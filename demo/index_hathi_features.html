  <h1>A guided tour of the digital library</h1>
</div>

<div id="body">
  <p>In the last 20 years, librarians and technology companies have scanned millions upon millions of books from research libraries. This is a significant portion of all the intellectual work published in the West before the rise of the Internet. What, actually, is <em>in</em> this vast new archive? How big is it? What kinds of books does it contain, and which ones are worth looking at again? Librarians and information scientists have been working for the past decade to make a substantial proportion of these books accessible through the <a href="http://hathitrust.org">Hathi Trust</a>. But we lack ways‚Äìeven bad ways‚Äìto see the entire digital library at once.</p>
  <p>You‚Äôre probably used to browsing books by one of the various library classification systems in common use; the best known is the Dewey Decimal system. But especially at the research level, different libraries use different classification systems. Many research libraries organize using the Library of Congress Classification (LCC); but only about a third of the books in Hathi even have a LCC number associated with them.</p>
  <p>The only thing we have for all of these books is their text. The visualization here provides a new way of exploring this vast digital library using a new method that makes a visual arrangement of books possible based on the vocabulary they use, using the method from <a href="http://culturalanalytics.org/2018/09/stable-random-projection-lightweight-general-purpose-dimensionality-reduction-for-digitized-libraries/">my new paper on ‚ÄúStable Random Projection.‚Äù</a><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> I‚Äôve taken inspiration in this from some other other maps of large collections of books and images, but this tries to take on a considerably more diverse and important set of cultural artifacts.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
  <p>You can visually browse through a library of 14 million volumes (about as many as there are books in the Library of Congress) and click on any one to see the original in the HathiTrust digital library.</p>

  <p>The biggest organizing principal at this level is in the general subject matter of the book.

To see the full names of the classes, click the button below.</p>
  <p>While many disparate books are positioned alongside each other, there is fairly strong separation in these various areas between different subject subject headings. When two radically different methods‚Äìlibrarians reading, and vectorized document representations‚Äìcoincide even this much, you can safely conclude that both are tapping into something real.</p>
  <p>But I should say for the machine-credulous: this doesn‚Äôt mean that this particular clustering is the be-all and end-all of machine reading. If I ran the algorithm again or with different parameters, the layout could be quite different. The point is simply; if a pattern emerges in this low-dimensional representation, it probably also exists in the space defined by a book‚Äôs vocabulary.</p>

  <p>A second cluster lives towards the eastern side.

  <p>Just to the northwest are works about botany, plants, and parts of zoology; they have less to do with medicine in their language, but cluster back into with the bulk of the biological sciences.

  <p>The S classes‚Äìagriculture, general‚Äìare one of the major areas where the historical origins of the LC classification in the early 20th century are evident. Agriculture‚Äìa major area of study at US universities, and the employment area of a third of the population‚Äìseemed to logically command a top-level heading.

  <p>P is divided into two large macro chunks. One contains scholarly work <em>about</em> literature; much of this has lexical similarities to history and biography.</p>
  <p>The inability to distinguish between these two chunks from library metadata is something that‚Äôs frequently frustrating to scholars of digital literature.</p>
  <p>That they show up in clearly distinct chunks here is a good thing; it suggests that it will be relatively easily to use machine learning tools to tell them apart in cases where the metadata isn‚Äôt clear. (This conforms with what Ted Underwood‚Äôs white paper on the subject has found, but using a considerably smaller dataset.)<span class="citation" data-cites="underwood_understanding_2014"><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></span></p>

  <p>The other chunk is actual literature, which occupies one wing off the side of the full English-Language set.

  <p>The major chunks in this cluster are literary <em>genre</em>.

Not all that many works are helpful enough to identity themselves. But even with most literature removed, enough remain to make it clear that the main areas here represent poetry, prose, and plays.</p>
  <p>(You may see several big chunks of ‚Äòplays‚Äô hovering around the edges of poetry; many of these are 18th-century plays in verse. The diction in these in some ways resembles poetry more than it does, say, Tennessee Williams.)</p>

  <p>But while this resembles a library classification in certain ways, using full text also lets us play <em>against</em> the decisions about where a book belongs that constrain where it falls on the shelf. While almost all poetry is classed as literature, there are also rare works of history, biography, and economics in the libraries that are themselves in verse.</p>
  <p>Looking at the poetry cluster but hiding literature surfaces these oddball works like <em>A Metrical History of the Life and Times of Napoleon Bonaparte</em> and historical poems about William Penn or the Spanish conquest of the new world.</p>
  <p>Using these kind of filters produces, at times, some spectacularly convoluted verse, as when <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc2.ark%3A%2F13960%2Ft3rv0h75t;view=plaintext;seq=251;page=root;size=100;orient=0">Thomas Dibdin tries to make the British national debt rhyme in his history of England</a>: <img src="/images/poemsAboutDebt.jpg" alt="An image of a poem: text reading War with the Dutch adds to our troubles, 1781.

  <p>Within the whole of poetry, these works can fade away. But the ability to surface them is one of the ways even a mediocre machine-ordering of the digital library can be useful. As we zoom back out to the scale of poetry generally, you can see a large number of works that‚Äìalthough librarians correctly class them as something other than poetry‚Äìstill share something in their language with the genre. This suggests one of the ways that this visualization can do is to look at places where the substance of texts does not match up with the ordering placed on them in a classification system.</p>
  <p>Another thing it can help us with is understanding the <em>scale</em> of the library. Within the poetry cluster here are tens of thousands of books. Scholars in the humanities who are thought to work with ‚ÄúBig Data‚Äù operate, for the most part, at the upper limits of this scale. One of the foundational texts in Digital Humanities for thinking about how to deal with large libraries was Gregory Crane‚Äôs article ‚ÄúWhat do you do with a million books.‚Äù<span class="citation" data-cites="jockers_macroanalysis:_2013 crane_what_2006 underwood_transformation_2018"><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></span></p>

  <p>This doesn‚Äôt mean that the original classifications are wrong. If the library profession started over they would certainly not come up with the same ordering of knowledge as in the Library of Congress Classification; but the system has many principles (class by subject ahead of place; follow the intent of the author when choosing between plausible alternatives) that are sensible, useful, and unlikely to be easily reproduced algorithmically.</p>
  <p>The point is, rather, that the ways computer classifies can sometimes reflect reality more sensitively than a rigid set of rules. Computers can be more flexible than bureaucracies.</p>
  <p>Here, for instance, is a set of books that, for the most part, mix Spanish and English together in their contents. Some are classified in the metadata as Spanish, some as English, and some as multiple languages. But they share a linguistic commonality.</p>

  <p>One section like this shows the importance of non-academic writing in academic libraries. Libraries are full of instructional manuals about how to do things.

  <p>In the library, sports is shelved in a distinct section of class G (recreation). But clustering purely on language, these works stand near not anthropology and geography, but instead in the broader neighborhood of a library of self-improvement for non-experts.</p>

  <p>This serves as a useful reminder that the digital library scholars work with is itself the production of a strange set of machine hallucinations of text. Most of the library books in Hathi were converted to digital files by Google; libraries serve the Google scans. Google‚Äôs optical character recognition (OCR) seems to work not a word or even a paragraph at a time, but over spans of several pages; it uses best estimates to make an assumption about the general character set of a book, and then tries to read it consistently in that light.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="chunk">
  <p>As an example of what constitutes this cluster, look at what happens when Google‚Äôs OCR encounters a page like this one, in <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=chi.11795930;view=plaintext;seq=166;page=root;size=100;orient=0">one of the volumes of the famous Framingham Heart Study,</a> which is flipped onto its side.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
  <figure>
  <img src="/images/Framingham.png" alt="Image of statistics on a page scanned oriented at 90 degrees" /><figcaption>Image of statistics on a page scanned oriented at 90 degrees</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Google‚Äôs program seems to fail to recognize the correct orientation and, instead, encodes it as a series of nonsense numbers and Greek letters. (Even letters that appear to be Roman, here, like ‚ÄúŒú‚Äù are, for the most part, their Greek equivalents.)</p>
  <pre><code>11Œô1510Œó0 3Œ†015Œë5 Œú ¬´3 . ŒßŒôŒúŒØŒΩŒó 30ŒùŒΩŒêŒóŒΩŒõŒü0-30ŒùŒΩŒêŒúŒΩŒõ 03&quot;Œô00&lt;1

  <p>When this is applied to title pages with the correct orientation, it produces ‚Äòwords‚Äô that try to use greek characters to spell out English. So ‚ÄúFertilizer use in the United States .. United States Department of Agriculture .. Bulletin No.¬†408‚Äù <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951d02888101x">emerges looking like this</a>:</p>

  <p>This gets to the heart of what it means for a book to be findable in the digital library, and why we need new forms of exploration.</p>
  <p>In the physical libraries of the past, a book is found or lost through human interpretations. If a book is misshelved or miscataloged, it can be functionally lost for weeks or years. To find a book lost in the stacks requires persistent manipulationns around the types of decisions human librarians might make.</p>
  <p>In a digital library, the kiss of death sometimes relies on understanding not human mistakes but <em>computer</em> mistakes. (Of course all computer mistakes are human mistakes, originally.) While subject headings rely on a human reading of a text, OCR is, essentially, a computer reading of a text. And if the computer reads the text disastrously wrong (like ‚ÄúœÖŒùŒôŒ§Œïœã 5Œ§ŒëŒ§Œï5‚Äù for ‚ÄúUNITED STATES‚Äù), you might think the book is, fundamentally lost. No keyword search will ever find the Framingham Heart Study.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="chunk">
  <p>But it‚Äôs too easy to leave things there; because all these volumes <em>are</em> clustered together based on the character strings that occur in them, which means that even if the relationships can‚Äôt be found by people using human terms, we can tease something out of the full-scale relations.</p>
  <p>Spend some more time browsing around this map, and you‚Äôll this same pattern again and again; here, for example, is a big set of musical scores.</p>
