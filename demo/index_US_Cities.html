      <div class="chunk">
        <p>This is a narrative description of the city populations dataset I‚Äôve assembled for the <em>Creating Data</em>
          project. The headline here is: Wikipedia editors have created a much more comprehensive database of American
          city and town populations than historians have had to this point.</p>
        <p>I‚Äôm writing it up separately and releasing it before any other components of the project for two reasons.
          First, the data is useful: there are a wide variety of fields where a more comprehensive, long-term database
          of city sizes is useful, and I‚Äôve already spoken to a few people for whom it might be useful. (If you wish to
          download the data, you can do it <a href="https://github.com/CreatingData/Historical-Populations">from the
            github site for this dataset.</a>)</p>
        <p>Second, I wanted to use it to try a beta launch for some of the narrative display elements of this project.
          I‚Äôm trying something here that‚Äôs a central part of the full project: finding ways to explore through
          historical data that allow both narrative and exploratory data analysis.</p>
        <p>Note that it‚Äôs still missing plenty of pieces, such as a loading bar! But if you want to see tens of
          thousands cities dancing around the screen, this is the right place‚Ä¶</p>
        <p>The left side of this page is narration: the right lets you poke around this dataset as you please. If you
          want to free up the full page for the map, there‚Äôs a bar to contract at the right edge of the text block.
          Otherwise, scroll down for a walk through the data. If you don‚Äôt eventually see a map load, let me know.</p>

        <p>The initial page of this page showed all cities United States with a population over 50,000; there are
          several hundred in the primary dataset I‚Äôm using for this, created by Stanford‚Äôs CESTA. But the CESTA dataset,
          which I thought for several years was the best in existence, contains about 7,500 cities and towns across the
          country with populations going back, in many cases, 1790. This data uses a broad definition of ‚Äúplace‚Äù before
          1940, and something approximating the current census-designated-place afterwards.</p>

        <p>This dataset is both good and well-vetted; it comes from cooperation between Stanford and Census bureau
          itself, and can be used for a variety of purposes. Here, for example, you can the population change over the
          1950s and 1960s as the major urban centers of the industrial midwest (Detroit, Cleveland, Chicago, St.¬†Louis)
          lose population even as their suburbs grow dramatically.</p>

        <p>But it turns out to be far from the best possible. From reading nineteenth census reports, I knew that the
          published government figures included up to dozens of summary population statistics for each county. I noticed
          last year that these were starting to turn up on Wikipedia for towns much smaller than any of the published
          datasets contain. Here is the Wikipedia page for Montville, Maine, a small town with about 1,000 people.
          Wikipedia has long had <em>current</em> census information on places like this. But now it has the population
          from Montville‚Äôs year of peak population, 1840. This is information no one has been willing to pay to type up
          from the original census reports‚Äìnot even Stanford and the US government.</p>

          <figcaption>Montville, Maine</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Nationwide, CESTA only includes information for cities with a population over 2,500: Montville never reached
          this threshold, and so doesn‚Äôt appear. So how much of this stuff is in Wikipedia? And how does it compare to
          what academics have right now?</p>

          interested in their own history. You can see how much better the resolution on those states is by comparing

          This is more than three times as many cities and towns. The midwest comes alive; suddenly, you can essentially
          see the rail lines running through Missouri and Kansas themselves, as well as thecities that the railroads
          built up on themselves.</p>

        <p>This data entry entry is really incredible work. You might think of it as as testament to the power of
          crowd-sourcing. This isn‚Äôt crazy: but as with so much Wikipedia labor, this is almost entirely the work of a
          single person: Jacob Alperin-Sheriff, who undertook the work while a graduate student at Georgia Tech. (He is
          now works in cryptographer for the government). Posting the populations to Wikipedia under the username
          ‚ÄúDemocraticLuntz,‚Äù he entered approximate 25,000 cities and counties from the census, accounting for about
          237,707 non-zero entries. That‚Äôs almost four times as many data points as the CESTA-Stanford set. It includes
          both towns not included in the CESTA set, and earlier years of growth from towns that spent several years
          below the census bureau‚Äôs cutoff of 2,500.</p>
        <p>To build the union dataset you see here, I contacted Alperin-Sheriff, who sent me the CSV files he typed up
          before uploading them to Wikipedia. I also parsed every article in Wikipedia to find other articles that have
          a population history box. I then matched these to the CESTA data and each other using the population numbers
          as a key, and string similarity to break ties. In cases of disagreement (more about those in a bit), I‚Äôve used
          whatever element seems to produce the smoothest overall growth.</p>

        <p>Things are expecially remarkable up in the the northeast of the country, where ‚Äòtowns‚Äô and ‚Äòtownships‚Äô

          eighteenth century. Outside of Indian reservations and a few unincorporated area in Maine, this gives the
          locations of pretty much every person in New England to within a few miles.</p>

          it makes it possible to see patterns at a resolution that isn‚Äôt possible using only large cities and counties
          to map.</p>
        <p>Here, for instance, is a map of <em>when</em> a city gained most of its population. This is a pretty good way
          of putting a single year on any city, better than (say) year of maximum population; you can think of it as

          You see this in a variety of places; Chicago neighborhoods, for example, are broken out as population centers

        <p>Take, for example, the odd rectangular cluster at the bottom of Michigan around the city of Battle Creek when

          You can see similar groups throughout the midwest‚Äìit‚Äôs a reminder of how much finer-grained the Census data

        <p>Fortunately, there is a heuristic that gives much more consistent data: filter to datasets that have a
          defined population in Jacob Alperin-Sheriff‚Äôs edits. Alperin-Sheriff used regular nationwide rules for what to
          include that make his data less of a hodgepodge than even the CESTA set, let alone Wikipedia.</p>
        <p>The non-Alperin wikipedia entries (in red here) are almost never for clear-cut locations, but instead cover
          things like Chicago neighborhoods or those Michigan townships. Sometimes the data is quite good, but
          sometimes‚Äìas with townships in the state of Pennsylvania‚Äìit is only entered for a few years. (There is one
          case in the Alperin-Sheriff data of truncated entry; there seem to only be Massachusetts town populations
          after 1850.)</p>
        <p>The two big exceptions are the state of Hawaii‚Äìwhich uses census-designated places, not municipalities, and
          so is not in the Alperin-Sheriff set at all‚Äìand no-longer extant municipalities like Brooklyn, New York or
          ghost towns like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swansea,_Arizona">Swansea, Arizona.</a>
          Alperin-Sheriff‚Äôs raw data <em>does</em> include New York municipalities, but for the dataset here I use his

        <p>It‚Äôs still worth, though, using all the data in order to get as close to the <em>correct</em> populations as
          possible.</p>
        <p>There are conflicts between the various sources that are not trivial to resolve. Wikipedia‚Äôs numbers are
          identical to Alperin-Sheriff‚Äôs numbers are only about 99% of the time, and only about 96% of the time to the
          CESTA numbers.</p>
        <p>All the cities in red here are ones for which there is some internal disagreement among the three datasets
          here (Wikipedia, Alperin source files, and CESTA data) in the <strong>1890</strong> census. I‚Äôve checked the
          <a href="https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html">original census report from 1890</a> for each of
          these places.</p>
        <p>These are just some examples.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Morris, Illinois</strong> is short by 600 people in the Wikipedia and Alperin sets, but is correct
            in CESTA;</li>
          <li><strong>Conneaut, Ohio</strong> has a repeated 1 in the Alperin-Sheriff set that makes the amount ten
            times greater; Wikipedia editors have corrected it to the same value as the CESTA number.</li>
          <li><strong>New Haven, Connecticut</strong> is 6,000 lower in the Alperin numbers because he uses the
            population for ‚ÄúNew Haven City,‚Äù while Wikipedia and CESTA use a larger census population for ‚ÄúNew Haven
            Town,‚Äù which includes the city and other municipalities.</li>
          <li><strong>Coal Hill, Arkansas</strong> is listed as 802 in the Wikipedia and the Alperin-Sheriff
            transcriptions, but only 202 in the CESTA set. The original census publications list the population as 802.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Winston-Salem, North Carolina</strong> is listed as 10729 in the Wikipedia sources and 10700 in
            CESTA, which sometimes rounds to the nearest hundred. The combined populations of the two cities of Winston
            and Salem was 10,729 in 1890.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In cases like this, the headline population in the merged dataset is created by selecting the number that
          produces the smoothest overall growth curve between existing values. The purpose of this is to ensure that
          egregiously wrong values won‚Äôt be included.</p>
        <pre class="api"><code>{&quot;year&quot;:1890,

        <p>The last example is an especially interesting one that points in the direction of future needs to improve
          data like this. Winston and Salem were independent cities at the time of the 1890 census, and to list them as
          joint is‚Äìstrictly speaking‚Äìincorrect. CESTA, unlike Wikipedia, <em>does</em> have statistics for the
          independent cities of Winston and Salem for part of this period; Alperin-Sheriff seems to have manually
          combined populations of merged cities for certain municipalities such as <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegheny,_Pennsylvania">Allegheny</a> and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In
          other cases of municpal merger, such as Brooklyn and New York City, or <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dover-Foxcroft,_Maine">Dover and Foxcroft, Maine</a>, only the
          population of the larger municipality is included. While some extinct municipalities receive their own pages
          with population boxes (like Allegheny), others (including Winston, Salem, Dover, and Foxcroft) do not.</p>
        <p>There is some room for using Wikipedia text, along with addition, subtraction, and <em>county</em> level
          populations, to create the full network of when cities merge with each other. I have not attempted to do this.
        </p>
        <p>Ultimately, the best way to solve this would require returning to the original census reports, which have
          detailed footnotes about all mergers. It seems possible to me that the thousands of points collected here
          could be useful in training OCR and column-discrimination models across those reports, but that task is
          probably not going to be possible for several years.</p>
