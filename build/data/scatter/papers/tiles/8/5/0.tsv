Stimulation of neural tissue at low-frequency however poses new challenges on conventional electrode materials which support limited charge transfer in the desired frequency range, from less than 0.1 Hz to several tens of Hz. In our study we address this challenge by investigating the charge transfer properties of PEDOT/PSS coatings for low-frequency applications, focusing on the impact of the polymer bulk. PEDOT films of various thicknesses were exposed to low-frequency as well as DC stimulation textbfin vitro and compared to Pt and IrOx electrodes as controls. The charge injection performance of the metallic substrates could be substantially improved already by a thin PEDOT coating. Additionally a linear dependency between charge injection and polymer thickness suggests that PEDOT coatings are promising as materials for future ACS applications.	coating excipient;electroencephalography;epilepsy;frequency band;hertz (hz);less than;nerve tissue;parkinson disease;parkinsonian disorders;physical symbol system;polymer;thickness (graph theory);transcranial alternating current stimulation;transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation;electrode;emotional dependency;nervous system disorder	Christian Boehler;Maria Asplund	2018	2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2018.8512597	electronic engineering;optoelectronics;electric potential;electrode;pedot:pss;coating;stimulation;computer science	Visualization	25.095823465120652	-84.28267504749542	16301

In fact, a recent medical report reveals that while other types of cancer are experiencing negative growth, breast cancer has been the only one with a positive growth rate over the last few years. This is primarily due to the fact that 1) examination process is a complex and lengthy one and 2) it is not available to the majority of women who live in remote sites. Currently for mammography screening, women have to go to doctors or cancer centers/hospitals annually while high-risk patients may have to visit more often. One way to resolve these problems is by the use of advanced networking technologies and signal processing algorithms. On one hand, software modules can help detect, with high precision, true negatives (TN), while marking true positives (TP) for further investigation. Unavoidably, in this process some false negatives (FN) will be generated that are potentially life threatening; however, inclusion of the detection software improves the TP detection and, hence, reduces FNs drastically. Since TNs are the majority of examinations on a randomly selected population, this first step reduces the load on radiologists by a tremendous amount. On the other hand, high-speed networking equipment can accelerate the required clinic-lab connection and make detection, segmentation, and image enhancement algorithms readily available to the radiologists. This will bring the breast cancer care, caregiver, and the facilities to the patients and expand diagnostics and treatment to the remote sites. This research describes asynchronous transfer mode telemammography network (ATMTN) architecture for real-time, online screening, detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. ATMTN is a unique high-speed network integrated with automatic robust computer-assisted diagnosis-detection/digital signal processing (CAD/DSP) methods for mass detection, region of interest (ROI) compression algorithms using Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) 3.0 medical image standard. While ATMTN has the advantage of higher penetration into the women for cancer screening, it provides the diagnosis with higher efficiency, better accuracy and potentially lower cost. This paper presents the development of the infrastructure and algorithm design for ATMTN-based telemammography. The research goals involved: 1) networking stations for telemammography to demonstrate, evaluate, and validate technologies and methods for delivering mammography screening services via high-speed (155 MB/s) links, performing real-time network-transmitted, high-resolution mammograms for immediate diagnosis as a """"second opinion"""" strategy; 2) development of object-oriented compression methods for storage, retrieval and transmission of mammograms; 3) inclusion and optimization of detection algorithms for identification of normal images in different resolutions to increase the speed and effectiveness of telemammography as a """"second opinion"""" strategy; 4) resolving the compatibility issues between images from different equipment (DICOM standards); and 5) optimization of an integrated ATMTN with adaptive CAD/DSP methods that are robust for large image databases and input sources."""	algorithm design;computer assisted diagnosis;computer-aided design;dicom;data compression;data rate units;database;digital imaging and communications in medicine (dicom);digital signal processing;eighty;goto;image editing;image resolution;item unique identification;mammary neoplasms;mathematical optimization;medical device incompatibility problem;medical image;nc (complexity);nci-designated cancer center;national cancer institute;network architecture;networking hardware;patients;radiology;randomness;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;region of interest;screening for cancer;screening mammography;true hermaphroditism (disorder);true quantified boolean formula;twisted nematic field effect;standards characteristics;transmission process	Ehsan Sheybani;Ravi Sankar	2002	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2002.805556	computer vision;simulation;radiology;medicine;image processing;computer science;electrical engineering;signal processing;biological engineering;cancer	Graphics	35.36802159763704	-80.33611164665503	16504

The use of preoperative imaging for guidance is standard of care, but tumor margins are not always clear even when contrast agents are used, and so margins are often determined intraoperatively by visual and tactile feedback. Ultrasound strain imaging creates a quantitative representation of tissue stiffness which can be used in real-time. The information offered by strain imaging can be placed within a conventional image-guidance workflow by tracking the ultrasound probe and calibrating the image plane, which facilitates interpretation of the data by placing it within a common coordinate space with preoperative imaging. Tumor geometry in strain imaging is then directly comparable to the geometry in preoperative imaging. This paper presents a tracked ultrasound strain imaging system capable of co-registering with preoperative tomograms and also of reconstructing a 3D surface using the border of the strain lesion. In a preliminary study using four phantoms with subsurface tumors, tracked strain imaging was registered to preoperative image volumes and then tumor surfaces were reconstructed using contours extracted from strain image slices. The volumes of the phantom tumors reconstructed from tracked strain imaging were approximately between 1.5 to 2.4 cm, which was similar to the CT volumes of 1.0 to 2.3 cm. Future work will be done to robustly characterize the reconstruction accuracy of the system.	ct scan;displacement mapping;image plane;imaging phantom;real-time clock;tomography;tracking system	Thomas S.

Physical examination and computed tomographic (CT) imaging data must be combined with detailed anatomic, physiologic, and biomechanical knowledge to assess the injured subject. We are developing a methodology to automate reasoning about penetrating injuries using canonical knowledge combined with specific subject image data.   METHODS AND MATERIAL In our approach, we build a three-dimensional geometric model of a subject from segmented images. We link regions in this model to entities in two knowledge sources: (1) a comprehensive ontology of anatomy containing organ identities, adjacencies, and other information useful for anatomic reasoning and (2) an ontology of regional perfusion containing formal definitions of arterial anatomy and corresponding regions of perfusion. We created computer reasoning services (""""problem solvers"""") that use the ontologies to evaluate the geometric model of the subject and deduce the consequences of penetrating injuries.   RESULTS We developed and tested our methods using data from the Visible Human. Our problem solvers can determine the organs that are injured given particular trajectories of projectiles, whether vital structures--such as a coronary artery--are injured, and they can predict the propagation of injury ensuing after vital structures are injured.   CONCLUSION We have demonstrated the capability of using ontologies with medical images to support computer reasoning about injury based on those images. Our methodology demonstrates an approach to creating intelligent computer applications that reason with image data, and it may have value in helping practitioners in the assessment of penetrating injury."""	anatomic structures;artificial intelligence;automated reasoning;ct scan;computer;confusion;declarative programming;entity;geometric modeling;medical imaging;multidetector computed tomography;ontology (information science);organ;sense of identity (observable entity);software propagation;traumatic injury;triage;wounds, penetrating	Daniel L.

1f8db1d68ce523dfd4d672f148bb023031350b0c	normalized gradient fields cross-correlation for automated detection of prostate in magnetic resonance images	magnetism;cancer;image fusion;scanners;biopsy;computing systems;ultrasonography;diagnostics and therapeutics;prostate;prostate cancer	Fully automated prostate segmentation helps to address several problems in prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment: it can assist in objective evaluation of multiparametric MR imagery, provides a prostate contour for MR-ultrasound (or CT) image fusion for computer-assisted image-guided biopsy or therapy planning, may facilitate reporting and enables direct prostate volume calculation. Among the challenges in automated analysis of MR images of the prostate are the variations of overall image intensities across scanners, the presence of nonuniform multiplicative bias field within scans and differences in acquisition setup. Furthermore, images acquired with the presence of an endorectal coil suffer from localized high-intensity artifacts at the posterior part of the prostate. In this work, a three-dimensional method for fast automated prostate detection based on normalized gradient fields cross-correlation, insensitive to intensity variations and coil-induced artifacts, is presented and evaluated. The components of the method, offline template learning and the localization algorithm, are described in detail. The method was validated on a dataset of 522 T2-weighted MR images acquired at the National Cancer Institute, USA that was split in two halves for development and testing. In addition, second dataset of 29 MR exams from Centre d'Imagerie Medicale Tourville, France were used to test the algorithm. The 95% confidence intervals for the mean Euclidean distance between automatically and manually identified prostate centroids were 4.06 ± 0.33 mm and 3.10 ± 0.43 mm for the first and second test datasets respectively. Moreover, the algorithm provided the centroid within the true prostate volume in 100% of images from both datasets. Obtained results demonstrate high utility of the detection method for a fully automated prostate segmentation.© (2012) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

A known velocity profile was obtained using a straight tube flow rig. Colour Doppler ultrasound images were obtained and velocity profiles extracted off-line. There was a small discrepancy (2.6%) in maximum velocity, which was not present after convolution with the colour flow point spread function, hence is likely to be due to velocity gradient broadening within the sample volume. There was disagreement at the edge of the vessel due to loss of velocities below the clutter filter. At a typical clinical colour flow scale (12.8 cms/sup -1/) the error in wall shear measurement is 62 % and at a lower scale setting (4.4 cms/sup -1/) the error is 11%. This improvement seems to be due to the lower level of clutter filter that is used as the velocity scale decreases.	clutter;convolution;discrepancy function;gradient;online and offline;pulse-doppler radar;velocity (software development)	Siobhan Meagher;Tamie Poepping;John Cosgroave;Clive Greated;Peter Hoskins	2004	2004 2nd IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: Nano to Macro (IEEE Cat No. 04EX821)		medical imaging;radiology;acoustics;hemodynamics;shear flow;ultrasound;point spread function;optical transfer function;optics;stress;thermal velocity;beam	Vision	43.75646515576931	-85.45120006943264	17063
832a480b3710818b0c6a0d0fadec1a5a08d3d743	in vivo correlation between semi-quantitative hemodynamic parameters and ktrans derived from dce-mri of brain tumors	volume transfer constant;dynamic contrast enhanced;magnetic resonance imaging;initial area under the curve	Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become more and more widely applied in cancer diagnosis and treatment follow-up. Without complicated calculation, a semiquantitative parameter – modified initial area under the curve (mIAUCc) – was proposed for better correlation with volume transfer constant (K) by computer simulation. In this study, we aim to further investigate the correlation between mIAUCc and K trans in clinical. A total of 10 patients with brain tumors participated in this study and images were acquired by using a 3-Tesla clinical MR scanner. The results showed that mIAUCc was highly correlated with K trans with the correlation coefficient of 0.913. Although the ideals of K and mIAUCc are different, mIAUCc does the trick for brain tumors evaluations in DCE-MRI. It reveals that mIAUCc could be an alternative for physiological condition evaluation in DCE-MRI. VC 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

While the technique has been successfully used both in vitro and in vivo, there have been limited attempts to optimize single channel PS-OCT with respect to performance, particularly paddle rotation. In this study, we developed and tested a new approach for the real-time assessment of birefringence through tailoring of reference arm polarization. Different polarization rotation patterns, as depicted on a Poincare sphere, were assessed with polarization filters and retarders. When further tested in tissue, PS-OCT assessments of bovine cartilage and tendon demonstrated that contrast was sensitive to the pattern selected, indicating that rotation pattern influenced birefringence assessment and providing insights into optimal patterns. We also discuss the difference between diagnostic accuracy and precision with respect to both the construction and application of PS-OCT embodiments.	addresses (publication format);birefringence;bos taurus;categorical variable;degenerative polyarthritis;evaluation procedure;in vitro [publication type];myocardial infarction;optics;ps-algol;polarization (waves);polarizer;real-time transcription;tendon structure;video-in video-out;bovine cartilage extract;tomography	Bin Liu;Christopher Vercollone;Mark E.

However, the reconstruction methods are difficult to be objectively evaluated due to the complicated topology of coronary tree and non-linear cardiac motion. In this paper, we present a simulation environment of rotational angiography acquisition system to facilitate the improvements and the evaluations of reconstruction algorithms. A 3D+t coronary tree model reconstructed from MSCT sequence is employed to enhance the reality of simulation. A simulation environment of X-ray coronary angiography is developed based on distance-driven projection algorithm. The static angiography is firstly simulated to verify the dynamic model by comparing the displacements of landmarks with the real static angiography of the same patient. Rotational simulation results are then obtained with real system parameters to provide a complete and true-to-life RA sequence representing the morphology of moving coronary tree.	anatomy, regional;ct scan;evaluation;galaxy morphological classification;genetic algorithm;image resolution;mathematical model;nonlinear system;patients;projections and predictions;radiography;rotational angiography;simulation;traffic collision avoidance system;angiogram	Guanyu Yang;Yining Hu;Xi Huang;Huazhong Shu;Christine Toumoulin	2012	2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346010	iterative reconstruction;rotational angiography;computer vision;radiology;medicine;medical physics	Robotics	38.869555484314645	-85.19952076377072	17336
f2450762d9e38755a6aaa6b25e2fa14d74f96cf7	three-dimensional weighting in cone beam fbp reconstruction and its transformation over geometries		Goals: With substantially increased number of detector rows in multidetector CT (MDCT), axial scan with projection data acquired along a circular source trajectory has become the method-of-choice in increasing clinical applications. Recognizing the practical relevance of image reconstruction directly from the projection data acquired in the native cone beam (CB) geometry, especially in scenarios wherein the most achievable in-plane resolution is desirable, we present a three-dimensional (3-D) weighted CB-FBP algorithm in such geometry in this paper. Methods: We start the algorithm's derivation in the cone-parallel geometry. Via changing of variables, taking the Jacobian into account and making heuristic and empirical assumptions, we arrive at the formulas for 3-D weighted image reconstruction in the native CB geometry. Results: Using the projection data simulated by computer and acquired by an MDCT scanner, we evaluate and verify performance of the proposed algorithm for image reconstruction directly from projection data acquired in the native CB geometry.  Conclusion: The preliminary data show that the proposed algorithm performs as well as the 3-D weighted CB-FBP algorithm in the cone-parallel geometry. Significance: The proposed algorithm is anticipated to find its utility in extensive clinical and preclinical applications wherein the reconstruction of images in the native CB geometry, i.e., the geometry for data acquisition, is of relevance.	algorithm;ct scan;cone beam computed tomography;data acquisition;detectors;flow-based programming;heuristic;iterative reconstruction;jacobian matrix and determinant;modified discrete cosine transform;relevance;retinitis pigmentosa;scanner device component	Shaojie Tang;Kuidong Huang;Yunyong Cheng;Tianye Niu;Xiangyang Tang	2018	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2017.2711478	iterative reconstruction;computer vision;beam (structure);jacobian matrix and determinant;computed tomography;row;artificial intelligence;trajectory;data acquisition;computer science;weighting	Vision	44.65255684441518	-82.97991527138369	17569

In intracranial surgery, point-based registrations can be used with either skin-affixed or bone-implanted extrinsic objects called fiducial markers. The advantages of point-based registration techniques are that they are robust, fast, and have a well developed mathematical foundation for the assessment of registration quality. In abdominal image-guided procedures such techniques have not been successful. It is difficult to accurately locate sufficient homologous intrinsic points in imagespace and physical-space, and the implantation of extrinsic fiducial markers would constitute """"surgery before the surgery."""" Image-space to physical-space registration for abdominal organs has therefore been dominated by surfacebased registration techniques which are iterative, prone to local minima, sensitive to initial pose, and sensitive to percentage coverage of the physical surface. In our work in image-guided kidney surgery we have developed a composite approach using """"virtual fiducials."""" In an open kidney surgery, the perirenal fat is removed and the surface of the kidney is dotted using a surgical marker. A laser range scanner (LRS) is used to obtain a surface representation and matching high definition photograph. A surface to surface registration is performed using a modified iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm. The dots are extracted from the high definition image and assigned the three dimensional values from the LRS pixels over which they lie. As the surgery proceeds, we can then use point-based registrations to re-register the spaces and track deformations due to vascular clamping and surgical tractions.© (2011) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

6caaff388c4b2b74782c5dac22cdaf2d3d10293c	using nonlinear finite element models to analyse stress distribution during subluxation and torque required for dislocation of newly developed total hip structure after prosthetic impingement	prosthetic impingement;dislocation;torque;stress;total hip replacement	Dislocation is a serious potential complication of total hip replacement. Previous studies have proposed a newly developed total hip structure that meets the required oscillation angle of 120°, for which the chamfer on the acetabular liner rim was designed to enable the neck to impinge on the chamfer over a large area after impingement occurs. This study adopted the finite element method to further analyse the torque limits leading to dislocation and the contact stresses at the impingement and egress sites of the liner during subluxation. The compressive stress–strain curve for ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene is nonlinear. The results reveal that an adequate chamfer angle of the acetabular cup liner can significantly increase dislocation torque and decrease contact stress on the liner rim. By means of the new design, when the head–neck ratio (HNR) is 2.5 or 3.0, the maximum torque value that a 36-mm head can withstand is 1.38 (8.7 Nm/6.3 Nm) or 1.47 (8.4 Nm/5.7 Nm) times that of a 22-mm head, while the maximum stress of a 36-mm head is 0.41 (14.58 MPa/35.73 MPa) or 0.70 (33.71 MPa/47.90 MPa) times that of a 22-mm head. When the head diameters are identical, the dislocation torque of the HNR = 2.5 structure is slightly greater than that of the HNR = 3.0 structure (3.3–10.5%); thus, the newly developed structure can disperse contact stress, and the structure of a large head with a low HNR exhibits a higher dislocation torque value and lower stress.	3-mercaptopropionic acid;bone structure of ischium;chamfer;diameter (qualifier value);dislocations;egress filtering;entity name part qualifier - adopted;exhibits as topic;finite element method;head and neck neoplasms;hip replacement arthroplasty (procedure);hip structure;joint subluxations;liner device;molecular weight;nonlinear system;polyethylenes;total hip replacement (procedure)	Wei-Min Chi;Chien-Chung Lin;Ying-Jui Ho;Hsiao-Che Lin;Jian-Horng Chen	2017	Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing	10.1007/s11517-017-1673-3	electronic engineering;torque;mathematics;chamfer;finite element method;nonlinear system;surgery;subluxation;oscillation;dislocation;contact mechanics;composite material	Robotics	27.714773564550875	-85.941000705072	18125
9f1ea352050656a59f6e7cd27132714e84ae0b70	effects of design parameters of total hip components on the impingement angle and determination of the preferred liner skirt shape with an adequate oscillation angle		The oscillation angle (OsA), which is the sum of the impingement angles on the two sides when the prosthetic neck sways from the neutral axis of the acetabular cup to the liner rim, is one of the most important factors that can affect the range of motion of an artificial hip joint. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of total hip component design on the impingement angle. Our findings show that an increase in cup depth of the liner restricts the motion of the neck and results in a reduced impingement angle, while an increase in chamfer angle increases the impingement angle until it reaches a critical value when a further increase no longer results in an increase in impingement angle. The impingement angle is not only dependent on the head/neck ratio, but also on the head size itself. For most arbitrarily chosen cup depths and chamfer angles, the neck only impacts at one point on the liner. This study proposes a suitable combination of cup depth and chamfer angle and a preferred impact mode, which, if impingement does occur, enables the neck to impinge on the liner rim over a large area. Cup–neck combinations that have an adequate OsA with maximum femoral head coverage are presented.	angle closure glaucoma;apache axis;axis vertebra;brewster's angle;chamfer;gadget (computer science);head and neck neoplasms;head of femur;hip joint;liner device	Hsiao-Che Lin;Wei-Min Chi;Ying-Jui Ho;Jian-Horng Chen	2012	Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing	10.1007/s11517-012-1008-3	engineering;forensic engineering;engineering drawing;surgery	Robotics	27.632157327527477	-86.15722525487566	18406

It is therefore crucial to correct for susceptibility-induced distortions when performing diffusion studies using EPI. The susceptibility-induced field is caused by the object (head) disrupting the field and it is typically assumed that it remains constant within a framework defined by the object, (i.e. it follows the object as it moves in the scanner). However, this is only approximately true. When a non-spherical object rotates around an axis other than that parallel with the magnetic flux (the z-axis) it changes the way it disrupts the field, leading to different distortions. Hence, if using a single field to correct for distortions there will be residual distortions in the volumes where the object orientation is substantially different to that when the field was measured. In this paper we present a post-processing method for estimating the field as it changes with motion during the course of an experiment. It only requires a single measured field and knowledge of the orientation of the subject when that field was acquired. The volume-to-volume changes of the field as a consequence of subject movement are estimated directly from the diffusion data without the need for any additional or special acquisitions. It uses a generative model that predicts how each volume would look predicated on field change and inverts that model to yield an estimate of the field changes. It has been validated on both simulations and experimental data. The results show that we are able to track the field with high accuracy and that we are able to correct the data for the adverse effects of the changing field.	assumed;axis vertebra;distortion;encode;echo-planar imaging;estimated;generative model;optic axis of a crystal;resonance;scanning systems;simulation;video post-processing	Jesper L.

The whole flowchart comprises the four main parts, of which image registration and image reconstruction are of great significance, materialized the following innovative ideas. Firstly, mutual information measure is combined with morphological gradient information to contain fewer erroneous maxima and lead to the global maximum when registration. Secondly, the hybrid optimizer combined Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with Powell algorithm is proposed to restrain local maxima of mutual information function and to improve the registration accuracy. Thirdly, the multiresolution data structure based on Mallat decomposition not only improves the behavior of registration function, but also accelerates the algorithm speed. Finally, an improved Shear-Warp algorithm is proposed based on the sorted volumetric dataset for registered image stack, which can skip all of the transparent voxels and achieve faster speed. Experimental results demonstrate that the novel registration and reconstruction algorithms are effective and efficient to achieve the virtual three-dimensional gekko's cervical spinal cord successfully and the reconstruction result can be rotated, scaled, incised and measured arbitrarily, which is valuable to be applied to the other kinds of serial histology sections.

96efc290e2fb8be984884897361c1cc65db2fe9e	single frequency approximation of volume conductor models for deep brain stimulation using equivalent circuits		The objective of this study was to investigate the role of frequency-dependent material properties on the voltage response and neural activation in a volume conductor model for deep brain stimulation (DBS). A finite element model of the brain was developed comprising tissue heterogeneity of gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid, which was derived from magnetic resonance images of the SRI24 multi-channel brain atlas. A model of the Medtronic DBS 3387 lead surrounded by an encapsulation layer was positioned in the subthalamic nucleus (STN). The frequency-dependent properties of brain tissue and their single-frequency approximations were modelled as voltageand current-controlled equivalent circuits. The frequency of best approximation, for which the pulse deviation between the single-frequency and frequency-dependent voltage response were minimal, was computed in a frequency range between 130 Hz and 1:3 MHz. Single-frequency approximations of the DBS pulses and the resulting volume of tissue activated (VTA) were found to be in good agreement with the pulses and VTAs obtained from the frequency-dependent solution. Single-frequency approximations were computed by combining finite element method with equivalent circuits. This method allows a fast computation of the time-dependent voltage response in the proximity of the stimulated target by requiring only one finite element computation.	approximation algorithm;brain atlas;brain implant;computation;deep brain stimulation;direct-broadcast satellite;dispersive partial differential equation;encapsulation (networking);finite element method;frequency band;nucleus rtos;resonance;single-frequency network;super-twisted nematic display;transfer function;video post-processing	Christian Schmidt;Ursula van Rienen	2013			computer science;artificial intelligence;computer vision;conductor;deep brain stimulation;electronic engineering;equivalent circuit	ML	25.973099484528888	-83.97474592890777	18851

Today, the dual-detector SPECT system is the most common imaging system used in nuclear cardiology, and /sup 201/Tl and /sup 99m/Tc-sestamibi are the most common used radiopharmaceuticals. Since no new radiotracers and hardware have been introduced for many years, new methods such as dynamic cardiac SPECT may offer the only potential to improve risk stratification in cases of moderate to mild coronary artery disease. Dynamic imaging could be performed on every cardiac SPECT procedure to provide improved lesion contrast and better evaluation of viable myocardium. However, there are challenges in the development of hardware, radiopharmaceuticals, and data processing techniques for dynamic cardiac SPECT to realize its full potential.	dynamic imaging;medical imaging;polyethylene terephthalate	Grant T.

afeac9270149b927b592e2299d11095fbdf8d308	accurate 3d multi-marker tracking in x-ray cardiac sequences using a two-stage graph modeling approach		The in-depth analysis of heart movements under varying conditions is an important problem of cardiac surgery. To reveal the movement of relevant muscular parts, biplanar X-ray recordings of implanted radio-opaque markers are acquired. As manually locating these markers in the images is a very time-consuming task, our goal is to automate this process. Taking into account the difficulties in the recorded data such as missing detections or 2D occlusions, we propose a two-stage graph-based approach for both 3D tracklet and 3D track generation. In the first stage of our approach, we construct a directed acyclic graph of 3D observations to obtain tracklets via shortest path optimization. Afterwards, full tracks are extracted from a tracklet graph in a similar manner. This results in a globally optimal linking of detections and tracklets, while providing a flexible framework which can easily be adapted to various tracking scenarios based on the edge cost functions. We validate our approach on an X-ray sequence of a beating sheep heart based on manually labeled ground-truth marker positions. The results show that the performance of our method is comparable to human experts, while standard 3D tracking approaches such as particle filters are outperformed.	directed acyclic graph;experiment;ground truth;map;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;particle filter;sensor;shortest path problem;technical support;x-ray (amazon kindle)	Xiaoyan Jiang;Daniel Haase;Marco Körner;Wolfgang Bothe;Joachim Denzler	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-40246-3_15	computer vision;simulation;artificial intelligence;machine learning	Vision	39.59355511425141	-81.65736359064036	18956

2202fb98caa2c629c72423848493cc8733c92995	integration of electro-anatomical and imaging data of the left ventricle: an evaluation framework	cardiac arrythmias;mri;quasi conformal mapping;electro anatomical mapping	Integration of electrical and structural information for scar characterization in the left ventricle (LV) is a crucial step to better guide radio-frequency ablation therapies, which are usually performed in complex ventricular tachycardia (VT) cases. This integration requires finding a common representation where to map the electrical information from the electro-anatomical map (EAM) surfaces and tissue viability information from delay-enhancement magnetic resonance images (DE-MRI). However, the development of a consistent integration method is still an open problem due to the lack of a proper evaluation framework to assess its accuracy. In this paper we present both: (i) an evaluation framework to assess the accuracy of EAM and imaging integration strategies with simulated EAM data and a set of global and local measures; and (ii) a new integration methodology based on a planar disk representation where the LV surface meshes are quasi-conformally mapped (QCM) by flattening, allowing for simultaneous visualization and joint analysis of the multi-modal data. The developed evaluation framework was applied to estimate the accuracy of the QCM-based integration strategy on a benchmark dataset of 128 synthetically generated ground-truth cases presenting different scar configurations and EAM characteristics. The obtained results demonstrate a significant reduction in global overlap errors (50-100%) with respect to state-of-the-art integration techniques, also better preserving the local topology of small structures such as conduction channels in scars. Data from seventeen VT patients were also used to study the feasibility of the QCM technique in a clinical setting, consistently outperforming the alternative integration techniques in the presence of sparse and noisy clinical data. The proposed evaluation framework has allowed a rigorous comparison of different EAM and imaging data integration strategies, providing useful information to better guide clinical practice in complex cardiac interventions.	anatomy, regional;benchmark (computing);cicatrix;dna integration;embedded atom model;ground truth;heart ventricle;imagery;implantable cardioverter-defibrillator;left ventricular structure;logical volume management;magnetic resonance imaging;modal logic;numerous;patients;photon correlation spectroscopy;polygon mesh;radio frequency;silo (dataset);sparse matrix;tachycardia;tachycardia, ventricular	David Soto-Iglesias;Constantine Butakoff;David Andreu;Juan Fernández-Armenta;Antonio Berruezo;Oscar Camara	2016	Medical image analysis	10.1016/j.media.2016.03.010	radiology;medicine;magnetic resonance imaging	Vision	43.53030601281693	-80.80780675171358	19177

Image processing gains more and more territory in pathology, our current study aims to apply image cytometry to this area. One of the most fundamental methods is ploidy analysis that aims to measure the pace of proliferation in the tissue. This is proven to be a good marker of tumor presence and aggressivity. Ploidy analysis traditionally is a flow cytometry area. The samples used in our study are the same as those used in a flow cytometer: a droplet of the suspension containing stained nuclei caught on a glass slide, covered and scanned. This article aims to show our progress in nucleus detection on digitized samples of propidium iodide stained cell nuclei suspensions. A previous article covered the assay method constructed and the initial segmentation technique used for nuclei detection, and identified its shortcomings based on the results.

Among them, intraneural electrodes are very promising because they represent an interesting trade-off between the needs for high selectivity and for reduced invasiveness. However, in most of the cases, no particular attention has been devoted so far to the design of these systems starting from the mechanical properties of the system to be interfaced. The aim of this paper was to study and characterize in a quantitative way the piercing of peripheral nervous tissue in order to gather useful information to design intraneural interfaces able to reduce (as much as possible) the damages provoked by this task. In particular, attention has been paid to determine the values of force and pressure to carry out the piercing task in different velocity conditions. From the experimental data it was possible to characterize indirectly the tissue sinking under the needle tip. For each experimental velocity (ranging from 1 to 2000 mm/min) a threshold, under which the tissue cannot be pierced, has been calculated. The force magnitude required for piercing was shown to be in the range 0.3-25 mN for the different velocities. Moreover, differences between piercing carried out at very low velocity (multi-piercing) and at low velocity (mono-piercing) have been characterized and correlated with the physical characteristics of the nervous tissue. Experimental data have been integrated with a theoretical analysis of the neural interfaces piercing structures. The problem of buckling, representing for these structures the main cause of tissue piercing impossibility, has been analyzed. The nonlinear theoretical model allows to compare different needle geometries and materials with regard to piercing possibility at different velocities. Moreover, an optimization of piercing elements geometry with regard to amount of used material and space has been provided	bionics;body piercing;buckling;cns disorder;congenital neurologic anomalies;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;millimeter per minute;millinewton;nerve tissue;neuroprosthetics;nonlinear system;numerous;peripheral;selectivity (electronic);theory;velocity (software development);electrode;neuroprosthesis	Pier Nicola Sergi;Maria Chiara Carrozza;Paolo Dario;Silvestro Micera	2006	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2006.879463	engineering;biomechanics;biological engineering;buckling;physiology;neurophysiology;force;physics;quantum mechanics;surgery;mechanical engineering	Robotics	25.544166927043026	-85.20327864065159	19574

5200f30fc08a94ebb1ac54dded939f86b57ead55	evaluation of deformable image registration for three-dimensional temporal subtraction of chest computed tomography images		Purpose To perform lung image registration for reducing misregistration artifacts on three-dimensional (3D) temporal subtraction of chest computed tomography (CT) images, in order to enhance temporal changes in lung lesions and evaluate these changes after deformable image registration (DIR).   Methods In 10 cases, mutual information (MI) lung mask affine mapping combined with cross-correlation (CC) lung diffeomorphic mapping was used to implement lung volume registration. With advanced normalization tools (ANTs), we used greedy symmetric normalization (greedy SyN) as a transformation model, which involved MI-CC-SyN implementation. The resulting displacement fields were applied to warp the previous (moving) image, which was subsequently subtracted from the current (fixed) image to obtain the lung subtraction image.   Results The average minimum and maximum log-Jacobians were 0.31 and 3.74, respectively. When considering 3D landmark distance, the root-mean-square error changed from an average of 20.82 mm for Pfixed to Pmoving to 0.5 mm for Pwarped to Pfixed. Clear shadows were observed as enhanced lung nodules and lesions in subtraction images. The lesion shadows showed lesion shrinkage changes over time. Lesion tissue morphology was maintained after DIR.   Conclusions DIR (greedy SyN) effectively and accurately enhanced temporal changes in chest CT images and decreased misregistration artifacts in temporal subtraction images.	body dysmorphic disorders;ct scan;carcinoma of lung;conflict (psychology);cross-correlation;database normalization;displacement mapping;ethanol 0.7 ml/ml topical gel;galaxy morphological classification;greedy algorithm;image registration;large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping;lipomatosis, multiple symmetrical;lung diseases;mathematical morphology;morphologic artifacts;mutual information;patients;psychologic displacement;radiology;review board;structure of parenchyma of lung;x-ray computed tomography;registration - actclass	Ping Yan;Yoshie Kodera;Kazuhiro Shimamoto	2017		10.1155/2017/3457189	computer vision;artificial intelligence;normalization (statistics);computed tomography;subtraction;affine transformation;image registration;computer science;lung volumes	Vision	39.71910746364434	-80.63071023605153	20331

In particular, the hemodynamics of left ventricle (LV) has attracted the attention of the researchers due to its significant role in the heart functionality. In this study, CFD owing its capability of predicting detailed flow field was adopted to model the blood flow in images-based patient-specific LV over cardiac cycle. In most published studies, the blood is modeled as Newtonian that is not entirely accurate as the blood viscosity varies with the shear rate in non-linear manner. In this paper, we studied the effect of Newtonian assumption on the degree of accuracy of intraventricular hemodynamics. In doing so, various non-Newtonian models and Newtonian model are used in the analysis of the intraventricular flow and the viscosity of the blood. Initially, we used the cardiac MRI images to reconstruct the time-resolved geometry of the patient-specific LV. After the unstructured mesh generation, the simulations were conducted in the CFD commercial solver FLUENT to analyze the intraventricular hemodynamic parameters. The findings indicate that the Newtonian assumption cannot adequately simulate the flow dynamic within the LV over the cardiac cycle, which can be attributed to the pulsatile and recirculation nature of the flow and the low blood shear rate.	cfd gene;ct scan;cardiovascular diseases;color gradient;computational fluid dynamics;entity name part qualifier - adopted;heart ventricle;heart failure;hemodynamics;hydrodynamics;left ventricular structure;logical volume management;medical ultrasound;mesh generation;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;patients;resonance;scientific publication;simulation;solver;ultrasonography;x-ray computed tomography	Siamak N.

To tackle this challenge, a novel system for 3D image reconstruction based on gaze tracking of the contralateral eye has been proposed. The gaze fixates on several target points and, for each fixation, the pose of the examined eye is inferred from the gaze tracking. A single camera system has been developed for pose estimation combined with subject-specific parameter identification. The ultrasound images are then transformed to the coordinate system of the examined eye to create a 3D volume. Accuracy of the proposed gaze tracking system and the pose estimation of the eye have been validated in a set of experiments. Overall system error, including pose estimation and calibration, are 3.12 mm and 4.68 degrees.	3d pose estimation;experiment;eye tracking;inference;information;iterative reconstruction;population parameter;tracking system;ultrasound transducer	Narges Afsham;Mohammad Najafi;Purang Abolmaesumi;Robert Rohling	2011	Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ...

However, there has been little translation of these findings into practical TMS research. This study uses the International 10-20 EEG electrode placement system to position a standard figure-of-eight TMS coil over 13 commonly adopted targets. Using a finite element method and an anatomically detailed and realistic head model, this study provides the first pictorial and numerical atlas of TMS-induced electric fields for a range of coil positions. The results highlight the importance of subject-specific gyral folding patterns and of local thickness of subarachnoid cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Our modelling shows that high electric fields occur primarily on the peaks of those gyri which have only a thin layer of CSF above them. These findings have important implications for inter-individual generalizability of the TMS-induced electric field. We propose that, in order to determine with accuracy the site of stimulation for an individual subject, it is necessary to solve the electric field distribution using subject-specific anatomy obtained from a high-resolution imaging modality such as MRI.	anatomic structures;cerebrospinal fluid;cervical atlas;coil device component;computation;computer simulation;cortical cell layer of the cerebellum;electroconvulsive therapy;electroencephalography;entity class - imaging modality;entity name part qualifier - adopted;finite element method;image resolution;map;modality (human–computer interaction);numerical analysis;tesla coil;thickness (graph theory);transcranial magnetic stimulation	Janine Diane Bijsterbosch;Anthony T.

We investigate several interpolation approaches to reduce the anisotropy and present a novel approach - constrained reverse diffusion for thick slice interpolation. This technique was compared to common methods: linear and cubic B-Spline interpolation and a technique based on non-rigid registration of neighboring slices. The methods were evaluated on artificial MR phantoms and real MR scans of human brain. The constrained reverse diffusion approach delivered promising results and provides an alternative for thick slice interpolation, especially for higher anisotropy factors.	anisotropy;b-spline;ct scan;cubic function;interpolation imputation technique;magnetic resonance imaging;muscle rigidity;phantoms, imaging;scanning;spline interpolation;voxel	Ales Neubert;Olivier Salvado;Oscar Acosta;Pierrick Bourgeat;Jurgen Fripp	2012	Computerized medical imaging and graphics : the official journal of the Computerized Medical Imaging Society	10.1016/j.compmedimag.2011.08.004	b-spline;computer vision;mathematical optimization;radiology;medicine;computer science;magnetic resonance imaging;mathematics;nuclear magnetic resonance;reverse diffusion;image scaling	Vision	45.31233508735433	-81.87059399827582	20837

With this feedback information, the clinician may decide to proceed with a computer-assisted intervention, revert to a manual intervention, or potentially provide information to the computer system to improve the registration. The paper focuses on total hip replacement (THR) surgery, but similar techniques could be applied to other types of interventions or therapy, including orthopedics, neurosurgery, and radiation therapy. Pre-operative CT data is used to plane the surgery (select an implant type, size and precise position), and is registered to intra-operative X-ray images, allowing to execute the plan: mill a cavity with the implant's shape. (Intra-operative X-ray images must be calibrated with respect to the surgical device executing the plan). One novel technique presented in this paper consists of simulating a post-operative X-ray image of the tissue of interest before doing the procedure, by projecting the registered implant onto an intra-operative X- ray image (corrected for distortion or not), providing clinicians with familiar and easy to interpret images. As an additional benefit, this method provides new means for comparing various strategies for registering pre-operative data to the physical space of the operating room.© (1999) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

The vertexes of the narrow blood vessels are projected onto the image-rendering plane. The grids aligned in the vessel direction are generated using the projected boundary vertexes on the image-rendering plane. The average computation time of the entire simulation is reduced by 80.17% compared to the simulation using the uniform grids. The results of the questionnaire survey show that the rendered X-ray images are realistic and useful to be applied to the angiography simulation.	alignment;blood vessel tissue;computation (action);diagnostic radiologic examination;projections and predictions;radiography;real-time clock;real-time transcription;regular grid;rendering (computer graphics);simulation;time complexity;x-ray (amazon kindle);angiogram	Jongbeom Lee;Myeongjin Kim;Doo Yong Lee	2018	2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513410	rendering (computer graphics);computer vision;angiography;computation;computer science;artificial intelligence;mesh generation	Robotics	39.58396600353792	-83.44318197187405	21302

The axial and lateral resolutions of the PS-OCT system are 9 and 6 μm, respectively. The main goal of this work is to build a high-resolution and minimally invasive optical imager for examining various kinds of cutaneous substructures with intrinsic or form birefringence. The internal structural information is extracted by the real-time signal analysis (Fourier Transform) of the modulated spectral intensity depending on the beam and tissue birefringence. The preliminary results using fresh beef longissimus muscle and in vivo Rattus norvegicus (rat) show that it is possible to visualize the birefringence effect of the tissue collagen fibers in the samples in order to achieve superior image contrast and sensitivity for the detection of hidden dermal structures. Compared to conventional CP-OCT, the proposed PS-OCT system provides depth-resolved images, which reflect the tissue birefringence.	birefringence;collagen fiber;extraction;hereditary angioedema type iii;image resolution;image sensor;imager device component;lateral thinking;longissimus;modulation;muscle;polarization (waves);rattus norvegicus;real-time clock;signal processing;tissue fiber;tomography;unix signal;video-in video-out	Jae-Ho Han;Jin U.

Hydrocephalus can raise intracranial pressure resulting in secondary brain damage, and up to 25% of patients with severely enlarged ventricles have epilepsy in later life. Ventricle enlargement is clinically monitored using 2D US through the fontanels. The sensitivity of 2D US to dilation is poor because it cannot provide accurate measurements of irregular volumes such as the ventricles, so most clinical evaluations are of a qualitative nature. We developed a 3D US system to image the cerebral ventricles of neonates within the confines of incubators that can be easily translated to more open environments. Ventricle volumes can be segmented from these images giving a quantitative volumetric measurement of ventricle enlargement without moving the patient into an imaging facility. In this paper, we report on in vivo validation studies: 1) comparing 3D US ventricle volumes before and after clinically necessary interventions removing CSF, and 2) comparing 3D US ventricle volumes to those from MRI. Post-intervention ventricle volumes were less than pre-intervention measurements for all patients and all interventions. We found high correlations (R = 0.97) between the difference in ventricle volume and the reported removed CSF with the slope not significantly different than 1 (p < 0.05). Comparisons between ventricle volumes from 3D US and MR images taken 4 (±3.8) days of each other did not show significant difference (p=0.44) between 3D US and MRI through paired t-test. © (2014) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

bb402c74bcf06857ffae37d7a7b1de5d42880185	markerless coil classification and localization in a routine mri examination setting using an rgb-d camera		In a routine MRI scan, a radio-frequency (RF) coil must be selected and placed around the region of interest (ROI). This is a crucial step in the workflow as the accurate coil placement is paramount for obtaining high-quality images. However, in the existing workflow, the position of the coil placement on the patient is estimated empirically by the medical technical assistant (MTA). This routine coil placement process has two shortcomings. On the one hand, the expertise of MTA in coil placement, taking the anatomical difference between patients into account, have a huge impact on the accuracy of the coil placement, and subsequently the image quality. On the other hand, the risk of selecting and placing the incorrect coil should be also be acknowledged. To improve the current workflow and provide feedback ahead of the MRI scans, we use an RGB-D camera to acquire extra information. Using the depth images taken before and after placing the coil, we propose a novel method to classify the coil type and localize the coil position during the coil placement process such that the MTA can place the coil correctly and accurately. We trained and evaluated our method over 100 synthetic data sets. We used two types of coils and placed and deformed them differently according to the anatomical region. The evaluation shows that we can classify the coil type without any error, and localize the coil with a mean translational error of 7.1 cm and mean rotation angle error of 0.025 rad.		Janani G.

642a236ff8c52ae23fa6fc400c2d3dc4ea636a97	a framework for informing segmentation of in vivo mri with information derived from ex vivo imaging: application in the medial temporal lobe	manuals;protocols;image segmentation;hippocampus;magnetic resonance imaging;in vivo	Automatic segmentation of cortical and subcortical structures is commonplace in brain MRI literature and is frequently used as the first step towards quantitative analysis of structural and functional neuroimaging. Most approaches to brain structure segmentation are based on propagation of anatomical information from example MRI datasets, called atlases or templates, that are manually labeled by experts. The accuracy of automatic segmentation is usually validated against the “bronze” standard of manual segmentation of test MRI datasets. However, good performance vis-a-vis manual segmentation does not imply accuracy relative to the underlying true anatomical boundaries. In the context of segmentation of hippocampal subfields and functionally related medial temporal lobe cortical subregions, we explore the challenges associated with validating existing automatic segmentation techniques against underlying histologically-derived anatomical “gold” standard; and, further, developing automatic in vivo MRI segmentation techniques informed by histological imaging.	acoustic lobing;atlases;brain;clinical use template;epilepsy, temporal lobe;functional neuroimaging;hippocampus (brain);medial graph;reporting;software propagation;tracer;video-in video-out;biologic segmentation	Paul A.

However, standard atlases, such as LPBA40, the Harvard-Oxford atlas, FreeSurfer, and the Jülich cytoarchitectonic maps all lack important detailed information about small subcortical structures like the substantia nigra and subthalamic nucleus. Here we introduce a new subcortical probabilistic atlas based on ultra-high resolution in-vivo anatomical imaging from 7 T MRI. The atlas includes six important but elusive subcortical nuclei: the striatum, the globus pallidus internal and external segment (GPi/e), the subthalamic nucleus, the substantia nigra, and the red nucleus. With a sample of 30 young subjects and carefully cross-validated delineation protocols, our atlas is able to capture the anatomical variability within healthy populations for each of the included structures at an unprecedented level of detail. All the generated probabilistic atlases are registered to MNI standard space and are publicly available.	anatomic structures;anatomy, regional;atlases;body space;cell nucleus;corpus striatum structure;freesurfer;globus pallidus;level of detail;magnetic resonance imaging;map;population;probabilistic database;protocols documentation;pyschological bonding;red nucleus structure;region of interest;registration;spatial variability;structure of subthalamic nucleus;substantia nigra structure;video-in video-out;algorithm;biologic segmentation	Max C.

bf000c26db2632eefc0e7e364037d0c530bf0333	a fast forward 3d connection algorithm for mitochondria and synapse segmentations from serial em images	3d connection;bwconncomp;em images;mitochondria;synapse	It is becoming increasingly clear that the quantification of mitochondria and synapses is of great significance to understand the function of biological nervous systems. Electron microscopy (EM), with the necessary resolution in three directions, is the only available imaging method to look closely into these issues. Therefore, estimating the number of mitochondria and synapses from the serial EM images is coming into prominence. Since previous studies have achieved preferable 2D segmentation performance, it holds great promise to obtain the 3D connection relationship from the 2D segmentation results. In this paper, we improve upon Matlab’s function bwconncomp and propose a fast forward 3D connection algorithm for mitochondria and synapse segmentations from serial EM images. To benchmark the performance of the proposed method, two EM datasets with the annotated ground truth are produced for mitochondria and synapses, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve the preferable connection performance that closely matches the ground truth. Moreover, it greatly reduces the computational burden and alleviates the memory requirements compared with the function bwconncomp. The proposed method can be deemed as an effective strategy to obtain the 3D connection relationship from serial mitochondria and synapse segmentations. It is helpful to accurately and quickly quantify the statistics of the numbers, volumes, surface areas, and lengths, which will greatly facilitate the data analysis of neurobiology research.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);computation;electron microscopy;estimated;fast forward;ground truth;matlab;nervous system structure;neurobiology;quantitation;requirement;synapse;biologic segmentation	Weifu Li;Jing Liu;Chi Xiao;Hao Deng;Qiwei Xie;Hua Han	2018		10.1186/s13040-018-0183-7		ML	46.6305874686487	-80.67340596040879	22087

The method enhances the mechanical stability of the fixation and reduces the intra-operative in-plane bending which might impede the functionality of the locking mechanism. The method is presented for the case of mandibular locking fixation plates, where the mandibular angle and the bone quality at screw locations are taken into account. Using computational anatomy techniques, the method automatically derives, from a set of computed tomography images, the mandibular angle and the bone thickness and intensity values at the path of every screw. An optimisation strategy is then used to optimise the two parameters of plate angle and screw position. Results for the new design are presented along with a comparison with a commercially available mandibular locking fixation plate. A statistically highly significant improvement was observed. Our experiments allowed us to conclude that an angle of 126 degrees and a screw separation of 8 mm is a more suitable design than the standard 120 degrees and 9 mm.	anatomic structures;bone tissue;ct scan;computational anatomy;computer case screws;decompression sickness;experiment;lock (computer science);mathematical morphology;mathematical optimization;thickness (graph theory);x-ray computed tomography	Habib Bousleiman;Christof Seiler;Tateyuki Iizuka;Lutz-Peter Nolte;Mauricio Reyes	2012	Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ...

Due to their timeand cost-intensive nature, these screenings to assess progress are unavailable to many. This paper introduces an automated, markerless, camerabased method for estimating rehabilitation criteria following ACL reconstruction. To evaluate the performance of this novel technique, data were collected weekly from 12 subjects as they used a leg press over the course of a 12-week rehabilitation period. The proposed camera-based method for estimating displacement and force was compared to encoder and force plate measurements. The leg press displacement and force values were estimated with 89.7% and 85.3% accuracy, respectively. These values were then used to calculate lower-limb symmetry and to track patient progress over time.	displacement mapping;encoder	Choong Hee Kim;Zhiming Xiao;Patrick D.

Thirty-five participants had unilateral breast cancer and 17 control subjects were assessed using infrared thermography. To evaluate reliability, two professionals, who were experienced, measured the temperature of the infrared images in two different moments, with a one-week interval. Biopsy was used as a gold standard exam with regard identify breast cancer. The analysis illustrated excellent reliability in terms of the affected, contralateral and control breasts with the intra-class correlation coefficient values ranging from 0.948 to 0.999. Standard measurement error ranged from 0.04 to 0.28 °C, and minimum detectable change deviated from 0.11 to 0.78 °C. Moreover, low to moderate accuracy were observed in terms of the establishment of the breast cancer diagnosis with values of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve ranging from 0.571 and 0.749. Breasts affected by cancer present higher skin temperature compared to contralateral and control. Furthermore, excellent reliability of the analysis of the infrared images and low-moderate accuracy in terms diagnosis were observed. Considering the results, infrared thermography can be applied as an instrument complement the assessment of breast cancer patients, but not for diagnostic purposes.	amendment;breast carcinoma;coefficient;complement system proteins;conflict (psychology);declaration (computer programming);helsinki declaration;image;infrared radiation therapy;mammary neoplasms;patients;receiver operating characteristic;receiver operator characteristics;skin temperature;spectroscopy, near-infrared;therapeutic procedure;cancer diagnosis;funding grant;infrared thermography;standards characteristics;thermography	Rinaldo Roberto de Jesus Guirro;Maíta Marade Oliveira Lima Leite Vaz;Lais Mara Siqueira das Neves;Almir Vieira Dibai-Filho;Hélio Humberto Angotti Carrara;Elaine Caldeira de Oliveira Guirro	2017	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-017-0730-7	medicine;pathology;gynecology;surgery	HCI	35.10747395928158	-81.85006009220943	22575
598402cb2cf6e7ab3a897a103f5b0c1369c493c6	automated t wave end detection methods - comparison of four different methods for t wave end detection		T wave end detection is essential for electrocardiogram (ECG) processing and analysis. Several methods have been proposed and tested, but an objective comparison is lacking. In this paper, four different (semi-) automated methods are compared with the manually annotated T wave ends of the PhysioNet QT database. The first method is a semi-automatic method, based on a template matching algorithm. The second method uses the tangent of the steepest point of the descending limb of the T wave. The third and fourth method perform a maximum area search of, respectively, a trapezium and the area under the curve. In order to evaluate the accuracy and repeatability of the proposed algorithms, the mean and standard deviation (sd) of the detection errors were computed. This was performed for leads I and II separately, after selection of the best annotated T wave end per beat and after selection of the best lead. We demonstrated that the trapezium method is the least repeatable of all methods tested (sd=29.7ms), whilst the integral method scores best in terms of accuracy (mean=2.2ms). These findings were strengthened by the analysis of the generated Bland-Altman plots, where the smallest bias was observed for the integral method (-1.89ms).	algorithm;bland's rule;deep brain stimulation;dynamical system;finite element method;national fund for scientific research;read-write memory;repeatability;risk assessment;semiconductor industry;standard widget toolkit;systemverilog;template matching;while	Jonathan Moeyersons;Griet Goovaerts;Suzy Huijghebaert;Bert Vandenberk;Rik Willems;Sabine Van Huffel	2017		10.5220/0006171700920098		Vision	32.63071555933442	-82.75727835673703	22827
6ac0af54c1f0600f4d53e065555018d2f350e027	irm de diffusion du q-space : acquisition et pré-traitements (q-space diffusion mri: acquisition and signal processing)		The overall goal of this thesis is to develop novel methods for the acquisition and the processing of diffusion magnetic resonance images (MRI), to provide new insights into the structure and anatomy of the brain white matter in vivo. Diffusion MRI is a non-invasive technique that measures locally the diffusion of water molecules. The latter are hindered by tissue structure, and therefore the characterization of water molecules displacement gives information on the nature, orientation, microstructure of the underlying tissue. Because of the strong anisotropy observed in white matter fiber tracts, this tool is most popular for the analysis of brain connectivity. One of the modality of acquisition and reconstruction, called diffusion tensor imaging, is now an established tool in research and clinical applications, for the detection of neural diseases and for pre-operative planning. Being model-based, the diffusion tensor cannot describe complex intra-voxel configurations, with multiple populations of fibers crossing. Since then, for a finer description of water molecules displacement, model-free approaches have recently been proposed, aiming at overcome the limitations of the diffusion tensor. Most of these techniques are still extremely demanding in acquisition time, and involve challenging reconstruction problems. The first part of this thesis proceeds from a description of the tissue microstructure, and a physical explanation of the origin of acquired diffusion signal. We give a review of the reconstruction methods and corresponding acquisition techniques in diffusion MRI. Several reconstruction methods are presented, and are categorized into model-based and model-free techniques. The first contribution of this thesis is related to the parametric reconstruction of the diffusion signal in a continuous basis of functions. We develop on a previous proposed method called Spherical Polar Fourier basis, and propose a continuous basis with a significant reduction of the dimension for the same power of description. We also derive the expression of the Laplace regularization operator in this basis, for a better robustness to noise. The second contribution is also related to the reconstruction of the diffusion signal, and the orientation distribution function, with a special focus on clinical setting. We propose a real-time reconstruction algorithm based on the Kalman filter to reconstruct the ODF in constant solid angle. We develop on top of the Kalman filter a motion detection algorithm, based on a monitoring and statistical analysis of the Kalman filter residuals. We are able to give a precise and sensitive motion detection, at no additional cost on the on-line acquisition system, as compared to systems based on camera and computer vision. The two last contributions are related to the acquisition methods in diffusion MRI, in particular for single and multiple q-shell experiments.

Surface reconstructions of the face have the potential to reveal a subject’s identity even when textual PHI is absent. This study assessed the ability of a computer application to match research subjects’ 3D facial reconstructions with conventional photographs of their face. In a prospective study, 29 subjects underwent CT scans of the head and had frontal digital photographs of their face taken. Facial reconstructions of each CT dataset were generated on a 3D workstation. In phase 1, photographs of the 29 subjects undergoing CT scans were added to a digital directory and tested for recognition using facial recognition software. In phases 2–4, additional photographs were added in groups of 50 to increase the pool of possible matches and the test for recognition was repeated. As an internal control, photographs of all subjects were tested for recognition against an identical photograph. Of 3D reconstructions, 27.5% were matched correctly to corresponding photographs (95% upper CL, 40.1%).

To achieve this goal, the Searchlight CT algorithm restricts the acquisition to X-rays passing mainly through the region of interest. The algorithm uses an iteration of the X-ray transform and of a regularized inverse, which converges rapidly and for which generic conditions of converges are provided. The performance of the Searchlight CT algorithm is illustrated on both phantom and experimental data.

Also, the mechanical properties of the cornea can be used to evaluate the recovery from corneal refractive surgeries. Therefore, noninvasive and high-resolution estimation of the stiffness distribution in the cornea is important in ophthalmic diagnosis. The present study established a method for high-resolution acoustic-radiation-force-impulse (ARFI) imaging based on a dual-frequency confocal transducer in order to obtain a relative stiffness map, which was used to assess corneal sclerosis. An 11-MHz pushing element was used to induce localized displacements of tissue, which were monitored by a 48-MHz imaging element. Since the tissue displacements are directly correlated with the tissue elastic properties, the stiffness distribution in a tiny region of the cornea can be found by a mechanical B/D scan. The experimental system was verified using tissue-mimicking phantoms that included different geometric structures. Ex vivo cornea experiments were carried out using fresh porcine eyeballs. Corneas with localized sclerosis were created artificially by the injection of a formalin solution. The phantom experiments showed that the distributions of stiffness within different phantoms can be recognized clearly using ARFI imaging, and the measured lateral and axial resolutions of this imaging system were 177 and 153 μm, respectively. The ex vivo experimental results from ARFI imaging showed that a tiny region of localized sclerosis in the cornea could be distinguished. All of the obtained results demonstrate that high-resolution ARFI imaging has considerable potential for the clinical diagnosis of corneal sclerosis.	acoustic cryptanalysis;cornea;corneal diseases;diagnosis, clinical;dual;experiment;experimental system;eye;formalin;gastroenteritis, transmissible, of swine;image resolution;keratoconus;lateral thinking;magnetic resonance imaging;multiple sclerosis;ophthalmology specialty;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;radiation pneumonitis;sensor;stiffness;stroma;surgical ocular refractive procedure;transducer;ultraviolet rays;video-in video-out	Cho-Chiang Shih;Chih-Chung Huang;Qifa Zhou;K.

In this paper, an approach is proposed to increase image resolution of parallel magnetic resonance imaging. Since different receiver coils have different sensitivity profiles, different receiver channel models are constructed to map the original image information to low resolution images of different channels. Based on these models, the degradation function of every low resolution image can be obtained to compute the high resolution image iteratively using the well known super resolution approach. An in-vivo experiment is also provided to illustrate the feasibility and robustness of the proposed approach.	elegant degradation;image resolution;iterative reconstruction;resonance;super-resolution imaging;video-in video-out;whole earth 'lectronic link	Yanhong Lu;Ran Yang;Jingxin Zhang;Cishen Zhang	2010	IEEE ICCA 2010	10.1109/ICCA.2010.5524456	computer vision;image resolution;computer science;magnetic resonance imaging;nuclear magnetic resonance;sub-pixel resolution;medical physics	Vision	47.762839039288764	-82.77639157917227	23370
68164c598249428db64e6e09ecc04b39ce1134bb	a guideline for head volume conductor modeling in eeg and meg	fem;volume conductor modeling;forward problem;meg;eeg;tissue conductivity anisotropy	For accurate EEG/MEG source analysis it is necessary to model the head volume conductor as realistic as possible. This includes the distinction of the different conductive compartments in the human head. In this study, we investigated the influence of modeling/not modeling the conductive compartments skull spongiosa, skull compacta, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), gray matter, and white matter and of the inclusion of white matter anisotropy on the EEG/MEG forward solution. Therefore, we created a highly realistic 6-compartment head model with white matter anisotropy and used a state-of-the-art finite element approach. Starting from a 3-compartment scenario (skin, skull, and brain), we subsequently refined our head model by distinguishing one further of the above-mentioned compartments. For each of the generated five head models, we measured the effect on the signal topography and signal magnitude both in relation to a highly resolved reference model and to the model generated in the previous refinement step. We evaluated the results of these simulations using a variety of visualization methods, allowing us to gain a general overview of effect strength, of the most important source parameters triggering these effects, and of the most affected brain regions. Thereby, starting from the 3-compartment approach, we identified the most important additional refinement steps in head volume conductor modeling. We were able to show that the inclusion of the highly conductive CSF compartment, whose conductivity value is well known, has the strongest influence on both signal topography and magnitude in both modalities. We found the effect of gray/white matter distinction to be nearly as big as that of the CSF inclusion, and for both of these steps we identified a clear pattern in the spatial distribution of effects. In comparison to these two steps, the introduction of white matter anisotropy led to a clearly weaker, but still strong, effect. Finally, the distinction between skull spongiosa and compacta caused the weakest effects in both modalities when using an optimized conductivity value for the homogenized compartment. We conclude that it is highly recommendable to include the CSF and distinguish between gray and white matter in head volume conductor modeling. Especially for the MEG, the modeling of skull spongiosa and compacta might be neglected due to the weak effects; the simplification of not modeling white matter anisotropy is admissible considering the complexity and current limitations of the underlying modeling approach.	anatomical compartments;anisotropy;assumed;calibration;cerebrospinal fluid;compacta;diffusion tensor imaging;electroencephalography;emoticon;finite element method;gray matter;image scaling;imagery;magnetoencephalography;multi-compartment model;numerical analysis;propylene glycol;reference model;refinement (computing);simulation;skull fracture, basilar;small;text simplification;the superficial;topography;white matter;physiologic resolution	Johannes Vorwerk;Jae-Hyun Cho;Stefan Rampp;Hajo Hamer;Thomas R.

The navigation system takes advantage of recorded image data, including the preoperatively computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance tomography (MRT) data, which are registered and segmented in order to obtain relevant biological markers, as well as the intraoperative camera data. A device for absolute positioning, included in the laparoscope and consisting of an acoustic indoor localization with a supporting inertial measurement unit (IMU), fuses these different navigation data for reliable 6 degree-of-freedom (DOF) position and orientation estimation. With those navigation information of the laparoscope, the landmarks of the preoperative data are localized on the intraoperative camera images via augmented reality and thus the site of the relevant features (e. g., a carcinoma) is determined.	acoustic cryptanalysis;augmented reality;ct scan;reduced cost;resonance;tomography	Philipp Rapp;Oliver Sawodny;Cristina Tarín;C.

Our method is composed of four steps. First, we segment the background of PET and CT brain images using 3D seeded region growing and apply inverse operation to the segmented images for getting head without holes. The non-head regions segmented with the head are then removed using the region growing-based labeling and the sharpening filter is applied to the segmented head in order to extract the feature points of the head from PET and CT images, respectively. Second, a GWDM is generated from feature points of CT images to lead the feature points extracted from PET images with large blurry and noisy conditions to robustly align at optimal location onto CT images. Third, similarity measure is evaluated repeatedly by weighted cross-correlation (WCC). In our experiments, we evaluate our method using software phantom and clinical datasets with the aspect of visual inspection, accuracy, robustness, and computational time. In our method, RMSE for translations and rotations are less than 0.1mm and 0.2o, respectively in software phantom dataset and give better accuracy than the conventional ones. In addition, our method gives a robust registration at optimal location regardless of increasing noise level.© (2006) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

Consider, for instance, the development and refinement of laparoscopic surgery. In this type of surgery, abdominal operations such as hepatic (liver) resections are accomplished through small incisions. The abdomen of the patient is inflated with gas to create open space inside and a video camera is inserted into the abdomen through one of the small incisions. The video image is magnified and transmitted to a high-resolution monitor, allowing the surgeon to see the abdominal anatomy with great clarity. The surgery is performed using special instruments introduced through the other incisions. The advantages of surgical simulation for the patient include less pain and less strain for the body, faster recovery, and reduced overall illness time. The surgeon, however, must acquire specific skills and develop advanced hand-eye coordination before attempting to perform such a procedure in a real-world setting.	image resolution;refinement (computing);simulation	Hervé Delingette;Nicholas Ayache	2005	Commun.

A statistical model parameterized on a Beta distribution was built upon the observations of the volume overlap between the segmented structure and the referenced structure. A statistical performance profile (SPP) was then estimated from the model using the generalized maximum likelihood approach. The SPP defines the probability density function characterizing the distribution of performance values and provides a graphical visualization of the segmentation performance. Different segmentation approaches may be influenced by image quality or observer variability. Our statistical model was able to quantify the impact of these variations and displays the underlying statistical performance of the segmentation algorithm. We demonstrated the efficacy of this statistical model using both simulated data and clinical evaluation studies in head and neck radiotherapy. Furthermore, the resulting SPP facilitates the measurement of the correlation between quantitative metrics and clinical experts' decision, and ultimately is able to guide the clinicians in selecting segmentation methods for radiotherapy.	body dysmorphic disorders;head and neck structure;image quality;imagery;inter-rater reliability;self-propelled particles;spatial variability;statistical model;algorithm;beta thalassemia;biologic segmentation	Jinzhong Yang;Chuanming Wei;Lifei Zhang;Yongbin Zhang;Rick S.

Our method is composed of four stages. First, the lungs are extracted from chest CT scans by the automatic segmentation method. Second, the gross translational mismatch is corrected by the optimal cube registration. This initial registration does not require extracting any anatomical landmarks. Third, initial alignment is step by step refined by the iterative surface registration. To evaluate the distance measure between surface boundary points, a 3D distance map is generated by the narrow-band distance propagation, which drives fast and robust convergence to the optimal location. Fourth, nodule correspondences are established by the pairs with the smallest Euclidean distances. The results of pulmonary nodule alignment of twenty patients are reported on a per-center-of mass point basis using the average Euclidean distance (AED) error between corresponding nodules of initial and follow-up scans. The average AED error of twenty patients is significantly reduced to 4.7mm from 30.0mm by our registration. Experimental results show that our registration method aligns the lung nodules much faster than the conventional ones using a distance measure. Accurate and fast result of our method would be more useful for the radiologist's evaluation of pulmonary nodules on chest CT scans.© (2006) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

5dca8f9fb2bd5420232a21cea4d96d9b4eb4aadb	liver motion estimation via locally adaptive over-segmentation regularization		Despite significant advances in the development of deformable registration methods, motion correction of deformable organs such as the liver remain a challenging task. This is due to not only low contrast in liver imaging, but also due to the particularly complex motion between scans primarily owing to patient breathing. In this paper, we address ab- dominal motion estimation using a novel regularization model that is ad- vancing the state-of-the-art in liver registration in terms of accuracy. We propose a novel regularization of the deformation field based on spatially adaptive over-segmentation, to better model the physiological motion of the abdomen. Our quantitative analysis of abdominal Computed Tomog- raphy and dynamic contrast-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans show a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art Demons approaches. This work also demonstrates the feasibility of segmentation- free registration between clinical scans that can inherently preserve sliding motion at the lung and liver boundary interfaces.	matrix regularization;motion estimation	Bartlomiej W.

The primary premises of elastography are that speckle kinematics reproduces underlying tissue kinematics and that tissue motion can be inferred from speckle tracking. This implicitly assumes that speckle pattern is a material property that can be tracked with respect to time and space. It is then convenient to express the motion of such a material property in terms of total derivative, also known as optical flow (OF) equations. The present paper introduces a new iterative OF-based elastography (OFBE) method devoted to B-mode data. The first OFBE iteration computes axial and lateral displacement fields. Such displacement fields are used for data rigid registration, prior to the second OFBE iteration which computes the 2-D strain tensor. The OFBE method was validated in the common carotid artery of rat hypertension models. The effect of aging on carotid stiffness was investigated in female recombinant inbred rats (RI-17, (n = 2)) in the first experiment. The outcomes of low/high-salt diets were examined in young male Dahl salt-sensitive rats (SS, n = 6; SM12, n = 6; SM9, n = 6) in the second experiment. Good concordance was observed between left and right carotid axial strain measurements with 11.4% relative error, whereas 4.6% relative error occurred between diastolic and systolic axial strain measurements. Old (80 and 85 weeks) RI-17 carotids were determined to be twice as stiff with 5.70 ± 0.97% (strain ± std) as young carotids (30 and 34 weeks) with 13.26 ± 2.73%, p < 0.001. Carotid axial strain measurement also indicated that salt diets had a significant impact on SS (p=0.008) and SM12 (p < 0.001) but not on SM9 (p = 0.881) rats.	approximation error;carotid arteries;carotid artery diseases;concordance (publishing);diastole;displacement mapping;eighty;elastography;estimated;hypertensive disease;inference;inverse kinematics;iteration;iterative method;lateral thinking;muscle rigidity;optical flow;psychologic displacement;recombinant dna;recombinants;sbp;slit lamp biomicroscope (physical object);stiffness matrix;the current;ultrasonics (sound);vascular calcification;torr	Toufik Zakaria;Zhao Qin;Roch L.

To address the lack of such a gold standard, simulated diffusion tensor data sets are developed, which can model an array of anomalies in the diffusion properties of a predefined location. These data sets can be employed to evaluate the numerous parameters that characterize the pipeline of a VBA algorithm and to compare the accuracy, precision, and reproducibility of different post-processing approaches quantitatively. We are convinced that the use of these simulated data sets can improve the understanding of how different diffusion tensor image post-processing techniques affect the outcome of VBA. In turn, this may possibly lead to a more standardized and reliable evaluation of diffusion tensor data sets of large study groups with a wide range of white matter altering pathologies. The simulated DTI data sets will be made available online (http://www.dti.ua.ac.be).	algorithm;diffusion tensor imaging;ground truth;image registration;pipeline (computing);population parameter;smoothing (statistical technique);video post-processing;visual basic for applications;voxel;white matter;width	Wim Van Hecke;Jan Sijbers;Steve De Backer;Dirk H.

We compared seven different interactive annotation strategies using different combinations of both types of training data, in order to minimize user effort in the interactive annotation process. The lungs in all scans were divided into roughly spherical volumes of interest (VOIs). An observer labeled all VOIs in 21 thoracic CT scans. Leave-one-scan-out experiments that simulated slice-by-slice interactive annotation sessions were performed. The best results were obtained with a strategy in which the simulated user decides for each slice whether to use a classifier trained on pooled data from prior scans or a classifier trained on data from the current scan. In this approach, the labels of 88% of all VOIs were predicted correctly, meaning that only 12% of all labels needed to be changed by the simulated user.	ct scan;experiment;interactivity;interstitial webpage;simulation;statistical classification	Thessa T.

This makes it necessary to incorporate a priori knowledge in order to select a particular solution. A computational challenge for some subject-specific head models is that many inverse algorithms require a comprehensive sampling of the candidate source space at the desired resolution. In this study, we present an algorithm that can accurately reconstruct details of localized source activity from a sparse sampling of the candidate source space. Forward computations are minimized through an adaptive procedure that increases source resolution as the spatial extent is reduced. With this algorithm, we were able to compute inverses using only 6% to 11% of the full resolution lead-field, with a localization accuracy that was not significantly different than an exhaustive search through a fully-sampled source space. The technique is, therefore, applicable for use with anatomically-realistic, subject-specific forward models for applications with spatially concentrated source activity.	adaptive algorithm;brute-force search;computation;concentrate dosage form;finite element method;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;solutions;sparse matrix;well-posed problem	Paul H.

Erroneous or ambiguous ground truth annotations, numerous evaluation protocols, and the lack of standardized benchmarks make a direct quantitative comparison of different tracking approaches rather difficult. The goal of this paper is to raise awareness of common pitfalls related to objective ground truth evaluation. We investigate the influence of different annotations, evaluation software, and training procedures using several publicly available resources, and point out the limitations of current definitions of evaluation metrics. Finally, we argue that the development an extensive standardized benchmark for multi-target tracking is an essential step toward more objective comparison of tracking approaches.	benchmark (computing);evaluation function;ground truth;microsoft outlook for mac	Anton Milan;Konrad Schindler;Stefan Roth	2013	2013 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops	10.1109/CVPRW.2013.111	computer vision;simulation;ground truth;computer science;evaluation;video tracking;data mining	Vision	44.68870196899458	-89.01301800358405	25147

The cross-correlation algorithm was optimized to compute red blood cell velocity profiles in tube flow. Flow rates, estimated by computing the circular integral of mean velocity profiles, were compared with calibrated pump flows for different focus planes of the microscope and different flow rates. Results show a mean flow underestimation of 2.8 plusmn 5% for all positions of the focus plane inside the tube diameter, highlighting the non-negligible DOC effect when CC is applied to study blood microcirculation. An underestimation of 1% was found with an optimal focus plane. To conclude, flow rate estimation in microcirculatory blood flow can be accurate if the DOC effect is properly compensated for by the CC flow estimation method.	algorithm;cross-correlation;microsoft word for mac;velocity (software development)	Boris Chayer;Jacques A. de Guise;Guy Cloutier	2008	2008 5th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro	10.1109/ISBI.2008.4541257	medicine;pathology;blood flow;cross-correlation;nanotechnology;intravital microscopy;volumetric flow rate;bio-mems	Embedded	28.27409725217725	-84.34689968303998	25223

Two models of DeBakey type I aortic dissection, which involves the entire aorta, were analyzed. Patient-specific geometries were reconstructed, based on Computed tomography (CT) scan images, in order to obtain 3D finite element meshes. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD), which uses numeric methods and algorithms for the simulation of blood flow by solving the Navier-Stokes equations on computational meshes, enhances the understanding of disease progression. For that purpose, the major fluid dynamic parameters and indicators of disease progression, such as velocity field, pressure and shear stress, were computed and analyzed. The computed results showed higher velocities in the ascending aorta, the inlet and outlet tears and the iliac arteries, in case of both models. The pressure distribution showed high zones in the ascending aorta, while the shear stress distribution showed low zones in the aneurysm part, in case of both models. In summary, the presented study can be extended to a larger patient group in a longitudinal study with the goal to determine the potential value of CFD simulations in prediction of aneurysmal growth and rupture.	algorithm;ct scan;color gradient;computation;computational fluid dynamics;finite element method;navier–stokes equations;simulation;steam rupture;tomography;velocity (software development)	Smiljana Djorovic;Nenad Filipovic;Vladislava Stojic;Lazar U.

Simulated stimulation fields are often defined and visualized by electric held isolevels or volumes of tissue activated (VTA). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between stimulation held strength as defined by the electric potential V, the electric held E, and the divergence of the electric held ∇<sup>2</sup>V, and neural activation. Axon cable models were developed and coupled to finite-element DBS models in three-dimensional (3-D). Field thresholds (V<sub>T</sub>, E<sub>T</sub>, and ∇<sup>2</sup> V<sub>T</sub>) were derived at the location of activation for various stimulation amplitudes (1 to 5 V), pulse widths (30 to 120 μs), and axon diameters (2.0 to 7.5 μm). Results showed that thresholds for V<sub>T</sub> and ∇<sup>2</sup> V<sub>T</sub> were highly dependent on the stimulation amplitude while E<sub>T</sub> were approximately independent of the amplitude for large axons. The activation held strength thresholds presented in this study may be used in future studies to approximate the VTA during model-based investigations of DBS without the need of computational axon models.	approximation algorithm;axon;computation;deep brain stimulation;diameter (qualifier value);direct-broadcast satellite;electroconvulsive therapy;futures studies;simulation;ventral tegmental area	Mattias Åström;Elin Diczfalusy;Hubert C.

d579225c300f098bba04b5573af7f61ca4c228a4	buttock dummy consisting of force sensors and soft material for the validation of deep tissue injury risk		Wheelchair users, such as individuals with spinal cord injuries and the elderly, have a high risk of pressure ulcer formation due to many hours a day spent sitting. To prevent pressure ulcer formation, its risk needs to be quantified. In cases of deep tissue injury (DTI), it is difficult to predict where tissue breakdown will occur as it is initiated from the tissues under the skin. Therefore, the aim of this study is to develop a human buttock dummy with force sensors and soft material to evaluate the risk of DTI due to the surface of seat. To choose the soft material of the buttock dummy, the elasticity of the human buttock tissue was measured. The proposed buttock dummy consists of rigid simulated pelvis model and simulated soft tissue made from silicone rubber. To evaluate the developed buttock dummy, the pressure force distribution of the buttock dummy was measured and compared with the sitting human, we confirmed that the buttock dummy is similar to the features of the human buttock.	c object processor;dummy variable (statistics);elasticity (cloud computing);elasticity (data store);graph toughness;known-plaintext attack;modulus robot;pattern recognition;sensor;simulation;under the skin	Kunihiro Ogata;Kohei Kanaya;Tsuyoshi Nakayama;Mitsuo Umezu;Eiichi Ono	2017	2017 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII)	10.1109/SII.2017.8279341	engineering;biomedical engineering;artificial intelligence;computer vision;buttocks;soft tissue;pelvis;wheelchair;tissue breakdown;sitting	Robotics	28.102825540863044	-86.79009240553852	25715

The heat sinks effects may be mitigated by, among others, control of the external temperature during the heating. For these procedures temporal characterization becomes crucial. We propose transient finite-element analysis (FEA) simulations as a reliable method of modeling the temporal behavior at different external temperatures. Heating curves obtained in measurements of ultrasonic heating in a brain phantom are modeled using the simulations. On achieving good agreement between the simulation and experimental results, we proceeded with the simulation of heating in a complex head model. Heating efficacy is described in terms of extent and volume of thermal dose. The extent and the volume increased by 40% to 100% for the temperatures of 18 to 47 degC.

However, the PET data need to be previously corrected for the physical image degrading effects. In this work, we demonstrate the effect of detector scatter on image quality in small animal imaging as measured with individual crystals. PET scanners. The detector scatter is shown to affect the spatial resolution and the partial volume. Its effect on object scalier correction is also discussed. The spatial resolution was found to increase about 4% after restoration of detector scatter as assessed in the projections of the sinograms. The gain in amplitude of a small size measured structure corresponding to this ratio should be considered to subsequently accurately correct for partial volume effect.	circuit restoration;electron tomography;image quality;polyethylene terephthalate;preclinical imaging;video-in video-out	Otman Sarrhini;Simon-Alexandre Lhussier;M'hamed Bentourkia	2004	2004 2nd IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: Nano to Macro (IEEE Cat No. 04EX821)		computer vision;radiology;image resolution;pet-ct;computer science;nuclear medicine;partial volume;medical physics	Visualization	46.97150112037863	-84.35548882566641	25906

However, no studies have examined the histological accuracy of subfield segmentation protocols. The presence of MRI-visible anatomical landmarks with known correspondence to histology represents a fundamental prerequisite for in vivo hippocampal subfield segmentation. In the present study, we aimed to: 1) develop a novel method for hippocampal body segmentation, based on two MRI-visible anatomical landmarks (stratum lacunosum moleculare [SLM] & dentate gyrus [DG]), and assess its accuracy in comparison to the gold standard direct histological measurements; 2) quantify the accuracy of two published segmentation strategies in comparison to the histological gold standard; and 3) apply the novel method to ex vivo MRI and correlate the results with histology.   METHODS Ultra-high resolution ex vivo MRI was performed on six whole cadaveric hippocampal specimens, which were then divided into 22 blocks and histologically processed. The hippocampal bodies were segmented into subfields based on histological criteria and subfield boundaries and areas were directly measured. A novel method was developed using mean percentage of the total SLM distance to define subfield boundaries. Boundary distances and subfield areas on histology were then determined using the novel method and compared to the gold standard histological measurements. The novel method was then used to determine ex vivo MRI measures of subfield boundaries and areas, which were compared to histological measurements.   RESULTS For direct histological measurements, the mean percentages of total SLM distance were: Subiculum/CA1 = 9.7%, CA1/CA2 = 78.4%, CA2/CA3 = 97.5%. When applied to histology, the novel method provided accurate measures for CA1/CA2 (ICC = 0.93) and CA2/CA3 (ICC = 0.97) boundaries, but not for the Subiculum/CA1 (ICC = -0.04) boundary. Accuracy was poorer using previous techniques for CA1/CA2 (maximum ICC = 0.85) and CA2/CA3 (maximum ICC = 0.88), with the previously reported techniques also performing poorly in defining the Subiculum/CA1 boundary (maximum ICC = 0.00). Ex vivo MRI measurements using the novel method were linearly related to direct measurements of SLM length (r2 = 0.58), CA1/CA2 boundary (r2 = 0.39) and CA2/CA3 boundary (r2 = 0.47), but not for Subiculum/CA1 boundary (r2 = 0.01). Subfield areas measured with the novel method on histology and ex vivo MRI were linearly related to gold standard histological measures for CA1, CA2, and CA3/CA4/DG.   CONCLUSIONS In this initial proof of concept study, we used ex vivo MRI and histology of cadaveric hippocampi to develop a novel segmentation protocol for the hippocampal body. The novel method utilized two anatomical landmarks, SLM & DG, and provided accurate measurements of CA1, CA2, and CA3/CA4/DG subfields in comparison to the gold standard histological measurements. The relationships demonstrated between histology and ex vivo MRI supports the potential feasibility of applying this method to in vivo MRI studies.	ca1 field;ca3 stratum lucidum;discontinuous galerkin method;distance;hippocampal replay;itil;magnetic resonance imaging;protocols documentation;scientific publication;sirolimus;spatial light modulator;specimen;structure of dentate gyrus;video-in video-out;biologic segmentation;decigram	Trevor A.

While a number of imaging modalities can provide complementary information about the tumor composition, there are several constraints regarding radiation, cost and patient tolerance that dictate the need of non-invasive and cost-effective methods to be used for tumor imaging in the context of personalized medicine. In this paper we present some of the major challenges in imaging tumor environment using perfusion and diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) based on the actual computational workflows and discuss important computational issues that affect the robustness, reproducibility as well as the clinical significance of the extracted clinical biomarkers.	computation;personalization;resonance	Kostas Marias;Katerina Nikiforaki;Georgios C.

In this paper, we suggest two new methods to handle lateral truncation in helical scan CT. It is seen that reconstruction with laterally truncated projection data, assuming it to be complete, gives severe artifacts which even penetrates into the field of view. A row-by-row data completion approach using linear prediction is introduced for helical scan truncated data. An extension of this technique known as windowed linear prediction approach is introduced. Efficacy of the two techniques are shown using simulation with standard phantoms. A quantitative image quality measure of the resulting reconstructed images are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods against an extension of a standard existing technique.		K. P.

The method relies on selection of events (i.e. detected coincidences) corresponding to the respiratory state in breath-hold X-ray computed tomography (CT) from respiratory-gated List Mode (LM) acquisitions. The low counting statistics in this method prompted an assessment of the tradeoff between the bias in standard imaging with motion and the increased variance associated with only using counts from a single phase of the respiratory cycle. The influence of AW-OSEM parameters (the number of iterations and the 3D Gaussian postfilter settings) was also optimized to suit the low counting statistics. Our results show that the parameter-optimized CT-based method reduces bias to 37.3%, compared with 70.7% for standard images with motion.	active worlds;adjusted winner procedure;ct scan;iteration;mathematical optimization;polyethylene terephthalate;tomography	Joël Daouk;Loïc Fin;Pascal Bailly;Marc-Etienne Meyer	2008	2008 5th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro	10.1109/ISBI.2008.4541248	iterative reconstruction;radiology;gaussian process;mathematics;nuclear medicine;physics;statistics;medical physics	Vision	49.24546238635854	-83.77530740842516	26302
e62ed064879f9e6c9dd11035764c2763b94bc526	pop: preoperative planning and simulation software for total hip replacement surgery	total hip replacement;simulation software;dislocations	  Proper implant placement during total hip replacement (THR) surgery has been shown to reduce short and long term complication  including dislocations, accelerated wear, and loosening of the implants. Correct implant orientation is the most important  factor in preventing impingement, which is a major cause of dislocation and wear following total hip replacement surgery.  However, proper implant orientation is also dependent upon patient-specific factors such as pelvic anatomy bone coverage and  level of femoral osteotomy, and can affect leg lengths and offsets. This paper describes a preoperative planner for THR that  enables the surgeon to determine the optimal placement of the femoral and acetabular components for THR taking all of these  factors into account. Coupled with a computer-assisted clinical system for precise implant positioning, this approach could  significantly improve patient outcomes and lower costs.

b65a8a12d1029a55e207b449a994d4ecde4efff1	a medical software system for volumetric analysis of cerebral pathologies in magnetic resonance imaging (mri) data		In this contribution, a medical software system for volumetric analysis of different cerebral pathologies in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data is presented. The software system is based on a semi-automatic segmentation algorithm and helps to overcome the time-consuming process of volume determination during monitoring of a patient. After imaging, the parameter settings—including a seed point—are set up in the system and an automatic segmentation is performed by a novel graph-based approach. Manually reviewing the result leads to reseeding, adding seed points or an automatic surface mesh generation. The mesh is saved for monitoring the patient and for comparisons with follow-up scans. Based on the mesh, the system performs a voxelization and volume calculation, which leads to diagnosis and therefore further treatment decisions. The overall system has been tested with different cerebral pathologies—glioblastoma multiforme, pituitary adenomas and cerebral aneurysms– and evaluated against manual expert segmentations using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). Additionally, intra-physician segmentations have been performed to provide a quality measure for the presented system.	cerebral infarction;coefficient;glioblastoma;magnetic resonance imaging;mesh generation;patients;pituitary adenoma;population parameter;preparation;review [publication type];semiconductor industry;software system;algorithm	Jan Egger;Christoph Kappus;Bernd Freisleben;Christopher Nimsky	2011	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-011-9673-6	computer vision;pathology;computer science	Visualization	38.681933061957366	-80.42178165081836	26475
41280536cf68956b51cc659914d1b30e6aad7c3d	software pipeline for midsagittal corpus callosum thickness profile processing		This paper presents a fully automated pipeline for thickness profile evaluation and analysis of the human corpus callosum (CC) in 3D structural T 1-weighted magnetic resonance images. The pipeline performs the following sequence of steps: midsagittal plane extraction, CC segmentation algorithm, quality control tool, thickness profile generation, statistical analysis and results figure generator. The CC segmentation algorithm is a novel technique that is based on a template-based initialisation with refinement using mathematical morphology operations. The algorithm is demonstrated to have high segmentation accuracy when compared to manual segmentations on two large, publicly available datasets. Additionally, the resultant thickness profiles generated from the automated segmentations are shown to be highly correlated to those generated from the ground truth segmentations. The manual editing tool provides a user-friendly environment for correction of errors and quality control. Statistical analysis and a novel figure generator are provided to facilitate group-wise morphological analysis of the CC.	algorithm;body of uterus;clinical use template;corpus callosum agenesis neuronopathy;ground truth;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;mathematical morphology;mathematics;pipeline (software);portable document format;refinement (computing);resonance;resultant;scicrunch;shape analysis (digital geometry);statistical shape analysis;thickness (graph theory);uniform resource locator;usability;web site;biologic segmentation	Christopher L.

4c214b2308d510fc67be8fe52d14b298ea47af31	4-d intracardiac ultrasound vector flow imaging–feasibility and comparison to phase-contrast mri		"""In vivo characterization of intracardiac blood velocity vector fields may provide new clinical information but is currently not available for bedside evaluation. In this paper, 4-D vector flow imaging for intracardiac flow assessment is demonstrated using a clinical ultrasound (US) system and a matrix array transducer, without the use of contrast agent. Two acquisition schemes were developed, one for full volumetric coverage of the left ventricle (LA) at 50 vps and a 3-D thick-slice setup with continuous frame acquisition (4000 vps), both utilizing ECG-gating. The 3-D vector velocity estimates were obtained using a novel method combining phase and envelope information. In vitro validation in a rotating tissue-mimicking phantom revealed velocity estimates in compliance with the ground truth, with a linear regression slope of 0.80, 0.77, and 1.03 for the <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">${x}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">${y}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">${z}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> velocity components, and with standard deviations of 2.53, 3.19, and 0.95 cm/s, respectively. In vivo measurements in a healthy LV showed good agreement with PC-MRI. Quantitative analysis of energy loss (EL) and kinetic energy (KE) further showed similar trends, with peak KE at 1.5 and 2.4 mJ during systole and 3.6 and 3.1 mJ for diastole for US and PC-MRI. Similar for EL, 0.15– 0.2 and 0.7 mW was found during systole and 0.6 and 0.7 mW during diastole, for US and PC-MRI, respectively. Overall, a potential for US as a future modality for 4D cardiac vector flow imaging was demonstrated, which will be further evaluated in clinical studies."""

Here, the authors propose a wavelet-based multiresolution analysis method for metal artifact reduction, in which information is extracted from corrupted projection data. The wavelet method improves image quality by a successive interpolation in the wavelet domain. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the metal artifacts due to both photon starving and beam hardening can be effectively suppressed using the authors' method. As compared to the filtered back-projection after linear interpolation, the wavelet-based reconstruction is significantly more accurate for depiction of anatomical structures, especially in the immediate neighborhood of the prostheses. This superior imaging precision is highly advantageous in geometric modeling for fitting hip prostheses."""	analysis method;anatomic structures;ct scan;diagnostic radiologic examination;extraction;geometric modeling;hip joint implantable prostheses (device);image quality;interpolation imputation technique;iterative reconstruction;iterative method;joint prosthesis (device);linear function;linear interpolation;morphologic artifacts;multiresolution analysis;photons;radiation;rendering (computer graphics);scientific publication;waist–hip ratio;wavelet;x-ray computed tomography	Shiying Zhao;Douglas D.

However, so far it still remains a big challenge to identify the fine structures of the smallest capillary vessel networks via conventional imaging ways. Here, the room temperature liquid metal angiography was proposed for the first time to generate mega contrast X-ray images for multiscale vasculature mapping. Particularly, gallium was adopted as the room temperature liquid metal contrast agent and infused into the vessels of in vitro pig hearts and kidneys. We scanned the samples under X-ray and compared the angiograms with those obtained via conventional contrast agent-the iohexol. As quantitatively demonstrated by the grayscale histograms and numerical indexes, the contrast of the vessels to the surrounding tissues in the liquid metal angiograms is orders higher than that of the iohexol enhanced images. And the angiogram has reached detailed enough width of 0.1 mm for the tiny vessels, which indicated that the capillaries can be clearly distinguished under the liquid metal enhanced images. Further, with tomography from the micro-CT, we also managed to reconstruct the 3-D structures of the kidney vessels. Tremendous clarity and efficiency of the method over existing approaches have been experimentally clarified. It was disclosed that the usually invisible capillary networks now become distinctively clear in the gallium angiograms. This basic mechanism has generalized purpose and can be extended to a wide spectrum of 3-D computational tomographic areas. It opens a new soft tool for quickly reconstructing high-resolution spatial channel networks for scientific researches as well as engineering practices where complicated and time-consuming resections are no longer a necessity.	anatomic structures;blood vessel tissue;blood capillaries;blood supply aspects;body tissue;capillary vessel;clarify;clarity measurement;computation;computational anatomy;contrast media;diagnostic radiologic examination;entity name part qualifier - adopted;experiment;gallium;grayscale color map;image resolution;index;iohexol;iterative reconstruction;kidney;macaca nemestrina;melting point;numerical analysis;renal tissue;request - action;scanning;terminator (character concept);video-in video-out;x-ray (amazon kindle);x-ray computed tomography;angiogram;width	Qian Wang;Yang Yu;Keqin Pan;Jing Liu	2014	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2014.2317554	radiology;pathology;gallium;medical physics	Visualization	44.96789703933696	-86.42380944568724	26826

Until now, the usual remedy is to pixel shift by hand, or in some cases performing a global pixel shift semi-automatically. This is time consuming, and cannot handle rotations or local varying deformations over the image. We have developed a fully automatic algorithm that provides for motion compensation in the presence of large local deformations. Our motion compensation is very accurate for ordinary motions, including large rotations and deformations. It does not matter if the motions are irregular over time. For most images, it takes about a second per image to get adequate accuracy. The method is based on using the phase from lter banks of quadrature lters tuned in di erent directions and frequencies. Unlike traditional methods for optical ow and correlation, our method is more accurate and less susceptible to disturbing changes in the image, e.g. a moving contrast bolus. The implications for common practice are that radiologists' time can be signi cantly reduced in ordinary peripheral angiographies and that the number of retakes due to large or local motion artifacts will be much reduced.	algorithm;bolus tracking;motion compensation;peripheral;pixel;radiology;semiconductor industry;x-ray (amazon kindle)	Magnus Hemmendorff;Hans Knutsson;Mats T.

Our long-term goal is to integrate high resolution models routinely obtained from pre-procedure imaging (here, via MRI) with the low resolution, sparse, images, along with a few scalar measurements such as ECG, which are feasible during the real-time procedure. A key ingredient to facilitate this integration is the extraction from the pre-procedure model of an individualized, low complexity, dynamic model of the moving and beating heart. This is the immediate goal we address here. Our approach stems from work on distributed parameter dynamical systems and uses a combination of truncated basis expansions to obtain the requisite four dimensional low order model. The method's potential is illustrated not only by modeling results but also by estimation of an arbitrary slice from the parameterized model.	atrial fibrillation;dynamical system;heart atrium;image resolution;mathematical model;population parameter;real-time clock;sparse matrix	M.

Fan-beam projection data require special reconstruction techniques to be implemented. Among reconstruction techniques from parallel projection data, the direct Fourier method (DFM) proved to be one of the most promising ones, especially for high-speed image reconstruction in the high-end 3-D and dynamic tomographic systems. The goal of this work is to answer the topical question: how would direct use of the DFM influence the quality of image reconstruction from the fan-beam data? The formula describing the error caused by such an approximation is derived. The conclusions deduced from the formula are confirmed by computer simulations. The boundary values of data acquisition geometry parameters have been estimated for the case of using the DFM without recalculating the fan-beam data.	approximation;computer simulation;data acquisition;design for manufacturability;iterative reconstruction;parallel projection;physical object;projections and predictions;deferoxamine mesylate;fangchinoline	Stefano Alliney;Samuel Matej;Ivan Bajla	1993	IEEE transactions on medical imaging	10.1109/42.232246	iterative reconstruction;direct method;fourier transform;computer vision;electromagnetic radiation;quality control;approximation error;radiology;computer science;processing;mathematical model;mathematics;ionizing radiation;tomography;fourier analysis;optics;nuclear medicine;data acquisition;estimation theory;design for manufacturability;read-only memory;scientific control	Visualization	46.738808167213605	-80.84265882596118	27605

17707d8632b23dd7002fdea5281241d3aaa6ef3e	improved electromagnetic tracking for catheter path reconstruction with application in high-dose-rate brachytherapy	high dose rate brachytherapy;nonholonomic;electromagnetic tracking;catheter path reconstruction	Electromagnetic (EM) catheter tracking has recently been introduced in order to enable prompt and uncomplicated reconstruction of catheter paths in various clinical interventions. However, EM tracking is prone to measurement errors which can compromise the outcome of the procedure. Minimizing catheter tracking errors is therefore paramount to improve the path reconstruction accuracy. An extended Kalman filter (EKF) was employed to combine the nonlinear kinematic model of an EM sensor inside the catheter, with both its position and orientation measurements. The formulation of the kinematic model was based on the nonholonomic motion constraints of the EM sensor inside the catheter. Experimental verification was carried out in a clinical HDR suite. Ten catheters were inserted with mean curvatures varying from 0 to $$6.6~\hbox {m}^{-1}$$ 6.6 m - 1 in a phantom. A miniaturized Ascension (Burlington, Vermont, USA) trakSTAR EM sensor (model 55) was threaded within each catheter at various speeds ranging from 7.4 to $$32.1~\hbox {mm}\,\hbox {s}^{-1}$$ 32.1 mm s - 1 . The nonholonomic EKF was applied on the tracking data in order to statistically improve the EM tracking accuracy. A sample reconstruction error was defined at each point as the Euclidean distance between the estimated EM measurement and its corresponding ground truth. A path reconstruction accuracy was defined as the root mean square of the sample reconstruction errors, while the path reconstruction precision was defined as the standard deviation of these sample reconstruction errors. The impacts of sensor velocity and path curvature on the nonholonomic EKF method were determined. Finally, the nonholonomic EKF catheter path reconstructions were compared with the reconstructions provided by the manufacturer’s filters under default settings, namely the AC wide notch and the DC adaptive filter. With a path reconstruction accuracy of 1.9 mm, the nonholonomic EKF surpassed the performance of the manufacturer’s filters (2.4 mm) by 21% and the raw EM measurements (3.5 mm) by 46%. Similarly, with a path reconstruction precision of 0.8 mm, the nonholonomic EKF surpassed the performance of the manufacturer’s filters (1.0 mm) by 20% and the raw EM measurements (1.7 mm) by 53%. Path reconstruction accuracies did not follow an apparent trend when varying the path curvature and sensor velocity; instead, reconstruction accuracies were predominantly impacted by the position of the EM field transmitter ( $$ p\le 0.01$$ p ≤ 0.01 ). The advanced nonholonomic EKF is effective in reducing EM measurement errors when reconstructing catheter paths, is robust to path curvature and sensor speed, and runs in real time. Our approach is promising for a plurality of clinical procedures requiring catheter reconstructions, such as cardiovascular interventions, pulmonary applications (Bender et al. in medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention—MICCAI 99. Springer, Berlin, pp 981–989, 1999), and brachytherapy.	adaptive filter;brachytherapy;chromodoris joshi;default;electromagnetics;euclidean distance;extended kalman filter;gabor atom;ground truth;impacted tooth;mean squared error;medical records systems, computerized;medical image computing;natural science disciplines;ninety nine;nonlinear system;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;phone connector (audio);prostate carcinoma;rajiv joshi;reconstruction filter;springer (tank);standard deviation;tooth root structure;transmitter device component;velocity (software development);verification of theories;standards characteristics	Elodie Lugez;Hossein Sadjadi;Chandra P.

This problem can be formulated as a design problem where the goal is to determine the parameters of a partial differential operator to achieve a desired effect. These electrical current parameters are computed using a regularized iterative method. The obtained results reveal that employing an appropriate electrical current profile can reduce the fibrous tissue concentration around the considered implant by up to 80%. This preliminary study tends to demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel and non-invasive approach to shield the implant from intolerable levels of fibrous tissue growth, which consequently expands the lifespan and functionality of implanted devices, as well as avoids costly and traumatic surgical procedures.	behavior;biomaterials;brain implant;electric stimulation technique;electrical current;encapsulation (networking);experiment;han unification;iacuc number;implantation procedure;implants;iterative method;numerical analysis;operative surgical procedures;polyethylenes;procedure implants:finding:point in time:^patient:narrative;shield device component;tissue growth;verification and validation;verification of theories;video-in video-out	Shant Mahserejian;Paul Ryan;Rabia Djellouli;Randy Cohen	2014	2014 36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/EMBC.2014.6944258	biological engineering;mechanical engineering	DB	28.340095610592638	-85.78976818107199	28484
e557528f621d5b4b630df7a32d23dc37e8e12a97	real-time respiratory motion analysis using manifold ray casting of volumetrically fused multi-view range imaging		A novel real-time multi-sensor framework for range imaging (RI) based respiratory motion analysis in image guided interventions such as fractionated radiation therapy is presented. We constitute our method based upon real-time constraints in clinical practice and an analytic analysis of RI based elastic body surface deformation fields. For the latter, we show that the underlying joint rigid and non-rigid registration problem is ill-conditioned and identify insufficient body coverage as an error source. Facing these issues, we propose a novel manifold ray casting technique enabling the reconstruction of an 180 degrees coverage body surface model composed of - 3 x 10(5) points from volumetrically fused multi-view range data in - 25 ms. Exploiting the wide field of view surface model enabled by our method, we reduce the error in motion compensated patient alignment by a factor of 2.7 in the translational and 2.4 in the rotational component compared to conventional single sensor surface coverage.	body surface;condition number;experiment;fuse device component;genetic translation process;inference;muscle rigidity;numerous;patients;preparation;rs-232;range imaging;ray casting;real-time clock;real-time transcription;zentralblatt math;manifold	Jakob Wasza;Sebastian Bauer;Joachim Hornegger	2013	Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ...

The 2D images consist of one centered image obtained with the aperture at the center of optical system, and at least two directional images obtained with apertures at off-axis locations. The images can be obtained simultaneously or sequentially. The 2D images are sectioned into different depths by computational method resulting in a set of decoupled 2D layers of the 3D object at different axial planes. The 3D image is displayed by color-coding. This technique provides fast data acquisition and fast image reconstruction and eliminates problems associated with motion, phototoxicity and photobleaching.	3d computer graphics;color-coding;data acquisition;iterative reconstruction;optic axis of a crystal	Shuhong Li;Cha-Mei Tang;Cha-Min Tang	2004	2004 2nd IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: Nano to Macro (IEEE Cat No. 04EX821)		iterative reconstruction;stereoscopy;three-dimensional space;computer vision;radiology;medicine;optical microscope;mathematics;optics;data acquisition;image formation	Vision	46.93612306663962	-85.9347770928852	28649
4d57fc42eacfbcbdfd198a3878318eb1591a7fe0	monitoring of cardiac output and lung ventilation by electrical impedance tomography in a porcine model of acute lung injury		Adequate medical treatment of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome is still challenging since patient-individual aspects have to be taken into account. Lung protective ventilation and hemodynamic stability have always been two of the most crucial aims of intensive care therapy. For both aspects, a continuous - preferably non-invasive - monitoring is desirable that is available at the bedside. Unfortunately, there is no technique clinically established yet, that provides both measurement of cardiac stroke volume and ventilation dynamics in real-time. Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a promising technique to close this gap. The aim of the study was to investigate if stroke volume can be estimated by a self-developed software using EIT-based image analysis. In addition, two EIT-derived parameters, namely Global Inhomogeneity Index (GII) and Impedance Ratio (IR), were calculated to evaluate homogeneity of air distribution.	acute lung injury;artificial cardiac pacemaker;body mass index;cardiography, impedance;cerebrovascular accident;characteristic impedance;distress (novel);electromagnetically induced transparency;hemodynamics;image analysis;international normalized ratio;internet;nominal impedance;patients;porcine species;quantitative impedance;real-time clock;respiration;respiratory distress syndrome, adult;stroke volume;structure of parenchyma of lung;tomography, emission-computed, single-photon;electric impedance;tomography	Nadine Hochhausen;Henriette Dohmeier;Rolf Rossaint;Michael Czaplik	2017	2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2017.8036835	electronic engineering;stroke volume;lung;acute respiratory distress;electrical impedance tomography;ventilation (architecture);internal medicine;intensive care medicine;hemodynamics;cardiac stroke volume;cardiac output;cardiology;medicine	Visualization	43.78239653662161	-87.2815460513892	28769

To avoid resource overload and to guarantee the throughput of dynamic applications, we present a method for complexity prediction of image registration and motion-compensation algorithms, which can have a highly dynamic nature at runtime. As a case study, we explore a medical imaging function to reduce motion-artifacts in X-ray Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA). Complexity prediction is based on motion estimation, prior to the actual image registration. Experimental results show that it is possible to model a dynamic contentdependent processing task with a high accuracy (95%, standard deviation 5%), thereby facilitating a higher quality for remaining tasks and well defined options for QoS.	algorithm;image registration;medical imaging;motion compensation;motion estimation;quality of service;real-time transcription;run time (program lifecycle phase);throughput	Rob Albers;Eric Suijs;Peter H.

First, 3D level sets are relatively slow to compute. Second, their formulation usually entails several free parameters which can be very difficult to correctly tune for specific applications. The second problem is compounded by the first. This paper describes a new tool for 3D segmentation that addresses these problems by computing level-set surface models at interactive rates. This tool employs two important, novel technologies. First is the mapping of a 3D level-set solver onto a commodity graphics card (GPU). This mapping relies on a novel mechanism for GPU memory management. The interactive rates level-set PDE solver give the user immediate feedback on the parameter settings, and thus users can tune free parameters and control the shape of the model in real time. The second technology is the use of intensity-based speed functions, which allow a user to quickly and intuitively specify the behavior of the deformable model. We have found that the combination of these interactive tools enables users to produce good, reliable segmentations. To support this observation, this paper presents qualitative results from several different datasets as well as a quantitative evaluation from a study of brain tumor segmentations.	addresses (publication format);anatomic structures;brain neoplasms;computation (action);gist;graphics processing unit;image segmentation;imagery;interface device component;medical image;memory disorders;memory management;population parameter;real-time clock;regular expression;solver;statistical classification;video card;biologic segmentation	Joshua E.

Having an elastic but still compact model of this variability is an important step towards reliable targeting in radiation therapy. To build this model, the deformation of the liver at exhalation was determined for 12 volunteers over roughly one hour using 4DMRI and subsequent non-rigid registration. The correspondence between subjects was established based on mechanically relevant landmarks on the liver surface. Leave-one-out experiments were performed to evaluate the accuracy in predicting the liver deformation from partial information, such as a point tracked by ultrasound imaging. Already predictions from a single point strongly reduced the localisation errors, whilst the method is robust with respect to the exact choice of the measured predictor.	experiment;expiration, function;kerrison predictor;liver diseases;medical ultrasound;muscle rigidity;quasiperiodicity;spatial variability;statistical model;while;cellular targeting;establishment and maintenance of localization	Martin von Siebenthal;Gábor Székely;Alan J.

Our method relies on an air-tissue segmentation of intraoperative patient specific data, which is used as an input to a subsequent field simulation step. The generated simulation can then be used to enhance the precision of image-guidance. We report results of our method on 12 patient datasets acquired during image-guided neurosurgery for anterior lobe resection for surgical management of focal temporal lobe epilepsy.

Unfortunately, recent results suggest that heating tumor tissue to necrosis is complicated because nearby major blood vessels provide a cooling effect. Therefore, it is fundamentally important for physicians to perform a careful analysis of the spatial relationship of diseased tissue to larger liver blood vessels. The liver contains many of these large vessels, which affect the RFA ablation shape and size. There are many sophisticated vasculature detection and segmentation techniques reported in the literature that identify continuous vessels as the diameter changes size and it transgresses through many bifurcation levels. However, the larger blood vessels near the treatment area are the only vessels required for proper RFA treatment plan formulation and analysis. With physician guidance and interaction, our system can segment those vessels which are most likely to affect the RFA ablations. We have found that our system provides the physician with therapeutic, geometric and spatial information necessary to accurately plan treatment of tumors near large blood vessels. The segmented liver vessels near the treatment region are also necessary for computing isolevel heating profiles used to evaluate different proposed treatment configurations.© (2006) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

We then use them in the inverse problem with known internal boundaries and derive the associated Jacobians. We report on the results of two EIT phantom studies, one using a homogeneous cubical tank, and one using a cylindrical tank with agar conductivity inhomogeneities. We test both the accuracy of our BEM forward model, including the electrode models, as well as our inverse solution, against the measured data.

In this article it is shown that the similarity measure and its derivatives also can be calculated on the GPU, using a two pass approach.

Traditional studies typically use a monocular imaging setup, thus limiting investigation to a restricted region of tissue. However, studies of large-scale wavefront dynamics, especially those during fibrillation and defibrillation, would benefit from visualization of the entire epicardial surface. To solve this problem, a panoramic cardiac visualization algorithm was developed which performs the two tasks of reconstruction of the surface geometry of the heart, and representation of the panoramic fluorescence information as a texture mapping onto the geometry that was previously created. This system permits measurement of epicardial electrodynamics over a geometrically realistic representation of the actual heart being studied. To verify the accuracy of the algorithm, the procedure was applied to synthetic images of a patterned ball; further verification was provided by application of the algorithm to a model heart placed in the experimental setup. Both sets of images produced mean registration image errors on the order of 2 pixels, corresponding to roughly 3 mm on the geometry. The authors demonstrate the algorithm by visualizing epicardial wavefronts on an isolated, perfused rabbit heart.	cardiac electrophysiology;electric countershock;fibrillations;fluorescence;heart valve disease;imagery;license;membrane potentials;optical imaging;pixel;preparation;synthetic intelligence;texture mapping;verification of theories;algorithm;registration - actclass	Mark-Anthony Bray;Shien-Fong Lin;John P.

3b0824b0ec9d90368b9e08fe56e606d0a1aa2900	a unified probabilistic computational framework for cross-domain compensated medical imaging		The quality of medical imaging is an important factor that can directly affect on the results of different medical imaging tests which routinely being used for various clinical studies and related research. The existence of any type of image imperfection such as different noise and artifacts can make some difficulties for the correct analyzing and consequent interpretation of medical imaging test results and even may impact on the overall decision of the performed clinical procedure. Due to this issue, there is always a motivation for the quality enhancement of medical imaging that needs to be done by correcting for the different image degradation that typically arise during medical image capture or reconstruction. Computational compensated imaging provides a useful, cheap and easy solution for the quality enhancement of different types of medical imaging when it compares to the similar hardware-based compensation methods. A computational compensated medical imaging basically aims to recover a compensated (true) image from degraded medical measurement that is affected by the different types of acquisition/reconstruction image degradation. Compensating for each single image degradation issue can be useful for the quality improvement of medical imaging. Having a computational compensated imaging framework to jointly correct for multiple acquisition/reconstruction degradation issues can improve the functionality of current existing compensated imaging frameworks as they mostly account only for a single specific type of degradation issue. This work presents a novel probabilistic based computational compensated medical imaging which is able to jointly account for several acquisition/reconstruction degradation issues from the different domains in a unified computational framework. The developed computational cross-domain compensated medical imaging specifically takes advantage of a stochastically fully connected conditional random field (SFC-CRF) model in its framework which improves the performance of the proposed compensated medical imaging in producing of a desired compensated medical image. A compensated optical coherence tomography (C-OCT) imaging is developed within the framework of proposed computational cross-domain compensated medical imaging and with aiming to jointly compensate for the degradation due to the optical aberrations and speckle noise in OCT imaging. The developed C-OCT imaging is expanded to design a compensated super resolution OCT (C-SR-OCT) imaging framework which is able to generate a super resolution OCT (SR-OCT) image of higher quality from multiple OCT measurements. The proposed computational cross-domain compensated medical imaging is also used to develop a compensated magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) framework which aims to improve the quality of MR imaging from different modalities by jointly correcting	autostereogram;computation;conditional random field;elegant degradation;medical imaging;resonance;space-filling curve;super-resolution imaging;tomography	Ameneh Boroomand	2016				Vision	49.20249547004231	-83.07900815405927	30085

Although prevailing technology allows accurate localization of lesions, they cannot yet be precisely targeted. Needle steering is a promising technique to overcome this challenge. In this paper, we describe the development of a novel steering system for an actuated-tip flexible needle. Strain measurements from an array of Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors are used for online reconstruction of the needle shape in 3D-space. FBG-sensor data is then fused with ultrasound images obtained from a clinically-approved Automated Breast Volume Scanner (ABVS) using an unscented Kalman filter. A new ultrasound-based tracking algorithm is developed for the robust tracking of the needle in biological tissue. Two experimental cases are presented to evaluate the proposed steering system. In the first case, the needle shape is reconstructed using the tracked tip position in ultrasound images and FBG-sensor measurements, separately. The reconstructed shape is then compared with the actual 3D needle shape obtained from the ABVS. In the second case, two steering experiments are performed to evaluate the overall system by fusing the FBG-sensor data and ultrasound images. Average targeting errors are 1.29±0.41 mm and 1.42±0.72 mm in gelatin phantom and biological tissue, respectively.	algorithm;artificial neural network;experiment;imaging phantom;kalman filter;kennisbank filosofie nederland;motion planning;optical fiber;sensor	Navid Shahriari;Roy J.

The method employs a computationally efficient two-frame linear predictor which exploits the spatio-temporal coherence of the data. By performing segmentation using the RF data we are able to overcome problems due to image inhomogeneities that are often amplified in B-mode segmentation, as well as provide geometric constraints for RF phase-based speckle tracking. We illustrate the advantages of our approach by comparing it to manual tracings of B-mode data and automated B-mode boundary detection using standard (Chan and Vese-based) level sets on echocardiographic images from 28 3D sequences acquired from 6 canine studies, imaged both at baseline and 1 hour post infarction.

The approach utilizes the Fourier relationship between the water displacement probabilities and diffusion attenuated magnetic resonance (MR) signal expressed in spherical coordinates. The Laplace series coefficients of the water displacement probabilities are evaluated at a fixed distance away from the origin. The computations take under one minute for most three-dimensional datasets. We present orientation maps computed from excised rat optic chiasm, brain and spinal cord images.

d062515603505b315c9201c9e47287a7aa4b2c0b	gpu implementation of levenberg-marquardt optimization for ti mapping		T1 mapping is an emerging MRI research tool to characterize diseased myocardial tissue. The Ti map is generated by fitting an exponential relaxation curve to the acquired image data. Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is a standard way to solve this nonlinear curve fitting problem. However, the execution on the standard CPU can be time-consuming and incompatible with clinical routine. In this paper, a GPU implementation is performed to reduce the computation time of the standard T1 mapping. In addition, a new vectorized approach is proposed to include spatial regularization in the curve fitting process to improve the robustness. The GPU implementation is validated on NVIDIA K42000 GPU using cardiac T1 data from 16 volunteers. The computation time shows significant decrease in both pixel-wise and vectorized curve fitting. The pixel-wise curve fitting is accelerated by a factor of 30+ compared to the standard sequential C code and the vectorized curve fitting is improved by a factor of 47 and 38 for 3-parameter and 2-parameter curve fitting compared to the Matlab code.	central processing unit;computation;curve fitting;graphics processing unit;levenberg–marquardt algorithm;linear programming relaxation;matlab;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;pixel;time complexity	Shufang Liu;Aurélien Bustin;Darius Burschka;Anne Menini;Freddy Odille	2017	2017 Computing in Cardiology (CinC)		robustness (computer science);matlab;mathematical optimization;computation;regularization (mathematics);curve fitting;nonlinear system;levenberg–marquardt algorithm;exponential function;computer science	Robotics	48.22215381411859	-80.97096490638889	31071

Existing methods are either not sufficiently accurate or are limited by the computation time required. The goal of this study was to develop an MR-based attenuation correction method that accurately separates bone tissue from air and provides continuous-valued attenuation coefficients for bone.   MATERIALS AND METHODS PET/MRI and CT datasets were obtained from 98 subjects (mean age [±SD]: 66yrs [±9.8], 57 females) using an IRB-approved protocol and with informed consent. Subjects were injected with 352±29MBq of (18)F-Florbetapir tracer, and PET acquisitions were begun either immediately or 50min after injection. CT images of the head were acquired separately using a PET/CT system. Dual echo ultrashort echo-time (UTE) images and two-point Dixon images were acquired. Regions of air were segmented via a threshold of the voxel-wise multiplicative inverse of the UTE echo 1 image. Regions of bone were segmented via a threshold of the R2* image computed from the UTE echo 1 and UTE echo 2 images. Regions of fat and soft tissue were segmented using fat and water images decomposed from the Dixon images. Air, fat, and soft tissue were assigned linear attenuation coefficients (LACs) of 0, 0.092, and 0.1cm(-1), respectively. LACs for bone were derived from a regression analysis between corresponding R2* and CT values. PET images were reconstructed using the gold standard CT method and the proposed CAR-RiDR method.   RESULTS The RiDR segmentation method produces mean Dice coefficient±SD across subjects of 0.75±0.05 for bone and 0.60±0.08 for air. The CAR model for bone LACs greatly improves accuracy in estimating CT values (28.2%±3.0 mean error) compared to the use of a constant CT value (46.9%±5.8, p<10(-6)). Finally, the CAR-RiDR method provides a low whole-brain mean absolute percent-error (MAPE±SD) in PET reconstructions across subjects of 2.55%±0.86. Regional PET errors were also low and ranged from 0.88% to 3.79% in 24 brain ROIs.   CONCLUSION We propose an MR-based attenuation correction method (CAR-RiDR) for quantitative PET neurological imaging. The proposed method employs UTE and Dixon images and consists of two novel components: 1) accurate segmentation of air and bone using the inverse of the UTE1 image and the R2* image, respectively and 2) estimation of continuous LAC values for bone using a regression between R2* and CT-Hounsfield units. From our analysis, we conclude that the proposed method closely approaches (<3% error) the gold standard CT-scaled method in PET reconstruction accuracy.	aim alliance;asea irb;attenuation correction;bone tissue;ct scan;coefficient;computation;consent forms;dixon's factorization method;dual;echo 2;estimated;fatty acid glycerol esters;file allocation table;lambda calculus;linear iga bullous dermatosis;mitral valve insufficiency;personnameuse - assigned;photons;platelet glycoprotein 4, human;polyethylene terephthalate;positron-emission tomography;quantitation;time complexity;tracer;voxel;biologic segmentation;soft tissue	Meher R.

While performing deformation on patients' medical volume data provides a realistic venue to define the most suitable operative strategy, the current simulators rely heavily on human efforts for data preprocessing. Such manual procedures not only require special knowledge from the users, they are tedious and time-consuming. This paper presents a novel volume sampling approach for preoperative planning by automating various conventional data preprocessing procedures. The optimization method is capable of adapting to any volume data and supports heterogeneous tissue characterization such that anatomical surroundings deform together with the deforming organ. In this way, physicians' user experience in surgical manipulation will be greatly improved. Results of the experiments suggested that the presented segmentation-free and modeling-free method is a more efficient and practical approach to interactive medical simulation.	computer graphics;data pre-processing;experiment;mathematical optimization;preprocessor;sampling (signal processing);simulation;user experience;venue (sound system)	Kei Wai Cecilia Hung;Megumi Nakao;Kotaro Minato	2009	2009 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro	10.1109/ISBI.2009.5193236	medical simulation;computer vision;simulation;radiology;computer science;biomechanics;data pre-processing;solid modeling;computer graphics;computational model	Visualization	38.095890090600285	-85.65506710164611	31544

This paper reports the semi-active needle-guiding robot for MR-guided therapy by which a surgeon can freely selects needle insertion path while maintaining the remote center of motion at the pre-defined tumor site. The robot consists of three-degree-of-freedom active XYZ base stage with ultrasonic motors and passive needle holder with unconstrained two-degree-of-freedom rotation measured by optical fiber sensor with aluminum die cast. Once the target point on the tumor is defined in volumetric MR images, the base stage keeps the remote-center-of-motion at the target point, while physician can interactively selects the orientation of the needle path with continuous single slice MR imaging. Experiments to test the accuracy of remote-center-of-motion indicated that the robot can keep the needle tip with an average error of 0.7 ∼ 0.3 mm in the compatibility test showed the robot can be safely used in MR axial plane, and 1.0-0.4 mm in the sagittal plane. Unlike related studies published elsewhere where the MR compatible robot autonomously brings the tools to predefined location, the proposed approach is fit to use in microwave thermotherapy of liver cancer.	fiber optic sensor;interactivity;microwave;optical fiber;reliability-centered maintenance;resonance;robot;semiconductor industry;xyz file format	Nobuhiko Hata;Ryuji Hashimoto;Junichi Tokuda;Shigeo Morikawa	2005	Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570350	ultrasonic motor;engineering;fiber optic sensor;magnetic resonance imaging;software testing;biological engineering;degrees of freedom;nuclear magnetic resonance	Robotics	40.2504022065152	-85.30311175928334	31673
a628bf0e7a1dfa95607fcbf78435d0895fdd0bec	a new neonatal cortical and subcortical brain atlas: the melbourne children's regional infant brain (m-crib) atlas	infant;t(2)-weighted mri;ground truth;manual parcellation;template	Investigating neonatal brain structure and function can offer valuable insights into behaviour and cognition in healthy and clinical populations; both at term age, and longitudinally in comparison with later time points. Parcellated brain atlases for adult populations are readily available, however warping infant data to adult template space is not ideal due to morphological and tissue differences between these groups. Several parcellated neonatal atlases have been developed, although there remains strong demand for manually parcellated ground truth data with detailed cortical definition. Additionally, compatibility with existing adult atlases is favourable for use in longitudinal investigations. We aimed to address these needs by replicating the widely-used Desikan-Killiany (2006) adult cortical atlas in neonates. We also aimed to extend brain coverage by complementing this cortical scheme with basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum and other subcortical segmentations. Thus, we have manually parcellated these areas volumetrically using high-resolution neonatal T2-weighted MRI scans, and initial automated and manually edited tissue classification, providing 100 regions in all. Linear and nonlinear T2-weighted structural templates were also generated. In this paper we provide manual parcellation protocols, and present the parcellated probability maps and structural templates together as the Melbourne Children's Regional Infant Brain (M-CRIB) atlas.	atlases;basal (phylogenetics);basal ganglia;brain atlas;cervical atlas;clinical use template;cognition;compliance behavior;cortical cell layer of the cerebellum;display resolution;ground truth;image resolution;infant;infant, newborn;map;medical device incompatibility problem;nonlinear system;population;protocols documentation;scanning;science;texture atlas;thalamic structure;the australian;childhood cerebellar astrocytoma	Bonnie Alexander;Andrea L.

Researchers studied how volume rendering incorporating global illumination impacted perception of bone surface features captured by x-ray computed-tomography scanners for clinical monitoring of rheumatoid arthritis patients. The results, evaluated by clinical researchers familiar with the disease and medical-image interpretation, indicate that interactive visualization with global illumination helped the researchers derive more accurate interpretations of the image data. With clinical needs and the recent advancement of volume visualization technology, this study is timely and points the way for further research.	global illumination;hardware acceleration;imagery;impacted tooth;interactive visualization;interpretation process;medical imaging;patients;physical object;plain x-ray;rheumatoid arthritis;scientific visualization;surface of bone;visualization software;volume rendering;x-ray computed tomography	Lin Zheng;Abhijit J.

It is an extension of our previously introduced solution. The original scheme provides an efficient and non-iterative method for designing the fastest freely rotatable gradient waveforms. Here, the hardware constraints are relaxed so that each axis is constrained independently. This produces the fastest possible non-rotatable waveforms that can be up to 10% faster than their previous counterparts. In addition, for circular trajectories we relax the path constraints. This results in new diamond-shaped trajectories, which are more optimized than circles for separable gradient sets, reducing the total travel time by up to an additional 11%. Analysis of performance for a variety of parameters including the sensitivity to field inhomogeneity compared to freely rotatable circle trajectories is presented.	apache axis;fastest;gradient;iterative method;lagrangian relaxation;sensitivity and specificity	Sara Vaziri;Michael Lustig	2013	2013 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging	10.1109/ISBI.2013.6556573	algorithm design;mathematical optimization;radiology;medicine;computer science;trajectory;magnetic resonance imaging;mathematics;geometry;nuclear magnetic resonance	Vision	48.8868595491436	-80.93877889086916	32192

Computed Tomography (CT) remains one of the most widely used imaging modality for acute stroke diagnosis. However when coupled with CT perfusion, the excessive radiation exposure in repetitive imaging to assess treatment response and prognosis has raised significant public concerns regarding its potential hazards to both shortand long-term health outcomes. Tensor total variation has been proposed to reduce the necessary radiation dose in CT perfusion without comprising the image quality by fusing the information of the local anatomical structure with the temporal blood flow model. However the local search in the TTV framework fails to leverage the non-local information in the spatiotemporal data. In this paper, we propose TENDER, an efficient framework of non-local tensor deconvolution to maintain the accuracy of the hemodynamic parameters and the diagnostic reliability in low radiation dose CT perfusion. The tensor total variation is extended using non-local spatio-temporal cubics for regularization, and an efficient algorithm is proposed to reduce the time complexity with speedy similarity computation. Evaluations on clinical data of patients subjects with cerebrovascular disease and normal subjects demonstrate the advantage of non-local tensor deconvolution for reducing radiation dose in CT perfusion.	algorithm;ct scan;computation;computational complexity theory;deconvolution;estimation theory;hemodynamics;image quality;local search (optimization);mathematical optimization;matrix regularization;medical imaging;perfusion scanning;quantum nonlocality;time complexity;tomography;total variation denoising	Ruogu Fang;Ajay Gupta;Junzhou Huang;Pina C.

Due to large colonic deformations induced by the colonoscope, even very experienced colonoscopists find it difficult to pinpoint the exact location of the colonoscope tip in relation to polyps reported on CTC. This can cause unduly prolonged OC examinations that are stressful for the patient, colonoscopist and supporting staff. We developed a method, based on monocular 3D reconstruction from OC images, that automatically matches polyps observed in OC with polyps reported on prior CTC. A matching cost is computed, using rigid point-based registration between surface point clouds extracted from both modalities. A 3D printed and painted phantom of a 25 cm long transverse colon segment was used to validate the method on two medium sized polyps. Results indicate that the matching cost is smaller at the correct corresponding polyp between OC and CTC: the value is 3.9 times higher at the incorrect polyp, comparing the correct match between polyps to the incorrect match. Furthermore, we evaluate the matching of the reconstructed polyp from OC with other colonic endoluminal surface structures such as haustral folds and show that there is a minimum at the correct polyp from CTC. Automated matching between polyps observed at OC and prior CTC would facilitate the biopsy or removal of true-positive pathology or exclusion of false-positive CTC findings, and would reduce colonoscopy false-negative (missed) polyps. Ultimately, such a method might reduce healthcare costs, patient inconvenience and discomfort.	3d reconstruction;ct scan;colon classification;imaging phantom;phantom reference;point cloud;printing;transverse wave;virtual colonoscopy	Holger Roth;Thomas Hampshire;Emma Helbren;Mingxing Hu;Roser Vega;Steve Halligan;David J.

Pre-evaluation of donors prior to surgery of living donated liver transplantation is one of the challenging applications that computer aided systems are needed. The precise measurement of liver volume requires effective segmentation procedures, while three dimensional rendering of the segmented data provides demonstrative information to radiologists and surgeons before surgery. The Insight Toolkit provides effective algorithms for segmentation, which are also optimized for high computational performance and processing time. Furthermore, An ITK pipeline can be combined with a VTK pipeline, so that the result of segmentation can be represented directly in 3-D using VTK. Therefore, there is an on-going trend for developing ITK/VTK based systems. This study presents quantitative and qualitative performance evaluation of two effective ITK algorithms on segmentation of liver from CTA data sets.		M.

Seeds were reconstructed using a typical C-arm, and exported to a commercial brachytherapy system for dosimetry analysis. Technical obstacles for 3D reconstruction on a non-isocentric C-arm included pose-dependent C-arm calibration; distortion correction; pose estimation of C-arm images; seed reconstruction; and C-arm to TRUS registration. In precision-machined hard phantoms with 40-100 seeds, we correctly reconstructed 99.8% seeds with a mean 3D accuracy of 0.68 mm. In soft tissue phantoms with 45-87 seeds and clinically realistic 15 degrees C-arm motion, we correctly reconstructed 100% seeds with an accuracy of 1.3 mm. The reconstructed 3D seed positions were then registered to the prostate segmented from TRUS. In a Phase-1 clinical trial, so far on 4 patients with 66-84 seeds, we achieved intra-operative monitoring of seed distribution and dosimetry. We optimized the 100% prescribed iso-dose contour by inserting an average of 3.75 additional seeds, making intra-operative dosimetry possible on a typical C-arm, at negligible additional cost to the existing clinical installation.	3d reconstruction;brachytherapy;calibration;clinical act of insertion;distortion;emoticon;exanthema;imaging phantom;patients;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;plant seeds;prostatic neoplasms;radioactivity;radiometry;registration;scalability;seeds (cellular automaton);the 100;biologic segmentation;extensive stage small cell lung cancer;soft tissue;transrectal ultrasound	Ameet K.

Also, the inter-observer variability between expert radiologists is studied. The preprocessing method used was background trend correction. The algorithm, based on searching the steepest changes on a probabilistic cost function, was tested on 107 cancerous masses and 98 benign masses. Their density ratings were 3 and 4 according to the ACR density rating scale. The computer-segmented results were validated using the overlap, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Dice similarity index, and kappa statistics. The mean values for the accuracy statistic ranged from 0.71-0.84 for cancer cases and 0.81-0.86 for benign cases. For nearly all statistics there were statistically significant differences between the expert radiologists.	algorithm;inter-rater reliability;loss function;preprocessor;radiology;rating scale;sensitivity and specificity;spatial variability	Lisa M.

In this study, mice were subject to both hind limb suspension and cast mediated immobilization. Pre-treatment and post-treatment microCT scans were utilized to create finite element models. Both pre-treatment and posttreatment scans were then cropped, rotated and threedimensional image registration was performed to eliminate inconsistency in alignment. A hexahedral finite element mesh was then generated from this 3D data. Finite element analysis was conducted to perform simulated physiological loading of the femoral neck to assess bone strength through bone structural morphology. Hind limb suspension combined with Cast Mediated Immobilization caused a 7.9% decrease in bone FEA stiffness compared to the in-vivo pre-treatment control. No differences were found in bone volume or structural efficiency.	alignment;atrophic;bed rest;bone marrow diseases;bone tissue;data point;f9 embryonic antigen gene;federal enterprise architecture;finite element method in structural mechanics;flat ductal epithelial atypia of the breast;galaxy morphological classification;hexahedron;high-level synthesis;image registration;immobiliser;limb prosthesis;lower extremity;muscular atrophy;muscular dystrophies, limb-girdle;p-value;patients;scanning;structure of neck of femur;suspensions;video-in video-out;x-ray microtomography;registration - actclass	Matthew J.

f4092fb616ca017194a1a4d2c52852f81148afaa	a robust method for ventriculomegaly detection from neonatal brain ultrasound images	intracranial pressure;ventriculomegaly;coronal view;intraventricular foramina;anterior horn width	Ventriculomegaly is the most commonly detected abnormality in neonatal brain. It can be defined as a condition when the human brain ventricle system becomes dilated. This in turn increases the intracranial pressure inside the skull resulting in progressive enlargement of the head. Sometimes it may also cause mental disability or death. For these reasons early detection of ventriculomegaly has become an important task. In order to identify ventriculomegaly from neonatal brain ultrasound images, we propose an automated image processing based approach that measures the anterior horn width as the distance between medial wall and floor of the lateral ventricle at the widest point. Measurement is done in the plane of the scan at the level of the intraventricular foramina. Our study is based on neonatal brain ultrasound images in the midline coronal view. In addition to ventriculomegaly detection, this work also includes both cross sectional and longitudinal study of anterior horn width of lateral ventricles. Experiments were carried out on brain ultrasound images of 96 neonates with gestational age ranging from 26 to 39 weeks and results have been verified with the ground truth provided by doctors. Accuracy of the proposed scheme is quite promising.	brain implant;cns disorder;cerebral ventricles;cessation of life;data collection;early diagnosis;ground truth;heart ventricle;hypertrophy;image processing;infant, newborn;intracranial pressure;lateral computing;lateral thinking;lateral ventricle structure;medial graph;midline thalamic nuclei;neonatology;progressive scan;spinal cord anterior gray column;transaction counts and value totals - contract;width	Prasenjit Mondal;Jayanta Mukhopadhyay;Shamik Sural;Arun K.

The method is based on the assumption that a range of pixel intensities in CT data defines the edge of a tumor, and from our statistical model, we assign a probability that a given pixel intensity is included in the tumor measurement. Using the magnitude of the gradient of the pixel intensities over the density range observed for lung tumors and lung tissue, we have found consistent metrics that help define these weights, so that the measurement does not require user-controlled parameters and can be performed automatically. This could ultimately lead to direct comparisons of measurements from different medical laboratories.	ct scan;gradient;pixel;statistical model;tomography	Adele P. Peskin;Karen Kafadar;A. M.

To replace implanted markers as a gold standard, however, tagged MRI must be able to track a sparse set of material points, so-called material markers, with high accuracy. This paper presents a new method for generating accurate motion estimates over a sparse set of material points using standard, parallel-tagged MR images. Each tracked point is located at the intersection of three tag surfaces, each of which is estimated using a thin-plate spline. The intersections are determined by an iterative alternating projections algorithm for which a proof of convergence is provided. The resulting data sets are compatible with applications developed to exploit implanted marker data. One set of these material markers from a normal human volunteer is examined in detail using several methods to visualize the markers. Numerical results that include additional studies are also discussed. Finally, an error analysis is presented using a computer-simulated left ventricle for which material markers are tracked with an RMS error of approximately 0.2 mm for typical imaging parameters and noise levels.	algorithm;computer simulation;convergence (action);error analysis (mathematics);estimated;heart ventricle;implants;iterative method;left ventricular structure;magnetic resonance imaging;numerical method;projections and predictions;sparse language;sparse matrix;tagged architecture;thin plate spline;tracer	William S.

3cdb8f9f0120614186dc6bff98292fc751aadab8	modified simultaneous motion estimation and image reconstruction (m-smeir) for 4d-cbct		Motion estimation using four-dimensional (4D) X-ray cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is important to achieve a precise radiation therapy of lung cancer patients. If the conventional three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction methods were used, the radiation dose would be much higher to obtain satisfying 4D images. Previously, we developed a simultaneous motion estimation and image reconstruction (SMEIR) method to reconstruct high-quality images and to obtain the motion model using a regular 3D CBCT scan. Due to non-convexity of the problem, the solution of SMEIR depends on the initial deformation vector fields (DVFs) and could be trapped in local optima. In this study, we develop a practical approach to alleviate this problem: First, each phase image is reconstructed using SMEIR with initial DVFs estimated from 3D reconstruction with total variation (TV) minimization. Then, DVFs are updated by applying the demons registration method on all SMEIR reconstructed phase images and used as the initial DVFs for the second round SMEIR. This modified SMEIR (m-SMEIR) method was tested using a CBCT simulation study of 4D NCAT digital phantom. The results demonstrate that m-SMEIR can yield better image quality than the SMEIR method. More importantly, m-SMEIR can produce much improved motion fields compared to SMEIR (47% improvement measured by the mean deviation from the true tumor motion), likely due to m-SMEIR's capability of jumping out of the local optimum.	3d computer graphics;3d reconstruction;ct scan;image quality;iterative reconstruction;local optimum;motion estimation;phantom reference;simulation	Cong Zhao;Yuncheng Zhong;Jing Wang;Mingwu Jin	2018	2018 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2018)	10.1109/ISBI.2018.8363588	3d reconstruction;iterative reconstruction;absolute deviation;computer vision;motion estimation;computed tomography;image quality;artificial intelligence;imaging phantom;computer science;radiation	Vision	44.591736133916015	-82.5026695386003	34290

Then, surgical paths planned on the computer displayed images can be transformed to the robot frame, and the robot is thus capable to move surgical tools to the preplanned location. The positioning error is about 2 mm and the orientation error is about 0.23◦.	ct scan;fiducial marker;robot;robotic mapping;transformation matrix	Ching-Shiow Tseng;Chiao-Chi Huang;Chen-San Chen	2007	Robotica	10.1017/S0263574706003195	computer vision;simulation;engineering;engineering drawing	Robotics	40.195922811627376	-84.85658051300294	34317

8c933328629738875cfaab4f9cc64b1ece23bd19	automatic 3d us brain ventricle segmentation in pre-term neonates using multi-phase geodesic level-sets with shape prior		Pre-term neonates born with a low birth weight (u003c 1500g) are at increased risk for developing intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). 3D ultrasound (US) imaging has been used to quantitatively monitor the ventricular volume in IVH neonates, instead of typical 2D US used clinically, which relies on linear measurements from a single slice and visually estimates to determine ventricular dilation. To translate 3D US imaging into clinical setting, an accurate segmentation algorithm would be desirable to automatically extract the ventricular system from 3D US images. In this paper, we propose an automatic multi-region segmentation approach for delineating lateral ventricles of pre-term neonates from 3D US images, which makes use of multi-phase geodesic level-sets (MP-GLS) segmentation technique via a variational region competition principle and a spatial shape prior derived from pre-segmented atlases. Experimental results using 15 IVH patient images show that the proposed GPU-implemented approach is accurate in terms of the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), the mean absolute surface distance (MAD), and maximum absolute surface distance (MAXD). To the best of our knowledge, this paper reports the first study on automatic segmentation of ventricular system of premature neonatal brains from 3D US images.

While addressing this challenge may be beneficial to US examinations in general, it is particularly useful in situations where portable US probes are used by less experienced personnel. The proposed solution is based on the hypothesis that, rather than their appearance in a single image, anatomical structures are most distinctively characterized by the variation of their appearance as the transducer moves. By drawing on recent advances in the non-linear modeling of video appearance and motion, using an extension of dynamic textures, successful location and recognition is demonstrated on two phantoms. We further analyze computational demands and preliminarily explore insensitivity to anatomic variations.	anatomic structures;autostereogram;nonlinear system;phantoms, imaging;transducer;videocassette	Roland Kwitt;Nuno Vasconcelos;Sharif Razzaque;Stephen R.

6680fba574d734199472e94bebbd4ac2dd58cf8f	validation of three-dimensional models of the distal femur created from surgical navigation point cloud data for intraoperative and postoperative analysis of total knee arthroplasty	navigation;arthroplasty;statistical shape model;knee	Despite the success of total knee arthroplasty, there continues to be a significant proportion of patients who are dissatisfied. One explanation may be a shape mismatch between pre- and postoperative distal femurs. The purpose of this study was to investigate methods suitable for matching a statistical shape model (SSM) to intraoperatively acquired point cloud data from a surgical navigation system and to validate these against the preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from the same patients. A total of 10 patients who underwent navigated total knee arthroplasty also had an MRI scan <2 months preoperatively. The standard surgical protocol was followed which included partial digitization of the distal femur. Two different methods were employed to fit the SSM to the digitized point cloud data, based on (1) iterative closest points and (2) Gaussian mixture models. The available MRI data were manually segmented and the reconstructed three-dimensional surfaces used as ground truth against which the SSM fit was compared. For both approaches, the difference between the SSM-generated femur and the surface generated from MRI segmentation averaged less than 1.7 mm, with maximum errors occurring in less clinically important areas. The results demonstrated good correspondence with the distal femoral morphology even in cases of sparse datasets. Application of this technique will allow for measurement of mismatch between pre- and postoperative femurs retrospectively on any case done using the surgical navigation system and could be integrated into the surgical navigation unit to provide real-time feedback.	femur;ground truth;iteration;iterative closest point;knee replacement arthroplasty (procedure);matching;magnetic resonance imaging;mathematical morphology;mixture model;navigation;normal statistical distribution;patients;point cloud;proximity problems;real-time transcription;sparse matrix;statistical shape analysis;x-ray computed tomography	David A.

73ab780cabc7d9d6f9be7240881d2b79176e9f4a	retrospective correction of rigid and non-rigid mr motion artifacts using gans		Motion artifacts are a primary source of magnetic resonance (MR) image quality deterioration with strong repercussions on diagnostic performance. Currently, MR motion correction is carried out either prospectively, with the help of motion tracking systems, or retrospectively by mainly utilizing computationally expensive iterative algorithms. In this paper, we utilize a new adversarial framework, titled MedGAN, for the joint retrospective correction of rigid and non-rigid motion artifacts in different body regions and without the need for a reference image. MedGAN utilizes a unique combination of non-adversarial losses and a new generator architecture to capture the textures and fine-detailed structures of the desired artifact-free MR images. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons with other adversarial techniques have illustrated the proposed model performance.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;image quality;iteration;primary source;resonance;tracking system	Karim Armanious;Thomas Küstner;Konstantin Nikolaou;Sergios Gatidis;Bin Yang	2018	CoRR		image quality;pattern recognition;artificial intelligence;computer science;match moving	Vision	42.11133788389489	-83.66456050466748	35006

To produce realistic simulated data, we use variational (statistically-based) and vibrational (physically-based) spatial deformations, nonlinear radiometric warps mimicking imaging nonhomogeneity, and additive random noise with different underlying distributions.

Our method relies on the differences in the spatial characteristics of the absorption coefficient and the optical energy density within the medium. By using sparse-representation based decomposition, we exploit these different characteristics to extract both the absorption coefficient and the photon density within the imaged object from the optoacoustic image. In contrast to previous methods, this algorithm is not based on the solution of theoretical light transport equations and it does not require explicit knowledge of the illumination geometry or the optical properties of the object and other unknown or loosely defined experimental parameters, leading to highly robust performance. The method was successfully examined with numerically and experimentally generated data and was found to be ideally suited for practical implementations in tomographic schemes of varying complexity, including multiprojection illumination systems and multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) studies of tissue biomarkers.	algorithm;coefficient;experiment;multispectral image;multispectral optoacoustic tomography;numerical analysis;photons;quantitation;sparse matrix;tomographic reconstruction;whole body imaging	Amir Rosenthal;Daniel Razansky;Vasilis Ntziachristos	2009	IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging	10.1109/TMI.2009.2027116	computer vision;radiology;medicine;computer science;inverse problem;tomography;optics;physics	Vision	50.12662555117712	-81.26248465236714	35155

A user then i nteractively selects fracture-surface patches in pairs that coarsely correspond. A final optimization step is perfo rmed automatically to solve the N-body rigid alignment problem. The work represents the first example of a 3D bon e fracture reconstruction system and addresses two new problems unique to the reconstruction of fractured b ones : (1) non-stationary noise inherent in surfaces generated from a difficult segmentation problem and (2 ) the possibility that a single fracture surface on a fragment may correspond to many other fragments.	3d reconstruction;ct scan;mathematical optimization;n-body problem;semiconductor industry;stationary process	Andrew R.

This information stems from the observation that most volumes of a certain type, e.g., CT, MRI or flow simulation, contain occlusion patterns that reveal the spatial structure of their materials or features. Furthermore, these patterns appear to emerge consistently for different data sets of the same type. We call this collection of patterns the occlusion spectrum of a dataset. We show that using this occlusion spectrum leads to better two-dimensional transfer functions that can help classify complex data sets in terms of the spatial relationships among features. In general, the ambient occlusion of a voxel can be interpreted as a weighted average of the intensities in a spherical neighborhood around the voxel. Different weighting schemes determine the ability to separate structures of interest in the occlusion spectrum. We present a general methodology for finding such a weighting. We show results of our approach in 3D imaging for different applications, including brain and breast tumor detection and the visualization of turbulent flow.	ambient occlusion;clarity measurement;classification;clinical use template;coherence (physics);computation;computer graphics;cutaway drawing;experiment;graphics hardware;graphics processing unit;hidden surface determination;imagery;large;magnetic resonance imaging;mammary neoplasms;map;medical imaging;orchard;osirix;quantitation;silo (dataset);simulation;terascale (microarchitecture);transfer function;turbulence;uc browser;user interface device component;volume rendering;voxel	Carlos D.

21264906b35834a756352ce76122f8fedea7abb1	an mri myocarditis index defined by a pca-based object recognition algorithm	object recognition;medical diagnostics;magnetic resonance imaging;inflammation;matlab	Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has shown promising results in diagnosing myocarditis that can be qualitatively observed as enhanced pixels on the cardiac muscles images. In this paper, a myocarditis index, defined as the ratio between enhanced pixels, representing an inflammation, and the total pixels of myocardial muscle, is presented. In order to recognize and quantify enhanced pixels, a PCA-based recognition algorithm is used. The algorithm, implemented in Matlab, was tested by examining a group of 10 patients, referred to MRI with presumptive, clinical diagnosis of myocarditis. To assess intra- and interobserver variability, two observers blindly analyzed data related to the 10 patients by delimiting myocardial region and selecting enhanced pixels. After 5 days the same observers redid the analysis. The obtained myocarditis indexes were compared to an ordinal variable (values in the 1 - 5 range) that represented the blind assessment of myocarditis seriousness given by two radiologists on the base of the patient case histories. Results show that there is a significant correlation (P < 0:001; r = 0:94) between myocarditis indexes and the radiologists' clinical judgments. Furthermore, a good intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility was obtained. © (2015) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

It is used for the 3–D simulation of osteotomies of the facial and skull bones and for the prediction of soft–tissue changes caused by bone movement. The result of the simulation process is a 3–D, photorealistic model of the patient’s postoperative appearance that can be viewed from any position. The system is based on the individual preoperative bone structure of a patient’s skull derived from a computer tomography scan and on the patient’s photorealistic, preoperative appearance obtained by a laser scanner. The elasto–mechanical properties of the multi–layer soft–tissue are represented by springs. The model incorporates additional features such as skin turgor, gravity, and sliding bone contact. The prediction of soft–tissue deformation due to simulated bone movement is computed using an optimization approach. Several optimization methods have been tested and compared with regard to robustness of the simulation result and to computational costs. While the osteotomy simulation can be performed interactively, the computation of the corresponding soft–tissue changes usually takes less than 10 seconds even in sophisticated cases. Tests have been performed on a SGI O2 R10000, 175MHz. The system is able to simulate bimaxillary osteotomies, physiological jaw movement and has been used in the planning process in case of a craniosynostosis.	ct scan;computation;interactivity;mathematical optimization;r10000;simulation;skin (computing);tomography	Matthias Teschner;Sabine Girod;Bernd Girod	1999		10.1007/10704282_128	laser scanning;radiology;medicine;computed tomography;soft tissue;surgery;medical physics	Robotics	38.82994452333531	-85.24829965141555	35512

Human brain imaging with magnetic resonance at 7.0 Tesla (T) can reveal the brain’s architecture with resolution equivalent to that obtained from thin slices in vitro. In vivo images can provide tissue type identification with a greater clarity than that available in vitro without special stains. The coil design is an 8 or 12 channel phased array antenna tuned for 7.0T. The individual coils are arranged 8 or 12 loops in a ‘‘crown’’ configuration. Image acquisition is 6 minutes for 15 slices of 2 mm thickness with in-plane resolution of 0.25 mm using a gradient echo pulse sequence. While others have achieved good resolution in human brain imaging, this paper demonstrates a pulse sequence with a specialized radiofrequency coil that achieves an uniformity and resolution not shown in previous studies at 7.0T. Our new images demonstrate very fine details of the midbrain, brainstem, and hippocampal area that have not been previously achieved in living human subjects. VC 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The relevant anatomical structures for neck dissection planning can be segmented and the resulting patient-specific 3D-models are visualized afterwards in another software system for intervention planning. As a first step, we examined the appropriateness of elementary segmentation techniques based on gray values and contour information to extract the structures in the neck region from CT data. Region growing, interactive watershed transformation and live-wire are employed for segmentation of different target structures. It is also examined, which of the segmentation tasks can be automated. Based on this analysis, the software assistant NeckVision was developed to optimally support the workflow of image analysis for clinicians. The usability of NeckVision was tested within a first evaluation with four otorhinolaryngologists from the university hospital of Leipzig, four computer scientists from the university of Magdeburg and two laymen in both fields.	computer scientist;image analysis;magdeburg;norm (social);region growing;software system;usability;watershed (image processing);wizard (software)	Jeanette Cordes;Jana Dornheim;Bernhard Preim;Ilka Hertel;Gero Strauß	2006		10.1117/12.654157	computer vision;simulation;computer science;biological engineering	HCI	38.05072386339263	-84.54031372858321	35737

This software and hardware system offers real-time integration and registration of multiple image streams with localization data from navigation systems. All system components communicate over a local area Ethernet network, enabling rapid and flexible deployment configurations. As a representative configuration, we use X-ray fluoroscopy (XF) and ultrasound (US) imaging. The XF imaging system serves as the world coordinate system, with gantry geometry derived from the imaging system, and patient table position tracked with a custom-built measurement device using linear encoders. An electromagnetic (EM) tracking system is registered to the XF space using a custom imaging phantom that is also tracked by the EM system. The RMS fiducial registration error for the EM to X-ray registration was 2.19 mm, and the RMS target registration error measured with an EM-tracked catheter was 8.81 mm. The US image stream is subsequently registered to the XF coordinate system using EM tracking of the probe, following a calibration of the US image within the EM coordinate system. We present qualitative results of the system in operation, demonstrating the integration of live ultrasound imaging spatially registered to X-ray fluoroscopy with catheter localization using electromagnetic tracking.© (2007) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

However, it is relatively straightforward to obtain high quality segmentations in magnetic resonance (MR) images. In the context of MR to TRUS data fusion the information gathered in the MR images can hence provide a strong prior for US segmentation. In this paper, we describe a method to non-linearly register a patient specific mesh of the prostate build from MR images to TRUS volume. The MR prior provides shape and volume constraints that are used to guide the MR-to-TRUS surface deformation, in collaboration with a US image contour appearance model. The anatomical point correspondences between the MR and TRUS surfaces are obtained implicitly. The method was validated on 30 pairs of MR/TRUS patient exams and achieves a mean Dice value 0.85 and a mean surface error of 2.0 mm.	display resolution;medical ultrasound;resonance;signal-to-noise ratio	Sébastien Martin;Michael Baumann;Vincent Daanen;Jocelyne Troccaz	2010	2010 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro	10.1109/ISBI.2010.5490093	computer vision;radiology;medicine;shape;boundary value problem;computer science;image registration;magnetic resonance imaging;ultrasound;sensor fusion;accuracy and precision;image segmentation;image fusion;signal-to-noise ratio;segmentation;cancer;medical physics	Vision	42.32220055544063	-80.26488739736574	36099

These data present unique challenges to variability analysis due to the relatively low resolution of radiographs, and also due to minor variations from run to run which can result in misalignment or magnification changes between repeated measurements of a sample. Such positioning changes artificially inflate the variability of the data in ways that mask true physical phenomena. We present a novel Bayesian nonparametric regression model that incorporates both additive and multiplicative measurement error in addition to heteroscedasticity to address this problem. We use this model to assess the effects of sample thickness and sample position on measurement variability for an aluminum specimen.

e2a3b09f7f5def6f4931f1b81387c1acb5a33261	emg-based energy expenditure optimization for active prosthetic leg tuning		In recent years, active prosthetic legs have been developed and deployed commercially that help amputees to initiate gait with less effort and more symmetry in the pattern. However, the process of initial set up and tuning is highly time and cost consuming. It requires prosthetic experts to observe the gait and the feedback from amputees to manually tune the parameters subjectively. In this study, an electromyography (EMG)-based energy expenditure optimization method was presented to automatically tune the prosthetic limb. For this purpose, a wide variety of lower body muscles were observed and the energy expenditure was modeled based on their electrical activity. The tuning optimization was implemented based on a grid-searching protocol designed in this study. This method resulted in a power value comparable to manual tuning, which provided enough force to facilitate gait for amputees. This study shows the feasibility of automatic tuning and removal of the need for referral to an expert.	amputees;dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry;electromyography;energy metabolism;mathematical optimization;microscopy, energy-filtering transmission electron;muscle;patient referral;preparation;electrical activity	Roozbeh Atri;J.

In 1913, the first paper describing therapeutic uses of radium was published; in 1936, {sup 24}Na was administered as a therapy to a leukemia patient. Three years later, uptake of {sup 89}Sr was noted in bone metastases. During the 1940s, there was increasing use of iodine therapy for thyroid diseases, including thyroid cancer. Diagnostic {open_quotes}imaging{close_quotes} with radioisotopes was increasingly employed in the 1930s and 40s using probes and grew in importance and utility with the development of scintillation detectors with photorecording systems. Although coincidence counting to detect positron emissions was developed in 1953, the first medical center cyclotron was not installed until 1961. The 1960s saw the development of {sup 99m}Tc-labeled radiopharmaceuticals, emission reconstruction tomography [giving rise to single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET)], and {sup 64}Ga tumor imaging. Nuclear medicine was recognized as a medical specialty in 1971. Radiolabeled antibodies targeting human tumors in animals was reported in 1973; antibody tumor imaging in humans was reported in 1978. Technology has continued to advance, including the development of SPECT cameras with coincidencemore » detection able to perform FDG/PET imaging. With this overview as as backdrop, this paper focuses on the role of nuclear medicine in oncology from three perspectives: nonspecific tumor imaging agents, specific tumor imaging agents, and radioisotopes for tumor therapy. In summary, while tumor diagnosis and treatment were among the first uses explored for radioactivity, these areas have yet to reach their full potential.

This paper shows the possibilities of extended fluorescence lifetime evaluation and imaging in studying three-dimensional structures such as compartments of living cells with different fluorescence lifetimes. The method for quasi-FLIM image calculation is presented and image processing steps useful for biological experiments are suggested. The method was tested on isolated cardiomyocyte cells (CMs) and rat bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) labelled with SPIO-rhodamine nanoparticles and stained with standard fluorescent dyes.

An elasticity of a blood vessel on an eye fundus is lost according as the progression of arteriosclerosis. The elasticity can be evaluated by observing the beating of the blood vessel. We propose in this paper a method of a beat detection of blood vessel from SLO (Scanning Laser Opthalmoscope) eye fundus moving image. The proposed method consists of a blur correction and a vessel diameter evaluation. In the experiments, the beating of the blood vessel has been successfully detected from the SLO moving image.	beat detection	Kouki Yamada;Eiji Uchino;Noriaki Suetake;Reiji Kawata	2015		10.1016/j.procs.2015.08.159	computer vision	Vision	43.658269831236844	-85.66883102109534	37046

Localization of the capsule is a vital part of the system enabling physicians to identify the position of anomalies. Due to intestinal motility, the positions of the intestines will change significantly within the abdominal cavity over time. However, the distance from one position to another within the intestines changes much less. In this paper a method for calculating the pathlength travelled by a WCE is proposed. The method is based on Kalman-and particle filters and is simulated using a model that approximately replicates the movement through the small intestine. The travelled distance was estimated to an accuracy within a few millimeters.

Comparison of the 492-element Newton-Raphson algorithm with EIDORS open source tool (NOSER & GREIT algorithms), applied to a healthy volunteer, suggests that anatomically adjusted 3D models give better results. Nevertheless for phantom imaging an initial uniform image yields more accurate reconstructions. The results help in the selection and implementation of the reconstruction method for systems similar to IMPETOM.	3d modeling;approximation algorithm;characteristic impedance;eidors;electromagnetically induced transparency;imaging phantom;newton's method;nominal impedance;open-source software;tomography	Eduardo Santos;Franco Simini	2013	13th IEEE International Conference on BioInformatics and BioEngineering	10.1109/BIBE.2013.6701621	iterative reconstruction;computer vision;newton's method	Robotics	44.79639899127045	-84.39619528412244	37271

To retain the speaker’s facial expression, we substitute only the speech organ’s image with the synthesized one, which is made by a 3D wire-frame model that is adaptable to any speaker. Our approach provides translated image synthesis with an extremely small database. The tracking motion of the face from a video image is performed by template matching. In this system, the translation and rotation of the face are detected by using a 3D personal face model whose texture is captured from a video frame. We also propose a method to customize the personal face model by using our GUI tool. By combining these techniques and the translated voice synthesis technique, an automatic multimodal translation can be achieved that is suitable for video mail or automatic dubbing systems into other languages.	algorithm;central processing unit;cg (programming language);database;facial motion capture;graphical user interface;machine translation;mobile app;multimodal interaction;performance evaluation;real-time clock;rendering (computer graphics);speech recognition;speech synthesis;template matching;texture mapping;video email;video tracking;wire-frame model	Shigeo Morishima;Satoshi Nakamura	2004	EURASIP J.

Echocardiography provides a non-invasive, readily available method for generating real time images of the left ventricle. Two methods for myocardial deformation tracking that have been used are shape tracking and speckle tracking. These two methods provide complementary information. Shape tracking gives high accuracy on epi- and endocardial boundaries, with speckle tracking providing good displacements across the myocardium. The methods presented here combine the results of these two methods using multilevel radial basis functions. Ultrasound data was acquired on six canines, (three baseline and three post coronary occlusion). Calculated strain values showed significant differences between the baseline and post-occlusion datasets in the occluded regions, while the remote regions did not change much. For one baseline animal, comparison to tagged MRI strain values showed reasonable agreement.	baseline (configuration management);radial (radio);radial basis function	Colin B. Compas;Ben A.

For navigation and needle biopsy procedures it provides additional oblique slices from preoperative computed tomography (CT) volumes which are displayed with the corresponding endoscopic ultrasound (US) image. In contrast to similar systems an additional abdominal 3D ultrasound image is used to achieve the required registration. Two different approaches are compared: one method is based on direct inter-modal registration between abdominal 3D ultrasound and CT volume. The second method uses another 3D US scan taken preoperatively before the CT scan. Here, the CT is calibrated by means of an optical tracking system and the transformation between CT and the calibrated 3D US can be calculated without image registration. Before intervention, a pre-interventional 3D US is registered intra-modal to the preoperative US. This second method invoked to be the more robust and accurate procedure. For experimental studies a phantom has been developed which consists of a plastic tube inside a water tank. For error evaluation small plastic spheres have been fixed around the tube at different distances. First results give an overall error of 3.9 mm for the first method while the overall error for the intramodal method amounted to 3.1 mm.© (2011) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

8a8e03b1dc185546dbb6d58c778f8816c968859a	beyond current guided bronchoscopy: a robust and real-time bronchoscopic ultrasound navigation system		This paper develops a new bronchoscopic ultrasound navigation system that fuses multimodal sensory information including preoperative images, bronchoscopic video sequences, ultrasound images, and external position sensor measurements. To construct such a system, we must align these information coordinate systems. We use hand-eye calibration to align the video camera and its attached external sensor and introduce a phantom-free method to calibrate the ultrasonic probe and its fixed external sensor. More importantly, we propose a marker-free registration method that uses the bronchoscope and the bronchial tree center information to register the sensor and the pre-operative coordinate systems. We constructed a bronchial phantom to validate our system, whose navigation accuracy was about 2.6 mm. Furthermore, compared to the current navigated bronchoscopy, the main advantage of our system is that it navigates the bronchoscope and the ultrasonic mini probe simultaneously and provides bronchial structures inside and outside the bronchial walls, particularly lymph node structures in ultrasonic images.	align (company);anatomic node;bronchial tree;bronchoscopes;bronchoscopy;calibration;imaging phantom;information centers;lymph node tissue;multimodal interaction;navigation;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;real-time transcription;ultrasonics (sound);walls of a building;lymph nodes	Xióngbiao Luó;Kensaku Mori	2013	Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ...

In this paper, a numerical method to calculate the focus shift in multiple-layered tissues and a faster phase-correction method to restore the focus were developed. Data from the simulations showed that the focus shifted about 2 mm along the transducer axis in multiple-layered soft tissues. After phase correction, the focus was restored at the desired point. The ex vivo experiments were conducted to verify the simulations, and the results agreed well with those of the simulations. An empirical formula was obtained to estimate the focus shift in a two-layered water-tissue model and was verified by numerical calculations. Moreover, the focus shift in multiple-layered tissues can be summed by the shifts in the component of each layer of tissues. The factors affecting the focus shift were studied. The focus shift varied linearly with the tissue acoustic speed and tissue thickness, whereas it slightly changed with transducer F number (radius of curvature/diameter). Overall, the findings of this study can help in the development of a better treatment plan for FUS in soft tissues.	acoustic cryptanalysis;apache axis;axis vertebra;body tissue;diameter (qualifier value);experiment;focus (computing);focused ultrasound therapy;muscle;numerical method;porcine species;rule (guideline);simulation;soft tissue neoplasms;thickness (graph theory);transducer;ultrasonography;video-in video-out;anatomical layer;millimeter;pediatric intracranial germ cell brain tumor;tumor tissue	Dehui Li;Guofeng Shen;Jingfeng Bai;Yazhu Chen	2011	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2011.2106210	medicine;transducer;pathology;biological engineering;soft tissue;physics;surgery	Visualization	45.94113369460554	-84.97402581299013	37785

Biparietal diameter (BPD), occipital frontal diameter (OFD), and the head circumference (HC) are the most common parameters used for estimating the gestational age. Since the fetal head has an elliptical shape in the two dimensional image plane, extracting the ellipse and measuring the major axis (OFC), minor axis (BPD), and circumference (HC) are the task of image processing which will be discussed in this paper.

Significant cardiac and respiratory motion of the living subject, occasional spells of focal plane changes, drift in the field of view, and long image sequences are the principal roadblocks. The first step in such a registration process is the removal of translational and rotational motion. Next, a deformable registration can be performed. The focus of our study here is to remove the translation and/or rigid body motion that we refer to here as coarse alignment. The existing techniques for coarse alignment are unable to accommodate long sequences often consisting of periods of poor quality images (as quantified by a suitable perceptual measure). Many existing methods require the user to select an anchor image to which other images are registered. We propose a novel method for coarse image sequence alignment based on minimum weighted spanning trees (MISTICA) that overcomes these difficulties. The principal idea behind MISTICA is to reorder the images in shorter sequences, to demote nonconforming or poor quality images in the registration process, and to mitigate the error propagation. The anchor image is selected automatically making MISTICA completely automated. MISTICA is computationally efficient. It has a single tuning parameter that determines graph width, which can also be eliminated by the way of additional computation. MISTICA outperforms existing alignment methods when applied to microscopy image sequences of mouse arteries.	algorithmic efficiency;arterial system;atherosclerosis;computation (action);focal (programming language);file spanning;genetic translation process;intravital microscopy;minimum spanning tree;muscle rigidity;population parameter;propagation of uncertainty;sequence alignment;software propagation;trees (plant);video-in video-out;living subject;registration - actclass;width	Nilanjan Ray;Sara McArdle;Klaus Ley;Scott T.

The method is specifically designed for types of noise with uncorrelated fluctuations. Such signal fluctuations generally originate in the physical processes of imaging rather than in the tissue textures. Various types of noise (e.g., photon, electronics, and quantization) often contribute to degrade medical images; the overall noise is generally assumed to be additive with a zero-mean, constant-variance Gaussian distribution. However, statistical analysis suggests that the noise variance could be better modeled by a nonlinear function of the image intensity depending on external parameters related to the image acquisition protocol. We present a method to extract the relationship between an image intensity and the noise variance and to evaluate the corresponding parameters. The method was applied successfully to magnetic resonance images with different acquisition sequences and to several types of X-ray images.	acquisition protocol;algorithm;arabic numeral 0;assumed;autostereogram;ct scan;calibration;circuit restoration;cosmetics;diagnostic radiologic examination;drug or chemical tissue distribution;fits;grayscale;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;image noise;image restoration;judgment;least squares;least-squares analysis;medical imaging;noise reduction;nonlinear system;normal statistical distribution;performance;photons;physical phenomenon or property;quantization (signal processing);radiography;resonance;sample variance;seizures;sensor;standard deviation;test card;utility functions on indivisible goods;x-ray (amazon kindle)	Pierre Gravel;Gilles Beaudoin;Jacques A. de Guise	2004	IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging	10.1109/TMI.2004.832656	normal distribution;gradient noise;gaussian noise;median filter;image noise;additive white gaussian noise;computer vision;colors of noise;index term;value noise;image processing;computer science;noise measurement;magnetic resonance imaging;mathematics;white noise;stochastic resonance;statistics;salt-and-pepper noise	Vision	48.31148007663379	-83.28069371301667	38449

Morphological study of Lewy bodies is important to identify the causes and the processes of PD. Here, we investigate a possibility of phase contrast radiography using coherent synchrotron X-rays to explore the microscopic details of Lewy bodies in thick (approximately 3 mm) midbrain tissues. Autopsied midbrain tissues of a PD patient were sliced in 3 mm thickness and then examined using synchrotron X-rays from the 7B2 beamline of the Pohang Light Source. Refraction-enhanced phase contrast radiography and microtomography were adopted to identify dark core and dim edge of Lewy bodies in neurons. The morphology of Lewy bodies was clearly revealed by the phase contrast radiography in very thick (3 mm) midbrain tissues without any staining treatment. Three-dimensional volume rendered microtomography of the autopsied midbrain tissues demonstrates striking evidence that several Lewy bodies are agglomerated by dim edges in a neuron. We suggest that the phase contrast radiography could be a useful tool to morphologically investigate the causes or the processes in PD.	body tissue;coherence (physics);dopamine hydrochloride;dopaminergic neurons;entity name part qualifier - adopted;lewy bodies;lewy body disease;mathematical morphology;microscopy, phase-contrast;midbrain structure;neurodegenerative disorders;neuron;parkinson disease;parkinsonian disorders;patients;radiation;radiography;staining method;synchrotrons;thickness (graph theory);volume rendering;x-ray microtomography	Seong Beom Koh;S.

To build a full-view photoacoustic (PA) image, numbers of ultrasound sensors are needed to assure the image quality, which will bring difficulties to data acquisition and real-time image display. Compressed sensing (CS) theory breaks the restriction of Nyquist sampling theorem and is capable to rebuild sig- nals with less measurements. In this contribution, we proposed an optimization method to increase image quality of full-view PAT with less ultrasound sensors, which combines the theory of CS and a circularly distributing asymmetric data acquisition frame. The hardware cost can be saved and time efficiency of PAT can be raised without sacrificing the image quality. The feasibility of our proposed method is verified in simulation experiments which yield expected results. Our study might be helpful for clinical medical imaging such as early stage breast cancer detection, endoscopic imaging and in vivo monitoring.	compressed sensing;photoacoustic imaging;sensor;tomography	Meng Cao;Jie Yuan;Sidan Du;Guan Xu;Xueding Wang;Paul L.

574e665b4882da035f39cf8d21b1c7bc17018489	manufacture and characterization of breast tissue phantoms for emulating benign lesions		Phantoms elaboration has turned a very important field of study during the last decades due to its applications in medicine. These objects are capable of emulating or mimicking acoustically biological tissues in which parameters like speed of sound (SOS) and attenuation are successfully attained. However, these materials are expensive depending on their characteristics (USD $460.00 - $6000.00) and is difficult to have precise measurements because of their composition. This paper presents the elaboration and characterization of low cost (~ USD $25.00) breast phantoms which emulate histological normality and pathological conditions in order to support algorithm calibration procedures in imaging diagnosis. Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) was applied to estimate SOS and attenuation values for breast tissue (background) and benign lesions (fibroadenoma and cysts). Results showed values of the SOS and attenuation for the background between 1410 - 1450 m/s and 0.40 - 0.55 dB/cm at 1 MHz sampling frequency, respectively. On the other hand, the SOS obtained for the lesions ranges from 1350 to 1700 m/s and attenuation values between 0.50 - 1.80 dB/cm at 1 MHz. Finally, the fabricated phantoms allowed for obtaining ultrasonograms comparable with real ones whose acoustic parameters are in agree with those reported in the literature.	emulator	Julián A.

In this paper, a novel modeling framework for multilayered soft tissue deformation is proposed in order to facilitate the development of orthopedic surgery simulators. We construct our deformable model according to the layered structure of real human organs, and this results in a multilayered model. The division of layers is based on the segmented Chinese Visible Human (CVH) dataset. This enhances the realism and accuracy in the simulation. For the sake of efficiency, we employ 3D mass-spring system to our multilayered model. The nonlinear passive biomechanical properties of skin and skeletal muscle are achieved by introducing a bilinear elasticity scheme to the springs in the mass-spring system. To efficiently and accurately reproduce the biomechanical properties of certain human tissues, an optimization approach is employed in configuring the parameters of the springs. Experimental data from biomechanics literatures are used as benchmarking references. With the employment of Physics Processing Unit (PPU) and high quality volume visualization, our framework is developed into an interactive and intuitive platform for virtual surgery training systems. Several experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework in providing interactive and realistic deformation for orthopedic surgery simulation.	bibliographic reference;bilinear filtering;display resolution;elasticity (cloud computing);experiment;imagery;literature;mathematical optimization;natural springs;nonlinear system;organ;orthopedics;physics processing unit;scientific visualization;silo (dataset);simulation;simulators;skeletal muscle structure;surgery simulator;anatomical layer;human tissue;soft tissue	Jing Qin;Wai-Man Pang;Yim-Pan Chui;Tien-Tsin Wong;Pheng-Ann Heng	2008	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-008-9237-6	simulation;orthopedic surgery;effective mass;soft tissue;surgery	Robotics	36.44226173884993	-87.2301626793879	38938

In this work, we present a novel approach that uses a C-arm angiography system capable of computed tomography (CT)-like imaging (C-arm CT) for this purpose. With C-arm CT one reconstructed volume can be obtained every 4-6 s which makes it challenging to measure the flow of an injected contrast bolus. We have developed an interleaved scanning (IS) protocol that uses several scan sequences to increase temporal sampling. Using a dedicated 4-D reconstruction approach based on partial reconstruction interpolation (PRI) we can optimally process our data. We evaluated our combined approach (IS-PRI) with simulations and a study in five healthy pigs. In our simulations, the cerebral blood flow values (unit: ml/100 g/min) were 60 (healthy tissue) and 20 (pathological tissue). For one scan sequence the values were estimated with standard deviations of 14.3 and 2.9, respectively. For two interleaved sequences the standard deviations decreased to 3.6 and 1.5, respectively. We used perfusion CT to validate the in vivo results. With two interleaved sequences we achieved promising correlations ranging from r=0.63 to r=0.94. The results suggest that C-arm CT tissue perfusion imaging is feasible with two interleaved scan sequences.	bolus tracking;ct scan;cerebrovascular circulation;cerebrovascular accident;computer simulation;crew resource management, healthcare;decision making;detectors;epilepsies, partial;gram per minute;imaging techniques;interpolation imputation technique;maxima and minima;numerical analysis;patients;perfusion imaging;population parameter;radionuclide imaging;robot;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;spatial variability;units of measure - siemens;video-in video-out;x-ray computed tomography;x-ray image intensifier;algorithm;angiogram	Andreas Fieselmann;Arundhuti Ganguly;Yu Deuerling-Zheng;Michael Zellerhoff;Christopher Rohkohl;Jan M.

Traditionally, these studies have relied on manual evaluation, which is laborious, time consuming, and subject to large interobserver and intraobserver variability. A new technique, called active surface segmentation, alleviates these limitations and makes strides toward routine analyses. However, for three-dimensional (3-D) plaque assessment or 3-D reconstruction to become a clinical reality, methods must be developed which can analyze many images quickly. Presented is a comparison between two active surface techniques for three-dimensional segmentation of luminal and medial-adventitial borders. The force-acceleration technique and the neighborhood-search technique accurately detected both borders in vivo (r/sup 2/=0.95 and 0.99, Williams' index=0.67 and 0.65, and r/sup 2/=0.95 and 0.99, WI=0.67 and 0.70, respectively). However, the neighborhood-search technique was significantly faster and required less computation. Volume calculations for both techniques (r/sup 2/=0.99 and r/sup 2/=0.99) also agreed with a known-volume phantom. Active surface segmentation allows 3-D assessment of coronary morphology and further developments with this technology will provide clinical analysis tools.	anatomic structures;arteriopathic disease;blood vessel tissue;color gradient;computation;coronary artery disease;dental plaque;inter-rater reliability;intravascular ultrasound;mathematical morphology;medial graph;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;phenobarbital;senile plaques;spatial variability;video-in video-out;algorithm;biologic segmentation	Jon D.

Wall shear stress (WSS) is often used to evaluate flow impingement even though WSS and impinging force are in two different directions; therefore, this raises an important question of whether using WSS for evaluation of flow impingement size is appropriate. Flow impinging behavior in a patient-specific model of a giant aneurysm (GA) at the internal carotid artery (ICA) was analyzed by computational fluid dynamics simulations. An Impingement Index (IMI) was used to evaluate the timing and size of flow impingement. In theory, the IMI is related to the WSS gradient, which is known to affect vascular biology of endothelial cells. Effect of non-Newtonian fluid, aneurysm size, and heart rate were also studied. Maximum WSS is found to be proportional to the IMI, but the area of high wall shear is not proportional to the size of impingement. A faster heart rate or larger aneurysm does not produce a larger impinging site, and the Newtonian assumption overestimates the size of impingement. Flow impingement at the dome occurs approximately 0.11 s after the peak of flow waveform is attained. This time delay also increases with aneurysm size and varies with heart rate and waveform.	broadcast delay;carotid arteries;computational fluid dynamics;dome;giant bomb;giant cells;gradient;hydrodynamics;independent computing architecture;internal market information system;internal carotid artery structure;intracranial aneurysm;large;patients;simulation;software release life cycle;steam rupture;waveform;shear stress	Liang-Der Jou;Michel E.

Imaging of dynamic changes in blood parameters, functional brain imaging, and breast imaging are the most advanced areas of application of this novel technique. In this study we focus on difficulties that are encountered when OTI is employed for imaging tissues that contain fluid-filled regions. Examples of such tissues are the brain, which contains low scattering cerebrospinal fluids, joints, .which enclose translucent synovial fluids, and the maternal abdomen, which is filled with amniotic fluid. In these cases widely accepted image reconstruction schemes that rely on the diffusion approximation have limited applicability, and more advanced model-based iterative image reconstructions methods that make use of the equation of radiative transfer promise more accurate results.	approximation;iterative method;iterative reconstruction;medical imaging;modality (human–computer interaction);tomography	Andreas H.

The development of electrophysiological models will allow investigation of treatment strategies. However, current models are computationally expensive and often too complex to be adjusted with current clinical data. In this paper, we have proposed a fast algorithm to solve Eikonal-based models on triangular meshes. These models can be used to extract hidden parameters of the cardiac function from clinical data in a very short time, thus could be used during interventions. We propose a first approach to estimate these parameters, and have tested it on synthetic and real data derived using XMR imaging. We demonstrated a qualitative matching between the estimated parameter and XMR data. This novel approach opens up possibilities to directly integrate modelling in the interventional room.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;artificial cardiac pacemaker;electrophysiology (science);electrophysiology studies;estimation theory;fast multipole method;heart diseases;heart failure;interpolation imputation technique;kalman filter;matching;motion estimation;numerical analysis;orientation (graph theory);population parameter;real-time clock;simulation;solutions;synthetic data;synthetic intelligence;triangle mesh;triangulated irregular network;ventricular fibrillation;lapatinib;triangulation	Maxime Sermesant;Yves Coudière;Valérie Moreau-Villéger;Kawal S.

4913c432f909477086f725809997fb3bae1be133	development of a 3d ultrasound-guided system for thermal ablation of liver tumors	liver;transducers;liver cancer;abdomen;diagnostics;ultrasonography;radiation	Two-dimensional ultrasound (2D US) imaging is commonly used for diagnostic and intraoperative guidance of interventional abdominal procedures including percutaneous thermal ablation of focal liver tumors with radiofrequency (RF) or microwave (MW) induced energy. However, in many situations 2D US may not provide enough anatomical detail and guidance information. Therefore, intra-procedural CT or MR imaging are used in many centers for guidance purposes. These modalities are costly and are mainly utilized to confirm tool placement rather than guiding the insertion. Three-dimensional ultrasound (3D US) has been introduced to address these issues. In this paper, we present our integrated solution to provide 3D US images using a newly developed mechanical transducer with a large field-ofview and without the need for external tracking devices to combine diagnostic and planning information of different modalities for intraoperative guidance. The system provides tools to segment the target(s), plan the treatment, and detect the ablation applicators during the procedure for guiding purposes. We present experimental results used to ensure that our system generates accurate measurements and our early clinical evaluation results. The results suggest that 3D US used for focal liver ablation can provide a more reliable planning and guidance tool compared to 2D US only, and in many cases offers comparable measurements to other alternatives at significantly lower cost, faster time and with no harmful radiation. © (2013) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

0af7f6ede2f52230e7d9c3aacea8e91740d50d8f	improved human observer performance in digital reconstructed radiograph verification in head and neck cancer radiotherapy	igrt;quality assurance;setup error;image informatics;image guided radiotherapy	   Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) are routinely used as an a priori reference for setup correction in radiotherapy. The spatial resolution of DRRs may be improved to reduce setup error in fractionated radiotherapy treatment protocols. The influence of finer CT slice thickness reconstruction (STR) and resultant increased resolution DRRs on physician setup accuracy was prospectively evaluated.    Four head and neck patient CT-simulation images were acquired and used to create DRR cohorts by varying STRs at 0.5, 1, 2, 2.5, and 3 mm. DRRs were displaced relative to a fixed isocenter using 0–5 mm random shifts in the three cardinal axes. Physician observers reviewed DRRs of varying STRs and displacements and then aligned reference and test DRRs replicating daily KV imaging workflow. A total of 1,064 images were reviewed by four blinded physicians. Observer errors were analyzed using nonparametric statistics (Friedman’s test) to determine whether STR cohorts had detectably different displacement profiles. Post hoc bootstrap resampling was applied to evaluate potential generalizability.    The observer-based trial revealed a statistically significant difference between cohort means for observer displacement vector error ( $$p=0.02$$ p = 0.02 ) and for $$Z$$ Z -axis $$(p<0.01)$$ ( p < 0.01 ) . Bootstrap analysis suggests a 15 % gain in isocenter translational setup error with reduction of STR from 3 mm to $$\le $$ ≤ 2 mm, though interobserver variance was a larger feature than STR-associated measurement variance.    Higher resolution DRRs generated using finer CT scan STR resulted in improved observer performance at shift detection and could decrease operator-dependent geometric error. Ideally, CT STRs $$\le $$ ≤ 2 mm should be utilized for DRR generation in the head and neck.	alignment;blinded;ct scan;corneal pachymetry;deficit round robin;displacement mapping;genetic translation process;head and neck neoplasms;head and neck structure;hoc (programming language);image slice thickness;large;patients;plain x-ray;preparation;protocols documentation;psychologic displacement;radiography;resampling (statistics);resultant;sample variance;simulation;statistics, nonparametric;step detection;test case;therapeutic radiology procedure;thickness (graph theory);verification of theories	Jared D.

The proposed approach is based on mathematical tumor growth models using the reaction-diffusion formalism. The quantification process is formulated by an inverse problem and solved using anisotropic fast marching method yielding an efficient algorithm.

The purpose of the present work is to investigate optimization methods that can be used to fit that model to actual recorded LFPs. For that, we utilize data derived from seven parkinsonian subjects prior to the permanent implantation of the deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrode. For the fitting, five optimization methods are used, combined with two methods for estimating the error between the actual recorded and the model predicted LFP signals in the frequency domain. The procedures are focused on re-generating the characteristic beta peak of the ST LFP. The results indicate that the model is able to reproduce the beta peak in various frequencies in the range of both low and high beta, while at the same time, the values of the critical parameters bringing the model in that area of behavior reveal the crucial role of the synaptic strengths in Parkinsonpsilas disease pathophysiology.	basal (phylogenetics);curve fitting;deep brain stimulation;direct-broadcast satellite;ganglia;international conference on functional programming;ion implantation;least fixed point;mathematical optimization;super-twisted nematic display;synaptic package manager	George L.

Consequently, we have developed a parallelized partial volume reconstruction approach to overcome this limitation. In this paper, we report results from experiments conducted on breast phantoms and human volunteers to validate the proposed technique. More specifically, we demonstrate that computational cost is linearly related to the number of subzones used during image recovery and that both subzone parallelization and partial volume domain reduction decrease execution time accordingly. Importantly, elastograms computed based on the parallelized partial volume technique are not degraded in terms of either image quality or accuracy relative to their full volume counterparts provided that the estimation domain is sufficiently large to negate the effects of boundary conditions. The clinical results presented in this paper are clearly preliminary; however, the parallelized partial volume reconstruction approach performs sufficiently well to warrant more in-depth clinical evaluation.	algorithmic efficiency;computation;computer;computers;experiment;image quality;magnetic resonance elastography;modulus robot;nonlinear system;parallel computing;phantoms, imaging;run time (program lifecycle phase);specimen volume:vol:pt:semin plas:qn	Marvin M.

While a large number of approaches to recover the intra-voxel fiber structure have been utilized in the scientific community, a direct, 3D, quantitative validation of these methods against relevant histological fiber geometries is lacking. In this study, we investigate how well different high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) models and reconstruction methods predict the ground-truth histologically defined fiber orientation distribution (FOD), as well as investigate their behavior over a range of physical and experimental conditions. The dMRI methods tested include constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD), Q-ball imaging (QBI), diffusion orientation transform (DOT), persistent angular structure (PAS), and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) methods. Evaluation criteria focus on overall agreement in FOD shape, correct assessment of the number of fiber populations, and angular accuracy in orientation. In addition, we make comparisons of the histological orientation dispersion with the fiber spread determined from the dMRI methods. As a general result, no HARDI method outperformed others in all quality criteria, with many showing tradeoffs in reconstruction accuracy. All reconstruction techniques describe the overall continuous angular structure of the histological FOD quite well, with good to moderate correlation (median angular correlation coefficient > 0.70) in both single- and multiple-fiber voxels. However, no method is consistently successful at extracting discrete measures of the number and orientations of FOD peaks. The major inaccuracies of all techniques tend to be in extracting local maxima of the FOD, resulting in either false positive or false negative peaks. Median angular errors are ∼10° for the primary fiber direction and ∼20° for the secondary fiber, if present. For most methods, these results did not vary strongly over a wide range of acquisition parameters (number of diffusion weighting directions and b value). Regardless of acquisition parameters, all methods show improved successes at resolving multiple fiber compartments in a voxel when fiber populations cross at near-orthogonal angles, with no method adequately capturing low to moderate angle (<60°) crossing fibers. Finally, most methods are limited in their ability to capture orientation dispersion, resulting in low to moderate, yet statistically significant, correlation with histologically-derived dispersion with both HARDI and NODDI methodologies. Together, these results provide quantitative measures of the reliability and limitations of dMRI reconstruction methods and can be used to identify relative advantages of competing approaches as well as potential strategies for improving accuracy.	anatomical compartments;angularjs;cambridge structural database;coefficient;deconvolution;diffusion anisotropy;diffusion magnetic resonance imaging;maxima and minima;population;spherical power:invlen:pt:eye.left:qn;tissue fiber;voxel	Kurt G.

In this study, a novel finite-element-based algorithm for FMT of heterogeneous media is proposed. In the algorithm, optical properties are reconstructed using the conjugate gradient method. A modified method based on reverse differential scheme is deduced for calculating the gradient when the detector points are not restricted on boundary nodes. With the recovered optical properties, linear relationship between known surface measurements of emission light and unknown fluorescence yield is then obtained. FMT reconstruction is implemented by combining algebraic reconstruction technique (ART) and Landweber iteration method. With initial value provided by ART, Landweber iteration method improves the quantification smoothly with small step length between neighboring iterations. The algorithm was evaluated using phantoms of different heterogeneity configurations. Results show that the reconstructed fluorescence yield is insensitive to various degrees of heterogeneity for the proposed algorithm. In contrast, when assuming homogeneous optical properties, it shows that more underestimation of optical properties results in more underestimation of the reconstructed fluorescence yield. Fast computation speed of the proposed algorithm is also demonstrated in this study.	algebraic reconstruction technique;computation (action);conjugate gradient method;detectors;fecal microbiota transplantation;fluorescence;genetic heterogeneity;image quality;immunostimulating conjugate (antigen);landweber iteration;linear algebra;phantoms, imaging;quantitation;smoothing;x-ray computed tomography;algorithm	Daifa Wang;Xin Liu;Yanping Chen;Jing Bai	2009	IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine	10.1109/TITB.2009.2015144	mathematical optimization;radiology;finite element method;mathematics;tomography;quantum mechanics	Visualization	47.30413919685476	-84.42488451592816	40645

Retinal prostheses offer vision restoration via electrode implantation and stimulation near the fovea, thereby eliciting articifial percepts, so-called phosphenes in the center VF. Although foveal photoreceptors can persist for prolonged periods of time, bionic therapy is usually restricted to stages of RP with complete vision loss. However, persons with RP experience mobility impairment from peripherally restricted VFs much earlier. Consequently, the amount of visual scanning necessary for navigation is increased, and maintaining a steady pace is challenging. Receiving a retinal implant at this early stage might be feasible. We investigated the potential of a peripheral visual prosthesis coexisting with central residual vision to facilitate scene perception and mobility. Simulating prosthetic and residual vision in a virtual mobility environment, we found that assistive phosphene layouts were associated with reductions in visual scanning-related head movements of up to 42.1%, body rotations of up to 30%, and up to 45% lower frequency of stopping when circumventing low-lying obstacles, pedestrians and following a path. Further research on early implantation of retinal prostheses for the peripheral VF is therefore advised.	accommodation phosphene disorder;bionics;circuit restoration;correction of hearing impairment;hiv enteropathy;head and neck neoplasms;ion implantation;limited stage (cancer stage);movement;peripheral vascular diseases;photoreceptors;rp (complexity);retina;retinal implant;retinitis pigmentosa;simulation;structure of fovea centralis;telling untruths;unspecified visual loss;virtual reality;visual prosthesis;vision aids	Marc Patrick H.

One of the major problems of magnetic resonance coronary angiography (MRCA) is the effective suppression of coronary motion due to respiration and cardiac contraction. To compensate for cardiac movement, data acquisition is generally limited to the coronary artery rest period mainly found during end-diastole. End-diastole is called cardiac rest period. Generally, cardiac rest period is decided by operator. Therefore it is subjective, and requires many experiences. As for setting region of interest right coronary is known as an appropriate region for determining cardiac rest period. We proposed a method that is based on the extraction of intensive change regions and the calculation of the correlation coefficient. We tested the algorithm for two sets of clinical MR images and the results are shown.© (2009) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

It is a highly lethal cancer of sympathetic nervous system that commonly affects children of age five or younger. It accounts for a disproportionate number of childhood cancer deaths and remains a difficult cancer to eradicate despite intensive treatment that includes chemotherapy, surgery, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, radiation therapy and immunotherapy. A poorly characterized group of patients are the 15% with primary refractory neuroblastoma (PRN) which is uniformly lethal due to de novo chemotherapy resistance. The lack of response to therapy is currently assessed after multiple months of cytotoxic therapy, driving the critical need to develop pretreatment clinic-biological biomarkers that can guide precise and effective therapeutic strategies. Therefore, our guiding hypothesis is that PRN has distinct biological features present at diagnosis that can be identified for prediction modeling. During a visual analysis of PRN slides, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, we observed that patients who survived for less than three years contained large eosin-stained structures as compared to those who survived for greater than three years. So, our hypothesis is that the size of eosin stained structures can be used as a differentiating feature to characterize recurrence in neuroblastoma. To test this hypothesis, we developed an image analysis method that performs stain separation, followed by the detection of large structures stained with Eosin. On a set of 21 PRN slides, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, our image analysis method predicted the outcome with 85.7% accuracy. © (2015) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

0259b974c4b8f3c813af6213839af990f00254ae	improved multi b-value diffusion-weighted mri of the body by simultaneous model estimation and image reconstruction (smeir)	sensitivity and specificity;whole body imaging;image enhancement;image interpretation computer assisted;reproducibility of results;algorithms;humans;kidney;crohn disease;diffusion magnetic resonance imaging	Diffusion-weighted MRI images acquired with multiple b-values have the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy by increasing the conspicuity of lesions and inflammatory activity with background suppression. Unfortunately, the inherently low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of DW-MRI reduces enthusiasm for using these images for diagnostic purposes. Moreover, lengthy acquisition times limit our ability to improve the quality of multi b-value DW-MRI images by multiple excitations acquisition and signal averaging at each b-value. To offset these limitations, we propose the Simultaneous Model Estimation and Image Reconstruction (SMEIR) for DW-MRI, which substantially improves the quality of multi b-value DW-MRI images without increasing acquisition times. Our model introduces the physiological signal decay model of DW-MRI as a constraint in the reconstruction of the DW-MRI images. An in-vivo experiment using 6 low-quality DW-MRI datasets of a healthy subject showed that SMEIR reconstruction of low-quality data improved SNR by 55% in the liver and by 41% in the kidney without increasing acquisition times. We also demonstrated the clinical impact of our SMEIR reconstruction by increasing the conspicuity of inflamed bowel regions in DW-MRI of 12 patients with Crohn's disease. The contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the inflamed regions in the SMEIR images was higher by 12.6% relative to CNR in the original DW-MRI images.	contrast-to-noise ratio;crohn disease;digimon world;dreamwidth;expectation–maximization algorithm;experiment;image quality;intestines;iterative reconstruction;license;numerous;patients;renal tissue;signal averaging;signal-to-noise ratio;video-in video-out;zero suppression	Moti Freiman;Onur Afacan;Robert V.

The difference in angles causes shadow exchange between two images, which is difficult to handle precisely by the conventional position alignment procedure using nonlinear deformation. We developed a novel alignment procedure for each depth which was inspired by the fact that the position of the shadow on the X-ray image depends on the 3D depth (distance from the X-ray source) of the tissue which corresponds to the shadow. In this paper, the results of applying the proposed method to X-ray images taken from a chest phantom and an actual human body are presented and the effectiveness of the method is discussed. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Modalities were chosen to closely model the current clinical interest in correlation of MRI and FDG-PET imaging. An automatic 2D-registration algorithm that takes into account variations in sample orientation and shearing has been developed for accurate alignment of brain slices. It uses a multivariate optimization algorithm on the peak correlation between the gradient filtered autoradiograph image and the corresponding video image of the specimen's block face. Registration of the reconstructed 2DG-autoradiography volume data with 3D reconstructed in vivo multislice MRI of rat brains was accomplished with a 3D registration algorithm utilizing user identified homologous feature pairs consisting of points, line segments, and planar patches.

The algorithm is based on a deformable model, and allows the user to initialize the model by combining and molding primitive shapes such as cylinders and spheres to form an initial approximate model of the organ surface. The initial model is automatically deformed to better fit organ boundaries. The algorithm was applied to segment the carotid bifurcation from 3D black blood magnetic resonance (MR) images of 5 subjects. The algorithm-segmented surfaces were compared to surfaces segmented manually by an experienced user. On average, approximately 3 min were required to segment an image using the algorithm, whereas 1h was required for manual segmentation. The average distance between corresponding points on the manually and algorithm-segmented surfaces was 0.37 mm, whereas the average maximum distance was 2.03 mm. Moreover, algorithm-segmented surfaces exhibited less intra-operator variability than those segmented manually.		Yuan Jin;Hanif M.

1d25e276b20c2c7853bf464305dfedd96871389e	joint registration and parameter estimation of t1 relaxation times using variable flip angles		Accurate and fast estimation of T1 relaxation times is a crucial ingredient for many applications in magnetic resonance imag- ing (1). A fast way for T1 estimation is a model-based reconstruction from data obtained with variable flip angles as proposed in (2). How- ever, this technique requires multiple measurements thus patient move- ment can degrade the results. In this work we introduce a novel model which combines registration and T1 estimation. A discretization of the new approach is given, including a tailored optimization algorithm. The novel method is compared to conventional reconstruction techniques on 2D software phantom data. With the new method it was possible to improve the relative error in T1 maps from 0.4253 to 0.4049 using the novel algorithm.	estimation theory;linear programming relaxation	Constantin Heck;Martin Benning;Jan Modersitzki	2015		10.1007/978-3-662-46224-9_38	mathematical optimization;simulation;mathematics;engineering drawing	Vision	45.08206998545955	-81.49752971716715	40895

Failure of the spinal pedicle screws including breakage and loosening may jeopardize the fixation integrity and lead to treatment failure. Two important design objectives, bending strength and pullout strength, may conflict with each other and warrant a multiobjective optimization study. In the present study using the three-dimensional finite element (FE) analytical results based on an L25 orthogonal array, bending and pullout objective functions were developed by an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm, and the trade-off solutions known as Pareto optima were explored by a genetic algorithm (GA). The results showed that the knee solutions of the Pareto fronts with both high bending and pullout strength ranged from 92% to 94% of their maxima, respectively. In mechanical validation, the results of mathematical analyses were closely related to those of experimental tests with a correlation coefficient of -0.91 for bending and 0.93 for pullout (P < 0.01 for both). The optimal design had significantly higher fatigue life (P < 0.01) and comparable pullout strength as compared with commercial screws. Multiobjective optimization study of spinal pedicle screws using the hybrid of ANN and GA could achieve an ideal with high bending and pullout performances simultaneously.	artificial neural network;bending - changing basic body position;coefficient;decompression sickness;fatigue;finite element method;fracture;genetic algorithm;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;mathematics;maxima;multi-objective optimization;optimal design;pareto efficiency;pedicle screws;performance;protein array analysis;screw;software release life cycle;solutions;dendritic spine neck	Yongyut Amaritsakul;Ching-Kong Chao;Jinn Lin	2013		10.1155/2013/462875	computer science;finite element method;mathematics;algorithm	HCI	28.684936927940615	-84.62504395237116	40903

However, despite it now being possible to acquire high-resolution data with state-of-the-art fluorescence microscopy, such as lightsheet microscopy, most data interpretation in pre-clinical neurovascular research relies on visual subjective judgement, rather than objective quantification. Therefore, we describe the development of an image analysis workflow towards the quantification and description of zebrafish neurovascular development. In this paper we focus on data acquisition by lightsheet fluorescence microscopy, data properties, image pre-processing, and vasculature segmentation, and propose future work to derive quantifications of zebrafish neurovasculature development.	data acquisition;holographic interference microscopy;image analysis;image resolution;preprocessor;video-in video-out	Elisabeth Kugler;Timothy Chico;Paul A.

2350dd4d0f209a7547136dcac06ef0deff668fb0	refinement of clinical x-ray computed tomography (ct) scans containing metal implants	ct;metal artefact reduction;metal artefact reduction ct image artefacts reconstruction;reconstruction;report;image artefacts;article	X-ray computed tomography (CT) data contains artefacts from many sources, with sufficient prominence to affect diagnostic utility when metal is present in the scans. These artefacts can be reduced, usually by the removal and in-filling of any sinogram data which has been affected by metal, and several such techniques have been proposed. Most of them are prone to introducing new artefacts into the CT data or may take a long time to correct the data. It is the purpose of this paper to introduce a new technique which is fast, yet can effectively remove most artefacts without introducing significant new ones. The new metal artefact reduction technique (RMAR) consists of an iterative refinement of the CT data by alternately forward- and back-projecting the part of the reconstruction near to metal. The forward-projection is corrected by making use of a prior derived from the reconstructed data which is independently estimated for each projection angle, and smoothed using a newly developed Bitonic filter. The new technique is compared with previously published (LI, NMAR, MDT) and commercial (O-MAR, IMAR) alternatives, quantitatively on phantom data, and qualitatively on a selection of clinical scans, mostly of the hip. The phantom data is from two recently published studies, enabling direct comparison with previous results. The results show an increased reduction of artefacts on the four phantom data sets tested. On two of the phantom data sets, RMAR is significantly better (p<0.001) than all other techniques; on one it is as good as any other technique, and on the last it is only beaten by the Metal Deletion Technique (p<0.001), which is significantly slower. On the clinical data sets, RMAR shows visually similar performance to MDT, with better preservation of bony features close to metal implants, but perhaps slightly reduced homogeneity in the far field. For typical CT data, RMAR can correct each image in 3-8s, which is more than one hundred times faster than MDT. The new technique is demonstrated to have performance at least as good as MDT, with both out-performing other approaches. However, it is much faster then the latter technique, and shows better preservation of data very close to metal.	arabic numeral 100;biologic preservation;close to metal;diagnostic radiologic examination;imaging phantom;iterative method;iterative refinement;lithium;model-based testing;morphologic artifacts;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;plain x-ray;procedure implants:finding:point in time:^patient:narrative;reconstructive surgical procedures;refinement (computing);scanning;scientific publication;smoothing (statistical technique);supernumerary maxillary right central incisor;x-ray computed tomography	Graham M.

The device consists of a pump that pumps blood from the left ventricle into the aorta. To get the correct rotation speed of the pump, the physicians consider a number of measurements as well as a sequence of echocardiographic images. The important information obtained from the images is the shape of the inter-ventricular septum. For instance, if the septum bulges towards the left ventricle the speed is too high and it might harm the right ventricular function. To get a measure of the shape of the septum, which can be incorporated in a decision support system, we perform a segmentation of the septum using a shortest path method. To reduce user interaction, the user only needs to annotate two anchor points in the first frame. They mark the endpoints of the septum and they are tracked through the sequence with our tracking algorithm. After the segmentation the septum is divided into two regions, the one closest to the right ventricle and the one closest to the left ventricle, and the desired measure is the difference between the areas of these regions divided by the total septum area. The performance of the segmentation algorithm is acceptable and the obtained septum measure corresponds in most cases to the assessments from a physician.	algorithm;decision support system;failure;shortest path problem	Matilda Landgren;Niels Chr.

Tagged MRI is currently considered as the gold standard for myocardial strain mapping in vivo. However, despite the low SNR nature of ultrasound signals, echocardiography enjoys the widespread availability in the clinic, as well as its low cost and high temporal resolution. Comparing the strain estimation performances of the two techniques has been of great interests to the community. In order to assess the cardiac deformation across different imaging modalities, in this paper, we developed a semi-automatic intensity and gradient based registration framework that rigidly registers the 3D tagged MRIs with the 2D ultrasound images. Based on the two registered modalities, we conducted spatially and temporally more detailed quantitative strain comparison of the RF-based UME technique and tagged MRI. From the experimental results, we conclude that qualitatively the two modalities share similar overall trends. But error and variations in UME accumulate over time. Quantitatively tMRI is more robust and accurate than UME.	cardiomyopathies;echocardiography;elastography;estimated;gradient;gradient;infarction;leukemia, myelocytic, acute;myocardium;patients;performance;preclinical imaging;quantitation;radio frequency;registration;resonance;semiconductor industry;signal-to-noise ratio;tracer;video-in video-out;quantitative	Zhen Qian;Wei-Ning Lee;Elisa E.

Currently, the system is targeted at the Siemens High Resolution Research Tomograph (HRRT) PET scanner. Partial face surfaces are reconstructed using a miniaturized structured light system. The reconstructed 3D point clouds are matched to a reference surface using a robust iterative closest point algorithm. A main challenge is the narrow geometry requiring a compact structured light system and an oblique angle of observation. The system is validated using a mannequin head mounted on a rotary stage. We compare the system to a standard optical motion tracker based on a rigid tracking tool. Our system achieves an angular RMSE of 0.11 degrees demonstrating its relevance for motion compensated 3D scan image reconstructions as well as its competitiveness against the standard optical system with an RMSE of 0.08 degrees. Finally, we demonstrate qualitative result on real face motion estimation.	algorithm;angularjs;cns disorder;iterative closest point;iterative method;manikins;motion detector;motion estimation;muscle rigidity;oblique projection;patients;point cloud;reference surface;relevance;rotary woofer;scanner device component;spaces;structured light;tomography;tracking system;units of measure - siemens	Oline Vinter Olesen;Rasmus R.

The macro model for the circulatory system is composed of modules for physiological functions such as neural activity, hormonal adjustment, and body temperature control, and provides a mathematical representation of comprehensive knowledge of systemic circulation physiology. The micro model of the circulatory system, on the other hand, uses differential equations to describe hemodynamics with the heart as a pump, and calculates the systemic hemodynamics produced by heart pulsations in millisecond time steps. An electrical circuit model is constructed for the systemic and pulmonary circulatory systems, in which the time-varying elasticity of the ventricular muscle corresponds to a variable capacitor. By connecting the macro and micro models through common variables, a simulation which combines macroscopic and microscopic hemodynamics is produced, making it possible to investigate the response of the pulsatile blood flow as various parameter values of the whole circulation system are varied. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This can be difficult because healthy and diseased tissue can have the same visual appearance. To this aim, and because the surgeon cannot see underneath the brain surface, image-guided neurosurgery systems are being increasingly used. However, during surgery, deformation of the brain occurs (due to brain shift and tumor resection), therefore causing errors in the surgical planning with respect to preoperative imaging. In our previous work, we developed software for capturing the deformation of the brain during neurosurgery. The software also allows preoperative data to be updated according to the intraoperative imaging so as to reflect the shape changes of the brain during surgery. Our goal in this paper was to rapidly visualize and characterize this deformation over the course of surgery with appropriate tools. Therefore, we developed tools allowing the doctor to visualize (in 2D and 3D) deformations, as well as the stress tensors characterizing the deformation along with the updated preoperative and intraoperative imaging during the course of surgery. Such tools significantly add to the value of intraoperative imaging and hence could improve surgical outcomes.© (2001) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

Fourteen discriminators obtained by partial least squares regression performed on difference spectra from 20 independent infection experiments were examined. Sorting the FTIR absorbance of the five best discriminators and dividing them into equal intervals gave an accuracy of 92%. This constitutes proof of concept at 6 hours post exposure for discriminating two infections from each other and from Mock infected cells. When the PLSR model was combined with a 14×7×3 artificial neural network, the best sensitivity and accuracy were obtained with the neural network trained to an RMS error of 0.100 within 400,000 iterations. The sensitivities were Mock = 80%, HSV1 = 90% and Coxsackievirus = 70%, for an overall accuracy of 80% based on 10 Mock, 10 HSV1 and 10 Coxsackievirus test samples.	artificial neural network;experiment;iteration;mock object;partial least squares regression;sorting	John A.

b823adb0f7d04d455a4a1bd22ad789e97a31e66e	fast and simple automatic 3d ultrasound probe calibration based on 3d printed phantom and an untracked marker		Tracking the pose of an ultrasound (US) probe is essential for an intraoperative US-based navigation system. The tracking requires mounting a marker on the US probe and calibrating the probe. The goal of the US probe calibration is to determine the rigid transformation between the coordinate system (CS) of the image and the CS of the marker mounted on the probe. We present a fast and automatic calibration method based on a 3D printed phantom and an untracked marker for three-dimensional (3D) US probe calibration. To simplify the conventional calibration procedures using and tracking at least two markers, we used only one marker and did not track it in the whole calibration process.

For the analysis of the cortical surface, mapping of functional information on to the cortex or visualization, it is necessary to remove the outer surfaces of the brain. For intersubject comparison, it is useful to align the dataset with a coordinate system and introduce a spatial normalization. We describe an image processing chain that combines all of these steps in an interaction-free procedure. We report on a period of 2 years of routine application of this procedure, with >250 successfully processed datasets from healthy subjects and patients with various forms of brain damage.	align (company);brain injuries;image processing;image resolution;patients;resonance;silo (dataset)	Frithjof Kruggel;D.

For tract-based comparison of a population of images, a common approach is to first generate an atlas by averaging, after spatial normalization, all images in the population, and then perform tractography using the constructed atlas. The reconstructed fiber trajectories form a common geometry onto which diffusion properties of each individual subject can be projected based on the corresponding locations in the subject native space. However, in the case of high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI), where modeling fiber crossings is an important goal, the above-mentioned averaging method for generating an atlas results in significant error in the estimation of local fiber orientations and causes a major loss of fiber crossings. These limitatitons have significant impact on the accuracy of the reconstructed fiber trajectories and jeopardize subsequent tract-based analysis. As a remedy, we present in this paper a more effective means of performing tractography at a population level. Our method entails determining a bipolar Watson distribution at each voxel location based on information given by all images in the population, giving us not only the local principal orientations of the fiber pathways, but also confidence levels of how reliable these orientations are across subjects. The distribution field is then fed as an input to a probabilistic tractography framework for reconstructing a set of fiber trajectories that are consistent across all images in the population. We observe that the proposed method, called PopTract, results in significantly better preservation of fiber crossings, and hence yields better trajectory reconstruction in the atlas space.	angularjs;atlases;biologic preservation;bipolar disorder;cervical atlas;diffusion anisotropy;electronic circuit;mental orientation;projections and predictions;tissue fiber;tract (literature);video-in video-out;voxel;white matter	Pew-Thian Yap;John H.

These tensors are symmetric positive definite matrices and the appropriate constraints required in algorithms for processing them makes these algorithms complex and significantly increases their computational complexity. In this paper we present a novel parameterization of the diffusivity function using which the positive definite property of the function is guaranteed without any increase in computation. This parameterization can be used for any order tensor approximations; we present Cartesian tensor approximations of order 2, 4, 6 and 8 respectively, of the diffusivity function all of which retain the positivity property in this parameterization without the need for any explicit enforcement. Furthermore, we present an efficient framework for computing distances and geodesies in the space of the coefficients of our proposed diffusivity function. Distances & geodesies are useful for performing interpolation, computation of statistics etc. on high rank positive definite tensors.

We have been developing an endoscopic robot system that performs surgery on the gastric tubes. The system has two manipulators on both sides of the endoscope's tip. Using these manipulators, surgeons are able to perform surgical procedures like open surgery. We applied a data fusion system to the endoscopic robot system for an image-guided surgery. The data fusion system uses two devices; a magnetic 3D location sensor and a Graphic workstation. The magnetic location sensor is attached to the endoscope's tip and measures the 3D position and direction of the tip. The graphic workstation (GWS) transforms a coordinate system of a 3D patient's organ model by using the sensor's data, and superimposes the organ model onto the captured image of the endoscope in real time. We used this system during an endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) of a pig. At this experiment, the surgeon was able to observe the inner structure of the animal's organ.

Key requirement is the availability of 2D-3D registration techniques that can deal with non-rigid motion and deformation. Image guidance for TECAB is mainly required before the mechanical stabilisation of the heart, when the most dominant source of misregistration is the deformation and non-rigid motion of the heart. To augment the images in the endoscope of the da Vinci robot, we have to find the transformation from the coordinate system of the preoperative imaging modality to the system of the endoscopic cameras. In a first step we build a 4D motion model of the beating heart. Intraoperatively we can use the ECG or video processing to determine the phase of the cardiac cycle, as well as the heart and respiratory frequencies. We then take the heart surface from the motion model and register it to the stereo endoscopic images of the da Vinci robot resp. of a validation system using photo-consistency. To take advantage of the fact that there is a whole image sequence available for registration, we use the different phases together to get the registration. We found the similarity function to be much smoother when using more phases. This also showed promising behaviour in convergence tests. Images of the vessels available in the preoperative coordinate system can then be transformed to the camera system and projected into the calibrated endoscope view using two video mixers with chroma keying. It is hoped that the augmented view can improve the efficiency of TECAB surgery and reduce the conversion rate to more conventional procedures.		Michael Figl;Daniel Rueckert;David J.

Recently, there has been an explosion in the amount of data being stored on patients who suffer from visual deterioration, including visual field (VF) test, retinal image, and frequent intraocular pressure measurements. Like the progression of many biological and medical processes, VF progression is inherently temporal in nature. However, many datasets associated with the study of such processes are often cross sectional and the time dimension is not measured due to the expensive nature of such studies. In this paper, we address this issue by developing a method to build artificial time series, which we call pseudo time series from cross-sectional data. This involves building trajectories through all of the data that can then, in turn, be used to build temporal models for forecasting (which would otherwise be impossible without longitudinal data). Glaucoma, like many diseases, is a family of conditions and it is, therefore, likely that there will be a number of key trajectories that are important in understanding the disease. In order to deal with such situations, we extend the idea of pseudo time series by using resampling techniques to build multiple sequences prior to model building. This approach naturally handles outliers and multiple possible disease trajectories. We demonstrate some key properties of our approach on synthetic data and present very promising results on VF data for predicting glaucoma.	area striata structure;color gradient;cross-sectional data;disorder of eye;glaucoma;patients;projections and predictions;pseudo brand of pseudoephedrine;resampling (statistics);retina;retinal diseases;synthetic data;time series	Allan Tucker;David F.

317e39b20f11032b81ac77c806034717dee0d26d	from subjective to objective: quantitative computerized monitoring tool for mri-guided cryoablation		During percutaneous ablations, interventionalists currently rely on subjective assessments of procedural images to determine if the ablation is successful and the extent of injury to the surrounding tissues. In order to provide an objective assessment of these images, we developed a unified software package for monitoring MRI-guided cryoablation in real-time. We assessed its feasibility and functionality within the workflow of renal tumor cryoablation procedures using images from 13 MRI-guided renal tumor cryoablation procedures. This retrospective study demonstrated that the software package met the real-time requirements with 92 % success. We were therefore able to develop a comprehensive, real-time, interventionalist-friendly software package for quantitative monitoring of MRI-guided percutaneous cryoablation procedures, which aides in the assessment of tumor eradication and is compatible with the clinical workflow of these procedure. This tool has the potential to minimize damage to surrounding parenchyma and nearby critical structures, thereby enhancing patient safety and treatment success.		Jonathan Scalera;Xinyang Liu;Gary P.

Voxel-by-voxel compartment model analysis can derive functional images of living tissues, but it suffers from high noise statistics in voxel-based PET data and extended calculation times. We initially set up a feature space of the target radiopharmaceutical composed of a measured plasma time activity curve and a set of compartment model parameters, and measured the noise distribution of the PET data. The dynamic PET data were projected onto the feature space, and then clustered using the Mahalanobis distance. Our method was validated using simulation studies, and compared with ROI-based ordinary kinetic analysis for FDG. The parametric images exhibited an acceptable linear relation with the simulations and the ROI-based results, and the calculation time took about 10 min. We therefore concluded that our proposed MAP-based algorithm is practical.	anatomical compartments;body tissue;feature vector;fluorodeoxyglucose f18;functional discourse grammar;kinetics;maxima and minima;mental suffering;multi-compartment model;phenylephrine hydrochloride 10 mg oral tablet;plasma active;polyethylene terephthalate;preparation;projections and predictions;radiopharmaceuticals;region of interest;simulation;voxel;algorithm;glucose metabolism	Yuichi Kimura;Mika Naganawa;Jun Yamaguchi;Yuki Takabayashi;Akihiko Uchiyama;Keiichi Oda;Kenji Ishii;Kiichi Ishiwata	2006	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.08.046	computer vision;simulation;radiology;medicine;mahalanobis distance;map;functional imaging;mathematics;pet;nuclear medicine	ML	44.66503494412857	-80.86371371666822	44468

However, the visualization and subsequent morpho-geometric measurements in IVUS longitudinal cuts are subject to distortion caused by periodic image/vessel motion around the IVUS catheter. Usually, to overcome the image motion artifact ECG-gating and image-gated approaches are proposed, leading to slowing the pullback acquisition or disregarding part of IVUS data. In this paper, we argue that the image motion is due to 3-D vessel geometry as well as cardiac dynamics, and propose a dynamic model based on the tracking of an elliptical vessel approximation to recover the rigid transformation and align IVUS images without loosing any IVUS data. We report an extensive validation with synthetic simulated data and in vivo IVUS sequences of 30 patients achieving an average reduction of the image artifact of 97% in synthetic data and 79% in real-data. Our study shows that IVUS alignment improves longitudinal analysis of the IVUS data and is a necessary step towards accurate reconstruction and volumetric measurements of 3-D IVUS.	align (company);approximation;artifact (error);blood vessel tissue;distortion;imagery;incised wound;intravascular ultrasound;mathematical model;muscle rigidity;patients;seventy nine;synthetic data;synthetic intelligence;video-in video-out;visual artifact	Misael Rosales;Petia Radeva;Oriol Rodriguez-Leor;Debora Gil	2009	Medical image analysis	10.1016/j.media.2008.06.012	fourier transform;three-dimensional space;computer vision;radiology;computer science;motion estimation;mathematics;cross section;synthetic data	Vision	42.96232107315602	-82.66294369785605	44503

The conventional methods are based on simple subtraction of ultrasound images to detect ultrasound contrast agents, where the conventional methods need ultrasound image sequences with and without contrast agents. Even if the subject slightly moves, the detection result of the conventional methods includes significant errors. On the other hand, the proposed method employs the spatio-temporal analysis of the pixel intensity variation over several frames. The proposed method also employs motion estimation to select optimal image frames for detecting contrast agents. Through a set of experiments using mice, we demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits efficient performance compared with the conventional methods.	computer mouse;experiment;medical ultrasound;motion estimation;pixel;sensor	Kazumasa Noro;Koichi Ito;Yukari Yanagisawa;Maya Sakamoto;Shiro Mori;Kiyoto Shiga;Tetsuya Kodama;Takafumi Aoki	2014	Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA), 2014 Asia-Pacific	10.1109/APSIPA.2014.7041598	computer vision;radiology;medicine;medical physics	Vision	42.309389628318165	-82.68408327799264	45115

This non-invasive imaging modality has the unique advantage of high spatial-temporal resolution in millimeters over milliseconds. This work was designed to test an existing 32-channel EIT system, a modified UCL ScouseTom, and to discuss the feasibility of imaging neural activity in retinal tissue through computer simulation. The finite element method was used to model a retinal slice with a realistic conductivity-depth profile of the macaque eye. The conductivity perturbation was simulated in five different layers of the model. 5µVRMS white noise was added to boundary voltages. Simulation results showed that it is feasible to apply EIT in retinal tissue but the injection current is near threshold of unwanted phosphenes induction. Therefore the suggested future work are validating threshold current through animal experiments, developing electrodes with low contact impedance and mitigating noise through averaging.	accommodation phosphene disorder;cerebral cortex;characteristic impedance;computer simulation;dielectric spectroscopy;electromagnetically induced transparency;entity class - imaging modality;experiment;finite element method;macaca;modality (human–computer interaction);nominal impedance;quantitative impedance;retina;white noise;anatomical layer;electric impedance;electrode;millimeter;tomography	Danyi Zhu;Xiunan Fang;Calvin D.

A straightforward means of providing an objective diagnosis in real time might be for using classifiers to identify individual parts of every endoscopic video frame, but the results could be highly unstable due to out-of-focus frames. To address this problem, we propose a defocus-aware Dirichlet particle filter (D-DPF) that combines a particle filter with a Dirichlet distribution and defocus information.   METHODS We develop a particle filter with a Dirichlet distribution that represents the state transition and likelihood of each video frame. We also incorporate additional defocus information by using isolated pixel ratios to sample from a Rayleigh distribution.   RESULTS We tested the performance of the proposed method using synthetic and real endoscopic videos with a frame-wise classifier trained on 1671 images of colorectal endoscopy. Two synthetic videos comprising 600 frames were used for comparisons with a Kalman filter and D-DPF without defocus information, and D-DPF was shown to be more robust against the instability of frame-wise classification results. Computation time was approximately 88ms/frame, which is sufficient for real-time applications. We applied our method to 33 endoscopic videos and showed that the proposed method can effectively smoothen highly unstable probability curves under actual defocus of the endoscopic videos.   CONCLUSION The proposed D-DPF is a useful tool for smoothing unstable results of frame-wise classification of endoscopic videos to support real-time diagnosis during endoscopic examinations.

ff241f1003790f3224d7cc4114518ada4db54cd3	a deep learning approach to denoise optical coherence tomography images of the optic nerve head		Purpose. To develop a deep learning approach to de-noise optical coherence tomography (OCT) B-scans of the optic nerve head (ONH). Methods. Volume scans consisting of 97 horizontal B-scans were acquired through the center of the ONH using a commercial OCT device (Spectralis) for both eyes of 20 subjects. For each eye, single-frame (without signal averaging), and multi-frame (75x signal averaging) volume scans were obtained. A custom deep learning network was then designed and trained with 2,328 clean B-scans(multi-frame B-scans), and their corresponding noisy B-scans(clean B-scans + gaussian noise) to de-noise the single-frame Bscans. The performance of the de-noising algorithm was assessed qualitatively, and quantitatively on 1,552 B-scans using the signal to noise ratio (SNR), contrast to noise ratio (CNR), and mean structural similarity index metrics (MSSIM). Results. The proposed algorithm successfully denoised unseen single-frame OCT B-scans. The denoised B-scans were qualitatively similar to their corresponding multi-frame B-scans, with enhanced visibility of the ONH tissues.

Local shear wave speed is estimated and enables the two dimensional mapping of shear elasticity. This imaging modality is implemented on conventional probes driven by dedicated ultrafast echographic devices and can be performed during a standard ultrasound exam. The clinical potential of SSI is today extensively investigated for many potential applications such as breast cancer diagnosis, liver fibrosis staging, cardiovascular applications, ophthalmology.

In this paper we describe and evaluate a novel method based on template matching for detection and localization of arbitrary shaped fiducials. Segmentation methods are not adequate for these fiducials because their appearance in online X-ray projections can vary greatly as a function of imaging angle. The algorithm is based on using the planning CT image to generate templates that correspond to the imaging angles of the online images. We demonstrate successful tracking of complex shape fiducials in clinical images of lung and abdomen. We also validate the algorithm by comparing the results with a segmentation approach for one case in which the fiducials could be tracked by both methods. We also show how by adaptive thresholding of the match scores, we can control the false detection rate.	ct scan;clinical use template;diagnostic radiologic examination;fiducial marker;implants;internationalization and localization;neoplasms;projections and predictions;structure of parenchyma of lung;template matching;thresholding (image processing);algorithm	H.

In fluorescence microscopy there is a basic tradeoff between the degree of image noise and the frequency with which images can be acquired and therefore the ability to follow dynamic events. The correlation coefficient r is commonly used in fluorescence microscopy for colocalization measurements, when the relative distributions of two fluorophores are of interest. Unfortunately, r is known to be biased understating the true correlation when noise is present. A better measure of correlation is needed. This article analyses the expected value of r and comes up with a procedure for evaluating the bias of r, expected value formulas. A Taylor series of so-called invariant factors is analyzed in detail. These formulas indicate ways to correct r and thereby obtain a corrected value free from the influence of noise that is on average accurate (unbiased). One possible correction is the attenuated corrected correlation coefficient R, introduced heuristically by Spearman (in Am. J. Psychol. 15:72–101, 1904). An ideal correction formula in terms of expected values is derived. For large samples R tends towards the ideal correction formula and the true noise-free correlation. Correlation measurements using simulation based on the types of noise found in fluorescence microscopy images illustrate both the power of the method and the variance of R. We conclude that the correction formula is valid and is particularly useful for making correct analyses from very noisy datasets.	coefficient;heuristic;image noise;region of interest;simulation;value (computer science)	Fredrik Bergholm;Jeremy Adler;Ingela Parmryd	2010	Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision	10.1007/s10851-010-0200-z	fluorescence microscope;econometrics;taylor series;correction for attenuation;mathematics;expected value;statistics;region of interest	AI	45.92641533166859	-80.85335292423211	46322

Numerical simulation was performed for normal and stenosed coronary artery models of 70, 80 and 90% AS (area stenosis). Pressure, velocity, wall shear stress and fractional flow reserve (FFR) were measured and compared with the normal coronary artery model during the cardiac cycle. The results show that, as the percentage AS increase, the pressure drop increases as compared with the normal coronary artery model. Considerable elevation of velocity was observed as the percentage AS increases. The results also demonstrate a recirculation zone immediate after the stenosis which could lead to further progression of stenosis in the flow-disturbed area. Highest wall shear stress was observed for 90% AS as compared to other models that could result in the rupture of coronary artery. The FFR of 90% AS is found to be considerably low.	atherosclerosis;ct scan;color gradient;congenital abnormality;eighty;fractional flow reserve of vessel;hemodynamics;interventional procedure;left coronary artery structure;patients;simulation;steam rupture;stenosis;vps51 gene;velocity (software development);video-in video-out;shear stress;standards characteristics	Sarfaraz Kamangar;Irfan Anjum Badruddin;Kalimuthu Govindaraju;N.

Various criteria have been suggested to find the correspondence mappings between two lung images acquired at different levels of inflation. In this paper, we describe a new metric, the sum of squared vesselness measure difference (SSVMD), that utilizes the rich information of blood vessel locations and matches similar vesselness patterns in two images. Preserving both the lung tissue volume and the vesselness measure, a registration algorithm is developed to minimize the sum of squared tissue volume difference (SSTVD) and SSVMD together. We compare the registration accuracy using SSTVD + SSVMD with that using SSTVD alone by registering lung CT images of three normal human subjects. After adding the new SSVMD metric, the improvement of registration accuracy is observed by landmark error and fissure positioning error analyses. The average values of landmark error and fissure positioning error are reduced by about 30% and 25%, respectively. The mean landmark error is on the order of 1 mm. Statistical testing of landmark errors shows that there is a statistically significant difference between two methods with p values < 0.05 in all three subjects. Visual inspection shows there are obvious accuracy improvements in the lung regions near the thoracic cage after adding SSVMD.© (2010) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

Data-driven detection and correction of motion can be achieved by comparison of acquired data with the forward projections. This enables the brain locations to be estimated and data to be correctly incorporated in a three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction algorithm. Digital and physical phantom experiments were performed to explore practical aspects of this approach. Noisy simulation data modeling multiple 3-D patient head movements were constructed by projecting the digital Hoffman brain phantom at various orientations. Hoffman physical phantom data incorporating deliberate movements were also gathered. Motion correction was applied to these data using various regimes to determine the importance of attenuation and successive iterations. Studies were assessed visually for artifact reduction, and analyzed quantitatively via a mean registration error (MRE) and mean square difference measure (MSD). Artifacts and distortion in the motion corrupted data were reduced to a large extent by application of this algorithm. MRE values were mostly well within 1 pixel (4.4 mm) for the simulated data. Significant MSD improvements (>2) were common. Inclusion of attenuation was unnecessary to accurately estimate motion, doubling the efficiency and simplifying implementation. Moreover, most motion-related errors were removed using a single iteration. The improvement for the physical phantom data was smaller, though this may be due to object symmetry. In conclusion, these results provide the basis of an implementation protocol for clinical validation of the technique.	3d computer graphics;ct scan;compression artifact;data modeling;distortion;experiment;head movements;imaging phantom;iteration;mean squared error;mental orientation;morphologic artifacts;movement;multiple sulfatase deficiency disease;patients;period-doubling bifurcation;phantoms, imaging;photons;pixel;projections and predictions;simulation;small;tomography, emission-computed;tomography, emission-computed, single-photon;visual artifact;x-ray computed tomography;algorithm;registration - actclass	A.

We implemented our simulation and visualization system on the National Science Foundation’s TeraGrid and demonstrated it at the iGrid 2005 conference in San Diego, California. We discuss our experience in running on a computational Grid and present observations and suggestions for improving similar experiences. 1. Simulating the Human Arterial System The present study is motivated by a grand challenge problem in biomechanics— the simulation of blood flow in the entire human arterial tree—whose solution is not feasible with conventional supercomputers. This problem presents significant fundamental and application challenges, but a solution will have profound scientific and societal impacts. The human arterial tree simulation problem originates from the widely accepted causal relationship between blood flow and the formation of arterial disease such as atherosclerotic plaques. These disease conditions preferentially develop in separated and recirculating flow regions such as arterial branches and bifurcations. Interactions of blood flow in the human arterial system can occur between different scales, or at similar scales in different regions, of the vascular system. At the largest scale, the human arterial system is coupled through the wavelike nature of the pulse information traveling from the heart into elastic arteries. Surgical interventions, such as bypass grafts, alter the wave reflections, which in turn can modify the flow waveforms at seemingly remote locations. Subsequently, the modification of a local waveform can lead to the onset of undesirable wall stresses, thereby possibly starting another pathological event. Modeling of the three-dimensional unsteady fluid dynamics within sites of interest such as arterial branches requires enormous processing power. What makes this type of application amenable to Grid computing is that the waveform coupling between the sites of interest can be reasonably modeled by a reduced set of one-dimensional equations that capture the cross-sectional area and sectional velocity properties [7]. One can therefore simulate the entire arterial tree using a hybrid approach based on a reduced set of one-dimensional equations for the overall system and detailed 3D Navier-Stokes equations at arterial branches and bifurcations. To capture the flow dynamics in an artery bifurcation reasonably well, the grid resolution typically requires a mesh of 70,000 to 200,000 finite elements of high order; here we use spectral elements with a spectral polynomial order of 10 to 12 on each element [3]. The human arterial tree model in Figure 1 contains the largest 55 arteries in the human body with 27 artery bifurcations. The inclusion of all 27 artery bifurcations in the simulation with the above grid resolutions requires a total memory of 3 to 7 terabytes, which is beyond the current capacity of any single supercomputing site available to the open research community in the United States. At present, the National Science Foundation’s TeraGrid has a combined processing power of nearly 50 teraflops and 1.5 petabytes of online storage and is connected over a 30 Gb/s intersite network [1]. Equipped with MPICH-G2 [4] and the Globus-family of Grid services, the TeraGrid makes simulations at these resolutions possible. 2.

6ad3d40d28dff8fb49be7a52cc4e3ece7378703b	a platform for quantifying atrial structural remodelling		Cross sectional imaging tools are increasingly used prior to cardiac electrophysiology procedures. Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging provides detailed anatomic information that can quantify structural remodelling of the atrial chambers. Atrial Late Gadolinium Enhanced (LGE) CMR may be used to identify fibrotic change in the atrium. A standardised and transparent approach to the analysis of CMR imaging would facilitate a broader applicability of such tools for complex image analysis. Furthermore, an assessment of the utility of such tools beyond highly specialised centres would be possible. In this paper, we introduce an open source platform, provide standardised solutions for extracting information from clinical images, and propose standard definitions of the atrial anatomy for comparing clinical indices.	computational anatomy;image analysis;open-source software;resonance	Orod Razeghi;Rashed Karim;John Whitaker;Catalina Tobon-Gomez;Steven Niederer	2017	2017 Computing in Cardiology (CinC)		biomedical engineering;cross-sectional imaging;cardiac electrophysiology;magnetic resonance imaging;atrium (architecture);medicine	SE	37.90034435174722	-80.67386228522639	46784

In the prospect of producing new CDI-based tools, we developed a fast unsupervised denoiser and dealiaser (DeAN) algorithm for color Doppler raw data. The proposed technique uses robust and automated image post-processing techniques that make the DeAN clinically compliant. The DeAN includes three consecutive advanced and hands-off numerical tools: (1) statistical region merging segmentation, (2) recursive dealiasing process, and (3) regularized robust smoothing. The performance of the DeAN was evaluated using Monte-Carlo simulations on mock Doppler data corrupted by aliasing and inhomogeneous noise. Fifty aliased Doppler images of the left ventricle acquired with a clinical ultrasound scanner were also analyzed. The analytical study demonstrated that color Doppler data can be reconstructed with high accuracy despite the presence of strong corruption. The normalized RMS error on the numerical data was less than 8% even with signal-to-noise ratio as low as 10dB. The algorithm also allowed us to recover highly reliable Doppler flows in clinical data. The DeAN is fast, accurate and not observer-dependent.

Up till now, a consensus hasn't been reached on the selection of NDGD in DTI protocols for the computation of anisotropy indices and the deterministic fiber tracking. In this paper, we proposes a scheme for optimizing the NGDG in clinical DTI protocols. A case of low-grade glioma patient was acquired by five DTI protocols with five different NDGDs 6, 11, 15, 21, and 31. The DTI raw data of each NDGD was processed by the software of DTI Studio. The two DTI indices of relative anisotropy (RA) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were firstly calculated, and then the deterministic fiber tracking was conducted. Finally, the experimental results were evaluated by an experienced radiologist quantitatively and qualitatively. The results showed that the NDGD = 6 was suitable for the computation of DTI indices and the deterministic fiber tracking. The optimization of NDGD ensures the accuracy of tensor computation, and it is helpful for the data acquisition of DTI.	computation;data acquisition;fractional anisotropy;gradient;mathematical optimization;radiology;traffic collision avoidance system	Xufeng Yao;Yanxin Lu;Donggang Yu;Qingming Huang;Yuanjun Wang;Songlin Zhuang	2013	2013 Ninth International Conference on Natural Computation (ICNC)	10.1109/ICNC.2013.6818201	computer vision;mathematical optimization;mathematics;nuclear magnetic resonance	Vision	43.116858531331744	-84.17715331923415	47503
11f258ab4a8462c0a7671e097ba3918e4f7ad81b	motion and deformation estimation from medical imagery by modeling sub-structure interaction and constraints		This paper presents a novel medical image registration algorithm that explicitly models the physical constraints imposed by objects or sub-structures of objects that have differing material composition and border each other, which is the case in most medical registration applications. Typical medical image registration algorithms ignore these constraints and therefore are not physically viable, and to incorporate these constraints would require prior segmentation of the image into regions of differing material composition, which is a difficult problem in itself. We present a mathematical model and algorithm for incorporating these physical constraints into registration / motion and deformation estimation that does not require a segmentation of different material regions. Our algorithm is a joint estimation of different material regions and the motion/deformation within these regions. Therefore, the segmentation of different material regions is automatically provided in addition to the image registration satisfying the physical constraints. The algorithm identifies differing material regions (sub-structures or objects) as regions where the deformation has different characteristics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the analysis of cardiac MRI which includes the detection of the left ventricle boundary and its deformation. The experimental results indicate the potential of the algorithm as an assistant tool for the quantitative analysis of cardiac functions in the diagnosis of heart disease.	algorithm;image registration;mathematical model;medical imaging	Ganesh Sundaramoorthi;Byung-Woo Hong;Anthony J.

36cd0d4aa6442a7169676b978b0566cac648c3c9	simulation study on coil design for transcranial magnetic stimulation*		The purpose of this study is to optimize the coil for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). A novel multi-circle tangent coil (MTC) was designed, which consisted of five inner circular coils and one outer circular coil. These six circular coils were tangent to each other. The induced electric field and target area of MTC were investigated with both homogeneous phantom model and realistic human head model by numerical simulation. The results showed that MTC induced low electric field along its 4 surrounding inner coils thus weakened the stimulus effect on non-target areas. MTC not only takes the advantages of figure-8 coils with high focality, but also enables deep stimulation and multi-point stimulation at the same time. MTC is expected to have great potential in clinical application.	coil gene;coil device component;computer simulation;electroconvulsive therapy;imaging phantom;numerical analysis;numerous;phantoms, imaging;transcranial magnetic stimulation	Dongmei Hao;Yanan Zhou;Pei Gao;Lin Yang;Yimin Yang;Fei Chen	2018	2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2018.8512683	electromagnetic coil;transcranial magnetic stimulation;electronic engineering;imaging phantom;stimulation;homogeneous;computer science;electric field	Visualization	26.05199961348631	-84.40714650742258	47926

In this contribution, we present our recently developed an efficient and compact navigation system for paranasal sinus surgery and its first clinical trial. In our system, we use an optical-based 3D range imaging device intra-operatively, in order to achieve registration and a tracking of instruments. Before the intervention, the range image of patient’s face is acquired by a 3D range scanner and registered to corresponding surface extracted from the preoperative CT images. The surgical instrument fitted with spherical markers that also can be measured by range scanning device, is tracked during the procedure. The main advantages of our system are (a) markerless on the patient’s body, (b) an easy semiautomatic registration, (c) frameless during surgery, thus, it is feasible to update a registration and to restart the tracking when a patient moves. In this paper, we describe a summary of used techniques in our approach including the benefits and limitations of the system, experimental results using a precise model based on a human paranasal structure and a first clinical trial in the surgical room.

ed4eda68657b6a906d2aba39603b6ecdda5bd5ba	inter-operative biopsy site relocalization in gastroscopy: application to oesophagus. (relocalisation de site de biopsie en gastroscopie: application à l'œsophage)		Minimally invasive surgery in gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy has evolved from being a diagnostic tool to a therapeutic solution. It is common that GI procedures involve periodic monitoring or surveillance of the internal anatomy. Specifically in oesophageal procedures (the target of this thesis), surveillance interventions involve obtaining biopsies at different regions along the oesophagus. The tracking and relocalization of these biopsy sites “interoperatively” poses a significant challenge for providing targeted treatments. This thesis, clarifies the concept of relocalization, and analyses the need for a platform to aide GI endoscopy. Then, based on the understanding of the clinical context in oesophageal procedures; a novel framework to use electromagnetic tracking system is proposed, which is used to perform a “recording” of an intervention. This framework and the recording is then used to provide a guided navigation to the GI expert, during a follow-up surveillance endoscopy; for accurate re-positioning of the endoscope at previously targeted sites. This is achieved using inter-operative video synchronization, and the various steps involved in achieving this are described in this thesis. Following the description of system design and the methodology, a careful analysis of noise affecting the system is performed. Using a Gaussian noise model, quantitative evaluation of the system is performed with synthetic and real (porcine) data. The results indicate that the relocalization was achieved with an uncertainty in depth inside the oesophagus of ±10mm, which was considered acceptable for the GI expert. Additionally, qualitative experiments were performed using data from pigs, to simulate the real task of biopsy site relocalization, which was evaluated by 10 GI experts. The results of these experiments showed an improvement in biopsy site relocalization rate from 47.5% to 94%, thus clearly demonstrating the benefits of the proposed system towards assisted guidance. Furthermore, an incremental improvement in inter-operative video synchronization is proposed, that uses additional information obtained during the course of the intervention. Synthetic experiments indicated, inclusion of this additional information reduced the error in video synchronization by ∼ 50%. This framework, was then extended by proposing a constrained inter-operative image matching, for further improvement in quality of video synchronization. Within this context, the effect of, the choice of feature descriptors and colour-space, filtering of uninformative frames and the endoscopic modality in use, are investigated and shown that further improvement is achieved in image synchronization to [92%, 87%] from [73%, 76%] for both narrow band imaging and white-light endoscopic modalities. This research work has been implemented in a software (at IHU and IRCAD, Strasbourg), allowing us to validate our results in clinical conditions. This work was supported by IHU Strasbourg, through a grant# ANR-01AHU-02.		Anant Suraj Vemuri	2016				Robotics	41.50149872398328	-83.5239047933035	48123
b17ca2dc3ab225e44cdefb1fb5172b6a0a6bae6c	fast pet reconstruction using multi-scale fully convolutional neural networks		Reconstruction of PET images is an ill-posed inverse problem and often requires iterative algorithms to achieve good image quality for reliable clinical use in practice, at huge computational costs. In this paper, we consider the PET reconstruction a dense prediction problem where the large scale contextual information is essential, and propose a novel architecture of multi-scale fully convolutional neural networks (msfCNN) for fast PET image reconstruction. The proposed msfCNN gains large receptive fields with both memory and computational efficiency, by using a downscaling-upscaling structure and dilated convolutions. Instead of pooling and deconvolution, we propose to use the periodic shuffling operation from sub-pixel convolution and its inverse to scale the size of feature maps without losing resolution. Residual connections were added to improve training. We trained the proposed msfCNN model with simulated data, and applied it to clinical PET data acquired on a Siemens mMR scanner. The results from real oncological and neurodegenerative cases show that the proposed msfCNN-based reconstruction outperforms the iterative approaches in terms of computational time while achieving comparable image quality for quantification. The proposed msfCNN model can be applied to other dense prediction tasks, and fast msfCNNbased PET reconstruction could facilitate the potential use of molecular imaging in interventional/surgical procedures, where cancer surgery can particularly benefit.	algorithm;artificial neural network;computation;convolution;convolutional neural network;deconvolution;downscaling;image quality;iterative method;iterative reconstruction;map;molecular imaging;pixel;polyethylene terephthalate;time complexity;well-posed problem	Jieqing Jiao;Sébastien Ourselin	2017	CoRR		iterative reconstruction;computer vision;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning	Vision	47.05030705101907	-81.69736454731193	48132

The aim of this study was to distinguish skin cancer from benign nevi using multifrequency impedance spectra. Electrical impedance spectra of about 100 skin cancers and 511 benign nevi were measured. Impedance of reference skin was measured ipsi-laterally to the lesions. The impedance relation between lesion and reference skin was used to distinguish the cancers from the nevi. It was found that it is possible to separate malignant melanoma from benign nevi with 75% specificity at 100% sensitivity, and to distinguish nonmelanoma skin cancer from benign nevi with 87% specificity at 100% sensitivity. The power of skin cancer detection using electrical impedance is as good as, or better than, conventional visual screening made by general practitioners.	british informatics olympiad;cardiography, impedance;characteristic impedance;cutaneous candidiasis;dermatologic disorders;malignant neoplasms;malignant neoplasm of skin;nevus;nominal impedance;quantitative impedance;sensitivity and specificity;skin neoplasms;skin carcinoma;electric impedance;melanoma	Peter Aberg;Ingrid Nicander;Johan Hansson;Paul Geladi;Ulf Holmgren;Stig Ollmar	2004	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2004.836523	dermatology;medicine;pathology;electrical engineering;electrical impedance;accuracy and precision;oncology;skin;statistics;cancer	Visualization	27.01444266839027	-82.90328423852566	48235

a30bb39d134157b7de389b557304d899035b34a8	haptics-constrained motion for surgical intervention		Current open-heart procedures requiring the use of a medial sternotomy and a heart-lung machine can potentially be performed by entering the heart through the cardiac wall. A new procedure in cardiac surgery involves introducing an ablation tool through the appendage of the left atrium. This method, intended for the treatment of atrial fibrillation, septal defect repair and valve replacement, provides increased control over the ablating instrument. It is believed that this procedure will ultimately be performed under robotic control and image-guidance provided by intra-cardiac ultrasound. However, the intra-cardiac guidance presents several drawbacks, such as limited field of view, temporary loss of signal, and, in some cases, difficulty with interpreting the signal. We believe that the introduction of haptic feedback into this environment will enhance the procedure by providing tactile cues to assist in the location of the surgical targets.

Measured fiber angles in experiments are obtained from different species (e. g. rat, canine, dog, human heart) and vary by various reasons. It is unclear to what extent non-exact fiber angles impact the quality of computational simulations. In this paper, mechanical simulations with different ventricular angles were performed and compared. The simulations covered the complete heart with both ventricles, both atria and the pericardium and were performed using finite element method. Helix angles were varied between 20° and 70° on endocardium and -70° and -20° on epicardium. Results showed that fiber orientations had only a minor contribution to the difference between endsystolic and enddiastolic pressure of <; 8.3%. The influence on stroke volume as well as AVPD is significant (changes by 34% for SV and 241% for APVD), but it could not be observed that a higher AVPD yields a higher stroke volume. Concludingly, fiber orientations are important for reliable computational simulations of human hearts and should be incorporated with great care.	computation;computer simulation;experiment;finite element method;optical fiber;software propagation;systemverilog	Lukas Baron;Thomas Fritz;Gunnar Seemann;Olaf Dössel	2014	Computing in Cardiology 2014		structural engineering;engineering;biological engineering;engineering drawing	Robotics	27.33951389272376	-84.82199116136297	48422
e9f9fd560bdb6c272c74136945e5329191e44e4d	experimental study on nerve signals block for spasticity based on antimissile strategy		A method of blocking neural signal for spasticity which is based on the antimissile strategy was proposed. When the pathological nerve action potential signal is detected at the proximal end of the nerve, such a potential signal that is opposite to the signal of the primary neural activity is applied at the distal end of the nerve at a proper delay so as to block the pathological nerve signal. Preliminary tests were performed on toad sciatic nerve-gastrocnemius specimens. Firstly, the effect of the distance between blocking electrodes on the blocking pulse voltage threshold was studied based on the electrical tension induced by the nerve signal on the controlled muscle. Then, the effective parameters of the blocking waveform were studied. Finally, the delay range of the blocking pulse compared to the pathogen action potential was studied. The results showed that in the sciatic nerve-gastrocnemius specimens, the most effective distance between the blocking electrode pairs was 5 mm and the anodic block required an inverted triangle waveform. The voltage threshold of an effective anodic blocking pulse was 1 V and the minimum pulse width was 90 ms. Under the condition of voltage threshold and minimum pulse width, the time shifting value of blocking pulse was greater than 1ms. It is concluded from the study that the spastic action potential caused by the disease can be effectively blocked, and limb muscle spasms can be eliminated under the action of appropriate electrode configuration and blocking signal waveforms.	abducens nerve diseases;action potential;blocking (computing);bufonidae;experiment;gastrocnemius muscle structure;greater than;limb structure;muscle spasticity;nerve block;nerve tissue;pathogenic organism;pulse-width modulation;spasm;spastic;specimen;structure of sciatic nerve;tension;waveform;electrode;voltage;width	Zhi-Gong Wang;Xiao-Ying Lü;Yu-Jie Gao;Jian J.

745c6b2c9b586669b4f87bd09602cab2f98f37a2	real-time transverse process detection in ultrasound.		PURPOSE: Ultrasound offers a safe radiation-free approach to visualize the spine and measure or assess scoliosis. However, ultrasound assessment also poses major challenges. We propose a real-time algorithm and software implementation to automatically delineate the posterior surface patches of transverse processes in tracked ultrasound; a necessary step toward the ultimate goal of spinal curvature measurement. METHODS: Following a pre-filtering of each captured ultrasound image, the shadows cast by each transverse process bone is examined and contours which are likely posterior bone surface are kept. From these contours, a three-dimensional volume of the bone surfaces is created in real-time as the operator acquires the images. The processing algorithm was implemented on the PLUS and 3D Slicer open-source software platforms. RESULTS: The algorithm was tested with images captured using the SonixTouch ultrasound scanner, Ultrasonix C5-2 curvilinear transducer and NDI trakSTAR electromagnetic tracker. Ultrasound data was collected from patients presenting with idiopathic adolescent scoliosis. The system was able to produce posterior surface patches of the transverse process in real-time, as the images were acquired by a non-expert sonographer. The resulting transverse process surface patches were compared with manual segmentation by an expert. The average Hausdorff distance was 3.0 mm when compared to the expert segmentation. CONCLUSION: The resulting surface patches are expected to be sufficiently accurate for driving a deformable registration between the ultrasound space and a generic spine model, to allow for three-dimensional visualization of the spine and measuring its curvature.	3dslicer;algorithm;contour line;hausdorff dimension;medical ultrasound;open-source software;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time locating system;real-time transcription;transducer;transverse wave	Csaba Pinter;Bryan Travers;Zachary Baum;Shahrokh Kamali;Tamas Ungi;Andras Lasso;Ben Church;Gabor Fichtinger	2018		10.1117/12.2295605	computer vision;hausdorff distance;curvature;visualization;scanner;software;ultrasound;transverse plane;artificial intelligence;segmentation;computer science	Vision	40.79928276802169	-84.0588036435924	48509

Methods PSP cephalograms of orthodontic patients were obtained. These 8 bit and 16 bit images were viewed in random order in baseline “for processing,” emboss, pseudo color and emboss/pseudo color states. Ten observers viewed the images simultaneously and idependently. Selected soft tissue and hard tissue cephalometric landmarks and of overall image clarity were rated. Repeat images were included to determine intra observer reliability in making ratings. Results Statistically significant differences were found in the preferred image state for both specific cephalometric landmark evaluation and image bit depth. The emboss state was most frequently rated highest for clarity of hard tissue landmarks. Pseudo color state was rated best for soft tissue landmarks. Interrater agreement varied between landmarks but was not altered significantly by bit depth. Intrarater agreement was high. Conclusions Post-processing enhancement of PSP cephalograms is perceived to improve clarity of selected anatomic landmarks in PSP cephalograms.	16-bit;baseline (configuration management);cephalometry;emboss;image quality;inter-rater reliability;phosphor;video post-processing	Ryan B.

6fec7afbde8dda653793f51c54dde1062cd7831c	a comparative study of breast surface reconstruction for aesthetic outcome assessment		Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer type in women, and while its survival rate is generally high the aesthetic outcome is an increasingly important factor when evaluating different treatment alternatives. 3D scanning and reconstruction techniques offer a flexible tool for building detailed and accurate 3D breast models that can be used both pre-operatively for surgical planning and post-operatively for aesthetic evaluation. This paper aims at comparing the accuracy of low-cost 3D scanning technologies with the significantly more expensive state-ofthe-art 3D commercial scanners in the context of breast 3D reconstruction. We present results from 28 synthetic and clinical RGBD sequences, including 12 unique patients and an anthropomorphic phantom demonstrating the applicability of low-cost RGBD sensors to real clinical cases. Body deformation and homogeneous skin texture pose challenges to the studied reconstruction systems. Although these should be addressed appropriately if higher model quality is warranted, we observe that lowcost sensors are able to obtain valuable reconstructions comparable to the state-of-the-art within an error margin of 3 mm.	3d reconstruction;3d scanner;computational human phantom;expectation propagation;image scanner;imaging phantom;nsb/appstudio;norm (social);phantom reference;sensor;synthetic data;synthetic intelligence	Rene M.

It is widely accepted that highly orientated collagen fibers in tendons a play critical role for transferring tensile stress and demonstrate birefringent optical properties. However, the influence that proteoglycans have on the optical properties of tendons is yet to be fully elucidated. Tendinopathy (defined as a syndrome of tendon pain, tenderness and swelling that affects the normal function of the tissue) is a common disease associated with sporting injuries or degeneration. PG's are the essential components of the tendon extracellular matrix; changes in their quantities and compositions have been associated with tendinopathy. In this study, polarization sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) has been used to reveal the relationship between proteoglycan content/location and birefringent properties of tendons. Tendons dissected from freshly slaughtered chickens were imaged at regular intervals by PS-OCT and polarizing light microscope during the extraction of PGs or glycosaminoglycans using established protocols (guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) or proteinase K solution). The macroscopic and microscopic time lapsed images are complimentary; mutually demonstrating that there was a higher concentration of PG's in the outer sheath region than in the fascicles; and the integrity of the sheath affected extraction process and the OCT birefringence bands. Extraction of PGs using GuHCl disturbed the organization of local collagen bundles, which corresponded to a reduction in the frequency of birefringence bands and the band width by PS-OCT. The feature of OCT penetration depth helped us to define the heterogeneous distribution of PG's in tendon, which was complimented by polarizing light microscopy. The results provide new insight of tendon structure and also demonstrate a great potential for using PS-OCT as a diagnostic tool to examine tendon pathology.	birefringence;ps-algol;tomography	Ying Yang;Asha Rupani;Alan Weightman;Ian Wimpenny;Mark Ahearne	2011	2011 4th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics (BMEI)	10.1109/BMEI.2011.6098761	birefringence;extracellular matrix;penetration depth;polarization;polarized light microscopy;optical fiber;biomechanics;optics;anatomy;surgery;glycosaminoglycan	Visualization	27.184456086745776	-83.36050312967085	49121

a006ad09186dfbdb445f2ef634924666cf516e96	physically valid surgical simulators: linear versus nonlinear tissue models		Realistic modeling of the interaction between surgical instruments and organs has been recognized as a key requirement in the development of high-fidelity surgical simulators. For a nonlinear model, the well-known Poynting effect developed during shearing of the tissue results in normal forces not seen in a linear elastic model. It is demonstrated that the difference in force magnitude for myocardial tissue is larger than the just noticeable difference for contact force discrimination thresholds published in the psychophysics literature. This work also proposes the validation of simulators by careful examination of relevant simulator design parameters that relate to final simulator behaviors affecting clinical outcomes.	behavior;body tissue;greater;instrument - device;myocardium;nonlinear system;organ;poynting's theorem;psychophysics;scientific publication;simulators;surgical instruments;whole earth 'lectronic link	Sarthak Misra;K.

In a 3-D volume too many parameters are required to be able to obtain stable estimates with good spatial resolution and good accuracy. One approach to such problems that has been presented recently in a number of reports, when the relevant constituent parameters can be modeled as isotropic and piecewise continuous or homogeneous, is to use shape-based solutions. In this work, we report on a method, based on a spherical harmonics expansion, that allows us to parameterize the 3-D objects which constitute the conductivity inhomogeneities in the interior; for instance, we could assume the general shape of piecewise constant inhomogeneities is known but their conductivities and their exact location and shape are not. Using this assumption, we have developed a 3-stage optimization algorithm that allows us to iteratively estimate the location of the inhomogeneous objects, to find their external boundaries and to estimate their internal conductivities. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated via simulation in a realistic torso model, as well as via experimental data from a tank phantom.	algorithm;boundary element method;characteristic impedance;discretization;electromagnetically induced transparency;experiment;finite element method;location-based service;mathematical optimization;nominal impedance;phantom reference;region of interest;salineos;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;tomography;volume mesh;voxel	Saeed Babaeizadeh;Dana H.

However only one was found to efficiently affect cortical excitability: anode/cathode over the primary motor cortex and return electrode placed over the contralateral orbit (M-CF configuration). In this work we used the finite element method to calculate the electric field (E-field) induced in a realistic human head model in all the proposed electrode configurations. In order to analyze the results, average values of the E-field's magnitude and polar/azimuthal angles were calculated in several cortical motor and premotor areas which may have an effect on the output of the primary motor cortex. The average E-field's magnitude at the hand-knob (HK) was similar between the M-CF configuration (0.16 V/m) and a few other tested configurations, the same happening for the average polar angle (129°). However this configuration achieved the highest mean E-field values over premotor (PM) areas (0.21 V/m). These results show that the polar angle and the average magnitude of the E-field evaluated at the HK and at the PM cortex might be important parameters in predicting the success of a specific electrode montage in tDCS.	adrenal cortex diseases;cerebral cortex;control knob;excited state;finite element method;knob device component;montagejs;transcranial direct current stimulation;primary motor cortex	Ricardo Salvador;Cornelia Wenger;Michael A.

During such procedures, accurate needle tip placement is critical for correct diagnosis or successful treatment. Accurate placement of the needle tip inside tissue is challenging, especially when the target moves and anatomical obstacles must be avoided. We develop a needle steering system capable of autonomously and accurately guiding a steerable needle using two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound images. The needle is steered to a moving target while avoiding moving obstacles in a three-dimensional (3D) non-static environment. Using a 2D ultrasound imaging device, our system accurately tracks the needle tip motion in 3D space in order to estimate the tip pose. The needle tip pose is used by a rapidly exploring random tree-based motion planner to compute a feasible needle path to the target. The motion planner is sufficiently fast such that replanning can be performed repeatedly in a closed-loop manner. This enables the system to correct for perturbations in needle motion, and movement in obstacle and target locations. Our needle steering experiments in a soft-tissue phantom achieves maximum targeting errors of 0.86 ± 0.35 mm (without obstacles) and 2.16 ± 0.88 mm (with a moving obstacle).	3d computer graphics;clinical act of insertion;experiment;imaging device;insertion mutation;medical ultrasound;motion planning;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;rapidly-exploring random tree;therapeutic radiology procedure;track (course);ultrasonography;cancer therapy;cellular targeting	Gustaaf J.

In urgent operations, the most common way for 3-D model reconstruction is to extract C-arm images by C-arm fluoroscopic imaging. However, it is harmful to human bodies because of the ionizing radiation. In this work, we present a model deformation approach for 3D reconstruction from medical imaging. Our approach utilizes the visual hull algorithm to reconstruct a rough 3-D model from C-arm images, and then deforms it according a reference model. During the deformation stage, some adjustments are made for the models and the coherent point drift algorithm is carried out to match the 3-D points of two models. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of our technique for 3-D model reconstruction from C-arm imaging.	3d modeling;3d reconstruction;algorithm;coherence (physics);medical imaging;point set registration;reference model;refinement (computing);visual hull	Yan-Ru Chen;Huei-Yung Lin;Min-Liang Wang	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	10.1109/SMC.2016.7844607	iterative reconstruction;medical imaging;computer vision;simulation;solid modeling;computational model;computer graphics (images)	Vision	44.6892891272588	-82.77034582905019	50524

For this study, 100 cases of echocardiography videos (dynamic organ)—50 with an ejection fraction (EF) of ≥50 s and 50 with EF <50 %—and 100 cases of suspected pediatric appendicitis (static organ)—50 with signs of acute appendicitis and 50 with no findings of appendicitis—were consecutively selected. Twelve reviewers reviewed the original videos using the liquid crystal display (LCD) monitor of an ultrasound machine and using a smartphone, to which the images were transmitted from the ultrasound machine. The resolution of the transmitted echocardiography videos was reduced by approximately 20 % to increase the frame rate of transmission given the limited internet speed. The differences in diagnostic performance between the two devices when evaluating left ventricular (LV) systolic function by measuring the EF and when evaluating the presence of acute appendicitis were investigated using a five-point Likert scale. The average areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for each reviewer’s interpretations using the LCD monitor and smartphone were respectively 0.968 (0.949–0.986) and 0.963 (0.945–0.982) (P = 0.548) for echocardiography and 0.972 (0.954–0.989) and 0.966 (0.947–0.984) (P = 0.175) for abdominal ultrasonography. We confirmed the feasibility of remotely interpreting ultrasound images using smartphones, specifically for evaluating LV function and diagnosing pediatric acute appendicitis; the images were transferred from the ultrasound machine using image quality-controlled telesonography.	acute appendicitis nos (disorder);cloud fraction;echocardiography;ejection fraction (procedure);entity framework;image quality;internet access;interpretation process;liquid crystals;logical volume management;organ;real-time clock;receiver operating characteristic;smartphone;thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display;ultrasonography;used quit cigarette smoking videos;ventricular dysfunction, left;transmission process;videocassette	Changsun Kim;Hyunmin Cha;Bo Seung Kang;Hyuk Joong Choi;Tae Ho Lim;Jaehoon Oh	2015	Journal of Digital Imaging	10.1007/s10278-015-9849-6	text mining;medical research;simulation;radiology;medicine;pathology;computer science	HCI	35.64980106437627	-81.8018547274041	50577
b8d0a4da5c8becd14ac4d55b8167849bf6915bd1	a constrained independent component analysis technique for artery-vein separation of two-photon laser scanning microscopy images of the cerebral microvasculature	non negativity constraint;artery vein separation;constrained independent components analysis cica;cerebral microvasculature;gamma variate model	Understanding brain hemodynamics as well as the coupling between microvascular hemodynamics and neural activity is important in pathophysiology of cerebral microvasculature. When local increases in neuronal activity occur, the blood volume changes in the surrounding brain vasculature. Dynamic contrast enhanced imaging (DCE) is a powerful technique that quantifies these changes in the blood flow by repeatedly imaging the vasculature over time. Separating artery, vein and capillaries in the images and extracting their intensity-time curves from the DCE image sequence is an important first step in understanding vascular function. A constrained independent component analysis (ICA) technique is developed to analyze the two photon laser scanning microscopy (2PLSM) images of rat brain microvasculature, where a bolus of fluorescent dye is administered to the vascular system as the contrast agent. A priori information inferred from the gamma variate model of cerebral microvasculature is incorporated with the data driven technique in temporal and spatial domains using two constraints. The constraints are: no independent component (IC) is allowed to have negative contribution in forming the images (positivity constraint) and the component curves follow a gamma variate function (model fitting constraint). Experimental and simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed constrained ICA (CICA) technique over the most commonly used classical ICA algorithm (fast-ICA) in providing physiologically meaningful ICs and its ability to separate the model following factors from other factors are shown. The efficiency of CICA in handling noise is compared to model based techniques. Its capability in providing improved separation between artery, vein and capillaries compared to the other two techniques is also demonstrated.	benign childhood cerebral neoplasm;blood volume;blood capillaries;blood supply aspects;bolus tracking;cns disorder;cerebral infarction;contrast media;curve fitting;fastica;fluorescent dyes;function model;handling (psychology);hemodynamics;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;inference;interferon type ii;microvascular network;photons;simulation;algorithm	Hatef Mehrabian;Liis Lindvere;Bojana Stefanovic;Anne L.

62824d68e26030e542bf5f1442552173699d933b	robust feature-based registration using a gaussian-weighted distance map and brain feature points for brain pet/ct images	clinical data;image features;pet ct registration;brain segmentation;gaussian weighted distance map;pet imaging;optimal location;normalized mutual information;rigid registration;feature based registration	Feature-based registration is an effective technique for clinical use, because it can greatly reduce computational costs. However, this technique, which estimates the transformation by using feature points extracted from two images may cause misalignments, particularly in brain PET and CT images that have low correspondence rates between features due to differences in image characteristics. To cope with this limitation, we propose a robust feature-based registration technique using a Gaussian-weighted distance map (GWDM) that finds the best alignment of feature points even when features of two images are mismatched. A GWDM is generated by propagating the value of the Gaussian-weighted mask from feature points of CT images and leads the feature points of PET images to be aligned on an optimal location even though there is a localization error between feature points extracted from PET and CT images. Feature points are extracted from two images by our automatic brain segmentation method. In our experiments, simulated and clinical data sets were used to compare our method with conventional methods such as normalized mutual information (NMI)-based registration and chamfer matching in accuracy, robustness, and computational time. Experimental results showed that our method aligned the images robustly even in cases where conventional methods failed to find optimal locations. In addition, the accuracy of our method was comparable to that of the NMI-based registration method.	alignment;body image;ct scan;chamfer;computation;converge;convergence (action);diffusion weighted imaging;distance transform;estimated;experiment;extraction;feature vector;matching;muscle rigidity;mutual information;non-maskable interrupt;normal statistical distribution;organ;patients;polyethylene terephthalate;radiology information systems;supernumerary maxillary left lateral incisor;time complexity;visual inspection;biologic segmentation;brain segmentation;registration - actclass	Ho Lee;Jeongjin Lee;Namkug Kim;Sang Joon Kim;Yeong-Gil Shin	2008	Computers in biology and medicine	10.1016/j.compbiomed.2008.04.001	computer vision;computer science;image registration;machine learning;kanade–lucas–tomasi feature tracker;pattern recognition;feature	Vision	41.10054465345461	-81.05453207568789	50901

The system is based on see-through glasses. In extensive preclinical testing the system has proven its functionality and tests with volunteers had been performed successfully, based on MRI imaging. We report the surgeons view of the first use of the system for AR guided biopsy of a tumour near the skull base. Preoperative planning was performed based on CT image data. The information to be projected was the tumour volume and was segmented from image data. With the use of infrared cameras, the positions of patient and surgeon were tracked intraoperatively and the information on the glasses displays was updated accordingly. The systems proved its functionality under OR conditions in patient care: Augmented reality information could be visualized with sufficient accuracy for the surgical task. After intraoperative calibration by the surgeon, the biopsy was acquired successfully. The advantage of see through glasses is their flexibility. A virtual stereoscopic image can be set up wherever and whenever desired. A biopsy at a delicate location could be performed without the need for wide exposure. This means additional safety and lower operation related morbidity to the patient. The integration of the calibration-procedure of the glasses into the intraoperative workflow is of importance to the surgeon.© (2005) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

In such cases the structures outside the region of interest cause artefacts to appear in the reconstructed image and degrade the image quality of the tomogram. We proposed three new iterative approaches for the accurate reconstruction of the ROI by combining a high resolution set of projections, with low resolution full field of view projections and prior information. We also evaluate our methods reconstructing software phantoms, and compare their performance to other methods in the literature.	high-resolution scheme;tomography	László Varga;Rajmund Mokso	2018		10.1007/978-3-030-05288-1_12	computer science;artificial intelligence;computer vision;image quality;tomography;region of interest;software;general-purpose computing on graphics processing units;field of view	HPC	45.7753338024678	-82.72359372065617	50956

The growing data volume produced per examination increases the demand for 3D visualization of such data sets in radiology. Current medical imaging systems deliver 3D functionality either through Workstations or in Client/Server solutions. Workstation deployments suffer from the requirement to transfer huge data sets to every workstation where the data is needed. Client/Server solutions often suffer from scalability limits as data from all radiologists is rendered by a single server or a server farm, adding complexity and cost. In this paper, we present a novel 3D rendering approach using Cloud Computing that optimizes scalability and operational cost by architecture while flexibly adjusting to environments with low network quality.	3d rendering;cloud computing;display resolution;dynamic programming;mathematical optimization;medical imaging;radiology;scalability;server (computing);server farm;verification and validation;volume rendering;workstation	Karlheinz Dorn;Vladyslav Ukis;Thomas Friese	2011	2011 37th EUROMICRO Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications	10.1109/SEAA.2011.31	medical imaging;embedded system;cloud computing;computer science;operating system;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	37.99174099027126	-87.09620312555388	51178

However, in women with dense breast tissue, tissue overlap may obscure lesions. Digital breast tomosynthesis can reduce tissue overlap. Furthermore, imaging with contrast enhancement can provide additional functional information about lesions, such as morphology and kinetics, which in turn may improve lesion identification and characterization. The performance of these imaging techniques is strongly dependent on the structural composition of the breast, which varies significantly among patients. Therefore, imaging system and imaging technique optimization should take patient variability into consideration. Furthermore, optimization of imaging techniques that employ contrast agents should include the temporally varying breast composition with respect to the contrast agent uptake kinetics. To these ends, we have developed a suite of 4-D virtual breast phantoms, which are incorporated with the kinetics of contrast agent propagation in different tissues and can realistically model normal breast parenchyma as well as benign and malignant lesions. This development presents a new approach in performing simulation studies using truly anthropomorphic models. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed 4-D phantoms, we present a simplified example study to compare the performance of 14 imaging paradigms qualitatively and quantitatively.	body tissue;contrast media;galaxy morphological classification;heart rate variability;image quality;imaging techniques;kinetics internet protocol;mammary gland parenchyma;mammary neoplasms;mammography;mathematical optimization;monte carlo method;patients;phantoms, imaging;prototype;quantum noise;simulation;software propagation;spatial variability;tsh-producing pituitary gland carcinoma;tomosynthesis	Nooshin Kiarashi;Joseph Y.

Digital models of plates are typically available as CAD models that contain smooth analytic geometry representations including NURBS. With the existing pre-operative planning solutions, these models are converted to polygonal meshes and adapted manually to the patient's bone geometry by the user. Based on the deformed model, physical bending is then performed by the surgeon in operating room. With the proposed approach, CAD models are semi-automatically adapted using NURBS to generate customized plates that conform to the desired region of the bone surface of patients. This enables an efficient and accurate approach that is also computationally suitable for interactive planning applications. Moreover, the patient-specific customized plates can then be produced directly from the adapted CAD models with a standard CNC machine before surgery. This may dramatically reduce time spent in OR, improve precision of the procedure and as a result improve the patient's outcome.	bone tissue;computer-aided design;customize;decompression sickness;fracture fixation;fracture fixation, internal;non-uniform rational b-spline;operating room;patients;polygon mesh;semiconductor industry;solutions;surface of bone;wound healing	Suraj Musuvathy;Sergei Azernikov;Tong Fang	2011	2011 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6090132	structural engineering;spline;surface reconstruction;electronic design automation;computer science;engineering;biological engineering;solid modeling;engineering drawing	Robotics	38.453162381591966	-84.79291992400844	51351

However, it is not easy to correlate such information with the primary endoscopic view since it may not relate to the surface visible in the visual endoscopic images. As critical surfaces as well as surgical targets often lie subsurface, a range of techniques (e.g. ultrasound and near-infrared imaging) and registration methods have been investigated as robotic surgery gains popularity. While investigation of nerves, blood vessels, and tumors has received prior attention, we present a new prototype system for real-time multimodal image registration that focuses on the visualization of the urinary tract. By providing an accurate registration between stereo video images and a near infrared imager, we aim to enhance surgical awareness and make critical uretary tasks such as mobilization of the ureters easier.

56fe2cdf6649de991f2a5d9379445c8710fa7197	investigation of the spatial correlation in human white matter and the influence of age using 3-dimensional variography applied to mp-rage data	mp rage;variogram;spatial correlation;ageing;white matter changes	A novel method for the quantification of heterogeneity and spatial correlation in 3D MP-RAGE images of white matter is presented. The technique is based on the variogram, a tool commonly used in geosciences for the analysis of spatial data, and was tailored to the special requirements of MR image analysis. Influences from intensity non-uniformities, noise and arbitrary greyscale were quantified and considered in the calculations. The obtained variograms were fitted with spherical model functions to infer parameters that quantify heterogeneity and size of the correlation structures of the tissue. Numerically generated samples with well-defined correlation properties were employed to validate the estimation process and to provide an interpretation of the parameters obtained. It is shown that the method gives reliable results in an interval of correlation structures sized between 2mm and 20mm. The method was applied to 24 MP-RAGE datasets of healthy female volunteers ranging in age from 19 to 73 years. White matter was found to have two prominent correlation structures with sizes of approximately 3mm and 23 mm. The heterogeneity of the smaller structure increases significantly with age (r=0.83, p<10(-6)).	3-dimensional matching;ati rage;cardiomyopathies;data mining;diffusion tensor imaging;earth sciences;gain;grayscale;histogram;image analysis;inference;matlab;magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo mri;neuroscience discipline;numerical integration;quantitation;requirement;seizures;small;spherical model;white matter;receptor for advanced glycation endproducts	Fabian Keil;Ana-Maria Oros-Peusquens;Nadim Joni Shah	2012	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.07.034	ageing;econometrics;spatial correlation;variogram;statistics	Vision	48.49740065511828	-80.56180130805497	52177
18ca589cb20583285a0c69e2ef5d00533da7f38d	atlas-guided histology reconstruction of mouse brain		Histology acquisition often introduces tissue distortions that prevent a smooth 3D reconstruction from being built. In this paper, we propose a method of atlas-guided optimization to the piecewise registration scheme we developed previously. It takes the information of several consecutive slices in a neighbourhood into account. In order to achieve an accurate anatomic presentation, we run the method iteratively with the assistance from a pre-segmented brain atlas. The registration parameters are optimized to accommodate different brain sub-regions, e.g. cerebellum, hippocampus, etc. The results are evaluated by both visual and quantitative approaches. The proposed method has been proved to be robust enough for reconstructing an accurate and smooth mouse brain volume.	3d reconstruction;brain atlas;distortion;mathematical optimization;neighbourhood (graph theory)	Xi Qiu;Tony P.

A hybrid active contour model, working directly on the projected views, is proposed. The responses of a wavelet filter applied on the projections are thresholded and combined to obtain markers for mass candidates. The contours of markers are extracted and serve as initialization for the active contour model, which is then used to extract mass contours in DBT projection images. A hybrid model is presented, taking into account several image-based external forces and implemented using a level-set formulation. A feature vector is computed from the detected contour, which may serve as input to a dedicated classifier. The segmentation method is applied to simulated images and to clinical cases. Image segmentation results are presented and compared to two standard active contour models. Evaluation of the performance on clinical data is obtained by comparison to manual segmentation by an expert. Performance on simulated images and visual performance assessment provide further illustration of the performance of the presented approach.© (2007) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

This study evaluated electromagnetic field and specific absorption rate (SAR) changes as a function of lead resistivity on an anatomically precise head model in a 3T system. The anatomical accuracy of our head model allowed for detailed modeling of the path of DBS leads between epidermis and the outer table. Our electromagnetic finite difference time domain (FDTD) analysis showed significant changes of 1 g and 10 g averaged SAR for the range of lead resistivity modeled, including highly conductive leads up to highly resistive leads. Antenna performance and whole-head SAR were sensitive to the presence of the DBS leads only within 10%, while changes of over one order of magnitude were observed for the peak 10 g averaged SAR, suggesting that local SAR values should be considered in DBS guidelines. With ¿lead = ¿copper , and the MRI coil driven to produce a whole-head SAR without leads of 3.2 W/kg, the 1 g averaged SAR was 1080 W/kg and the 10 g averaged SAR 120 W/kg at the tip of the DBS lead. Conversely, in the control case without leads, the 1 g and 10 g averaged SAR were 0.5 W/kg and 0.6 W/kg, respectively, in the same location. The SAR at the tip of lead was similar with electrically homogeneous and electrically heterogeneous models. Our results show that computational models can support the development of novel lead technology, properly balancing the requirements of SAR deposition at the tip of the lead and power dissipation of the system battery.	agent-based model;antenna device component;antenna effect;chemical vapor deposition;coil device component;computation;computational model;computer simulation;deep brain stimulation;direct-broadcast satellite;electricity;electromagnetic fields;electron microscopy;epidermis;equilibrium;finite difference;finite-difference time-domain method;genetic heterogeneity;implants;magnetic resonance imaging;nr1i2 wt allele;patients;radio frequency;requirement;tesla coil;cisplatin/cyclophosphamide/epirubicin protocol	Leonardo M.

We want to create automatic palpation tools that achieve this same level of robustness, but real tactile sensor signals are sensitive to small physical variations and tend to drift over time. To investigate ways of achieving tactile perceptual invariance, we collected two nearly identical data sets from a SynTouch BioTac palpating at 10,260 points distributed across an artificial tissue sample made from silicone rubber with rigid embedded lumps. Each palpation interaction was distilled down to 20 numbers (19 electrode impedances and one DC pressure). Fitting a multivariate Gaussian distribution to examples recorded far from the lumps achieved near-perfect accuracy, precision, and recall in recognizing other background examples recorded the same day. These models performed miserably, though, when used to classify the other data set. Inspired by robust perceptual methods from computer vision, we transformed the 20 tactile sensor array readings into 190 binary pairwise comparisons and used the log likelihood of observing a given binary pattern to determine whether an example was far from the embedded lumps. This novel approach achieved accuracy, precision, and recall of about 80% on reserved testing data from the same day and yielded roughly similar levels of accuracy and recall with excellent precision on the data set recorded on the other day. Pairwise comparisons between tactile sensor array readings may hold promise for achieving robust automatic tactile perception.	binary pattern (image generation);computer vision;curve fitting;embedded system;precision and recall;tactile sensor	Jennifer C.

They can be corrected using either region of interest or voxel based approaches. We developed a voxel wise correction, based on the wavelet transform of two co-registered images in order to insert high resolution details of the anatomical image into the functional one. A limitation is the use of a global model which may create artefacts in the corrected image where there is no correlation between the two modalities. The aim of this work was to develop a conditional correction: a comparison between the two modalities using hidden Markov modelling and multi-resolution analysis was developed to allow such a correction. The process was successfully tested on synthetic and clinical images avoiding artefacts.	hidden markov model;image resolution;knowledge spillover;markov chain;multiresolution analysis;region of interest;synthetic data;tomography;voxel;wavelet transform	Adrien Le Pogam;Mathieu Hatt;Nicolas Boussion;Denis Guilloteau;Jean-Louis Baulieu;Caroline Prunier;Federico E.

The potentiality of this imaging modality is extended in this work by using video mosaicing techniques. Two novelties are introduced. A robust estimator based on statistics for Riemannian manifolds is developed to find a globally consistent mapping of the input frames to a common coordinate system. A mosaicing framework using an efficient scattered data fitting method is proposed in order to take into account the non-rigid deformations and the irregular sampling implied by in vivo fibered confocal microscopy. Results on 50 images of a live mouse colon demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	colon classification;curve fitting;document mosaicing;entity class - imaging modality;frame (physical object);interferometric microscopy;microscopy, confocal;modality (human–computer interaction);muscle rigidity;musculoskeletal diseases;sampling (signal processing);tissue fiber;video-in video-out;soft tissue	Tom Vercauteren;Aymeric Perchant;Xavier Pennec;Nicholas Ayache	2005	Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ...

Colonoscopy is regarded as one of the most important diagnostic tools for colorectal cancer. Indeed, colonoscopy has contributed to a decline in the number of colorectal-cancer-related deaths. Although colonoscopy has become the preferred screening modality for prevention of colorectal cancer, recent data suggest that there is a significant miss rate for the detection of large polyps and cancers, and methods to investigate why this occurs are needed. To address this problem, we present a new computer-based method that analyzes a digitized video file of a colonoscopic procedure and produces a number of metrics that likely reflect the quality of the procedure. The method consists of a set of novel image-processing algorithms designed to address new technical challenges due to uncommon characteristics of videos captured during colonoscopy. As these measurements can be obtained automatically, our method enables future quality control in large-scale day-to-day medical practice, which is currently not feasible. In addition, our method can be adapted to other endoscopic procedures such as upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, enteroscopy, and bronchoscopy. Last but not least, our method may be useful to assess progress during colonoscopy training.	bronchoscopy;cessation of life;colorectal carcinoma;digital video;endoscopy, gastrointestinal;esophagogastroduodenoscopy;image processing;neoplasms;surgical endoscopy;upper gastrointestinal tract;algorithm;enteroscopy;polyps	Jung Hwan Oh;Sae Hwang;Yu Cao;Wallapak Tavanapong;Danyu Liu;Johnny S.

Because of its painless nature, clinical usage has expanded to diagnostic purposes and therapeutic treatments. However, several issues and challenges still exist for TMS. A very limited understanding of the interaction between magnetic fields, cortical structure, and consequent brain excitation is currently available. Most previously published models lack key anatomical details that are essential elements in calculating induced electric fields critical to brain activation. In this study, gross human brain and head structures were derived using multiple modality images and a finite-element model was constructed. Furthermore, microstructural detail was incorporated using neocortical columnar structures. Using this detailed model, we investigated the influence of TMS coil position, distance and orientation on induced electric fields, and neocortical activation. Several activation standards and conductivity values were tested for their impact on the distribution of neocortical activation. Optimized activation patterns agreed well with published clinical experiments, under similar coil configurations. A structurally detailed finite-element model capable of accurately predicting neocortical activation for a given coil/magnetic field profile may provide a critical resource for understanding the electrophysiological consequences of TMS and for further refinement of this important technique.	activation function;coil gene;coil device component;electroconvulsive therapy;excitation;experiment;magnetic fields;modality (human–computer interaction);refinement (computing);scientific publication;tesla coil;transcranial magnetic stimulation;standards characteristics	Ming Chen;David J.

Validated by ray tracing through CAD drawings, the predicted maximum tolerance in RI between the solid model and the working fluid was ± 0.0005, equivalent to focusing errors commensurate with the geometric and alignment uncertainties associated with the flow model and the LDA arrangement. This technique supports predictions of the effects of refraction within a complex geometry. Where the RI mismatch is unavoidable but known, it is possible not only to calculate the true position of the measuring volume (using the probe location and model geometry), but also to estimate degradation in signal quality arising from differential displacement and refraction of the laser beams.	alignment;analog;anterior descending branch of left coronary artery;body cavities;computer-aided design;displacement mapping;doppler echocardiography;doppler effect;drawings (art);elegant degradation;framing (world wide web);heart ventricle;psychologic displacement;rs-232;ray tracing (graphics);refractive index;solid modeling;ultrasonography, doppler, transcranial;anemometry	Allen H.

We propose a novel view-angle independent prospective cardiorespiratory motion gating technique for X-ray fluoroscopy images that are used to guide cardiac electrophysiology procedures. The method is based on learning coronary sinus catheter motion using principal component analysis and then applying the derived motion model to unseen images taken at arbitrary projections. We validated our technique on 7 sequential biplane sequences in normal and very low dose scenarios and on 5 rotational sequences in normal dose. For the normal dose images we established average systole, end-inspiration and end-expiration gating success rates of 100 %, 97.4 % and 95.2 %, respectively. For very low dose applications, the method was tested on images with added noise. Average gating success rates were 93.4 %, 90 % and 93.4 % even at the low SNR value of (sqrt{5}), representing a dose reduction of more than 10 times. This technique can extract clinically useful motion information whilst minimising exposure to ionising radiation.		Maria Panayiotou;Andrew P. King;Richard James Housden;YingLiang Ma;Michael V.

Four standardized fetal parameters are measured by the proposed segmentation system: biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference and femur length. Computerized measurements of 215 fetuses are compared with manual measurements in term of fitness analysis and difference analysis. Among 215 cases, computerized measurements of 103 fetuses within 3 days of delivery are utilized in the fetal weight estimation. The EFW based on computerized measurements and manual measurements are compared by using regression analysis, artificial neural network and support vector regression. By using different estimation methods, the computerized measurements decrease the EFW errors about 40–70 g. The lowest mean absolute percentage error of EFW decrease from 6.71% for manual measurements to 4.66% for computerized measurements. The proposed fetal ultrasound image segmentation system can provide more accurate EFW in antepartum examination.	approximation error;artificial neural network;diameter (qualifier value);fetal weight;fetus;head circumference;human body weight;image segmentation;medical ultrasound;segmentation action;semiconductor industry;support vector machine;biologic segmentation	Jinhua Yu;Yuanyuan Wang;Ping Chen	2008	Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing	10.1007/s11517-008-0407-y	support vector machine;mean absolute percentage error;radiology;computer science;engineering;machine learning;image segmentation;artificial neural network;anatomy;surgery;regression analysis	ML	38.48799653018831	-80.30094972484729	54340

However, ESD is technically demanding, and potentially severe complications, such as bleeding and perforation, may occur. Energy-based techniques (e.g., radiofrequency ablation) might offer a potential alternative to ESD.

Our aim is to allow the transfer of information from preoperative modalities to intraoperative ultrasound images to aid needle placement during thermal ablation of liver metastases. The spatial relationship between ultrasound slices is obtained by tracking the probe using a Polaris optical tracking system. Images are acquired at maximum exhalation and we assume the validity of the rigid body transformation. An initial registration is carried out by picking a single corresponding point in both modalities. Our strategy is to interpret both sets of images in an automated pre-processing step to produce evidence or probabilities of corresponding structure as a pixel or voxel map. The registration algorithm converts the intensity values of the MR and ultrasound images into vessel probability values. The registration is then carried out between the vessel probability images. Results are compared to a """"bronze standard"""" registration which is calculated using a manual point/line picking algorithm and verified using visual inspection. Results show that our starting estimate is within a root mean square target registration error (calculated over the whole liver) of 15.4 mm to the """"bronze standard"""" and this is improved to 3.6 mm after running the intensity-based algorithm."""	adobe freehand;algorithm;blood vessel tissue;display resolution;expiration, function;guidance system;liver diseases;mean squared error;muscle rigidity;pixel;plant roots;polaris (poker bot);preprocessor;probability;resonance;sparse language;sparse matrix;tracking system;ultrasonography;visual inspection;voxel;intraoperative ultrasound (procedure);liver metastases;registration - actclass;thermal ablation therapy	Graeme P.

1200892250b65dde26a00fd49360e6a347828548	cascade registration of micro ct volumes taken in multiple resolutions		In this paper, we present a preliminary report of a multi-scale registration method between micro-focus X-ray CT (micro CT) volumes taken in different scales. 3D fine structures of target objects can be observed on micro CT volumes, which are difficult to observe on clinical CT volumes. Micro CT scanners can scan specimens in various resolutions. In their high resolution volumes, ultra fine structures of specimens can be observed, while scanned areas are limited to very small. On the other hand, in low resolution volumes, large areas can be captured, while fine structures of specimens are difficult to observe. The fusion volume of the high and low resolution volumes will have benefits of both. Because the difference of resolutions between the high and low resolution volumes may vary greatly, an intermediate resolution volume is required for successful fusion of volumes. To perform such volume fusion, a cascade multi-resolution registration technique is required. To register micro CT volumes that have quite different resolutions, we employ a cascade co-registration technique. In the cascade co-registration process, intermediate resolution volumes are used in a registration process of the high and low resolution volumes. In the registration between two volumes, we apply two steps registration techniques. In the first step, a block division is used to register two resolution volumes. Afterward, we estimate the fine spatial positions relating the registered two volumes using the Powell method. The registration result can be used to generate a fusion volume of the high and low resolution volumes.

Recent clinical reports have documented the magnitude of gravity-induced brain deformation in the operating room and suggest these levels of tissue motion may compromise the integrity of such systems. The authors are investigating a model-based strategy which exploits the wealth of readily-available preoperative information in conjunction with intraoperatively acquired data to construct and drive a three dimensional (3-D) computational model which estimates volumetric displacements in order to update the neuronavigational image set. Using model calculations, the preoperative image database can be deformed to generate a more accurate representation of the surgical focus during an operation. In this paper, the authors present a preliminary study of four patients that experienced substantial brain deformation from gravity and correlate cortical shift measurements with model predictions. Additionally, they illustrate their image deforming algorithm and demonstrate that preoperative image resolution is maintained. Results over the four cases show that the brain shifted, on average, 5.7 mm in the direction of gravity and that model predictions could reduce this misregistration error to an average of 1.2 mm.	computational model;document completion status - documented;estimated;experience;image resolution;instrument - device;operating room;patients;science of neurosurgery;series - set of composite instances;surgical instruments;algorithm	Michael I.

Therefore, the inhomogeneities in the field are routinely minimized by shimming prior to imaging. However in fMRI, the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) effect is the measure of interest, so the BOLD sensitivity (BS) should be optimized rather than the magnetic field homogeneity. The analytical expression for an estimate of the BOLD sensitivity has been recently developed, allowing for the computation of BOLD sensitivity maps from echo-planar images and field maps. This report describes a novel shimming procedure that optimizes the local BOLD sensitivity over a region of interest. The method is applied in vivo and compared to a standard global shimming procedure. A breath-holding experiment was carried out and demonstrated that the BS-based shimming significantly improved the detection of activation in a target region of interest, the medial orbitofrontal cortex.	breath of fire iii;computation (action);distortion;magnetic fields;magnetic resonance imaging;map;medial graph;region of interest;shims;video-in video-out;blood oxygen level dependent;cellular targeting;fmri	Evelyne Balteau;Chloe Hutton;Nikolaus Weiskopf	2010		10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.08.010	psychology;computer simulation;shim;communication noise;radiology;medicine;electromagnetic field;magnetic field;magnetic resonance imaging;time series;respiratory physiology;oxygen;nuclear medicine;region of interest	Vision	45.28687238090757	-83.42722924324131	55310

The evaluation of the images is now only visual, while standardization procedures and quantitative methods could be very useful instruments to optimize the diagnostic performances. We propose a new method to evaluate the fat infiltration in tissues developed and retrospectively applied to images of the human leg. Through a muscle segmentation algorithm on structural T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs), the estimated non-muscle percentage (eNMP) in the segmented muscle area has been evaluated in healthy subjects as a reference value. A semi-automated procedure allows extending the algorithm to MRIs of NMD patients. A strong correlation has been demonstrated between this index and the disease severity. The final aim is to obtain a quantitative evaluation of fat infiltration percentage and to relate it to the grade of muscle impairment in subjects affected by Neuromuscular Diseases.	algorithm;file allocation table;performance;resonance;semiconductor industry	Maria Evelina Fantacci;Chiara Sottocornola;Alessandra Retico;Guja Astrea;Roberta Battini;Michela Tosetti	2015	2015 IEEE International Symposium on Medical Measurements and Applications (MeMeA) Proceedings	10.1109/MeMeA.2015.7145175	radiology;medicine;pathology;anatomy	Vision	37.64403731586722	-80.8570923995596	55350

Current methods to solve this problem require a long-duration stimulus pulse which could lead to electrode corrosion and nerve damage. The hypothesis that the excitability of specific diameter fibers can be suppressed by reshaping the profile of extracellular potential along the axon using multiple electrodes is tested using computer simulations in two different volume conductors. Simulations in a homogenous medium with a nine-contact electrode array show that the current excitation threshold (I/sub th/) of large diameter axons (13-17 /spl mu/m) (0.6-3.0 mA) is higher than that of small-diameter axons (2-7 /spl mu/m) (0.4-0.7 mA) with 200-/spl mu/m axon-electrode distance and 10-/spl mu/s stimulus pulse. The electrode array is also tested in a three-dimensional finite-element model of the sacral root model of dog (ventral root of S3). A single cathode activates large-diameter axons before activating small axons. However, a nine-electrode array activates 50% of small axons while recruiting only 10% of large ones and activates 90% of small axons while recruiting only 50% of large ones. The simulations suggest that the near-physiological recruitment order can be achieved with an electrode array. The diameter selectivity of the electrode array can be controlled by the electrode separation and the method is independent of pulse width.	auditory recruitment;axon;axonal transport;bone structure of sacrum;computer simulation;diameter (qualifier value);excitation;excited state;muscle contraction;myelin sheath;peripheral nerves;pulse-width modulation;selectivity (electronic);skeletal muscle structure;tissue fiber;tooth root structure;electrode;nerve injury;width	Zeng Lertmanorat;Dominique M.

e6be7e46fea13f44223b371877f0138a0b5912a1	a minimally interactive method to segment enlarged lymph nodes in 3d thoracic ct images using a rotatable spiral-scanning technique	cancer;melanoma;computer programming;statistical analysis;scanning;diseases and disorders;lymphoma	Precise size measurement of enlarged lymph nodes is a significant indicator for diagnosing malignancy, follow-up and therapy monitoring of cancer diseases. The presence of diverse sizes and shapes, inhomogeneous enhancement and the adjacency to neighboring structures with similar intensities, make the segmentation task challenging. We present a semi-automatic approach requiring minimal user interactions to fast and robustly segment the enlarged lymph nodes. First, a stroke approximating the largest diameter of a specific lymph node is drawn manually from which a volume of interest (VOI) is determined. Second, Based on the statistical analysis of the intensities on the dilated stroke area, a region growing procedure is utilized within the VOI to create an initial segmentation of the target lymph node. Third, a rotatable spiral-scanning technique is proposed to resample the 3D boundary surface of the lymph node to a 2D boundary contour in a transformed polar image. The boundary contour is found by seeking the optimal path in 2D polar image with dynamic programming algorithm and eventually transformed back to 3D. Ultimately, the boundary surface of the lymph node is determined using an interpolation scheme followed by post-processing steps. To test the robustness and efficiency of our method, a quantitative evaluation was conducted with a dataset of 315 lymph nodes acquired from 79 patients with lymphoma and melanoma. Compared to the reference segmentations, an average Dice coefficient of 0.88 with a standard deviation of 0.08, and an average absolute surface distance of 0.54mm with a standard deviation of 0.48mm, were achieved.© (2012) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

b57d0de564b8a9743e40c9d29bec38a44e5f168c	observer variability experiment using a four-primary display and its relationship with physiological factors.		There exist individual differences in color matching functions and the use of a single standard observer as a representative of a whole population often limits the accuracy of color reproduction, especially for narrowband stimuli. We conducted a paired comparison experiment for 58 color-normal people involving color difference judgments using four nearly metameric spectra pairs. The performance of observer functions: CIEPO06, Sarkar’s observers, and the extended CIEPO06 incorporating peak-shift in L and M cones were investigated. Large observer variability was found in the obtained results, which is much larger than what CIEPO06 predicts. At least two different groups were found in the experimental results, which could be explained by eye-lens and macular pigment optical density variations. We estimated the individual cone fundamentals from another experiment where observers performed five color matching, and used them to predict the paired comparison results. They gave better, or at least comparable prediction to those of CIE 1964 observer and CIEPO06. Introduction The CIE 1931 standard colorimetric observer and the CIE 1964 standard colorimetric observer, also known as 2◦and 10◦(standard) observers, have satisfied industries for many decades. However, the advent of narrowband stimuli such as lasers and LEDs used in monitors, TVs, mobile displays, or cinema projection is changing this situation. The use of a standard observer is based on the assumption that a single observer or a single set of color matching functions (CMFs) can reasonably represent a whole population of people with normal color vision. If narrowband stimuli such as lasers and LEDs are observed, however, they magnify the individual differences in CMFs and this assumption often breaks [1, 2, 3]. Researchers have tackled this problem and proposed methods to evaluate observer metamerism, which are summarized below. Related Work In mid-20th century, devices to evaluate observer and illuminant metamerism were invented. They include Glenn Color Rule [4], Davidson and Hemmendinger Color Rule (D&H Color Rule) [5], and Macbeth Matchpoint. These devices have a series of color patches arranged in pairs. The observer’s task is to find a pair of patches that appear the same according to their perception. Thus, using different illuminations and a single observer allows us to evaluate illuminant metamerism and using different observers and a single illumination allows us to evaluate observer metamerism. A number of researches have been performed using D&H Color Rule with respect to observer metamerism evaluation [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. In 1989, the CIE proposed a ”Standard Deviate Observer”, a method to evaluate observer metamerism [12, 13]. However, it is reported that the standard deviate observer significantly underestimates observer variability [14, 15]. In 2006, the CIE proposed a model [16] (CIEPO06) that computes cone fundamentals by specifying an observer’s age and a field size. It allows us to generate a number of theoretical observers and use them to evaluate observer metamerism. In 2011, Sarkar [17, 18] proposed observer categories by analyzing 47 individual CMFs of Stiles and Burch data, and 61 CIE 2006 CMFs using cluster analysis. In a test experiment, forty-nine human observers were classified into nine categories (including CIE 1964 observer as one category) using an observer calibrator prototype [19], which displays two different spectra side by side in a bipartite field. The performance of these eight observer categories is not widely verified and needs more investigation. Research Objective Most of the observer variability experiments in the past involve colors appearing as unrelated colors, comparison of adjoining stimuli, a single bipartite field, and/or monocular view, which might be different from practical viewing conditions. Our goal in this study was to conduct an experiment under more practical viewing conditions, to see how much observer variability we would obtain, and to see if observer functions such as CIEPO06 and Sarkar’s observers cover the variability of human observers. Note that it is not our purpose to seek for better standard observer functions or to investigate the accuracy of standard observer functions. Experiment and Analysis Overview To achieve our goal, we designed a paired comparison experiment using SHARP Quattron display. Quattron is a display having four primaries, R, G, B, and Y (for Yellow) with 10-bit assignment that enables us to produce metameric spectra on a single display. The spectral power distributions (SPDs) of the four primaries are shown in Figure 1. Four nearly metameric spectra pairs are generated and used in the experiment. One metameric pair consists of two color patches: One patch is made from red, green, and blue primaries. The other patch is made from blue and yellow primaries. Figure 2 illustrates the experiment workflow. Paired comparison is the method that several stimulus intensity levels are chosen (four color difference levels in this case) and compared pair-wise repeatedly.

An image processing pipeline that addresses these limitations was developed and tested. The principal sequences acquired in fetal MRI clinical practice are multiple orthogonal single-shot fast spin echo scans. State-of-the-art image processing techniques were used for inter-slice motion correction and super-resolution reconstruction of high-resolution volumetric images from these scans. The reconstructed volume images were processed with intensity non-uniformity correction and the fetal brain extracted by using supervised automated segmentation. Reconstruction, segmentation and volumetry of the fetal brains for a cohort of twenty-five clinically acquired fetal MRI scans was done. Performance metrics for volume reconstruction, segmentation and volumetry were determined by comparing to manual tracings in five randomly chosen cases. Finally, analysis of the fetal brain and parenchymal volumes was performed based on the gestational age of the fetuses. The image processing pipeline developed in this study enables volume rendering and accurate fetal brain volumetry by addressing the limitations of current volumetry techniques, which include dependency on motion-free scans, manual segmentation, and inaccurate thick-slice interpolation.	addresses (publication format);brain;ct scan;circuit complexity;extraction;fetus;image processing;image resolution;interpolation imputation technique;randomness;ruby;scanning;spin echo;super-resolution imaging;supervised learning;twenty five;volume rendering;x-ray computed tomography;biologic segmentation;emotional dependency	Ali Gholipour;Judy A.

We apply 120 W of power through an 8-mm electrode for a 120-s duration, with distances from 0 to 3 mm between electrode and myocardium, to create lesions in myocardium. We apply flow rates of 1, 3, and 5 L/min to determine their effect. Results show that with an optimal distance from 0.5 to 1.5 mm between electrode and myocardium, we increase lesion depth from 7.5 mm for contact ablation to 9.5 mm for noncontact ablation. For different flow rates, the optimal distance various. The effect of flow rate is not obvious. Higher flow rate does not lead to a deeper lesion.	artificial cardiac pacemaker;cardiac ablation;computer cooling;cool - action;distance;hearing loss, high-frequency;maxima and minima;myocardium;radio frequency;tachycardia;tachycardia, ventricular	Jie Zhang;Jang-Zern Tsai;Hong Cao;Yi Chen;James A.

The current surgical approach, which includes pulmonary valve replacement/insertion (PVR), has yielded mixed results. MRI-based patient- specific RV/LV/Patch combination models which included fluid-structure interactions (FSI), anisotropic material properties and two-layer construction with fiber orientations were introduced to test the hypothesis that a PVR surgical design with a smaller patch and more aggressive scar tissue trimming would lead to improved RV cardiac function recovery. Results from our models validated by pre-operation data indicated that the small patch design had 10% improvement in RV function as measured by RV ejection fraction, compared to the conventional patch. Maximum Stress-P1 value from the anisotropic model was 149.6% higher than that from the isotropic model. Computational RV volume predictions agreed well with CMR-measured volume data (error < 3%).	anisotropic diffusion;computation;computer simulation;consistency model;digital video recorder;experiment;insertion sort;interaction;logical volume management;stanford university centers and institutes	Chun Yang;Dalin Tang;Tal Geva;Pedro J. del Nido	2008	2008 International Conference on BioMedical Engineering and Informatics	10.1109/BMEI.2008.66	magnetoresistance;medical imaging;multidisciplinary design optimization;radiology;cardiac function curve;regression model validation;solid modeling;computational model;anisotropy;ejection fraction;heart;surgery;cardiology	Visualization	30.949906349423443	-85.48612446614811	56248

A computational model of extracellular stimulation that captures the effect of neurite orientation in anisotropic tissue is developed using a modified version of the standard volume conductor model, known as the cellular composite model, embedded in a four layer model of the retina. Simulations are conducted to investigate the interaction of neural tissue orientation, electrode placement, and stimulation pulse duration and amplitude. Using appropriate multiple electrode configurations and higher frequency stimulation, preferential activation of the axon initial segment is shown to be possible for a range of realistic electrode-retina separation distances. These results establish a quantitative relationship between the time-course of stimulation and physical properties of the tissue, such as fiber orientation.	axon initial segment;computation (action);computational model;computer simulation;distance;electric stimulation technique;embedded system;embedding;fiber to the x;functional electrical stimulation;ganglion cell;nerve fibers;nerve tissue;neuroprosthetics;physical phenomenon or property;prosthesis;pulse duration;retina;retinal ganglion cells;tissue fiber	Timothy B Esler;Anthony N.

67821764886f13027061f26e4f961c063d99c8e9	smoothing lung segmentation surfaces in 3d x-ray ct images using anatomic guidance	computed tomography;root mean square difference;signal attenuation;lung;x ray ct;smoothing;computing systems;similarity index	Several methods for automatic lung segmentation in volumetric computed tomography (CT) images have been proposed. Most methods distinguish the lung parenchyma from the surrounding anatomy based on the difference in CT attenuation values. This can lead to an irregular and inconsistent lung boundary for the regions near the mediastinum. This paper presents a fully automatic method for the 3D smoothing of the lung boundary using information from the segmented human airway tree. First, using the segmented airway tree we define a bounding box around the mediastinum for each lung, within which all operations are performed. We then define all generations of the airway tree distal to the right and left mainstem bronchi to be part of the respective lungs, and exclude all other segments. Finally, we perform a fast morphological closing with an ellipsoidal kernel to smooth the surface of the lung. This method has been tested by processing the segmented lungs from eight normal datasets. The mean value of the magnitude of curvature of the contours of mediastinal transverse slices, averaged over all the datasets, is 0.0450 before smoothing and 0.0167 post smoothing. The accuracy of the lung contours after smoothing is assessed by comparing the automatic results to manually traced smooth lung borders by a human analyst. Averaged over all volumes, the root mean square difference between human and computer borders is 0.8691 mm after smoothing, compared to 1.3012 mm before. The mean similarity index, which is an area overlap measure based on the kappa statistic, is 0.9958 (SD 0.0032).	ct scan;closing (morphology);kappa calculus;mathematical morphology;mean squared error;minimum bounding box;smoothing;tomography;transverse wave	Soumik Ukil;Joseph M.

Especially in children with congenital heart disease, segmentation should be based on the echo features solely since a priori knowledge on the shape of the heart cannot be used. Segmentation of echocardiographic images is challenging because of the low echogenicity of the myocardium in some regions. High resolution information derived from radio frequency (rf) ultrasound data might be a useful additional feature in these regions. A semi-3D technique was used to determine maximum temporal cross-correlation values from the rf-data. To segment the endocardial surface, maximum cross-correlation values were used as additional external force in a deformable model approach and were tested against and combined with adaptive filtered, demodulated rf-data. The method was tested on pediatric full volume images (Philips, iE33) and evaluated by comparison with contours obtained from manual segmentation.	cross-correlation;radio frequency	Maartje M.

b4040823a852eb88c1b7f0d0db4ab1e8ed790d38	nurbs curves with the application of multiple bones fracture reconstruction		The challenging task of treating trauma to cranio-maxillofacial requires advanced radiological imaging and high clinical skills. The reconstruction of facial fractures focuses on the rehabilitation of patients functionally as well as in aesthetics. In this article we used NURBS curves to construct the multiple bones fracture using CT scan data in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format. The reconstruction process of multiple bones fracture start with the boundary extraction followed by corner detection, optimization of knots, weights, construction of fractured part inner outer curve for each CT scan slice using NURBS curves and finally the construction of fractured part in DICOM format. The construction process using proposed method is based on DICOM data only that does not require any technique such as technical help, mirror imaging, to take average thickness of skull bone or reference skull, etc. The constructed fractured implant is custom made for each patient. We present a real case in which multiple bones fracture has been constructed using NURBS curves. The proposed method has also been validated quantitatively and qualitatively using self supposed fractured data. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

While existing techniques are mature from a technical point of view, managing the complexity of visual parameters is still difficult for nonexpert users. To this end, this paper presents new ideas to facilitate the specification of optical properties for direct volume rendering. We introduce an additional level of abstraction for parametric models of transfer functions. The proposed framework allows visualization experts to design high-level transfer function models which can intuitively be used by non-expert users. The results are user interfaces which provide semantic information for specialized visualization problems.

In many cases surgical interventions, such as spinal fusion, are unavoidable. An appropriate method for the estimation of the mechanical effects of such interventions to adjacent vertebral segments is the mathematical computer simulation. This paper presents a 3D- Multi Body Simulation- (MBS-) model of the lumbar spine with realistic surfaces of vertebrae and correct positioning relative to each other which is based on computer tomography (CT) measurements and segmentation processes. Intersegmental discs as well as ligament structures are included. For these elements the physical behavior like force-deformation relations and characteristic curves for the torque-angle relations are formulated. The facet joints are modeled as cartilage, in order to simulate the contact between the corresponding articular surfaces. With this model the loads on the different structures, before and after spinal fusion of the functional spine unit L5-L4, are calculated to show the biomechanical effects to adjacent vertebral segments under different load cases. The comparison of the simulations shows a redistribution of loads within the spinal structures. In the simulation case of spinal fusion, the posterior structures are more loaded than in the simulated healthy state. The validation of the model was carried out by comparing the results with FE-simulations, various in vitro experiments and experimental data from biomedical literature.	ct scan;computer simulation;dendritic spine;experiment;tomography	Sabine Bauer;Urs Buchholz	2013	2013 European Modelling Symposium	10.1109/EMS.2013.28	engineering;biological engineering;anatomy;surgery	Robotics	29.898606381701264	-84.64954850353698	57406

When querying a particular CT scan, the user is often not interested in the complete scan but in a certain region of interest (ROI). Unfortunately, specifying the ROI in terms of scan coordinates is usually not an option because an ROI is usually specified w.r.t. the scan content, e.g. an example region in another scan. Thus, the system usually retrieves the complete scan and the user has to navigate to the ROI manually. In addition to the time to navigate, there is a large overhead for loading and transferring the irrelevant parts of the scan. In this paper, we propose a method for answering ROI queries which are specified by an example ROI in another scan. An important feature of our new approach is that it is not necessary to annotate the query or the result scan before query processing. Since our method is based on image similarity, it is very flexible w.r.t. the size and the position of the scanned region. To answer ROI queries, our new method employs instance-based regression in combination with interpolation techniques for mapping the slices of a scan to a height model of the human body. Furthermore, we propose an efficient search algorithm on the result scan for retrieving the ROI with high accuracy. In the experimental evaluation, we examine the prediction accuracy and the saved I/O costs of our new method on a repository of 2 526 CT scans.	ct scan;database;executable;experiment;input/output;interpolation;map;overhead (computing);raster graphics;region of interest;relevance;robert;search algorithm;tomography;visual descriptor	Alexander Cavallaro;Franz Graf;Hans-Peter Kriegel;Matthias Schubert;Marisa Thoma	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-22922-0_5	computer vision;human body;computer science;data mining;computed tomography;search algorithm;computer graphics (images);region of interest	DB	36.86571282972111	-89.21103280369427	57747
4c5988a32a581848aa67f2aba74a313e3dcce1de	optimum mechanical behavior of calcium phosphate cement/hydroxyl group functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes/bovine serum albumin composite using metaheuristic algorithms	ts manufactures	Injectable calcium phosphate cements have been introduced as adjuncts to internal fixation for treating selected fractures. These cements harden without producing much heat, develop compressive strength, and are remodeled slowly in vivo. The main purpose of the cement is to fill voids in metaphyseal bone, thereby reducing the need for bone graft. However, such cements may also improve the holding strength around metal devices in osteoporotic bone. This paper presents the optimum mechanical behavior of calcium phosphate cement/hydroxyl group functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes/bovine serum albumin (CPC/MWCNT-OH/BSA) composites in terms of compressive strength using well-known metaheuristic optimizers. The process parameters studied were wt% of MWCNT-OH (0.2–0.5 wt%) and wt% of BSA (5–15 wt%). The obtained results from metaheuristic algorithms were compared with the results from the response surface methodology (RSM) in the literature. The results obtained from metaheuristic algorithms outperformed the results given by the RSM in terms of less error percentage and high compressive strength.	algorithm;bioinformatics;cartesian perceptual compression;genetic algorithm;grafting (decision trees);hardening (computing);mathematical model;mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;particle swarm optimization;phase-shift oscillator;response surface methodology;serum metabolome database;simulated annealing;software release life cycle;video-in video-out	Ali Sadollah;Ardeshir Bahreininejad;Mohd Hamdi;Judha Purbolaksono	2012	Neural Computing and Applications	10.1007/s00521-012-1219-4	computer science	HCI	28.81771076162198	-84.51798582261839	57803

We therefore developed a method to qualify flow quantification technologies using a physical compartment exchange phantom and image analysis tool. We validate and demonstrate utility of this method using dynamic PET and SPECT. Dynamic image sequences were acquired on two PET/CT and a cardiac dedicated SPECT (with and without attenuation and scatter corrections) systems. A two-compartment exchange model was fit to image derived time-activity curves to quantify flow rates. Flowmeter measured flow rates (20-300 mL/min) were set prior to imaging and were used as reference truth to which image derived flow rates were compared. Both PET cameras had excellent agreement with truth (r2> 0.94). High-end PET had no significant bias (p > 0.05) while lower-end PET had minimal slope bias (wash-in and wash-out slopes were 1.02 and 1.01) but no significant reduction in precision relative to high-end PET (<;15% vs. <;14% limits of agreement, p > 0.3). SPECT (without scatter and attenuation corrections) slope biases were noted (0.85 and 1.32) and attributed to camera saturation in early time frames. Analysis of wash-out rates from non-saturated, late time frames resulted in excellent agreement with truth (r2= 0.98, slope = 0.97). Attenuation and scatter corrections did not significantly impact SPECT performance. The proposed phantom, software and quality assurance paradigm can be used to qualify imaging instrumentation and protocols for quantification of kinetic rate parameters using dynamic imaging.	anatomical compartments;dynamic imaging;flowmeters;frame (physical object);image analysis;instrument - device;inter-rater reliability;kinetics;maxima and minima;multi-compartment model;multimodal imaging;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;polyethylene terephthalate;programming paradigm;protocols documentation;quantitation;slope number;small-bias sample space	Hanif Gabrani-Juma;Owen J.

However, the method is transferable to other structures, e. g., vessels. Since 3D surface models are extracted from binary segmentation masks, the curvature orientation is rough and noisy and the final hatching direction is falsified. The goal of this work is the correction and the completely automated computation of the hatching direction.	computation	Christian Tietjen;Rocco Gasteiger;Alexandra Baer;Bernhard Preim	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-78640-5_24	anatomy	Vision	40.19275325165599	-80.43035093802001	57988
f3a1586b1445a6063da6faf8fcdd878d7cdf1f24	2d versus 3d fluoroscopy-based navigation in posterior pelvic fixation: review of the literature on current technology	computed tomography;sacroiliac screw fixation;3d fluoroscopy based navigation;pelvic ring injuries;2d fluoroscopy based navigation	Percutaneous sacroiliac (SI) fixation of unstable posterior pelvic ring injuries is a widely accepted procedure. The complex sacral anatomy with narrow osseous corridors for SI screw placement makes this procedure technically challenging. Techniques are constantly evolving as a result of better understanding of the posterior pelvic anatomy. Recently developed tools include fluoroscopy-based computer-assisted navigation, which can be two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D). Our goal is to determine the relevant technical considerations and clinical outcomes associated with these modalities by reviewing the published research. We hypothesize that 3D fluoroscopy-based navigation is safer and superior to its 2D predecessor with respect to lower radiation dose and more accurate SI screw placement. We searched four medical databases to identify English-language studies of 2D and 3D fluoroscopy-based navigation from January 1990 through August 2015. We included articles reporting imaging techniques and outcomes of closed posterior pelvic ring fixation with percutaneous SI screw fixation. Injuries included in the study were sacral fractures (52 patients), sacroiliac fractures (88 patients), lateral compression fractures (20 patients), and anteroposterior compression type pelvic fractures (8 patients). We excluded articles on open reduction of posterior pelvic ring injuries and solely anatomic studies. We then reviewed these studies for technical considerations and outcomes associated with these technologies. Six studies were included in our analysis. Results of these studies indicate that 3D fluoroscopy-based navigation is associated with a lower radiation dose and lower rate of screw malpositioning compared with 2D fluoroscopy-based systems. It may be advantageous to combine modern imaging modalities such as 3D fluoroscopy with computer-assisted navigation for percutaneous screw fixation in the posterior pelvis.	anatomic structures;bone tissue;bone structure of sacrum;compression fracture;computational anatomy;computer case screws;conflict (psychology);consent forms;control theory;database;exclusion;exposure to radiation;fluoroscopy;imaging techniques;lateral thinking;manuscripts;navigation;pathological fracture;patients;review [publication type];scientific publication;screw;stress fractures;unstable medical device problem;sacroiliac;standards characteristics	Savyasachi C.

Previously reported fully automatic and interactive methods for coronary artery extraction were optimized and integrated into a user-friendly workflow. The user’s waiting time is saved by running the non-supervised coronary artery segmentation and centerline tracking in the background as soon as the images are received. When the user opens the data, the software provides an intuitive interactive analysis environment. The average overlap between the centerline created in our software and the reference standard was 96.0%. The average distance between them was 0.38 mm. The automatic procedure runs for 1.4–2.5 min as a single-thread application in the background. Interactive processing takes 3 min in average. In preliminary experiments, the software achieved higher efficiency than the former interactive method, and reasonable accuracy compared to manual vessel extraction.	bibliographic database;blood vessel tissue;cpu (central processing unit of computer system);central processing unit;experiment;heart failure;human–computer interaction;imagery;maxima and minima;multistage interconnection networks;physics and astronomy classification scheme;physiologic calcification;reference standards;segmentation action;silo (dataset);stani michiels;structure of parenchyma of lung;thread (computing);usability;workstation;biologic segmentation	Chunliang Wang;Örjan Smedby	2009	International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery	10.1007/s11548-009-0393-z	computer vision;radiology;medicine	Visualization	37.67227690045664	-82.84707720260187	58210

This study tailors application of the so-called Gradient Projection for Sparse Reconstruction (GPSR) to large-scale time-difference three-dimensional electrical impedance tomography (3D EIT). 3D EIT typically suffers from the need for a large number of voxels to cover the whole domain, so its application to real-time imaging, for example monitoring of lung function, remains scarce since the large number of degrees of freedom of the problem extremely increases storage space and reconstruction time. This study shows the great potential of the GPSR for large-size time-difference 3D EIT. Further studies are needed to improve its accuracy for imaging small-size anomalies.	characteristic impedance;electromagnetically induced transparency;gradient;greedy perimeter stateless routing in wireless networks;mathematical optimization;mental suffering;radioisotope scan of lung;real-time clock;respiratory physiology;solver;sparse approximation;sparse matrix;structure of parenchyma of lung;tomography;voxel;electric impedance	Ashkan Javaherian;Manuchehr Soleimani;Knut Möller	2015	Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing	10.1007/s11517-015-1441-1	mathematical optimization;calculus;mathematics;geometry	HPC	51.77470194750344	-80.719044035715	58428

To overcome the rapid intensity change due to contrast enhancement, we propose to register the observed sequence to a pseudo ground truth, which is a motion/noise free sequence that is estimated from the observed one, and having almost identical intensity variations as the original sequence. The pseudo ground truth and the elastic deformation fields for the observed sequence are obtained by minimizing an energy functional integrating both the registration error and the spatiotemporal constraints on the pseudo ground truth in an expectation-maximization framework. We have tested the proposed nonrigid registration method on 20 cardiac perfusion MR scans. The proposed method successfully compensated the elastic deformation of the heart in most scans according to visual validation. For quantitative validation, we propagated manually drawn myocardial contours in one frame to other frames according to the deformation fields obtained by applying different registration methods. The root mean square distance between the propagated contour and the gold standard is 2.11mm if only global translation is compensated, and 1.87mm after nonrigid registration, as compared with 2.80mm for serial demons registration and 2.77mm for a free-form deformation approach using normalized mutual information as the similarity measure, both of which adversely increased the error due to misregistration.

It can measure the blood flow of fetal heart. At the same time as a normal ultrasound, it can show by creating a 2D image on screen how the fetal heart is beating. This information can actually be used to obtain information of fetal heart rate. The method of contour tracing is used to separate fetal heart from its background. There are some parts of the heart moving but only the atrium area is selected as a beating reference. The measuring success of fetal heart rate compare to medical test is about 88.82% by six-recorded 2D ultrasound.	doppler echocardiography;gaussian blur;pixel	David H.

Acquisition is a two-step process, first involving a 3D laser scanner to get a 3D surface, and then a high resolution camera for capturing the texture. This acquisition process is repeated at each step of the dissection, depending on the expected accuracy and the specific objects to be studied. Thanks to fiducial markers, surfaces are registered on each others. Experts can then explore data using interaction hardware in an immersive 3D visualization. An interactive labeling tool is provided to the anatomist, in order to identify regions of interest on each acquired surface. 3D objects can then be reconstructed according to the selected surfaces. We aim to produce ground truths which for instance can be used to validate data acquired with MRI. The system is applied to the specific case of white fibers reconstruction in the human brain.	biological specimen;brain;cdisc send biospecimens terminology;checking (action);data acquisition;display resolution;distortion;fiducial marker;ground truth;image resolution;imagery;physical object;region of interest;registration;scanner device component;scanning systems;tissue dissection;tissue fiber;tracer;volume rendering;wrapping (graphics);algorithm	Barthélemy Serres;Ilyess Zemmoura;Christophe Destrieux;Frédéric Andersson;Clovis Tauber;Gilles Venturini	2011	2011 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6091106	iterative reconstruction;three-dimensional space;computer vision;visualization;radiology;medicine;surface reconstruction;laser;ground truth;engineering;magnetic resonance imaging;biological engineering;data acquisition;computer graphics (images);region of interest	Visualization	41.15436232234781	-85.53022620520848	59193

For achieving this ambitious goal, it is necessary to find and develop new methods and technologies and to applicate them. The issue of localizing a range of devices inside the human body is one of them. Solution to this problem would enable the upsurge of nanorobots (nanobots) for micro-operations, application of strong medicine on limited areas to lessen its side effects, conducting the nanotoxicology reports or reducing the discomfort of some invasive procedures like endoscopy. In this paper, the focus is on the latter and an example of an endoscopy with a pill is given. Due to maximizing the effectiveness of endoscopy by the use of the pill there is a need for optimizing the technology used for its localization.

The beam is produced by a linear accelerator which is moved by a jointed mechanism. Radiation is concentrated by crossfiring at the tumor from multiple directions and the amount of energy deposited in normal brain tissues is reduced. Because access to the tumor is obstructed along some directions by critical regions (e.g., brainstem, optic nerves) and most tumors are not shaped like spheres, planning the path of the beam is often difficult and time-consuming. This paper describes a computer-based planner developed to assist the surgeon generate a satisfactory path, given the spatial distribution of the brain tissues obtained with medical imaging. Experimental results with the implemented planner are presented, including a comparison with manually generated paths. According to these results, automatic planning significantly improves energy deposition. It can also shorten the overall treatment, hence reducing the patient’s pain and allowing the radiosurgery equipment to be used for more patients. Stereot axic radiosurgery is an example of so-called “bloodless surgery”. Computer-based planning techniques are expected to facilitate further development of this safer, less painful, and more cost effective type of surgery.	chemical vapor deposition;medical imaging;motion planning;physical vapor deposition;planner	Achim Schweikard;John R.

Objectives were an image signal-to-noise ratio superior to standard designs throughout the human brain, as well as high parallel imaging performance. Electro-magnetic field simulations were used to determine array diameter and inter-element coil gap. Low mutual inductive coupling was achieved at 1.5 and 3.0 T using high-impedance pre-amplifiers. Coils show an average SNR improvement over commercial birdcage coils of 2.4 and 2.3 for the 1.5 T and 3.0 T design, respectively. The mean of the noise-amplification factor related to reconstruction of under-sampled data (gfactor) was 1.03 for 2-fold under-sampled data (rate-2) and 1.22 for rate-3 at 1.5 T.

Here we propose and evaluate a wavelet synergistic approach that combines functional and structural information from a number of sources (CT, MRI and anatomical probabilistic atlases) for the accurate quantitative recovery of radioactivity concentration in PET images. When the method is combined with anatomical probabilistic atlases, the outcome is a functional volume corrected for partial volume effects.   METHODS The proposed method is based on the multiresolution property of the wavelet transform. First, the target PET image and the corresponding anatomical image (CT/MRI/atlas-based segmented MRI) are decomposed into several resolution elements. Secondly, high-resolution components of the PET image are replaced, in part, with those of the anatomical image after appropriate scaling. The amount of structural input is weighted by the relative high frequency signal content of the two modalities. The method was validated on a digital Zubal phantom and clinical data to evaluate its quantitative potential.   RESULTS Simulation studies showed the expected relationship between functional recovery and the amount of correct structural detail provided, with perfect recovery achieved when true images were used as anatomical reference. The use of T1-MRI images brought significant improvements in PET image resolution. However improvements were maximized when atlas-based segmented images as anatomical references were used; these results were replicated in clinical data sets.   CONCLUSION The synergistic use of functional and structural data, and the incorporation of anatomical probabilistic information in particular, generates morphologically corrected PET images of exquisite quality.	atlases;ct scan;cervical atlas;clustered file system;image resolution;image scaling;pet/ct scan;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;polyethylene terephthalate;positron-emission tomography;positrons;probabilistic database;radioactivity;rapid refresh;simulation;synergy;tomography, emission-computed, single-photon;wavelet transform;x-ray computed tomography	Miho Shidahara;Charalampos Tsoumpas;Alexander Hammers;Nicolas Boussion;Dimitris Visvikis;Tetsuya Suhara;Iwao Kanno;Federico E.

CS has shown promising results in accelerating dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI). CS based approaches hugely rely on sparsifying transforms to reconstruct the dynamic MR images from its undersampled k-space data. Recent developments in dictionary learning and nonlinear kernel based methods have shown to be capable of representing dynamic images more sparsely than conventional linear transforms. In this paper, we propose a novel method (NL-D) to represent the dMRI more sparsely using self-learned nonlinear dictionaries based on kernel methods. Based on the proposed model, a new iterative approach for image reconstruction relying on pre-image reconstruction is developed within CS framework. Simulation results have shown that the proposed method outperforms the conventional CS approaches based on linear sparsifying transforms.	compressed sensing;dictionary;iterative method;iterative reconstruction;kernel method;machine learning;nl (complexity);nonlinear system;programming paradigm;resonance;signal processing;simulation	Ukash Nakarmi;Yanhua Wang;Jingyuan Lyu;Leslie Ying	2015	2015 IEEE 12th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)	10.1109/ISBI.2015.7163880	iterative reconstruction;computer vision;kernel;radiology;medicine;computer science;magnetic resonance imaging;machine learning;pattern recognition;mathematics;compressed sensing;principal component analysis	Vision	50.46907555930672	-80.69377778087221	60107

Noninvasive imaging methods play a critical role in diagnosing SCI and monitoring the response to therapy. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), by the virtue of providing excellent soft tissue contrast, is the most promising imaging method for this application. However, spinal cord has a very small cross-section, which needs high-resolution images for better visualization and diagnosis. Acquiring high-resolution spinal cord MRI images requires long acquisition time due to the physical and physiological constraints. Moreover, long acquisition time makes MRI more susceptible to motion artifacts. In this paper, we studied the application of compressive sensing (CS) and parallel imaging to achieve high-resolution imaging from sparsely sampled and reduced k-space data acquired by parallel receive arrays. In particular, the studies are limited to the effects of 2D Cartesian sampling with different subsampling schemes and reduction factors. The results show that compressive sensing parallel MRI has the potential to provide high-resolution images of the spinal cord in 1/3 of the acquisition time required by the conventional methods.	calcium-sensing receptor;cartesian closed category;chroma subsampling;compressed sensing;image resolution;imagery;magnetic resonance imaging;morphologic artifacts;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;spinal cord injuries;spinal cord neoplasms;soft tissue	Peng Li;Xiangdong Yu;Jay F.

Integrated PET/CT systems provide the opportunity to combine morphologic with functional information. We have developed algorithms which allow the user to track both tumor volume and standardized uptake value (SUV) measurements during the therapy from series of CT and PET images, respectively. To prepare for tumor volume estimation we have developed a new technique for a fast, flexible, and intuitive 3D definition of meshes. This initial surface is then automatically adapted by means of a model-based segmentation algorithm and propagated to each follow-up scan. If necessary, manual corrections can be added by the user. To determine SUV measurements a prioritized region growing algorithm is employed. For an improved workflow all algorithms are embedded in a PET/CT therapy monitoring software suite giving the clinician a unified and immediate access to all data sets. Whenever the user clicks on a tumor in a base-line scan, the courses of segmented tumor volumes and SUV measurements are automatically identified and displayed to the user as a graph plot. According to each course, the therapy progress can be classified as complete or partial response or as progressive or stable disease. We have tested our methods with series of PET/CT data from 9 lung cancer patients acquired at Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto. Each patient underwent three PET/CT scans during a radiation therapy. Our results indicate that a combination of mean metabolic activity in the tumor with the PET-based tumor volume can lead to an earlier response detection than a purely volume based (CT diameter) or purely functional based (e.g. SUV max or SUV mean) response measures. The new software seems applicable for easy, faster, and reproducible quantification to routinely monitor tumor therapy.	polyethylene terephthalate	Roland Opfer;Sven Kabus;Torben Schneider;Ingwer C.

48d87cfd0488fa98893ffa6fd21661d8d2051c61	a computational study on effect of a transcranial channel as a skull/brain interface in the conventional rectangular patch-type transcranial direct current stimulation		A conceptual model of a transcranial channel was recently proposed for conveying external currents of the skull to the brain; the effects of the transcranial channel combined with high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) was investigated, resulting in discovery of increased stimulus intensity and focality. In this work, rather than HD-tDCS using smaller disc-type electrodes, we proposed the use of the transcranial channel with conventional tDCS using larger patch electrodes. We used multi-scale computational models that couple an anatomically realistic head model with multi-compartmental models of cortical neurons. We then predicted the excitability in the hand knob (target area) based on stimulus-induced electric fields and steady-state membrane polarizations. Conventional tDCS without the transcranial channel resulted in diffuse distributions of electric fields that covered the frontal cortex, while the spatial focality and intensity of the excitability increased significantly at the target area in the presence of the transcranial channel. Thus, it is expected that conventional tDCS with the transcranial channel allows a better targeting neuromodulation with higher intensity and may be promising for applying prolonged and stabilized tDCS.	application program interface;brain–computer interface;computation;computational model;control knob;electroconvulsive therapy;excited state;hdmi;knob device component;large;multi-compartment model;neuromodulation (medicine);numerous;small;steady state;tissue membrane;transcranial direct current stimulation;transcranial magnetic stimulation;cellular targeting;electric field;electrode;frontal lobe	Hyeon Seo;Hyoung-Ihl Kim;Sung Chan Jun	2017	2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037230	computer vision;artificial intelligence;computer science;electronic engineering;transcranial direct-current stimulation;transcranial alternating current stimulation;communication channel	Visualization	25.753887464879668	-84.18897151809735	61201

For any class of biomedical images, a problem confronting the researcher in image indexing is developing robust algorithms for localizing and identifying anatomy relevant for that image class and relevant to the indexing goals. This problem is particularly acute in the case of digitized spine x-rays, due to the projective nature of the data, which results in overlapping boundaries with possibly ambiguous interpretations; the highly irregular shapes of the vertebral bodies, sometimes additionally distorted by pathology; and possible occlusions of the vertebral anatomy due to subject positioning. We present algorithms that we have developed for the localization and identification of vertebral structure and show how these algorithms fit into the family of algorithms that we continue to develop for our general indexing problem. We also review the indexing goals for this particular collection of digitized spine x-rays and discuss the use of the indexed images in a content-based image retrieval system.	algorithm;content-based image retrieval;dendritic spine;high- and low-level;image analysis;netware loadable module;online and offline;prototype;query by example;radiography	L.

A major impediment preventing its utilization in routine clinical practice is the presence of image """"blooming"""" artifacts due to vascular calcium. For high-risk patients with serious coronary stenosis who often have significant calcified plaque, this problem becomes very acute. In this paper, we examine an approach to ameliorate the degradations due to the presence of calcium and thus increase the applicability of MDCT. We assume the blooming effect is well modeled as a linear convolutional blur. We then use this model as the basis to perform image restoration, thus deblurring the original image. The aim is to produce CT images with reduced calcium artifacts. We evaluate our method on simulated, ex vivo and clinical data and show that this method has the potential to improve coronary CT image and thus improve stenosis diagnosis."""	circuit restoration;deblurring;gaussian blur;image restoration;modified discrete cosine transform;tomography;video-in video-out	Zhuangli Liang;W.

This study investigates the feasibility and accuracy of using an electromagnetically tracked flexible needle inserted into the liver to track liver motion and deformation. This proof-of-principle study was conducted both ex vivo and in vivo with a CT scanner taking the place of an electromagnetic tracking system as the spatial tracker. Deformations of excised livers were artificially created by altering the shape of the stage on which the excised livers rested. Free breathing or controlled ventilation created deformations of live swine livers. The positions of the needle and test targets were determined through CT scans. The shape of the needle was reconstructed using data simulating multiple embedded electromagnetic sensors. Displacement of liver tissues in the vicinity of the needle was derived from the change in the reconstructed shape of the needle. The needle shape was successfully reconstructed with tracking information of two on-needle points. Within 30 mm of the needle, the registration error of implanted test targets was 2.4 ± 1.0 mm ex vivo and 2.8 ± 1.5 mm in vivo. A practical approach was developed to measure the motion and deformation of the liver in real time within a region of interest. The approach relies on redesigning the often-used seeker needle to include embedded electromagnetic tracking sensors. With the nonrigid motion and deformation information of the tracked needle, a single- or multimodality 3D image of the intraprocedural liver, now clinically obtained with some delay, can be updated continuously to monitor intraprocedural changes in hepatic anatomy. This capability may be useful in radiofrequency ablation and other percutaneous ablative procedures.	anatomic structures;ct scan;clinical act of insertion;displacement mapping;embedded system;embedding;guidance system;implants;liver parenchyma;multimodal imaging;musculoskeletal diseases;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;region of interest;respiration;rest;scanning systems;simulation;tracking system;video-in video-out;liver mass;radiofrequency ablation;sensor (device)	Peng Lei;Fred Moeslein;Bradford J.

20d49c3c10bcfe477ae9db88c76e26ead6ad9771	evaluation of automated techniques for the quantification of grey matter atrophy in patients with multiple sclerosis	grey matter;reference standard;multiple sclerosis	Several methods exist and are frequently used to quantify grey matter (GM) atrophy in multiple sclerosis (MS). Fundamental to all available techniques is the accurate segmentation of GM in the brain, a difficult task confounded even further by the pathology present in the brains of MS patients. In this paper, we examine the segmentations of six different automated techniques and compare them to a manually defined reference standard. Results demonstrate that, although the algorithms perform similarly to manual segmentations of cortical GM, severe shortcomings are present in the segmentation of deep GM structures. This deficiency is particularly relevant given the current interest in the role of GM in MS and the numerous reports of atrophy in deep GM structures.	angular defect;atrophic;brain;gray matter;juvenile spinal muscular atrophy;multiple sclerosis;norm (social);patients;quantitation;reference standards;sensitivity and specificity;weakness;algorithm;biologic segmentation	Mishkin Derakhshan;Zografos Caramanos;Paul S.

495ad64b6b8d973d7903d73c95ff58cf5a93e1ca	segmentation and determination of joint space width in foot radiographs	databases;image segmentation;rheumatology;bone;image analysis	Joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis is frequently assessed using radiographs of hands and feet. Evaluation includes measurements of the joint space width (JSW) and detection of erosions. Current visual scoring methods are timeconsuming and subject to inter- and intra-observer variability. Automated measurement methods avoid these limitations and have been fairly successful in hand radiographs. This contribution aims at foot radiographs. Starting from an earlier proposed automated segmentation method we have developed a novel model based image analysis algorithm for JSW measurements. This method uses active appearance and active shape models to identify individual bones. The model compiles ten submodels, each representing a specific bone of the foot (metatarsals 1-5, proximal phalanges 1-5). We have performed segmentation experiments using 24 foot radiographs, randomly selected from a large database from the rheumatology department of a local hospital: 10 for training and 14 for testing. Segmentation was considered successful if the joint locations are correctly determined. Segmentation was successful in only 14%. To improve results a step-by-step analysis will be performed. We performed JSW measurements on 14 randomly selected radiographs. JSW was successfully measured in 75%, mean and standard deviation are 2.30±0.36mm. This is a first step towards automated determination of progression of RA and therapy response in feet using radiographs. © (2016) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

6ff9665d701011d7d0e8677f0efd484b3d47ccc0	mri-trus image synthesis with application to image-guided prostate intervention		Accurate and robust fusion of pre-procedure magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to intra-procedure trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) imaging is necessary for image-guided prostate cancer biopsy procedures. The current clinical standard for image fusion relies on non-rigid surface-based registration between semi-automatically segmented prostate surfaces in both the MRI and TRUS. This surface-based registration method does not take advantage of internal anatomical prostate structures, which have the potential to provide useful information for image registration. However, non-rigid, multi-modal intensity-based MRI-TRUS registration is challenging due to highly non-linear intensities relationships between MRI and TRUS. In this paper, we present preliminary work using image synthesis to cast this problem into a mono-modal registration task by using a large database of over 100 clinical MRI-TRUS image pairs to learn a joint model of MR-TRUS appearance. Thus, given an MRI, we use this learned joint appearance model to synthesize the patient’s corresponding TRUS image appearance with which we could potentially perform mono-modal intensity-based registration. We present preliminary results of this approach.		John A. Onofrey;Ilkay Öksüz;Saradwata Sarkar;Rajesh Venkataraman;Lawrence H.

As the robotic catheter navigates inside the anatomy, its kinematics provide a rough estimate of change in pose. At the same  time, an ICE catheter inserted through the robotic catheter’s lumen acquires images to refine this estimate.    Our algorithm is based on the Unscented Particle Filter (UPF) for stochastic state estimation. We iteratively determine the  catheter’s pose by comparing newly acquired ICE images to segmented Computed Tomography (CT) images of the left atrium. After  considering less than fifteen second’s worth of ICE data, the algorithm converges to an accurate pose estimate despite significant  deviations from the kinematic model, and unmodeled movements in the anatomy.      	algorithm	Aditya B.

We investigated whether a single parametric kinematic model can represent all thumbs, or whether different kinematic model structures are needed to represent different thumbs. We used Monte Carlo simulations to convert the anatomical variability in the kinematic model parameters into distributions of Denavit-Hartenberg parameters amenable for robotics-based models. Upon convergence (3550 simulations, where mean and coefficient of variance changed <1% for the last 20+% simulations) the distributions of Denavit-Hartenberg parameters appeared multimodal, in contrast to the reported unimodal distributions of the anatomy-based parameters. Cluster analysis and one-way analysis of variance confirmed four types of kinematic models (p<0.0001) differentiated primarily by the biomechanically relevant order of MCP joint axes (in 65.2% of models, the flexion-extension axis was distal to the adduction-abduction axis); and secondarily by a detail specifying the direction of a common normal between successive axes of rotation. Importantly, this stochastic analysis of anatomical variability redefines the debate on whether a single generic biomechanical model can represent the entire population, or if subject-specific models are necessary. We suggest a practical third alternative: that anatomical and functional variability can be captured by a finite set of model-types.	anatomic structures;apache axis;axis vertebra;cluster analysis;coefficient;common normal (robotics);convergence (action);definition;denavit–hartenberg parameters;leucaena pulverulenta;monte carlo method;multimodal interaction;one-way function;optic axis of a crystal;orthopedics;robotics;sample variance;simulation;spatial variability;thumb structure;nervous system disorder	Veronica J.

Expert segmentation of 3D patient data sets can last from several hours to days. In this paper we introduce a direct haptic volume rendering approach for lumbar punctures. Preparation time spent for segmentation is much shorter and compared to our reference system nearly identical force output at the needle tip can be observed. The number of structures to be completely segmented by an expert is reduced from 11 to 3 tissues in abdominal data sets with 300 slices.	body tissue;haptic device component;haptic technology;lumbar anterior root stimulator;puncture wound;simulation;spinal puncture;volume rendering;biologic segmentation	André Mastmeyer;Dirk Fortmeier;Heinz Handels	2012	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-022-2-280	computer vision;data mining;volume rendering;haptic technology;artificial intelligence;lumbar puncture;surgery;medicine	Visualization	39.25609332254589	-83.49206631989694	62160

Exclusion criteria: AD, NPH, tumor, and alcohol abuse. Protocol: conventional clinical acquisition (Toshiba; helical, 120 kVp, X-ray tube current 300mA, slice thickness 3-5mm). Locally developed, automatic algorithm was used to segment intracranial cavity (ICC) using (a) white matter seed (b) constrained growth, limited by inner skull layer and (c) topological connectivity. ICC was further segmented into CSF and brain parenchyma using a threshold of 16 Hu. Results: Age distribution: 25–95yrs; (Mean 67±17.5yrs.). Significant correlation was found between age and CSF/ICC(r=0.695, p<0.01 2-tailed). A quadratic model (y=0.06–0.001x+2.56x10-5x2 ; where y=CSF/ICC and x=age) was a better fit to data (r=0.716, p < 0.01). This is in agreement with MRI literature. For example, Smith et al. found annual CSF/ICC increase in 58 – 94.5 y.o. individuals to be 0.2%/year, whereas our data, restricted to the same age group yield 0.3%/year(0.2–0.4%/yrs. 95%C.I.). Slightly increased atrophy among elderly VA patients is attributable to the presence of other comorbidities. Conclusion: Brain atrophy can be reliably calculated using automated software and conventional CT. Compared to MRI, CT is more widely available, cheaper, and less affected by head motion due to ~100 times shorter scan time. Work is in progress to improve the precision of the measurements, possibly leading to assessment of longitudinal changes within the patient. © (2015) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

Even though T1 mapping has a broad range of potential applications, it is not routinely used in clinical practice. The long acquisition time of the required set of high resolution T1-weighted images, needed to obtain a precise high resolution T1 map, is clinically infeasible. To improve the trade-off between the acquisition time, SNR and spatial resolution, we propose to combine super-resolution reconstruction with T1 parameter estimation into one integrated method that estimates a high resolution T1 map directly from a set of low resolution T1-weighted images.	estimation theory;image resolution;linear programming relaxation;resonance;signal-to-noise ratio;super-resolution imaging	Gwendolyn Van Steenkiste;Dirk H.

1a057f437255a6ce32a73c7b924917cb3959dda0	video and accelerometer-based motion analysis for automated surgical skills assessment	surgical skills assessment;computer vision;machine learning;multi-modal data	Basic surgical skills of suturing and knot tying are an essential part of medical training. Having an automated system for surgical skills assessment could help save experts time and improve training efficiency. There have been some recent attempts at automated surgical skills assessment using either video analysis or acceleration data. In this paper, we present a novel approach for automated assessment of OSATS-like surgical skills and provide an analysis of different features on multi-modal data (video and accelerometer data). We conduct a large study for basic surgical skill assessment on a dataset that contained video and accelerometer data for suturing and knot-tying tasks. We introduce “entropy-based” features—approximate entropy and cross-approximate entropy, which quantify the amount of predictability and regularity of fluctuations in time series data. The proposed features are compared to existing methods of Sequential Motion Texture, Discrete Cosine Transform and Discrete Fourier Transform, for surgical skills assessment. We report average performance of different features across all applicable OSATS-like criteria for suturing and knot-tying tasks. Our analysis shows that the proposed entropy-based features outperform previous state-of-the-art methods using video data, achieving average classification accuracies of 95.1 and 92.2% for suturing and knot tying, respectively. For accelerometer data, our method performs better for suturing achieving 86.8% average accuracy. We also show that fusion of video and acceleration features can improve overall performance for skill assessment. Automated surgical skills assessment can be achieved with high accuracy using the proposed entropy features. Such a system can significantly improve the efficiency of surgical training in medical schools and teaching hospitals.	apex1 protein, human;amendment;approximate entropy;approximation algorithm;best, worst and average case;call of duty: black ops;closure by suture;consent forms;contain (action);declaration (computer programming);discrete fourier transform;discrete cosine transform;dyskinesia, drug-induced;eighty;entropy (information theory);eyelid capillary hemangioma;fo (complexity);fifty nine;financial times;helsinki declaration;lu decomposition;lithium;modal logic;numerous;refractory anemias;rheumatoid arthritis;school;schools, medical;seventy nine;silo (dataset);silver;sixty nine;static random-access memory;surgical sutures;ti-nspire series;teaching hospitals;tellurium;time series;trial inclusion and exclusion criteria submission domain;ut-vpn;video content analysis;accelerometers;efmoroctocog alfa 1 unt injection;standards characteristics	Aneeq Zia;Yachna Sharma;Vinay Bettadapura;Eric L.

However, there is currently no effective imaging tool available that is able to access the blood flow within the intact cochlea. In this paper, we report the use of an ultrahigh sensitive optical micro-angiography (UHS-OMAG) imaging system to image 3-D microvascular perfusion within the intact cochlea in living mice. The UHS-OMAG image system used in this study is based on spectral domain optical coherence tomography, which uses a broadband light source centered at 1300 nm with an imaging rate of 47\thinspace 000 A-scans/s, capable of acquiring high-resolution B scans at 300 frames/s. The technique is sensitive enough to image very slow blood flow velocities, such as those found in capillary networks. The 3-D imaging acquisition time for a whole cochlea is ~ 4.1 s. We demonstrate that volumetric reconstruction of microvascular flow obtained by UHS-OMAG provides a comprehensive perfusion map of several regions of the cochlea, including the otic capsule, the stria vascularis of the apical and middle turns and the radiating arterioles that emanate from the modiolus.	blood coagulation disorders;blood capillaries;cochlear implant;cochlear structure;frame (physical object);image resolution;imaging device;krtap5-4 protein, mouse;labyrinth;otic dosage form;preclinical imaging;secure digital;stria vascularis;structure of arteriole;uncombable hair syndrome;video-in video-out;angiogram;tomography	Hrebesh M.

The FH model revealed that the constant activation of potassium channels at the node under the block electrode, rather than inactivation of sodium channels, is the likely mechanism underlying conduction block of myelinated axons induced by high-frequency biphasic stimulation. However, the CRRSS model revealed a different blocking mechanism where the complete inactivation of sodium channels at the nodes next to the block electrode caused the nerve conduction block. The stimulation frequencies to observe conduction block in FH model agree with the observations from animal experiments (greater than 6 kHz), but much higher frequencies are required in CRRSS model (greater than 15 kHz). This frequency difference indicated that the constant activation of potassium channels might be the underlying mechanism of conduction block observed in animal experiments. Using the FH model, this study also showed that the axons could recover from conduction block within 1 ms after termination of the blocking stimulation, which also agrees very well with the animal experiments where nerve block could be reversed immediately once the blocking stimulation was removed. This simulation study, which revealed two possible mechanisms of nerve conduction block in myelinated axons induced by high-frequency biphasic stimulation, can guide future animal experiments as well as optimize stimulation waveforms for electrical nerve block in clinical applications	anatomic node;atrioventricular block;axon;blocking (computing);experiment;heart block;hodgkin–huxley model;huxley's layer of inner root sheath of hair follicle;huxley: the dystopia;kilohertz;lumped element model;myelin sheath;nerve block;nerve conduction function;potassium channel;simulation;sodium channel;transcranial magnetic stimulation	Xu Zhang;James R.

Herein, we employed an intensified CCD system installed in a commercial small animal CT (Computed Tomography) scanner to compare image reconstructions from time-independent, continuous wave (CW) measurements and from time-dependent, frequency domain (FD) measurements in a series of physical phantoms specifically designed for evaluation. Comparisons were performed as a function of 1) number of projections, 2) the level of preprocessing filters used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), 3) endogenous heterogeneity of optical properties, as well as in the cases of 4) two fluorescent targets and 5) a mouse-shaped phantom. Assessment of quantitative recovery of fluorescence absorption cross section was performed using a fully parallel, regularization-free, linear reconstruction algorithm with diffusion approximation (DA) and high order simplified spherical harmonics ( SPN) approximation to the radiative transport equation (RTE). The results show that while FD measurements may result in superior image reconstructions over CW measurements, data acquisition times are significantly longer, necessitating further development of multiple detector/source configurations, improved data read-out rates, and detector technology. FD measurements with SP3 reconstructions enabled better quantitative recovery of fluorescent target strength, but required increased computational expense. Despite the developed parallel reconstruction framework being able to achieve more than 60 times speed increase over sequential implementation, further development in faster parallel acceleration strategies for near-real time and real-time image recovery and more precise forward solution is necessary.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;approximation;ct scan;capability maturity model;charge-coupled device;computation;cross section (geometry);data acquisition;detectors;diffusion magnetic resonance imaging;fluorescence;greater than;hardware acceleration;hearing loss, high-frequency;instrumentation (attribute);morphologic artifacts;performance evaluation;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;preclinical imaging;preprocessor;projections and predictions;real-time clock;recent thymic emigrant;scanning systems;signal-to-noise ratio;spherical power:invlen:pt:eye.left:qn;substitution-permutation network;tomography, emission-computed;x-ray computed tomography	Yujie Lu;Chinmay D.

It is meant to be used as pre-processing step in the computer-assisted detection (CAD) system for malignant lung nodule detection that is being developed by the Medical Applications in a Grid Infrastructure Connection (MAGIC-5) Project. In this new approach the segmentation of the external airways (trachea and bronchi), is obtained by 3D region growing with wavefront simulation and suitable stop conditions, thus allowing an accurate handling of the hilar region, notoriously difficult to be segmented. Particular attention was also devoted to checking and solving the problem of the apparent ‘fusion’ between the lungs, caused by partial-volume effects, while 3D morphology operations ensure the accurate inclusion of all the nodules (internal, pleural, and vascular) in the segmented volume. The new algorithm was initially developed and tested on a dataset of 130 CT scans from the Italung-CT trial, and was then applied to the ANODE09-competition images (55 scans) and to the LIDC database (84 scans), giving very satisfactory results. In particular, the lung contour was adequately located in 96% of the CT scans, with incorrect segmentation of the external airways in the remaining cases. Segmentation metrics were calculated that quantitatively express the consistency between automatic and manual segmentations: the mean overlap degree of the segmentation masks is 0.96 ± 0.02, and the mean and the maximum distance between the mask borders (averaged on the whole dataset) are 0.74 ± 0.05 and 4.5 ± 1.5, respectively, which confirms that the automatic segmentations quite correctly reproduce the borders traced by the radiologist. Moreover, no tissue containing internal and pleural nodules was removed in the segmentation process, so that this method proved to be fit for the use in the framework of a CAD system. Finally, in the comparison with a two-dimensional segmentation procedure, inter-slice smoothness was calculated, showing that the masks created by the 3D algorithm are significantly smoother than those calculated by the 2D-only procedure.	3d computer graphics;bronchi;ct scan;checking (action);closing (morphology);computer-aided design;ground truth;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;handling (psychology);high-resolution computed tomography;image resolution;masks;mathematical morphology;nodule;part dosing unit;plain chest x-ray;pleura;preprocessor;radiology;region growing;scanning;search algorithm;segmentation action;silo (dataset);simulation;structure of parenchyma of lung;thresholding (image processing);trachea;visual inspection;x-ray computed tomography;algorithm;biologic segmentation	Giorgio De Nunzio;Eleonora Tommasi;Antonella Agrusti;Rosella Cataldo;Ivan De Mitri;Marco Favetta;Silvio Maglio;Andrea Massafra;Maurizio Quarta;Massimo Torsello;Ilaria Zecca;Roberto Bellotti;Sabina Sonia Tangaro;Piero Calvini;Niccolò Camarlinghi;Fabio Falaschi;Piergiorgio Cerello;Piernicola Oliva	2009	Journal of Digital Imaging	10.1007/s10278-009-9229-1	stereoscopy;three-dimensional space;computer vision;radiology;medicine;pathology;computer science;retrospective cohort study;cad;region growing;image segmentation;computed tomography;grid;partial volume	Vision	39.897531969082785	-80.38078329082468	62515

The challenge is to insert the needle in the mid-sagittal plane and to avoid overshooting the needle into the spinal cord. Prepuncture 2D ultrasound scanning has been introduced as a reliable tool to localize the target and facilitate epidural needle placement. Ideally, real-time ultrasound should be used during needle insertion. However, several issues inhibit the use of standard 2D ultrasound, including the obstruction of the puncture site by the ultrasound probe, low visibility of the target in ultrasound images, and increased pain due to longer needle trajectory. An alternative is to use 3D ultrasound imaging, where the needle and target could be visible within the same reslice of a 3D volume; however, novice ultrasound users (i.e., many anesthesiologists) still have difficulty interpreting ultrasound images of the spine and identifying the target epidural space. In this paper, we propose to augment 3D ultrasound images by registering a multi-vertebrae statistical shape+pose model. We use such augmentation for enhanced interpretation of the ultrasound and identification of the mid-sagittal plane for the needle insertion. Validation is performed on synthetic data derived from the CT images, and 64 in vivo ultrasound volumes.	ct scan;medical ultrasound;real-time clock;robertson–seymour theorem;synthetic data;video-in video-out	Abtin Rasoulian;Robert Rohling;Purang Abolmaesumi	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-38568-1_6	radiology;medicine;pathology;surgery	Vision	41.03270328970477	-83.05843620673494	62591
c6ab8301911b441e0ee21a2e267495cbb946120c	deformable registration-based super-resolution for isotropic reconstruction of 4-d mri volumes	super resolution deformable registration lung mri magnetic resonance imaging spatial resolution;image reconstruction magnetic resonance imaging mathematical model spatial resolution lungs deformable models	Multi-plane super-resolution (SR) has been widely employed for resolution improvement of MR images. However, this has mostly been limited to MRI acquisitions with rigid motion. In cases of non-rigid motion, volumes are usually pre-registered using deformable registration methods before SR reconstruction. The pre-registered images are then used as input for the SR reconstruction. Since deformable registration involves smoothening of the inputs, using pre-registered inputs could lead to loss in information in SR reconstructions. Additionally, any registration errors present in pre-registered inputs could propagate throughout SR reconstructions leading to error accumulation. To address these limitations, in this study, we propose a deformable registration-based super-resolution reconstruction (DIRSR) reconstruction, which handles deformable registration as part of super-resolution. This approach has been demonstrated using 12 synthetic 4-D MRI lung datasets created using single plane (coronal) datasets of six patients and multi-plane (coronal and axial) 4-D lung MRI dataset of one patient. From our evaluation, DIRSR reconstructions are sharper and well aligned compared to reconstructions using SR of pre-registered inputs and rigid-registration SR. MSE, SNR and SSIM evaluations also indicate better reconstruction quality from DIRSR compared to reconstructions from SR of pre-registered inputs (p-value less than 0.0001). In conclusion, we found superior isotropic reconstructions of 4-D MR datasets from DIRSR reconstructions, which could benefit volumetric MR analyses.	alignment;evaluation;image resolution;muscle rigidity;numerous;p-value;patients;signal-to-noise ratio;silo (dataset);structural similarity;super-resolution imaging;synthetic data;tree accumulation;physiologic resolution;registration - actclass	Geetha Soujanya V.

Eight patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer were imaged with an automated dual-energy CE-DBT system. High energy/low energy image pairs of the index breast were obtained at 1 pre- and 3 post-contrast timepoints. Post-contrast images were obtained after intravenous administration of Visipaque (1 mL/kg). Anatomic images were reconstructed using filtered backprojection, and contrast-enhanced images were generated using simple backprojection followed by temporal or dual-energy subtraction. Dual-energy CE-DBT was able to demonstrate the index malignant lesion in 7 of 8 patients (9 of 10 lesions). Morphologic characteristics including margin detail and associated microcalcifications were qualitatively concordant with DM. Vascular characteristics were identifiable qualitatively on post-processed images in some cases, and judged to be qualitative concordant with breast MRI.	tomosynthesis	Sara Gavenonis;Kristen Lau;Roshan Karunamuni;Yiheng Zhang;Baorui Ren;Chris Ruth;Andrew D.

A Generalized auto-calibrating partially parallel acquisition (GRAPPA) based reconstruction technique using modified robust data fitting was developed. The MR data was acquired with an eight channel phased array receiver on three normal volunteers on a General Electric 3 Tesla scanner. Microstructures comprising the trabecular bone architecture are of the order of 100 microns and hence their depiction requires very high imaging resolution. This work examined the effects of GRAPPA based parallel imaging on signal and noise characteristics and effective spatial resolution in high resolution (HR) images, for the range of undersampling or reduction factors 2-4. Additionally quantitative analysis was performed to obtain structural measures of trabecular bone from the images. Image quality in terms of contrast and depiction of structures was maintained in parallel images for reduction factors up to 3. Comparison between regular and parallel images suggested similar spatial resolution for both. However differences in noise characteristics in parallel images compared to regular images affected the threshholding based quantification. This suggested that GRAPPA based parallel images might require different analysis techniques. In conclusion, the study showed the feasibility of using parallel imaging techniques in HR-MRI of trabecular bone, although quantification strategies will have to be further investigated. Reduction of acquisition time using parallel techniques can improve the clinical feasibility of MRI of trabecular bone for prognosis and staging of the skeletal disorder osteoporosis.© (2006) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

be75f1e88c2846806fcfb8cba085e7821a7a4b60	comparison of two different measurement methods in evaluating basilar atherosclerotic plaque using high-resolution mri at 3 tesla	atherosclerosis;basilar artery;magnetic resonance imaging	BACKGROUND To compare the Self-referenced and Referenced measurement methods in assessing basilar artery (BA) atherosclerotic plaque employing dark blood high-resolution MRI at 3 Tesla.   METHODS Forty patients with > 20% stenosis as identified by conventional MRA were recruited and evaluated on a 3 Tesla MRI system. The outer wall, inner wall and lumen areas of maximal lumen narrowing site and the outer wall and lumen areas of sites that were proximal and distal to the maximal lumen narrowing site were manually traced. Plaque area (PA), stenosis rate (SR) and percent plaque burden (PPB) were calculated using the Self-referenced and Referenced measurement methods, respectively. To assess intra-observer reproducibility, BA plaque was measured twice with a 2-week interval in between measurements.   RESULTS Thirty-seven patients were included in the final analysis. There were no significant differences in PA, SR and PPB measurements between the two methods. The intra-class coefficients and coefficient of variations (CV) ranged from 0.976 to 0.990 and from 3.73 to 5.61% for the Self-referenced method and ranged from 0.928 to 0.971 and from 4.64 to 9.95% for the Referenced method, respectively. Both methods are effective in the evaluation of BA plaque. However, the CVs of the Self-referenced method is lower than the Referenced measurement method. Moreover, Bland-Altman plots showed that the Self-referenced method has a narrower interval than the Referenced measurement method.   CONCLUSIONS The Self-referenced method is better and more convenient for evaluating BA plaque, and it may serve as a promising method for evaluation of basilar atherosclerotic plaque.

To achieve the required registration accuracy of approximately 1mm, the spine is treated as a collection of rigid vertebrae, and a separate rigid body transformation applied to each (Hawkes). This in turn requires segmentation of the CT datasets into separate vertebral images, which is difficult because the narrow planes separating adjacent vertebrae are parallel to the axial plane of the CT scans. We solve this problem by evolving all the vertebral contours simultaneously using a level set method, and use contour competition to estimate the position of the vertebral edges when a clean separation between adjacent vertebrae is not seen. Contour competition is based in turn on the vertical scan principle: no part of a given vertebra is vertically below any part of an inferior vertebra. Once segmentation is complete, the individual rigid body transforms are then estimated using mutual information maximization, and the CT images of the vertebrae superimposed on the MR scans. The resultant fused images contain the bony detail of CT and the soft tissue discrimination of MR and appear to be diagnostically equivalent, or superior, to CT myelograms. A formal test of these conclusions is planned for the next phase of our work.© (2004) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

991e4d9749a9001c11592f81097e8f0f71ce8c80	automatic detection of surgical haemorrhage using computer vision	computer vision;laparoscopic surgery;massive bleeding	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES On occasions, a surgical intervention can be associated with serious, potentially life-threatening complications. One of these complications is a haemorrhage during the operation, an unsolved issue that could delay the intervention or even cause the patient's death. On laparoscopic surgery this complication is even more dangerous, due to the limited vision and mobility imposed by the minimally invasive techniques.   METHODS In this paper it is described a computer vision algorithm designed to analyse the images captured by a laparoscopic camera, classifying the pixels of each frame in blood pixels and background pixels and finally detecting a massive haemorrhage. The pixel classification is carried out by comparing the parameter B/R and G/R of the RGB space colour of each pixel with a threshold obtained using the global average of the whole frame of these parameters. The detection of and starting haemorrhage is achieved by analysing the variation of the previous parameters and the amount of pixel blood classified.   RESULTS When classifying in vitro images, the proposed algorithm obtains accuracy over 96%, but during the analysis of an in vivo images obtained from real operations, the results worsen slightly due to poor illumination, visual interferences or sudden moves of the camera, obtaining accuracy over 88%. The detection of haemorrhages directly depends of the correct classification of blood pixels, so the analysis achieves an accuracy of 78%.   CONCLUSIONS The proposed algorithm turns out to be a good starting point for an automatic detection of blood and bleeding in the surgical environment which can be applied to enhance the surgeon vision, for example showing the last frame previous to a massive haemorrhage where the incision could be seen using augmented reality capabilities.	area striata structure;augmented reality;cessation of life;classification;computer vision;cranial incision point;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;hemorrhage;in vitro [publication type];patients;pixel;population parameter;sensor;surgical procedures, laparoscopic;video-in video-out;algorithm	Álvaro García-Martínez;Jose María Vicente-Samper;José María Sabater	2017	Artificial intelligence in medicine	10.1016/j.artmed.2017.06.002	pixel;laparoscopic surgery;computer science;massive bleeding;augmented reality;rgb color model;massive haemorrhage;computer vision;limited vision;artificial intelligence	Vision	35.41712310517739	-80.65900699961479	63009

Many of these detection methods involve deforming the breast. Often, these deformed images need to be correlated to anatomical images of the breast in a different configuration. In the case of our elastography framework, a series of comparisons between the preand post-deformed images needs to be performed. This paper presents an automatic method for determining correspondence between images of a pendant breast and a partially-constrained, compressed breast. The algorithm is an extension to the symmetric closest point approach of Papademetris et al. However, because of the unique deformation and shape change of a partially-constrained, compressed breast, the algorithm was modified through the use of iterative closest point (ICP) registration on easily identifiable sections of the breast images and through weighting the symmetric nearest neighbor correspondence. The algorithm presented in this paper significantly improves correspondence determination between the preand post-deformed images for a simulation when compared to the original Papademetris et al.’s symmetric closest point criteria.	algorithm;ct scan;characteristic impedance;elastography;iterative closest point;iterative method;mathematical morphology;microwave;simulation;test case;tomography	Daniel R.

Our contribution is the design and implementation of a reconstruction algorithm that incorporates general Lp regularization (p ¿ 1). The originality of this work lies in the application of general Lp constraints to fluorescence tomography, combined with an efficient matrix-free strategy that enables the algorithm to deal with large reconstruction problems at reduced memory and computational costs. In the experimental part, we specialize the application of the algorithm to the case of sparsity promoting constraints (L 1). We validate the adequacy of L 1 regularization for the investigation of phenomena that are well described by a sparse model, using data acquired during phantom experiments.	algorithm;computation;experiment;fluorescence;lipoprotein types--lp system lp(a) hyperlipoproteinemia;matrix regularization;numerical method;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;promotion (action);reconstruction conjecture;sparse matrix;tomography;well-posed problem	Jean-Charles Baritaux;Kai Hassler;Michael Unser	2010	IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging	10.1109/TMI.2010.2042814	mathematical optimization;radiology;numerical analysis;mathematics;tomography;optics;physics;algorithm;molecular biophysics	Vision	51.76796882388715	-80.28292138088143	63140

While both approaches exploit the similarity among the different cardiac gate intervals, they differ in the form of temporal regularization imposed during reconstruction. In this work, we provide a quantitative comparison of these two approaches in terms of reconstruction accuracy of the myocardium using several quantitative measures, including signal-to-noise ratio, time activity curves, and ability for perfusion defect detection. In our experiments, we simulated gated cardiac imaging with the NURBS-based cardiac-torso phantom and Tc99m-Teboroxime as the imaging agent. The results show that both approaches could yield similar overall accuracy in the myocardium, and the B-spline approach could achieve slightly better estimation of the time activities compared to the dynamic EM approach.	computational human phantom;dynamic imaging;experiment;imaging agent;iterative reconstruction;non-uniform rational b-spline;signal-to-noise ratio;software bug	Xiaofeng Niu;Yongyi Yang;Miles N.

To date, examination of this micro- architecture has been limited to two-dimensional imaging techniques. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of the three-dimensional imaging technique; optical projection tomography (OPT), to visualize the collagenous structure of the meniscus. If successful, this technique would be the first to visualize the macroscopic orientation of collagen fascicles in 3-D in the meniscus and could further refine load bearing mechanisms in the tissue. OPT is an imaging technique capable of imaging samples on the meso-scale (1-10 mm) at a micro-scale resolution. The technique, similar to computed tomography, takes two-dimensional images of objects from incremental angles around the object and reconstructs them using a back projection algorithm to determine three-dimensional structure.   METHODS Bovine meniscal samples were imaged from four locations (outer main body, femoral surface, tibial surface and inner main body) to determine the variation in collagen orientation throughout the tissue. Bovine stifles (n = 2) were obtained from a local abattoir and the menisci carefully dissected. Menisci were fixed in methanol and subsequently cut using a custom cutting jig (n = 4 samples per meniscus). Samples were then mounted in agarose, dehydrated in methanol and subsequently cleared using benzyl alcohol benzyl benzoate (BABB) and imaged using OPT.   RESULTS Results indicate circumferential, radial and oblique collagenous orientations at the contact surfaces and in the inner third of the main body of the meniscus. Imaging identified fascicles ranging from 80-420 μm in diameter. Transition zones where fascicles were found to have a woven or braided appearance were also identified. The outer-third of the main body was composed of fascicles oriented predominantly in the circumferential direction. Blood vessels were also visualized using this technique, as their elastin content fluoresces more brightly than collagen at the 425 nm wavelength used by the OPT scanner.   CONCLUSIONS OPT was capable of imaging the collagenous structure, as well as blood vessels in the bovine meniscus. Collagenous structure variability, including transition zones between structural regions not previously described in the meniscus, was identified using this novel technique.	abattoirs;benzoates;benzyl alcohol;blood vessel;bone structure of tibia;bovine metabolome database;ct scan;circumference;complex network;dehydration;diameter (qualifier value);eighty;ethanol 0.62 ml/ml topical gel;fascicle - nerve fibers;herpesvirus 2, bovine;imaging techniques;imaging, three-dimensional;increment;meniscus structure of joint;mesoscopic physics;methanol;oblique projection;physical object;radial (radio);scanning systems;spatial variability;stifle joint;weight-bearing state;x-ray computed tomography;algorithm	Stephen H.

b1de62b4003cc40c75fdd953aa7ca6269f1c5e0a	simulated mammography using synthetic 3d breasts		How can we describe the form of an object as complex as the human breast? When we examine the anatomy of the breast it appears to consist of a highly irregular and chaotic arrangement of tissue. Pathologists and radiologists seek to describe this anatomy at different spatial scales, but they face the common difficulty of reconstructing a three-dimensional form out of two-dimensional views, such as radiographic projections and tissue slices. There has been little research into measuring the anatomy of the breast in three dimensions [6]. In this paper we present an algorithm that simulates the growth of duct systems within a breast volume. A description of image texture based on the Fourier spectrum is used to compare the simulation with real breast pathology. A model of the mammographic imaging process developed at Oxford [3] allows us to simulate the mammograms that would be obtained by subjecting the artificial breast to selected x-ray exposures. We consider that simulation of breast growth and form will have applications in the areas of breast development, physiology, and computer-aided diagnosis of breast cancer.	synthetic intelligence	Paul Taylor;Robyn Owens;David Ingram	1998		10.1007/978-94-011-5318-8_47	breast cancer;radiology;image texture;computer science;mammography;breast development;radiography	Robotics	35.87474960476101	-85.58363062551359	63593
fe94278ae386b286266cf203d6ab539c624b3c7c	parallel imaging acceleration of epik for reduced image distortions in fmri		EPI with Keyhole (EPIK) is a hybrid imaging technique used to improve the performance of EPI in dynamic MRI applications. The method had been previously validated at 1.5 T with both phantom and in vivo images; EPIK was able to provide a higher temporal resolution and less image distortions than single-shot EPI. The data presented here demonstrate that the performance of EPIK can be further improved by accelerating it with the parallel imaging. For this work, this combination was tested at 3 T. After initial evaluation using phantom images, use of the method in functional MRI was verified with visual fMRI measurements as well as MRI simulation results. The results showed that accelerated EPIK had increased temporal resolution with favorable robustness against susceptibility artifacts when compared with EPI or non-accelerated EPIK.	distortion;elegant degradation;image quality;imaging techniques;imaging phantom;imaging, hybrid;morphologic artifacts;numerous;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;sensor;simulation;video-in video-out;fmri	Seong Dae Yun;Martina Reske;Kaveh Vahedipour;Tracy Warbrick;Nadim Joni Shah	2013	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.01.070	computer vision;computer science;nuclear medicine	Vision	45.322443237421155	-82.83342147596521	63816

One alternative is to incorporate additional prior knowledge, e.g., about the spatial topography of selected source sensor projections, into the BSS approach by means of constraints. This letter describes a modified version of the FastICA algorithm for spatially constrained BSS, where the estimates of selected columns of the mixing matrix are constrained with reference to predetermined source sensor projections.	algorithm;blind signal separation;column (database);electroencephalography;fastica;fixed-point iteration;gradient;hoc (programming language);independent computing architecture;magnetoencephalography;signal processing;source separation;source tracking;topography	C.

We have previously described an algorithm that uses the single-equivalent moving dipole model to rapidly identify both the location of cardiac sources from body surface electrocardiographic signals and the location of the ablation catheter tip from current pulses delivered at the tip. However, during catheter ablation, in the presence of sources of systematic error, even if the exit site and catheter tip dipole are superposed in real space, their calculated positions may be separated by as much as 5 mm if their orientations are not exactly matched. In this study, we present a method to compensate for the effect of dipole orientation and examine the method's ability to guide a dipole at a catheter tip to an arrhythmogenic dipole corresponding to the exit site. In computer simulations, we show that the new method enables the user to guide the catheter tip to within 1.5 mm of the arrhythmogenic dipole using a realistic number of movements of the ablation catheter. These results suggest that this method has the potential to greatly facilitate RF ablation procedures, especially in the significant patient population with hemodynamically unstable arrhythmias.	angina, unstable;body surface;cardiac ablation;computer simulation;control theory;hemodynamics;lewy body disease;mental orientation;movement;patients;radio frequency;reentrancy (computing);ventricular arrhythmia;algorithm	Maya E.

Robotic catheter technology could offer benefits such as reduced radiation exposure to the clinician and improved intravascular navigation. Incorporating three-dimensional preoperative imaging into a semiautonomous robotic catheterization platform has the potential for safer and more precise navigation. This paper discusses a semiautonomous robotic catheter platform based on previous work (Rafii-Tari et al., in: MICCAI2013, pp 369–377. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-40763-5_46, 2013) by proposing a method to address anatomical variability among aortic arches. It incorporates anatomical information in the process of catheter trajectories optimization, hence can adapt to the scale and orientation differences among patient-specific anatomies. Statistical modeling is implemented to encode the catheter motions of both proximal and distal sites based on cannulation data obtained from a single phantom by an expert operator. Non-rigid registration is applied to obtain a warping function to map catheter tip trajectories into other anatomically similar but shape/scale/orientation different models. The remapped trajectories were used to generate robot trajectories to conduct a collaborative cannulation task under flow simulations. Cross-validations were performed to test the performance of the non-rigid registration. Success rates of the cannulation task executed by the robotic platform were measured. The quality of the catheterization was also assessed using performance metrics for manual and robotic approaches. Furthermore, the contact forces between the instruments and the phantoms were measured and compared for both approaches. The success rate for semiautomatic cannulation is 98.1% under dry simulation and 94.4% under continuous flow simulation. The proposed robotic approach achieved smoother catheter paths than manual approach. The mean contact forces have been reduced by 33.3% with the robotic approach, and 70.6% less STDEV forces were observed with the robot. This work provides insights into catheter task planning and an improved design of hands-on ergonomic catheter navigation robots.	cannulation;data interpretation, statistical;encode;execution;gastromyxum rafii;hands-on computing;human factors and ergonomics;instrument - device;intraoperative imaging;mathematical optimization;muscle rigidity;navigation;patients;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;robot;science of anatomy;simulation;spatial variability;therapeutic radiology procedure;benefit;registration - actclass	Wenqiang Chi;Jindong Liu;Hedyeh Rafii-Tari;Celia V.

We propose a hexahedron-based finite element method, combined with a posteriori error estimation driven local h-refinement, for simulating soft tissue deformation. This enables to control the local error and global error level in the mechanical fields (e.g. displacement or gradient) during the simulation. The local error level is used to refine the mesh only where it is needed, while maintaining a coarser mesh elsewhere. We investigate the convergence of the algorithm on academic examples, and demonstrate its practical usability on a percutaneous procedure involving needle insertion in a liver. For the latter case, we compare the force displacement curves obtained from the proposed adaptive algorithm with that obtained from a uniform refinement approach.	adaptive algorithm;adaptive mesh refinement;discretization error;displacement mapping;elasticity (data store);finite element method;gradient;hexahedron;real-time clock;real-time transcription;refinement (computing);simulation;usability	Huu Phuoc Bui;Satyendra Tomar;Rémi Bessard-Duparc;Hadrien Courtecuisse;Stephane Cotin;Stéphane P.

One of the clinical difficulties with implanting an ICD is efficacy estimation, estimating the correct capacitor charging voltage. Current techniques require repeated inductions of VF, and yield inaccurate and poorly defined estimates. The authors have optimized these standard efficacy estimators using Bayesian estimation theory, reducing their root-mean-square (RMS) error from 26% to 11%. They are currently developing a completely novel approach. Preliminary simulations suggest that 1 VF induction with the new approach gives efficacy-estimates with RMS errors as low as for 2 VF inductions using standard approaches. >		Robert A. Malkin;Theo C.

This approach does not allow to obtain an accurate reconstruction of the breast shape and asymmetries can easily arise after surgery. Purpose of this work is to present a method which can help the surgeon in the choice of the shape and dimensions of a prosthesis allowing for a perfect symmetry between the prosthesis and the controlateral breast and can be used as a 3D visual feedback in plastic surgery. The breast 3D shape is reconstructed starting from a set of 3D points which are small spots produced by three optical pens (semiconductor lasers, 670nm, 5mW) manually moved over the breast skin. These spots are surveyed by four specially designed CCD cameras and their 2D position on the camera targets is computed at a sub-pixel accuracy (0.1 pixels) through a real-time cross-correlation implemented on a VLSI custom board (ELITE system). These co-ordinates are sent to a host computer which determines and visualises the 3D position of the points in real-time. Starting from these points, a continuous description of the 3D surface is obtained through a linear combination of weighted Gaussian functions (Radial Basis Network). The weights are estimated through a maximum a-posteriori estimate carried out on a local sub-set of the data points. Starting from this continuos reconstruction of the surface in 3D space, it is possible to identify the overall volume as well as the shape of whichever section of the breast, which constitute the information needed by the surgeon to evaluate and adapt the proper implant. Moreover, this allows an easy follow up of the skin expansion after the implantation of the expander in the months next to the surgery. The same 3D scanner can be used to get a virtual 3D model of the actual breast which can be interactively modified with the patient in order to achieve a desired shape with aesthetic plastic surgery. The simplified structure of the system allows to define it as portable and therefore it allows to take measurements easily outside the hospital with very high accuracy. The reconstruction algorithm allows to get 3D reliable data and a compact and easy way to manipulate a virtual model of the breast surface. Such a system can be of extreme help to assist the surgeon before plastic implants and before corrective plastic surgery. Its main advantages on other methods are the flexibility in terms of size of objects that can be scanned and in the absolutely non contact, non constraining data acquisition procedure and the high accuracy that can be attained.	3d modeling;3d scanner;algorithm;charge-coupled device;cross-correlation;data acquisition;data point;host (network);interactivity;ion implantation;pixel;polygonal modeling;radial basis function network;real-time clock;semiconductor;very-large-scale integration	Camilla Rigotti;N.

In this study, we quantitatively assessed image quality of image sequences acquired with and without binning using a clinically relevant task of detecting the tip of a guidewire. Detection was evaluated at two exposures and at two different orientations with respect to the guidewire, without binning and for three binning methods. We evaluated conventional data line (D) and gate line (G) binning and a third novel method in which alternate frames in an image sequence used D and G-binning. While the best conventional binning method depended on orientation and exposure, alternate binning was not significantly (p>0.1) different from the corresponding best conventional method. The results indicate that orientation independent alternate binning can be a desirable replacement for conventional binning methods.		Yogesh Srinivas;David L.

An indentation probe is used to press against breast tissue. Then, the measured reaction force is used to estimate the parameters of nonlinear elasticity, which enables the identification of tissue type, such as fat, muscle, mammary gland or tumor. Here, we present the basic concept of our study and preliminary experimental and simulation results from pilot studies. More specifically, we measured the nonlinear response of reaction force using the breast of a goat. In addition, we also simulated the reaction force using nonlinear biomechanical simulation with several tissue types. Large differences in reaction force occur only in the nonlinear range in both experimental and simulation situations. Our results confirmed the feasibility of our concept.	addresses (publication format);body tissue;breast fibrocystic disease;elasticity (data store);file allocation table;histocompatibility testing;mammary gland parenchyma;muscle;neoplasms;nonlinear system;palpation;platelet glycoprotein 4, human;simulation;software diagnosis	Yo Kobayashi;Mariko Tsukune;Takeharu Hoshi;Tomoyuki Miyashita;Yasuyuki Shiraishi;Tomoyuki Yambe;Masakatsu G.

The estimator iteratively updates a parametric 3D motion model so that the modeled projection views of the deformed reference volume best match the measured projection views. Complicated motion models with many degrees of freedom may better describe the real motion, but the optimizations assiciated with them may overfit noise and may be easily trapped by local minima due to a large number of parameters. For the latter problem, we believe it can be solved by offering the optimization algorithm a good starting point within the valley containing the global minimum point. Therefore, we propose to start the motion estimation with a simplified motion model, in which we assume the displacement of each voxel at any time is proportional to the full movement of that voxel from extreme exhale to extreme inhale. We first obtain the full motion by registering two breathhold CT volumes at end-expiration and end-inspiration. We then estimate a sequence of scalar displacement proportionality parameters. Thus the goal simplifies to finding a motion amplitude signal. This estimation problem can be solved quickly using the exhale reference volume and projection views with coarse (downsampled) resolution, while still providing acceptable estimation accuracy. The estimated simple motion then can be used to initialize a more complicated motion estimator.	algorithm;ct scan;computation;decimation (signal processing);displacement mapping;imaging phantom;iteration;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;motion estimation;overfitting;simulation;time complexity;voxel	Rongping Zeng;Jeffrey A.

With the introduction of compressed sensing (CS) theory, solutions for undersampled data have arisen which reconstruct images consistent with the acquired samples and compliant with a sparsity model in some transform domain. Fixed basis transforms have been extensively used as sparsifying transforms in the past, but recent developments in dictionary learning (DL) have been shown to outperform them by training an overcomplete basis that is optimal for a particular dataset. We present here an iterative algorithm that enables the application of DL for the reconstruction of cardiac cine data with Cartesian undersampling. This is achieved with local processing of spatio-temporal 3D patches and by independent treatment of the real and imaginary parts of the dataset. The enforcement of temporal gradients is also proposed as an additional constraint that can greatly accelerate the convergence rate and improve the reconstruction for high acceleration rates. The method is compared to and shown to systematically outperform k- t FOCUSS, a successful CS method that uses a fixed basis transform.	algorithm;aliasing;base;compliance behavior;compressed sensing;computation;convergence (action);data (star trek);dictionary [publication type];discrete cosine transform;entity class - imaging modality;gradient;imaginary time;iterative method;k-svd;kidney diseases;machine learning;modality (human–computer interaction);noise reduction;online and offline;patients;preparation;problem-based learning;rate of convergence;resonance;silo (dataset);singular value decomposition;solutions;sparse matrix;undersampling	Jose Caballero;Anthony N.

65815c92a988726e3757210e9037d1ae0676894c	a computer simulation model for doppler ultrasound signals from pulsatile blood flow in stenosed vessels	pulsatile flow;doppler ultrasound signal;computer simulation model;stenosed vessel	A computer simulation model based on an analytic flow velocity distribution is proposed to generate Doppler ultrasound signals from pulsatile blood flow in the vessels with various stenosis degrees. The model takes into account the velocity field from pulsatile blood flow in the stenosed vessels, sample volume shape and acoustic factors that affect the Doppler signals. By analytically solving the Navier-Stokes equations, the velocity distributions of pulsatile blood flow in the vessels with various stenosis degrees are firstly calculated according to the velocity at the axis of the circular tube. Secondly, power spectral density (PSD) of the Doppler signals is estimated by summing the contribution of all scatterers passing through the sample volume grouped into elemental volumes. Finally, Doppler signals are generated using cosine-superposed components that are modulated by the PSD functions that vary over the cardiac cycle. The results show that the model generates Doppler blood flow signals with characteristics similar to those found in practice. It could be concluded that the proposed approach offers the advantages of computational simplicity and practicality for simulating Doppler ultrasound signals from pulsatile blood flow in stenosed vessels.

The intensity inhomogeneity (IIH) is modeled by a multiplicative inhomogeneity field. It is due to the spatial inhomogeneity in the excitatory Radio Frequency (RF) signal and other effects. It has been acknowledged as a greater source of error for automatic segmentation algorithms than additive noise. We propose a new non parametric IIH correction algorithm where the Self Organizing Map (SOM) is used to estimate the IIH field.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;radio frequency;resonance;utility functions on indivisible goods	Maite García-Sebastián;Manuel Graña	2007			piecewise;artificial intelligence;resonance;radio frequency;multiplicative function;nonparametric statistics;pattern recognition;computer vision;computer science;image resolution	Vision	48.22086788833911	-83.251455070148	65861

There exist well established and applicable methods such as Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) and Curved Planar Reformation (CPR). However, when calcified vessel walls are investigated, occlusion hinders exploration of the vessel interior with MIP. In contrast, CPR offers the possibility to visualize the vessel lumen by cutting a single vessel along its centerline. Extending the idea of CPR, we propose a novel technique, called Centerline Reformation (CR), which is capable of visualizing the lumen of spatially arbitrarily oriented vessels not necessarily connected in a tree structure. In order to visually emphasize depth, overlap and occlusion, halos can optionally envelope the vessel lumen. The required vessel centerlines are obtained from volumetric data by performing a scale-space based feature extraction. We present the application of the proposed technique in a focus and context setup. Further, we demonstrate how it facilitates the investigation of dense vascular structures, particularly cervical vessels or vessel data featuring peripheral arterial occlusive diseases or pulmonary embolisms. Finally, feedback from domain experts is given.	computed tomography angiography;discretization;feature extraction;feedback;franz lisp;graphics processing unit;interactive visualization;maximum intensity projection;medical imaging;peripheral;post-reformation digital library;scale space;sparse;tree structure	Gabriel Mistelbauer;Andrej Varchola;Hamed Bouzari;Juraj Starinský;Arnold Köchl;Ruediger E Schernthaner;Dominik Fleischmann;Meister Eduard Gröller;Milos Srámek	2012	2012 IEEE Pacific Visualization Symposium	10.1109/PacificVis.2012.6183596	computer vision;engineering;engineering drawing;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	38.03355250640934	-83.9232187750446	65998
77b2ff94058d737396692a32a274c5b72a8c9e8e	motion-corrected, super-resolution reconstruction for high-resolution 3d cardiac cine mri		Cardiac cine MRI with 3D isotropic resolution is challenging as it re- quires efficient data acquisition and motion management. It is proposed to use a 2D balanced SSFP (steady-state free precession) sequence rather than its 3D ver- sion as it provides better contrast between blood and tissue. In order to obtain 3D isotropic images, 2D multi-slice datasets are acquired in different orientations (short axis, horizontal long axis and vertical long axis) while the patient is breath- ing freely. Image reconstruction is performed in two steps: (i) a motion- compensated reconstruction of each image stack corrects for nonrigid cardiac and respiratory motion; (ii) a super-resolution (SR) algorithm combines the three mo- tion-corrected volumes (with low resolution in the slice direction) into a single volume with isotropic resolution. The SR reconstruction was implemented with two regularization schemes including a conventional one (Tikhonov) and a fea- ture-preserving one (Beltrami). The method was validated in 8 volunteers and 10 patients with breathing difficulties. Image sharpness, as assessed by intensity pro- files and by objective metrics based on the structure tensor, was improved with both SR techniques. The Beltrami constraint provided efficient denoising without altering the effective resolution.	super-resolution imaging	Freddy Odille;Aurélien Bustin;Bailiang Chen;Pierre-André Vuissoz;Jacques Felblinger	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-24574-4_52	computer vision;mathematics;geometry	Vision	44.892011975383994	-82.71251868096296	66058

It should be noted that the approach does not attempt to optimize the quality of a pre-defined mathematical representation, the estimator. In contrast, our suggestion aims at obtaining the maximum amount of information without enforcing a particular feature representation. Results for three significantly different average propagator distributions are presented. The results show that the optimal q-space metric has a strong dependence on the assumed distribution in the targeted tissue. In many practical cases educated guesses can be made regarding the average propagator distribution present. In such cases the presented analysis can produce a metric that is optimal with respect to this distribution. The metric will be different at different q-space locations and is defined by the amount of additional information that is obtained when adding a second sample at a given offset from a first sample. The intention is to use the obtained metric as a guide for the generation of specific efficient q-space sample distributions for the targeted tissue.	assumed;educational process of instructing;mathematics;propagator;quantitation;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;united states national institutes of health;funding grant	Hans Knutsson;Carl-Fredrik Westin	2014	Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ...

f488720c3e2a2b2f7dfd2861de28abf664185448	on blood viscosity and its correlation with biological parameters		In recent years interest in blood viscosity has increased significantly in different biomedical areas. Blood viscosity, a measure of the resistance of blood flow, related to its thickness and stickiness, is one of the main biophysical properties of blood. Many factors affect blood viscosity, both in physiological and in pathological conditions. The aim of this study is to estimate blood viscosity by using the regression equation of viscosity which is based on hematocrit and total plasma proteins. It can be used to perform several observations regards the main factors which can influence blood viscosity. The main contribution regards the correlation between viscosity values and other important biological parameters such as cholesterol. This correlation has been supported by performing statistical tests and it suggest that the viscosity could be the main risk factor in cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, it is the only biological measure being correlated with the other cardiovascular risk factors. Results obtained are compliant with values obtained by using the standard viscosity measurement through a viscometer.	cross-sectional data;plasma active;population;thickness (graph theory);verification and validation	Patrizia Vizza;Giuseppe Tradigo;Marianna Parrilla;Pietro Hiram Guzzi;Agostino Gnasso;Pierangelo Veltri	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-93701-4_26	regression analysis;mathematical optimization;viscosity;blood flow;statistics;computer science	ML	27.371909113402243	-84.54119201994634	66289

The scanner uses two pairs of detectors. Each detector consists of 400 small individual yttrium aluminum perovskite (YAP) scintillator crystals of dimensions 2/spl times/2/spl times/15 mm/sup 3/, optically isolated and glued together, which are coupled to position-sensitive photomultiplier tubes (PSPMTs). The detector modules can be moved in a radial direction so that the detector-to-detector spacing can be varied. Special hardware has been built for coincidence detection, position detection, and real-time data acquisition, which is performed by a PC. The single-event data are transferred to workstations where the radioactivity distribution is reconstructed. The dimensions of the crystals and the detector layout are the result of extensive simulations which are described in this report, taking into account sensitivity, spatial resolution and additional parameters like parallax error or scatter effects. For the three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction a genuine 3-D expectation-maximization (EM)-algorithm which can include the characteristics of the detector system has been implemented. The reconstruction software is flexible and matches the different detector configurations. The main advantage of the proposed animal PET scanner is its high flexibility, allowing the realization of various detector-system configurations. By changing the detector-to-detector spacing, the system is capable of either providing good spatial resolution or high sensitivity for dynamic studies of pharmacokinetics.	aluminum hydroxide 40 mg/ml / magnesium hydroxide 40 mg/ml / simethicone 4 mg/ml oral suspension;blast e-value;data acquisition;detectors;dimensions;expectation–maximization algorithm;hereditary angioedema type iii;pet/ct scan;parallax;photomultiplier device component;polyethylene terephthalate;positrons;radial (radio);radioactivity;real-time data;relocation of home or business;scanner device component;scanning systems;simulation;specimen source codes - tube;tomography;video-in video-out;workstation;yttrium	Stefan Weber;Andreas Terstegge;Hans Herzog;R.

a648cc9516d69b50107f7b440c7739deb65ee635	3d model-based documentation with the tumor therapy manager (ttm) improves tnm staging of head and neck tumor patients	patient data;panendoscopy;three dimensional;tumor therapy manager;tnm staging;documentation;head and neck cancer;reproducibility	Many treatment approaches are available for head and neck cancer (HNC), leading to challenges for a multidisciplinary medical team in matching each patient with an appropriate regimen. In this effort, primary diagnostics and its reliable documentation are indispensable. A three-dimensional (3D) documentation system was developed and tested to determine its influence on interpretation of these data, especially for TNM classification. A total of 42 HNC patient data sets were available, including primary diagnostics such as panendoscopy, performed and evaluated by an experienced head and neck surgeon. In addition to the conventional panendoscopy form and report, a 3D representation was generated with the “Tumor Therapy Manager” (TTM) software. These cases were randomly re-evaluated by 11 experienced otolaryngologists from five hospitals, half with and half without the TTM data. The accuracy of tumor staging was assessed by pre–post comparison of the TNM classification. TNM staging showed no significant differences in tumor classification (T) with and without 3D from TTM. However, there was a significant decrease in standard deviation from 0.86 to 0.63 via TTM ( $$p=0.027$$ p = 0.027 ). In nodal staging without TTM, the lymph nodes (N) were significantly underestimated with $$0.39\pm 0.79$$ 0.39 ± 0.79 classes compared with $$0.07\pm 0.69$$ 0.07 ± 0.69 with TTM ( $$p=0.002$$ p = 0.002 ). Likewise, the standard deviation was reduced from 0.79 to 0.69 ( $$p=0.032$$ p = 0.032 ). There was no influence of TTM results on the evaluation of distant metastases (M). TNM staging was more reproducible and nodal staging more accurate when 3D documentation of HNC primary data was available to experienced otolaryngologists. The more precise assessment of the tumor classification with TTM should provide improved decision-making concerning therapy, especially within the interdisciplinary tumor board.	3d modeling;aggregate data;anatomic node;ct scan;cancer of head and neck;decision making;diagnostic neoplasm staging;disk staging;documentation;head and neck neoplasms;head and neck structure;lymph node tissue;mmp8 wt allele;patient data;patients;randomness;sample variance;standard deviation;tnm staging system;the nameless mod;the third manifesto;lymph nodes;panendoscopy;who tumor classification	Thomas Pankau;Gunnar Wichmann;Thomas Neumuth;Bernhard Preim;Andreas Dietz;Patrick Stumpp;Andreas Boehm	2014	International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery	10.1007/s11548-014-1131-8	medicine;pathology;documentation;computer science;reproducibility;surgery;statistics	ML	36.889029744025386	-82.3725119781315	66388

Computer and image-assisted surgery is emerging as a useful surgical tool in terms of improving the accuracy of orthopaedic procedures. This study evaluated the accuracy of implant alignment using an image-based navigation technique compared against a conventional non-navigated approach. Implant alignment error was 0.8 ± 0.3 mm in translation and 1.1 ± 0.4° in rotation for the navigated alignment, compared with 3.1 ± 1.3 mm and 5.0 ± 3.8° for the non-navigated alignment. Five (5) of the 11 non-navigated alignments were malaligned greater than 5° while none of the navigated alignments were placed with an error of greater than 2.0°. It is likely that improved implant positioning will lead to reduced implant loading and wear, resulting in fewer implantrelated complications and revision surgeries.© (2009) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

Two groups of women: gene-mutation carriers and low-risk women were included in this study. Power spectral analysis was performed within parenchymal regions of 172 digitized craniocaudal normal mammograms of the BRCA1/BRCA2 gene-mutation carriers and those of women at low-risk of developing breast cancer. The power law spectrum of the form, P (f )=B /f β was evaluated for the mammographic patterns. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess the performance of exponent β as a decision variable in the task of distinguishing between high and low-risk subjects. Power spectral analysis of mammograms demonstrated that mammographic parenchymal patterns have a power-law spectrum of the form, P (f )=B /f β where f is radial spatial frequency, with the average β values of 2.92 and 2.47 for the gene-mutation carriers and for the low-risk women, respectively. Az values of 0.90 and 0.89 were achieved in distinguishing between the gene-mutation carriers and the low-risk women with the individual image β value as the decision variable in the entire database and the age-matched group, respectively.© (2006) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

5130e565f28cbe7b3d8c8acb19c102afd1bd396c	performance of hull-detection algorithms for proton computed tomography reconstruction		Proton computed tomography (pCT) is an imaging modality developed for patients who are receiving proton radiation therapy. The purpose of this work was to investigate hull-detection algorithms used for preconditioning of the large and sparse linear system of equations that needs to be solved for pCT image reconstruction. The hull-detection algorithms investigated here included silhouette/space carving (SC), modified silhouette/ space carving (MSC), and space modeling (SM). Each was compared to the cone-beam version of filtered backprojection (FBP) used for hull-detection. Data for testing these algorithms included simulated data sets of a digital head phantom and an experimental data set of a pediatric head phantom obtained with a pCT scanner prototype at Loma Linda University Medical Center. SC was the fastest algorithm, exceeding the speed of FBP by more than 100 times. FBP was most sensitive to the presence of noise. Ongoing work will focus on optimizing threshold parameters in order to define a fast and efficient method for hull-detection in pCT image reconstruction.	algorithm;ct scan;fastest;filtered-popping recursive transition network;flow-based programming;imaging phantom;iterative reconstruction;linda (coordination language);linear system;phantom reference;preconditioner;prototype;sparse matrix;system of linear equations;tomography	Blake Schultze;Micah Witt;Yair Censor;Reinhard W.

c0f77f2d70a03e33c4e75f638f3a900de78087a6	excitation and readout designs for high field spectroscopic imaging	electrical engineering and computer science;thesis	In this thesis we state and demonstrate solutions to three engineering problems that arise in magnetic resonance imaging RF excitation with parallel transmission (pTx) and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). Recent work in parallel RF excitation in MRI has been demonstrated to offer dramatically improved flexibility for manipulation of magnetization preparation for imaging than is feasible with conventional single-channel transmission. We address two design problems that need to be solved before this emerging technology can be deployed in the clinical and research domain of human imaging at high field. First, we demonstrate a method for rapid and robust acquisition of the non-uniform fields of RF excitation due to arrays that are commonly used in pTx at high field. Our method achieves high-fidelity single-slice excitation and reception field mapping in 20 seconds, and we propose ways to extend this to multi-slice mapping in two minutes for twenty slices. A fundamental constraint to the application of pTx is the management of the deposition of power in human tissue, quantified by the specific absorption rate (SAR). The complex behavior of the spatial distribution of SAR in transmission arrays poses problems not encountered in conventional single-channel systems, and we propose a pTx design method to incorporate local SAR constraints within computation times that accommodate pTx pulse design during MRI acquisition of human subjects. Our approach builds on recent work to capture local SAR distribution with much lower computational complexity than a brute-force evaluation, and we demonstrate that this approach can reduce peak local SAR by 20~40% for commonly applied pTx design targets. This thesis focuses on the design of excitation methods for high field system (7T parallel transmit (pTx) system) and fast readout and post-processing methods to reduce the lipid contamination to the brain. The contributions include fast B1+ mapping and pTx RF pulse design with the local SAR constraints for excitation. Regarding the readout method we developed a real time filter design, variable density spiral trajectory, and iterative non-linear reconstruction technique that reduce the lipid contamination. The proposed excitation methods were demonstrated using a 7T pTx system and the readout methods were implemented in a 3T system. Our third contribution addresses a recurring problem in MRSI of the brain, namely strong contaminating artifacts in low signal-to-noise ratio brain metabolite maps due to subcutaneous, high-concentration lipid sources. We demonstrate two methods to address this problems, one during the acquisition stage where a spatial filter is designed based on spatial priors acquired from the subject being scanned, and the second is a post-processing method that applies the brain and lipid source prior for further artifact minimization. These methods are demonstrated to achieve 20~4OdB enhancement of lipid suppression in brain MRSI of human subjects.

24e8d3537ab8ffc427f5134648f614753a8e0ec7	debugging object tracking by a recommender system with correction propagation		In biomedical applications such as tracking hundreds of specimens over months, we assume none of the existing visual tracking approaches is capable of achieving 100 percent accuracy in these challenging real-world scenarios. Meanwhile, biological discovery and health diagnosis usually require high-quality tracking results for solid analysis. However, manually debugging (verifying and correcting) tracking results generated by automated tracking algorithms object-by-object and frame-by-frame in thousands of frames is too tedious. In this paper, we investigate how to debug automated object tracking results with humans in the loop. A novel iterative recommender system with correction propagation is proposed to assist multiple human annotators to debug tracking results in an effective, collaborative and efficient way. Tracking data that are highly erroneous are recommended to annotators based on their propagation influence and annotators’ debugging histories. Different annotators debug the tracking data independently and their debugging results are collected for joint correction propagation. Since an error found by an annotator may have many analogous errors in the tracking data and the errors can also affect their nearby data, we propose a correction propagation scheme to propagate corrections from all human annotators to unchecked data which efficiently reduces human efforts and accelerates the convergence to perfect tracking accuracy. Our proposed approach is evaluated on three challenging biological datasets. The quantitative evaluation and comparison validate that the recommender system with correction propagation is effective and efficient to help humans debug tracking results generated by automated tracking algorithms.	algorithm;debugging;iteration;iterative method;pool (computer science);recommender system;software propagation;sparse language;sparse matrix;verification and validation;video tracking	Mingzhong Li;Zhaozheng Yin	2017	IEEE Transactions on Big Data	10.1109/TBDATA.2017.2723022	artificial intelligence;computer science;recommender system;computer vision;debugging;video tracking;algorithm design;big data;eye tracking;convergence (routing)	Vision	42.704874975713466	-86.07295013600881	66750

The newly developed algorithm, termed 'hybrid processing', has three unique features. First, the original image is decomposed into plural frequency bands, and each frequency component is weighted and added back to the original image. Second, at the decomposition stage, rather than employ a conventional simple averaging filter, a binomial filter is used to create unsharp images. Third, an enhancement characteristic is established for each unsharp image based on a smooth compensation function predetermined by the density and contrast of the unsharp image. Hybrid processing was applied to approximately 500 clinical CR images, including images of the chest, abdomen, and extremities. Image decomposition, and the weighting and re-addition of its frequency components produced optimal renditions from low through high frequencies. Further, the binomial filter provided smooth frequency response with a reasonably short processing time. Combined with the enhancement characteristic established for each unsharp image, the binomial filter effectively reduced unfavorable noise enhancement and such artifacts as overshoot and undershoot.© (2003) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

This paper describes a new method for the registration of large Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope sequences (SLO), where the patient has been injected with a fluorescent dye. This allows the measurement of parameters such as the arteriovenous passage time. Due to the long time needed to acquire these sequences, there will inevitably be eye movement, which must be corrected prior to the application of quantitative analysis. The algorithm described here combines mutual information-based registration and landmark-based registration. The former will allow the alignment of the darkest frames of the sequence, where the dye has not still arrived to the retina, because of its ability to work with images without a preprocessing or segmentation, while the latter uses relevant features (the vessels) extracted by means of a robust creaseness operator, to get a very fast and accurate registration. The algorithm only detects rigid transformations but proves to be robust against the slight alterations derived from the eye location perspective during acquisition. Results were validated by expert clinicians.		Cástor Mariño;Marcos Ortega;Noelia Barreira;Manuel G. Penedo;Maria José Carreira;F.

The shape is often recovered from several delineations performed on a two-dimensional gold standard imagery. Using true 3D imagery is attractive to supplement this gold standard. However, before using 3D modalities in clinical routine, it must be proved that these modalities are well suited to the delineation task. We propose in this paper a methodology for validating a new imaging modality with respect to a reference imagery.	astronomy visualization metadata;modality (human–computer interaction)	Marie-Odile Berger;René Anxionnat;Erwan Kerrien	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-30135-6_63	computer vision;radiology;medicine;gold standard;computer science;artificial intelligence;mathematics;statistics	Vision	42.12383125336939	-83.16938892293116	66789
8860dd10008a6d44a386b17d2e23f0ac1e743e6c	an improved nonlinear diffusion in laplacian pyramid domain for cone beam ct denoising during image-guided vascular intervention	edge-preserving smoothing;laplacian pyramid;low-dose cbct;nonlinear diffusion	BACKGROUND Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) acquisition during endovascular aneurysm repair is an emergent technology with more and more applications. It may provide 3-D information to achieve guidance of intervention. However, there is growing concern on the overall radiation doses delivered to patients, thus a low dose protocol is called when scanning. But CBCT images with a low dose protocol are degraded, resulting in streak artifacts and decreased contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). In this paper, a Laplacian pyramid-based nonlinear diffusion is proposed to improve the quality of CBCT images.   METHOD We first transform the CBCT image into its pyramid domain, then a modified nonlinear diffusion is performed in each level to remove noise across edges while keeping edges as far as possible. The improved diffusion coefficient is a function of the gradient magnitude image; the threshold in the modified diffusion function is estimated using the median absolute deviation (MAD) estimator; the time step is automatically determined by iterative image changes and the iteration is stopped according to mean absolute error between two adjacent diffusions. Finally, we reconstruct the Laplacian pyramid using the processed pyramid images in each level.   RESULT Results from simulation show that the filtered image from the proposed method has the highest peak signal-noise ratio (81.92), the highest correlation coefficient (99.77%) and the lowest mean square error (27.61), compared with the other four methods. In addition, it has highest contrast-to-noise ratio and sharpness in ROIs. Results from real CBCT images show that the proposed method shows better smoothness in homogeneous regions meanwhile keeps bony structures clear.   CONCLUSION Simulation and patient studies show that the proposed method has a good tradeoff between noise/artifacts suppression and edge preservation.	aneurysm;approximation error;biologic preservation;ct scan;coefficient;cone beam computed tomography;contrast-to-noise ratio;diffusion;emergence;gradient;iteration;laplacian matrix;least absolute deviations;mad;mean squared error;morphologic artifacts;noise (electronics);noise reduction;nonlinear system;pet/ct scan;patients;pyramid (geometry);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;x-ray computed tomography;zero suppression	Yi Liu;Miguel Castro;Mathieu Lederlin;Adrien Kaladji;Pascal Haigron	2018		10.1186/s12880-018-0269-1	radiology;noise reduction;computed tomography;beam (structure);nonlinear system;laplacian pyramid;edge-preserving smoothing;endovascular aneurysm repair;radiation;medicine	Vision	45.66520623040621	-82.54178338352236	66822

It is therefore important to characterize the flow pattern and pressure distribution within the ventricle in the presence of an LVAD. In this paper, we present a 2D axisymmetric fluid structure interaction model of the passive left ventricle (LV) incorporating an LVAD cannula to simulate the effect of the LVAD cannula placement on the vortex dynamics. Results showed that larger recirculation area was formed at the cannula tip with increasing cannula insertion depth, and this is believed to reduce the risk of thrombus formation. Furthermore, we also simulated suction events (collapse of the LV) by closing the inlet. Vortex patterns were significantly altered under this condition, and the greatest LV wall displacement was observed at the part of the myocardium closest to the cannula tip.	cardiovascular system;clinical act of insertion;closing (morphology);displacement mapping;experiment;heart ventricle;large;left ventricular hypertrophy;left ventricular structure;logical volume management;mechanical circulatory support;myocardium;patients;psychologic displacement;simulation;stanford university centers and institutes;suction drainage;tirap gene;thrombosis;video-in video-out;vortex;left ventricular assist device	C.

561f48d715d6503001ba98a7257efd950dfee2b2	robust detection of mitral papillary muscle from 4d transesophageal echocardiography		Mitral valve (MV) diseases, one of the most common valvular diseases, often require surgical repair to reduce mitral regurgitation and improve cardiac pump function. These procedures however are very complex and require careful planning. In particular, chordae replacement or sub-valvular repair demands a precise assessment of the relative position of the papillary muscles with respect to the leaflets in the beating heart. This can be achieved only before opening the chest through imaging like computerized tomography or trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE). Yet, quantitative analysis of the MV structure and dynamics, in particular the papillaries, is still tedious and prone to user variability. This manuscript presents a novel approach to automatically detect and track papillary muscle tips in 4D TEE. The proposed data-driven method combines the Marginal Space Learning method with Random Sample Consensus and Belief Propagation cope with varying image quality and signal drop-offs. Experiments on 30 randomly-selected volumes show that the accuracy of our algorithm falls within inter-rater variability (5.58mm out of 6.94mm for the anterior tip and 5.75mm out of 7.06mm for the posterior tip), while being extremely fast (under 3 seconds). The proposed method could therefore provide the surgeon with quantitative MV evaluation for optimal therapy planning.	doppler echocardiography	Mihai Scutaru;Ingmar Voigt;Tommaso Mansi;Anand Tatpati;Razvan Ioan Ionasec;Helene Houle;Dorin Comaniciu	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-14678-2_26	mitral valve;belief propagation;papillary muscle;radiology;image quality;computer science	Robotics	41.33041034019875	-83.37423751850059	66904

It is highly desirable to use the MRI technology for interventional procedures. However, due to resonance effects that can result in tissue heating, long conducting cables must be avoided. Motivated by the need for more radio-frequency (RF) safety, we developed an optical transmission system for active intravascular MRI devices. An optical transmitter sends the MR signal via an optical fiber. A miniature optical modulator was designed to be integrated into a catheter tip. Furthermore, power is supplied optically to the transmitter. This system can target new medical applications, due to safe catheter tracking and safe intravascular imaging.	behavior;cable;cns disorder;converter device component;decibel;diode device component;direct transmission;electric power supplies;electric power conversion;endovascular procedures;experiment;fiber-optic communication;hearing loss, high-frequency;heating;image resolution;imaging phantom;intravascular imaging;ionizing radiation;lasers, semiconductor;magnetic resonance imaging;magnetic resonance imaging, interventional;medical imaging;modulation;modulator device component;noise figure;optical fiber;phantoms, imaging;power supply;preparation;providing (action);radio frequency;signal-to-noise ratio;transmitter (medical device);transistor;transistors;transmitter device component;soft tissue	Stephan Fandrey;Steffen Weiss;Jörg Müller	2008	IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging	10.1109/TMI.2008.925079	radiology;medicine;optical fiber;magnetic resonance imaging;medical physics	Vision	25.991939187466105	-86.27219218781319	67124

We suggest an improved two-dimensional anisotropic diffusion model to address the inhomogeneous nature of nuclear organization, which is at odds with the generally applied ’well-mixed’ compartmental assumption. To consider the transfer function of the imaging system, we derived a modified fundamental solution of the two-dimensional, time-dependent diffusion equation. The model was validated through comparison of the forward simulation results with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments using nuclear localization signal (NLS) – tagged YFP recorded by confocal laser scanning microscopy. To improve the fit error in the vicinity of the nuclear boundary, we suggest an isotropic diffusion model with Neumann boundary condition accounting for the exact shape of the nuclear boundary. The suggested approach is a first step towards diffusion tomography of the cell nucleus.	simulation	Dietmar Volz;Martin Eigel;Chaitanya Athale;Peter Bastian;Harald Hermann;Constantin Kappel;Roland Eils	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-25974-9_13	biology;diffusion equation;fundamental solution;computer science;confocal laser scanning microscopy;diffusion;mathematics;nuclear localization sequence;neumann boundary condition;transfer function;spatial organization;fluorescence recovery after photobleaching;anisotropic diffusion	EDA	46.414423689467476	-88.2578186931897	67298

A precise patient-specific segmentation of the thrombus is useful for both the pre-operative planning to estimate the rupture risk, and for post-operative assessment to monitor the disease evolution. This paper presents a generic approach for 3D segmentation of thrombus from patients suffering from AAA using computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans. A fast and versatile thrombus segmentation approach has been developed. It is composed of initial centerline detection and aorta lumen segmentation, an optimized pre-processing stage and the use of a 3D deformable model. The approach has been designed to be very generic and requires minimal user interaction. The proposed method was tested on different datasets with 145 patients overall, including pre- and post-operative CTAs, abdominal aorta and iliac artery sections, different calcification degrees, aneurysm sizes and contrast enhancement qualities. The thrombus segmentation approach showed very accurate results with respect to manual delineations for all datasets ( $$\hbox {Dice} = 0.86 \pm 0.06, 0.81 \pm 0.06$$ Dice = 0.86 ± 0.06 , 0.81 ± 0.06 and $$0.87 \pm 0.03$$ 0.87 ± 0.03 for abdominal aorta sections on pre-operative CTA, iliac artery sections on pre-operative CTAs and aorta sections on post-operative CTA, respectively). Experiments on the different patient and image conditions showed that the method was highly versatile, with no significant differences in term of precision. Comparison with the level-set algorithm also demonstrated the superiority of the 3D deformable model. Average processing time was $$8.2 \pm 3.5 \hbox { s}$$ 8.2 ± 3.5 s . We presented a near-automatic and generic thrombus segmentation algorithm applicable to a large variability of patient and imaging conditions. When integrated in an endovascular planning system, our segmentation algorithm shows its compatibility with clinical routine and could be used for pre-operative planning and post-operative assessment of endovascular procedures.	aaa (video game industry);abdominal aorta structure;aortic aneurysm;aortic aneurysm, abdominal;automated planning and scheduling;bone structure of ilium;ct scan;calcinosis;cancer/testis antigen;computed tomography angiography;computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis;consent forms;endovascular procedures;fetal membranes, premature rupture;generic drugs;hypertrophy;implants;interaction;medical device incompatibility problem;patients;preprocessor;scanning;segmentation action;silo (dataset);spatial variability;steam rupture;stent, device;structure of iliac artery;structure of lumen of body system;thrombosis;algorithm;angiogram;biologic segmentation;standards characteristics	Florent Lalys;Vincent Yan;Adrien Kaladji;Antoine Lucas;Simon Esneault	2017	International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery	10.1007/s11548-017-1591-8	radiology;medicine;surgery;cardiology	Vision	39.56041715111273	-80.218881697194	67389

Even the best automatic segmentation approaches cannot yet provide accurate segmentation in all situations. Hence, there is a persistent need for interactive editing tools to correct the automatic segmentation results such that they match what would be clinically accepted by an expert. We present an editing approach that uses a user-drawn splice (contour) in 2D to correct any 2D or 3D segmentation that may have been obtained automatically or manually. The algorithm integrates the image data, the existing segmentation (presegmentation), and the user's input into an energy minimization framework. We will show that the proposed segmentation editing approach is general and can be used in multiple applications and for multiple imaging modalities.	algorithm;energy minimization;image processing;image segmentation;splice (system call)	Noha El-Zehiry;Marie-Pierre Jolly;Michal Sofka	2013	2013 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging	10.1109/ISBI.2013.6556670	image texture;computer vision;minimisation;image processing;computer science;segmentation-based object categorization;multimedia;image segmentation;scale-space segmentation;user interface;energy minimization;computer graphics (images)	Vision	37.54018370835534	-83.22319986827858	67563

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an ideal modality for surgical guidance of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, with its ability to perform high resolution, real-time, high soft tissue contrast imaging without ionizing radiation. However, for most current image-guided approaches only static pre-operative images are accessible for guidance, which are unable to provide updated information during a surgical procedure. The high magnetic field, electrical interference, and limited access of closed-bore MRI render great challenges to developing robotic systems that can perform inside a diagnostic high-field MRI while obtaining interactively updated MR images. To overcome these limitations, we are developing a piezoelectrically actuated robotic assistant for actuated percutaneous prostate interventions under real-time MRI guidance. Utilizing a modular design, the system enables coherent and straight forward workflow for various percutaneous interventions, including prostate biopsy sampling and brachytherapy seed placement, using various needle driver configurations. The unified workflow compromises: 1) system hardware and software initialization, 2) fiducial frame registration, 3) target selection and motion planning, 4) moving to the target and performing the intervention (e.g. taking a biopsy sample) under live imaging, and 5) visualization and verification. Phantom experiments of prostate biopsy and brachytherapy were executed under MRI-guidance to evaluate the feasibility of the workflow. The robot successfully performed fully actuated biopsy sampling and delivery of simulated brachytherapy seeds under live MR imaging, as well as precise delivery of a prostate brachytherapy seed distribution with an RMS accuracy of 0.98mm.

Among clinically applied modalities for blood flow measurement, color Doppler ultrasound shows two-dimensional (2D) distribution of one-dimensional blood flow component along the ultrasound beam. In the present study, 2D blood flow vector is obtained with high temporal and bidirectional Doppler ultrasound technique. Linear array probe with the central frequency of 7.5 MHz and an ultrasound data acquisition system with 128 transmit and 128 receive channels were equipped. Frame rate of 5 kHz was achieved by parallel receive beam forming with a wide transmitted wave. The flow velocity was measured from two different angles by beam steering. The interval of two measurements was 0.8 msec and it was considered as almost one moment to obtain 2D blood flow vector. B-mode image and 2D blood flow vector of the pulsatile flow in a carotid artery model showed small vortex at the bifurcation area. The method was also applied for visualization of in vivo blood flow vector in human carotid arteries. 2D blood flow measurement may predict the risk area of thrombus and plaque formation induced by abnormal blood flow.	2d doppler echocardiography;atherosclerosis;beamforming;bifurcation theory;carotid arteries;data acquisition;doppler effect;hematological disease;imagery;kilohertz;megahertz;plaque, atherosclerotic;pulse-doppler radar;senile plaques;thrombosis;velocity (software development);video-in video-out;vortex;blood flow measurement;disease transmission	Genta Masuno;Ryo Nagaoka;Aiko Omori;Yasuo Ishikawa;Osamu Akagawa;Mototaka Arakawa;Yoshifumi Saijo	2014	2014 36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/EMBC.2014.6944770	radiology;acoustics;computer science;biological engineering	Visualization	24.61403539305216	-86.55818698568366	67829
b44e339120fa869077d282ec28c07a071d71bf05	towards mri-guided and actuated tetherless milli-robots: preoperative planning and modeling of control		Image-guided and robot-assisted surgical procedures are rapidly evolving due to their potential to improve patient management and cost effectiveness. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is used for pre-operative planning and is also investigated for real-time intra-operative guidance. A new type of technology is emerging that uses the magnetic field gradients of the MR scanner to maneuver ferromagnetic agents for local delivery of therapeutics. With this approach, MRI is both a sensor and forms a closed-loop controlled entity that behaves as a robot (we refer to them as MRbots). The objective of this paper is to introduce a computational framework for preoperative planning using MRI and modeling of MRbot maneuvering inside tortuous blood vessels. This platform generates a virtual corridor that represents a safety zone inside the vessel that is then used to access the safety of the MRbot maneuvering. In addition, to improve safety we introduce a control that sets speed based on the local curvature of the vessel. The functionality of the framework was then tested on a realistic operational scenario of accessing a neurological lesion, a meningioma. This virtual case study demonstrated the functionality and potential of MRbots as well as revealed two primary challenges: real-time MRI (during propulsion) and the need of very strong gradients for maneuvering small MRbots inside narrow cerebral vessels. Our ongoing research focuses on further developing the computational core, MR tracking methods, and on-line interfacing to the MR scanner.	computation;gradient;online and offline;real-time clock;real-time transcription;resonance;robot	Thibault Kensicher;Julien Leclerc;Daniel Biediger;Dipan J.

It is shown that local mean value, standard deviation, and Shannon entropy extracted from the green and blue channel of fundus images are correlated with corresponding RNFL thickness.

Especially it is very important to know the range and position of each device. Because it is useful and important for accurate sensing and controlling a capsule endoscope, micro or nano size of robot for a drug delivery system and a remote medical treatment system. We adopt the time-based approach of position estimation using ultra wideband (UWB) signals. Position estimation methods using the propagation velocity inside human body have been proposed [1]. However, the estimate position is mistaken when propagation velocity is not correctly calculated. In this paper, we proposed a system to estimate the position of medical implant device using slice photographs taken by CT or MRI systems as a map in addition to the estimation of propagation velocity. The compensation becomes possible by image information when the estimated position is an area where the device doesn't exist (ex: capsule endoscopes excluding the digestive system) and is calculated. This is similar to a car navigation system. We compared our proposed method to the method of estimation using only propagation velocity and showd the utility.	3d modeling;algorithm;artificial cardiac pacemaker;automotive navigation system;gnu nano;robot;simulation;software propagation;ultra-wideband;velocity (software development)	Hiroshi Takayama;Chika Sugimoto;Ryuji Kohno	2010	2010 International Symposium On Information Theory & Its Applications	10.1109/ISITA.2010.5649808	medical imaging;estimation;electronic engineering;human body;digestion;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;ultra-wideband;biological engineering;wireless;statistics;permittivity	Robotics	41.681443776274826	-85.44895963222494	68573
4cd2d89dcd82c1b68459acda796c1dbe3cf9c004	deep learning-based sinogram completion for low-dose ct		Patient radiation dose associated with $X$-ray CT is a significant concern in the medical community. One of the ways to reduce patient dose is to acquire projection data at fewer angles. Using conventional reconstruction methods with such sparsely sampled data introduces severe streaking artifacts in the reconstructions, that reduces their diagnostic utility. Conventional methods in this domain have focused on postprocessing the artifact-filled images or the use of model-based inversion techniques with image-domain priors. In this work, we examine the potential of a deep-learning-based method to construct a mapping from the observed, sparsely sampled, CT projection data to a set of densely sampled projection estimates directly in the original projection domain. We cast the problem as one of sinogram in-painting and focus on completing the projection data prior to reconstructing the images. As compared to existing work, we focus on “correcting” the data rather than the subsequent images and avoid costly iterative tomographic inversion. Our initial results on a simulated dataset demonstrate the potential effectiveness of this new approach in suppressing artifacts.	artifact (software development);deep learning;iterative method;tomographic reconstruction	Muhammad Usman Ghani;W.

High-energy (HE) and low-energy (LE) images of the breast are acquired; the DE image is obtained by a weighted logarithmic subtraction of the image pair. We hypothesized that the optimal DE subtraction weighting factor, w, is dependent on three parameters: breast thickness, kV, and filter material. We simulated the attenuation of x-rays through breasts of thicknesses ranging from 0.5 to 10 cm using different filter and kV combinations. The glandularity of the phantom for a given thickness was varied using different combinations of adipose and glandular tissues. We calculated the logarithm of the LE and HE signal intensities. For a given kV-filter pair, the signals decrease with increasing tissue thickness and glandularity. The DE weighting factor is thickness-dependent, and it decreases with increasing energy difference between the LE-HE kV pairs. These results facilitate the subtraction of tissue in the periphery of the breast, and aid in discriminating between contrast agent uptake in glandular tissue and subtraction artefacts.	phantom reference;thickness (graph theory)	Kristen C.

To prevent and treat these disabling conditions, we are building an accurate generic lower limb model (consisting of bones and soft tissues) that can be simulated in motion, using individual multimodal data. For clinical every-day use, medically relevant validation and an efficient interactive visualization framework are required. Relevant patientpsilas anatomical, kinematical and mechanical data extracted from images (MRI), motion capture (dynamic MRI, optical motion capture) and other modalities (body scanning, EMG, mechanical properties measuring device), as well as statistical data, are adjusting the generic model to the patient.

Especially, T2 prime (T2') that can be derived from T2 and T2* are clinically valuable for delineation of areas with increased oxygen extraction fraction in acute stroke. However, there are limitations in this method because it requires acquisition of many images for the generation of T2 and T2* relaxation time maps. In particular, time saving is the most important factor in acquisition of MRI in acute ischemic stroke because therapy should be given to patients as soon as possible. Therefore, to reduce the acquisition time of MR data, we use a compressed sensing algorithm using patch based low rank penalty for the reconstruction of T2 and T2* weighted images to obtain the T2 prime map. Our results showed that significant acceleration in T2' image acquisition is possible using the proposed method.	algorithm;compressed sensing;linear programming relaxation;map;resonance	Dongwook Lee;Eung-Yeop Kim;Huisu Yoon;Sunghong Park;Jong Chul Ye	2014	2014 IEEE 11th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)	10.1109/ISBI.2014.6867953	computer vision;mathematical optimization;mathematics;nuclear magnetic resonance	Vision	47.48194229784063	-82.27844590983871	69143

Recent advances in Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) technology warrant a rigorous evaluation of both the specialized and the mass market displays for clinical radiology. This article outlines step two in the evaluation of a novel 9.2 million pixel IBM AMLCD panel. Prior to these experiments, the panel was calibrated according to the DICOM Part 14 standard, using both a gray-scale and a pseudo-gray scale lookup table. The specific aim of this study is to compare human, contrast-detail perception on different computer display subsystems. The subsystems that we looked at included 3- and 5-million pixel “medical-grade” monochrome LCDs and a 9.2-million pixel color LCD. We found that the observer response was similar for these three display configurations.	computer monitor;dicom;equilibrium;experiment;grayscale;inclusion body myositis (disorder);lookup table;mathematical optimization;monochrome;outlines (document);pixel;pseudo brand of pseudoephedrine;radiology	Alice N.

This manual approach is time consuming, subjective, prone to error, and not suitable for measuring dynamic change. In this study, we developed an automated tracking method based on an optical flow algorithm using an affine motion model. The goal of the study was to evaluate the performance of the proposed method by comparing it with the manual approach. Real-time B-mode ultrasound was used to exam the rectus femoris muscle during voluntary contraction. The manual and automated methods were compared by linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis. The findings showed that the proposed method was in good agreement with the manual approach.	algorithm;maximum flow problem;medical ultrasound;optical flow;real-time transcription;thickness (graph theory)	Xin Chen;Yanrong Guo;Wanguan Yi;Qiaoliang Li	2012	2012 International Conference on Computerized Healthcare (ICCH)	10.1109/ICCH.2012.6724474	computer vision;simulation;engineering;computer graphics (images)	Robotics	41.138428465434004	-81.93169281479764	69397
06e01273930835f5d10f2c4e30fdb654b80b96b3	framework for shape analysis of white matter fiber bundles	development;shape analysis;white matter	Diffusion imaging coupled with tractography algorithms allows researchers to image human white matter fiber bundles in-vivo. These bundles are three-dimensional structures with shapes that change over time during the course of development as well as in pathologic states. While most studies on white matter variability focus on analysis of tissue properties estimated from the diffusion data, e.g. fractional anisotropy, the shape variability of white matter fiber bundle is much less explored. In this paper, we present a set of tools for shape analysis of white matter fiber bundles, namely: (1) a concise geometric model of bundle shapes; (2) a method for bundle registration between subjects; (3) a method for deformation estimation. Our framework is useful for analysis of shape variability in white matter fiber bundles. We demonstrate our framework by applying our methods on two datasets: one consisting of data for 6 normal adults and another consisting of data for 38 normal children of age 11 days to 8.5 years. We suggest a robust and reproducible method to measure changes in the shape of white matter fiber bundles. We demonstrate how this method can be used to create a model to assess age-dependent changes in the shape of specific fiber bundles. We derive such models for an ensemble of white matter fiber bundles on our pediatric dataset and show that our results agree with normative human head and brain growth data. Creating these models for a large pediatric longitudinal dataset may improve understanding of both normal development and pathologic states and propose novel parameters for the examination of the pediatric brain.	algorithm;fractional anisotropy;geometric modeling;shape analysis (digital geometry);silo (dataset);spatial variability;tissue fiber;video-in video-out;white matter;registration - actclass	Tanya Glozman;Lisa Bruckert;Franco Pestilli;Derek W.

With few exceptions, a more precise correspondence between physiological or biophysical properties and the obtained diffusion parameters remain uncertain due to lack of specificity. In this work, we address this problem by comparing diffusion parameters of a recently introduced model for water diffusion in brain matter to light microscopy and quantitative electron microscopy. Specifically, we compare diffusion model predictions of neurite density in rats to optical myelin staining intensity and stereological estimation of neurite volume fraction using electron microscopy. We find that the diffusion model describes data better and that its parameters show stronger correlation with optical and electron microscopy, and thus reflect myelinated neurite density better than the more frequently used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and cumulant expansion methods. Furthermore, the estimated neurite orientations capture dendritic architecture more faithfully than DTI diffusion ellipsoids.	anatomic structures;anatomical compartments;arc converter;biological markers;cylinder seal;cylinder-head-sector;dendrites;diffusion tensor imaging;diffusion weighted imaging;electron microscopy;estimated;light microscopy;linear programming relaxation;magnetic resonance imaging;mathematics;multi-compartment model;myelin sheath;relaxation (approximation);sensitivity and specificity;staining intensity;staining method;transverse wave;volume fraction;white matter;word lists by frequency	Sune Nørhøj Jespersen;Carsten R.

In simulation, the advantages of such methods are readily demonstrable. However, quantitative empirical validation remains elusive in vivo as the true connectivity patterns are unknown and noise distributions are challenging to characterize, especially in ultra-high field (e.g., 7T fMRI). Though the physiological characteristics of the fMRI signal are difficult to replicate in controlled phantom studies, it is critical that the performance of statistical techniques be evaluated. The SIMulation EXtrapolation (SIMEX) method has enabled estimation of bias with asymptotically consistent estimators on empirical finite sample data by adding simulated noise . To avoid the requirement of accurate estimation of noise structure, the proposed quantitative evaluation approach leverages the theoretical core of SIMEX to study the properties of inference methods in the face of diminishing data (in contrast to increasing noise). The performance of ordinary and robust inference methods in simulation and empirical rs-fMRI are compared using the proposed quantitative evaluation approach. This study provides a simple, but powerful method for comparing a proxy for inference accuracy using empirical data.	advance directive - proxy;basal ganglia diseases;imaging phantom;inference;interphase cell;magnetic resonance imaging;phantoms, imaging;proxy server;resting state fmri;self-replicating machine;sensitivity and specificity;simulation;video-in video-out	Xue Yang;Hakmook Kang;Allen T.

We precomputed rescaled versions (pyramid) of the CT volume and of the C-arm images. We perform the registration of the CT to the C-arm images starting from their coarsest resolution until we reach some finer resolution that offers a good compromise between time and accuracy. To achieve precision, we use a cubic-spline data model to compute the data pyramids, the DRRs, and the gradient and the Hessian of the cost function. We validate our algorithm on a 3D CT and on C-arm images of a cadaver spine using fiducial markers. When registering the CT to two C-arm images, our algorithm operates safely if the angle between the two image planes is larger than 10◦. It achieves an accuracy of approximately 2.0±1.0 mm.	algorithm;cadaver;cubic hermite spline;cubic function;data model;fiducial marker;gradient;hessian;loss function;multiresolution analysis;precomputation;spline (mathematics)	Slavica Jonic;Philippe Thévenaz;Michael A.

In this research, phantoms were used to relate image quality differences to the performance of the multiple components of our microcalcification CADe scheme, and to identify to what extent, if any, each CADe component is likely to require modification for FFDM. We compared multiple image quality metrics for a dSFM imaging chain (GE DMR, MinR-2000 and Lumisiys digitizer) and an FFDM system (GE Senographe 2000D) and related them to CADe performance for images of 1) contrast-detail phantom disks and 2) microcalcification phantoms (bone fragments and cadaver breasts). Higher object signal-to noise ratio (SNR) in FFDM compared with dSFM (p<0.05 for 62% of disks, and p>0.05 for 32% of disks) led to superior CADe signal and cluster detection FROC performance. Signal segmentation was comparable (p>0.05 for 74% of disks) in dSFM and FFDM and superior in FFDM (p<0.05) for 19% of disks. Better FFDM temporal stability led to more reproducible CADe performance. For microcalcification phantoms, seven of eight computer-calculated features performed better or comparably (p<0.05) at classifying trueand false-positive detections in FFDM. In conclusion, the image quality improvements offered by FFDM compared to dSFM led to comparable or improved performance of the multiple stages of our CADe scheme for microcalcification detection.	algorithm;cadaver;computer-aided design;database;dual modular redundancy;experiment;image quality;imaging phantom;national computational infrastructure national facility (australia);performance;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio	Laura M.

20c497d5fc4d20c4f73b642eb68aabd901ef1acc	numerical simulation of the stress-strain state of the dental system		We present mathematical models, computational algorithms and software, which can be used for prediction of results of prosthetic treatment. More interest issue is biomechanics of the periodontal complex because any prosthesis is accompanied by a risk of overloading the supporting elements. Such risk can be avoided by the proper load distribution and prediction of stresses that occur during the use of dentures. We developed the mathematical model of the periodontal complex and its software implementation. This model is based on linear elasticity theory and allows to calculate the stress and strain fields in periodontal ligament and jawbone. The input parameters for the developed model can be divided into two groups. The first group of parameters describes the mechanical properties of periodontal ligament, teeth and jawbone (for example, elasticity of periodontal ligament etc.). The second group characterized the geometric properties of objects: the size of the teeth, their spatial coordinates, the size of periodontal ligament etc. The mechanical properties are the same for almost all, but the input of geometrical data is complicated because of their individual characteristics. In this connection, we develop algorithms and software for processing of images obtained by computed tomography (CT) scanner and for constructing individual digital model of the tooth-periodontal ligament-jawbone system of the patient.

For nonsinusoidal pulses that are often used, the two procedures are to treat the exposure as a multifrequency exposure with various frequency components or to calculate the peak induced current densities or electric fields treating the highest of the pulses of duration t/sub p/ as a single frequency, half sinusoid of the same duration and frequency 1/(2t/sub p/). Using either of the procedures, the induced current densities (J) or electric fields (E) are compared to the basic restrictions on J or E for compliance testing. Using a heterogeneous, tissue-classified anatomic model of the human body, we calculate the induced J and E for the various tissues for a realistic, EAS system for two typical nonsinusoidal pulses to show that the two methods give substantially different results. While the approximate but simpler method of treating the pulse as a half sinusoid results in peak induced J or E that may be compliant with safety guidelines, the rigorous method of treating such exposures as multifrequency exposures gives induced current densities or electric fields that may be up to twice as large, thus making such systems potentially noncompliant with the safety guidelines. Since it is more accurate, it is suggested that safety assessment based on the Fourier analysis leading to multifrequency components be used for compliance testing of such devices.	approximation algorithm;body tissue;classification;common vulnerabilities and exposures;compliance behavior;conformance testing;electroconvulsive therapy;electronic article surveillance;fourier analysis;genetic heterogeneity;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;density;electric field	Gang Kang;Om P.

The technique combines a highly undersampled radial gradient echo acquisition with an image reconstruction utilizing both parallel imaging and compressed sensing. Simulations on an in silico phantom were performed to determine the achievable acceleration factor and to optimize regularization parameters. Several parameters characterizing the quality of the reconstructed images (such as spatial and temporal image sharpness or compartment areas) were calculated for this purpose. Subsequently, double-gated segmented cine data as well as non-gated undersampled real-time data using only six projections per timeframe (temporal resolution ~ 10 ms) were acquired in a mid-ventricular slice of four normal mouse hearts in vivo. The highly accelerated data sets were then subjected to the introduced reconstruction technique and results were validated against the fully sampled references. Functional parameters obtained from real-time and fully sampled data agreed well with a comparable accuracy for left-ventricular volumes and a slightly larger scatter for mass. This study introduces and validates a real-time cine-MRI technique, which significantly reduces scan time in preclinical cardiac functional imaging and has the potential to investigate mouse models with abnormal heart rhythm.	anatomical compartments;animal model;bibliographic reference;cine procedure;compressed sensing;computational human phantom;computer simulation;functional imaging;gradient;heart valve disease;iterative reconstruction;large;multi-compartment model;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;phantoms, imaging;phenotype determination;projections and predictions;radial (radio);radial basis function network;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time data;real-time transcription;resonance;sampling - surgical action;temporal lobe;ventricular function;ventricular arrhythmia;video-in video-out;heart rhythm	Tobias Wech;Nicole Seiberlich;Andreas Schindele;Vicente Grau;Leonie Diffley;Michael L.

Time consumption of data processing can be prohibitive particularly in systems intended for continuous monitoring of time-varying targets in various applications. Recently, two promising approximate computational approaches have been proposed to reduce the computational cost of image reconstruction. These approaches are based on reduced-order approximation of the associated computational models. In this paper, we utilize these techniques to reduce the computational cost of 3-D nonstationary EIT imaging when high image reconstruction rate is required due to rapid changes or instabilities in the target of interest. The feasibility of the proposed reduced-order approach is evaluated in simulation and experimental studies. The results show that computational cost in nonstationary image reconstruction can be decreased significantly with reduced-order modeling, and in addition, with an appropriate reduced-order representation of the system state, the effects on the accuracy are very small.	algorithmic efficiency;approximation algorithm;characteristic impedance;computation;computational complexity theory;computational model;electromagnetically induced transparency;iterative reconstruction;nominal impedance;simulation;tomography	Arto Voutilainen;Antti Lipponen;Tuomo Savolainen;Anssi Lehikoinen;Marko Vauhkonen;Jari P.

6c224dfc1a6d75055bbd1de292fc2e693c9c7357	vision-based intraoperative cone-beam ct stitching for non-overlapping volumes		Cone-Beam Computed Tomography CBCT is one of the primary imaging modalities in radiation therapy, dentistry, and orthopedic interventions. While providing crucial intraoperative imaging, CBCT is bounded by its limited imaging volume, motivating the use of image stitching techniques. Current methods rely on overlapping volumes, leading to an excessive amount of radiation exposure, or on external tracking hardware, which may increase the setup complexity. We attach an optical camera to a CBCT enabled C-arm, and co-register the video and X-ray views. Our novel algorithm recovers the spatial alignment of non-overlapping CBCT volumes based on the observed optical views, as well as the laser projection provided by the X-ray system. First, we estimate the transformation between two volumes by automatic detection and matching of natural surface features during the patient motion. Then, we recover 3D information by reconstructing the projection of the positioning-laser onto an unknown curved surface, which enables the estimation of the unknown scale. We present a full evaluation of the methodology, by comparing vision- and registration-based stitching.	ct scan	Bernhard Fuerst;Javad Fotouhi;Nassir Navab	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-24553-9_48	computer vision;medicine;medical physics	Vision	41.17777593276819	-84.70296883410604	70958

The method allows for the rapid calculation of sensitivity profiles from images, and it is proposed here that the approach can be used in functional MRI to obtain reconstructed images in little time. Functional MRI relying on fast parallel reconstruction techniques naturally lends itself to a method that can generate and use sensitivity maps directly from images.	coefficient;iterative reconstruction;map;resonance	Quang Minh Tieng;Viktor Vegh;Gary J.

The registration of intra-operative ultrasound images with preoperative magnetic resonance images is still a challenging problem. In this study a new hybrid method based on residual complexity is proposed for this problem. A new two stages method based on the matching echogenic structures such as sulci is achieved by optimizing the residual complexity (RC) value with quantized coefficients between the ultrasound image and the probabilistic map of MR image. The proposed method is a compromise between feature-based and intensity-based approaches. The evaluation is performed on both a brain phantom and patient data set. The results of the phantom data set confirmed that the proposed method outperforms the accuracy of conventional RC by 39%. Also the mean of fiducial registration errors reached to 1.45, 1.94 mm when the method was applied on phantom and clinical data set, respectively. This hybrid method based on RC enables non-rigid multimodal image registration in a computational time compatible with clinical use as well as being accurate.	coefficient;fiducial marker;image registration;matching;multimodal interaction;muscle rigidity;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;postoperative residual curarization;resonance;science of neurosurgery;time complexity;registration - actclass;replication compartment	Parastoo Farnia;Alireza Ahmadian;T.

472f61cc30682b4c6bb3a65f2ee238aa3e123cf4	variability of the dielectric properties due to tissue heterogeneity and its influence on the development of em phantoms		Electromagnetic phantoms are either software tools or physical materials that emulate the dielectric properties of biological tissues. Among them, muscle, fat and skin phantoms are some of the most used ones. For their proper development, careful knowledge of the dielectric properties of their respective real tissues is required. In general, the data of a measurement campaign-Gabriel's database generally - are used as target reference values, without considering their variability due to issues such as tissue heterogeneity, sample condition or subject's age. These aspects may have a significant impact in the range of the values of the dielectric properties, and thus using just their mean values may not be the best choice for all kinds of experiments. In this paper, the variability of the in vivo dielectric properties of abdominal tissues such as muscle, fat, skin, stomach serosa, small intestine serosa and colon serosa due to their heterogeneity is presented. For this purpose, a measurement campaign has been performed on 3 different porcine subjects using the open-ended coaxial method in the 0.5–26.5 GHz frequency band. Several measurements were driven in different tissue locations of each specimen. The mean values are compared to in vivo measurements presented in literature so far, whereas possible implications of tissue heterogeneity for developing phantoms for certain applications are briefly discussed.

Automatic parsing and segmentation of multiple organs and semantic navigation inside the body can help the clinician in efficiently obtaining accurate diagnosis. However, dealing with the large amount of data of a full body scan is challenging and techniques are needed for the fast detection and segmentation of organs, e.g., heart, liver, kidneys, bladder, prostate, and spleen, and body landmarks, e.g., bronchial bifurcation, coccyx tip, sternum, lung tips. Solving the problem becomes even more challenging if partial body scans are used, where not all organs are present. We propose a new approach to this problem, in which a network of 1D and 3D landmarks is trained to quickly parse the 3D CT data and estimate which organs and landmarks are present as well as their most probable locations and boundaries. Using this approach, the segmentation of seven organs and detection of 19 body landmarks can be obtained in about 20 seconds with state-of-the-art accuracy and has been validated on 80 CT full or partial body scans.	bifurcation theory;full-body ct scan;parsing	Sascha Seifert;Adrian Barbu;Shaohua Kevin Zhou;David Liu;Johannes Feulner;Martin Huber;Michael Sühling;Alexander Cavallaro;Dorin Comaniciu	2009		10.1117/12.812214	computed tomography;heart	Vision	38.30507974532537	-80.66318297000439	71041

The shape-based approach offers several advantages compared to more traditional pixel-based approaches when targeting the reconstruction of key characteristics of a hidden tumor such as its correct size, shape, and static permittivity value. In addition to these key characteristics of hidden tumors, we aim at estimating the correct interfaces between fatty and fibroglandular tissue in the breast and their internal permittivity profiles. The level set strategy (which is an implicit representation of the shapes) frees us from topological restrictions when reconstructing an a priori arbitrary number of tumors and the often quite complicated interfaces between fatty and fibroglandular regions. The presented strategy is able to detect and, in most cases, characterize tumors whose sizes (diameters) are much smaller than the wavelengths of the electromagnetic waves that are used for illuminating the breast. We present numerical results for a 2-D model with two distinct tissue types (fatty and fibroglandular) in the interior of the breast (in addition to a possible tumor and the surrounding skin). Our results demonstrate the performance and potential of our scheme in various simulated but realistic situations.	algorithmic efficiency;anomaly detection;breast fibroglandular tissue;computation;dvd region code;diameter (qualifier value);early diagnosis;estimated;histocompatibility testing;iterative method;mammary neoplasms;microwave;numerical analysis;pixel;scientific publication;sensor;silo (dataset);simulation;small;sound waves;stage 0 breast carcinoma;algorithm;cellular targeting;wavelength	Natalia Irishina;Miguel Moscoso;Oliver Dorn	2009	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2009.2012398	iterative reconstruction;electromagnetic radiation;radiology;medicine;pathology;shape;level set;breast cancer;adipose tissue;skin;biological engineering;tomography;permittivity;cancer;medical physics	Visualization	46.47238932477527	-84.9075547633233	71258

One problem is to match the planning data, derived from preoperative CT or MR images, with 3D ultrasound images of the liver, acquired during surgery. As the liver deforms significantly in the intraoperative situation non-rigid registration is necessary. This is a particularly challenging task because pre- and intraoperative image data stem from different modalities and ultrasound images are generally very noisy. One way to overcome these problems is to incorporate prior knowledge into the registration process. We propose a method of combining anatomical landmark information with a fast non-parametric intensity registration approach. Mathematically, this leads to a constrained optimization problem. As distance measure we use the normalized gradient field which allows for multimodal image registration. A qualitative and quantitative validation on clinical liver data sets of three different patients has been performed. We used the distance of dense corresponding points on vessel center lines for quantitative validation. The combined landmark and intensity approach improves the mean and percentage of point distances above 3 mm compared to rigid and thin-plate spline registration based only on landmarks. The proposed algorithm offers the possibility to incorporate additional a priori knowledge—in terms of few landmarks—provided by a human expert into a non-rigid registration process.	algorithm;blood vessel tissue;ct scan;constrained optimization;constraint (mathematics);data validation;distance;gradient;hans moravec;image registration;liver diseases;mathematical optimization;medical ultrasound;multimodal interaction;muscle rigidity;mutual information;optimization problem;patients;population parameter;surgery, computer-assisted;thin plate spline;quantitative;registration - actclass	Thomas Lange;Nils Papenberg;Stefan Heldmann;Jan Modersitzki;Bernd Fischer;Hans Lamecker;Peter M.

Twenty-one patients with acquired cardiac diseases were enrolled and underwent two-dimensional (2D) and 3D cine cardiac SSFP MR imaging using a 1.5T unit. Sensitivity encoding (n=12) and k-t broad-use linear acquisition speed-up (BLAST; n=9) were employed for the 3D cine imaging. High correlations for cardiac functional parameters were observed between 2D and 3D cine images (P<0.0001, r>0.94). However, end-diastolic volume and ejection fraction of the left ventricle were significantly lower in the 3D cine imaging with k-t BLAST than in the 2D cine imaging (P<0.0025). On the other hand, k-t BLAST allowed for a shorter breath-holding time owing to the higher acceleration factor. In conclusion, the single-breath-hold 3D cine imaging combined with speed-up techniques provided global cardiac functional parameters comparable to 2D cine imaging.

In Part I of a two-part paper, the authors develop a nonactive antenna compensation model for incorporation in model-based near-field microwave image reconstruction methods. The model treats the nonactive members of the antenna array as impedance boundary conditions applied over a cylindrical surface of finite radius providing two parameters, the effective antenna radius and impedance factor, which can be determined empirically from measured data. Results show that the effective radius and impedance factor provide improved fits to experimental data in homogeneous phantoms where measurements are obtained with and without the presence of the nonactive antenna elements. Once deduced, these parameters are incorporated into the nonactive antenna compensation model and lead to systematic data-model match improvements in heterogeneous phantoms. While the improvements afforded by the nonactive antenna model are small on a per measurement basis, they are not insignificant. As shown in Part II (see ibid., vol. 18, no. 6, p. 508, 1999), inclusion of this new model for nonactive antenna compensation produces significantly higher quality image reconstructions from measurements obtained with a fixed-array data acquisition system over the frequency band 500-900 MHz.	antenna device component;bone structure of radius;characteristic impedance;data acquisition;data model;distortion;fits;frequency band;genetic heterogeneity;interaction;iterative reconstruction;megahertz;microwave;phantoms, imaging;quantitative impedance;smart antenna	Keith D.

SSMs were constructed from a training set of landmarks. The landmarks of the 3D shapes are extracted automatically using marching cubes and point correspondences are automatically obtained via a volumetric non-rigid registration technique using multiresolution B-Spline deformations. The surface registration resulted in no discernible differences between bone shapes, demonstrating the high accuracy of the registration method.

MR offers a great potential to study brain development in vivo despite a number of challenges including maternal breathing, fetal movement, long acquisition times, low spatial resolution and signal to noise. Acquired fetal MR data are often of poor quality compared to adult ones further impeding quantification. Here we present an optimized acquisition scheme with a retrospective correction methodology of motion induced artifacts for 1H MR spectroscopy of the fetal brain that recovers lost signal from the spectra and improves metabolite concentration quantification by lowering the standard deviation of uncertainty.	resonance;video-in video-out	Iordanis E.

However, the stimulation comfort of textile electrodes and the mechanism behind stimulation discomfort is still unknown. In this study, a textile stimulation electrode was developed using conductive fabrics and then its impedance spectroscopy, stimulation thresholds, and stimulation comfort were quantitatively assessed and compared with those of a wet textile electrode and a hydrogel electrode on healthy subjects. The equivalent circuit models and the finite element models of different types of electrode were built based on the measured impedance data of the electrodes to reveal the possible mechanism of electrical stimulation pain. Our results showed that the wet textile electrode could achieve similar stimulation performance as the hydrogel electrode in motor threshold and stimulation comfort. However, the dry textile electrode was found to have very low pain threshold and induced obvious cutaneous painful sensations during stimulation, in comparison to the wet and hydrogel electrodes. Indeed, the finite element modeling results showed that the activation function along the z direction at the depth of dermis epidermis junction of the dry textile electrode was significantly larger than that of the wet and hydrogel electrodes, thus resulting in stronger activation of pain sensing fibers. Future work will be done to make textile electrodes have similar stimulation performance and comfort as hydrogel electrodes.	activation function;characteristic impedance;dermis;dielectric spectroscopy;electric stimulation technique;epidermis;equivalent circuit;finite element method;functional electrical stimulation;hydrogel;implantable stimulation electrodes;large;movement;neuromuscular electrical stimulation;pain;quantitative impedance;spectrum analyzer;textiles;tissue fiber;vasculitis, leukocytoclastic, cutaneous;wearable computer;electric impedance;electrode;facilitation;zinc pyrithione 10 mg/ml medicated shampoo	Hui Zhou;Yi Lu;Wanzhen Chen;Zhen Wu;Haiqing Zou;Ludovic A.

38cbfd7ee4b969b38b8e9afceec275fdd98eced0	applying a cad-generated imaging marker to assess short-term breast cancer risk		Although whether using computer-aided detection (CAD) helps improve radiologists’ performance in reading and interpreting mammograms is controversy due to higher false-positive detection rates, objective of this study is to investigate and test a new hypothesis that CAD-generated false-positives, in particular, the bilateral summation of false-positives, is a potential imaging marker associated with short-term breast cancer risk. An image dataset involving negative screening mammograms acquired from 1,044 women was retrospectively assembled. Each case involves 4 images of craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) view of the left and right breasts. In the next subsequent mammography screening, 402 cases were positive for cancer detected and 642 remained negative. A CAD scheme was applied to process all “prior” negative mammograms. Some features from CAD scheme were extracted, which include detection seeds, the total number of false-positive regions, an average of detection scores and the sum of detection scores in CC and MLO view images. Then the features computed from two bilateral images of left and right breasts from either CC or MLO view were combined. In order to predict the likelihood of each testing case being positive in the next subsequent screening, two logistic regression models were trained and tested using a leave-one-case-out based cross-validation method. Data analysis demonstrated the maximum prediction accuracy with an area under a ROC curve of AUC=0.65±0.017 and the maximum adjusted odds ratio of 4.49 with a 95% confidence interval of [2.95, 6.83]. The results also illustrated an increasing trend in the adjusted odds ratio and risk prediction scores (pu003c0.01). Thus, the study showed that CAD-generated false-positives might provide a new quantitative imaging marker to help assess short-term breast cancer risk.	computer-aided design	Seyedehnafiseh Mirniaharikandehei;Ali Zarafshani;Morteza Heidari;Yunzhi Wang;Faranak Aghaei;Bin Zheng	2018		10.1117/12.2291527	breast cancer;radiology;cancer;logistic regression;odds ratio;mammography;confidence interval;medicine	Vision	37.10782360256898	-81.55920046849234	71895

Methods: The penetration properties of 13 human hearts were compared to the deployment and fixation energy of the tines to determine if the tines could be easily deployed and removed from the myocardium. The safety factor for dislodgement was calculated by comparing the kinetic energy of the device to the fixation energy of the tines. The fixation stability was tested in 113 chronic implants across 89 animals via pacing threshold measurements or evidence of dislodgement at necropsy. Results: Based on the tine fixation and tissue energy analysis, the tines can easily penetrate the heart. The tines can be safely removed from the myocardium based on the increased tine surface area during retraction. There were no dislodgements observed in the animals and the mean pacing threshold at implant was 0.59 +/- 0.21 V and at termination was 0.65 +/- 0.36 V. The safety factor for dislodgement was determined to be 15X during simulated exercise conditions. Conclusion: The nitinol tine fixation design enabled the implant of a self-contained pacemaker within the right ventricle and was effective in meeting the design requirements. Significance: This fixation technology provides a novel solution to enable the attachment of a transcatheter pacemaker directly within the heart.	artificial cardiac pacemaker;attachments;autopsy;deploy;eighty nine;heart ventricle;kinetics;myocardium;nickel titanium;requirement;right ventricular structure;session fixation;tine test;tines	Michael Eggen;Vladimir Grubac;Matthew Bonner	2015	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2015.2449320	acceleration;biological engineering;force;heart;physics;quantum mechanics;surgery;cardiology	Mobile	27.876621784190178	-86.20240750796215	71951

Both RR and NRR were applied retrospectively to 11 CT-guided percutaneous cryoablation procedures performed to treat renal tumors (mean diameter; 23 mm). Pre-procedural contrast-enhanced MR images of the upper abdomen were registered to unenhanced intra-procedural CT images obtained just prior to the ablation. RRs were performed manually, and NRRs were performed using an intensity-based approach with affine and Basis-Spline techniques used for modeling displacement. Registration accuracy for each technique was assessed using the 95% Hausdorff distance (HD), Fiducial Registration Error (FRE) and the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). Statistical differences were analyzed using a two-sided Student’s t-test. Time for each registration technique was recorded. Mean 95% HD (1.7 mm), FRE (1.7 mm) and DSC (0.96) using the NRR technique were significantly better than mean 95% HD (6.4 mm), FRE (5.0 mm) and DSC (0.88) using the RR technique (P < 0.05 for each analysis). Mean registration times of NRR and RR techniques were 15.2 and 5.7 min, respectively. The non-rigid registration technique was more accurate than the rigid registration technique when fusing pre-procedural MR images to intra-procedural unenhanced CT images. The non-rigid registration technique can be used to improve visualization of renal tumors during CT-guided cryoablation procedures.	ablation;b-spline;ct scan;coefficient;cryosurgery;diameter (qualifier value);displacement mapping;fiducial marker;hausdorff dimension;image registration;imagery;kidney neoplasm;maxima and minima;muscle rigidity;neoplasms;psychologic displacement;rapid refresh;non-t, non-b childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia;registration - actclass;t test	Sota Oguro;Kemal Tuncali;Haytham Elhawary;Paul R.

Local scale - a fundamental image property that is derivable entirely from the image and that does not require any prior knowledge about the imaging protocol or object material property distributions - is used to obtain a set of homogeneous regions, no matter what each region is, and to fit a 2nd degree polynomial to the intensity variation within them. This polynomial is used to correct the intensity variation. The above procedure is repeated for the corrected image until the size of segmented homogeneous regions does not change significantly from that in the previous iteration. Intensity scale standardization is effected to make sure that the corrected images are not biased by the fitting strategy. The method has been tested on 1000 3D mathematical phantoms, which include 5 levels each of blurring and noise and 4 types of background variation - additive and multiplicative Gaussian and ramp. It has also been tested on 10 clinical MRI data sets of the brain. These tests, and a comparison with the method of homomorphic filtering, indicate the effectiveness of the method.© (2002) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

Iterative reconstruction techniques combined with parallel MRI have been proposed to reduce the data acquisition time, which is the biggest drawback of 4D PCI. The novel LoSDeCoS technique combines these ideas with the separation into a low-rank and a sparse component. The high-dimensionality of the PC data renders it ideally suited for this approach. The proposed method is not limited to a single body region, but can be applied to any 4D flow measurement. The benefits of the new method are twofold: It allows to significantly accelerate the acquisition; and generates additional images highlighting temporal and directional flow changes. Reduction in acquisition time improves patient comfort and can be used to achieve better temporal or spatial resolution, which in turn allows more precise calculations of clinically important quantitative numbers such as flow rates or the wall shear stress. With LoSDeCoS, acceleration factors of 6-8 were achieved for 16 in-vivo datasets of both the carotid artery (6 datasets) and the aorta (10 datasets), while decreasing the Normalized Root Mean Square Error by over 10 % compared to a standard iterative reconstruction and by achieving similarity values of over 0.93. Inflow-Outflow phantom experiments showed good parabolic profiles and an excellent mass conservation.	aorta;blast phase;body regions;compressed sensing;conventional pci;data acquisition;experiment;four-dimensional computed tomography;hemodynamics;imaging phantom;iterative method;iterative reconstruction;mean squared error;parabolic antenna;phantoms, imaging;plant roots;rendering (computer graphics);resonance;sparse matrix;video-in video-out;benefit;shear stress	Jana Hutter;Peter Schmitt;Gunhild E.

87ec4127fac425ef77e6dafe375dc468a81ffd8c	a hierarchical 3d segmentation method and the definition of vertebral body coordinate systems for qct of the lumbar spine	lumbar spine;3d segmentation;volume of interest;3d spine segmentation;morphological operation;precision;anatomic coordinate system;bone mineral density;patient monitoring;trueness;soft tissue;deformable model;coordinate system	We have developed a new hierarchical 3D technique to segment the vertebral bodies in order to measure bone mineral density (BMD) with high trueness and precision in volumetric CT datasets. The hierarchical approach starts with a coarse separation of the individual vertebrae, applies a variety of techniques to segment the vertebral bodies with increasing detail and ends with the definition of an anatomic coordinate system for each vertebral body, relative to which up to 41 trabecular and cortical volumes of interest are positioned. In a pre-segmentation step constraints consisting of Boolean combinations of simple geometric shapes are determined that enclose each individual vertebral body. Bound by these constraints viscous deformable models are used to segment the main shape of the vertebral bodies. Volume growing and morphological operations then capture the fine details of the bone-soft tissue interface. In the volumes of interest bone mineral density and content are determined. In addition, in the segmented vertebral bodies geometric parameters such as volume or the length of the main axes of inertia can be measured. Intra- and inter-operator precision errors of the segmentation procedure were analyzed using existing clinical patient datasets. Results for segmented volume, BMD, and coordinate system position were below 2.0%, 0.6%, and 0.7%, respectively. Trueness was analyzed using phantom scans. The bias of the segmented volume was below 4%; for BMD it was below 1.5%. The long-term goal of this work is improved fracture prediction and patient monitoring in the field of osteoporosis. A true 3D segmentation also enables an accurate measurement of geometrical parameters that may augment the clinical value of a pure BMD analysis.

We designed a novel tracking prototype where a 2-D motion sensor was introduced to directly measure the insertion-retreat linear motion and also the rotation of the endoscope. With our developed stochastic optimization method, which embeds traceable particle swarm optimization in the Condensation algorithm, a full six degrees-of-freedom endoscope pose (position and orientation) can be recovered from 2-D motion sensor measurements. Experiments were performed on a dynamic bronchial phantom with maximal simulated respiratory motion around 24.0 mm. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method provides a promising endoscope motion tracking approach with more effective and robust performance than several current available tracking techniques. The average tracking accuracy of the position improved from 6.5 to 3.3 mm, which further approaches the clinical requirement of 2.0 mm in practice.	bronchoscopes;bronchoscopy;capacitor plague;clinical act of insertion;condensation algorithm;embedded system;embedding;endoscope device component;endoscopes;imaging phantom;insertion mutation;mathematical optimization;maximal set;motion detector;navigation;particle swarm optimization;patients;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;prototype;six degrees of separation;smoothing (statistical technique);stochastic optimization;traceability;tracking system;sensor (device)	Xióngbiao Luó;Takayuki Kitasaka;Kensaku Mori	2013	IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging	10.1109/TMI.2013.2263152	stochastic process;computer vision;simulation;pose;computer science;motion estimation;image sensor;mathematics;optics	Robotics	42.52891604162831	-85.82910510693361	72733
bc624058dfcdda2bc9665713ba6ff9fee28346f3	statistical noise analysis in sense parallel mri		A complete first and second order statistical characterization of noise in SENSE reconstructed data is proposed. SENSE acquisitions have usually been modeled as Rician distributed, since the data reconstruction takes place into the spatial domain, where Gaussian noise is assumed. However, this model just holds for the first order statistics and obviates other effects induced by coils correlations and the reconstruction interpolation. Those effects are properly taken into account in this study, in order to fully justify a final SENSE noise model. As a result, some interesting features of the reconstructed image arise: (1) There is a strong correlation between adjacent lines. (2) The resulting distribution is non-stationary and therefore the variance of noise will vary from point to point across the image. Closed equations for the calculation of the variance of noise and the correlation coefficient between lines are proposed. The proposed model is totally compatible with g-factor formulations.	coefficient;interpolation;reconstruction filter;sense;stationary process	Santiago Aja-Fernández;Gonzalo Vegas-Sánchez-Ferrero;Antonio Tristán-Vega	2014	CoRR		gradient noise;gaussian noise;mathematical optimization;value noise;mathematics;statistics	ML	47.525289537666396	-83.35405294768557	72832

To improve the validity of the ECCU method, the effect of the geometry parameter of a typical single-material calibration phantom (water calibration phantom) on the ECCU algorithm was investigated. Dual-material calibration phantoms (such as water-bone calibration phantom), geometry arrangement, and the area-ratio of dual-material calibration phantoms were also studied. Preliminary results implied that, to assure the effectiveness of the ECCU algorithm, the polychromatic projections of calibration phantoms must cover the polychromatic projection data of the scanning object. However, the projection range of a water calibration phantom is limited by the scan field of view (SFOV), thus leading to methodological limitations. A dual-material phantom of a proper size and material can overcome the limitations of a single-material phantom and achieve good correction effects.	algorithm;bone tissue;ct scan;calibration;computer simulation;dual;image quality;imaging phantom;modulation;morphologic artifacts;numerical analysis;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;population parameter;projections and predictions;water cooling;while;algorithm;voltage	Jing Zou;Xiao-Dong Hu;Hanyu Lv;Xiaotang Hu	2013		10.1155/2013/563571	biology;medical research;simulation;computer science;bioinformatics;medical physics	Visualization	47.17372084526612	-83.98331118767318	73212

The method is investigated using data measured by an experimental ultrasound scanner from a flow rig. A commercial 7 MHz linear array transducer is used and data are measured for flow angles of 60/spl deg/ and 90/spl deg/. The velocity magnitude is determined with a precision of 0.36 % (60/spl deg/) and 1.2 % (90/spl deg/), respectively.

It focuses on the peripheral mechanism. It is known that the reflex loops in the peripheral nervous system have influences on the tremor. A neuromusculoskeletal model with several reflex loops is developed to explore the dynamics of tremor. The muscle model is derived from a Hill-type muscle model. The reflex loops include the spindle organ, Golgi tendon organ, and Renshaw cell. Their effects are investigated quantitatively in detail. A two-muscle (agonist/antagonist) system with interaction is further studied. Moreover, a model in combination with the central oscillation and peripheral system is developed.

(innovative treatments of high resolution retina images in the human eye)		The high-resolution retina imaging offers new perspectives for the diagnosis of retinal diseases but new challenges emerge as the spatial and temporal variability of the reflectance of the photoreceptors. In this thesis, we were interested in the variability of imaging cones by adaptive optics field, assuming it was due to the entanglement of two factors: the anisotropy of the photoreceptors (Stiles-Crawford effect) and the temporal variability. Our objective was to analyze the importance of spatial and temporal variability of the reflectance of cones in counting for adaptive optics high resolution imaging, and propose ways to overcome these difficulties. The first part of the work of this thesis focuses on the study of the temporal variability of cones. We confirmed the presence of a scintillation phenomenon (high frequency variability in reflectance) at a frequency at least equal to that of our acquisition system. We have proposed an image analysis process including restoration by deconvolution, rigid registration, and image fusion for cone mapping. To validate this approach, we conducted a validation test for two deconvolution methods. We evaluated the contribution of each of these techniques on the automatic detection of cones in the case of raw images and processed images. The result was that the myopic deconvolution was essential for the analysis of raw images. We have shown that in the case of healthy subjects, the image fusion procedure to bring the measurement of cone density and histological references. The angular variation of cone reflectance is called optical Stiles-Crawford effect. We have identified a new clinical manifestation of this phenomenon, through a study on the analysis of adaptive optics images periphery (current revision). We have shown, through the alternation of the positive / negative mosaics, that the reflectance of the cones may become lower than that of rods. Comparison with the data of the optical coherence tomography showed a strong correlation of the switching with the outer segments layer. We then proposed a procedure of integration of spatial variability for cone mapping. This procedure was evaluated in healthy and diseased subjects and showed a significant gain (in terms of cone enumeration) in pathological cases. As in any image analysis work, the limits of our work mainly concern those of the imaging systems themselves. Indeed, the system that we used do not allow a quantitative measurement of the tissue reflectance, or a precise measurement of the angle of incident light relative to the retina, or an analysis of the scintillation frequency. Due to a lack of time we have not studied the effect of the combination of temporal and angular compensation. Finally, just a small number of incident angles were explored, not allowing a precise measurement of the orientation of the photoreceptors. Our work has focused on the healthy retina. The goal (and real medical purpose) of our approach is, however, to improve the diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of patients with retinal diseases. Despite the limitations of our work, this work will not only allow a better analysis of the density of photoreceptors, but also provide the basis for the analysis of the orientation of the photoreceptors. These findings suggest new avenues for improved medical information that can be obtained from these systems, and therefore must be taken into account by the designers of retinal imaging systems for new generations of imaging systems.

bab465b04747a9f246a667d077da75c734be13cd	automatic selection of best quality vessels from multiple-phase coronary ct angiography (ccta)	coronary arteries;computer aided diagnosis;soft plaque;quality measurement;angiography;registration;vessel quality measure;ct angiography	We are developing an automated method to select the best-quality vessels from coronary arterial trees in multiplephase cCTA and build a best-quality tree to facilitate the detection of stenotic plaques. Using our previously developed vessel registration method, the vessels from different phases were automatically registered. Branching points on the centerline are projected onto the registered trees. The centerlines are split into branches based on the projected branching points. Each tree branch is then straightened. The registered trees and centerline branches are used to determine the correspondence of branches between phases so that each branch can be compared to its corresponding branches in the other phases. A vessel quality measure (VQM) is calculated as the average radial gradients at the vessel wall over the entire vessel branch. The quality of the corresponding branches from all phases is automatically compared using the VQM. An observer preference study was conducted with two radiologists to visually compare the quality of the vessels. For each branch, the pair that was automatically determined to be the best and worst quality by the VQM was used for the radiologists’ visual assessment. Each radiologist, blinded to the VQM, evaluated pairs of corresponding branches and provided their preference. The performance of the automatic selection using VQM was evaluated as the percentage of the total number of vessel pairs for which the automatic selection agreed with the radiologist’s selection of the higher quality branch in the pair. The agreement between the first radiologist and the automated selection was 80% and that between the second radiologist and the automated selection was 82%. In comparison, the agreement between the two radiologists was 90%. This preliminary study demonstrates the feasibility of using an automated method to select the best-quality vessels from multiple cCTA phases. © (2015) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

This formulation is known to be ill-posed, which increases dependence of the EIT on the reconstruction algorithm, which must have a regularization technique to improve the conditioning of the problem. Therefore, this project proposes the use of a Multi-Objective Optimization algorithm in order to find the set of optimal solutions to the problem, aiming to minimize both the Euclidean distance and a regularization parameter.	algorithm;characteristic impedance;cross section (geometry);electromagnetically induced transparency;euclidean distance;finite element method;iterative reconstruction;mathematical optimization;matrix regularization;multi-objective optimization;nominal impedance;optimization problem;simulated annealing;tomography;well-posed problem	Thiago de Castro Martins;Amanda Vieira Fernandes;Marcos de Sales Guerra Tsuzuki	2014	2014 IEEE 11th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)	10.1109/ISBI.2014.6867840	computer vision;mathematical optimization;machine learning;mathematics	Vision	51.90767366750131	-80.68590955911058	74063

More recent developments have made possible 3D localization of the implanted radioactive seeds. This is usually modeled as an assignment problem and solved by resolving the correspondence of seeds. It is, however, NP-hard, and the problem is even harder in practice due to the significant number of hidden seeds. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that can find an optimal solution from multiple projection images with hidden seeds. It solves an equivalent problem with reduced dimensional complexity, thus allowing us to find an optimal solution in polynomial time. Simulation results show the robustness of the algorithm. It was validated on 5 phantom and 18 patient datasets, successfully localizing the seeds with detection rate of > or = 97.6% and reconstruction error of < or = 1.2 mm. This is considered to be clinically excellent performance.	algorithm;assignment problem;brachytherapy;dimensionality reduction;implants;optimal matching;patients;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;plant seeds;radioactivity;radiometry;roentgen rays;seeds (cellular automaton);simulation;time complexity	Junghoon Lee;Christian Labat;Ameet K.

4feb30ef25ffa50df2185d2d2d943f4289215293	adaptive cortical parcellations for source reconstructed eeg/meg connectomes	adaptive parcellation;cross-talk function;functional connectome;meg/eeg;source localisation;whole brain connectivity	Abstract There is growing interest in the rich temporal and spectral properties of the brainu0027s functional connectome that are provided by Electro- and Magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG). However, the problem of leakage between brain sources that arises when reconstructing brain activity from EEG/MEG recordings outside the head makes it difficult to distinguish true connections from spurious connections, even when connections are based on measures that ignore zero-lag dependencies. In particular, standard anatomical parcellations for potential cortical sources tend to over- or under-sample the real spatial resolution of EEG/MEG. By using information from cross-talk functions (CTFs) that objectively describe leakage for a given sensor configuration and distributed source reconstruction method, we introduce methods for optimising the number of parcels while simultaneously minimising the leakage between them. More specifically, we compare two image segmentation algorithms: 1) a split-and-merge (SaM) algorithm based on standard anatomical parcellations and 2) a region growing (RG) algorithm based on all the brain vertices with no prior parcellation. Interestingly, when applied to minimum-norm reconstructions for EEG/MEG configurations from real data, both algorithms yielded approximately 70 parcels despite their different starting points, suggesting that this reflects the resolution limit of this particular sensor configuration and reconstruction method. Importantly, when compared against standard anatomical parcellations, resolution matrices of adaptive parcellations showed notably higher sensitivity and distinguishability of parcels. Furthermore, extensive simulations of realistic networks under various circumstances revealed significant improvements in network reconstruction accuracies, particularly in reducing false leakage-induced connections. Adaptive parcellations therefore allow a more accurate reconstruction of functional EEG/MEG connectomes.	algorithm;arabic numeral 0;connectome;cross reactions;cross-talk;electroencephalography;extravasation;image segmentation;magnetoencephalography;merge;region growing;residential gateway;s-adenosylmethionine;simulation;spectral leakage	Seyedeh-Rezvan Farahibozorg;Richard N.

Analysis of cardiac function provides clinically useful diagnostic and prognostic information; however, manual analysis of function via delineation is prohibitively time consuming. This article describes a technique for analysis of dynamic magnetic resonance images of the left ventricle using a non-rigid registration algorithm. A manually delineated contour of a single phase was propagated through the dynamic sequence.   MATERIALS AND METHODS Short-axis cine magnetic resonance images were resampled into polar coordinates before all the time frames were aligned using a non-rigid registration algorithm. The technique was tested on 10 patient data sets, a total of 1,052 images were analyzed.   RESULTS Results of this approach were investigated and compared with manual delineation at all phases in the cardiac cycle, and with registration performed in a Cartesian coordinate system. The results correlated very well with manually delineated contours.   CONCLUSION A novel approach to the registration and subsequent delineation of cardiac magnetic resonance images has been introduced. For the endocardium, the polar resampling technique correlated well with manual delineation, and better than for images registered without radial resampling in a Cartesian coordinate system. For the epicardium, the difference was not as apparent with both techniques correlating well.	alignment;apache axis;axis vertebra;cardiovascular diseases;cessation of life;cine procedure;endocardium;epicardium;frame (physical object);heart ventricle;left ventricular structure;muscle rigidity;radial (radio);resonance;algorithm;registration - actclass	Nicholas M.

f9b757605e6896a61621b010c9cba7fc291be025	parametric detection and classification of compact conductivity contrasts with electrical impedance tomography		Electrical impedance tomography is a noninvasive and cost-effective imaging method that is increasingly attractive in the field of medical diagnostics. Several health conditions, such as stroke and solid tumors, are characterized by compact conductivity anomalies surrounded by a fairly regular background. Commonly employed voxel-by-voxel reconstruction methods for impedance imaging share the disadvantages of high computational cost and substantial sensitivity to measurement noise and imperfections in the electrical model describing the domain of interest. We present a special purpose algorithm for automatic detection and identification of compact conductivity variations. The technique exploits a priori structural information and, by reconstructing only the limited number of parameters required to describe a compact conductivity contrast, does not depend on a critical regularization parameter. The most demanding kernels are implemented to run on graphics processing units to accelerate computation. The parametric reconstruction is quicker and more robust than widely employed approaches with respect to measurement noise and imperfections in the electrical model, as shown by computational analysis performed on a segmented head domain and experimental measurements acquired on a cylindrical phantom. When the goal is quick detection of compact conductivity contrasts in complex 3-D domains, the inclusion of specific constraints relating to the problem considered leads to enhanced quality of reconstruction, making the presented technique a promising alternative to common voxel-by-voxel reconstruction methods.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;characteristic impedance;computation;computer graphics;discretization;electromagnetically induced transparency;graphics processing unit;nominal impedance;phantom reference;region of interest;tomography;voxel	Andrea Samore;Marco Guermandi;Silvio Placati;Roberto Guerrieri	2017	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2017.2711818	electronic engineering;iterative reconstruction;conductivity;parametric statistics;noise measurement;tomography;imaging phantom;electrical impedance tomography;mathematics;electrical impedance	Vision	50.22357018299511	-81.79897207878548	75011

EIT is a noninvasive imaging modality based on the reconstruction of the conductivity profile inside a solution domain using injected low frequency currents and measuring voltage via electrodes. The forward problem simulates measurement data for comparing with experimental data in the inverse problem. Since the solution of the finite element method depends on the mesh shape and boundary condition constraints are difficult to apply in the mesh free method, the combined wavelet based mesh free method can resolve the disadvantages of these methods in the EIT forward problem. A two dimensional EIT problem is modeled. The simulation results obtained by the combined wavelet based mesh free method are compared with standard finite element method in terms of accuracy and computational cost.	algorithmic efficiency;characteristic impedance;computation;electromagnetically induced transparency;finite element method;meshfree methods;simulation;tomography;wavelet	Mohammad Reza Yousefi;Reza Jafari;Hamid Abrishami Moghaddam	2012	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/MeMeA.2012.6226647	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;calculus;mathematics	Robotics	51.80350273976101	-80.81975716238493	75455

Identifying the residual fluid retained inside the colon is a major challenge for 3D virtual colonoscopy using fecal tagging CT data. Digital bowel cleansing aims to segment the colon lumen from a patient abdominal image acquired using an oral contrast agent for colonic material tagging. After removing the segmented residual fluid, the clean virtual colon model can be constructed and visualized for screening. We present a novel automatic method for digital cleansing using probability map. The random walker algorithm is used to generate the probability map for air (inside the colon), soft tissue, and residual fluid instead of segment colon lumen directly. The probability map is then used to remove residual fluid from the original CT data. The proposed method was tested using VC study data at National Cancer Institute at NIH. The performance of our VC system for polyp detection has been improved by providing radiologists more detail information of the colon wall.	amiga walker;ct scan;colon classification;isosurface;linear equation;random walker algorithm;system of linear equations;tomography;vc dimension;variable shadowing;virtual colonoscopy;voxel	Wei Hong;Feng Qiu	2010		10.1117/12.844281	three-dimensional space;tomography;soft tissue;cancer	Visualization	45.05677652636653	-84.21390016800301	75795

We previously designed and fabricated a tendon driven DCM with a large instrument channel and evenly distributed compliant joints for minimally-invasive skull base surgery and the treatment of osteolysis during hip revision surgery. The evenly distributed compliant joints, in some cases, may limit the reach of the DCM during lesion removal. In this paper, we propose a finite element analysis (FEA) method for optimizing the distribution of the compliant joints based on treatment space requirements determined preoperatively. After performing experiments to validate the FEA results, we investigated the effects of height and cross distance of unevenly distributed compliant joints on tip trajectories and deflection shapes of DCMs. A boundary exploration for skull base surgery was performed to investigate the improvement in the percent of boundary explored by the optimized DCMs with the unevenly distributed compliant joints. Results show the advantage of using DCMs with unevenly distributed joints in reaching the boundary of the lesion. For a typical lesion in the petrous apex during skull base surgery, simulation results indicates that the design of unevenly distributed compliant joints can increase the reach of the DCM accomplishing 71% lesion removal compared with 59% from the DCM with evenly distributed compliant joints.	apex1 protein, human;apache continuum;apex (geometry);articular system;base of skull structure;compliance behavior;continuity of patient care;dicom;experiment;f9 embryonic antigen gene;federal enterprise architecture;fifty nine;finite element analysis;flat ductal epithelial atypia of the breast;lytic lesion;operative surgical procedures;petrous apex;repeat surgery;requirement;simulation;tendon structure;triune continuum paradigm	Anzhu Gao;Ryan J.

7a3a7e291b445f2394ee7520cb3640e128b2c979	multi-contrast unbiased mri atlas of a parkinson’s disease population	susceptibility weighted imaging;multi echo flash;parkinson s disease;unbiased brain atlas;multi contrast	Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second leading neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’s disease. In PD research and its surgical treatment, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS), anatomical structural identification and references for spatial normalization are essential, and human brain atlases/templates are proven highly instrumental. However, two shortcomings affect current templates used for PD. First, many templates are derived from a single healthy subject that is not sufficiently representative of the PD-population anatomy. This may result in suboptimal surgical plans for DBS surgery and biased analysis for morphological studies. Second, commonly used mono-contrast templates lack sufficient image contrast for some subcortical structures (i.e., subthalamic nucleus) and biochemical information (i.e., iron content), a valuable feature in current PD research. We employed a novel T1–T2* fusion MRI that visualizes both cortical and subcortical structures to drive groupwise registration to create co-registered multi-contrast (T1w, T2*w, T1–T2* fusion, phase, and an R2* map) unbiased templates from 15 PD patients, and a high-resolution histology-derived 3D atlas is co-registered. For validation, these templates are compared against the Colin27 template for landmark registration and midbrain nuclei segmentation. While the T1w, T2*w, and T1–T2* fusion templates provide excellent anatomical details for both cortical and subcortical structures, the phase and R2* map contain the biochemical features. By one-way ANOVA tests, our templates significantly ( $$p<0.05$$ p < 0.05 ) outperform the Colin27 template in the registration-based tasks. The proposed unbiased templates are more representative of the population of interest and can benefit both the surgical planning and research of PD.	alzheimer's disease;anatomic structures;atlases;bibliographic reference;brain atlas;cell nucleus;cervical atlas;clinical use template;declaration (computer programming);deep brain stimulation;direct-broadcast satellite;experiment;forty nine;image resolution;midbrain structure;neurodegenerative disorders;nonlinear system;numerous;one-way function;parkinson disease;parkinsonian disorders;patients;pike;revision procedure;structure of subthalamic nucleus;unbiased rendering;biologic segmentation;cell transformation;registration - actclass;shosaiko-to;standards characteristics	Yiming Xiao;Vladimir Fonov;Silvain Bériault;Fahd Al Subaie;M.

57c35a37d612b20ef6fb5d309ac84a770750dcac	quantification of the effects of low dose radiation and its impact on cardiovascular risks	qa mathematics	This work describes an algorithm developed to quantify the effects of low dose radiation on the cardiac endothelial cells with the final objective of inferring how radiation may potentially initiate cardiovascular disease in post radiotherapy-treated patients. The effects are investigated by using an in-vitro co-culture cellular matrix, consisting of endothelial cells on a base of fibroblasts, which in time begin to form capillary (tubular) like structures. A range of radiation doses (0.2-16 Gray (Gy)) was applied to different samples and the effects observed. The automatic segmentation is validated against a set of manual segmented images with satisfactory results presenting a correct classification of 0.93; classification is the measure of comparison between two sets of images, specified as a number from 0 to 1, whereby 1 denotes 100% similarity whilst 0 refers to 0% similarity. Measurements related to geometrical parameters were further obtained. It was found during the course of this project, the largest observable change in endothelial cell structure was found after exposure to 0.2 Grays of radiation.		Atif S.

7be38ba53ce74848599e9a2c51a70020b7e735ae	virtual simulation for scoliosis surgery		Virtual Reality is currently one of the most emerging innovative technologies, and over the last year we have seen how different sectors have successfully applied it ranging from the most industrial sectors to the education or medical sectors. The system presented in this article consists on a virtual simulation of a lumbar transpedicular fixation surgical operation, in order to achieve a fixation of three vertebral functional units. The user will be inside an operating room, in front of the patient, which in this case is a complete 3D model that includes musculature, complete skeleton, ligaments, veins, arteries ... The actions to be performed include selecting the right tool and subsequently its use, so that the user interacts with the system by moving his hands. The objective of this study is for the user to know the tools that should be used in this procedure and the steps that must be followed. In addition, virtual simulation merges with videos of real surgery, making this system a great tool for training in this type of surgery, demonstrating the potential of Virtual Reality as a useful technology for training. This system includes a theoretical part that shows all the steps and all the information to the user, and a practical part, in which you must interact with the system to perform each step of the procedure itself. This interactive virtual simulation has been developed by the company specialized in advanced systems of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality ARSOFT, in collaboration with members of the Research Groups of the University of Salamanca VisualMed Systems.	3d modeling;augmented reality;ccir system a;session fixation;simulation;virtual reality	Santiago González Izard;Juan Antonio Juanes Méndez;Jesús M.

The task is an inverse source problem governed by partial differential equations (PDE). Our main contribution is solving the inverse problem within a PDE-constrained optimization framework that enables various physically-based constraints in both equality and inequality forms. We formulated the optimality conditions rigorously in the continuum before deriving finite element discretization, thereby making the optimization independent of discretization choice. Such a formulation was derived for the L2-norm Tikhonov regularization and the total variation minimization. The subsequent numerical optimization was fulfilled by a primal-dual interior-point method tailored to our problem's specific structure. Our simulations used realistic, fiber-included heart models consisting of up to 18,000 nodes, much finer than any inverse models previously reported. With synthetic ischemia data we localized ischemic regions with roughly a 10% false-negative rate or a 20% false-positive rate under conditions up to 5% input noise. With ischemia data measured from animal experiments, we reconstructed TMPs with roughly 0.9 correlation with the ground truth. While precisely estimating the TMP in general cases remains an open problem, our study shows the feasibility of reconstructing TMP during the ST interval as a means of ischemia localization.	algorithm;artificial cardiac pacemaker;attempt;constrained optimization;discretization;dual;electrocardiography;estimated;experiment;familial partial lipodystrophy, type 2;finite element method;ground truth;interior point method;internationalization and localization;manifold regularization;mathematical optimization;membrane potentials;myocardial ischemia;myocardium;numerical analysis;numerical partial differential equations;sensitivity and specificity;simulation;social inequality;star trek:;synthetic intelligence;tissue fiber;triune continuum paradigm;antineoplaston a10	Dafang Wang;Robert Michael Kirby;Robert S.

The robotic system can compensate for femur movements during bone drilling procedures. Although it may have other applications, the system was thought to be used in hip resurfacing (HR) prosthesis surgery to implant the initial guide tool. The system requires no fiducial markers implanted in the patient, by using only non-invasive ultrasound images. Design/methodology/approach – The femur location in the operating room is obtained by processing ultrasound (USA) and computer tomography (CT) images, obtained, respectively, in the intra-operative and pre-operative scenarios. During surgery, the bone position and orientation is obtained by registration of USA and CT three-dimensional (3D) point clouds, using an optical measurement system and also passive markers attached to the USA probe and to the drill.

86d349042359363527c1da52d54a8083dcf42e98	3d tensor reconstruction in x-ray dark-field tomography		X-ray dark-field imaging is a novel technique which provides complementary information on structural variation and density fluctuation. It allows to obtain object structures at micrometer scale and also contains information on the orientation of these structures. Since it can be acquired by a conventional X-ray imaging system, dark-field imaging has great potential for medical diagnosis. However, fully recovering 3D orientations in dark-field reconstruction still remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose an improved reconstruction method based on the zero-constrained dark-field reconstruction by Bayer et al. and a simplified principle axes transformation. A well-defined phantom containing representative 3D orientations is reconstructed in our experiment. On average, the structure orientations in the reconstructed volume differ from the ground truth by 9%. Within the boundaries of an object, the error drops to 6%. Application of this method in real diagnosis data can be expected in future.	tomography	Shiyang Hu;Christian Riess;Joachim Hornegger;Peter Fischer;Florian Bayer;Thomas Weber;Gisela Anton;Andreas K.

These retro-illumination images of the back surface of the implanted lens are used to monitor the state of patient's vision after cataract operation. A common post-surgical complication is opacification of the posterior eye capsule caused by the growth of epithelial cells across the back surface of the capsule. Interpretation of the PCO images is based on their segmentation into transparent image areas and opaque areas, which are affected by the growth of epithelial cells and can be characterized by the increase in the image local variance. This assumption is valid in majority of cases. However, for different materials used for the implanted lenses it sometimes happens that the epithelial cells grow in a way characterized by low variance. In such a case segmentation gives a relatively big error. We describe an application of an anisotropic diffusion equation in a non-linear pre-processing of PCO images. The algorithm preserves the high-variance areas of PCO images and performs a low-pass filtering of small low- variance features. The algorithm maintains a mean value of the variance and guarantees existence of a stable solution and improves segmentation of the PCO images.© (2000) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging (HARDI) aims at using more complex models, such as a two-tensor model, for estimating two fiber bundles. We propose a new method for creating experimental phantom data of fiber crossings, by mixing the DWI-signals from high FA-regions with different orientation. The properties of these experimental phantoms approach the conditions of real data. These phantoms can thus serve as a 'ground truth' in validating crossing reconstruction algorithms. The angular resolution of a dual tensor model is determined using series of crossings, generated under different angles. An angular resolution of 0.67pi was found in data scanned with a diffusion weighting parameter b = 1000 s/mm2. This resolution did not change significantly in experiments with b = 3000 and 5000 s/mm2, keeping the scanning time constant.	angular resolution (graph drawing);angularjs;diffusion tensor imaging;diffusion weighted imaging;dual;estimated;experiment;folic acid;ground truth;one thousand;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;population parameter;scanning;tissue fiber;voxel;algorithm;square millimeter (qualifier value)	Matthan W.

To attain reasonable SNR levels with high spatial resolution, multiple acquisitions of each slice have to be acquired. These repetitions are then averaged, with the goal of increasing the SNR. However, subject motion during diffusion-sensitizing gradients creates varying phases between repeated acquisitions. When direct complex averaging is performed, these phase offsets can cause unpredictable phase cancellations and local signal drops. Here, we propose a technique that simultaneously corrects phase and performs a non-local means filtering to reduce noise. The success of the proposed technique is demonstrated in vivo at 3T with DWI of the cervical spinal cord.	gradient;noise reduction;non-local means;video-in video-out	Sevgi Gokce Kafali;Tolga Çukur;Emine Ulku Saritas	2016	2016 24th Signal Processing and Communication Application Conference (SIU)	10.1109/SIU.2016.7495989	real-time mri;electronic engineering;geography;analytical chemistry;nuclear magnetic resonance	Vision	45.390726465587726	-82.67637991686894	77245

The inputs are a set of 3D RV surface meshes at different phases of the cardiac cycle, each reconstructed independently from border-delineated MR images. To generate point correspondence, a template mesh is matched to the actual shape of the RV meshes in each of the time phases. This is done via a coarse matching phase and a fine matching phase. In the former, an initial rough matching between the template and the target is achieved using a radial basis function (RBF) morphing process. The feature points on the template and target meshes are automatically identified using a parameterization method. In the latter, a progressive mesh projection process is used to conform the rough estimate to fit the exact shape of the target. In addition, an optimization-based smoothing process is used to achieve superior mesh quality and continuous point motion. Eight healthy volunteers were recruited for MRI scanning and the algorithm was tested on the acquired data. It was observed that the algorithm took an average of approximately 70 seconds to complete. The maximum absolute deviation of the matched model from the original geometry was 0.187mm.	polygon mesh	Yi Su;May-Ling Tan;Soo Kng Teo;Liang Zhong;Ru San Tan	2015		10.1109/CIC.2015.7411020	computer vision;mathematical optimization;mathematics;engineering drawing	Vision	40.11634274056545	-80.66989671011073	77411

Static and dynamic CINE MRI sequences were developed to acquire high-resolution and functional images of quadriceps muscles at rest and during exercise. After muscle segmentation from static images, 2D outlines at specific locations are extracted from the computed 3D mesh and applied to the corresponding dynamic images at rest. These contours are then extended in time and interpolated in space to offer a 4D model of patient's muscle behaviour during exercise. The developed technique can be clinically applied in muscle assessment and evaluation of muscle recovery after surgery. In future work, the developed model will be extended with registered metabolic data acquired with a state-of-the art PET/MRI hybrid device.

This misalignment may lead to reduced function of the limb, early osteoarthritis and chronic pain. An established treatment option is a corrective osteotomy. For complex malunions, a single-cut rotational osteotomy is sometimes preferred in cases of angular deformity in three dimensions. However, planning and performing this type of osteotomy is relatively complex. This report describes a computer-assisted method for 3-D planning and realizing a single-cut rotational osteotomy with a patient-specific cutting guide for orienting the osteotomy and an angled jig for adjusting the rotation angle. The accuracy and reproducibility of the method is evaluated experimentally using plastic bones. In addition, complex rotational deformities are simulated by a computer to investigate the relation between deformity and correction parameters. The computed relation between deformity and correction parameters enables the surgeon to judge the feasibility of a single-cut rotational osteotomy. This appears possible for deformities combining axial misalignment with sufficient axial rotation.

We use Newton-Euler formulation to account for the effect of actuation, friction, tissue interactions, and bevel-tip forces on the needle. The soft tissue deformation is modeled by finite element analysis, whereas the mechanics-based model is used to predict needle deflections due to bevel-tip asymmetry. The proposed needle-tissue model is then experimentally evaluated by comparing the needle deflections for various insertion depths in a tissue phantom with those achieved from simulations.	clinical act of insertion;color gradient;computational human phantom;control system;euler;experiment;feedback;finite element method;friction;insertion mutation;interaction;mathematical model;mechanics;musculoskeletal diseases;needle device;newton;phantoms, imaging;radial (radio);simulation;tip (unix utility);vii;soft tissue	Amir Haddadi;Keyvan Hashtrudi-Zaad	2011	2011 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6091845	structural engineering;robot;dynamics;biomechanics;finite element method;friction;biological engineering;force;deformation;soft tissue;physics;quantum mechanics;mechanical engineering	Robotics	28.422602156029285	-85.18017726745394	78251

Existing methods for the assessment of fluorescein leakage into the human vitreous are based on the qualitative evaluation of fluorescein angiographies (FA) and on volume measurements, as performed by the Fluorotron Master. A new procedure is presented capable of measuring fluorescein leakage into the vitreous while simultaneously imaging the retina. The present methodology computes the fluorescein leakage in a fully automated way, based on the three-dimensional fluorescence distribution in the human eye by using a single data acquisition. The processing includes signal filtering, volume alignment and profile deconvolution. The deconvolved profile obeys the established physical model. Representative cases shown are: a healthy eye; an eye with drusen from a nondiabetic person; a photocoagulated eye; and an eye with nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy. The results are in agreement with previous findings and go a step further by making possible its daily usage in a clinical setup based on currently available instrumentation.	barrier function;blood-retinal barrier;data acquisition;deconvolution;diabetic neuropathies;diabetic retinopathy;drusen;extravasation;fluorescein;fluorescence;gated blood-pool imaging;instrumentation (attribute);instrumentation (computer programming);ophthalmoscopes;preparation;retina;retinal diseases;spectral leakage;angiogram	Rui Bernardes;Jorge Dias;José Cunha-Vaz	2005	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2004.839801	three-dimensional space;computer vision;radiology;medicine;fluorescence;physical model;deconvolution;functional imaging;mathematics;optics;data acquisition;physics	Visualization	43.4225678722423	-85.12773286436898	78363
f2c2332b26e54aeb8adebc811f9755a3da1334cd	contributions to the acquisition of heart rate and photoplethysmography signal using a real-time software		The Heart Rate (HR) is an essential physiological parameter, and it is commonly used to monitor peopleu0027s health and detect heart diseases. In general, the HR measurement techniques require a contact area for sensors positioning, such as the electrocardiogram, the photoplethysmography sensor and the polar belt, which are the gold standard in HR measurement. A non-contact technique using video streaming of a digital camera has been developed and tested comparing its HR results to the gold standard techniques for HR measurements. During the experiments, the robustness and consolidation of the non-contact method were improved to provide excellent results in comparison to the gold standards. This paper presents a real-time software to measure the HR using two different approaches. The first approach is the utilization of the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to separate the signal components. The second explored approach is the utilization of a fixed color channel. The experiments were conducted using two different Region of Interest (ROI) simultaneously: the forehead and the right-hand palm. The experiment results proved that the acquirement of a photoplethysmography signal is possible via camera. The HR results have shown about 99% of similarity in comparison to the gold standard sensors.	real-time transcription	Pedro Henrique de Brito Souza;Israel Machado Brito Souza;Tharcis Pereira Sacramento;Patricia Candida de Matos Lima Martins;Priscila Valverde de Oliveira Vitorino;Gabrielly Craveiro Ramos;Talles Marcelo Goncalves de Andrade Barbosa;Adson Ferreira da Rocha	2018		10.1109/ICHI.2018.00046	digital camera;robustness (computer science);region of interest;independent component analysis;real-time computing;computer science;photoplethysmogram;channel (digital image)	Robotics	25.40475449640562	-89.30230984494517	78425

Since a patient needs to be positioned in a similar manner as in a therapy machine, a portion of the patient is often positioned outside the scan field-of-view (SFOV). Projection truncation problem also occurs frequently in conventional CT scans and causes imaging artifacts that lead to suboptimal image quality. In this paper, we propose a reconstruction algorithm that enables an adequate estimation of the object outside the SFOV. We make use of the fact that the total attenuation of each ideal projection in a parallel sampling geometry remains constant over views. We use the magnitudes and slopes of the projection samples at the location of truncation to estimate water cylinders that can best fit to the projection data outside the SFOV. To improve the robustness of the algorithm, continuity constraints are placed on the fitting parameters. Extensive phantom and patient experiments were conducted to test the robustness and accuracy of the proposed algorithm.	algorithm;ct scan;curve fitting;experiment;image quality;imaging phantom;sampling (signal processing);scott continuity;truncation	Jiang Hsieh;Ed Chao;Jean-Baptiste Thibault;Brian Grekowicz;Amy Horst;Scott M.

A non-rigid B-Spline based registration is performed between CT scans at different respiratory phases. Radiotherapy contours drawn on a reference phase are than propagated to the target phase. We present results from two novel validation methods: a validation study using a 4D anthropomorphic computational phantom, and a patient data analysis comparing auto-rater versus inter-rater variability. For the phantom study, the overlap was greater than 90%, while the diameter variation was 5.1% at exhale and 3.4% at inhale. For the patient dataset, pairwise auto-rater Dice coefficient values exceeded inter-rater values for 9 of 15 structures. Though subject to inaccuracies caused by residual motion artifacts, and manual contouring variations, the reliability of the method suggests it could be soon introduced in the clinical practice.	b-spline;ct scan;computational human phantom;heart rate variability;imaging phantom;inter-rater reliability;phantom reference;software propagation;sørensen–dice coefficient;unit propagation	Marta Peroni;Maria Francesca Spadea;Marco Riboldi;Guido Baroni;George T.

To reduce morbidity and mortality with this new technique, the surgeon must be well-trained and well-prepared. Virtual endoscopy can be beneficial as a tool for training, preoperative planning, and intraoperative support. This paper introduces STEPS, a virtual endoscopy system designed to aid surgeons in getting acquainted with the endoscopic view of the anatomy, the handling of instruments, the transsphenoidal approach, and challenges associated with the procedure. STEPS also assists experienced surgeons in planning a real endoscopic intervention by getting familiar with the individual patient anatomy, identifying landmarks, planning the approach, and deciding upon the ideal target position of the actual surgical activity. The application provides interactive visualization, navigation, and perception aids and the possibility of simulating the procedure, including haptic feedback and simulation of surgical instruments.	acquired immunodeficiency syndrome;anatomic structures;capsule endoscopy;handling (psychology);haptic device component;haptic technology;imagery;instrument - device;interactive visualization;invasive procedure;morbidity - disease rate;patients;pituitary neoplasms;simulation;surgical instruments;virtual endoscopy	André Neubauer;Stefan Wolfsberger;Marie-Thérèse Forster;Lukas Mroz;Rainer Wegenkittl;Katja Bühler	2005	IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics	10.1109/TVCG.2005.70	simulation;computer science;virtual reality;haptic technology;data visualization	Visualization	38.734307523608706	-86.0896271619563	78806

We developed imaging software that will simplify the measurement of carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) on saliency mapping images. Additionally, specialists evaluated the present images and compared them with saliency mapping images. In the present research, we conducted imaging studies of 25 carotid Doppler images obtained by the Department of Cardiology at Fırat University. After implementing fuzzy c-means segmentation and quaternion-based convolution on all Doppler images, we obtained a model that can be analyzed easily by the doctors using a bottom-up saliency model. These methods were applied to 25 carotid Doppler images and then interpreted by specialists. In the present study, we used color-filtering methods to obtain carotid color images. Saliency mapping was performed on the obtained images, and the carotid artery IMT was detected and interpreted on the obtained images from both methods and the raw images are shown in Results. Also these results were investigated by using Mean Square Error (MSE) for the raw IMT images and the method which gives the best performance is the Quaternion Based Saliency Mapping (QBSM). 0,0014 and 0,000191 mm2 MSEs were obtained for artery lumen diameters and plaque diameters in carotid arteries respectively. We found that computer-based image processing methods used on carotid Doppler could aid doctors’ in their decision-making process. We developed software that could ease the process of measuring carotid IMT for cardiologists and help them to evaluate their findings.	arterial system;cardiology discipline;carotid arteries;computer program;convolution;decision making;diameter (qualifier value);graphics software;image processing;interactive machine translation;international medical terminology;mean squared error;medical imaging;otitis media;structure of lumen of body system;thickness (graph theory);top-down and bottom-up design;biologic segmentation	Ugurhan Kutbay;Firat Hardalaç;Mehmet Akbulut;Ünsal Akaslan;Selami Serhatlioglu	2016	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-016-0507-4	computer vision;radiology;multimedia;quaternion	Vision	37.07593629635181	-80.9788512903655	78824

In variational registration, where the Gâteaux derivative of the similarity measure drives the registration, most literature implicitly assumes that Ω remains constant. This assumption is valid if homogeneous Dirichlet or sliding boundary conditions are chosen for the displacement field; however, it is invalid if any other type of boundary conditions are chosen, or if the similarity measure is computed over some masked portion of the overlap region. This article illustrates how these more general situations of different boundary conditions and/or masked regions can be accommodated in variational registration by explicitly accounting for the varying Ω in the Gâteaux derivative of the similarity measure.	calculus of variations;displacement mapping;gâteaux derivative;image registration;similarity measure;variational inequality;variational principle	Nathan D.

Unfortunately, artifacts and speckle make automatic analysis of the 3-D data sets difficult. In this study, we investigated the use of 3-D spatial compounding to improve data quality, and found that precise registration is the key. A correlation-based registration technique was applied to 3-D ultrasound data sets acquired from in vivo examinations of a human gall bladder. We found that the registration technique performed well, and visualisation and segmentation of the compounded data were clearly improved. We also demonstrated that an automatic volume estimate made from the compounded data (13.0 mL) was comparable to a labour-intensive manual estimate (12.5 mL). In comparison, automatic estimates of uncompounded data are less accurate (ranging from 13.5 mL to 16.7 mL). The registration technique also has applications in intra- and interpatient comparative studies.	data quality;estimated;gall;gallbladder;labor (childbirth);morphologic artifacts;scientific visualization;urinary bladder;video-in video-out;biologic segmentation;registration - actclass	Robert Rohling;Andrew H.

Digital dental models can be generated by scanning the surfaces of plaster dental models or dental impressions with a high-resolution laser scanner. During the planning process, one of the essential steps is to reestablish the dental occlusion. Unfortunately, this task is time-consuming and often inaccurate. This paper presents a new approach to automatically and efficiently reestablish dental occlusion. It includes two steps. The first step is to initially position the models based on dental curves and a point matching technique. The second step is to reposition the models to the final desired occlusion based on iterative surface-based minimum distance mapping with collision constraints. With linearization of rotation matrix, the alignment is modeled by solving quadratic programming. The simulation was completed on 12 sets of digital dental models. Two sets of dental models were partially edentulous, and another two sets have first premolar extractions for orthodontic treatment. Two validation methods were applied to the articulated models. The results show that using our method, the dental models can be successfully articulated with a small degree of deviations from the occlusion achieved with the gold-standard method.	align (company);alignment;approximation algorithm;ct scan;dental impression technique;dental models;dental occlusion;extraction;image resolution;iterative method;list of content management frameworks;matching;mathematical optimization;maxilla;optimization problem;quadratic programming;repositioning (procedure);scanner device component;scanning;simulation;x-ray computed tomography;cell surface furrow;collision;cyclophosphamide/fluorouracil/methotrexate protocol;impression (attitude);permanent premolar tooth	Yu-Bing Chang;James J.

We try to improve performance of bronchoscope tracking based on image registration using multiple initial guesses estimated using motion prediction. This method basically tracks a bronchoscopic camera by image registration between real bronchoscopic images and virtual ones derived from CT images taken prior to the bronchoscopic examinations. As an initial guess for image registration, we use multiple starting points to avoid falling into local minima. These initial guesses are computed using the motion prediction results obtained from the Kalman filter's output. We applied the proposed method to nine pairs of X-ray CT images and real bronchoscopic video images. The experimental results showed significant performance in continuous tracking without using any positional sensors.	accidental falls;allocation;bronchi;bronchoscopes;ct scan;connection-oriented ethernet;diagnostic radiologic examination;emoticon;frame (physical object);image registration;kalman filter;maxima and minima;maximum;neoplasms;real-time clock;track (course);registration - actclass;sensor (device)	Kensaku Mori;Daisuke Deguchi;Takayuki Kitasaka;Yasuhito Suenaga;Hirotsugu Takabatake;Masaki Mori;Hiroshi Natori;Calvin R.

In particular, pancreatic cancer surgery can benefit from a manufactured, patient-specific model. Therewith, the complex anatomical structures of and around the pancreas, especially the vessels, can be visualized. Methods: Several CT data sets showing the pancreas / pancreatic cancer were segmented. A special software system was used which allows segmentation of different tissues and export of three dimensional model data. A patient-specific model containing the pancreas, pancreatic cancer, arteries and veins was created for each case using rapid prototyping technologies. Different prototyping techniques were applied to show details and anatomical structures within the pancreas. Results: The patient-specific models of the pancreas / pancreatic cancer allowed better visualization of the three-dimensional anatomical structure as well as the perception of size and relations of dimensions and volume. Additionally, the vessels and the cancer within the pancreas were highlighted. Conclusions: The described procedure of creating patient-specific models of the pancreas promises advantages for pre-and intraoperative planning of pancreatic cancer surgery.	3d modeling;rapid prototyping;software system	Johannes Schwaiger;Markus Kagerer;Mattias F.

However, the success of the treatment strongly depends on the challenging task of choosing the correct size of the prosthesis, for which, up to now, surgeons solely have to rely on their experience. Here, we present a novel machine learning based approach, which might make it possible to predict the size of the prosthesis from pre-operatively acquired ultrasound images. We utilize support vector regression to train a prediction model on three geometric features extracted from the ultrasound data. In order to evaluate the accuracy and robustness of our approach we created a large data base of porcine aortic root geometries in a healthy state and an artificially dilated state. Our results indicate that prediction of correct prosthesis sizes is feasible. Furthermore, they suggest that it is crucial that the training data set faithfully represents the diversity of aortic root geometries.	abattoirs;aortic valve insufficiency;behavior;biological science disciplines;choose (action);database;databases;diameter (qualifier value);echocardiography, transesophageal;experiment;extraction;heart rate variability;institut für dokumentologie und editorik;machine learning;medical ultrasound;patients;plant roots;porcine species;prosthesis implantation;published database;root-finding algorithm;support vector machine;test set;tooth root structure;total peripheral resistance;video-in video-out	Jannis Hagenah;Erik Werrmann;Michael Scharfschwerdt;Floris Ernst;Christoph Metzner	2016	2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591427	kernel;simulation;computer science;engineering;machine learning;predictive modelling;biological engineering;surgery;robustness	DB	31.849421289935748	-83.03453353610013	79591

The computational model was composed of a finite element model for structure and electrical properties, coupled with a nonlinear double-cable axon model to predict nerve excitation for different myelinated fiber sizes. Mathematical modeling suggested that mediolateral lead position may affect chronaxie and rheobase values, as well as predict greater activation of medial dorsal column fibers with increased PW. These modeling results were validated by a companion clinical study. Thus, variable PW programming in SCS appears to have theoretical value, demonstrated by the ability to increase and even ‘steer’ spatial selectivity of dorsal column fiber recruitment. It is concluded that the computational SCS model is a valuable tool to understand basic mechanisms of nerve fiber excitation modulated by stimulation parameters such as PW and electric fields.	auditory recruitment;axon;bone structure of sacrum;bradycardia;chronaxy;computational model;cross section (geometry);diameter (qualifier value);dorsal funiculus;electroconvulsive therapy;excitation;finite element method;large;lateral thinking;mathematical model;mathematics;medial graph;myelin sheath;nerve fibers;neurostimulation procedures of spinal cord tissue;nonlinear system;optical fiber;paresthesia;pulse-width modulation;selectivity (electronic);shift jis;spinal cord stimulator;tissue fiber;width	Dongchul Lee;Brad Hershey;Kerry Bradley;Thomas Yearwood	2011		10.1007/s11517-011-0780-9	computer simulation;neuroscience;engineering;finite element method;mathematics;physics;anatomy;quantum mechanics;surgery;statistics	HCI	26.326589528342627	-84.46895621652715	79633

Under this identification, we give a new definition of image clutter metric by analyzing the research results in the fields of visual psychology and psychophysics. According to the definition, we further put forward a DisSIMilarity (DSIM) based image clutter metric, which can also be taken as a kind of HVS-based signal-to-clutter ratio. The earlier image clutter metrics produced limited success in predicting targeting performance mainly since they did not consider brain cognitive characteristics. We develop a brain cognitive dissimilarity measure (BCDM) as a quantitative estimate of the selection weights which are allocated by brain attentional mechanism to affect visual selection processes. A human vision perceptual dissimilarity measure (VPDM), fully embodying vision perceptual properties, is first established between the target and clutter images, and then we utilize the BCDM between the two images as selection weights to pool the VPDM to be a clutter metric, which can be called DSIM metric. The metric is tested in Search_2 dataset provided by TNO Human Factors Research Institute of Netherlands. Error analysis and correlation tests demonstrate that the DSIM metric makes a more significant improvement than previously proposed metrics in predicting 62 observers' targeting performances including detection probability, false alarm probability and search time.	appendix;binary logarithm;chamaecyparis lawsoniana;clutter;coefficient;color image;color vision defect;diabetes mellitus;exptime;entropy (information theory);heart rate variability;human factors and ergonomics;human visual system model;image editing;imaging system;mbnl1 gene;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;performance;performance prediction;population parameter;psychophysics;silo (dataset);social inequality;titanium;tooth root structure;top-down and bottom-up design;weight;algorithm;cellular targeting;decimeter;log2;observers;recurrent childhood brain stem glioma;vetispiradiene synthase activity	Dejiang Xu;Zelin Shi	2013	IEEE Transactions on Image Processing	10.1109/TIP.2013.2270112	vision;computer vision;image processing;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;mathematics;clutter	Vision	34.37742405001702	-81.84427742174898	80011

This paper presents a solution to this problem. The particular application discussed here is BNCT (Boron Neutron Capture Therapy) which is an idealized form of radiation therapy providing a mechanism to destroy cancer cells with minimal damage to adjacent normal cells. The radiation treatment planning software (BNCT Rtpe) uses NURBS to represent various anatomical surfaces. For the successful working of the Monte Carlo simulation of neutron transport, no two bodies should intersect in this representation. There always exists the possibility that two or more objects intersect. This paper presents a heuristic to isolate any two given interfering bodies (represented as closed B-spline surfaces). It finds a vector, based on the region of intersection, along which one of the surfaces can be moved to minimally isolate it from the other surface. It successfully isolates the two surfaces while preserving the original shapes and relative orientation of the two surfaces. Future work involved truncation of the surfaces midway between the regions of intersection. >	heuristic	Rajeev Chawla;J. Denbigh Starkey;Ray S. Babcock;Daniel E.

c5c46f8b1cd9f90c15a471fa446bcb077d0119bb	probabilistic model-based detection and localization of calibration phantoms in ct images	computed tomography;cardiovascular system;calibration	As medical imaging moves from qualitative assessment to quantitative analysis based on bio-markers, calibration of imaging data becomes critically important. In computed tomography (CT) images values are scaled to Hounsfield units (HU), despite this, the measurements can vary due to differences in machine-level calibration and patient size. One way to ensure proper calibration at the image level is to include a phantom containing objects of known HU values in each scan so that each image can be calibrated individually by the values measured from the phantom regions within the image. This introduces a need to extract phantom measurements from each image. Given a reasonable starting point manually or heuristically, this is a straightforward segmentation problem because the phantom regions are well defined and the values are relatively uniform. However, the problem becomes challenging if the requirement is a fully automated method that is robust across variations of phantoms and that can exclude images without phantoms. In this paper, we describe a probabilistic model-based approach to tackling this problem. We use the constellation model framework first proposed by Burt el al. to represent a phantom as composed of a number of parts and determine the existence and localization of the phantom in a probabilistic sense based on the detection of candidate parts. This model based approach allows us to formally describe variations in phantom design and handle missing parts caused by phantom regions similar to the background. Initial results on 100 CT studies from a longitudinal cardiovascular study are encouraging. © (2013) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

e748d5c6a7395d2a059700c7caeafbc63d429380	registration of breast surface data before and after surgical intervention		Surgery planing of breast cancer interventions is gaining importance among physicians, who recognize value in discussing the possible aesthetic outcomes of surgery with patients. Research is been propelled to create patient-specific breast models, but breast image registration algorithms are still limited, particularly for the purpose of matching pre- and post-surgical data of patient’s breast surfaces. Yet, this is a fundamental task to learn prediction models of breast healing process after surgery. In this paper, a coarse-to-fine registration strategy is proposed to match breast surface data acquired before and after surgery. Methods are evaluated in their ability to register surfaces in an anatomical reliable way, and results suggest proper alignment adequated to be used as input to train deformable models.

Following ablation therapy, a treatment strategy for atrial fibrillation, reverse structural remodeling has been demonstrated with decreases in both left atrial size and pulmonary vein diameters. Most techniques for assessment of pulmonary vein morphology, however, consist of manual measurements made on cross-sectional images or volume renderings, thereby limiting the ability to fully quantify the 3D structure of the veins. In this work, we propose a method to quantify the 3D morphology of the pulmonary veins by computing the cross-sectional area along the entire extent of the vein. A centerline is tracked along the vein and oblique image slices are extracted at each point along the curve. The overall method requires only minimal manual interaction during the data pre-processing steps and is demonstrated on each of the four pulmononary veins in five subjects scanned with CT imaging prior to ablation therapy.	ct scan;cross-sectional data;data pre-processing;mathematical morphology;oblique projection;preprocessor;volume rendering	Maryam E.

b085042bb5e749fa769b26dc9de715eb0f12073c	a quality score for coronary artery tree extraction results		Coronary artery trees (CATs) are often extracted to aid the fully automatic analysis of coronary artery disease on coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) images. Automatically extracted CATs often miss some arteries or include wrong extractions which require manual corrections before performing successive steps. For analyzing a large number of datasets, a manual quality check of the extraction results is time-consuming. This paper presents a method to automatically calculate quality scores for extracted CATs in terms of clinical significance of the extracted arteries and the completeness of the extracted CAT. Both right dominant (RD) and left dominant (LD) anatomical statistical models are generated and exploited in developing the quality score. To automatically determine which model should be used, a dominance type detection method is also designed. Experiments are performed on the automatically extracted and manually refined CATs from 42 datasets to evaluate the proposed quality score. In 39 (92.9%) cases, the proposed method is able to measure the quality of the manually refined CATs with higher scores than the automatically extracted CATs. In a 100-point scale system, the average scores for automatically and manually refined CATs are 82.0 (±15.8) and 88.9 (±5.4) respectively. The proposed quality score will assist the automatic processing of the CAT extractions for large cohorts which contain both RD and LD cases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a general quality score for an extracted CAT is presented.		Qing Cao;Alexander Broersen;Pieter H. Kitslaar;Boudewijn P. F.

A hybrid approach has been specifically designed for low-contrast vascular structure detection. It makes use of a minimum cost path technique with a Fast-Marching front propagation to extract the vessel centerline. A second procedure was applied to refine the position of the path and estimate the local radius along the vessel. This was achieved with an iterative multiscale algorithm based on geometrical moments. Parameter tuning was performed using a dedicated numerical phantom, and then the algorithm was applied to extract the coronary venous system. Results are provided on three MSCT volume sequences acquired for patients selected for a cardiac resynchronization therapy procedure. A visibility study was carried out by a medical expert who labeled venous segments on a set of 18 volumes. A comparison with two other Fast-Marching techniques and a geometrical moment based tracking method is also reported.	anatomic structures;blood vessel tissue;cns disorder;ct scan;cardiac resynchronization therapy;cardiac venous tree;catheterization;cathode ray tube;cerebrovascular disorders;coronary veins;diastole;full table scan;gaussian blur;ion implantation;iterative method;loss function;morphologic artifacts;multidetector computed tomography;myocardium;numerical analysis;patients;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;population parameter;registration;simulation;software propagation;tracer;trees (plant);x-ray computed tomography;algorithm	Marie-Paule Garcia;Jérôme Velut;Dominique Boulmier;Christophe Leclercq;Mireille Garreau;Pascal Haigron;Christine Toumoulin	2013	IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics	10.1109/JBHI.2013.2245420	radiology;medicine;iterative method;medical physics	Visualization	40.64088935891319	-81.64909764445416	80360

Although echocardiography is the most common imaging modality in clinical cardiac examination, it can only provide the cardiac geometry or motion information without cardiac fiber orientations. If the patient's cardiac fiber orientations can be mapped to his/her echocardiography images in clinical examinations, it may provide quantitative measures for diagnosis, personalized modeling, and image-guided cardiac therapies. Therefore, this project addresses the feasibility of mapping personalized cardiac fiber orientations to three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound image volumes. First, the geometry of the heart extracted from the MRI is translated to 3D ultrasound by rigid and deformable registration. Deformation fields between both geometries from MRI and ultrasound are obtained after registration. Three different deformable registration methods were utilized for the MRI-ultrasound registration. Finally, the cardiac fiber orientations imaged by DTI are mapped to ultrasound volumes based on the extracted deformation fields. Moreover, this study also demonstrated the ability to simulate electricity activations during the cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) process. The proposed method has been validated in two rat hearts and three canine hearts. After MRI/ultrasound image registration, the Dice similarity scores were more than 90% and the corresponding target errors were less than 0.25 mm. This proposed approach can provide cardiac fiber orientations to ultrasound images and can have a variety of potential applications in cardiac imaging.

The intraluminal shunt devices may generally include a primary elongate tubular member that is sized and dimensioned to be inserted into the target vessel, such as the right coronary artery. The primary tubular member includes at least one inner lumen which permits blood perfusion through the vessel. At least one secondary tubular member is provided which is in fluid communication with the primary tubular member. The secondary tubular member may be configured for drug or fluid delivery through the primary tubular member and into the vessel in either an anterograde or retrograde direction. Methods of using shunt devices are also described which generally include making an incision in the target vessel, inserting the proximal and distal ends of the primary tubular member into the target vessel via the incision, and selectively delivering the drug or fluid in either an anterograde or retrograde direction through the primary tubular member and into the vessel.

Based on in vivo breast examination, the authors developed an approach to breast diagnostics which employs ultrasound transmission and reflection tomography imaging. The obtained transmission images of ultrasound speed distribution show good correlation of glandular tissue areas with their visualization on MRI images. The results also allow a prediction that the implemented UST device offering fusion of reconstructed images may contribute to achieving a new standard for breast cancer diagnostics through non-invasive, fast and cheap screening tests.	adipose tissue;benign neoplasm;bioethics;breast;contrast media;distortion;duct (organ) structure;fatty acid glycerol esters;imagery;lumped element model;magnetic resonance imaging;malignant neoplasms;mammary gland parenchyma;mammary neoplasms;maxillary left lateral incisor abutment;maximum intensity projection;medical ultrasound;milk allergy;minkowski portal refinement;modal logic;multimodal interaction;nasal sinus;nipples;numerous;oracle fusion architecture;pgrmc1 protein, human;patients;prototype;scanner device component;scanning systems;spots on skin;tomography, emission-computed;tomography, x-ray;ultrasound tomography;video-in video-out;xfig;algorithm;tumor tissue	Krzysztof J.

38fd6e0f53fb3ccb449026ee0b5af2d86e2e145f	shard: spherical harmonic-based robust outlier detection for hardi methods	dw-mri;hardi;outlier;pre-processing;q-ball;robust;spherical harmonics	High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging (HARDI) models are used to capture complex intra-voxel microarchitectures. The magnetic resonance imaging sequences that are sensitized to diffusion are often highly accelerated and prone to motion, physiologic, and imaging artifacts. In diffusion tensor imaging, robust statistical approaches have been shown to greatly reduce these adverse factors without human intervention. Similar approaches would be possible with HARDI methods, but robust versions of each distinct HARDI approach would be necessary. To avoid the computational and pragmatic burdens of creating individual robust HARDI analysis variants, we propose a robust outlier imputation model to mitigate outliers prior to traditional HARDI analysis. This model uses a weighted spherical harmonic fit of diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans to estimate the values which had been corrupted during acquisition to restore them. Briefly, spherical harmonics of 6th order were used to generate basis function which were weighted by diffusion signal for detection of outliers. For validation, a single healthy volunteer was scanned for a single session comprising of two scans one without head movement and the other with deliberate head movement at a b-value of 3000 s/mm2 with 64 diffusion weighted directions with a single b0 (5 averages) per scan. The deliberate motion from the volunteer created natural artifacts in the acquisition of one of the scans. The imputation model shows reduction in root mean squared error of the raw signal intensities and improvement for the HARDI method Q-ball in terms of the Angular Correlation Coefficient. The results reveal that there is quantitative and qualitative improvement. The proposed model can be used as general pre-processing model before implementing any HARDI model in general to restore the artifacts which are created because of the outlier diffusion signal in certain gradient volumes.	anomaly detection;artifact (software development);basis function;coefficient;computation;diffusion tensor imaging;geo-imputation;gradient;head movements;magnetic resonance imaging;mean squared error;microarchitecture;morphologic artifacts;outlier;preprocessor;scanning;statistical imputation;version;voxel;square millimeter (qualifier value)	Vishwesh Nath;Kurt G.

807a618af7e50743eaa94e6c95b4764e0b4de15e	influence of image quality on semi-automatic 3d reconstructions of the lateral skull base for cochlear implantation		Planning a cochlear implantation requires a 3D reconstruction of the risk structures usually from CT images. However, if the data does not fulfill specific image quality requirements, 3D reconstruction methods could fail or give inaccurate results. This study analyzes the correlation of image quality with the accuracy and reproducibility of semi-automatic 3D reconstructions of structures of the lateral skull base. We analyzed CT data from 12 patients where the risk structures of the lateral skull base were segmented by multiple experts using a dedicated semi-automatic tool. The quality of each image was rated by an experienced ENT surgeon with respect to various criteria. We found a correlation of the segmentation quality for some of the structures with the signal-to-noise ratio as well as the resolution of the images. Imaging artifacts influenced the reproducibility but not the accuracy of the reconstruction.	3d reconstruction;ct scan;cochlear implant;image quality;ion implantation;lateral thinking;requirement;semiconductor industry;signal-to-noise ratio	Frank Heckel;Stephan Zidowitz;Thomas Neumuth;Mandy Tittmann;Markus Pirlich;Mathias Hofer	2016			computer vision;image quality;artificial intelligence;anatomy;skull;computer science	Vision	44.9403105078005	-82.539404139014	81354

The orientations and the positions of the gestures are both taken into account and the similarity rate between two gestures is calculated. In our case, the application is in obstetrics and the aim is to evaluate forceps blade placement. The method is based on the curvature analysis of the paths during the gesture. The 3-D position paths are expressed according to their cumulated chord length and the orientation paths in the quaternion unit space. These parameterizations lead to analyze data in space independently to time as requested by physicians. After filtering data in order to minimize sensor noises, the gestures are then compared by calculating the correlation between the position and the orientation curvatures of a novice gesture and an expert one. The results clearly show that novice skills in handling forceps increase in becoming smoother and closer to the reference placement.

We demonstrate that the numerical and statistical properties of unweighted least-squares reconstruction algorithms associated with each imaging model are generally very different. Specifically, some PAT reconstruction algorithms, including many of the iterative algorithms previously explored, do not work directly with the raw measured pressure wavefields, but rather with an integrated data function that is obtained by temporally integrating the photoacoustic wavefield. The integration modifies the statistical distribution of the data, introducing statistical correlations among samples. This change is highly significant for iterative algorithms, many of which explicitly or implicitly seek to minimize a statistical cost function. In this work, we demonstrate that iterative reconstruction by least-squares minimization yields better resolution-noise tradeoffs when working with the raw pressure data than with the integrated data commonly employed. In addition, we demonstrate that the raw-data based approach is less sensitive to certain deterministic errors, such as dc offset errors.	approximation algorithm;assumed;ct scan;description;diagnostic radiologic examination;iteration;iterative method;iterative reconstruction;least squares;loss function;normal statistical distribution;numerical analysis;optimization problem;photoacoustic spectroscopy;photoacoustic imaging;preconditioner;statistical distributions;tomography;tomography, emission-computed;version;cell transformation	Jin Zhang;Mark A.

Its purpose is to produce images of both high resolution and high contrast desirable for image-guided minimally invasive brain surgery. The input data are multiple 2-D multislice inversion recovery MRI scans acquired at orientations with regular angular spacing rotated around a common frequency encoding axis. The output is a 3-D volume of isotropic high resolution. The inversion process resembles a localized projection reconstruction problem. Iterative algorithms for reconstruction are based on the projection onto convex sets (POCS) formalism. Results demonstrate resolution enhancement in simulated phantom studies, and ex vivo and in vivo human brain scans, carried out on clinical scanners. A comparison with previously published SRR methods shows favorable characteristics in the proposed approach.	additive model;algorithm;angularjs;axis vertebra;computational human phantom;excitation;experiment;four-dimensional computed tomography;image resolution;iterative method;magnetic resonance imaging;mental orientation;optic axis of a crystal;pet/ct scan;phantoms, imaging;pixel;projections and predictions;reconstruction conjecture;simpl;scanning;science of neurosurgery;scientific publication;semantics (computer science);super-resolution imaging;synthetic intelligence;tomographic reconstruction;video-in video-out;visual artifact	Richard Z.

The images of moving spatial heart structures can be efficiently acquired using 4D echocardiography. Unfortunately, because of the low quality such images do not allow for precise measurements. To overcome this problem images need to be further processed and moving structures have to be extracted. In this work we present a method for estimating heart motion from the 3D echocardiographic image sequence. On the basis of this method we have developed an application that enables qualitative and quantitative (i.e. volume changes, stroke volume, ejection fraction and cardiac output parameters) description of the heart wall motion. We provide a set of tools for denoising images using the anisotropic diffusion algorithm extended to the fourth dimension and the time averaging method based on non-linear registration efficiently parameterized using the B-spline based Free Form Deformation. We have also developed a non-linear deformable segmentation algorithm for extraction of the inner ventricular surface. The motion of the left ventricle is reconstructed in our approach by recovering deformations ∗Corresponding author: e-mail address: meow@mat.uni.torun.pl Pobrane z czasopisma Annales AIInformatica http://ai.annales.umcs.pl Data: 28/11/2018 08:18:12	algorithm;anisotropic diffusion;b-spline;doppler echocardiography;email;noise reduction;nonlinear system	Michal Chlebiej;Krzysztof S.

State-of-the-art SPECT scanners yield a large number of regional parameters of the left-ventricular myocardium (e.g., blood supply at rest and during stress, wall thickness, and wall thickening during heart contraction) that all need to be assessed by the physician. Today, the individual parameters of this multivariate data set are displayed as stacks of 2D slices, bull's eye plots, or, more recently, surfaces in 3D, which depict the left-ventricular wall. In all these visualizations, the data sets are displayed side-by-side rather than in an integrated manner, such that the multivariate data have to be examined sequentially and need to be fused mentally. This is time consuming and error-prone. In this paper we present an interactive 3D glyph visualization, which enables an effective integrated visualization of the multivariate data. Results from semiotic theory are used to optimize the mapping of different variables to glyph properties. This facilitates an improved perception of important information and thus an accelerated diagnosis. The 3D glyphs are linked to the established 2D views, which permit a more detailed inspection, and to relevant meta-information such as known stenoses of coronary vessels supplying the myocardial region. Our method has demonstrated its potential for clinical routine use in real application scenarios assessed by nuclear physicians.	arteriopathic disease;blood vessel;blue (queue management algorithm);ct scan;class;cognitive dimensions of notations;computer-aided design;coronary artery disease;coronary vessels;coronary angiography;german research centre for artificial intelligence;glyph;image analysis;imagery;irido-corneo-trabecular dysgenesis (disorder);layout engine;myocardial contraction;myocardial ischemia;myocardial perfusion imaging;myocardium;numerous;photons;population parameter;rendering (computer graphics);semiotics;stenosis;structured analysis;thickness (graph theory);tomography, emission-computed;tomography, emission-computed, single-photon;trusted computer system evaluation criteria;volume rendering;voreen;wall of ventricle;z1 (computer);algorithm;angiogram;funding grant	Jennis Meyer-Spradow;Lars Stegger;Christian Döring;Timo Ropinski;Klaus H.

Organ deformations prevent surgical navigators from performing accurate navigation based on preoperative information. We are studying on a method for deforming preoperative organ models so that the models are matched to intraoperative shapes. The method is based on the ICP (iterative closest point) algorithm and modal representation of shape deformation. In this paper, we describe preliminary experiments for rigid parameter estimation in the entire registration process, by using range data and surface model reconstructed from X-ray CT of a liver phantom.

In addition, image reconstruction tools facilitate the collection of patient-specific brain geometry data such as the exact dimensions of the ventricular and subarachnoidal spaces (SAS) as well as the computer-aided reconstruction of the CSF-filled spaces. The solution of the conservation of CSF mass and momentum balances over a finite computational mesh obtained from the MR images predict the patients' CSF flow and pressure field. Advanced image reconstruction tools used in conjunction with first principles of fluid mechanics allow an accurate verification of the CSF flow patters for individual patients. This paper presents a detailed analysis of pulsatile CSF flow and pressure dynamics in a normal and hydrocephalic patient. Experimental CSF flow measurements and computational results of flow and pressure fields in the ventricular system, the SAS and brain parenchyma are presented. The pulsating CSF motion is explored in normal and pathological conditions of communicating hydrocephalus. This paper predicts small transmantle pressure differences between lateral ventricles and SASs (~10 Pa). The transmantle pressure between ventricles and SAS remains small even in the hydrocephalic patient (~30 Pa), but the ICP pulsatility increases by a factor of four. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) results of the predicted CSF flow velocities are in good agreement with Cine MRI measurements. Differences between the predicted and observed CSF flow velocities in the prepontine area point towards complex brain-CSF interactions.

We propose a decoupled deep learning architecture that projects input frames onto the domain of CT renderings, thus allowing offline training from patient-specific CT data. A fully convolutional network architecture is implemented on GPU and tested on a phantom dataset involving 32 video sequences and $$\sim $$ ∼ 60k frames with aligned ground truth and renderings, which is made available as the first public dataset for bronchoscopy navigation. An average estimated depth accuracy of 1.5 mm was obtained, outperforming conventional direct depth estimation from input frames by 60%, and with a computational time of $$\le $$ ≤ 30 ms on modern GPUs. Qualitatively, the estimated depth and renderings closely resemble the ground truth. The proposed method shows a novel architecture to perform real-time monocular depth estimation without losing patient specificity in bronchoscopy. Future work will include integration within SLAM systems and collection of in vivo datasets.	3d reconstruction;alignment;bidirectional reflectance distribution function;bronchoscopy;ct scan;computation;computer vision;conflict (psychology);deep learning;frame (physical object);graphics processing unit;ground truth;imaging phantom;inference;navigation;network architecture;online and offline;patients;peripheral;phantoms, imaging;real-time clock;sensitivity and specificity;silo (dataset);simultaneous localization and mapping;stemming;time complexity;tomography, spiral computed;video-in video-out;standards characteristics	Marco Visentini Scarzanella;Takamasa Sugiura;Toshimitsu Kaneko;Shin-ichiro Koto	2017	International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery	10.1007/s11548-017-1609-2	computer vision	Vision	41.339697179122844	-84.8814167275228	83261
dd8755a6f3a9c5af7c16d871bbbc5f27fb2c7476	template-free estimation of intracranial volume: a preterm birth animal model study		Accurate estimation of intracranial volume (ICV) is key in neuro-imaging-based volumetric studies, since estimation errors directly propagate to the ICV-corrected volumes used in subsequent analyses. ICV estimation through registration to a reference atlas has the advantage of not requiring manually delineated data, and can thus be applied to populations for which labeled data might be inexistent or scarce, e.g., preterm born animal models. However, such method is not robust, since the estimation depends on a single registration. Here we present a groupwise, template-free ICV estimation method that overcomes this limitation. The method quickly aligns pairs of images using linear registration at low resolution, and then computes the most likely ICV values using a Bayesian framework. The algorithm is robust against single registration errors, which are corrected by registrations to other subjects. The algorithm was evaluated on a pilot dataset of rabbit brain MRI (N = 7), in which the estimated ICV was highly correlated (ρ = 0.99) with ground truth values derived from manual delineations. Additional regression and discrimination experiments with human hippocampal volume on a subset of ADNI (N = 150) yielded reduced sample sizes and increased classification accuracy, compared with using a reference atlas.	algorithm;experiment;ground truth;image resolution;population;robustness (computer science)	Juan Eugenio Iglesias;Sebastiano Ferraris;Marc Modat;Willy Gsell;Jan Deprest;Johannes L. van der Merwe;Tom Vercauteren	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-67561-9_1	labeled data;sample size determination;animal model;ground truth;mathematics;obstetrics;artificial intelligence;pattern recognition	Vision	43.243346202303805	-80.49711692092856	83336

Microscopic biological objects viewed through a light microscope generally have ill-defined boundaries in shape and reflectance and often exhibit transparency. In addition, the limited illumination available in the light microscope often makes it difficult to obtain images of sufficiently high contrast. In the approach presented, a new matching algorithm is introduced using intensity gradient information to solve the problem. Shape descriptions are computed by exploiting a number of additional processing steps. Two different classes of shapes are considered, which lead to two distinct approaches for 3-D analysis: solid objects and vascular networks. The first class of objects is described using a visible surface representation, while the second is expressed in terms of a set of space curves. The efficacy of each approach is demonstrated using microscopic-scale solid and microvascular specimens. >		Nak H. Kim;Alan C. Bovik;Shanti J. Aggarwal	1990	IEEE Trans.

851510d5b75279bf2fdfd8d0ef57c0b647317429	a probability approach to the study on uncertainty effects on gamma index evaluations in radiation therapy	uncertainty;statistical distributions;models statistical;algorithms;humans;radiotherapy dosage;radiotherapy intensity modulated;false negative reactions	Two datasets of points of known spatial positions and an associated absorbed dose value are often compared for quality assurance purposes in External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT). Some problems usually arise regarding the pass fail criterion to accept both datasets as close enough for practical purposes. Instances of this kind of comparisons are fluence or dose checks for intensity modulated radiation therapy, modelling of a treatment unit in a treatment planning system, and so forth. The gamma index is a figure of merit that can be obtained from both datasets; it is widely used, as well as other indices, as part of a comparison procedure. However, it is recognized that false negatives may take place (there are acceptable cases where a certain number of points do not pass the test) due in part to computation and experimental uncertainty. This work utilizes mathematical methods to analyse comparisons, so that uncertainty can be taken into account. Therefore, false rejections due to uncertainty do not take place and there is no need to expand tolerances to take uncertainty into account. The methods provided are based on the rules of uncertainty propagation and help obtain rigorous pass/fail criteria, based on experimental information.	chamaecyparis lawsoniana;computation;evaluation;external beam radiation therapy;fail-safe;false precision;gamma correction;mathematics;modulation;occur (action);propagation of uncertainty;rule (guideline);software propagation	Francisco Cutanda Henríquez;Silvia Vargas Castrillón	2011		10.1155/2011/861869	probability distribution;econometrics;mathematical optimization;uncertainty;mathematics;statistics	NLP	36.16042726382912	-80.96393399345195	83658

For the implementation of the color set back-projection algorithm, the image is transformed from RGB color space to HSV color space and quantized at 166 colors. At the end of this process, the color set of the image is obtained and used in color region detection. The software was tested on a gastroenterologic imagistic database that included 202 patients with peptic ulcer disease. One endoscopic image was taken at inclusion and another two at visit 1 and 2 for each patient, in order to evaluate the cicatrisation process under treatment. It was compared the percentage of correct diagnosis attended by using the classic observational method with the results obtained with the computer-based one in terms of reliability and reproducibility of this method. There were evaluated the advantages of using a computer-based retrieval system in terms of reducing the time spent on this operation. The inter-observer disagreement between human observer and the computer software was significantly low and the speed of the computerized method was higher, proving benefits in terms of time and cost efficiency.	algorithm;color space;cost efficiency;database;quantization (signal processing)	Liana Stanescu;Dumitru Dan Burdescu;Anca Loredana Ion	2006	2006 International Conference on Information Technology: Research and Education	10.1109/ITRE.2006.381548	computer vision;medicine;pathology;information retrieval	Robotics	35.838069730823065	-81.02598922696652	83697

In this paper, six straight-tube nozzles are characterized by photographs of cryogenic spray shapes, as well as measurements of average droplet diameter, velocity, and temperature. A single-droplet evaporation model to predict average spray droplet diameter and temperature is tested using the experimental data presented here. The results show two distinct spray patterns-sprays for 1.4-mm-diameter nozzles ( wide nozzles) show significantly larger average droplet diameters and higher temperatures as a function of distance from the nozzle compared with those for 0.5-0.8-mm-diameter nozzles (narrow nozzles). These results complement and support previously reported studies, indicating that wide nozzles induce more efficient heat extraction than the narrow nozzles.	complement system proteins;computer cooling;cool - action;dermatologic surgical procedures;diameter (qualifier value);large;laser surgery;nozzle device component;spray dosage form;velocity (software development);evaporation;photograph	Guillermo Aguilar;Boris Majaron;Emil Karapetian;Enrique J.

c472770bded6dfadc074404655eae1cdb0dbf079	cromqs: an infinitesimal successive refinement lossy compressor for the quality scores	genomics;rate distortion;decoding;sequential analysis;distortion;bioinformatics	Massive amounts of sequencing data are being generated thanks to advances in sequencing technology and a dramatic drop in the sequencing cost. Much of the data are comprised of nucleotides and the corresponding quality scores that indicate their reliability. The latter are more difficult to compress and are themselves noisy. As a result, lossy compression of the quality scores has recently been proposed to alleviate the storage costs. Further, it has been shown that lossy compression, at some specific rates, can achieve a performance on variant calling similar to that achieved with the lossless compressed data. We propose CROMqs, a new lossy compressor for the quality scores with the property of “infinitesimal successive refinability”. This property allows the decoder to decompress the data iteratively without the need of agreeing with the encoder on a specific rate prior to compression. This characteristic is particularly amenable in practice, as in most cases the appropriate rate at which the lossy compressor should operate can not be established prior to compression. Further, this property can be of interest in scenarios involving streaming of genomic data. CROMqs is the first infinitesimal successive refinement lossy compressor for the quality scores in the literature, and we show that it obtains a comparable rate-distortion performance to previously proposed algorithms. Moreover, we also show that CROMqs achieves a comparable performance on variant calling to that of the lossless compressed data.	biopolymer sequencing;compresses (device);data compression;decoder device component;distortion;encoder device component;lossless compression;lossy compression;nucleotides;refinement (computing);algorithm	Idoia Ochoa;Albert No;Mikel Hernaez;Tsachy Weissman	2016	2016 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)	10.1109/ITW.2016.7606808	data compression;lossy compression;computer science;theoretical computer science;data mining;lossless compression;engineering drawing	Metrics	34.185043684311225	-93.088432671432	84374

The proposed hybrid method consists of a customized fast-marching level-set method for detection of an optimal initial liver region from multiple seed points selected by the user and a threshold-based level-set method for extraction of the actual liver region based on the initial liver region. The performance of the hybrid method was compared with those of the 2D region growing method implemented in OsiriX using abdominal CT datasets of 15 patients. The hybrid method showed a significantly higher accuracy in liver extraction (similarity index, SI=97.6 ± 0.5%; false positive error, FPE = 2.2 ± 0.7%; false negative error, FNE=2.5 ± 0.8%; average symmetric surface distance, ASD=1.4 ± 0.5mm) than the 2D (SI=94.0 ± 1.9%; FPE = 5.3 ± 1.1%; FNE=6.5 ± 3.7%; ASD=6.7 ± 3.8mm) region growing method. The total liver extraction time per CT dataset of the hybrid method (77 ± 10 s) is significantly less than the 2D region growing method (575 ± 136 s). The interaction time per CT dataset between the user and a computer of the hybrid method (28 ± 4 s) is significantly shorter than the 2D region growing method (484 ± 126 s). The proposed hybrid method was found preferred for liver segmentation in preoperative virtual liver surgery planning.	ct scan;customize;format-preserving encryption;less than;liver diseases;osirix;patients;region growing;seed;semiconductor industry;silo (dataset);x-ray computed tomography;biologic segmentation	Xiaopeng Yang;Hee Chul Yu;Younggeun Choi;Wonsup Lee;Baojian Wang;Jaedo Yang;Hongpil Hwang;Ji Hyun Kim;Jisoo Song;Baik Hwan Cho;Heecheon You	2014	Computer methods and programs in biomedicine	10.1016/j.cmpb.2013.08.019	computer vision;medicine;pathology;computer science;level set method;surgery	Visualization	39.540336378785824	-80.54475888279548	84467

Two independent sets of orthogonally oriented projection data are obtained, respectively, from a hand phantom and from frozen breast tissues. Both objects are enclosed within radiolucent containers containing multiple fiducial reference objects. The latter facilitates registration of multiple projections produced by incrementally moving the x-ray source relative to the object about a single axis through a fixed series of angles. These data encompass maximum angular disparities up to 90 deg for each projection series. The resulting data are projectively transformed and nonlinearly processed using tuned-aperture computed tomography to yield a number of contiguous slices equal to the linear resolution of the sampled projections measured in pixels. The resulting slice data are then corrected for differential magnification, appropriately rotated, and linearly merged to yield a relatively complete, volumetrically isotropic representation of the phantom that could be visualized from any desired angle with negligible apparent tomosynthetic distortion. The resulting displays are evaluated subjectively and compared quantitatively with control images produced from optimum projection geometries. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that volume anisotropy intrinsic to tomosynthetic reconstructions can be minimized through integration of contiguously sampled orthogonal projections.	tomography	Richard L.

4c02e5e6a6653c267ca397ca1dd1634c660e977b	registration stability of physical templates in hip surgery		We tested the registration stability of individualized templates in a consecutive study with 80 patients undergoing hip-resurfacing surgery. These templates physically encode registration and navigation parameters but do not require a computer during the actual surgery. The surgical target was the placement of the femoral guidance pin during hip resurfacing, which is a difficult and highly variable task using conventional instruments. The drill trajectory for the guidance pin of the femoral component was planned on a 3D computer model of the femur derived from a preoperative computed tomography (CT) scan. A surface-matched drilling template was designed to perform mechanical registration on the bone surface and had a hole for the drill guide; the template was created using a rapid prototyping machine. Intraoperatively, the individualized template was positioned on the patient anatomy and the pin was drilled into the femoral neck. The final achieved pin orientation and position were measured using an optoelectronic CT-based navigation system. The measured mean deviation between planned and actual central pin alignment of 0.05° in valgus and 2.8° in anteversion shows that the proposed individualized templates for hip resurfacing have reliable registration.	anatomic structures;bone structure of ischium;ct scan;clinical use template;computer simulation;encode;hip structure;instrument - device;numerical weather prediction;patients;rapid prototyping;structure of neck of femur;surface of bone;x-ray computed tomography;registration - actclass	Manuela Kunz;John F.

Continuous DSA images (projections), obtained by X-ray fluoroscopy with contrast-media, are normally used as road maps in vessel catheterization. A more efficient technique would consist in the use of a 3D model reconstruction of the vascular tree, instead of continuous X-ray scans, as a map. By separating vessel information from the undesired background (noise and signals coming from other organs and motion artefacts), efficient segmentation can play a key role in reducing the number of projections (X-ray scans) necessary to reconstruct a 3D vascular model. In what follows, the proposed method is described and some experimental results are reported, thus illustrating the behaviour of the algorithm when compared to other segmentation methods, ideated for the same application. The automatic calculation methods for the parameters used are also reported and discussed.	algorithm	Danilo Franchi;Pasquale Gallo;Giuseppe Placidi	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-89646-3_60	computer vision;computer science;scale-space segmentation	Vision	40.32540814619445	-80.79166073993952	85038

Three-dimensional ultrasound (3D US) techniques were developed to noninvasively monitor the progression of carotid artery disease in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Three-dimensional carotid US images were acquired and reconstructed, and methods for quantitative assessment were developed. The measurement of intima-media thickness (IMT) based on two-dimensional ultrasound (2D US) images was extended to a 3D vessel-wall-plus- plaque thickness (VWT), obtained by computing the distance between the carotid wall and lumen surfaces on a point-by-point basis. VWT measurements were superimposed on the arterial wall to produce 3D VWT maps. VWT changes were determined by comparing the 3D VWT maps obtained at two different time points. To facilitate the visualization and interpretation of the VWT and VWT-Change maps, a technique to flatten these maps was developed. Carotid remodeling involving changes in both arterial wall and plaque thickness was assessed with VWT maps obtained from in vivo 3D ultrasound images. 3D carotid ultrasound image evaluation with VWT mapping provides a feasible means for the analysis of plaque burden volumes and changes.	color gradient;interactive machine translation;map;thickness (graph theory);video-in video-out	Bernard Chiu;Micaela Egger;J.

To optimize the design of the PVAD for the target patient population, three-dimensional anatomical compatibility studies must be conducted. The aim of this project was to evaluate the utility of three dimensional reconstructions to obviate fit studies in human subjects. Serial CT scans of the thorax of one child were obtained as part of routine treatment. The images were enhanced by adjusting the contrast of the images and segmented semi-automatically prior to 3-D reconstruction. The results were visualized as surface renderings of the rib cage and heart. This data was then amended with solid models of the implantable hardware, including the PVAD and cannulae. Manipulation of the relative orientation of the components revealed surgical challenges that may be anticipated and motivated design modifications to improve the anatomic compatibility. Unique challenges associated with these data sets include the availability of pediatric CT images and difficulty of segmentation due to the small scale of the anatomic features as compared to the resolution of the images.

Boundary conditions are a critical input to the algorithm and are often determined by time-consuming point correspondence methods requiring manual user input. This study presents a novel method of automatically generating boundary conditions by nonrigidly registering two image sets with a demons diffusion-based registration algorithm. The use of this method was successfully performed in silico using magnetic resonance and X-ray-computed tomography image data with known boundary conditions. These preliminary results produced boundary conditions with an accuracy of up to 80% compared to the known conditions. Demons-based boundary conditions were utilized within a 3-D MIE reconstruction to determine an elasticity contrast ratio between tumor and normal tissue. Two phantom experiments were then conducted to further test the accuracy of the demons boundary conditions and the MIE reconstruction arising from the use of these conditions. Preliminary results show a reasonable characterization of the material properties on this first attempt and a significant improvement in the automation level and viability of the method.		Thomas S.

In order to characterize the influence of chamber geometry on ventricular coupling, the ventricles and septum are modeled as portions of ellipsoidal shells, and configuration is derived as a function of pressure gradients by combining shell element equilibrium equations through static boundary conditions applied at the sulcus. Diastolic volume (v) surfaces are calculated as a function of pressure (p), contralateral pressure (clp) and intrathoracic pressure (p t ) and match literature data where available. Ventricular interaction is characterized in terms of partial derivatives in v–p–clp–p t space both under physiological and altered (selectively stiffened walls) conditions. The model allows prediction of diastolic ventricular v–p–clp–p t interplay in a variety of physiopathological circumstances.	cardiac chamber structure;cell septum;coefficient;diastole;emoticon;equilibrium;finite volume method;gradient;groove;heart ventricle;intracranial hypertension;material description;point of view (computer hardware company);right heart strain;tire-pressure monitoring system;ventricular remodeling;walls of a building;heart function	Nicola Toschi;Maria Guerrisi	2008	Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing	10.1007/s11517-008-0324-0	structural engineering;boundary value problem;engineering;geometry;thermodynamics;engineering drawing;physics;pressure gradient	Robotics	28.96105230592368	-85.51634517763317	85582

One of the ways to detect the presence of fusiform aneurysm is by performing computer tomography scan of the body. In this study, actual output of the CT-Scan was converted to 3D model in numerical modeling. The objective of this work is to study the effect of hypertensive blood pressure and the wall shear stress (WSS) since hypertension is reported to be a risk factor in rupture of fusiform aneurysms. The numerical prediction shows that the transient behavior of the interaction under hypertensive blood pressure is significantly different from that under normal blood pressure. The peak wall stress, peak WSS and peak deformation occur shortly after systolic peak pressure. The location of maximum WSS is not where the pressure is the highest but rather where the pressure gradient is the largest.	aaa (video game industry);ct scan;chinese wall;computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis;gradient;numerical analysis;steam rupture;the wall street journal	S.

9efd4ff43c956d0b7a79992427e9e2640c84fee3	mr to x-ray projection image synthesis		Hybrid imaging promises large potential in medical imaging applications. To fully utilize the possibilities of corresponding information from different modalities, the information must be transferable between the domains. In radiation therapy planning, existing methods make use of reconstructed 3D magnetic resonance imaging data to synthesize corresponding Xray attenuation maps. In contrast, for fluoroscopic procedures only line integral data, i.e., 2D projection images, are present. The question arises which approaches could potentially be used for this MR to X-ray projection image-to-image translation. We examine three network architectures and two loss-functions regarding their suitability as generator networks for this task. All generators proved to yield suitable results for this task. A cascaded refinement network paired with a perceptual-loss function achieved the best qualitative results in our evaluation. The perceptual-loss showed to be able to preserve most of the high-frequency details in the projection images and, thus, is recommended for the underlying task and similar problems.

This system provides quantitative gait pattern information for clinicians to evaluate the rehabilitation progress of the patients who had undertaken total knee replacement (TKR) and/or total hip replacement (THR) surgeries. The symmetry between left leg and right leg is a very useful feature for this evaluation purpose. To calculate this parameter, we introduced a new curve feature to describe the gait pattern. This curve feature serves as people’s walking signature. The symmetry is denoted by dynamic time warping (DTW) distance of this walking signature.

Although the case of translational in-plane motion (x-y-motion) has been studied by several researchers, the effect of rigid, translational out-of-plane motion (z-motion) has not yet been completely analyzed due to its more complex nature. Out-of-plane motion introduces blurring along the slice-selection direction in addition to motion artifacts. Here, the authors present a model to represent the effect of out-of-plane motion on multislice MR data. The inversion of this model not only results in the correction of the artifacts due to out-of-plane motion, but also reduces blurring in the slice-selection direction, yielding higher resolution images. Because of the shift-varying nature of the authors' model, they propose to use a nonlinear postprocessing method, projection onto convex sets (POCS), for its inversion, provided that the motion kernel and the slice-selection profile are known. The proposed method has been tested on simulated data and then applied to actual MR data to demonstrate the feasibility of the technique in real imaging situations.	blurred vision;convex set;elegant degradation;genetic translation process;image quality;image resolution;magnetic resonance imaging;morphologic artifacts;motion compensation;muscle rigidity;nonlinear system;projection defense mechanism;spin echo	Jonathan K.

At present, the majority of neuron reconstructions are obtained from preparations in a single tissue slice in vitro, thus suffering from cut off dendrites and, more dramatically, cut off axons. In general, axons can innervate volumes of several cubic millimeters and may reach path lengths of tens of centimeters. Thus, their complete reconstruction requires in vivo labeling, histological sectioning and imaging of large fields of view. Unfortunately, anisotropic background conditions across such large tissue volumes, as well as faintly labeled thin neurites, result in incomplete or erroneous automated tracings and even lead experts to make annotation errors during manual reconstructions. Consequently, tracing reliability renders the major bottleneck for reconstructing complete 3D neuron morphologies. Here, we present a novel set of tools, integrated into a software environment named ‘Filament Editor’, for creating reliable neuron tracings from sparsely labeled in vivo datasets. The Filament Editor allows for simultaneous visualization of complex neuronal tracings and image data in a 3D viewer, proof-editing of neuronal tracings, alignment and interconnection across sections, and morphometric analysis in relation to 3D anatomical reference structures. We illustrate the functionality of the Filament Editor on the example of in vivo labeled axons and demonstrate that for the exemplary dataset the final tracing results after proof-editing are independent of the expertise of the human operator.	alignment;axon;cubic function;cytoskeletal filaments;dendrites;imagery;interconnection;mathematical morphology;morphometrics;name;neurites;neuron;rendering (computer graphics);sectioning technique;silo (dataset);stereoscopy;tracer;transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation;video-in video-out;centimeter;millimeter	Vincent J.

e41a9921db04c2ca1b9a561a82fdb1f8c605e064	slice-to-volume medical image registration: a survey		During the last decades, the research community of medical imaging has witnessed continuous advances in image registration methods, which pushed the limits of the state-of-the-art and enabled the development of novel medical procedures. A particular type of image registration problem, known as slice-to-volume registration, played a fundamental role in areas like image guided surgeries and volumetric image reconstruction. However, to date, and despite the extensive literature available on this topic, no survey has been written to discuss this challenging problem. This paper introduces the first comprehensive survey of the literature about slice-to-volume registration, presenting a categorical study of the algorithms according to an ad-hoc taxonomy and analyzing advantages and disadvantages of every category. We draw some general conclusions from this analysis and present our perspectives on the future of the field.	algorithm;hoc (programming language);image registration;iterative reconstruction;medical image;medical imaging;operative surgical procedures;taxonomy;volumetric display;registration - actclass	Enzo Ferrante;Nikos Paragios	2017	Medical image analysis	10.1016/j.media.2017.04.010	computer vision;simulation;medicine	Vision	36.223523591697244	-86.28568127679087	86256
43c9a6fe6578847b85d183985ecd963e4a8d0770	nonlinear model on pulsatile flow of blood through a porous bifurcated arterial stenosis in the presence of magnetic field and periodic body acceleration	power law index;darcy number;consistency;plug core radius;stenosis;hartmann number	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Background and Objective: The motivation of cardiovascular modeling is to understand the haemodynamic and mechanical factors in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Several investigations have been carried out by many authors to understand the flow properties of blood in modelling blood flows in the circulatory system. In the present article, the pulsatile flow of Herschel-Bulkley fluid through a bifurcated arterial stenosis in a porous medium with magnetic field and periodic body acceleration has been investigated in view of understanding the role of rheological behaviour of blood, stenotic height, bifurcation angle, magnetic field and porosity of wall in the initiation and proliferation of cardiovascular diseases.   METHODS The governing equations involving shear stress are solved numerically using finite difference schemes and the shear stress values in parent and daughter arteries are obtained using MATLAB software. The constitutive equation of Herschel-Bulkley fluid is highly nonlinear and using the equation, velocity distribution has been obtained. From the obtained velocity distribution, the numerical solutions of wall shear stress and flow resistance are found.   RESULTS The plug core radius is, for the first time, computed for various stenotic heights and it is found that the magnetic field and porosity increase the plug core radius. The wall shear stress and flow resistance increase as stenotic height, yield stress, power law index, consistency and Hartmann number increase and decrease with increase in Darcy number and half of the bifurcation angle. It is significant to note that when the value of yield stress is increased from 0.1 to 0.2, the plug core radius is increased by 7.3%. In the presence of yield stress in blood, the applied magnetic field causes 33.87% increase in the plug core radius.   CONCLUSION The mathematical model clearly shows that the increase in wall shear stress affects the aggregation of human platelets and rearranging the alignment of endothelial cells near the arterial wall. This implies that the wall shear stress is to be brought down below its critical level by increasing the values of Darcy number and half of the bifurcation angle. Further, the nature of increased flow resistance reduces the amount of blood supply to the vital organs which ultimately leads to a sudden death. This information is useful for bio-medical engineering in developing bio-medical instruments for a great potential treatment modalities inturn, prevent the causes of stroke, heart attack and renal failure.	alignment;bifurcation theory;blood platelets;bone structure of radius;british informatics olympiad;cns disorder;cardiovascular diseases;cerebrovascular accident;endothelial cells;finite difference method;flow;hemodynamics;herschel graph;instrument - device;kind of quantity - consistency;matlab;magnetic fields;magnetic resonance imaging;mathematical model;mathematics;myocardial infarction;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;obstructive ureterocele;organ;pipelines;plug (physical object);renal insufficiency;star height;stenosis;sudden death;velocity (software development);shear stress	R.

5eb478f5488a44a2dfe70d09ba92f46572c17114	a method for rapid measurement of contrast sensitivity on mobile touch-screens		Touch-screen displays in cell phones and tablet computers are now pervasive, making them an attractive option for vision testing outside of the laboratory or clinic. Here we describe a novel method in which subjects use a finger swipe to indicate the transition from visible to invisible on a grating which is swept in both contrast and frequency. Because a single image can be swiped in about a second, it is practical to use a series of images to zoom in on particular ranges of contrast or frequency, both to increase the accuracy of the measurements and to obtain an estimate of the reliability of the subject. Sensitivities to chromatic and spatio-temporal modulations are easily measured using the same method. A prototype has been developed for Apple Computer’s iPad/iPod/iPhone family of devices, implemented using an open-source scripting environment known as QuIP (QUick Image Processing, http://hsi.arc.nasa.gov/groups/scanpath/research.php). Preliminary data show good agreement with estimates obtained from traditional psychophysical methods as well as newer rapid estimation techniques. Issues relating to device calibration are also discussed. Introduction Reports of vision impairment following long-duration space flight have been hypothesized to be due to elevated intracranial pressure, resulting from fluid shifts in response to microgravity; Vision Impairment and Intracranial Pressure (VIIP) is now a topic of active research [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. This work was motivated by the idea that a method for performing a quick assessment of vision in a minute or two could enable weekly or even daily monitoring of astronaut vision. Mobile devices such as Apple Computer’s iPod Touch have the additional desirable feature of low mass. Simple, portable tools for vision assessment may also have clinical applications on earth. While Snellen acuity is still the most common clinical description of a person’s vision (e.g., ”20/20”), contrast sensitivity is a richer and more informative descriptor. The contrast sensitivity function (CSF) describes the sensitivity to sinusoidal grating stimuli, where ”sensitivity” is defined as the reciprocal of the threshold contrast [8]. Acuity measured with full-contrast letters is roughly equivalent to specifying the high-frequency cut-off of the CSF: both answer the question of what is the smallest thing that can be seen when presented at high contrast. Different ocular pathologies affect the CSF in different ways. A focus error will manifest primarily as a degradation at high frequencies, while a cataract produces a loss of sensitivity at all frequencies. Traditionally, the measurement of contrast sensitivity has been a somewhat laborious task, requiring presentation of multiple stimuli above and below threshold at each frequency of interest. A number of charts designed for clinical use have been developed to provide a fast and easy method to estimate contrast sensitivity in a clinical setting [9, 10]. More recently, the ”Quick CSF” method has been introduced to allow estimation of the form of the CSF as a whole, without time-consuming measurement of the sensitivity at individual frequencies [11, 12]. The Uppsala Contrast Sensitivity Test (UCST) also provides a characterization of contrast sensitivity in 10-20 seconds [13]. The image shown in figure 1 shows an image designed to allow a person to visualize their own CSF. The image is a sinusoidal grating that is swept in frequency in one dimension, while a linear variation of contrast is applied in the orthogonal dimension. The bars corresponding to frequencies of high sensitivity (usually around 1 cycle per degree) will appear to extend further than those corresponding to frequencies of low sensitivity. Thus the region where visible stripes are seen is bounded by the CSF. The contrast/frequency sweep image is the basis of the proposed method. Such an image is presented on a touch screen, and the subject is instructed to swipe their finger along the boundary between the regions containing visible and invisible pattern. It is an easy task which requires little training; the primary problem arises when subjects agonize over what to do, ”over-thinking” the task. The sweep image was first produced in 1964 by Fergus Campbell and John Robson, who made a photographic time exposure of an oscilloscope screen [14]. It was first shown to the public later that year at a meeting of the Optical Society of America, in Washington DC, where a small number of photographic prints were provided. A version of the image subsequently appeared in Floyd Ratliff’s 1965 book [15]. It also appears in Cornsweet’s 1970 book [16], attributed to an unpublished photograph provided by Fergus Campbell. A similar image appears in the optics literature considerably earlier [17], but these authors make no mention of the visual appearance of the pattern, perhaps because for testing lenses the test pattern was fabricated at a fine scale outside the range of normal unaided vision. Campbell and Robson had the idea to have a subject mark the boundary of visibility,but concluded “that for several reasons this was not at all a satisfactory procedure” [18]. These reasons include the dependence of the percept upon where the subject is looking, and movements of the eyes; the presence of the boundary line (if drawn) can also affect the percept [14]. A slightly different procedure involving a sweep of contrast only was introduced by Arden [19], but, according to Robson, the technique “was unable to provide sufficiently reliable measurements” [18].

The surface model of MTAC in STL format was imported into ANSYS ICEM CFD12.1 to generate volume mesh.A finite element model suitable for hemodynamics analysis of patient-specific MTAC was established.Numerical simulation of hemodynamics in this model was performed by means of Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) using ANSYS CFX12.1. The temporal distributions of homodynamic variables such as streamlines, wall pressure, velocity vector and wall shear stress in the arteries were analyzed during a cardiac cycle. The maximum and the average of pressure gradient in a cardiac cycle through a MTAC are 13 mmHg and 2.84 mmHg respectively. The pressure difference between the systolic and the diastolic in a cardiac cycle proximal to the coarctation is about 38 mmHg, which is smaller than the difference between the recorded systolic and diastolic pressures of 115 and 65 mmHg (i.e. the difference is 115-65=50). Similarly, the pressure gradient through the coarctation under exercise conditions could be predicted via modifying the inflow and outflow boundary conditions under resting conditions. CFD techniques make it possible to obtain information (such as pressure when the patient is under exercise condition) which is difficult to get in clinic practice or in experiment based on patient-specific data.	hemodynamics	Wenyu Fu;Aike Qiao	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-36961-2_1	engineering;anatomy;surgery;cardiology	NLP	30.230837190783202	-85.62746064468709	86525

Since mechanical properties of biological structures to be registered are usually unknown, a ”ground truth” validation of the results of image registration is not possible. This article presents a framework for the validation of elastic image registration techniques by a direct comparison of displacement fields vs analytical or numerical reference solutions of customizable boundary value problems. The proposed procedure enables an easy handling of material parameters, domain shapes and boundary conditions, and provides a flexible benchmark-tool for quantitative validation of elastic image registration algorithms.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);displacement mapping;ground truth;image registration;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;spline (mathematics)	Evgeny Gladilin;Karl Rohr;Roland Eils	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-71091-2_23	computer vision;mathematical optimization;free boundary condition;mathematics;geometry	Vision	51.49927982269353	-83.38022686573511	86700

Segmentation of organs at risk prior to the radiation ther- apy helps to prevent the radiation beam from damaging healthy tissue, whereas a concentrated ray can target the cancerous regions. Unfortu- nately, the manual annotation of all relevant structures in the head and neck area is very time-consuming and existing atlas-based solutions don't provide sufficient segmentation accuracy. Therefore, we propose an cou- pled shape model (CoSMo) for the segmentation of key structures within the head and neck area. The model's adaptation to a test image is done with respect to the appearance of its items and the trained articulation space. 40 data sets labeled by clinicians containing 22 structures were used to build the CoSMo. Even on very challenging data sets with unnat- ural postures, which occur far more often than expected, the model adap- tation algorithm succeeds. A first evaluation showed an average directed Hausdorff distance of 13.22 mm and an average DICE overlap of 0.62. Furthermore, we review some of the challenges we encountered during the course of building our model from image data, taken from actual radiation therapy planing cases.

This adaptive imaging system has the potential of creating images with optimal information within a given dose constraint and to acquire optimally exposed images of objects with variable density during one scan. In this paper we present the control system and results from initial tests on mammographic and encephalographic images. Furthermore, algorithms for visualization of the resulting images, consisting of unevenly exposed image regions, are developed and tested.

Several methods for tagging the cardiac tissue and tracking the motion of the tags have been developed. However, the choice of tag pattern that minimizes tracking error has received less attention. In this paper, we are concerned with the optimal tagging and acquisition of MR tagged images for cardiac motion analysis. We formulate the measurement of tissue deformation as a multidimensional parametric estimation problem which can be solved using the nonlinear least squares estimator. Along with this, we derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) on the average estimation error variance. We then show that under certain conditions a complex sinusoidal tag shape minimizes the CRLB. We validate our results with computer simulations. Finally, based on the previous findings, we make recommendations concerning the most desirable imaging strategy for images tagged with a complex sinusoidal tag pattern.		Thanh D. Nguyen;Stanley J.

Both technologies have major advantages and limitations. Although 4D echo is entering the study of the aortic root, 2D echo is the most commonly used diagnostic tool in daily practice. We designed and developed an algorithm for 3D modeling of the aortic root based on measures taken routinely at 2D echocardiography from 20 healthy individuals with normal aortic root. The tool was then translated in 12 patients who underwent both echo and MDCT. The results obtained with the 3D modeling program were quantitatively and qualitatively compared with 3D reconstruction from MDCT. Ad hoc ratios describing the morphology of the aortic root in MDCT and in the 3D model were used for comparison. In 12 patients with aortic root dilatation, the ratios obtained with our model are in good agreement with those from MDCT. Linear correlation for both long axis and short axis ratios was strong. The 3D modeling software can be easily adopted by cardiologists routinely involved in clinical evaluation of the pathology of the aortic root. The tool is easy to apply, does not require additional costs, and may be used to generate a set of data images for monitoring the evolution of the morphology and dimension of the aortic root, flanking the 3D MDCT and MR that remain the gold standard tools.	3d computer graphics;3d film;3d modeling;3d reconstruction;algorithm;anatomic structures;aortic root dilatation;apache axis;axis vertebra;bulb of aorta;ct scan;detectors;dilate procedure;echo (command);echocardiography;entity name part qualifier - adopted;flank (surface region);hoc (programming language);mathematical morphology;modified discrete cosine transform;numerous;patients;plant roots;resonance;root certificate;x-ray computed tomography	Simone Morganti;Adele Valentini;Valentina Favalli;Alessandra Serio;Fabiana I.

4fb303830f5897eae611f731f26acf8a9df992f8	validation of freesurfer-estimated brain cortical thickness: comparison with histologic measurements		FreeSurfer software package automatically estimates the cerebral cortical thickness. Its use is widely accepted, albeit this tool was validated against histologic measurements in only two post-mortem isolated brain MR scans. Indeed, a comparison between histologic measurements and FreeSurfer estimation from in vivo data was never performed. At the “Claudio Munari” Center for Epilepsy and Parkinson Surgery we have included FreeSurfer in our presurgical workflow since 2008, mainly because the automatic reconstruction of the brain surface is useful for carefully planning the surgical resection. We therefore compared cortical thickness values obtained by the automatic software pipeline with manual histologic measurements performed on 27 histologic specimens resected from the corresponding brain regions of the same epileptic subjects. This method-comparison study, including Passing–Bablok regression and Bland-Altman plot analysis, showed a good agreement between FreeSurfer estimation and histologic measurements of cortical thickness. The mean cortical thickness values (±Standard Deviation) obtained with FreeSurfer and histologic measurements were 3.65 mm ± 0.44 and 3.72 mm ± 0.36, respectively (P value = 0.32). Our findings strengthen previous reports on cortical thickness changes as biomarkers of different neurological conditions.	biological markers;computation;cortical implant;epilepsy;estimated;excision;food composition data;freesurfer;isolated brain;parkinsonian disorders;patients;pipeline (software);scicrunch;specimen;thickness (graph theory);video-in video-out;web page	Francesco Cardinale;Giuseppa Chinnici;Manuela Bramerio;Roberto Mai;Ivana Sartori;Massimo Cossu;Giorgio Lo Russo;Laura Castana;Nadia Colombo;Chiara Caborni;Elena De Momi;Giancarlo Ferrigno	2014	Neuroinformatics	10.1007/s12021-014-9229-2	pathology;computer science;surgery	ML	38.46272629190562	-81.6667306353939	87831

Deformation of the tissue can be recovered by tracking features using tissue surface information (texture, color,...). Recent work in this field has shown success in acquiring tissue motion. However, the performance evaluation of detection and tracking algorithms on such images are still difficult and are not standardized. This is mainly due to the lack of ground truth data on real data. Moreover, in order to avoid supplementary techniques to remove outliers, no quantitative work has been undertaken to evaluate the benefit of a pre-process based on image filtering, which can improve feature tracking robustness. In this paper, we propose a methodology to validate detection and feature tracking algorithms, using a trick based on forward-backward tracking that provides an artificial ground truth data. We describe a clear and complete methodology to evaluate and compare different detection and tracking algorithms. In addition, we extend our framework to propose a strategy to identify the best combinations from a set of detector, tracker and pre-process algorithms, according to the live intra-operative data. Experimental results have been performed on in vivo datasets and show that pre-process can have a strong influence on tracking performance and that our strategy to find the best combinations is relevant for a reasonable computation cost.	algorithm;computation;detectors;filter (signal processing);ground truth;minimally invasive surgical procedures;motion estimation;performance evaluation;preprocessor;recursion;video-in video-out	Faïçal Selka;Stéphane Nicolau;Vincent Agnus;Abdel Bessaid;Jacques Marescaux;Luc Soler	2015	Computerized medical imaging and graphics : the official journal of the Computerized Medical Imaging Society	10.1016/j.compmedimag.2014.11.012	computer vision;computer science;machine learning;data mining	Vision	44.66731409638392	-88.65767988545666	87903

It is often claimed that the original method is best suited to identify integer pixel displacements, which has prompted the development of numerous subpixel displacement identification methods. However, the fact that the phase correlation matrix is rank one for a noise-free rigid translation model is often overlooked. This property leads to the low complexity subspace identification technique presented here. The combination of noninteger pixel displacement identification without interpolation, robustness to noise, and limited computational complexity make this approach a very attractive extension of the PCM. In addition, this approach is shown to be complementary with other subpixel phase correlation based techniques.	computational complexity theory;displacement mapping;genetic translation process;integer (number);interpolation imputation technique;muscle rigidity;patient-centered medicine;phase correlation;pixel;protein-energy malnutrition;psychologic displacement	William Scott Hoge	2003	IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging	10.1109/TMI.2002.808359	computer vision;mathematical optimization;computer science;digital image correlation;image registration;mathematics;computational complexity theory;singular value decomposition;phase correlation	Vision	48.20193634901407	-82.35318474304174	88007

AAA shape and size is important for diagnostics and intervention planning. In this paper, we present a new method for segmentation of AAA from computed tomography (CT) angiography images. The method works by segmenting the inner and the outer aortic border. Segmentation of AAA is a challenging problem because of low contrast of the outer aortic border. In our method, the inner aortic border is segmented using a geometric deformable model (GDM) and morphological postprocessing. The GDM is implemented using the level-set algorithm. The outer aortic border is segmented by a preprocessing method utilizing a priori knowledge about the aorta shape, followed by the GDM-based method, and morphological postprocessing. The preprocessing algorithm operates on a slice-by-slice basis with some information flow among neighboring slices. The GDM performs three-dimensional (3D) segmentation, reducing possible errors in the previous step. The proposed method is automatic and requires minimal user assistance. The method was statistically validated on 12 patient scans having a total number of 497 image slices. Statistical analysis has confirmed high correlation between the results obtained by the proposed method and the gold standard obtained by manual segmentation by an expert radiologist.

The proposed model is tested on synthetic and real data derived using XMR imaging. We demonstrate a qualitative match between the estimated conductivity parameter and possible pathology locations.

In augmented reality (AR) visualization for neurosurgery, the live view of the surgical scene is merged with preoperative patient data, aiding the surgeon in mapping patient images from the image-guidance system to the real patient. Furthermore, augmented reality visualization allows the surgeon to see beyond the visible surface of the head or brain at the anatomy that is relevant at different stages of surgery. In this paper, the particular surgical tasks that have benefited from AR visualization by the neurosurgeons that have used our system are described. These tasks include: tailoring a craniotomy, localizing the anatomy of interest, planning a resection corridor and determining a surgical strategy. We present each of these surgical tasks and provide examples of how AR was used in the operating room.	augmented reality	Marta Kersten-Oertel;Ian Gerard;Simon Drouin;Kelvin Mok;Denis Sirhan;David S.

As part of the Dyslexia Early Screening Test (DEST), the resulting freehand sketches are assessed by an expert who analyses them visually and decides on the degree of similarity between the sketches and a shape copying scoring template. The assessment is time-consuming and rather subjective. In this paper, we investigate the use of Zernike moment descriptors as a feature extraction technique for training a k-nearest neighbour classifier to recognise and automatically assign scores to a set of hand-sketched shapes. A prototype shape copying assessment system DESCAR has been implemented using the Matlab programming environment. Scoring classification accuracy has been evaluated on a test corpus of 840 sketches comprising 120 different drawings of each of 7 different shapes used in the DEST study [16]. Experimental results show that machine score accuracy rates in the range 63.6-77.9% can be obtained in the correct assignment of scores when compared to a human expert assessor. Accuracy rates depend on geometric shape, order of Zernike moments and choice of classification test used.

In particular, a need for noninvasive techniques that measure both the nonlinear elastic and viscoelastic properties of breast tissue has been identified. For diagnostic purposes, it is important to select a nonlinear viscoelastic model with a small number of parameters that highly correlate with histological structure. However, the combination of conventional viscoelastic models with nonlinear elastic models requires a large number of parameters. A nonlinear viscoelastic model of breast tissue based on a simple equation with few parameters was developed and tested. The nonlinear viscoelastic properties of soft tissues in porcine breast were measured experimentally using fresh ex vivo samples. Robotic palpation was used for measurements employed in a finite element model. These measurements were used to calculate nonlinear viscoelastic parameters for fat, fibroglandular breast parenchyma and muscle. The ability of these parameters to distinguish the tissue types was evaluated in a two-step statistical analysis that included Holm’s pairwise $$t$$ t test. The discrimination error rate of a set of parameters was evaluated by the Mahalanobis distance. Ex vivo testing in porcine breast revealed significant differences in the nonlinear viscoelastic parameters among combinations of three tissue types. The discrimination error rate was low among all tested combinations of three tissue types. Although tissue discrimination was not achieved using only a single nonlinear viscoelastic parameter, a set of four nonlinear viscoelastic parameters were able to reliably and accurately discriminate fat, breast fibroglandular tissue and muscle.	benign neoplasm;bit error rate;body tissue;breast fibroglandular tissue;diagnosis, noninvasive;experiment;fatty acid glycerol esters;finite element method;histocompatibility testing;imperative programming;mammary gland parenchyma;mammary neoplasms;muscle;nonlinear system;palpation;platelet glycoprotein 4, human;population parameter;porcine species;prototype;stage 0 breast carcinoma;video-in video-out;soft tissue;t test	Mariko Tsukune;Yo Kobayashi;Tomoyuki Miyashita;Masakatsu G.

Recently, it was shown that the 1-D magnetic particle imaging process can be formulated as a convolution. Analyzing the width of the convolution kernel allows for predicting the spatial resolution of the method. However, this measure does not take into account the noise of the measured data. Furthermore, it does not consider a reconstruction step, which can increase the resolution beyond the width of the convolution kernel. In this paper, the spatial resolution of magnetic particle imaging is investigated by analyzing the modulation transfer function of the imaging process. An expression for the spatial resolution is derived, which includes the noise level and which is validated in simulations and experiments.	convolution;experiment;kernel;modulation;noise (electronics);simulation;transfer function;video-in video-out;width	Tobias Knopp;Sven Biederer;Timo Sattel;Marlitt Erbe;Thorsten M.

Advances in signal processing hardware permit software gating to replace traditional hardware gating. Although software gating can be advantageous, the added computational complexity hinders real-time operation, which is clinically desirable. Thus, high-resolution, real-time operation requires efficient algorithms for data processing. This paper develops a modified Goertzel structure for efficient real-time blood velocity profile estimation. When compared with traditional computational methods, this modified structure offers significant advantages with regard to memory, number of operations, and latency of estimation.

A topology optimization method in designing patient-specific craniofacial implants has been developed to ensure adequate load transfer mechanism and restore the form and function of the mid-face. Patient-specific finite element models are used to design these implants and to validate whether they are viable for physiological loading such as mastication. Validation of these topology optimized finite element models using mechanical testing is a critical step. Instead of inserting the implants into a cadaver or patient, we embed the implants into the computer-aided skull model of a patient and, fuse them together to 3D print the complete skull model with the implant. Masticatory forces are applied in the molar region to simulate chewing and measure the stress-strain trajectory. Until recently, strain gages have been used to measure strains for validation. Digital Image Correlation (DIC) method is a relatively new technique for full-field strain measurement which provides a continuous deformation field data. The main objective of this study is to validate the finite element model of patient-specific craniofacial implants against the strain data from the DIC obtained during the mastication simulation and show that the optimized shapes provide adequate load-transfer mechanism. Patient-specific models are obtained from CT scans. The principal maximum and minimum strains are compared. The computational and experimental approach to designing patient-specific implants proved to be a viable technique for mid-face craniofacial reconstruction.

Ultrasound imaging associated with Doppler methods is often used for blood flow evaluation. However, Doppler methods suffer from shortcomings such as limited spatial resolution and the inability to estimate lateral motion. Numerous methods such as block matching and decorrelation-based techniques have been proposed to overcome these limitations. In this paper, we propose an original method to estimate dense fields of vector velocity from ultrasound image sequences. Our proposal is based on a spatiotemporal approach and considers 2D+t data as a 3D volume. Orientation of the texture within this volume is related to velocity. Thus, we designed a bank of 3D quaternionic filters to estimate local orientation and then calculate local velocities. The method was applied to a large set of experimental and simulated flow sequences with low motion (≈1 mm/s) within small vessels (≈1 mm). Evaluation was conducted with several quantitative criteria such as the normalized mean error or the estimated mean velocity. The results obtained show the good behaviour of our method, characterizing the flows studied.	approximation error;decorrelation;lateral thinking;mean squared error;medical ultrasound;motion estimation;motion field;parabolic antenna;pixel;sampling (signal processing);velocity (software development);video-in video-out;voxel	Adrien Marion;Patrick Girard;Didier Vray	2010	EURASIP J.

However, the conventional registration methods suffer from misregistration because of the difference in rotation angles of human body around an axis parallel to the x-ray films, such as anteroposterior inclination. Such difference causes permutation of the shadows between the two images, which makes registration difficult. This article proposes a novel registration method in cases where two chest x-ray images have different rotation angles.   MATERIALS AND METHODS Twelve x-ray images taken from a chest phantom and four chest photofluorograms of two patients were used to evaluate the performance. First, the proposed algorithm estimates the rotation angles of the body from the pair of two x-ray images based on the function describing the relationship between a point in the current image and that in the previous image, which is derived from a three-dimensional rotational model of the body. Then it aligns two images according to the function.   RESULTS From the results of estimating rotation angles, it was found that proposed method can estimate the angles with an error of less than 1 degrees. Then two physicians evaluated the subtraction images and confirmed that this approach makes it possible to detect the interval changes accurately even if there are permutations of shadows in the x-ray image.   CONCLUSIONS The proposed method is superior to the conventional one when two chest x-ray images have different rotation angles.	axis vertebra;diagnostic radiologic examination;estimated;patients;phantoms, imaging;plain chest x-ray;roentgen rays;x-ray film;algorithm;registration - actclass	Akinobu Shimizu;Yoshie Matsuo;Hidefumi Kobatake	2004	Academic radiology		projective plane;computer vision;human body;mathematics;geometry;optics;change detection;statistics	Vision	42.84782054143208	-83.3598742501754	89382

The existence of cancer in prostate is usually examined by a biopsy procedure under the transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guidance. Development of a prostate biopsy robotics can alleviate urologists' labor and guarantee accuracy. However, it is usually impossible to identify cancer region in the noisy ultrasound images, thus leading to a random biopsy protocol for prostate. It is being recognized that Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Imaging (MRSI) techniques are potential to diagnose cancer distribution in prostate. So navigating the biopsy needle towards those cancer-suspected sites could improve the cancer detection rate and reduce the possibility of false negative diagnosis results. As the prostate usually deforms under the different rectal filling of probes and change of patient postures, a deformable registration scheme is implemented for the integration of the pre-operative MRI/MRSI information with the intra-operative TRUS images. A framework including a global rigid alignment and a sequent non-rigid transformation was described in this paper to match the cross-modal prostate surfaces and thereafter their volumes. For validation, an elastic prostate phantom that simulated the human condition was built up, with fiducial markers implanted inside the phantom prostate as the """"ground truth"""". It shows that our method can achieve at least 30% improvement in accuracy compared with an affine transformation.

A retrospective single-center analysis of 40 cases of irreversible electroporation of malignant liver tumors in 35 patients (6 females, 29 males, average age 60.3 years). Nineteen of these ablation procedures were performed manually and 21 with robotic assistance. A follow-up (ultrasound, CT, and MRI) was performed after 6 weeks in all patients. The time from the planning CT scan to the start of the ablation as well as the dose-length product were significantly lower under robotic assistance (63.5 vs. 87.4 min, $$p < 0.001$$ p < 0.001 ; 2132 vs. 4714 mGy cm, $$p < 0.001$$ p < 0.001 ). The procedural accuracy, measured as the deviation of the IRE probes with respect to a defined reference probe, was significantly higher using robotic guidance (2.2 vs. 3.1 mm, $$p < 0.001$$ p < 0.001 ). There were no complications. There was one incomplete ablation in the manual group. Robotic assistance for IRE of liver tumors allows for faster procedure times with higher accuracy while reducing radiation dose as compared to the manual placement of IRE probes.	ablation;amendment;ct scan;declaration (computer programming);diagnostically acceptable irreversible compression;electroporation therapy;helsinki declaration;liver diseases;liver neoplasms;maxima and minima;patients;robot;standards characteristics	Lukas Philipp Beyer;B.

e59ad37f77fdf96502796957a5623257686898a6	3d reconstruction of cfl ligament based on ultrasonographic images		Ultrasound imaging is a cost-effective diagnostic tool to analyze a number of diseases related to ligament, tendon, bone, blood flow estimation, etc. However, ultrasound imaging has some limitations such as shadowing, speckle noise, attenuation, mirror image, limited view visualization and inaccurate quantitative estimation that are the main causes of wrong interpretation about the CFL injuries by the clinicians. To overcome these investigated problems, this study proposed a 3D reconstruction method to enhance the Calcaneofibular Ligament (CFL) diagnosis, which is tested on collected datasets from the University Malaya Medical Center (UMMC), Malaysia. The proposed method uses the association of image segmentation, image registration, 3D smoothing, 3D median filtering, and standard marching cube method, patching and rendering methods to produce the more accurate 3D results. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, this research performed the qualitative and quantitative analysis based on the obtained results. On the basis of obtained results, the proposed method is found as a memory efficient method as compared to Oliver et al. method and Lorensen et al. method. Furthermore, performance of the proposed method is evaluated by the calculation of 3D geometrical metrics such as volume (1094.04 ± 74.97 mm3), thickness (2.06 ± 0.10 mm) and roughness (0.116 ± 0.02 mm), which are used in the estimation of healing rate of incurred injuries. In addition, this research opens new research dimensions for efficient musculoskeletal ultrasound modelling that makes it useful in clinical settings with accurate and cost effective diagnosis of CFL injuries.	3d reconstruction;courant–friedrichs–lewy condition;medical ultrasound	Vedpal Singh;Irraivan Elamvazuthi;Varun Jeoti;John George;Akshya K.

088da90f8dba935828597ef09b0c4b71c670d16f	recursive bayesian estimation of respiratory motion using a modified autoregressive transition model	stereoscopic cameras;motion estimation;medicine	Compensation for respiratory motion has been identified as a crucial factor in achieving high resolution Nuclear Medicine (NM) imaging. Many motion correction approaches have been studied and they are seen to have advantages over simpler approaches such as respiratory gating. However, all motion correction approaches rely on an assumption or estimation of respiratory motion. This paper builds upon previous work in recursive Bayesian estimation of respiratory motion assuming a stereo camera observation of the motion of the external torso surface. This paper compares the performance of a modified autoregressive transition model against the previously presented linear transition model used when estimating motion within a 4D dataset generated from the XCAT phantom.	autoregressive model;image resolution;imaging phantom;iterative closest point;jones calculus;kalman filter;linear model;motion estimation;nonlinear system;pf (firewall);particle filter;phantom reference;recursion (computer science);stereo camera	Ashrani Aizzuddin Abd.

However, th ese structures can be difficult to localize with conventional clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and thus targeting can be prone to error. Ultra-high-field imaging at 7T has the ability to clearly resolve these structures and thus atlase s built with these data have the potential to improve targeting accuracy. Methods T1 and T2-weighted images of 12 h ealthy control subjects were acquired using a 7T MR scanner. These images were then used with groupwise registration to generate an unbiased average template with T1w and T2w contrast. Deep brain structures were manually labelled in each subject by tw o raters and rater reliability was assessed. We compared the use of this unbiased atlas with two other methods of atlas-based segmentation (single-template and multi-template) for subthalamic nucleus (STN) segmentation on 7T MRI data. We also applied this atlas to clinical DBS data acquired at 1.5T to evaluate its efficacy for DBS target loca lization as compared to using a standard atlas. Results The unbiased templates provide superb detail of subcortical structures. Through one-way ANOVA tests, the unbiased template is significantly (p < 0.05) more accurate than a single-templa te in atlas-based segmentation and DBS target localization tasks. Conclusion The generated unbiased averaged templates provide bette r visualization of deep br ain nuclei and an increase in accuracy over single-template and lower field strength atlases.

Using an analytical spatiotemporal object model, the method can approximate time-varying kspace signals such as those from objects in motion and/or during dynamic contrast enhancement. Both rigid-body and non-rigid-body motions can be simulated using the proposed method. In addition, it can simulate data with arbitrary data sampling order and/or non-uniform k-space trajectory. A set of simulated images were compared with real data acquired from a rat model on a 4.7 T scanner to verify the model. The efficient simulation method is expected to be useful for rapid testing of various imaging and image analysis algorithms such as image reconstruction, image registration, motion compensation, and kinetic parameter mapping. 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

It has the advantage of noninvasiveness and high temporal resolution but suffers from poor spatial resolution and sensitivity to electrode movement and contact quality. EIT can be useful to applications, where there are conductive contrasts between tissues, fluids, or gasses, such as imaging of cancerous or ischemic tissue or functional monitoring of breathing, blood flow, gastric motility, and neural activity. The past decade has seen clinical application and commercial activity using EIT for ventilation monitoring. Interpretation of EIT-based measures is complex, and this review paper focuses on describing the image interpretation “pathway.” We review this pathway, from Tissue Electrical Properties, EIT Electrodes & Hardware, Sensitivity, Image Reconstruction, Image Processing to EIT Measures. The relationship is discussed between the clinically relevant parameters and the reconstructed properties. An overview is given of areas of EIT application and of our perspectives for research and development.	body surface;body tissue;cardiography, impedance;characteristic impedance;electric stimulation technique;electromagnetically induced transparency;functional electrical stimulation;gene regulatory network;image processing;iterative reconstruction;liquid substance;mental suffering;nominal impedance;respiration;stomach neoplasms;electric impedance;tomography	Andy Adler;Alistair Boyle	2017	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2017.2728323	image processing;iterative reconstruction;electrical impedance tomography;computer science;biomedical engineering;tomography;breathing;temporal resolution;image resolution;electrical conductor	Visualization	43.78850605235765	-87.06128700526816	90719
0b25466a418e87d16ba05905b693d8216c197f24	auditory support for navigated radiofrequency ablation		Radiofrequency ablation is applied to treat a lesion using a needle inserted into the patient, which delivers local radiofrequency energy. Guided surgical methods allow surgeons to view the placement of the needle in relation to the patient to aid in guiding the tip of the needle to the target point. Unfortunately, such methods require that surgeons remove attention from the patient in order to receive guidance information from a screen. We introduce a novel method to align and insert an ablation needle using auditory display, allowing the surgeon to retain attention on the patient. First evaluation results show that novice users can successfully guide a needle towards a target point using primarily auditory display. We hypothesize that successful auditory display will lead to increased attention on the patient and reduce unnecessary operator head and neck movements.	align (company);auditory display;radio frequency	David Black;Jumana Al Issawi;Christian Hansen;Christian Rieder;Horst K.

11dfb262d79dd4a285014bf31c57fc431b85c0ea	bone enhancement in ultrasound using local spectrum variations for guiding percutaneous scaphoid fracture fixation procedures		The scaphoid bone is the most frequently fractured bone in the wrist. When fracture fixation is indicated, a screw is inserted into the bone either in an open surgical procedure or percutaneously under fluoroscopic guidance. Due to the complex geometry of the wrist, fracture fixation is a challenging task. Fluoroscopic guidance exposes both the patient and the physician to ionizing radiation. Ultrasound-based guidance has been suggested as a real-time, radiation-free alternative. The main challenge of using ultrasound is the difficulty in interpreting the images due to the low contrast and noisy nature of the data. We propose a bone enhancement method that exploits local spectrum features of the ultrasound image. These features are utilized to design a set of quadrature band-pass filters and subsequently estimate the local phase symmetry, where high symmetry is expected at the bone locations. We incorporate the shadow information below the bone surfaces to further enhance the bone responses. The extracted bone surfaces are then used to register a statistical wrist model to ultrasound volumes, allowing the localization and interpretation of the scaphoid bone in the volumes. Feasibility experiments were performed using phantom and in vivo data. For phantoms, we obtain a surface distance error 1.08 mm and an angular deviation from the main axis of the scaphoid bone smaller than $$5^{\circ }$$ 5 ∘ , which are better compared to previously presented approaches. The results are promising for further development of a surgical guidance system to enable accurate anatomy localization for guiding percutaneous scaphoid fracture fixations.	anatomic structures;angularjs;apache axis;axis vertebra;bone cysts;bone tissue;clinical act of insertion;experiment;extraction;fracture fixation;guidance system;humeral fractures;ionizing radiation;open surgical procedure;operative surgical procedures;patients;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;real-time clock;scaphoid bone;small;video-in video-out;scaphoid fracture	Emran Mohammad Abu Anas;Alexander Seitel;Abtin Rasoulian;Paul St. John;David R.

Distortions and artifacts caused by cutting and staining of histological slices as well as differences in spatial resolution make even the rigid fusion a difficult task. State-of-the-art methods start with a mono-modal restacking yielding a histological pseudo-3D volume. The 3D information of the MRI reference is considered subsequently. However, consistency of the histology volume and consistency due to the corresponding MRI seem to be diametral goals. Therefore, we propose a novel fusion framework optimizing histology/histology and histology/MRI consistency at the same time finding a balance between both goals. Method - Direct slice-to-slice correspondence even in irregularly-spaced cutting sequences is achieved by registration-based interpolation of the MRI. Introducing a weighted multi-image mutual information metric (WI), adjacent histology and corresponding MRI are taken into account at the same time. Therefore, the reconstruction of the histological volume as well as the fusion with the MRI is done in a single step. Results - Based on two data sets with more than 110 single registrations in all, the results are evaluated quantitatively based on Tanimoto overlap measures and qualitatively showing the fused volumes. In comparison to other multi-image metrics, the reconstruction based on WI is significantly improved. We evaluated different parameter settings with emphasis on the weighting term steering the balance between intra- and inter-modality consistency.	mutual information	Christoph Palm;Graeme P.

2979a019f442b1d7f5f18d846063693d490d356c	using a new time-independent average method for non-invasive cardiac potential imaging of endocardial pacing with imprecise thorax geometry	heart;splines mathematics;electrocardiography;lead;electric potential;inverse problems	Cardiac electrical imaging from body surface potentials is a technology with great potential for pre-procedure planning in the context of ventricular ablation, based on body surface measurements of arrhythmic beats. Three clinically desirable properties of such an imaging system are the ability to localize endocardial as well as epicardial initiation sites, the ability to use fewer body surface leads than typical in a body surface mapping system, and the ability to maintain accuracy while limiting dependence on extensive anatomical imaging. At the same time,in the setting of premature ventricular beats, it is typically easy to obtain measurements of multiple beats with the same initiation site. Since sensitivity to measurement noise makes increased signal SNR desirable, multiple beats offer the possibility of improved accuracy. Here we compare standard ensemble averaging of the body surface measurements, reconstruction of individual beats followed by averaging of the results, and an averaging method developed by our group that is less sensitive to timing and propagation velocity variability from beat to beat, in the context of our recently reported method for endocardial pacing site localization using limited torso imaging. For a set of pacing site on the RV and LV endocardia of 3 subjects, we recorded multiple trials of 120 lead ECG and carried out inverse reconstructions using all three averaging methods. The reconstructed heart potentials were then used to estimate the pacing sites that were then validated against recorded pacing locations. The solutions from our time insensitive averaging method show improvement in localization accuracy over the solutions obtained with ensemble averaging, although the average of single-beat reconstructions results in better precision for most pacing sites.	ensemble averaging (machine learning);logical volume management;signal-to-noise ratio;software propagation;spatial variability;velocity (software development)	Jaume Coll-Font;Burak Erem;Petr Stovícek;Dana H.

Two major procedures in PGD include the rotation of the embryo to gain a more favorable position for zona breaching, and the extraction of a blastomere after an opening has been made in the zona pellucida. Rotation tracking of cleavage-stage embryos has not been reported given their lack of distinctive features. In this manuscript, a geometric model for partially determining the three dimensional (3-D) angular position of 2-cell embryos using two dimensional (2-D) microscopic brightfield images was derived and verified using a computer generated model. This model was then applied using computer vision algorithms on a rotating cleavage-stage mouse embryo, demonstrating partial 3-D rotation tracking. Furthermore, embryo micromanipulation tasks are typically performed manually using micropipettes. Technological advances have made automation of these tasks possible. This manuscript also presents computer vision algorithms for the segmentation and calibration of micropipettes. The calibration procedure allowed automated position control of the micropipettes without the need for real-time vision feedback using micropipette recognition algorithms, and effective position control was verified using semi-automated blastomere extraction experiments. This manuscript presents preliminary work towards the automation of cell manipulation procedures.	3d modeling;angularjs;computer vision;computer-aided design;experiment;feedback;genetic algorithm;geometric modeling;real-time clock;real-time locating system;semiconductor industry	Christopher Yee Wong;James K.

The system is an extension of our previous method [Comput. Vis. Image Understand. 83 (2001) 38] which finds corresponding 2D positions in different mammographic views. The method calculates curved epipolar lines by developing a simulation of breast deformation into stereo camera geometry. Using such curved epipolar lines, not only can we determine point correspondences, but can estimate the 3D location of a lesion. In this paper, we first explain the underlying principles and system organisation. The correctness of the 3D positions calculated by the system is examined using a set of breast lesions, which appear both in mammograms and in MRI data. The experimental results demonstrate the clinical promise of the CAD system.	computer-aided design;correctness (computer science);epipolar geometry;estimated;mammary neoplasms;mammography;simulation;stereo camera;visual instruction set	Yasuyo Kita;Eriko Tohno;Ralph Highnam;Michael Brady	2002	Medical image analysis	10.1016/S1361-8415(02)00084-1	three-dimensional space;computer vision;simulation;mathematics;computer graphics (images)	Vision	40.45813452107483	-83.02495423175655	91534

The new online MRI technique can obviously accelerate the imaging time for DMRI based on under-sampling acquisition and sparsity performance between neighbor frames. The data acquisition of previous online MRI schemes was based on the Cartesian coordinate. Non-Cartesian sampling, such as radial sampling, can obtain higher data acquisition speed than conventional Cartesian sampling. In order to further accelerate the imaging speed for online MRI, radial under-sampling instead of Cartesian under-sampling, was proposed to shorten the data acquisition time for DMRI. However the reconstruction of non-Cartesian data is complicated and time consumed, so GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) was used to shorten the reconstruction time. In this primary study, the full sampled cardiac dataset was used as a reference dataset, radial under-sampling with 25% and 10% k-space coverage was simulated for the online imaging scheme. The results show that radial under-sampling scheme obtained higher image quality than that of Cartesian acquisition scheme, with its imaging time still satisfying online reconstruction after applying GPU acceleration.	cartesian closed category;data acquisition;graphics processing unit;image quality;radial (radio);resonance;sampling (signal processing);sparse matrix	Xu Wang;Zhaoyang Jin	2016	2016 9th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing, BioMedical Engineering and Informatics (CISP-BMEI)	10.1109/CISP-BMEI.2016.7852777	iterative reconstruction;acceleration;computer vision;simulation;radiology;computer science;trajectory;magnetic resonance imaging;data acquisition;computer graphics (images)	Vision	48.93959051873211	-81.91050830677212	91634

Using true-color volume rendering, we interactively, selectively enhanced anatomy using feature detection. For example, to enhance red organs (vessels, liver, etc.) and internal surfaces, we computed a red feature from R/(R+G+B) and surface features from color/gray-scale gradients, respectively. For >70GB cryo-image volumes, we developed multi-resolution visualization, which provided low-resolution rendering of an entire mouse and zooming to organs, tissues, and cells. Fusions of fluorescence and color cryo-volumes uniquely showed biodistribution of metastatic and stem cells within an anatomical context.		Madhusudhana Gargesha;Mohammed Q.

The presence of stones in the kidney refers to Nephrolithiasis. For nephrolithiasis and kidney stones detection, a C-arm tomographic technique was investigated in this paper to generate three dimensional kidney structural information. A series of two dimensional (2D) x-ray projection images were acquired by moving the x-ray tube to different positions around the object over limited angular view with C-arm gantry. The results of our experiments were obtained by using a kidney phantom with low radiation dosage. Reconstruction algorithms based on distance driven (DD) method were developed for C-arm tomographic technique. Computer simulation study was done with simulated tomographic project images of spherical objects to evaluate the performance of each reconstruction algorithm. Preliminary results showed the capability to generate volume information of the kidney for nephrolithiasis and kidney stone detection.	algorithm;angularjs;computational human phantom;computer simulation;experiment;shepp–logan phantom;tomography	Nuhad A.

The slit lamp biomicroscope is the most commonly used device for this procedure, specially for the treatment of the eye periphery. However, only a small portion of the retina can be visualized through the biomicroscope, complicating the task of localizing and identifying surgical targets, increasing treatment duration and patient discomfort. In order to assist surgeons, we propose a method for creating intraoperative retina maps for view expansion using a slit-lamp device. Based on the mosaicking method described by Richa et al., 2012, the proposed method is a combination of direct and feature-based methods, suitable for the textured nature of the human retina. In this paper, we describe three major enhancements to the original formulation. The first is a visual tracking method using local illumination compensation to cope with the challenging visualization conditions. The second is an efficient pixel selection scheme for increased computational efficiency. The third is an entropy-based mosaic update method to dynamically improve the retina map during exploration. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we conducted several experiments on human subjects with a computer-assisted slit-lamp prototype. We also demonstrate the practical value of the system for photo documentation, diagnosis and intraoperative navigation.	area striata structure;bundle adjustment;diabetic retinopathy;distortion;documentation;entropy (information theory);experiment;illumination (image);image stitching;imagery;list of common shading algorithms;malaise;mosaic - computer software;obstruction;patients;pixel;prototype;retina;retinal diseases;retinal vein occlusion;slit lamp biomicroscope (physical object);super-resolution imaging;united states national institutes of health;video tracking;angiogram;biomedical engineering field	Rogério Richa;Rodrigo Linhares;Eros Comunello;Aldo von Wangenheim;Jean-Yves Schnitzler;Benjamin Wassmer;Claire Guillemot;Gilles Thuret;Philippe Gain;Gregory D.

e790d757813d2426bf5d548698b9a3d42b9d7041	pulmonary vessel tree matching for quantifying changes in vascular morphology		Invasive right-sided heart catheterization (RHC) is currently the gold standard for assessing treatment effects in pulmonary vascular diseases, such as chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). Quantifying morphological changes by matching vascular trees (pre- and post-treatment) may provide a non-invasive alternative for assessing hemodynamic changes. In this work, we propose a method for quantifying morphological changes, consisting of three steps: constructing vascular trees from the detected pulmonary vessels, matching vascular trees with preserving local tree topology, and quantifying local morphological changes based on Poiseuille’s law (changes in (radius^{-4}), (triangle r^{-4})). Subsequently, median and interquartile range (IQR) of all local (triangle r^{-4}) were calculated as global measurements for assessing morphological changes. The vascular tree matching method was validated with 10 synthetic trees and the relation between clinical RHC parameters and quantifications of morphological changes was investigated in 14 CTEPH patients, pre- and post-treatment. In the evaluation with synthetic trees, the proposed method achieved an average residual distance of (3.09 pm 1.28) mm, which is a substantial improvement over the coherent point drift method ((4.32 pm 1.89) mm) and a method with global-local topology preservation ((3.92 pm 1.59) mm). In the clinical evaluation, the morphological changes (IQR of (triangle r^{-4})) was significantly correlated with the changes in RHC examinations, (triangle text {sPAP}) ((mathrm{R}=-0.62), p-value = 0.019) and (triangle text {mPAP}) ((mathrm{R}=-0.56), p-value = 0.038). Quantifying morphological changes may provide a non-invasive assessment of treatment effects in CTEPH patients, consistent with hemodynamic changes from invasive RHC.	mathematical morphology	Zhiwei Zhai;Marius Staring;Hideki Ota;Berend C.

We approach this problem by combining deformable surface models and a fuzzy tissue classification technique. Our assumption is that contrast exists between brain tissue (gray matter and white matter) and cerebrospinal fluid, which separates the brain from the extra-cranial tissue. We first analyze the intensity of the entire image to find an approximate centroid of the brain and initialize an ellipsoidal surface around it. We then perform a fuzzy tissue classification with bias field correction within the surface. Tissue classification and bias field are extrapolated to the entire image. The surface iteratively deforms under a force field computed from the tissue classification and the surface smoothness. Because of the bias field correction and tissue classification, the proposed algorithm depends less on particular imaging contrast and is robust to inhomogeneous intensity often observed in magnetic resonance images. We tested the algorithm on all T1 weighted images in the OASIS database, which includes skull stripping results using Brain Extraction Tool; the Dice scores have an average of 0.948 with a standard deviation of 0.017, indicating a high degree of agreement. The algorithm takes on average 2 minutes to run on a typical PC and produces a brain mask and membership functions for gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. We also tested the algorithm on T2 images to demonstrate its generality, where the same algorithm without parameter adjustment gives satisfactory results.	approximation algorithm;extrapolation;force field (chemistry);resonance	Xiaodong Tao;Ming-Ching Chang	2010		10.1117/12.844061	magnetism;membership function;magnetic resonance imaging;force field;standard deviation;physics	Vision	40.555607504577175	-80.91381487981258	92320

fe12780df87ee0774f7c4c9caaa37b738134b633	ultrasound elastography of breast cancer-related lymphedema		Accurate methods of staging breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) are lacking and have become a major cause of concern among clinicians. However, with the application of novel techniques in ultrasound elastography, clinicians may be able to better assess BCRL and provide targeted treatments to reduce the progression of this condition. In this paper, we propose to use strain images estimated using quasi-static ultrasound elastography techniques to investigate its usefulness in staging lymphedema. We further propose a novel approach for estimating the strain images from two frames of ultrasound data. Using data collected from two patients with lymphedema, we show that strain images can potentially be used to accurately diagnose lymphedema. Using phantom and in-vivo data, we further show that the proposed strain estimation technique substantially outperforms previous work.	color gradient;disk staging;elastography;phantom reference;video-in video-out	H.

The discrete cubic spline wavelet was used to calculate time delay and frequency characteristics of the wave that is propagated on the surface of 3 canine lungs. The analysis verified previous results ascertaining the linear elastic model. As the vascular volume, extra vascular lung water and lung density increased, the wave velocities were decreased; that is the wave velocities were inversely proportional to the square root of the lung density. The analysis verified the exact time-frequency relationship for the dominant stress wave velocity (i.e., shear or Rayleigh-type surface wave velocity) and showed other transit times besides the previously observed short and long ones are not valid.	delay calculation;wavelet	Mehran Jahed;Bizhan Najafi;Ali Kamen;Stephen J.

4e61ff21c9e22c14107cc8d318d4fefead94f5a2	influence of wilson ce nter terminal on fetal electrocardiography acquisition*		The acquisition of a standard 10-leads electrocardiography (ECG) is performed using the Wilson Center Terminal (WCT) reference with a normalized electrode positioning. However, in the case of non-invasive fetal ECG (fECG) acquisition, there is no standardization on the positioning of the electrodes on the abdomen and many authors suggest an acquisition with or without a WCT. The use of the WCT for the acquisition of the fetal heart rate (FHR) is not justified. The objective of this paper is to quantify the influence of this reference compared to a direct measurement. For this purpose, we developed a device allowing the acquisition of the fECG and compared the two configurations on 6 volunteer pregnants. The noise levels and the fetal QRS morphology were compared, showing no superiority of the WCT acquisition compared to a direct differential measurement.	electrocardiography;fetal heart;galaxy morphological classification;hepatolenticular degeneration;electrode	P.

Retinal videos help ophthalmologists in diagnosis and analysis of the different eye impairments. Such videos contain the essential information, however, illuminating devices used for capturing fine details result in formation of blobs in the captured video. Resultantly, visibility of the eye is masked and obscures the observation of underlying area. This paper proposes a method of removing the blobs (artifacts) from retinal videos based on automatic video registration. Rigid registration model is used for intra-video (inter-frame) registration; normalized mutual information is used as image similarity measure which is optimized using Powell's method. The registration results show very good alignment between the frames and blobs are removed by replacing the area under them from the other frames. The results are checked on six retinal videos and they seem very promising.	color gradient;mutual information;powell's method;similarity measure	Muhammad Faisal Khan;Muhammad Saqib;Adil Masood Siddiqui;Naveed Iqbal Rao	2011	2011 4th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics (BMEI)	10.1109/BMEI.2011.6098261	medical imaging;computer vision;radiology;computer science;image registration;multimedia;image segmentation;computer graphics (images)	Vision	41.16089371599536	-80.30318285375755	92966

In this paper, a new adaptive clutter rejection method based on spectral analysis (ACR-SA) is presented for suppressing nonstationary clutter. In ACR-SA, tissue and flow characteristics are analyzed by singular value decomposition and tissue acceleration of backscattered Doppler signals to determine an appropriate clutter filter from a set of clutter filters. To evaluate the ACR-SA method, 20 frames of complex baseband data were acquired by a commercial ultrasound system equipped with a research package (Accuvix V10, Samsung Medison, Seoul, Korea) using a 3.5-MHz convex array probe by introducing tissue movements to the flow phantom (Gammex 1425 A LE, Gammex, Middleton, WI, USA). In addition, 20 frames of in vivo abdominal data from five volunteers were captured. From the phantom experiment, the ACR-SA method provided 2.43 dB (p <; 0.001) and 1.09 dB ( ) improvements in flow signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) compared to static (STA) and down-mixing (ACR-DM) methods. Similarly, it showed smaller values in fractional residual clutter area (FRCA) compared to the STA and ACR-DM methods (i.e., 2.3% versus 5.4% and 3.7%, respectively, ). The consistent improvements in SCR from the proposed ACR-SA method were obtained with the in vivo abdominal data (i.e., 4.97 dB and 3.39 dB over STA and ACR-DM, respectively). The ACR-SA method showed less than 1% FRCA values for all in vivo abdominal data. These results indicate that the proposed ACR-SA method can improve image quality in CDI by providing enhanced rejection of nonstationary clutter.	1-hexylindolactam-v10;acr gene;acsm3 gene;american college of radiology;baseband;blood vessel;body tissue;clutter;cluttering;computational human phantom;deny (action);dextromethorphan hydrobromide 2 mg/ml / guaifenesin 20 mg/ml oral solution;double minutes;estimated;experiment;fb term type;frame (physical object);hemodynamics;hypothalamic area, lateral;image quality;imaging phantom;movement;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;rejection sampling;singular value decomposition;small;sulfanilamide;video-in video-out;decimeter	Geunyong Park;Sunmi Yeo;Jae Jin Lee;Changhan Yoon;Hyun-woo Koh;Hyungjoon Lim;Youngtae Kim;Hwan Shim;Yang-Mo Yoo	2014	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2013.2276088	computer vision;electronic engineering;speech recognition;engineering;hemodynamics;mathematics;physiology;singular value decomposition	Visualization	50.413850374937425	-85.5028979155537	93150

bea672f13d4369f078fad24dd58b5da4f7c853ba	self super-resolution for magnetic resonance images	mri;super resolution;self generated training data	It is faster and therefore cheaper to acquire magnetic resonance images (MRI) with higher in-plane resolution than through-plane resolution. The low resolution of such acquisitions can be increased using post-processing techniques referred to as super-resolution (SR) algorithms. SR is known to be an ill-posed problem. Most state-of-the-art SR algorithms rely on the presence of external/training data to learn a transform that converts low resolution input to a higher resolution output. In this paper an SR approach is presented that is not dependent on any external training data and is only reliant on the acquired image. Patches extracted from the acquired image are used to estimate a set of new images, where each image has increased resolution along a particular direction. The final SR image is estimated by combining images in this set via the technique of Fourier Burst Accumulation. Our approach was validated on simulated low resolution MRI images, and showed significant improvement in image quality and segmentation accuracy when compared to competing SR methods. SR of FLuid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) images with lesions is also demonstrated.		Amod Jog;Aaron Carass;Jerry L.

Total variation (TV) is usually used as the regularization function for image reconstruction. However, it is know that such ℓ<sub>1</sub>-based minimization algorithm needs more measurements than the ℓ<sub>0</sub>-based ones. On the other hand, ℓ<sub>0</sub>-based minimization is computational intractable and unstable. In this paper, we propose a hybrid total variation (HTV) which effectively integrates both ℓ<sub>1</sub>-norm and ℓ<sub>0</sub>-norm of the image gradient by introducing a threshold. The HTV minimization algorithm has the benefits of both the robustness of ℓ<sub>1</sub> and fewer measurements of ℓ<sub>0</sub>. Simulations and in vivo experiments demonstrate the proposed method outperforms the conventional TV minimization algorithm.	algorithm;compressed sensing;computation;computer simulation;control theory;experiment;image gradient;iterative reconstruction;resonance;video-in video-out	Yong Wang;Dong Liang;Yuchou Chang;Leslie Ying	2012	2012 9th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)	10.1109/ISBI.2012.6235487	data compression;iterative reconstruction;fourier transform;computer vision;minimisation;mathematical optimization;radiology;computer science;magnetic resonance imaging;mathematics;compressed sensing;total variation;encoding	Vision	50.403513273089786	-80.70875752394194	93486

If the aneurysm volume is known, a physician may treat an aneurysm by filling it with coils or glue. We presented a fully-automatic aneurysm labelling method to compute this volume in a previous paper. The global distance thresholds of this method may result in an estimated aneurysm volume which is too large. We developed a method to derive local distance thresholds from the segmented vasculature. Application of these thresholds gives better estimates for the aneurysm volumes.

A typical challenge for optimal control design is the inclusion of constraints resulting from physiological or technical limitations that assure the realizability of the optimized pulses. In this paper, we show how to treat such inequality constraints, in particular, amplitude constraints on the B1 field, the slice-selective gradient, and its slew rate, as well as constraints on the slice profile accuracy. For the latter, a pointwise profile error and additional phase constraints are prescribed. Here, a penalization method is introduced that corresponds to a higher order tracking instead of the common quadratic tracking. The order is driven to infinity in the course of the optimization. We jointly optimize for the RF and slice-selective gradient waveform. The amplitude constraints on these control variables are treated efficiently by semismooth Newton or quasi-Newton methods. The method is flexible, adapting to many optimization goals. As an application, we reduce the power of refocusing pulses, which is important for spin echo-based applications with a short echo spacing. Here, the optimization method is tested in numerical experiments for reducing the pulse power of simultaneous multislice refocusing pulses. The results are validated by phantom and in-vivo experiments.	computation (action);constrained optimization;customize;experiment;gradient;mathematical optimization;newton;numerical analysis;optimal control;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;quasi-newton method;radio frequency;resonance;social inequality;spin echo;track and trace;video-in video-out;waveform	Armin Rund;Christoph Stefan Aigner;Karl Kunisch;Rudolf Stollberger	2018	IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging	10.1109/TMI.2017.2758391	mathematics;slew rate;mathematical optimization;amplitude;order tracking;optimal control;waveform;spin echo;pulse (signal processing);pointwise	Visualization	51.34702573219832	-80.4674542596791	93639

Current commercial interventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners are capable of performing anatomical and diffusion weighted imaging and are used for guidance during various neurosurgical procedures. We present an interventional imaging workflow that can accurately localize the optic radiation during surgery. The workflow is driven by a near real-time multichannel nonrigid image registration algorithm that uses both anatomical and fractional anisotropy pre- and intra-operative images. The proposed workflow is implemented on graphical processing units and we perform a warping of the pre-operatively parcellated optic radiation to the intra-operative space in under 3 min making the proposed algorithm suitable for use under the stringent time constraints of neurosurgical procedures. The method was validated using both a numerical phantom and clinical data using pre- and post-operative images from patients who had undergone surgery for treatment of refractory focal epilepsy and shows strong correlation between the observed post-operative visual field deficit and the predicted damage to the optic radiation. We also validate the algorithm using interventional MRI datasets from a small cohort of patients. This work could be of significant utility in image guided interventions and facilitate effective surgical treatments.	acoustic lobing;diffusion weighted imaging;epilepsies, partial;epilepsy;epilepsy, partial, motor;eye;focal (programming language);fractional anisotropy;graphical user interface;image registration;magnetic resonance imaging;magnetic resonance imaging, interventional;multistage interconnection networks;neurosurgical procedures;numerical analysis;operative surgical procedures;optics;patients;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;real-time clock;real-time computing;science of neurosurgery;temporal lobe;algorithm	Pankaj Daga;Gavin P Winston;Marc Modat;Mark White;Laura Mancini;Manuel Jorge Cardoso;Mark R.

In this work, we investigate FL ultrasound imaging using a single-element transducer integrated in a steerable catheter, together with an optical shape sensing (OSS) system. <italic>Methods:</italic> We tested the feasibility of the proposed device by imaging the surface of a tissue-mimicking (TM) phantom and an <italic>ex vivo</italic> human carotid plaque. While manually steering the catheter tip, ultrasound A-lines are acquired at 60 Hz together with the catheter shape from the OSS system, resulting in a two-dimensional sparse and irregularly sampled data set. We implemented an adaptive Normalized Convolution (NC) algorithm to interpolate the sparse data set by applying an anisotropic Gaussian kernel that is rotated according to the local direction of the catheter scanning pattern. To choose the Gaussian widths tangential (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">${\sigma _t}$</tex-math></inline-formula>) and normal (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">${\sigma _n}$</tex-math></inline-formula>) to the scanning pattern, an exhaustive search was implemented based on RMSE computation on simulated data. <italic>Results:</italic> Simulations showed that the sparse data set contains only 5% of the original information. The chosen widths, <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">${\sigma _n} = \text{250}\;\mu {\textrm{m}}$</tex-math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">${\sigma _t} = \text{100}\;\mu{\textrm{m}}$</tex-math></inline-formula>, are used to successfully reconstruct the surface of the phantom with a contrast ratio of 0.9. The same kernel is applied successfully to the carotid plaque data. <italic>Conclusion:</italic> The proposed approach enables FL imaging with a single ultrasound element, mounted on a steerable device. <italic>Significance:</italic> This principle may find application in a variety of image-guided interventions, such as chronic total occlusion (CTO) recanalization."""	algorithm;brute-force search;calcium-sensing receptor;chronic total occlusion vessel;computation;computer simulation;contrast ratio;convolution;dental plaque;imaging phantom;interpolation;iterative reconstruction;kernel;medical ultrasound;normal statistical distribution;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;sampling - surgical action;sparse matrix;transducer;ultrasonography;alteplase	Jovana Janjic;Frits Mastik;Merel Leistikow;Johannes G Bosch;Geert Springeling;Antonius F.

Cells experience nonlinear large deformations during the aspiration procedure. Neo-Hookean viscohyperelastic (NHVH) incompressible and compressible models were used to simulate the creep behavior of cells in MA, particularly accounting for the effect of compressibility, bulk relaxation, and hardening phenomena under large strain. In order to find optimal material parameters, the models were fitted to the experimental data available for mesenchymal stem cells. Finally, through Neo-Hookean porohyperelastic (NHPH) material model for the cell, the influence of fluid flow on the aspiration length of the cell was studied. Based on the results, we suggest that the compressibility and bulk relaxation/fluid flow play a significant role in the deformation behavior of single cells and should be taken into account in the analysis of the mechanics of cells.	1 ml phenylephrine hydrochloride 10 mg/ml injection [neo-synephrine];aspiration-action;fine needle aspiration biopsy;instruction creep;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;mechanics;mesenchymal stem cells;multiscale modeling;neo geo;nonlinear system;seizures;simulation;video-in video-out;fluid flow	Amirhossein Jafari Bidhendi;Rami K.

The results show that the spacer plays an important role in initial stability for fusion, and high compressive force is predicted at the ventral endplate for the models with the spacer and fusion bone together. By varying the positioning of the spacer anteriorly along anteroposterior axis, no significant change in terms of axial stiffness, compressive stress, and bulging of the endplate are predicted for the implant model. The findings suggest that varying the spacer position in surgical situations does not affect the mechanical behavior of the lumbar spine after interbody fusion.	apache axis;axial loading;axis vertebra;bone tissue;compression;dendritic spine;finite element method;oracle fusion middleware;spacer device component	Kheng K.

With digital pathology, images are being read on a display system, and this poses new types of questions: such as what is the difference in terms of pixelation, refresh lag or obscured features compared to an optical microscope. Is there a resultant change in user performance in terms of speed of slide review, perception of adequacy and quality or in diagnostic confidence? A prior psychophysical study was carried out comparing various display modalities on whole slide imaging (WSI) in pathology at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) in the USA. This prior study compared professional and non-professional grade display modalities and highlighted the importance of using a medical grade display to view pathological digital images. This study was duplicated in Europe at the Department of Pathology in Erasme Hospital (Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB)) in an attempt to corroborate these findings. Digital WSI with corresponding glass slides of 58 cases including surgical pathology and cytopathology slides of varying difficulty were employed. Similar non-professional and professional grade display modalities were compared to an optical microscope (Olympus BX51). Displays ranged from a laptop (DELL Latitude D620), to a consumer grade display (DELL E248WFPb), to two professional grade monitors (Eizo CG245W and Barco MDCC-6130). Three pathologists were selected from the Department of Pathology in Erasme Hospital (ULB) in Belgium to view and interpret the pathological images on these different displays. The results show that non-professional grade displays (laptop and consumer) have inferior user experience compared to professional grade monitors and the optical microscope. © (2013) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

Their technique is based on the development of a new class of physics-based deformable models whose parameters are functions. They allow the definition of new parameterized primitives and parameterized deformations which can capture the local shape variation of a complex object. Furthermore, these parameters are intuitive and require no complex post-processing in order to be used by a physician. Using a physics-based approach, the authors convert the geometric models into dynamic models that deform due to forces exerted from the datapoints and conform to the given dataset. The authors present experiments involving the extraction of the shape and motion of the LV's mid-wall during systole from tagged MRI data based on a few parameter functions. Furthermore, by plotting the variations over time of the extracted LV model parameters from normal and abnormal heart data along the long axis, the authors are able to quantitatively characterize their differences.	apache axis;axis vertebra;experiment;extraction;heart ventricle;left ventricular structure;logical volume management;magnetic resonance imaging;population parameter;silo (dataset);systole <eukaryote>;tracer;video post-processing;physical hard work	Jinah Park;Dimitris N.

The purpose of the algorithm is to provide live feedback to the user on the quality of the acquired image. The proposed approach uses Generalized Hough Transform to compare the structures derived from the incoming image to a representative atlas, thereby providing a quality metric (PQM). On 133 PLAX images from 35 patients, we show: 1) PQM has high correlation with manual ratings from an expert echocardiographer 2) PQM has high correlation with contrast-to-noise ratio, a traditional indicator of image quality 3) on images with high PQM, error in automatic septal wall thickness measurement is low, and vice versa.	acquired image;algorithm;apache axis;arterial pulse quality:type:pt:xxx:nom:palpation;atlases;cardiovascular technologist;contrast-to-noise ratio;echocardiography;estimated;generalised hough transform;image quality;patients;thickness (graph theory)	Sri-Kaushik Pavani;Navneeth Subramanian;Mithun Das Gupta;Pavan Annangi;Satish C.

b530b52a87fc68f360b9dcb5c05fb005660d7059	removal of gradient artefacts during transient head movements for continuous eeg-fmri		This paper presents a novel approach for removing gradient artefacts from the EEG signal recorded during continuous EEG-fMRI, which are influenced by transient head movements of the subject within the magnetic scanner. Transient head movements provoke abrupt changes in the gradient artefact waveform, in such a way that they compromise the estimation of an artefact waveform to be subtracted and achieve the EEG correction. According to our proposed methodology, a cubic spline waveform is used to model and represent the signal transitions components. This model is then used to change and approximate the shape of the EEG signal as homogeneous data, in order to improve the performance of the gradient artefact correction technique. The proposed approach also makes use of the signal slope adaption (SSD) method, combined with sum-of-sinusoids modelling for correction of the gradient artefact.

489cdadc9bdd4562a0d5598fe115c6d2722238f3	fiberfox: an extensible system for generating realistic white matter software phantoms		We present an open-source system, Fiberfox, for generating synthetic diffusion-weighted datasets. Fiberfox enables (1) definition of artificial white matter fibers, (2) signal generation from those fibers using multi-compartment modeling, and (3) simulation of magnetic resonance artifacts including Gibbs ringing, N=2 ghosting and susceptibility distortions. With a comparative hardware phantom study we show that the synthetic datasets closely resemble real acquisitions. To demonstrate the relevance of Fiberfox for current research questions, we reveal the adverse effects of anisotropic voxels on the outcome of 11 different fiber tractography algorithms. Fiberfox is openly available and may find application in the validation and further development of diffusion-weighted image processing techniques such as super-resolution, denoising, tractography, diffusion modeling or artifact correction.

However, this technique remains relatively invasive and difficult to use in longitudinal trials. The development of alternative non-invasive tests, namely exploiting high-resolution imaging modalities such as MSCT, is gaining interest in the medical community. This paper develops a fullyautomated airway shape assessment approach based on the 3D segmentation of the airway lumen from MSCT data. The objective is to easily notify the radiologist on bronchus shape variations (stenoses, bronchiectasis) along the airway tree during a simple visual investigation. The visual feed-back is provided by means of a volumerendered color coding of the airway calibers which are robustly defined and computed, based on a specific 3D discrete distance function able to deal with small size structures. The color volume rendering (CVR) information is further on reinforced by the definition and computation of a shape variation index along the airway medial axis enabling to detect specific configurations of stenoses. Such cases often occur near bifurcations (bronchial spurs) and they are either missed in the CVR or difficult to spot due to occlusions by other segments. Consequently, all detected shape variations (stenoses, dilations and thickened spurs) can be additionally displayed on the medial axis and investigated together with the CVR information. The proposed approach was evaluated on a MSCT database including twelve patients with severe or moderate persistent asthma, or severe COPD, by analyzing segmental and subsegmental bronchi of the right lung. The only CVR information provided for a limited number of views allowed to detect 78% of stenoses and bronchial spurs in these patients, whereas the inclusion of the shape variation index enabled to complement the missing information.© (2010) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

In the next step, Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) analysis is described and utilised for assessment of the minimum estimation error and uncertainty level of different Diffusion Weighted Magnetic Resonance (DWMR) signal decay models. The analyses are performed considering the best scenario through which, we assume that the models are the appropriate representation of the measured phenomena. This includes the study of the sensitivity of the estimations to the measurement and model parameters. It is demonstrated that none of the existing models can achieve a reasonable minimum uncertainty level under typical measurement setup. At the end, the practical obstacles for achieving higher performance in clinical and experimental environments are studied and their effects on feasibility of the methods are discussed.	qualitative comparative analysis;resonance	Hamed Yousefi Mesri	2013	CoRR		simulation	NLP	45.1763866752819	-85.98259249832083	95803
a6450359a717ab396823195698a8f60d6592bda0	ultrasound transducer tracking system for correlation of masses in combined x-ray and manual breast ultrasound imaging		Breast ultrasound has been used in the USA primarily as an adjunct breast cancer diagnosis to projection x-ray mammography or DBT. Ultrasound is employed in screening in most of the world and its use for such dense breast is increasing in the USA. In either application, finding corresponding masses in images from both x-ray and ultrasound is time-consuming and prone to correlation errors, leading to delays in cancer diagnosis. Previously, we have shown that, when automated breast ultrasound is performed through a special mammographic paddle in the same or slightly reduced compression as the x-ray exam, such correlation errors were reduced [1-2] . Even for hand-controlled scanning, it should be useful to track the physical position and orientation of the ultrasound transducer in the coordinates of the x-ray to help in reducing both exam time and correlation errors in mass identification. A tracking system for hand scanning through a mesh mammographic paddle is achieved via the coordination of a full-HD camera and a 6-axis sensor, locates the path of the real time ultrasound image plane through the x-ray image or image stack. The tracking system requires minimal setup, with the camera mounted to a fixed location relative to the paddle and the 6-axis sensor attached to the transducer body. The tracking system can achieve an overall frame rate of 5 Hz and mean position error within 6.62mm. In a parallel display, a mass identified in the x-ray image volume will be used to generate trajectories for an ultrasound transducer to reach the same mass. Feasible, improved position tracking should allow creation of spliced 3D volumes and precise, multimodality image fusion.	medical ultrasound;tracking system;transducer	Qi You;Rungroj Jintamethasawat;Yuxin Wang;Jie Yuan;Marilyn A.

This comparative work represents an important advance in the diagnostic armamentarium for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), where no definitive diagnostic tests are available. This preliminary report describes morphometric analyses of MRI datasets of AD and FTD patients, and relates these to clinical measures. We will begin this paper by describing voxel based morphometry (VBM), a powerful, quantitative tool for analyzing structural brain images. We then describe our implementation of a fully automated, user-independent algorithm for morphometric analysis of structural MRI data.	morphometrics;voxel	Michael P. Lin;Christian Devita;James C.

While real-time imaging is often not available, it is necessary to estimate the lung motion from real-time measurable signals such as on-chest/abdominal fiducials or surface. Traditional regression models take the entire lung motion deformation as a whole and perform the estimation in a global manner. Given high dimensionality and complexity of the lung motion patterns, the correlation of lung motion in different local areas with the surface motion could be different. Therefore, we propose a combined global and local statistics-based estimation to improve the estimation accuracy because local deformations have similar patterns and could have higher correlation with the surface motion. Results with 37 4D-CT datasets suggest local motion estimation further improves the performance for lung respiratory motion modeling.	statistical model	Zhong Xue;Ramiro Pino;Bin S.

In radiology departments, this will force radiologists to review medical images several times, since the images need to be visualized with several different contrast windows (transfer functions) in order for the full content of each image to be seen. Previously suggested methods for handling this situation include various approaches using histogram equalization and other methods for processing the image data. However, none of these utilize the underlying human anatomy in the images to control the visualization and the fact that different transfer functions are often only relevant for disjoint anatomical regions. In this paper, we propose a method for using model-based local transfer functions. It allows the reviewing radiologist to apply multiple transfer functions simultaneously to a medical image volume. This provides the radiologist with a tool for making the review process more efficient, by allowing him/her to review more of the information in a medical image volume with a single visualization. The transfer functions are automatically assigned to different anatomically relevant regions, based upon a model registered to the volume to be visualized. The transfer functions can be either pre-defined or interactively changed by the radiologist during the review process. All of this is achieved without adding any unfamiliar aspects to the radiologist’s normal work process, when reviewing medical image volumes.	dynamic range;histogram equalization;interactivity;microsoft windows;radiology;transfer function;windows easy transfer	Daniel Forsberg;Claes F Lundström;Mats T.

In order to cope with this issue, we perform an estimation of contrast-enhanced parenchyma in projection images. The estimation is based on a vessel segmentation and an iterative interpolation of segmented vessel pixels. The estimated parenchyma is subsequently separated from the projection images. Thus, only contrast-enhanced vessels remain and data inconsistencies due to late-enhancing parenchyma will be reduced. The method is applied to two datasets of cerebral vasculatures. The image series are compared prior and post to parenchyma subtraction. Reconstructed volumes show minor noise in background voxels. An average increase of 37% in signal-to-noise ratio is achieved.

fdf1022a72f2e872d42d04bdf6fff52948202216	a quantitative evaluation of errors induced by reduced field-of-view in diffusion tensor imaging		To obtain a better insight in tissue microstructures using diffusion MRI, a high resolution and dense sampling of q-space is required. In clinical settings, however, this can often not be achieved due to limited acquisition time. Reduced field-of-view (FOV) approaches counteract this limitation but may pose a challenge for the post-processing steps such as motion and artifact correction. We present an evaluation of the potential problems that arise with reduced FOV data during the standard post-processing. The acquisition with reduced FOV is extracted from a full FOV dataset. We select three different registration tools to perform the standard data post-processing pipeline. We first evaluate the spatial error and then measure its impact on the tensor reconstruction as well as on the derived fractional anisotropy (FA). With reduced FOV images, the multi-scale registration methods showed high sensitivity to parameter selection and produced up to 30 % outliers. With an optimized parameter set, all registration methods yielded spatial errors of 1 mm (±0.572). The spatial error resulted in a mean error of 0.03 (±0.013) in the estimated FA values, and was thus of the same magnitude as group differences as they are typically reported in DTI studies. Regions with large FA differences were located especially in the corpus callosum. The evaluation indicates that diffusion-weighted MR acquisitions with reduced FOV require careful selection of registration parameters and also cautious interpretation when quantifying derived indices.

32e63405b602398636e82c96881d526fa615dd48	an automated quality control program for whole breast digital image receptors		Quality control (QC) procedures required by manufacturers of whole breast digital equipment are based primarily on screen/film QC procedures rather than being designed specifically for digital image receptors. Inappropriate Gammex 156 phantom exposure (used for ACR mammography accreditation testing) cannot be determined by measuring the optical density of the phantom image printed by a laser onto film. Perception of the third speck group (each speck is 0.32 mm in diameter), used as a criterion of adequate imaging in the United States’ Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA), is inadequate for digital mammography systems. Furthermore, variations across the digital image receptor are greater than variations encountered in screen/film systems, so that phantoms which do not test the entire image receptor may also prove to be inadequate. For these reasons, development of new phantom test criteria is necessary for these new systems. At the same time, there is an opportunity to score these digital images automatically.

038718ed324a1a936d9358704cd9f095608204c9	calibration of rgbd camera and cone-beam ct for 3d intra-operative mixed reality visualization	cone beam ct;c arm;3d 3d calibration;intra operative imaging;augmented reality	This work proposes a novel algorithm to register cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) volumes and 3D optical (RGBD) camera views. The co-registered real-time RGBD camera and CBCT imaging enable a novel augmented reality solution for orthopedic surgeries, which allows arbitrary views using digitally reconstructed radiographs overlaid on the reconstructed patient’s surface without the need to move the C-arm. An RGBD camera is rigidly mounted on the C-arm near the detector. We introduce a calibration method based on the simultaneous reconstruction of the surface and the CBCT scan of an object. The transformation between the two coordinate spaces is recovered using Fast Point Feature Histogram descriptors and the Iterative Closest Point algorithm. Several experiments are performed to assess the repeatability and the accuracy of this method. Target registration error is measured on multiple visual and radio-opaque landmarks to evaluate the accuracy of the registration. Mixed reality visualizations from arbitrary angles are also presented for simulated orthopedic surgeries. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first calibration method which uses only tomographic and RGBD reconstructions. This means that the method does not impose a particular shape of the phantom. We demonstrate a marker-less calibration of CBCT volumes and 3D depth cameras, achieving reasonable registration accuracy. This design requires a one-time factory calibration, is self-contained, and could be integrated into existing mobile C-arms to provide real-time augmented reality views from arbitrary angles.	alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma;augmented reality;ct scan;calibration;coat of arms;cone-beam computed tomography;contain (action);detectors;experiment;imagery;iterative closest point;iterative method;mixed reality;operative surgical procedures;orthopedics;pet/ct scan;patients;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;radiography;real-time clock;real-time web;repeatability;algorithm;registration - actclass	Sing Chun Lee;Bernhard Fuerst;Javad Fotouhi;Marius Fischer;Greg Osgood;Nassir Navab	2016	International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery	10.1007/s11548-016-1396-1	computer vision;augmented reality;x-ray image intensifier;radiology;medicine;computer science;medical physics;computer graphics (images)	Vision	41.264728488809475	-84.69719055642297	96883

The purpose of this study was to induce spiral waves by an electrical stimulation of cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes using a microelectrode arrays technology. In basal conditions, cardiac muscle cells in monolayer culture displayed a planar wavefront propagation. External electrical impulse trains induced severe arrhythmia and spiral waves appeared. This in vitro generation of spiral wave opens a new way to test the anti-arrhythmic drugs and for strategies at microscopically scale.	functional electrical stimulation;spiral wave	Sabir Jacquir;Stéphane Binczak;Binbin Xu;Gabriel Laurent;D.

01df633e9851cb1cd781ade7fed9b6b1fdfbb5d9	crowdsourcing for identification of polyp-free segments in virtual colonoscopy videos	colon;virtual colonoscopy;video	Virtual colonoscopy (VC) allows a physician to virtually navigate within a reconstructed 3D colon model searching for colorectal polyps. Though VC is widely recognized as a highly sensitive and specific test for identifying polyps, one limitation is the reading time, which can take over 30 minutes per patient. Large amounts of the colon are often devoid of polyps, and a way of identifying these polyp-free segments could be of valuable use in reducing the required reading time for the interrogating radiologist. To this end, we have tested the ability of the collective crowd intelligence of non-expert workers to identify polyp candidates and polyp-free regions. We presented twenty short videos flying through a segment of a virtual colon to each worker, and the crowd was asked to determine whether or not a possible polyp was observed within that video segment. We evaluated our framework on Amazon Mechanical Turk and found that the crowd was able to achieve a sensitivity of 80.0% and specificity of 86.5% in identifying video segments which contained a clinically proven polyp. Since each polyp appeared in multiple consecutive segments, all polyps were in fact identified. Using the crowd results as a first pass, 80% of the video segments could in theory be skipped by the radiologist, equating to a significant time savings and enabling more VC examinations to be performed.	amazon mechanical turk;colon classification;crowdsourcing;radiology;sensitivity and specificity;the turk;vc dimension;virtual colonoscopy	Ji Hwan Park;Seyedkoosha Mirhosseini;Saad Nadeem;Joseph Marino;Arie E.

Yet, the current optoacoustic image reconstruction methods are usually based on inaccurate forward modelling approaches or otherwise demand a high computational cost, which imposes certain practical limitations and hinders image quantification. Herein, we introduce a new method for accelerating optoacoustic reconstructions, based on angular image discretization of the forward model solution. The method is particularly suitable for accurate image reconstruction with arbitrary meshes and space-dependent resolution, while it can also readily account for small speed of sound variations without compromising the calculation speed. It is further anticipated that the new approach will greatly facilitate development of high performance 3-D optoacoustic reconstruction methods.	algorithmic efficiency;angularjs;ct scan;discretization;dynamic imaging;image quantification;iterative reconstruction;preclinical imaging;quantitation;tomography	X.

2a1b3d741812e35d6099ef580e3780940f0175c2	pose-induced effects of femur and tibia on accuracy of model-based radiostereometric analysis		AbstractThe radiostereometric analysis (RSA) technique has been used to monitor intercomponent position and polyethylene wear after total knee arthroplasty. RSA uses anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) X-ray images to predict the three-dimensional (3D) relationship of prostheses. However, overlapping images can potentially reduce the accuracy of the predicted RSA results. Overlapping images often occur from improper poses of the lower limb. This study evaluates the pose-induced errors of knee, ankle and hip joints by taking simulated X-ray images of knee prosthesis. The poses include knee flexion only, knee/dorsal flexion, knee flexion and hip abduction and knee/dorsal flexion and hip abduction. Predicted RSA accuracy and pose-induced effects on the overlapping images are evaluated. Two comparison indices are chosen among the poses: percentage of image overlap and rotational and translational RSA errors. The results show that dorsal flexion induces more image overlap than knee flexion.

A new method using digital subtraction angiographic images of a personal computer-image display terminal interfaced to our picture archiving and communication system (PACS) performs measurements and calculations of the coordinates of the location of the center of the lesion to be treated. The time required to calculate the coordinates was performed by three methods: hand calculation, digitizer method, and PACS method. These three coordinates were compared in 10 cases. The hand calculation method required ≈50 minutes, the digitizer method required ≈10 minutes, and the PACS method ≈3 minutes. The difference is statistically significant (P<.001). The three methods were equally accurate. This type of PACS application using inexpensive personal computers interfaced more directly to a PACS is an emerging trend that facilitates wider access to images and to manipulating them for specialized applications.	archive;computer monitor;digitizer device component;neoplasms;personal computers;personal computer;picture archiving and communication system;radiosurgery;therapeutic radiology procedure;stereotactic imaging	Tooru Shiga;Hiroki Shirato;Yoichi Kikuchi;Takeshi Nishioka;Toshihiro Kitahara;Satoshi Terae;Noriaki Nishiyama;Xu Bo;Kazuo Miyasaka	1996	Journal of Digital Imaging	10.1007/BF03168606	computer vision;simulation;radiology;medicine;computer science;statistical significance;picture archiving and communication system;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	39.34603369343442	-87.9512785042263	97351

Since its quantitative correction is often difficult, we propose here a qualitative method to compare the real study to virtual images of the patient, obtained as if he/she was healthy. Method: The virtual images are obtained coregistering the magnetic resonance images to SPECT's; segmenting magnetic resonance images to obtain the real shape and position of caudates and putamens; digitally filling these volumes with an activity concentration close to normal condition; blurring and convolving images with the measured point-spread function of the SPECT system. Result: The method was applied to phantom and, retrospectively, to a small cohort of 20 patients, that underwent SPECT examination more than 3 years ago, to prove the feasibility of the method in a clinical environment. Conclusions: This method enhances the accuracy of the nuclear medicine interpretation by the inclusion of the proper morphological information of each patient, helping the physician to differentiate between partial-volume effects and real hypofixation of the tracer. The method proved to be feasible but is applicability is fostered by the need of a concomitant MR. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

It has been claimed that renal biopsy can provide a link between diagnosis of renal disease and its pathological conditions. However, sometimes there is a considerable mismatch between patient renal outcome and pathological findings in renal biopsy. This is the time to address some new diagnostic methods to resolve the insufficiency of conventional percutaneous guided renal biopsy. Nanotechnology is still in its infancy in renal imaging; however, it seems that it is the next step in renal biopsy, providing solutions to the limitations of conventional modalities.	convergence insufficiency;kidney diseases;kidney biopsy;patients;solutions	Hamid Tayebi Khosroshahi;Behzad Abedi;Sabalan Daneshvar;Yashar Sarbaz;Abolhassan Shakeri Bavil	2017		10.1155/2017/6141734	radiology;medicine;pathology;surgery	HCI	35.549091194579674	-83.93177310348976	97412

We show that decorrelation between tissue motion and intensity variation is inevitable for certain kinds of tissue motion and decorrelation compensation is an ill-posed inverse problem if the decorrelation is beyond a certain correlation threshold. We compare the performance of different features using simulations and phantom examples. We find a threshold value of correlation coefficients below which the B-Mode signal works better than the radio frequency (RF) signal in the analysis of large deformation. We also demonstrate that the introduction of a quantitative reliability measure helps to improve the robustness of displacement estimation.	coefficient;computational human phantom;decorrelation;displacement mapping;genetic algorithm;ground truth;lateral computing;lateral thinking;radio frequency;simulation;video-in video-out;well-posed problem	Weichuan Yu;Ping Yan;Albert J.

One hundred patients with a clinical suspicion of abdominopelvic hemorrhage that underwent biphasic CT imaging were retrospectively read by two readers on a dedicated reading display (reference standard) and on a tablet computer (iPad Air). Reading was performed in a dedicated reading room with ambient light conditions. Image evaluation included signs of an active hemorrhage (extravasation of contrast media) and different signs indicating a condition after abdominopelvic hemorrhage (hematoma, intestinal clots, vessel stump, free abdominopelvic fluid with a mean Hounsfield unit value >20, and asymmetric muscle volume indicating intramuscular hemorrhage). Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV/NPV) were calculated for the tablet-based reading. Active abdominopelvic hemorrhage (n = 72) was diagnosed with the tablet computer with a sensitivity of 0.96, a specificity of 0.93, a PPV of 0.97, and an NPV of 0.90. The results for the detection of the signs indicating a condition after abdominopelvic hemorrhage range from 0.83 to 1.00 in the case of sensitivity, from 0.95 to 1.00 in the case of specificity, from 0.94 to 1.00 in the case of the PPV, and from 0.96 to 1.00 in the case of the NPV. Abdominopelvic hemorrhage shown on CT images can be diagnosed on a tablet computer with a high diagnostic accuracy allowing mobile on-call diagnoses. This may be helpful because an early and reliable diagnosis at any time is crucial for an adequate treatment strategy.	amputation stumps;benign lymphatic vessel neoplasm;blood clot;blood vessel tissue;ct scan;contrast media;decision stump;extravasation;hounsfield unit;intestinal atresia;muscle hematoma;nucleopolyhedrovirus;patients;prostate stromal proliferation of uncertain malignant potential;reference standards;sensitivity and specificity;subarachnoid hemorrhage;tablet computer;x-ray computed tomography;ipad	Philipp Martin Schlechtweg;Ferdinand Josef Kammerer;Hannes Seuss;Michael Uder;Matthias Hammon	2015	Journal of Digital Imaging	10.1007/s10278-015-9829-x	text mining;medical research;radiology;medicine;pathology;computer science;surgery	Vision	35.67073130824481	-81.44959886487331	98032

For this procedure, skin is cut into flaps that are stretched to cover openings in the face. Thus, the model must recreate the visual, haptic, and force feedback expected by the surgeon. To develop the FE model, a series of in vitro experiments were conducted on samples of human skin, subjected to uniaxial and planar tensile straining. Reduced polynomial hyperelastic (HE) materials were found to fit many of the samples' stress-strain data well. Finally, an explicit dynamic FE mesh was developed based on the fitted HE material models. A total Lagrangian formulation with the half-step central difference method was employed to integrate the dynamic equation of motion of the mesh. The mesh was integrated into two versions of a real-time skin simulator: a single-threaded version running on a computer's main central processing unit and a multithreaded version running on the computer's graphics card. The latter was achieved by exploiting recent advances in programmable graphics technology.	64-bit computing;align (company);central processing unit;expansion card;experiment;facial recognition system;finite difference;finite element method;graphics processing unit;haptic device component;haptic technology;image resolution;in vitro [publication type];microscopes;multithreading (computer architecture);numerical analysis;operative surgical procedures;polynomial;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;scanning;seizures;simulation;skin neoplasms;skin structure of abdomen;stress ball;surgical flaps;thread (computing);tomography;tomography, optical coherence;version;video card;video-in video-out	Rudy J.

We present the results of two phantom studies using our navigation system in a clinical environment. In the first study, a physician and medical resident performed a total of 18 targeting passes in the abdomen of an anthropomorphic phantom based solely upon image guidance. The distance between the target and needle tip location was measured based on confirmatory scans which gave an average of 3.56 mm. In the second study, three foam nodules were placed at different depths in a gelatin phantom. Ten targeting passes were attempted in each of the three depths. Final distances between the target and needle tip were measured which gave an average of 3.00 mm. In addition to these targeting studies, we discuss our refinement to the standard four-quadrant image-guided navigation user interface, based on clinician preferences. We believe these refinements increase the usability of our system while decreasing targeting error.	open-source software;phantom reference	Ralph Lin;Peng Cheng;David Lindisch;Filip Banovac;Justin Z Lee;Kevin Cleary	2008		10.1117/12.771254	computer vision;simulation;engineering;biological engineering	SE	40.02339431260319	-84.73896199833771	98230

Inhomogeneous finite-element models were developed, incorporating a distributed dispersive electrode-tissue interface and encapsulation tissue of high and low conductivity, under both current-controlled and voltage-controlled stimulation. The models were used to assess the accuracy of capacitive models, where material properties were estimated at a single frequency, with respect to the full dispersive models. The effect of incorporating dispersion in the electrical conductivity and relative permittivity was found to depend on both the applied stimulus and the encapsulation tissue surrounding the electrode. Under current-controlled stimulation, and during voltage-controlled stimulation when the electrode was surrounded by high-resistivity encapsulation tissue, the dispersive material properties of the tissue were found to influence the voltage waveform in the tissue, indicated by RMS errors between the capacitive and dispersive models of 20%-38% at short pulse durations. When the dispersive model was approximated by a capacitive model, the accuracy of estimates of the volume of tissue activated was very sensitive to the frequency at which material properties were estimated. When material properties at 1 kHz were used, the error in the volume of tissue activated by capacitive approximations was reduced to -4.33% and 11.10%, respectively, for current-controlled and voltage-controlled stimulations, with higher errors observed when higher or lower frequencies were used.

29c04ea7f9776d92b2a66940cf967005dfa309d2	sparse reconstruction of compressive sensing mri using cross-domain stochastically fully connected conditional random fields	imaging radiology	BACKGROUND Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a crucial medical imaging technology for the screening and diagnosis of frequently occurring cancers. However, image quality may suffer from long acquisition times for MRIs due to patient motion, which also leads to patient discomfort. Reducing MRI acquisition times can reduce patient discomfort leading to reduced motion artifacts from the acquisition process. Compressive sensing strategies applied to MRI have been demonstrated to be effective in decreasing acquisition times significantly by sparsely sampling the k-space during the acquisition process. However, such a strategy requires advanced reconstruction algorithms to produce high quality and reliable images from compressive sensing MRI.   METHODS This paper proposes a new reconstruction approach based on cross-domain stochastically fully connected conditional random fields (CD-SFCRF) for compressive sensing MRI. The CD-SFCRF introduces constraints in both k-space and spatial domains within a stochastically fully connected graphical model to produce improved MRI reconstruction.   RESULTS Experimental results using T2-weighted (T2w) imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of the prostate show strong performance in preserving fine details and tissue structures in the reconstructed images when compared to other tested methods even at low sampling rates.   CONCLUSIONS The ability to better utilize a limited amount of information to reconstruct T2w and DWI images in a short amount of time while preserving the important details in the images demonstrates the potential of the proposed CD-SFCRF framework as a viable reconstruction algorithm for compressive sensing MRI.	algorithm;cd-rom;compressed sensing;conditional random field;diffusion weighted imaging;display resolution;graphical model;image quality;imaging phantom;imaging technology;magnetic resonance imaging;malaise;malignant neoplasms;medical imaging;morphologic artifacts;patients;peak signal-to-noise ratio;phantoms, imaging;prostatic neoplasms;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;sparse;sparse matrix	Edward Li;Farzad Khalvati;Mohammad Javad Shafiee;Masoom A.

One approach taken in recent neuroprosthetic design is to use a multi-input, multi-output device that reads data from the CA3 in the hippocampus and electrically stimulates the CA1 in an attempt to mimic the appropriate firing pattern that would occur naturally between the two areas. However, further study needs to be conducted in order to optimize electrode placement, pulse magnitude, and shape for creating the appropriate firing pattern. This paper describes the creation and implementation of an anatomically correct 3D model of the hippocampus to simulate the electric field patterns and axonal activation from electrical stimulation due to an implanted electrode array. The activating function was applied to the voltage results to determine the firing patterns in possible axon locations within the CA1.	activating function;axon;brain injuries;ca1 field;ca3 field;computation (action);computational model;electric countershock;electric stimulation technique;electricity;electrodes, implanted;functional electrical stimulation;implants;neuroprosthetics;numerous;output device;prosthesis;reading (activity);simulation;voltage	Andrew Gilbert;Kyle Loizos;Anil Kumar RamRakhyani;Phillip J.

Stereo-Electroencephalography (SEEG) is mainly used to localize the epileptogenic zone and a precise knowledge of the location of the electrodes is expected to facilitate the recordings interpretation and the planning of resective surgery. However, the localization of intracerebral electrodes on post-implant acquisitions is usually time-consuming (i.e., manual segmentation), it requires advanced 3D visualization tools, and it needs the supervision of trained medical doctors in order to minimize the errors. In this paper we propose an automated segmentation algorithm specifically designed to segment SEEG contacts from a thresholded post-implant Cone-Beam CT volume (0.4 mm, 0.4 mm, 0.8 mm). The algorithm relies on the planned position of target and entry points for each electrode as a first estimation of electrode axis. We implemented the proposed algorithm into DEETO, an open source C++ prototype based on ITK library. We tested our implementation on a cohort of 28 subjects in total. The experimental analysis, carried out over a subset of 12 subjects (35 multilead electrodes; 200 contacts) manually segmented by experts, show that the algorithm: (i) is faster than manual segmentation (i.e., less than 1s/subject versus a few hours) (ii) is reliable, with an error of 0.5 mm ± 0.06 mm, and (iii) it accurately maps SEEG implants to their anatomical regions improving the interpretability of electrophysiological traces for both clinical and research studies. Moreover, using the 28-subject cohort we show here that the algorithm is also robust (error < 0.005 mm) against deep-brain displacements (< 12 mm) of the implanted electrode shaft from those planned before surgery. Our method represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first automatic algorithm for the segmentation of SEEG electrodes. The method can be used to accurately identify the neuroanatomical loci of SEEG electrode contacts by a non-expert in a fast and reliable manner.	algorithm;apache axis;brain implant;c++;ct scan;electrodes, implanted;electroencephalography;itk gene;imagery;implants;internationalization and localization;map;neurotrophic electrode;onset (audio);open-source software;patients;procedure implants:finding:point in time:^patient:narrative;prototype;seizures;shaft device component;subgroup;tomography, spiral computed;tracing (software);visualization (graphics);x-ray computed tomography;biologic segmentation	Gabriele Arnulfo;Massimo Narizzano;Francesco Cardinale;Marco Fato;Jaakko Palva	2015		10.1186/s12859-015-0511-6	stereoelectroencephalography;computer science;bioinformatics	Robotics	39.10158161296269	-83.98146370857995	99043

Measuring the thickness of structures from automatic probabilistic ume (PV) effects and the limited resolution of medical images. Also, the complexity of certain shapes, like the highly convoluted and PV ments. In this paper we explore the use of Khalimsky's cubic complex for the extraction of topologically correct thickness measurements from probabilistic or fuzzy segmentations without explicit parametrisation of the edge. A sequence of element collapse operations is used to correct the topology of the segmentation. The Laplace equation is then solved between multiple equipotential lines and the thickness measured with an ordered upwind differencing method using an anisotropic grid with the probabilistic segmentation as a speed function. Experiments performed on digital phantoms show that the proposed method obtains topologically correct thickness measurements with an increase in accuracy when compared to two well established techniques. Furthermore, quantitative analysis on brain MRI data showed that the proposed algorithm is able to retrieve expected group differences between the cortical thickness of AD patients and controls with high statistical significance.

The objective of most approaches studied in the literature consists in providing separate spatial maps and time signatures for the identified sources. However, for some applications, a precise localization of each source is required. To achieve this, a two-step approach has been proposed. The idea of this approach is to separate the sources using the canonical polyadic decomposition in the first step and to employ the results of the tensor decomposition to estimate distributed sources in the second step, using the so-called disk algorithm. In this paper, we propose to combine the tensor decomposition and the source localization in a single step. To this end, we directly impose structural constraints, which are based on a priori information on the possible source locations, on the factor matrix of spatial characteristics. The resulting optimization problem is solved using the alternating direction method of multipliers, which is incorporated in the alternating least squares tensor decomposition algorithm. Realistic simulations with epileptic EEG data confirm that the proposed single-step source localization approach outperforms the previously developed two-step approach.	algorithm;augmented lagrangian method;computer simulation;electroencephalography;electronic signature;least squares;map;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;run time (program lifecycle phase)	Hanna Becker;Ahmad Karfoul;Laurent Albera;Rémi Gribonval;Julien Fleureau;Philippe Guillotel;Amar Kachenoura;Lotfi Senhadji;Isabelle Merlet	2015	2015 IEEE 6th International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)	10.1109/CAMSAP.2015.7383766	mathematical optimization;theoretical computer science;machine learning;mathematics	Vision	50.218948569387855	-80.6379189735053	99541

For reconstructing a three-dimensional representation of an extraocular eye muscle, a sufficient amount of high resolution MR images is used, each representing a slice of the muscle. In addition, threshold values are given, which restrict the amount of data used from the MR images. The Marching Cube algorithm is applied to the polygons, resulting in a 3D representation of the muscle, which can efficiently be rendered. A transformation to a dynamic, deformable model is applied by calculating the center of gravity of each muscle slice, approximating the muscle path and subsequently adding Hermite splines through the centers of gravity of all slices. Then, a radius function is defined for each slice, completing the transformation of the static 3D polygon model. Finally, this paper describes future extensions to our system. One of these extensions is the support for additional calculations and measurements within the reconstructed 3D muscle representation. Globe translation, localization of muscle pulleys by analyzing the 3D reconstruction in two different gaze positions and other diagnostic measurements will be available.© (2003) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

860cfac4a641de73791873b6182de8df2ddd0d85	3-d reconstruction in canonical co-ordinate space from arbitrarily oriented 2-d images		Limited capture range, and the requirement to provide high quality initialization for optimization-based 2-D/3-D image registration methods, can significantly degrade the performance of 3-D image reconstruction and motion compensation pipelines. Challenging clinical imaging scenarios, which contain significant subject motion, such as fetal in-utero imaging, complicate the 3-D image and volume reconstruction process. In this paper, we present a learning-based image registration method capable of predicting 3-D rigid transformations of arbitrarily oriented 2-D image slices, with respect to a learned canonical atlas co-ordinate system. Only image slice intensity information is used to perform registration and canonical alignment, no spatial transform initialization is required. To find image transformations, we utilize a convolutional neural network architecture to learn the regression function capable of mapping 2-D image slices to a 3-D canonical atlas space. We extensively evaluate the effectiveness of our approach quantitatively on simulated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fetal brain imagery with synthetic motion and further demonstrate qualitative results on real fetal MRI data where our method is integrated into a full reconstruction and motion compensation pipeline. Our learning based registration achieves an average spatial prediction error of 7 mm on simulated data and produces qualitatively improved reconstructions for heavily moving fetuses with gestational ages of approximately 20 weeks. Our model provides a general and computationally efficient solution to the 2-D/3-D registration initialization problem and is suitable for real-time scenarios.	algorithmic efficiency;artificial neural network;atlases;cervical atlas;convolutional neural network;display resolution;fetus;gestational age;graphics pipeline;guided imagery;image registration;iterative reconstruction;magnetic resonance imaging;mathematical optimization;medical imaging;motion compensation;muscle rigidity;network architecture;neural network simulation;real-time clock;synthetic intelligence;uterus;cell transformation;registration - actclass	Benjamin Hou;Bishesh Khanal;Amir Alansary;Steven McDonagh;Alice Davidson;Mary Rutherford;Joseph V.

fba9c7afce59dd6aed09ea0258af5bded6d4928a	joint reconstruction of white-matter pathways from longitudinal diffusion mri data with anatomical priors	diffusion mri;longitudinal data analysis;tractography	We consider the problem of reconstructing white-matter pathways in a longitudinal study, where diffusion-weighted and T1-weighted MR images have been acquired at multiple time points for the same subject. We propose a method for joint reconstruction of a subject's pathways at all time points given the subject's entire set of longitudinal data. We apply a method for unbiased within-subject registration to generate a within-subject template from the T1-weighted images of the subject at all time points. We follow a global probabilistic tractography approach, where the unknown pathway is represented in the space of this within-subject template and propagated to the native space of the diffusion-weighted images at all time points to compute its posterior probability given the images. This ensures spatial correspondence of the reconstructed pathway among time points, which in turn allows longitudinal changes in diffusion measures to be estimated consistently along the pathway. We evaluate the reliability of the proposed method on data from healthy controls scanned twice within a month, where no changes in white-matter microstructure are expected between scans. We evaluate the sensitivity of the method on data from Huntington's disease patients scanned repeatedly over the course of several months, where changes are expected between scans. We show that reconstructing white-matter pathways jointly using the data from all time points leads to improved reliability and sensitivity, when compared to reconstructing the pathways at each time point independently.	anisotropic diffusion;clinical use template;gene regulatory network;huntington disease;parkinson disease;patients;scanning;registration - actclass	Anastasia Yendiki;Martin Reuter;Paul Wilkens;H.

Today, the geometry of intracranial aneurysms is typically quantified manually based on three-dimensional (3D) Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) images. Since the repeatability of manual measurements is not guaranteed and their accuracy is dependent on the experience of the treating physician, we propose a semi-automated approach for computer-aided measurement of these parameters. In particular, a tubular deformable model, initialized based on user-provided points, is first fit to the surface of the parent artery. An initial estimate of the aneurysmal segment is obtained based on differences between the two surfaces. A 3D deformable contour model is then used to localize the aneurysmal neck and to separate its dome surface from the parent artery. Finally, approaches for estimation of the clinically relevant geometric parameters are applied based on the aneurysmal neck and dome surface. Results on 19 3D DSA datasets of saccular aneurysms indicate that, for the maximum diameter, the standard deviation of the difference between the proposed approach and two independent manual sets of measurements obtained by expert readers is similar to the inter-rater standard deviation. For the neck length and dome height, the results improve considerably if we exclude datasets with high deviation from the manual measurements.	format-preserving encryption;image segmentation;repeatability;semiconductor industry	Ashraf Mohamed;Eleni Sgouritsa;Hesham Morsi;Hashem Shaltoni;Michel E.

With the technology of C-arm CT it is possible to reconstruct static intraprocedural 3D images from angiographic projection data. Current approaches attempt to add the temporal dimension (4D). In the assumption of periodic heart motion, ECG-gating techniques can be used. However, arrhythmic heart signals and slight breathing motion are degrading image quality frequently. To overcome those problems, we present a reconstruction method based on a 4D time-continuous B-spline motion field. The temporal component of the motion field is parameterized by the acquisition time and does not assume a periodic heart motion. The analytic dynamic FDK-reconstruction formula is used directly for the motion estimation and image reconstruction. In a physical phantom experiment two vessels of size 3.1mm and 2.3mm were reconstructed using the proposed method and an algorithm with periodicity assumption. For a periodic motion both methods obtained an error of 0.1mm. For a non-periodic motion the proposed method was superior, obtaining an error of 0.3mm/0.2mm in comparison to 1.2mm/1.0mm for the algorithm with periodicity assumption. For a clinical test case of a left coronary artery it could be further shown that the method is capable to produce diameter measurements with an absolute error of 0.1mm compared to state-of-the-art measurement tools from orthogonal coronary angiography. Further, it is shown for three different clinical cases (left/right coronary artery, coronary sinus) that the proposed method is able to handle a large variability of vascular structures and motion patterns. The complete algorithm is hardware-accelerated using the GPU requiring a computation time of less than 3min for typical clinical scenarios.

81a17a4f821a3c6aa8089dce9b796bb34a468ec1	registration of atrium models to c-arm x-ray images based on devices inside the coronary sinus and the esophagus		For augmented fluoroscopy in the context of minimally invasive EP procedures, a patient-specific model of the atrium segmented from a 3-D volume can be overlaid on fluoroscopic images. This requires a registration between the 3-D model coordinate system and the coordinate system of the C-arm X-ray device. We propose an indirect registration that makes use of surrounding anatomical structures that can be segmented both in the 3-D volume obtained by CT or MRI and also in fluoroscopic images. More precisely, the coronary sinus and the esophagus segmented from the 3-D volume is registered to reconstructed 3-D devices which are located in the respective structures during the intervention.

095ada51f18f3e79aaf1bbea57987b0aa9097f70	fast parameter-free region growing segmentation with application to surgical planning	surgical planning;virtual reality;segmentation;region growing	In this paper, we propose a self-assessed adaptive region growing segmentation algorithm. In the context of an experimental virtual-reality surgical planning software platform, our method successfully delineates main tissues relevant for reconstructive surgery, such as fat, muscle, and bone. We rely on a self-tuning approach to deal with a great variety of imaging conditions requiring limited user intervention (one seed). The detection of the optimal parameters is managed internally using a measure of the varying contrast of the growing region, and the stopping criterion is adapted to the noise level in the dataset thanks to the sampling strategy used for the assessment function. Sampling is referred to the statistics of a neighborhood around the seed(s), so that the sampling period becomes greater when images are noisier, resulting in the acquisition of a lower frequency version of the contrast function. Validation is provided for synthetic images, as well as real CT datasets. For the CT test images, validation is referred to manual delineations for 10 cases and to subjective assessment for another 35. High values of sensitivity and specificity, as well as Dice’s coefficient and Jaccard’s index on one hand, and satisfactory subjective evaluation on the other hand, prove the robustness of our contrast-based measure, even suggesting suitability for calibration of other region-based segmentation algorithms.	algorithm;coefficient;jaccard index;noise (electronics);region growing;sampling (signal processing);self-tuning;sensitivity and specificity;synthetic intelligence;virtual reality	Carlos S.

A three dimensional CAC volume contains significant clinically relevant information, which is unused by conventional whole-heart CAC quantification methods. In this paper, we have developed a more detailed distance-weighted lesion-specific CAC quantification framework that predicts cardiac events better than the conventional whole-heart CAC measures. This framework consists of (1) a novel lesion-specific CAC quantification tool that measures each calcific lesion's attenuation, morphologic and geometric statistics; (2) a distance-weighted event risk model to estimate the risk probability caused by each lesion, and (3) a Naive Bayesian technique for risk integration. We have tested our lesion-specific event predictor on 30 CAC positive scans (10 with events and 20 without events), and compared it with conventional whole-heart CAC scores. Experiment results showed our novel approach significantly improves the prediction accuracy, including AUC of ROC analysis was improved from 66 ∼ 68% to 75%, and sensitivities was improved by 20 ∼ 30% at the cutpoints of 80% specificity.	common access card;financial risk modeling;kerrison predictor;receiver operating characteristic;sensitivity and specificity	Zhen Qian;Idean Marvasty;Hunt Anderson;Sarah Rinehart;Szilard Voros	2009	2009 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro	10.1109/ISBI.2009.5193027	radiology;medicine;calcium;pathology;computed tomography;cardiology	Visualization	35.411479765081836	-80.40371408296906	101809

Here, we compare stimuli controlled by displacement and force, and analyze the impact on firing rates of slowly adapting type I afferents as skin thickness and elasticity change. Uniaxial compression tests were used to measure the mechanical properties of mouse hind limb skin (n=5), resulting in a range of skin thickness measurements (211.6-530.6 μm) and hyper- and visco-elastic properties (average coefficient of variation=0.27). Values were integrated to an axisymmetric finite element model using an Ogden strain energy function. This calculated the propagation of surface loads to tactile end-organ locations, where maximum compressive stress and its rate were sampled and linearly regressed to firing rate. For the observed range of skin thickness, firing response was predicted under both force and displacement control of a ramp-and-hold stimulus. Over the ramp phase of stimulation, the variance in predicted firing rate was higher under displacement than under force control (22.2 versus 4.9 Hz) with a similar trend in the sustained phase of stimulation (4.6 versus 1.3 Hz). Given that skin thickness varies significantly between specimens, for human skin perhaps even more so than for mice, the use of force control is predicted to decrease experimental variance in neurophysiological and psychophysical responses.	cd96 gene;coefficient;compression;displacement mapping;elasticity (data store);finite element method;hertz (hz);hyperactive behavior;lower extremity;mathematical optimization;psychologic displacement;ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability;sample variance;skin (computing);software propagation;specimen;thickness (graph theory);touch sensation	Yuxiang Wang;Kara L.

The cor-rective osteotomy of the thigh bone is used for changing the posture of the hip joint. During surgery, a small cross-sectional slice is cut out of the thigh bone by the use of a sawing device. Our system supports the planning phase of this surgery by allowing interactive visualizations of the cutting planes using a 3D surface-oriented model of the thigh bone derived from computer tomography (CT). It also supports the actual surgery, in which a robot hand is steered towards the predetermined cutting planes, a process that is guided and monitored by a vision system.	automated planning and scheduling;ct scan;cross-sectional data;poor posture;robot;tomography	Jose Moctezuma;Jost Bernasch;Gabriele Lohmann;Achim Schweikard;Frank Gosse	1994		10.1109/IROS.1994.407490	robot;computer vision;robotic surgery;interactive visualization;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;cross section;biological engineering;tomography;user interface;cutting-plane method	Robotics	39.91932516086114	-85.46675540483088	102032

The hybrid system consists of a tracking unit directly placed on the patient's pelvis, an augmented marker with an integrated inertial measurement unit ('MU) attached to the patient's acetabular fragment and the host computer. The tracking unit sends a live video stream of the marker to the host computer where the marker's pose is estimated. The augmented marker with the 'MU sends its pose estimate to the host computer where we apply sensor fusion to compute the final marker pose estimate. The host computer then tracks the orientation of the acetabular fragment during peri-acetabular osteotomy surgery. Anatomy registration is done using a previously developed registration device. A Kalman filter-based sensor fusion was added to complete the system. A plastic bone study was performed for validation between an optical tracking-based navigation system and our proposed system. Mean absolute difference for inclination and anteversion was 1.63 degrees and 1.55 degrees, respectively. The results show that our system is able to accurately measure the orientation of the acetabular fragment.

The spectrum parameters obtained from photoacoustic spectrum analysis (PASA) have been found to have the relationship with tissue microstructure. However, the effects of transducer positions on PASA have not been studied yet. A simplified 2-D simulation model is presented using Monte Carlo method and finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method to detect PA signals from various transducer positions generated by microspheres with certain radius which have uniformly random positions within the region of interest. PASA is applied and the spectral slope from different distances and angles is extracted and compared with that from microspheres of different radius but at the same positions. It finds that PA spectral slope extracted from some angles show better relationship with dimensions of the microspheres than that from other angles. While changing the detection radius does not have a significant effect on the result.	finite-difference time-domain method;medical imaging;medical ultrasound;monte carlo method;region of interest;simulation;spectral slope;transducer	Zhongjing Wang;Yuanyuan Wang	2015	2015 8th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics (BMEI)	10.1109/BMEI.2015.7401489	calibration;transducer;optics;nuclear magnetic resonance;statistics;monte carlo method	Visualization	46.33853653988314	-85.25108180535636	102523

The Geselowitz relation is applied to murine and multisegment conductance catheters using finite element models to determine the spatial sensitivity in a uniform medium and simplified left ventricle models. A new formulation is proposed that allows determination of the spatial sensitivity to admittance. Analysis of FEM numerical modeling results using the Geselowitz relation provides a true measure of parallel conductance in simplified left ventricle models for assessment of the admittance method and hypertonic saline techniques. The spatial sensitivity of blood conductance (Gb) is determined throughout the cardiac cycle. Gb is converted to volume using Wei's equation to determine if the presence of myocardium alters the nonlinear relationship through changes to the electric field. Results show that muscle conductance (Gm) from the admittance method matches results from the Geselowitz relation and that the relationship between Gb and volume is accurately fit using Wei's equation. Single-segment admittance measurements in large animals result in a more evenly distributed sensitivity to the LV blood pool. The hypertonic saline method overestimates parallel conductance throughout the cardiac cycle in both murine and multisegment conductance catheters.	conductance (graph);finite element method;gentamicins;heart ventricle;left ventricular structure;logical volume management;muscle;myocardium;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;pool (computer science);saline solution, hypertonic;salineos;salt-tolerant plants	Erik R.

Heated gutta-percha was used to mark 13 specific distances on a human skull, and the distances were directly measured using a digital caliper and on CBCT images obtained with Iluma (3M Imtec, OK, USA) and 3D Accuitomo 170 (3D Accuitomo; J Morita Mfg. Corp., Kyoto, Japan) CBCT imaging systems. Iluma images were obtained at 120 kVp and 3.8 mA and reconstructed using voxel sizes of 0.2 and 0.3 mm3. Accuitomo images were obtained at 60 kVp and 2 mA and a voxel size of 0.250 mm3. In addition, 3-D reconstructions were produced from images obtained from both systems. All measurements were made independently by three trained observers and were repeated after an interval of 1 week. Agreement between observers and image type was assessed by calculating Pearson correlation coefficients, with a level of significance set at p < 0.05. Pearson correlation coefficients between readings ranged from 0.995 to 1 for all image types. Correlations among observers were also very high, ranging from 0.992 to 1 for the first reading and from 0.992 to 1 for the second reading for the different image types. All CBCT image measurements were identical and highly correlated with digital caliper measurements. Accuracy of measurements of various distances on a human skull obtained from different CBCT units and image types is comparable to that of digital caliper measurements.	caliper;coefficient;cone-beam computed tomography;cubic millimeter;distance;gutta-percha;reading (activity);voxel size;corporation;observers	Kivanç Kamburoglu;Eray Kolsuz;Hakan Kurt;Cenk Kiliç;Tuncer Özen;Candan Semra Paksoy	2010	Journal of Digital Imaging	10.1007/s10278-010-9339-9	cephalometry;pathology;nuclear medicine;medical physics	Graphics	37.798443491233094	-82.77863701495315	102810

Three dimensional mass models had been developed earlier and were validated for the realism of their appearance after simulation into 2D and tomosynthesis patient images. Based on the feedback of the readers and the results of the simulations of the earlier study we initiated the present study in which we investigated the effect of insertion position and background glandular tissue estimation on the appearance of these masses. A subset of these masses was re-simulated in another position and using a different background estimator. These simulated masses were subsequently evaluated by an experienced radiologist on a 5-point scale realism score. The results showed that the insertion position of simulated masses is a significant factor in the appearance of realism of these masses and careful choices should be made.	simulation;tomosynthesis	Eman Shaheen;Frédéric Bemelmans;Chantal Van Ongeval;Frederik De Keyzer;Nausikaä Geeraert;Hilde Bosmans	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-07887-8_74	radiology;medical physics	Vision	38.66865689087384	-82.4686235703671	103122

However these procedures are considered of invasive nature, as they involve the injection of radioactive markers. On the other hand, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is perhaps the most widely used and less invasive medical imaging technique, although its ability to detect Alzheimer's Disease has revealed limited. In this paper, a new method that simplifies the process of analysing 3D MRI brain images using a two dimensional projection is proposed. Our system outperforms other methods that use MRI, achieving up to a 86% of accuracy and significantly reducing the computational load. Additionally, it allows the visual analysis and interpretation of the images, which can be of great help in the diagnosis of this and other types of dementia.	alzheimer's disease;computation;computational complexity theory;dementia;magnetic resonance imaging;medical imaging;molecular imaging;neurodegenerative disorders;radioactivity	Francisco Jesús Martínez-Murcia;Juan Manuel Górriz;Javier Ramírez;Ignacio Álvarez;Diego Salas-Gonzalez;Fermín Segovia	2014	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-474-9-225	data mining;pathology;computer-aided diagnosis;disease;medicine	Vision	35.88614103912596	-83.15119040496475	103850

Computed tomography angiography (CTA) provides high resolution, high contrast images of the thoracic cavity, and as such has emerged as the imaging modality of choice for diagnosing and planning treatment for coronary heart disease. However, radiologists and cardiac surgeons require tools to easily identify possible stenosis (narrowed or constricted coronary vessels) in such CTA datasets. We present a method which allows users to interactively visualise a specific three-dimensional region of interest (ROI). In our example, segmentation methods are applied to isolate the coronary vessels, which in turn are visually enhanced using various perceptual cues. The segmentation is achieved using a combination of thresholding, region-growing, and morphological operations. The perceptual enhancement is realized by fusing direct volume rendered images using weighting factors determined by the segmented regions. The user can allow for the easy dissemination of relevant information by adjusting ‘transfer functions’ to control the degree of ROI enhancement. This approach requires only roughly segmented regions of interest, and allows for the 3D visualisation of calcifications within vessels. This proposed method has significant potential for helping to facilitate the efficient treatment for coronary heart disease. Furthermore, it can be implemented at interactive framerates on comparatively cheap, desktop computing hardware making it readily accessible.	ct scan;computed tomography angiography;computer hardware;desktop computer;image resolution;interactivity;mathematical morphology;modality (human–computer interaction);radiology;region growing;region of interest;scientific visualization;visualization (graphics);volume rendering	Daniel Mueller;Anthony J.

This algorithm automatically recognizes bright focal spots in the conductivity map of the breast. Moreover, this algorithm discriminates between malignant and benign/normal tissues using two main predictors: phase at 5 kHz and crossover frequency, the frequency at which the imaginary part of the admittance is at its maximum. The thresholds for these predictors were adjusted using a learning group consisting of 83 carcinomas and 378 benign cases. In addition, the algorithm was verified on an independent test group including 87 carcinomas, 153 benign cases and 356 asymptomatic cases. Biopsy was used as gold standard for determining pathology in the symptomatic cases. A sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 52% were obtained for the test group.	algorithm;video post-processing	Yael A.

We notice that the computation of such histograms represents up to 90% of time of the whole process. We propose in this work a method to accelerate the computation of these histograms in the case of affine transformations, with a slight loss of accuracy. An analytical model of the new computation time allows us to find optimal parameters for a chosen precision and to predict the performance of the algorithm.

A 2D-GE image usually contains hundreds of protein spots that should be detected by an image processing technique. Identifying the missing proteins by comparison of two samples such as from healthy person and patient can be helpful in developing medicine or disease control. This matching process is a laborious work that needs to be automatically done by computers with less user intervention as much as possible. In this paper, we propose a two-step iterative registration algorithm for protein spots in 2D-GE images. The algorithm estimates the geometrical differences between the corresponding landmarks and iteratively moves the spot points in the matched gel in order to be closer to its correspondence in the reference gel. The amount of movement of each spot is affected by the Euclidian distances from the spot to all landmarks. The single-step matching is defined with its pros and cons; then the motivation to a two-step iterative registration algorithm and its results are discussed.	algorithm;computer;image processing;iterative method;matched filter;proteomics	Minh-Tuan T.

4c761fc37c72517bee16b05972fbb97fc4d3d114	cataract surgery performed by high frequency ldv z8 femtosecond laser: safety, efficacy, and its physical properties	cataract surgery;clinical outcomes;complications;femtosecond laser;physical properties	BACKGROUND The aim of our study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of the LDV Z8 femtosecond laser in cataract surgery compared to the conventional procedure.   METHODS This prospective study was performed at the Swiss Eye Research Foundation, Eye Clinic ORASIS, Reinach, Switzerland. The study included 130 eyes from 130 patients: 68 treated with femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) using the FEMTO LDV Z8 and 62 treated with conventional phacoemulsification. Capsulotomy and lens fragmentation in the laser group were performed with the FEMTO LDV Z8 femtosecond laser system, which employs a new, low-energy, high repetition rate laser process for cataract surgery. In the conventional group, the capsulotomy was performed by a cystotome, and lens fragmentation was achieved by the stop-and-chop.   RESULTS Ease of phacoemulsification (on a 4-point scale), the completeness of capsulotomy (on a 10-point scale), effective phacoemulsification time (seconds), uncorrected distance visual acuity (UCVA), best spectacle-corrected distance visual acuity (BSCVA), spherical equivalent (SE), and safety of the procedure were evaluated. The total follow-up time was three months.   CONCLUSIONS FLACS with the FEMTO LDV Z8 system was characterized by complete and reproducible capsulotomy and highly effective lens fragmentation. Postoperative visual outcomes were excellent, and the safety of the procedure was optimal.	area striata structure;bimalleolar fractures;cystotome;cataract;customize;eye neoplasms;eyeglasses;flacs;femto;fragmentation (computing);intraocular lymphoma;large;patients;phacoemulsification;prospective search;solutions;switzerland;uptime;z 008;zilog z8	Bojan Pajic;Zeljka Cvejic;Brigitte Pajic-Eggspuehler	2017		10.3390/s17061429	electronic engineering;ophthalmology;cataract surgery;engineering;distance visual acuity;phacoemulsification;laser;femtosecond;capsulotomy;laser safety;optics	HCI	34.70584886221868	-84.19499368083456	104883

Conventional video-CT registration is limited by the accuracy of the tracker and does not use the underlying video or CT image data. A new image-based video registration method has been developed to overcome the limitations of conventional tracker-based registration. This method adds to a navigation system based on intraoperative C-arm cone-beam CT (CBCT), in turn providing high-accuracy registration of video to the surgical scene. The resulting registration enables visualization of the CBCT and planning data within the endoscopic video. The system incorporates a mobile C-arm, integrated with an optical tracking system, video endoscopy, deformable registration of preoperative CT with intraoperative CBCT, and 3D visualization. Similarly to tracker-based approach, the image-based video-CBCT registration the endoscope is localized with optical tracking system followed by a direct 3D image-based registration of the video to the CBCT. In this way, the system achieves video-CBCT registration that is both fast and accurate. Application in skull-base surgery demonstrates overlay of critical structures (e.g., carotid arteries) and surgical targets with sub-mm accuracy. Phantom and cadaver experiments show consistent improvement of target registration error (TRE) in video overlay over conventional tracker-based registration-e.g., 0.92mm versus 1.82mm for image-based and tracker-based registration, respectively. The proposed method represents a two-fold advance-first, through registration of video to up-to-date intraoperative CBCT, and second, through direct 3D image-based video-CBCT registration, which together provide more confident visualization of target and normal tissues within up-to-date images.© (2011) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

127d6a5dde11cbff08ffbe2c028bb54ada9e27de	automated hippocampal segmentation by regional fluid registration of serial mri: validation and application in alzheimer's disease	clinical trial;gold standard;structural change;three dimensional;normal control;volume change	The application of voxel-level three-dimensional registration to serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is described. This fluid registration determines deformation fields modeling brain change, which are consistent with a model describing a viscous fluid. The objective was to validate the measurement of hippocampal volumetric change by fluid registration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) against current methodologies. The hippocampus was chosen for this study because it is difficult to measure reproducibly by manual segmentation and is widely studied; however, the technique is applicable to any structure which can be delineated on a scan. First, suitable values for the viscosity-body-force-ratio, alpha (0.01), and the number of iterations (300), were established and the convergence, repeatability, linearity, and accuracy investigated and compared with expert manual segmentation. A simple model of hippocampal atrophy was used to compare simulated volumetric change against that obtained by fluid registration. Finally the serial segmentation was compared with the current gold standard technique-expert human labeling with a volume repeatability of approximately 4%-in 27 subjects (15 normal controls, 12 clinically diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease). The scan-rescan volumetric consistency of serial segmentation by fluid-registration was shown to be superior to human serial segmentors ( approximately 2%). The mean absolute volume difference between fluid and manual segmentation was 0.7%. Fluid registration has potential importance for tracking longitudinal structural changes in brain particularly in the context of the clinical trial where large numbers of subjects may have multiple MR scans.	alzheimer's disease;atrophic;fltk;hippocampal replay;iteration;magnetic resonance imaging;optic atrophy, autosomal dominant;repeatability;voxel;biologic segmentation;registration - actclass	Rachael I.

While standard elastographic methods focus primarily on the visualization of soft and hard tissue regions as being indicative of tissue pathological changes, poroelastography allows imaging several novel parameters that are related to the tissue's effective compressibility and permeability. Medical areas where poroelastography could have a significant impact include cancer treatment imaging and lymphedema assessment. Despite compelling motivations driving the development of this novel modality, the current literature in this field is limited to a relatively small number of publications. These studies suggest the technical feasibility of poroelastography methods but do not comprehensively tackle fundamental issues of clinical importance. Image quality performance of poroelastography is still largely unknown. In this paper, we present the results of recent theoretical, simulation and experimental studies carried out in our laboratory, which address fundamental mechanical and noise limitations of various poroelastography techniques.	image quality;modality (human–computer interaction);simulation	Raffaella Righetti;Anuj Chaudhry;Sanjay P.

A novel weighting scheme is introduced, whereby the intensities of the MAR-corrected pixels are modified based on their spatial locations relative to the metal objects. Pixels falling within the straight-line regions connecting multiple metal objects are subjected to less intensive intensity-limiting, thereby compensating for the characteristic dark bands occurring in these regions. Extensive experimentation is performed on a state-of-the-art numerical simulation, a clinical CT data set and a baggage security CT data set. Comprehensive performance analysis, using reference and reference-free error metrics, Bland-Altman plots and visual comparisons, demonstrate an improvement in the restoration of the underestimated intensities occurring in the regions connecting multiple metal objects.	algorithm;bland's rule;ct scan;circuit restoration;numerical analysis;numerical weather prediction;pixel;profiling (computer programming);simulation;tomography	André Mouton;Najla Megherbi Bouallagu;Katrien Van Slambrouck;Johan Nuyts;Toby P.

Spherical statistics are preferred because of the 3D vectorial nature of the spatial error. Error vectors have three metric elements (one module and two angles) that were analyzed by spherical statistics. A study case has been presented and discussed in detail. Errors were calculating using 53 check points (CP) and CP coordinates were measured by a digitizer with submillimetre accuracy. The positional accuracy was analyzed by both the conventional method (modular errors analysis) and the proposed method (angular errors analysis) by 3D graphics and numerical spherical statistics. Two packages in R programming language were performed to obtain graphics automatically. The results indicated that the proposed method is advantageous as it offers a more complete analysis of the positional accuracy, such as angular error component, uniformity of the vector distribution, error isotropy, and error, in addition the modular error component by linear statistics.	3d computer graphics;angularjs;circuit complexity;digitizer device component;geographic coordinate system;graph - visual representation;numerical analysis;programming language;r language;scanning electron microscopy;terrestrial television	Aurora Cuartero;Julia Armesto;Pablo García Rodríguez;Pedro Arias	2010		10.3390/s101110128	laser;computer science;theoretical computer science;accuracy and precision;optics;physics;statistics	Visualization	47.10277542101687	-88.85610032305537	105529

Fundamentally, imaging in the form of computed tomography (CT), ultrasound (U/S), mammography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and fluoroscopy among others guides all treatment decision making. No sites of disease are these tools perhaps more necessary than in the radiation treatment of lung cancer. Thoracic malignancies are more than likely found in advanced, disseminated states as a consequence of the late symptoms manifested by the tumor's anatomic locations. As such, non-invasive imaging is critical to diagnosis, defining the extent of disease, and helping demarcate tumor from normal tissue structures as part of radiation treatment planning. Image guidance is also manifest to accuracy of radiation delivery and helps clinical teams identify how successfully therapy is delivered. This talk will summarize the use of imaging and image guidance in radiation treatment of lung cancers.	ct scan;resonance;tomography	Amit Sawant	2014	2014 IEEE 4th International Conference on Computational Advances in Bio and Medical Sciences (ICCABS)	10.1109/ICCABS.2014.6863950	medical imaging;radiology;computed tomography laser mammography;preclinical imaging	Vision	35.12171800599216	-84.51307187854702	105700
df6e37802956063a815db868dcd97def9c29debd	whole body mri intensity standardization	whole body;spatial coherence;magnetic resonance im aging;computed tomog raphy	A major problem of segmentation of magnetic resonance images is that intensities are not standardized like in computed tomography. This article deals with the correction of inter volume intensity differences that lead to a missing anatomical meaning of the observed gray values. We present a method for MRI intensity standardization of whole body MRI scans. The approach is based on the alignment of a learned reference and the current histogram. Each of these histograms is at least 2-d and represents two or more MRI sequences (e.g., T1and T2-weighted images). From the matching a non-linear correction function is gained which describes a mapping between the intensity spaces and consequently adapts the image statistics to a known standard. As the proposed intensity standardization is based on the statistics of the data sets only, it is independent from spatial coherences or prior segmentations of the reference and newly acquired images. Furthermore, it is not designed for a particular application, body region or acquisition protocol. The method was evaluated on whole body MRI scans containing data sets acquired by T1/FL2D and T2/TIRM sequences. In order to demonstrate the applicability, examples from noisy and pathological image series acquired on a whole body MRI scanner are given.	ct scan;nonlinear system;resonance;scene statistics;tomography	Florian Jäger;László G.

d00aa555718a1ab6ce5a205abd7642ec547a7c60	autocalibration method for non-stationary ct bias correction	bias;computed tomography;low-dose;non-stationary noise	Computed tomography (CT) is a widely used imaging modality for screening and diagnosis. However, the deleterious effects of radiation exposure inherent in CT imaging require the development of image reconstruction methods which can reduce exposure levels. The development of iterative reconstruction techniques is now enabling the acquisition of low-dose CT images whose quality is comparable to that of CT images acquired with much higher radiation dosages. However, the characterization and calibration of the CT signal due to changes in dosage and reconstruction approaches is crucial to provide clinically relevant data. Although CT scanners are calibrated as part of the imaging workflow, the calibration is limited to select global reference values and does not consider other inherent factors of the acquisition that depend on the subject scanned (e.g. photon starvation, partial volume effect, beam hardening) and result in a non-stationary noise response. In this work, we analyze the effect of reconstruction biases caused by non-stationary noise and propose an autocalibration methodology to compensate it. Our contributions are: 1) the derivation of a functional relationship between observed bias and non-stationary noise, 2) a robust and accurate method to estimate the local variance, 3) an autocalibration methodology that does not necessarily rely on a calibration phantom, attenuates the bias caused by noise and removes the systematic bias observed in devices from different vendors. The validation of the proposed methodology was performed with a physical phantom and clinical CT scans acquired with different configurations (kernels, doses, algorithms including iterative reconstruction). The results confirmed the suitability of the proposed methods for removing the intra-device and inter-device reconstruction biases.		Gonzalo Vegas-Sánchez-Ferrero;María J. Ledesma-Carbayo;George R.

This particular probe had a source-detector separation of 2.5 mm and performance was validated with Monte Carlo simulations and homogeneous phantom experiments. The goal of the current study is to characterize the performance of this new method in the context of two-layer phantoms that mimic the optical properties of human skin. We analyze the accuracy of the recovered top layer optical properties and their dependences on the thickness of the top layer of two-layer phantoms. Our results demonstrate that the optical properties of the top layer can be accurately determined with a 1.6 mm source-detector separation diffusing probe when this layer thickness is as thin as 1 mm. Monte Carlo simulations illustrate that the interrogation depth can be further decreased by shortening the source-detector separation.	body tissue;computational human phantom;detectors;experiment;leucaena pulverulenta;monte carlo method;phantoms, imaging;simulation;the superficial;thickness (graph theory);anatomical layer	Sheng-Hao Tseng;Carole K.

We propose a 2D-3D registration method using gradient-based mutual information. The 3D CT scan is aligned to 2D endoscopic images by finding the corresponding viewpoint between the real camera for endoscopic images and the virtual camera for CT scans. Even though mutual information has been successfully used to register different imaging modalities, it is difficult to robustly register the CT rendered image to the endoscopic image due to varying light patterns and shape of the vocal fold. The proposed method calculates the mutual information in the gradient images as well as original images, assigning more weight to the high gradient regions. The proposed method can emphasize the effect of vocal fold and allow a robust matching regardless of the surface illumination. To find the viewpoint with maximum mutual information, a downhill simplex method is applied in a conditional multi-resolution scheme which leads to a less-sensitive result to local maxima. To validate the registration accuracy, we evaluated the sensitivity to initial viewpoint of preoperative CT. Experimental results showed that gradient-based mutual information provided robust matching not only for two identical images with different viewpoints but also for different images acquired before and after surgery. The results also showed that conditional multi-resolution scheme led to a more accurate registration than single-resolution.	ct scan;gradient;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;mutual information;nelder–mead method;non-maskable interrupt;simplex algorithm;virtual camera system;webcam	Yeny Yim;Xuanyi Chen;Mike Wakid;Steven Bielamowicz;James K.

Though an MR scanner is expensive, the ability to consolidate diagnostic tests into a single session would significantly reduce costs and increase convenience for the patient. MRI might also provide the physician with diagnostic information on myocardial function that is not available from the standard battery of tests. In this article, we concentrate on one aspect of a cardiac MRI exam that provides previously unavailable information: assessment of myocardial contraction.		Michael A. Guttman;Elias A.

Such analysis enables, for example, microscale elements of multiple macroscale specimens to be compared throughout the entire macroscale specimen. Spatial comparisons require bringing datasets into co-alignment. One approach for co-alignment involves elastic deformations of data in addition to rigid alignments. The elastic deformations distort space, and if not accounted for, can distort the information at the microscale. The algorithms developed in this work address this issue by allowing multiple data points to be encoded into a single image pixel, appropriately tracking each data point to ensure lossless data mapping during elastic spatial deformation. This approach was developed and implemented for both 2-D and 3D registration of images. Lossless reconstruction and registration was applied to semi-quantitative cellular gene expression data in the mouse brain, enabling comparison of multiple spatially registered 3-D datasets without any augmentation of the cellular data.

It utilizes current density vector measurements which can be made using a magnetic resonance imager (MRI) (Scott et al., 1991). CDII is based on a simple mathematical expression for nablasigma/sigma = nabla ln sigma, the gradient of the logarithm of the conductivity sigma, at each point in a region where two current density vectors J1 and J2 have been measured and J1 x J2 ne 0. From the calculated nabla In sigma and a priori knowledge of the conductivity at the boundary, the logarithm of the conductivity In sigma is integrated by two different methods to produce an image of the conductivity sigma in the region of interest. The CDII technique was tested on three different conductivity phantoms. Much emphasis has been placed on the experimental validation of CDII results against direct bench measurements by commercial LCR meters before and after CDII was performed.	characteristic impedance;compact disk interactive;electromagnetically induced transparency;experiment;gradient;image sensor;imager device component;imaging techniques;instrument - device;large;logarithm;mathematics;nominal impedance;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;porcine species;quantitative impedance;region of interest;resonance;verification of theories;density;electric impedance	Karshi F.

9aff7222efefcfe164b1c870d672b02568044f58	intra-operative brain shift correction with weighted locally linear correlations of 3dus and mri		During brain tumor resection procedures, 3D ultrasound (US) can be used to assess brain shift, as intra-operative MRI is challenging due to immobilization issues, and may require sedation. Brain shift can cause uncertainty in the localization of resected tumor margins and deviate the registered pre-operative MRI surgical plan. Hence, 3D US can be used to compensate for the deformation. The objective of this study is to propose an approach to automatically register the patient’s MRI to intra-operative 3D US using a deformable registration approach based on a weighted adaptation of the locally linear correlation metric for US-MRI fusion, adapting both hyper-echoic and hypo-echoic regions within the cortex. Evaluation was performed on a cohort of 23 patients, where 3D US and MRI were acquired on the same day. The proposed approach demonstrates a statistically significant improvement of internal landmark localization made by expert radiologists, with a mean target registration error (mTRE) of (4.6 pm 3.4) mm, compared to an initial mTRE of (5.3 pm 4.2) mm, demonstrating the clinical benefit of this tool to correct for brain shift using 3D ultrasound.

With a large amount of preoperative imaging and planning information available in addition to the intraoperative images, it becomes desirable to be able to integrate all sources of imaging information within the same anatomical frame of reference using deformable image registration. Fast intensity-based algorithms are available which can perform deformable image registration within a period of time short enough for intraoperative use. However, CBCT images often contain voxel intensity inaccuracy which can hinder registration accuracy - for example, due to x-ray scatter, truncation, and/or erroneous scaling normalization within the 3D reconstruction algorithm. In this work, we present a method of integrating an iterative intensity matching step within the operation of a multi-scale Demons registration algorithm. Registration accuracy was evaluated in a cadaver model and showed that a conventional Demons implementation (with either no intensity match or a single histogram match) introduced anatomical distortion and degradation in target registration error (TRE). The iterative intensity matching procedure, on the other hand, provided robust registration across a broad range of intensity inaccuracies.© (2010) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

The synthesized images are used to define an access path for the operative treatment of diseases at the lateral skull base. Alternatively, the mastoid may be resected to allocate space for implants such as hearing aids. Methods For the preoperative planning of such surgery, accurate segmentation of the mastoid is required. A semiautomatic pipeline for segmentation of the mastoid was developed. The approach requires minimal user interaction, using a method based on generating a fast 3D-oriented primary segmentation, which (if necessary) can be refined interactively, both in 3D- and slice-based manner. Results To verify the usability of the segmentation and visualization tools for surgery planning, an evaluation study was conducted with datasets of 16 operated patients. For each patient, at least on preoperative CT scan of the skull, with focus on the region of the mastoid to be operated, was available. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the images was performed, and the results were tabulated. Conclusion Semiautomated mastoid segmentation provides a feasible means for preoperative planning, based on postprocessing analysis and visualization of CT datasets.	ct scan;human–computer interaction;interactivity;lateral thinking;usability	Zein Salah;Markus Kastner;Florian Dammann;Erwin Schwaderer;Marcus Maassen;Dirk Bartz;Wolfgang Straßer	2006	International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery	10.1007/s11548-006-0057-1	radiology;medicine;computed tomography;surgery	Visualization	38.684719539045844	-84.4396592682868	107968

Whatever the intended use, it is often necessary to distinguish between different anatomical regions within these images. Because of this, magnetic resonance images (MRIs) are generally acquired to provide an anatomical reference. This reference will only be accurate if the PET image is properly coregistered to the MRI; yet currently, a method to evaluate PET-MRI coregistration accuracy does not exist. This problem is compounded by the fact that two visually indistinguishable coregistration results can produce estimates of ligand binding that vary significantly. Therefore, the focus of this work was to develop a method that can evaluate coregistration performance based on measured ligand binding within certain regions of the coregistered PET image. The evaluation method is based on the premise that a more accurate coregistration will result in higher ligand binding in certain anatomical regions defined by the MRI. This fully automated method was able to assess coregistration results within the variance of an expert manual rater and shows promise as a possible coregistration cost function.© (2009) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

5935dd02b6bd4137a8b3e8501d76ff75394d68a1	a four-dimensional motion field atlas of the tongue from tagged and cine magnetic resonance imaging	magnetism;statistical models;human subjects;magnetic resonance imaging;tongue	Representation of human tongue motion using three-dimensional vector fields over time can be used to better understand tongue function during speech, swallowing, and other lingual behaviors. To characterize the inter-subject variability of the tongue's shape and motion of a population carrying out one of these functions it is desirable to build a statistical model of the four-dimensional (4D) tongue. In this paper, we propose a method to construct a spatio-temporal atlas of tongue motion using magnetic resonance (MR) images acquired from fourteen healthy human subjects. First, cine MR images revealing the anatomical features of the tongue are used to construct a 4D intensity image atlas. Second, tagged MR images acquired to capture internal motion are used to compute a dense motion field at each time frame using a phase-based motion tracking method. Third, motion fields from each subject are pulled back to the cine atlas space using the deformation fields computed during the cine atlas construction. Finally, a spatio-temporal motion field atlas is created to show a sequence of mean motion fields and their inter-subject variation. The quality of the atlas was evaluated by deforming cine images in the atlas space. Comparison between deformed and original cine images showed high correspondence. The proposed method provides a quantitative representation to observe the commonality and variability of the tongue motion field for the first time, and shows potential in evaluation of common properties such as strains and other tensors based on motion fields.

Biological optimization functions that optimize based on treatment outcome can be used to create SIB prostate plans. This study investigates the feasibility of biologically optimized volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) for SIB prostate radiotherapy.   METHODS Five prostate cancer patients with diffusion-weighted MR images were selected for analysis. A two-step VMAT optimization was performed, which consisted of an initial biological optimization of a static gantry angle delivery followed by conversion of the static delivery to a single arc VMAT plan. A dosimetric analysis was performed on the resulting plans.   RESULTS The VMAT plans resulted in a ΔEUD between the prostate and the boost volume of between 15.1 Gy and 20.3 Gy. Rectal volumes receiving 75.6 Gy ranged from 4.5 to 9.9%. Expected rectal normal tissue complication probabilities were between 8.6% and 21.4%. Maximum bladder doses ranged from 73.6 Gy to 75.8 Gy. Estimated treatment time was 120 s or less.   CONCLUSIONS The presented biological optimization method resulted in deliverable VMAT plans that achieved sufficient modulation for SIB without violating rectal and bladder dose constraints.

The Local Interaction Simulation Approach is proposed for effective modelling of shear wave propagation in soft tissues. The results are validated using experimental data from Magnetic Resonance Elastography. These results show the potential of the method for shear wave propagation modelling in soft tissues.

Through numerical simulation of the shock-induce electric field distribution, the outcome of a certain defibrillation shock could be predicted according to several different metrics. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation method, in which four defibrillation criteria are assigned with separate weighting factors to quantitatively assess the efficiency of a certain defibrillation shock. Three anatomically realistic finite element models of swine were constructed for the evaluation study of 8 electrode pairs in different placements. In addition, corresponding animal experiments were performed to determine the defibrillation threshold of 8 electrode placements. Both computational and experimental results suggest that the clinical recommended anterior-lateral position is the most efficient electrode displacement for transthoracic defibrillation in swine. In conclusion, the good agreement between stimulations and experiments indicates that the present multi-criteria evaluation method would be potentially useful for optimizations of cardiac defibrillation outcome.	artificial cardiac pacemaker;clinical act of insertion;computation;computer simulation;defibrillation threshold;defibrillators;displacement mapping;electric countershock;electroconvulsive therapy;evaluation;experiment;family suidae;finite element method;heat-shock proteins 70;implantable cardioverter-defibrillator;implantable defibrillator;implants;lateral thinking;numerical analysis;numerous;personnameuse - assigned;psychologic displacement;shock;statistical model	Dakun Lai;Pengye Li;Qi Xu	2015	2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319396	engineering;biological engineering;surgery;cardiology	Visualization	27.85561078676974	-84.6675462440154	108531

The EIT reconstruction problem can be approached as a nonlinear nonconvex optimization problem in which one tries to maximize the matching between a simulated impedance problem and the observed data. This nonlinear optimization problem is often ill-posed, and not very suited to methods that evaluate derivatives of the objective function. It may be approached by simulated annealing (SA), but at a large computational cost due to the expensive evaluation process of the objective function, which involves a full simulation of the impedance problem at each iteration. A variation of SA is proposed in which the objective function is evaluated only partially, while ensuring boundaries on the behavior of the modified algorithm.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;characteristic impedance;computation;dielectric spectroscopy;electromagnetically induced transparency;imaging techniques;iteration;iterative reconstruction;matching;mathematical optimization;nominal impedance;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;optimization problem;partial evaluation;quantitative impedance;reconstruction conjecture;simulated annealing;simulation;tomography;tomography, emission-computed;well-posed problem;electric impedance;electrode	Thiago de Castro Martins;Erick Dario León Bueno de Camargo;Raul Gonzalez Lima;Marcelo Britto Passos Amato;Marcos de Sales Guerra Tsuzuki	2012	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2012.2188398	computer vision;mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;medicine;finite element method;mathematics;tomography;physics	Vision	51.843700058147924	-80.6537384135535	108542

Although radiology serves as a primary diagnostic method for assessing respiratory tract infections, visual analysis of chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans is restricted by low specificity for causal infectious organisms and a limited capacity to assess severity and predict patient outcomes. These limitations suggest that computer-assisted detection (CAD) could make a valuable contribution to the management of respiratory tract infections by assisting in the early recognition of pulmonary parenchymal lesions, providing quantitative measures of disease severity and assessing the response to therapy. In this paper, we review the most common radiographic and CT features of respiratory tract infections, discuss the challenges of defining and measuring these disorders with CAD, and propose some strategies to address these challenges.	ct scan;causal filter;cessation of life;computer-aided design;lung diseases;patients;pulmonary infection;radiography;radiology;respiratory tract diseases;respiratory tract infections;respiratory tract structure;sensitivity and specificity;tract (literature);x-ray computed tomography;diagnostic procedure	Ulas Bagci;Mike Bray;Jesus Caban;Jianhua Yao;Daniel J.

Tumor has about half the electrical resistivity of normal tissue below 20 kHz, but similar resistivity above 500 kHz. We placed normal porcine liver tissue in contact with agar gel having similar resistivity as tumor within 20-450 kHz. A needle electrode was placed with half of the electrically active tip in each layer. We performed ablation with electric current applied for 12 min at 30 W, either at 20 or 450 kHz (n = 7 each), while measuring temperature via thermocouples 4 and 8 mm from the electrode. Mathematical heat-transfer models were created of an equivalent configuration and temperature profile determined at both frequencies. At 8-mm distance, at 450 kHz, tumor gel phantom and normal tissue obtained similar temperatures (57.5 ± 1.4 versus 58.7 ± 2.5 °C); at 20 kHz, tumor phantom obtained significantly higher temperatures than normal tissue (65.6 ± 2.0 versus 57.2 ± 5.6 °C, p <; 0.01).

We present a method for automatic recognition of the global  AIF based on multistage algorithm. The method is validated using real world (clinically measured) DSC-MRI image series. Only  5% of all automatically generated AIFs (one series) were rejected by the expert. The method can be easily extended to produce  a set of local AIFs and can be used as fully automatic or as an intelligent assistant tool for a neuroradiologist.

In cardiac stress-rest SPECT studies, coronary artery disease can be examined by comparing intensity differences of the acquired images of the heart at stress and rest. The stress-rest image pair needs to be aligned into the same spatial position and orientation in order to compare the images in an automated and reproducible manner. In this work, we study a novel stackgram-based alignment algorithm for cardiac stress-rest SPECT data. The stackgram approach allows the alignment of the acquired raw data prior to image reconstruction, unlike conventional alignment techniques.	alignment;arteriopathic disease;ct scan;coronary artery disease;iterative reconstruction;photons;tomography, emission-computed;tomography, emission-computed, single-photon;x-ray computed tomography;algorithm	Antti P.

The program gives a quantified measurement of image quality by calculating an Image Quality Figure (IQF). The aim of this work was to evaluate the program and adjust it to clinical situations in order to find the detectable level where the program gives a reliable figure of the contrast resolution. The program was applied on a large variety of images with lumbar spine and urographic parameters, from very low to very high image qualities. It was shown that the computer program produces IQFs with small variations and there were a strong linear statistical relation between the computerized evaluation and the evaluation performed by human observers (R2 = 0.98). This method offers a fast and easy way of conducting image quality evaluations.	behavior;bone structure of lumbar vertebra;computer program;contrast resolution;dendritic spine;evaluation;image quality;image quality:type:point in time:cardiac echo imaging device:narrative:ultrasound;phantom limb syndrome;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;shepp–logan phantom;observers	E.

90ceb98760e4e340190d5e470523f13344ffb8dc	a pipeline and metric for validation of personalized human body models		Advanced and personalized Human Body Models (HBM) are increasingly important in human centered industry design such as passive vehicular safety analysis, using finite element and other methods. Often accurate HBMs are painstakingly constructed for median human dimensions, and then modified and re-sized using personalization algorithms for various applications. Personalization algorithms rely on various anthropometric measurements, and sometimes manual intervention, to deform the median HBM. The quality of a personalized model is often defined in terms of local properties such as aspect ratio of finite elements produced. In some cases it is inferred by visual comparison with some ground truth model or by measuring the anthropometric errors with respect to known values. We seek to define the quality of deformation in anatomically suitable geometric terms, which can be automatically computed. To this end, we compare the deformed anatomical surface meshes with that of the median mesh in a shape descriptor space. Shape comparison and matching is a well studied area. The tools devised for the same are largely application dependent. We present pipeline and a metric for validating anatomical surface meshes. It is a problem that has not been extensively studied, even though general shape comparison and matching techniques abound. Our metric incorporates global and part based shape signatures. The main contribution of our work is to explore techniques suitable for comparison of anatomical meshes by non technical experts. We formulate a pipeline that needs minimal user intervention.	algorithm;anthropometry;antivirus software;comment (computer programming);comparison of raster-to-vector conversion software;emoticon;finite element method;ground truth;high bandwidth memory;matching (graph theory);online and offline;personalization;polygon mesh;resultant;shape context;type signature;visual comparison	Sukhraj Singh;Subodh Kumar	2017		10.5220/0006176201600171	bioinformatics;data science;data mining	Graphics	43.184796222511565	-89.06543275707791	109947

The tissue motion vector was successfully calculated at each pixel in a series of echo images (32 frames, 640 X 480 pixels/frame, 8 bits/pixel, 33 ms/frame) taken in the brightness mode by using an ultrasound probe of 5.0 MHz. The optical-flow technique used was a gradient method combined with local optimization for 3 X 3 neighbors. From 2D mappings of tissue motion vectors and their time-sequence variations, it was found that the tissue motion due to artery pulsation revealed periodic to-and-fro motion synchronized with heartbeat (300 - 500 ms), clearly distinguishing from unwanted non-periodic motion due to the sway of neonatal head during diagnosis.© (1999) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

Epi-retinal implants, capable of applying defined electrical stimulation impulses to the ganglion cell layer of blind patients' retinas can produce visual perception for patients suffering from retinal degeneration. The necessary software to calculate respective electrical stimulation patterns is presented in this paper - a retinomorphic system that emulates and replaces the healthy retina. The retinomorphic software computes the electrical stimulation sequences for the micro-electrode array to produce visual perception corresponding to a live video stream. This paper also presents comprehensive mathematical functions to compute the spatiotemporal sequences of retinal ganglion cell receptive fields.

Dye is injected into a blood vessel, where its movement is tracked and recorded with x-rays. Currently, a physician uses these pictures to make a qualitative judgment on the state of the heart or artery. Unfortunately, these judgments are quite often incorrect. A joint project between the Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Applied Physics Laboratory has been investigating the feasibility of digitally analyzing these angiograms, in order to better understand how blood flows through the heart and what type of occlusions are truly dangerous. APL became instrumental in this project because its powerful array manipulation functions allowed us to test our algorithms very quickly. In this overview, some of APL's features are discussed and compared to their equivalents in other software packages.	apl;algorithm;johns hopkins beast	Ian Feldberg	1990		10.1145/97808.97833	simulation;blood flow;artificial intelligence;computer graphics (images)	SE	37.86808398422243	-87.36864399790353	110184

Automated methods that allow for high throughput have not yet been developed for all anatomical targets or validated for exceptional anatomies, and manual labeling remains the gold standard in many cases. However, manual placement of labels within a large image volume such as that obtained using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is exceptionally challenging, resource intensive, and fraught with intra- and inter-rater variability. The use of statistical methods to combine labels produced by multiple raters has grown significantly in popularity, in part, because it is thought that by estimating and accounting for rater reliability estimates of the true labels will be more accurate. This paper demonstrates the performance of a class of these statistical label combination methodologies using real-world data contributed by minimally trained human raters. The consistency of the statistical estimates, the accuracy compared to the individual observations, and the variability of both the estimates and the individual observations with respect to the number of labels are presented. It is demonstrated that statistical fusion successfully combines label information using data from online (Internet-based) collaborations among minimally trained raters. This first successful demonstration of a statistically based approach using minimally trained raters opens numerous possibilities for very large scale efforts in collaboration. Extension and generalization of these technologies for new applications will certainly present fascinating areas for continuing research.	estimated;generalization (psychology);heart rate variability;inter-rater reliability;magnetic resonance imaging;medical records systems, computerized;medical imaging;science of anatomy;spatial variability;throughput;world wide web	Bennett A.

Prostate brachytherapy - an advanced radiotherapy cancer treatment in which radioactive seeds are placed directly in and around the prostate tissues - is complicated by tissue forces that tend to deflect the treatment needles from their intended positions. Medical simulation has proven useful as a technique to enhance surgeons' training and procedure rehearsal. Therefore we are developing a brachytherapy simulation system that includes visual display and haptic feedback, with which a user can see and feel the procedure of the therapy. In this paper, we describe a deformable needle insertion simulation that is a part of our brachytherapy simulation system.	insertion sort;simulation	Asako Kimura;Jon J. Camp;Richard A. Robb;Brian J.

The method is based upon a framework where distinctive 3D scale-invariant features are indexed efficiently to identify approximate nearest-neighbor (NN) feature matches-in O (log N) computational complexity in the number of images N. It thus scales well to large data sets, in contrast to methods based on pair-wise image registration or feature matching requiring O(N) complexity. Our theoretical contribution is a density estimator based on a generative model that generalizes kernel density estimation and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) methods.. The estimator can be used for on-the-fly queries, without requiring explicit parametric models or an off-line training phase. The method is validated on a large multi-site data set of 95,000,000 features extracted from 19,000 lung CT scans. Subject-level classification identifies all images of the same subjects across the entire data set despite deformation due to breathing state, including unintentional duplicate scans. State-of-the-art performance is achieved in predicting chronic pulmonary obstructive disorder (COPD) severity across the 5-category GOLD clinical rating, with an accuracy of 89% if both exact and one-off predictions are considered correct.	approximation algorithm;auditory processing disorder;big data;ct scan;chronic obstructive airway disease;computational complexity theory;extraction;generative model;gold-aluminium intermetallic;image registration;index;inference;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;kernel density estimation;lung diseases;matching;mathematical model;medical imaging;nearest-neighbor interpolation;numerous;online and offline;scanning;single linkage cluster analysis	Matthew Toews;Christian Wachinger;Raúl San José Estépar;William M.

acee3ac9d1ffb0afc4378e499450d2de2de8ac53	prostate segmentation in transrectal ultrasound using magnetic resonance imaging priors	prostate segmentation;statistical shape model;magnetic resonance imaging prior;convolutional neural network	In the current standard of care, real-time transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) is commonly used for prostate brachytherapy guidance. As TRUS provides limited soft tissue contrast, segmenting the prostate gland in TRUS images is often challenging and subject to inter-observer and intra-observer variability, especially at the base and apex where the gland boundary is hard to define. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has higher soft tissue contrast allowing the prostate to be contoured easily. In this paper, we aim to show that prostate segmentation in TRUS images informed by MRI priors can improve on prostate segmentation that relies only on TRUS images. First, we compare the TRUS-based prostate segmentation used in the treatment of 598 patients with a high-quality MRI prostate atlas and observe inconsistencies at the apex and base. Second, motivated by this finding, we propose an alternative TRUS segmentation technique that is fully automatic and uses MRI priors. The algorithm uses a convolutional neural network to segment the prostate in TRUS images at mid-gland, where the gland boundary can be clearly seen. It then reconstructs the gland boundary at the apex and base with the aid of a statistical shape model built from an MRI atlas of 78 patients. Compared to the clinical TRUS segmentation, our method achieves similar mid-gland segmentation results in the 598-patient database. For the seven patients who had both TRUS and MRI, our method achieved more accurate segmentation of the base and apex with the MRI segmentation used as ground truth. Our results suggest that utilizing MRI priors in TRUS prostate segmentation could potentially improve the performance at base and apex.	apex1 protein, human;apex (geometry);artificial neural network;atlases;biological neural networks;brachytherapy;cervical atlas;convolutional neural network;ground truth;heart rate variability;inter-rater reliability;magnetic resonance imaging;patients;real-time clock;statistical shape analysis;algorithm;biologic segmentation;dinoflagellate apex;soft tissue;transrectal ultrasound	Qi Zeng;Golnoosh Samei;Davood Karimi;Claudia Kesch;Seyedeh Sara Mahdavi;Purang Abolmaesumi;Septimiu E.

In this work we introduce a method to map tissue EPs from low-flip-angle, zero-echo-time (ZTE) imaging. It is based on a new theoretical formalism that allows calculation of EPs from the product of transmit and receive radio-frequency (RF) field maps. Compared to conventional methods requiring separation of the transmit RF field (B1+) from acquired MR images, the proposed method has such advantages as: 1) reduced theoretical error, 2) higher acquisition speed, and 3) flexibility in choice of different transmit and receive RF coils. The method is demonstrated in electrical conductivity and relative permittivity mapping in a salt water phantom, as well as in vivo measurement of brain conductivity in healthy volunteers. The phantom results show the validity and scan-time efficiency of the proposed method applied to a piece-wise homogeneous object. Quality of in vivo EP results was limited by reconstruction errors near tissue boundaries, which highlights need for image segmentation in EP mapping in a heterogeneous medium. Our results show the feasibility of rapid EP mapping from MRI without B1+ mapping.	arabic numeral 0;body tissue;electric conductivity;electric stimulation technique;expectation propagation;genetic heterogeneity;hearing loss, high-frequency;image segmentation;magnetic resonance imaging;map;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;radio frequency;semantics (computer science);video-in video-out;water cooling	Seung-Kyun Lee;Selaka Bulumulla;Florian Wiesinger;Laura Sacolick;Wei Sun;Ileana Hancu	2015	IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging	10.1109/TMI.2014.2361810	iterative reconstruction;radiology;medicine;conductivity;magnetic resonance imaging;nuclear magnetic resonance;radio frequency;permittivity;medical physics	Visualization	47.68128029233798	-83.28516217211569	111181
31484422dac0adc9ada19c083f3a52a3d405719c	advanced gpu volume rendering for virtual endoscopy		For difficult cases in endoscopic sinus surgery, a careful planning of the intervention is necessary. Virtual endoscopy enables the visualization of the operating field and additional information, such as risk structures and target structures to be removed. The Sinus Endoscopy system provides the functional range of a virtual endoscopic system with special focus on a realistic representation. Furthermore, by using direct volume rendering, we avoid time-consuming segmentation steps for the use of individual patient datasets. However, the image quality of the endoscopic view can be adjusted in a way that a standard computer with a modern standard graphics card achieves interactive frame rates with low CPU utilization. Thereby, characteristics of the endoscopic view are systematically used for the optimization of the volume rendering speed. As a small standalone application it can be instantly used for surgical planning and patient education. The system was used for preoperative planning in 102 cases, provides useful information for intervention planning (e.g., anatomic variations of the Rec. Frontalis), and closely resembles the intraoperative situation.	approximation;artistic rendering;central processing unit;computer;geforce 7 series;graphics processing unit;image quality;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;video card;volume rendering	Arno Krüger;Christoph Kubisch;Gero Strauß;Bernhard Preim	2009		10.2312/egm.20091026	computer graphics (images)	Visualization	38.467515725925495	-86.39887446280075	111508

An increasing demand for portable 3-D US equipment is one of the main trends upcoming in the market. In this study, we developed a low cost, portable, sensorless and wireless 3-D US imaging system. A laptop US scanner with a conventional linear probe and a convex probe was used to acquire 2-D US B-scans. A client programwas developed and run on the US scanner for capturing the pictures of screen during a freehand scanning without a positional sensor, and then the JPEG compression was applied to the pictures for reducing the image data size. The image data was sent to a remote workstation in real-time through Wi-Fi connection. A neural network model was used to recognize the characters (e.g. imaging depth and probe model information) displayed on the screen of the US scanner. The server on the remote workstation communicated with the US scanner, received raw image data, and finally reconstructed 3-D US images. The positions of the B-scans were obtained by estimating the spacings of B-scan image sequence, which was learned by measuring adaptive speckle decorrelation curves in mechanically collected B-scan frames. The performance of the proposed system has been demonstrated through experiments conducted on a US resolution phantom in vitro as well as human tissues in vivo. & 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.	3d computer graphics;adobe freehand;artificial neural network;ct scan;computational human phantom;decorrelation;experiment;imaging phantom;jpeg;laptop;linear probing;medical ultrasound;network model;optical character recognition;raw image format;real-time clock;server (computing);video-in video-out;workstation	Haitao Gao;Qinghua Huang;Xiangmin Xu;Xuelong Li	2016	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2015.08.109	computer vision;simulation;computer science;wireless;computer graphics (images)	ML	40.459374555339004	-88.44551552461883	111572

The average of the local wavelength from this measured data could be an index for the diagnosing, because the local wave length becomes larger when the tissue is stiffer. By assuming that the local form of the wave is given approximately as multiple complex plane waves, we identify the real part of the complex linear phase of the strongest plane wave of this multiple complex plane waves, by first applying the FBI transform (Fourier-Bros-Iagolnitzer transform) with an appropriate size of Gaussian window and then taking the maximum of the modulus of the transform with respect to the Fourier variable. The real part of the linear phase is nothing but the real inner product of the wave vector and the position vector. Similarly the imaginary part of the linear phase describes the attenuation of the wave and it is given as a real inner product of a real vector and the position vector. This vector can also be recovered by our method.

A realistic test case is used to demonstrate the approach. RBF metamodeling of simulation results is performed for continuous representation of two optimization objectives. The non-convex Pareto front of the objectives is determined by means of non-dominated set and local improvement algorithms. Uncertainties of metamodeling are estimated by means of a cross-validation procedure.

Thus, the diagnosis of critical lesions in coronary arteries is of utmost importance in clinical practice. One useful and efficient method to assess the functional severity of one or multiple lesions in a coronary artery is the calculation of the fractional flow reserve (FFR). In the current work, we present a method which allows the calculation of the FFR value computationally, without the use of a pressure wire and the induction of hyperemia, using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and biplane angiography images for three-dimensional (3D) coronary artery reconstruction and measurements of the volumetric flow rate derived from angiographic sequences. The simulated FFR values were compared to the invasively measured FFR values in 7 cases, presenting high correlation (r=0.85) and good agreement (mean difference=0.002). FFR assessment without employing a pressure wire and the induction of hyperemia is feasible using 3D reconstructed coronary artery models from angiographic and IVUS data coupled with computational fluid dynamics.	cardiovascular diseases;computation;computational fluid dynamics;coronary angiography;coronary artery;flow rate;fractional flow reserve of vessel;hydrodynamics;hyperemia;intravascular ultrasound;morbidity - disease rate;angiogram	Panagiotis K.

This degrades the quality of the surgery and the results of subsequent processing for, say, segmentation and tracking. Algorithms for desmoking and denoising laparoscopic images seem to be missing in the medical vision literature. This paper formulates the problem of joint desmoking and denoising of laparoscopic images as a Bayesian inference problem. It relies on a novel probabilistic graphical model of the images, which includes novel prior models on the uncorrupted color image as well as the transmission-map image that indicates color attenuation due to smoke. The results on simulated and real-world laparoscopic images, including clinical expert evaluation, shows the advantages of the proposed method over the state of the art.	algorithm;color image;graphical model;image segmentation;noise reduction	Alankar Kotwal;Riddhish Bhalodia;Suyash P.

Although target coordinates are calculated with high precision on the pre-operative images, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage during the procedure can lead to a brain deformation and cause potential error with respect to the surgical planning. In this paper, we propose a patient-specific biomechanical model of the brain able to recover the global deformation of the brain during this type of neurosurgical procedure. Such a model could be used to update the pre-operative planning and balance the mechanical effects of the intraoperative brain shift.

a14380b000be48effc8ce577cf2f9a64cdcd0e1b	cost-effectiveness studies on medical devices: application in cardiology		Current discussions about cost-effectiveness in the field of medical devices for cardiology are reviewed. In order to identify the trends, we performed a review of studies published in medical journals. After having reviewed 1143 originally identified papers, we finally selected 61 papers to be studied in detail. The selected papers are classified into two categories: diagnostic and therapeutic medical devices, while technology for telemedicine is briefly mentioned. In each category, cost-effectiveness results of chosen modalities are presented. The main trend seems to be avoiding invasive technology during the treatment. This trend is obvious both in the field of diagnostic and therapeutic devices. In CAD diagnostics, some authors try to prove that CT, PET or SPECT are more cost-effective than ICA. As compared with the classical (open chest) surgery in the past, the treatment of cardio-vascular illnesses is moving to less invasive interventions (TAVI versus SAVR is just one example).	computer-aided design;independent computing architecture;polyethylene terephthalate	Radka Otawova;Vojtech Kamensky;Pavla Hasenohrlova;Vladimír Rogalewicz	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-16483-0_16	medicine;pathology;biological engineering	HCI	33.58537798397173	-84.94645098000845	112404

In some of these cases, traditional prosthetic limbs may not provide adequate function for service members returning to an active lifestyle. Osseointegration has emerged as an acknowledged treatment for those with limited residual limb length and those with skin issues associated with a socket together. Using this technology, direct skeletal attachment occurs between a transcutaneous osseointegrated implant (TOI) and the host bone, thereby eliminating the need for a socket. While reports from the first 100 patients with a TOI have been promising, some rehabilitation regimens require 12-18 months of restricted weight bearing to prevent overloading at the bone-implant interface. Electrically induced osseointegration has been proposed as an option for expediting periprosthetic fixation and preliminary studies have demonstrated the feasibility of adapting the TOI into a functional cathode. To assure safe and effective electric fields that are conducive for osseoinduction and osseointegration, we have developed multiscale modeling approaches to simulate the expected electric metrics at the bone--implant interface. We have used computed tomography scans and volume segmentation tools to create anatomically accurate models that clearly distinguish tissue parameters and serve as the basis for finite element analysis. This translational computational biological process has supported biomedical electrode design, implant placement, and experiments to date have demonstrated the clinical feasibility of electrically induced osseointegration.	amputation;attachments;biological processes;bone tissue;ct scan;cochlear implant;conflict (psychology);dento-alveolar joint;electricity;electroconvulsive therapy;estimated;experiment;finite element method;genetic translation process;image segmentation;implants;limb structure;multiscale modeling;osseointegration;patients;scanning;session fixation;simulation;weight-bearing state;x-ray computed tomography	Brad Isaacson;Jeroen G.

A novel robust semi-automatic method to incorporate atrial anisotropy and heterogeneities into patient-specific models is introduced. The user needs to provide 22 distinct seed-points from which a network of auxiliary lines is constructed. These are used to define fiber orientation and myocardial bundles. The method was applied to 14 patient-specific volumetric models derived from CT, MRI and photographic data. Initial electrophysiological simulations show a significant influence of anisotropy and heterogeneity on the excitation pattern and P-wave duration (20.7% shortening). Fiber modeling results show good overall correspondence with anatomical data. Minor modeling errors are observed if more than four pulmonary veins exist in the model. The method is an important step towards creating realistic patient-specific atrial models for clinical applications.	semiconductor industry	Martin W. Krüger;Viktor Schmidt;Catalina Tobón;Frank M.

Typically, commercial imaging systems use fast empirical corrections that are designed to reduce visible artifacts due to incomplete modeling of the image formation process. In contrast, Monte Carlo (MC) methods are much more accurate but are relatively slow. Scatter kernel superposition (SKS) methods offer a balance between accuracy and computational practicality. We show how a single SKS algorithm can be employed to correct both kilovoltage (kV) energy (diagnostic) and megavoltage (MV) energy (treatment) X-ray images. Using MC models of kV and MV imaging systems, we map intensities recorded on an amorphous silicon flat panel detector to water-equivalent thicknesses (WETs). Scattergrams are derived from acquired projection images using scatter kernels indexed by the local WET values and are then iteratively refined using a scatter magnitude bounding scheme that allows the algorithm to accommodate the very high scatter-to-primary ratios encountered in kV imaging. The algorithm recovers radiological thicknesses to within 9% of the true value at both kV and megavolt energies. Nonuniformity in CT reconstructions of homogeneous phantoms is reduced by an average of 76% over a wide range of beam energies and phantom geometries.	computation;cone beam computed tomography;detectors;diagnostic radiologic examination;energy, physics;flat panel detector;flat panel display;hepatocyte growth factor;image formation;index;monte carlo method;morphologic artifacts;pet/ct scan;partial;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;radiology;silicon;x-ray computed tomography;algorithm	Jonathan S.

Algorithms are typically optimized for a targeted tissue contrast obtained from a particular implementation of a pulse sequence on a specific scanner. There are many practical situations, including multi-institution trials, rapid emergency scans, and scientific use of historical data, where the images are not acquired according to an optimal protocol or the desired tissue contrast is entirely missing. This paper introduces an image restoration technique that recovers images with both the desired tissue contrast and a normalized intensity profile. This is done using patches in the acquired images and an atlas containing patches of the acquired and desired tissue contrasts. The method is an example-based approach relying on sparse reconstruction from image patches. Its performance in demonstrated using several examples, including image intensity normalization, missing tissue contrast recovery, automatic segmentation, and multimodal registration. These examples demonstrate potential practical uses and also illustrate limitations of our approach.	algorithm;atlases;circuit restoration;image analysis;image restoration;multimodal interaction;numerous;patch (computing);resonance;scanner device component;sparse matrix	Snehashis Roy;Aaron Carass;Jerry L.

Due to relatively low spatial resolution, the accuracy of CBF measurement is affected by the partial volume (PV) effect. In general ASL sequence, multiple scans of perfusion image pairs are acquired temporally to improve the signal to noise ratio. Several spatial PV correction methods have been proposed for the simple averaging of pair-difference images, while the perfusion information of gray matter and white matter existed in multiple image pairs was totally ignored. In this study, a statistical model of perfusion mixtures inside each voxel for the 4D ASL sequence is first proposed. To solve the model, a simplified method is proposed, in which the linear regression (LR) method is first used to obtain initial estimates of spatial correction, then an EM (expectation maximization) method is used to obtain accurate estimation using temporal information. The combination of LR and EM method (EM-LR) can effectively utilize the spatial-temporal information of ASL data for PV correction and provide a theoretical solution to estimate the perfusion mixtures. Both simulated and in vivo data were used to evaluate the performance of proposed method, which demonstrated its superiority on PV correction, edge preserving, and noise suppression.	expectation–maximization algorithm;lr parser;signal-to-noise ratio;statistical model;video-in video-out;voxel;zero suppression	Yang Liu;Baojuan Li;Xi Zhang;Linchuan Zhang;Zhengrong Liang;Hongbing Lu	2015		10.1117/12.2081923	statistical model;cerebral blood flow;speech recognition;computer science;artificial intelligence;signal-to-noise ratio	Vision	45.5127852161549	-81.93293201431098	113451

This usually occurs at sites which bear weight during normal use. Measurement of such loss from MRI scans, requires precise and reproducible techniques, which can overcome the difficulties of patient repositioning within the scanner. In this study, we combine a previously described technique for segmentation of cartilage from MRI of the knee, with a technique for 3D image registration that matches localized regions of interest at followup and baseline. Two patients, who had recently undergone meniscal surgery, and developed lesions during the 12 month followup period were examined. Image registration matched regions of interest (ROI) between baseline and followup, and changes within the cartilage lesions were estimate to be about a 16% reduction in cartilage volume within each ROI. This was more than 5 times the reproducibility of the measurement, but only represented a change of between 1 and 2% in total femoral cartilage volume. Changes in total cartilage volume may be insensitive for quantifying changes in cartilage morphology. A combined used of automated image segmentation, with 3D image registration could be a useful tool for the precise and sensitive measurement of localized changes in cartilage from MRI of the knee.© (2001) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

We explored a method for reducing current density and corrosion, by varying the leading edge of the current pulse. Finite-element modeling and mathematical analysis were used to predict an optimal waveform that reduces current density at the edge while also maintaining short pulse duration. An approximation of the optimized waveform was implemented experimentally and applied to platinum disk electrodes. Surface analysis using energy-dispersive spectroscopy showed significant reduction of corrosion on the periphery of these electrodes after pulsing, compared to those pulsed with the control rectangular waveform.	approximation;artificial cardiac pacemaker;corrosion of medical device material;current source device component;deep brain stimulation;dispersive partial differential equation;experiment;finite element method;mathematical optimization;mathematics;noise shaping;numbers;platinum;pulse duration;soft tissue injuries;waveform;benefit;electrode	Boshuo Wang;Artin Petrossians;James D.

643c5a457b7e6fd6ef8c152f87a1494996d243e5	construction of a neonatal cortical surface atlas using multimodal surface matching in the developing human connectome project	cortical surface atlas;mri;msm;neonatal;dhcp	We propose a method for constructing a spatio-temporal cortical surface atlas of neonatal brains aged between 36 and 44 weeks of post-menstrual age (PMA) at the time of scan. The data were acquired as part of the Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP), and the constructed surface atlases are publicly available. The method is based on a spherical registration approach: Multimodal Surface Matching (MSM), using cortical folding for driving the alignment. Templates have been generated for the anatomical cortical surface and for the cortical feature maps: sulcal depth, curvature, thickness, T1w/T2w myelin maps and cortical regions. To achieve this, cortical surfaces from 270 infants were first projected onto the sphere. Templates were then generated in two stages: first, a reference space was initialised via affine alignment to a group average adult template. Following this, templates were iteratively refined through repeated alignment of individuals to the template space until the variability of the average feature sets converged. Finally, bias towards the adult reference was removed by applying the inverse of the average affine transformations on the template and de-drifting the template. We used temporal adaptive kernel regression to produce age-dependant atlases for 9 weeks (36-44 weeks PMA).

1626d0b6ef75f081387478c1540c6d4b3c09295e	electromagnetic anchor tracking for soft tissue navigation		The compensation of intraoperative (rigid) movements and the detection and compensation of deformations is still a big challenge for navigation systems in soft tissue and in particular liver surgery. Although most clinical navigation systems are based on optical tracking systems recent improvements enable navigation systems based on electromagnetic tracking systems. With electromagnetic tracking systems it is possible to measure continuously locations of sensor coils inside the body. We present an algorithm to compensate (rigid) movements and detect deformations of soft tissue like liver parenchyma based on locations inside the tissue. We performed an ex vivo experiment with a turkey breast. The position of a target point was predicted by the algorithm and this prediction compared to the direct measurement of the target point by the electromagnetic tracking system.

Images were created from the NCAT mathematical phantom with a realistic heart simulating hypokinetic motion in the left lateral wall. Realistic noise-free projection data were simulated for both normal and defective hearts to obtain 16 frames for the cardiac cycle. Poisson noise was then simulated for each frame to create 50 realizations of each heart. All datasets were processed in two ways: reconstructed as a 16-frame set, and collapsed to 8 frames and reconstructed. Ten observers viewed the cardiac images animated with a realistic real-time frame rate. Observers trained on 100 images and tested on 100 images, rating their confidence on the presence of a motion defect on a continuous scale. None of the observers showed a significant difference in performance between the two gating methods. The 95% confidence interval on the difference in areas under the ROC curve (Az/sub 8/-Az/sub 16/) was -0.029-0.085. Our test did not find a significant difference in detection performance between 8-frame gating and 16-frame gating. We conclude that, for the task of detecting abnormal motion, increasing the number of gated frames from 8 to 16 offers no apparent advantage.	behavior;ct scan;clock gating;confidence intervals;congenital abnormality;frame (physical object);framing (world wide web);heart;imaging phantom;lateral computing;lateral thinking;magnetic resonance imaging;mathematics;phantoms, imaging;photons;real-time clock;receiver operating characteristic;sensor;simulation;software bug;tomography, emission-computed;tomography, emission-computed, single-photon;tooth abnormalities;x-ray computed tomography;observers	David S.

However, currently there is no standard for integration of diagnostic information from different MRI sequences. We propose a method to increase the diagnostic accuracy of MRI by correlating biopsy specimens with four MRI sequences including T2 weighted MRI, Diffusion Weight Imaging, Dynamic Contrast Enhanced MRI and MRI spectroscopy. This method uses device tracking and image fusion to determine the specimen's position on MRI images. The proposed method is unbiased and cost effective. It does not substantially interfere with the standard biopsy workflow, allowing it to be easily accepted by physicians. A study of 41 patients was carried out to validate the approach. The performance of all four MRI sequences in various combinations is reported. Guidelines are given for multi-parametric imaging and tracked biopsy of prostate cancer.© (2010) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

Due to the missing depth information in the X-ray visualization, it is highly difficult in particular for junior physicians to place the stent graft in the preoperatively defined position within the aorta. Therefore, advanced 3D visualization of stent grafts is highly required. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm to automatically match a 3D model of the stent graft to an intraoperative 2D image showing the device. By automatic preprocessing and a global-to-local registration approach, we are able to abandon user interaction and still meet the desired robustness. The complexity of our registration scheme is reduced by a semi-simultaneous optimization strategy incorporating constraints that correspond to the geometric model of the stent graft. Via experiments on synthetic, phantom, and real interventional data, we are able to show that the presented method matches the stent graft model to the 2D image data with good accuracy.	3d modeling;algorithm;aorta;experiment;geometric modeling;grafting (decision trees);imagery;imaging phantom;mathematical optimization;para-aortic node;phantoms, imaging;preprocessor;semiconductor industry;stent device component;stent, device;surgical repair;synthetic data;transplanted tissue;visualization (graphics);registration - actclass	Stefanie Demirci;Ali Bigdelou;Lejing Wang;Christian Wachinger;Maximilian Baust;Radhika Tibrewal;Reza Ghotbi;Hans-Henning Eckstein;Nassir Navab	2011	Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ...

244f038a49c5504978f8753884080f6b7fa655ff	a semi-automated quality assurance toolbox for diagnostic radiological imaging	quality assurance	Magnetic Resonance (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT) and Ultrasound (US) are three of the most commonly used clinical imaging modalities. The aim of this study was to establish a Quality Assurance program for MRI, CT and US scanners. A well-designed quality assurance program is of utmost importance in the clinical setting, because it indicates whether diagnostic imaging modalities meet the minimum criteria of acceptable performance and because it helps determine those scanner parameters that need adjustment in order to ensure optimum performance. Quality assurance programs that rely on manual data collection and analysis are tedious and time consuming and are often abandoned due to the significant workload required for their implementation. In this paper we describe an integrated software system for automating the process of data collection and management in Quality Assurance for diagnostic radiological imaging. The developed system is comprised of two main units: The Image Processing Unit (IPU) and the Data Management Unit (DMU). The IPU is used for analysing images from different diagnostic modalities in order to extract measurements. The IPU is dynamically linked to the DMU so that measurements are transferred directly to the DMU. This process allows the generation of quality assurance reports for all such modalities.	ct scan;image processing;integrated software;medical imaging;resonance;semiconductor industry;software system;tomography	Christodoulos Constantinou;Andreas Grondoudis;Andreas Christoforou;Christakis Constantinides;Andreas Lanitis	2006			computer science	SE	38.851817753914325	-86.64547190253936	114513
05007b941475f563bc42b5927efac53ca31c9c7d	efficient liver segmentation using a level-set method with optimal detection of the initial liver boundary from level-set speed images	optimal estimation;level set;contrast enhanced computed tomography;ct scan;seeded region growing;liver transplantation;computational efficiency;level set method;speed image;liver segmentation;shape propagation	Automatic liver segmentation is difficult because of the wide range of human variations in the shapes of the liver. In addition, nearby organs and tissues have similar intensity distributions to the liver, making the liver's boundaries ambiguous. In this study, we propose a fast and accurate liver segmentation method from contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) images. We apply the two-step seeded region growing (SRG) onto level-set speed images to define an approximate initial liver boundary. The first SRG efficiently divides a CT image into a set of discrete objects based on the gradient information and connectivity. The second SRG detects the objects belonging to the liver based on a 2.5-dimensional shape propagation, which models the segmented liver boundary of the slice immediately above or below the current slice by points being narrow-band, or local maxima of distance from the boundary. With such optimal estimation of the initial liver boundary, our method decreases the computation time by minimizing level-set propagation, which converges at the optimal position within a fixed iteration number. We utilize level-set speed images that have been generally used for level-set propagation to detect the initial liver boundary with the additional help of computationally inexpensive steps, which improves computational efficiency. Finally, a rolling ball algorithm is applied to refine the liver boundary more accurately. Our method was validated on 20 sets of abdominal CT scans and the results were compared with the manually segmented result. The average absolute volume error was 1.25+/-0.70%. The average processing time for segmenting one slice was 3.35 s, which is over 15 times faster than manual segmentation or the previously proposed technique. Our method could be used for liver transplantation planning, which requires a fast and accurate measurement of liver volume.

Chondrocytes reside within the cartilage matrix and maintain its structure. We conducted in vitro experiments to investigate the morphological response of cultured human chondrocytes under different pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) conditions. In the control experiments, cultured chondrocytes attached to the bottom of a culture dish typically displayed either a stellate or spindle morphology with extended processes. Experimental chondrocyte cultures were placed in a Helmholtz coil to which a ramp waveform was applied. Exposure to PEMFs caused the chondrocytes to retract their processes, becoming spherical in shape. This change in morphology followed a progression from stellate to spindle to spherical. These morphological changes were reflected in an average reduction of 30% in the surface contact area of the chondrocytes to the culture dish. Understanding the mechanisms by which PEMFs affect the morphology of chondrocytes will help lead to new treatments for osteoarthritis.	arthropathy;chondrocyte;coil device component;color gradient;degenerative polyarthritis;electromagnetic radiation;electrophoresis, gel, pulsed-field;experiment;galaxy morphological classification;hard disk drive;hertz (hz);magnetic fields;mathematical morphology;pulsed electromagnetic field therapy;ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability;structure of articular cartilage;tesla coil;theory;waveform;negative resolution <retracted>	M.

A comparison with two other methods reported in the literature for image fusion (averaging and intensity modulation techniques) was performed.   METHODS For FE, the Fourier transform of the merged image was obtained summing the low frequencies of the PET image and the high frequencies of the MR image. For image averaging, the merged image was obtained as a weighted average of the intensities of the two images to be merged. For intensity modulation, the red, green and blue components of the color image were multiplied on a pixel-by-pixel basis by the grayscale image. A comparison of the performances of the three techniques was made by three independent observers assessing the conspicuity of specific MRI and PET information in the merged images. For evaluation purposes, images from seven patients and a computer-simulated MRI/PET phantom were used. Data were compared with a chi-square test applied to ranks.   RESULTS For the depiction of MRI and PET information when merging color PET and T1-weighted MR images, FE was rated superior to intensity modulation and averaging techniques in a significant number of comparisons. For merging grayscale PET with multispectral color MR images, FE and intensity modulation were rated superior to image averaging in terms of both MRI and PET information.   CONCLUSION The data suggest that improved simultaneous evaluation of MRI and PET information can be achieved with a method based on FE.	chi-square test;color image;computer simulation;effective method;grayscale color map;hearing loss, high-frequency;image fusion;imaging phantom;merge;modulation;multispectral image;patients;performance;phantoms, imaging;pixel;polyethylene terephthalate;positron-emission tomography;rating (action);observers	Úlfar Steingrímsson;Peter Zolliker	1999	Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine		color histogram;color image;hsl and hsv;rgb color space;computer vision;color depth;rgb color model;high color;artificial intelligence;mathematics;color space	Vision	41.9093432259873	-89.07090967520224	114725

However, it is often difficult to detect and interpret the subtle image contrast changes produced by these agents if the biodistribution is not known a priori. Sensitive post-processing methods are needed to help identify localized accumulations of contrast agent and to minimize false positives and negatives. Towards these goals, we apply image cross-correlation methods to MRI phase images to highlight the characteristic magnetic susceptibility pattern created by magnetic dipoles in a magnetic field. We show that this method is very effective in highlighting localized paramagnetic deposits. We investigate the detection limits of this cross-correlation method, and we find that it can be used even for images with a very low signal-to-noise ratio (< 4). This method can be used alongside existing magnitude MRI methods, requires no extra scan time, and can be applied retrospectively to previously acquired data	cross-correlation;resonance;signal-to-noise ratio;video post-processing;video-in video-out	Parker H.

As its use increases, the issue of accuracy becomes critical. There have been very few studies examining the accuracy of volume rendering techniques. We studied the accuracy of hardware-assisted volume rendering for measurement of arterial stenosis in computed tomography (CT) data. The results of our study reveal that accurate measurements can be made from volume rendered CT data. However, error is present (absolute average error from 5.1% to 13.6%) and there is some variability, even for experts (standard deviation ranged from 4.8% to 15%). The evidence suggests that the choice of volume rendering (transfer function) parameters greatly affects the accuracy of the results. Accurate transfer function parameter selection is a fiddicult problem. Parameters that produce realistic images often provide inaccurate measurements. As the use of volume visualization grows and more inexperienced users begin using these tools for medical diagnosis and staging, new guidelines, aids, and techniques must be developed to ensure reliable, accurate visualization results.	acquired immunodeficiency syndrome;ct scan;disk staging;experience;imagery;parameter (computer programming);population parameter;scientific visualization;spatial variability;stenosis;transfer function;volume rendering;x-ray computed tomography	David S.

Myocardial perfusion imaging, which contains functional information, is useful for non–invasive diagnosis of myocardial disease but noises caused by physical factors and low resolution give difficulty in reading the images. In order to help reading myocardial images, this study proposed a method that segments myocardial images and reconstructs the segmented region into a 3D image. To resolve difficulty in reading, we segmented the left ventricle, the region of interest, using a level set and modeled the segmented region into a 3D image.	ct scan;cardiac wall structure;cardiomyopathies;experiment;heart ventricle;image resolution;left ventricular structure;myocardium;perfusion imaging;photons;radiopharmaceuticals;recombinant interferon-gamma;region of interest;stereoscopy;tomography, emission-computed;x-ray computed tomography;algorithm	Hwun-Jae Lee;SangBock Lee	2010	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-010-9575-z	radiology;medicine;nuclear medicine;segmentation;medical physics	Vision	44.51975595043966	-83.9241263612322	115396

The analysis  of the biophysical conditions of the heart-coronary vessels system has been used to distinguish the tissue environment properties  which should be compatible with properties of the metal biomaterial and stent surface. The need to determine the correct quality  and service properties of the coronary stents has been indicated, which refer first of all to their design form, physical  and chemical properties of the metal biomaterial and its surface. Based on that the Author of the work has proposed his own  methodology for forming and controlling the service properties of the stents. It takes into account the required relationships  between structure, and mechanical properties of the stent biomaterial, and the physical and chemical properties of its surface  - adjusted to the specific features of the cardiovascular system.

We used for the necessary validation phases the Lyme database, recorded to study the Lyme borreliosis, by the Italian Working Group on Lyme disease (Ist. Bruuone Rheumatological Center Dept. of Internal Medicine of Genoa University). A procedure using a combination of statistical analysis and a standard supervised neural method obtained a very good classification (diagnosis) performance, but the resulting rules (characterization) were readable only in a rough form. A different approach was used to extract more readable rules. A binary-units network was trained by an information-theoretic leaming rule (CCE). The result is a hierarchy of rules describing the classification by a sequence of yedno questions, confirming the known diagnostic criteria to a satisfactory extent. The next step was to obtain a confirmation from an unsupervised meihod. An auto-associative network trained by backpropagation was used. The output of this method was a clustering of the patterns, and their interpretation led to the same conclusions of the CCE approach.	backpropagation;certified computer examiner;cluster analysis;human-readable medium;information theory;lyme (software bundle);rule induction;unsupervised learning	Gerolamo Bianchi;Laura Buffrini;Patrizia Monteforte;Guido Rovetta;Stefano Rovetta;Rodolfo Zunino	1994		10.1109/CBMS.1994.316010	computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;medical diagnosis;data mining;artificial neural network	ML	29.707481642068924	-80.9527630345474	115927

Optical spectroscopy has been proposed for quantification of minimal changes in skin offering itself as an interesting tool for monitoring of CTCL in real-time. However, in order to be used in a valid way, measurements on the lesions have to be taken at the same position and with the same orientation in each session. Combining hand-held optical spectroscopy devices with tracking and acquiring synchronously spectral information with position and orientation, we introduce a novel computer-assisted scheme for valid spectral quantification of disease progression. We further present an implementation for an augmented reality guidance system that allows to find a point previously analyzed with an accuracy of 0.8[mm] and 5.0[deg] (vs. 1.6[mm] and 6.6[deg] without guidance). The intuitive guidance, as well as the preliminary results shows that the presented approach has great potential towards innovative computer-assistance methods for quantification of disease progression.© (2010) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

e93c4f62cb3d74b97d1785099f4bf00b23bebed7	power spectrum analysis of an anthropomorphic breast phantom compared to patient data in 2d digital mammography and breast tomosynthesis		Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images of a novel anthropomorphic breast phantom (UPenn phantom) acquired on two breast tomosynthesis systems were analyzed in terms of their power spectra (PS). The β and κ power law coefficients were estimated from 2D planar, tomosynthesis projection images and reconstructed planes. These data were compared to the PS characteristics as retrieved from a group of patient data. Power spectra of the UPenn phantom images were very similar to the patient data, with power law parameters in the range of values found in patients. Power law exponents were 2.99 and 3.45 for 2D, 2.87 and 2.75 for DBT projections and, 1.92 and 3.10 for DBT reconstructions for the Siemens and Hologic system respectively. The agreement was better than with other (non-anthropomorphic) 3D structured phantoms, making this phantom a good candidate test object for DBT performance testing.	coefficient;computational human phantom;imaging phantom;phantom reference;shepp–logan phantom;software performance testing;spectral density;tomosynthesis	Lesley Cockmartin;Predrag R.

a42ca01660af1f1bb9333b4f8ac693987ae65edf	automatic control-point selection for image registration using disparity fitting	wavelet transforms;iterative methods;image registration	We present an algorithm for automatically selecting and matching control points for the purpose of registering images acquired using different imaging modalities. The modulus maxima of the wavelet transform were used to define a criterion for identifying control points. This criterion is capable of selecting points based on the size of features in the image. This technique can be tailored, by adjusting the scale of the filters in the modulus calculation, to the specific objects or structures known to occur in each image being registered. The control-point matching technique includes an iterative method for reducing the set of control-point pairs using the horizontal and vertical disparities between the matched pairs of points. Least-squares planes are fit to the horizontal and vertical disparity data, and control-point pairings are deleted based on their distances from those planes. The remaining points are used to recompute the planes. The process is iterated until the remaining points fall within a certain distance from the planes. Finally, a spatial transformation is performed on the template image to bring it into alignment with the reference image. The result of the control-point pair reduction is a more accurate alignment than what would have been produced using the initial control-point pairs. These techniques are applicable to medical images, but examples are given using images of paintings.© (2012) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

In the reconstruction procedure, the utilization of adaptive finite element methods (FEMs) and a priori permissible source region refines the reconstructed results and improves numerical robustness and efficiency. The comparison between the absence and employment of a priori information shows that multimodality imaging fusion is essential to quantitative BLT reconstruction.	balanced ligamentous tension technique (procedure);bioluminescence test;ct scan;finite element method;multimodal imaging;robustness (computer science);scanner device component;x-ray microtomography;tomography	Yujie Lu;Jie Tian;Wenxiang Cong;Ge Wang	2007	International Journal of Biomedical Imaging	10.1155/2007/86741	biology;medical research;medicine;pathology;computer science;bioinformatics	Vision	46.83983022244588	-84.80169497024022	116874
f25edf0a54807bc77eb214f9fe0502d1448f34e7	model-based reconstruction for t1 mapping using single-shot inversion-recovery radial flash	t1 mapping;iterative reconstruction;radial flash;relaxometry;model based reconstruction	Quantitative parameter mapping in MRI is typically performed as a two-step procedure where serial imaging is followed by pixelwise model fitting. In contrast, model-based reconstructions directly reconstruct parameter maps from raw data without explicit image reconstruction. Here, we propose a method that determines T1 maps directly from multi-channel raw data as obtained by a single-shot inversion-recovery radial FLASH acquisition with a Golden Angle view order. Joint reconstruction of a T1, spin-density and flip-angle map is formulated as a nonlinear inverse problem and solved by the iteratively regularized Gauss-Newton method. Coil sensitivity profiles are determined from the same data in a preparatory step of the reconstruction. Validations included numerical simulations, in vitro MRI studies of an experimental T1 phantom, and in vivo studies of brain and abdomen of healthy subjects at a field strength of 3 T. The results obtained for a numerical and experimental phantom demonstrated excellent accuracy and precision of model-based T1 mapping. In vivo studies allowed for high-resolution T1 mapping of human brain (0.5–0.75 mm in-plane, 4 mm section thickness) and liver (1.0 mm, 5 mm section) within 3.6–5 s. In conclusion, the proposed method for model-based T1 mapping may become an alternative to two-step techniques, which rely on model fitting after serial image reconstruction. More extensive clinical trials now require accelerated computation and online implementation of the algorithm. VC 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

f96141ea265675f852d1d2770cc9dbbcc3c36e50	software toolbox for low-frequency conductivity and current density imaging using mri		Objective: Low-frequency conductivity and current density imaging using MRI includes magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (MREIT), diffusion tensor MREIT (DT-MREIT), conductivity tensor imaging (CTI), and magnetic resonance current density imaging (MRCDI). MRCDI and MREIT provide current density and isotropic conductivity images, respectively, using current-injection phase MRI techniques. DT-MREIT produces anisotropic conductivity tensor images by incorporating diffusion weighted MRI into MREIT. These current-injection techniques are finding clinical applications in diagnostic imaging and also in transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), deep brain stimulation (DBS), and electroporation where treatment currents can function as imaging currents. To avoid adverse effects of nerve and muscle stimulations due to injected currents, conductivity tensor imaging (CTI) utilizes B1 mapping and multi-b diffusion weighted MRI to produce low-frequency anisotropic conductivity tensor images without injecting current. This paper describes numerical implementations of several key mathematical functions for conductivity and current density image reconstructions in MRCDI, MREIT, DT-MREIT, and CTI. Methods: To facilitate experimental studies of clinical applications, we developed a software toolbox for these low-frequency conductivity and current density imaging methods. This MR-based conductivity imaging (MRCI) toolbox includes 11 toolbox functions which can be used in the MATLAB environment. Results: The MRCI toolbox is available at http://iirc.khu.ac.kr/software.html . Its functions were tested by using several experimental datasets, which are provided together with the toolbox. Conclusion: Users of the toolbox can focus on experimental designs and interpretations of reconstructed images instead of developing their own image reconstruction softwares. We expect more toolbox functions to be added from future research outcomes.	characteristic impedance;computerized thermal imaging;current density imaging;deep brain stimulation;echo-planar imaging;experiment;experimental design;interpretation process;iterative reconstruction;matlab;magnetic resonance imaging;mathematics;medical imaging;muscle;numerical analysis;numerous;tomography;transcranial direct current stimulation;electric impedance	Saurav Z.

Although best known from the medical CATscan, tomography is also a powerful tool for geological problems. Whereas qualitative tomography is widely used, quantitative data from tomograms are not so commonly available. Presented here are two programs, Electron Tomography Segmentation, surface Area, and Volume (ETSAV) and Electron Tomography CUTter (ETCut), that were written to obtain quantitative volume and surface-area data from tomograms. Based on a specified threshold value, ETSAV distinguishes objects within a tomogram and then returns volume and surface-area data for each object. If object separation is unsatisfactory using a single threshold, ETCut is called to digitally separate objects that appear connected in the tomogram, allowing ETSAV to perform its functions. By knowing the nature of the object of interest, error can be corrected to, on average, less than 5% for a single object; combined volumes of many particles of different sizes may result in lesser errors. A section of the Brenham pallasite meteorite was examined using the programs. Olivine comprises 67.2% of the volume (50.4%wt%), followed by FeNi metal at 23.1% (39.3%wt%), troilite at 4.4% (4.8%wt%), and schreibersite at 3.4% (5.5%wt%). In all, 56.1% and 44.7% of the troilite and schreibersite surface areas, respectively, border olivine, suggesting that they wet olivine. Since the programs can be applied to any tomogram, from any field, there are many potential applications.	tomography	Jacob Spinsby;Heiner Friedrich;Peter R.

36a2574855d57481191c32bc373c9c2b81dfc1a9	intensity inhomogeneity correction of sd-oct data using macular flatspace	intensity inhomogeneity correction;macular flatspace;optical coherence tomography;registration;retina	Images of the retina acquired using optical coherence tomography (OCT) often suffer from intensity inhomogeneity problems that degrade both the quality of the images and the performance of automated algorithms utilized to measure structural changes. This intensity variation has many causes, including off-axis acquisition, signal attenuation, multi-frame averaging, and vignetting, making it difficult to correct the data in a fundamental way. This paper presents a method for inhomogeneity correction by acting to reduce the variability of intensities within each layer. In particular, the N3 algorithm, which is popular in neuroimage analysis, is adapted to work for OCT data. N3 works by sharpening the intensity histogram, which reduces the variation of intensities within different classes. To apply it here, the data are first converted to a standardized space called macular flat space (MFS). MFS allows the intensities within each layer to be more easily normalized by removing the natural curvature of the retina. N3 is then run on the MFS data using a modified smoothing model, which improves the efficiency of the original algorithm. We show that our method more accurately corrects gain fields on synthetic OCT data when compared to running N3 on non-flattened data. It also reduces the overall variability of the intensities within each layer, without sacrificing contrast between layers, and improves the performance of registration between OCT images.	apache axis;class;image histogram;macular edema, cystoid;marfan syndrome;moose file system;numerous;retina;sd, rat strain;smoothing (statistical technique);spatial variability;synthetic data;tomography, optical coherence;algorithm;anatomical layer;tomography	Andrew Lang;Aaron Carass;Bruno Jedynak;Sharon D.

A delicate and often-studied component is the interpolation of off-grid samples, where aliasing can lead to misleading artifacts and blurring, potentially hiding fine details of critical importance. The verifiable visualization framework we describe aims to account for these errors directly in the volume generation stage, and we specifically target volumetric data obtained via computed tomography (CT) reconstruction. In this case the raw data are the X-ray projections obtained from the scanner and the volume data generation process is the CT algorithm. Our framework informs the CT reconstruction process of the specific filter intended for interpolation in the subsequent visualization process, and this in turn ensures an accurate interpolation there at a set tolerance. Here, we focus on fast trilinear interpolation in conjunction with an octree-type mixed resolution volume representation without T-junctions. Efficient rendering is achieved by a space-efficient and locality-optimized representation, which can straightforwardly exploit fast fixed-function pipelines on GPUs.	algorithm;aliasing;artifact (software development);blurred vision;ct scan;coherence (physics);diagnostic radiologic examination;digital video recorder;experiment;fixed-function;formal verification;gaussian blur;gradient;graphics processing unit;ibm notes;imagery;institute for operations research and the management sciences;interpolation imputation technique;locality of reference;morphologic artifacts;octree;oversampling;pipeline (computing);preprocessor;projections and predictions;propagation of uncertainty;real life;real-time computer graphics;sampling - surgical action;scanner device component;scientific visualization;shading;silo (dataset);software propagation;transfer function;united states national institutes of health;x-ray computed tomography	Ziyi Zheng;Wei Xu;Klaus Mueller	2010	IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics	10.1109/TVCG.2010.211	iterative reconstruction;computer vision;radon transform;rendering;interpolation;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;pipeline transport;fourier analysis;computer graphics;frequency domain;data visualization;statistics;trilinear interpolation;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	46.514566452990955	-82.31368586817352	117588

Estimation of these parameters is still an open problem, which hinders the application of various robot-assisted surgeries, such as autonomous injection. This paper presents a method to estimate the position and pose of beveled needle using three-dimensional Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) image cube. The incomplete 3D point cloud of beveled needle obtained from OCT image cube is used to reconstruct the needle by fitting the projection of needle points based on its geometric features. We demonstrate the applicability of our method in ophthalmic injection surgery using ex vivo pig eyes and evaluate the accuracy of position and pose information using a micromanipulator.	3d pose estimation;autonomous robot;cross-validation (statistics);point cloud;repeatability;sql injection;tomography;video-in video-out	Mingchuan Zhou;Kai Huang;Abouzar Eslami;Hessam Roodaki;Haotian Lin;Chris P.

1dfb99843fa94784e2185a7a8d52a8fc9f006439	fast diffeomorphic image registration via gpu-based parallel computing: an investigation of the matching cost function		Large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) is one of the state-of-the-art deformable image registration algorithms that has been shown to be of superior performance, especially for brain images. LDDMM was originally proposed for matching intra-modality images, with the Sum of Squared Difference (SSD) being used as the matching cost function. Extension of LDDMM to other types of matching cost functions has been very limited. In this paper, we systematically evaluated three different matching cost functions, the SSD, the Mutual Information (MI), and the Cross Correlation (CC) in the LDDMM-image setting, based on 14 subcortical and ventricular structures in a total of 120 pairs of brain images. In addition, we proposed an efficient implementation for those three LDDMM-image settings via GPU-base parallel computing and quantitatively compared with the standard open source implementation of LDDMM-SSD in terms of both registration accuracy and computational time. The proposed parallelization and optimization approach resulted in an acceleration by 28 times, relative to the standard open source implementation, on a 4-core machine with GTX970 card (29.67 mins versus 828.35 mins on average), without sacrificing the registration accuracy. Comparing the three matching cost functions, we observed that LDDMM-CC worked the best in terms of registration accuracy, obtaining Dice overlaps larger than 0.853 for a majority of structures of interest.	graphics processing unit;image registration;loss function;parallel computing	Jiong Wu;Xiaoying Tang	2018		10.1117/12.2293082	dice;large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping;cross-correlation;square (algebra);parallel computing;acceleration;mutual information;image registration;diffeomorphism;computer science	Vision	48.31527860975668	-81.14624454776038	118203

The  conditioning of early stroke diagnosis based on CT examinations was analyzed. The multiscale extraction of the subtlest signs  of hypodensity which were often undetected in standard CT scan review was presented. Proposed method was as follows: evidence-based  description of ischemic changes, the analysis of hypodensity signs across scales, noise reduction and hypodensity extraction,  and following display of ischemic changes localized in source brain image space. Important issues were: –extension of the  brain tissues for marginal and missing space after deskulling and segmenting of unusual areas; –multiscale transform selection;  –denoising in scale-space domain; –visualization conditions fixing. Three forms of extracted stroke sings visualization were  proposed. Increased visibility of cerebral ischemia for difficult-in-diagnosis cases was experimentally noticed.

However, the skull has several openings that are filled with higher conductivity soft tissues, and through which a significant fraction of the injected current may pass. We show that current entering the brain via the orbital openings increases the electric field intensity in the cortical regions near the orbit. Furthermore, this depends on the how far electrodes are placed from the orbital openings.	electric stimulation therapy;electroconvulsive therapy;fill;molecular orbital;orbital magnetization;sarcoma;electric field;electrode	Abeye Mekonnen;Ricardo Salvador;Giulio Ruffini;Pedro Cavaleiro Miranda	2012	2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346060	neuroscience;electrical resistivity and conductivity;physics;anatomy;quantum mechanics;surgery	Visualization	26.623815557767788	-84.74898098418932	118859

The potential of particle therapy to precisely tailor the dose distribution around the target volume needs to account for the intrinsic sensitivity to uncertainties in dose deposition. These peculiar features motivate the use of image guided methods to consistently verify the accuracy in dose delivery. Dedicated imaging and image processing methods are required, from treatment planning to treatment verification phases, in order to reduce the effects of uncertainties. The scenario is also complicated by the lack of standardized layouts of treatment bunkers, which implies the relatively increased use of custom solutions. Conversely, imaging can be applied to verify the actual delivered dose, representing a valuable opportunity to validate specific protocols and visualize the efficacy of the intended treatment. In this contribution, challenges and opportunities in image guided particle therapy are overviewed, with a clear focus on research perspectives in biomedical imaging and image processing.	chemical vapor deposition;image processing;medical imaging;protocols documentation	Marco Riboldi;Guido Baroni	2015	2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319570	medicine;biological engineering;nuclear medicine;medical physics	Visualization	43.42356866302777	-84.32562544588214	118900

To this end multimodal (T1, T2 and PD-weighted) sets of MR images representing a human head and a human knee and without neoplastic formations were acquired. All the software was developed in C++ language using Open Graphics Library (OpenGL) and OpenGL Volumizer. It was tested on a Silicon Graphics O2 workstation. The medical user can rotate along the x-y-z axes the volume under investigation and zoom in and out the data, can make cuts of the set of images in all directions and display volume intersections with the three conventional anatomical planes. By enfolding the volume in a cube and by moving its apexes, the user can dig the volume. The surfaces of the anatomical districts can be visualized. The tool renders a composite volumetric image by using the false-coloring technique and it can combine morphological information of the surface and data about the nature of the volume by using the different distribution of the intensity levels of the pixels. It is also possible to set transparency to obtain an image representing simultaneously the 3D volume and its internal structure. The tool can display surface information and volume information at the same time and provides endo-navigation facility that helps the user to move into an anatomical district in order to find the correct position of potential lesions and the way to remove them.© (2001) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

b03faae20a7723f56640bd53e650608c93ee4c1d	stress analysis of osteoporotic lumbar vertebra using finite element model with microscaled beam-shell trabecular-cortical structure		Osteoporosis is a disease inwhich low bonemass andmicroarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue lead to enhanced bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture. Due to the complex anatomy of the vertebral body, the difficulties associated with obtaining bones for in vitro experiments, and the limitations on the control of the experimental parameters, finite element models have been developed to analyze the biomechanical properties of the vertebral body. We developed finite element models of the L2 vertebra, which consisted of the endplates, the trabecular lattice, and the cortical shell, for three age-related grades (young, middle, and old) of osteoporosis. The compressive strength and stiffness results revealed that we had developed a valid model that was consistent with the results of previous experimental and computational studies. The von-Mises stress, which was assumed to predict the risk of a burst fracture, was also determined for the three age groups. The results showed that the von-Mises stress was substantially higher under relatively high levels of compressive loading, which suggests that patients with osteoporosis should be cautious of fracture risk even during daily activities.	computation;dragon ball z: burst limit;experiment;finite element method;it risk;stress–strain analysis;vertebra	Yoon Hyuk Kim;Mengying Wu;Kyungsoo Kim	2013	J.

From this derives another disease among which is the diabetic foot syndrome, is the major complication. This syndrome can cause ulcers on the extremities of the patients, which because of a wrong classification and an inadequate treatment, ends in amputation or in death. Measurement of the wound originated from this syndrome specially the determination of the wounds depth, plays an important role in cases like diagnosis, classification and the treatment to apply. This article explores size depth of a wound using a light sensor over three different types of biological samples, one of them with meristematic plant tissue and the other samples with several types of biological tissues in order to observe the behavior of light on different tissues and to get closer to a usable on patients with diabetic foot syndrome. Data obtained in the experiment from the light sensor represent in a way close proximity, not only the depths wound and the possibility 3D reconstruction, but the different tissues present when the samples analyzed contained more than one tissue.

Our technique is based on the development of a new class of volumetric physics-based deformable models whose parameters are functions and can capture the local shape variation of an object. These parameters require no complex post-processing in order to be used by a physician. These volumetric models allow the accurate estimation of the shape and motion of the inner and outer walls of the LV as well as within the walls. We also present a new technique for calculating forces exerted by tagged MRI data to material points of the deformable model. Furthennore, by plotting the variations over time of the extracted LV model parameters from normal heart data we are able to quantitatively analyze and compare the epicardial and endocardial motion.	logical volume management;resonance;video post-processing;volume mesh	Jinah Park;Dimitris N.

For example, it is possible to validate DICOM meta-data information. Furthermore, knowing the relative position in a scan allows the efficient retrieval of similar slices from the same body region in other volume scans. Finally, the relative position is often an important information for a non-expert user having only access to a single CT slice of a scan. In this paper, we determine the relative position of single CT slices via instance-based regression without using any meta data. Each slice of a volume set is represented by several types of feature information that is computed from a sequence of image conversions and edge detection routines on rectangular subregions of the slices. Our new method is independent from the settings of the CT scanner and provides an average localization error of less than 4.5 cm using leave-one-out validation on a dataset of 34 annotated volume scans. Thus, we demonstrate that instance-based regression is a suitable tool for mapping single slices to a standardized coordinate system and that our algorithm is competitive to other volume-based approaches with respect to runtime and prediction quality, even though only a fraction of the input information is required in comparison to other approaches.	algorithm;dicom;edge detection;full-body ct scan;polyethylene terephthalate;refinement (computing)	Tobias Emrich;Franz Graf;Hans-Peter Kriegel;Matthias Schubert;Marisa Thoma;Alexander Cavallaro	2010		10.1117/12.841877	computer vision;edge detection;computer science;coordinate system;data mining;dicom	Vision	40.25134394669322	-82.09285521099454	119881

In this work, we develop an efficient inverse-consistent diffeomorphic registration method applying the log-Euclidean formulation of diffeomorphisms. Unlike existing log-Euclidean deformable registration approaches, the proposed method deforms two images towards each other in a completely symmetric fashion during the registration optimization, which leads to higher efficiency and better accuracy in recovering large deformations. The method is applied for the automatic segmentation of daily CT images in prostate ART. To address difficulties caused by large bladder and rectum content change, we propose further improvements and combine deformable registration with model-based image segmentation. Validation results on real clinical data showed that the proposed method gives highly accurate segmentation of interested structures.	image registration	Xiao Han;Lyndon S.

The purpose of this paper is to present a virtual reality environment for surgeons to perform virtual orthognathic surgical planning in three dimensions. A surgical planning system, “PC-based virtual reality surgical simulation for orthognathic surgery” (VRSSOS), consists of four major stages: CT data post-processing and reconstruction; 3D color facial soft tissue model generation; virtual osteotomy planning; and, soft-tissue-change simulation. The surgical planning and simulation are based on 3D CT reconstructed bone model, whereas the soft tissue prediction is based on color texture-mapped and individualized facial soft tissue model. Our approach is able to provide a quantitative osteotomy -simulated bone model and prediction of post-operative appearance with photo-realistic quality. The predicted appearance can be visualized from any arbitrary viewing point using a low-cost PC-based system.	simulation;texture mapping;video post-processing;virtual reality	James J.

In order to study the hypothesis relating power-line frequencies electromagnetic fields and childhood leukemia from a subcellular perspective, two models of bone marrow substructures exposed to electric field are computed numerically. A set of cancellous bone data obtained from computed tomography scan is computed using both the finite element method (FEM) and scalar potential finite difference method. A maximum electric field enhancement of 50% is observed. Another model of bone marrow stroma cells is implemented only in FEM using thin film approximation. The transmembrane potential (TMP) change across the gap junctions is found to range from several to over 200 /spl mu/V. The two results suggest that imperceptible contact currents can produce biologically significant TMP change at least in a limited number of bone marrow stroma cells.	anion gap:scnc:pt:bld:qn;approximation;bone marrow diseases;ct scan;cancellous bone;childhood leukemia;electroconvulsive therapy;electromagnetic fields;finite difference method;finite element method;function (biology);membrane potentials;numerical analysis;plasma membrane;star trek:;stroma;x-ray computed tomography	Roanna S.

Since the motivation for combining multiple imaging modalities is generally to improve diagnostic or prognostic accuracy, the benefits of multimodality imaging cannot be assessed through the display of example images. Instead, we must use objective, task-based measures of image quality to draw valid conclusions about system performance. In this paper, we will present a general framework for utilizing objective, task-based measures of image quality in assessing multimodality and adaptive imaging systems. We introduce a classification scheme for multimodality and adaptive imaging systems and provide a mathematical description of the imaging chain along with block diagrams to provide a visual illustration. We show that the task-based methodology developed for evaluating single-modality imaging can be applied, with minor modifications, to multimodality and adaptive imaging. We discuss strategies for practical implementing of task-based methods to assess and optimize multimodality imaging systems.	cellular automaton;class;diagram;image quality;mathematics;medical imaging;modality (human–computer interaction);multimodal imaging;statistical model;benefit;observers	Eric Clarkson;Matthew A.

Image Analysis Methods and Tools for Digital Histopathology Applications Relevant to Breast Cancer Diagnosis. Digital Comprehensive Summaries of Uppsala Dissertations from the Faculty of Science and Technology 1128. 129 pp. Uppsala: Acta Universitatis Upsaliensis. ISBN 978-91-554-8889-5. In 2012, more than 1.6 million new cases of breast cancer were diagnosed and about half a million women died of breast cancer. The incidence has increased in the developing world. The mortality, however, has decreased. This is thought to partly be the result of advances in diagnosis and treatment. Studying tissue samples from biopsies through a microscope is an important part of diagnosing breast cancer. Recent techniques include camera-equipped microscopes and whole slide scanning systems that allow for digital high-throughput scanning of tissue samples. The introduction of digital pathology has simplified parts of the analysis, but manual interpretation of tissue slides is still labor intensive and costly, and involves the risk for human errors and inconsistency. Digital image analysis has been proposed as an alternative approach that can assist the pathologist in making an accurate diagnosis by providing additional automatic, fast and reproducible analyses. This thesis addresses the automation of conventional analyses of tissue, stained for biomarkers specific for the diagnosis of breast cancer, with the purpose of complementing the role of the pathologist. In order to quantify biomarker expression, extraction and classification of sub-cellular structures are needed. This thesis presents a method that allows for robust and fast segmentation of cell nuclei meeting the need for methods that are accurate despite large biological variations and variations in staining. The method is inspired by sparse coding and is based on dictionaries of local image patches. It is implemented in a tool for quantifying biomarker expression of various sub-cellular structures in whole slide images. Also presented are two methods for classifying the sub-cellular localization of staining patterns, in an attempt to automate the validation of antibody specificity, an important task within the process of antibody generation. In addition, this thesis explores methods for evaluation of multimodal data. Algorithms for registering consecutive tissue sections stained for different biomarkers are evaluated, both in terms of registration accuracy and deformation of local structures. A novel region-growing segmentation method for multimodal data is also presented. In conclusion, this thesis presents computerized image analysis methods and tools of potential value for digital pathology applications.	acta informatica;algorithm;dictionary;digital image;high-throughput computing;image analysis;incidence matrix;international standard book number;multimodal interaction;neural coding;region growing;registered jack;sensitivity and specificity;slide rule;sparse matrix;throughput	Andreas Kårsnäs	2014			medicine;pathology;gynecology;biological engineering	Graphics	34.25272140367468	-81.33810277563735	120852

In this study, an automated computing model was developed for identifying instances of potentially excessive Z-axis coverage with abdomen-pelvis examinations. Eight patient and imaging attributes including patient gender, age, height, weight, volume CT dose index (CTDIvol), dose length product (DLP), maximum abdomen width, and maximum abdomen thickness were used to build a feedforward neural network model to predict a target Z-axis coverage whether it is an excessive or non-excessive Z-axis coverage scans. 264 CT abdomen-pelvis exams were used to develop the model which is validated using 10-fold cross validation. The result showed that 244 out of 264 exams (92.4 %) correctly predicted Z-axis excessive coverage. The promising results indicate that this tool has the potential to be used for CT exams of the chest and colon, urography, and other site-specified CT studies having defined limited length.	apache axis;artificial neural network;axis vertebra;ct scan;colon classification;computation (action);computed tomography dose index volume;cross reactions;cross-validation (statistics);dose length product;feedforward neural network;network model;patients;radiation pneumonitis;scanning;spiral cone-beam computed tomography;thickness (graph theory);urography;x-ray computed tomography;width	Min Zhang;Clinton V.

Correct estimation of spatial extent is a pre-requisite for accurate models of electrical activity, allows one to estimate current density, and enables non-invasive monitoring of functional recovery following stroke. The output of an MEG beamformer is maximum when the correct source model is used, so that the spatial extent of a source can in principal be determined through evaluation of different source models with the beamformer. Here, we simulated 275-channel MEG data using sources of varying spatial extents that followed the cortical geometry. These data were subsequently used to estimate the spatial extent of generic disc elements without knowledge of the underlying surface, and we compared these results to estimates based on cortical surface geometry (with and without error in surface location). We found that disc-shaped source models are too simplistic, particularly for areas with high curvature. For areas with low curvature spatial extent was underestimated, although on average there was a linear relationship between the true and estimated extent. In contrast, cortical surface models gave accurate predictions of spatial extent. However, adding small errors (>2 mm) to the estimated location of the cortical surface abolished this relationship between true and estimated extent, implying that accurate co-registration is needed with such models. Our results show that models exploiting surface information are necessary in order to model spatial extent and in turn current density, but in order to render such models applicable in practical situations, the accuracy of the cortical surface model itself needs to improve.	beamforming;cerebrovascular accident;estimated;magnetoencephalography;open-source software	Arjan Hillebrand;Gareth R.

On the other hand, we see that these images are visualized by means of medical displays that have much lower available number of gray shades. For a long time medical LCDs only supported 8 bits or 256 shades of gray per pixel. With the introduction of medical displays optimized for mammography, the available number of gray scales increased to 1,024. Recently, several manufacturers announced new display systems with higher bit depth. Because higher bit depth often directly results in higher display cost, it is a logical question to ask if this is required or even useful at all. This paper will give an answer by investigating several aspects such as limitations of the human visual system, digital imaging and communication in medicine grayscale standard display function calibration, and characteristics of medical LCDs.	ct scan;calibration;color depth;detectors;digital imaging;grayscale color map;mammography;palette (computing);pixel;plain x-ray;viewing angle;x-ray computed tomography;x-ray detector	Tom Kimpe;Tom Tuytschaever	2006	Journal of Digital Imaging	10.1007/s10278-006-1052-3	computer vision;x-ray detector;calibration;radiology;medicine;visual perception;computer science;computed tomography;human visual system model;medical physics;computer graphics (images)	Graphics	40.58359953670421	-88.21071117783758	120962

Understanding the nature of occlusion has important significance for the diagnosis and treatment of occlusal dysfunction and for planning reconstructive dentistry. The materials of study are 31 pairs of manually aligned dental study models. The upper and lower models are independently digitized using a laser surface scanner. Occlusion can be recovered by detecting and aligning a set of planes on the models. We describe a two-step procedure for determining the occlusal relationship using digitized dental models. The first step is a coarse alignment using four planar structures that are detected by K-means clustering, followed by principal component analysis. The second step is a refinement process using a variant of the iterative closest point technique. The quantitative results show that the algorithm is accurate, with an average measurement discrepancy of 0.74 mm between the physical and virtual models.	algorithm;cluster analysis;discrepancy function;docking (molecular);emoticon;error analysis (mathematics);ground truth;hidden surface determination;iterative closest point;iterative method;jaws scripting language;k-means clustering;nonlinear system;principal component analysis;refinement (computing);sensor	L.

To evaluate the precision of such a method to determine RBC velocity profiles, we developped a computational model of the microscopy image formation. The following steps were undertaken: (1) a mechanical model was used to mimic three dimensional RBC movements in a tubular parabolic flow; (2) at each time step, a synthetic image was built using microscopic image formation equations based on the depth of correlation of RBCs; and (3) the velocity profile was extracted by a cross-correlation algorithm applied to these synthetic images. The estimated maximum velocities extracted from the simulated images were always smaller than velocities found by simulation. Relative errors (4% to 25%) depended on the vessel radius and on the shape of the velocity profile, but not on the hematocrit or on the maximum velocity.	algorithm;computational model;cross-correlation;image formation;parabolic antenna;role-based collaboration;simulation;synthetic intelligence;velocity (software development)	Marianne Fenech;Boris Chayer;Guy Cloutier	2008	2008 5th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro	10.1109/ISBI.2008.4540955	three-dimensional space;computer vision;approximation error;medicine;fluorescence;microscopy;cross-correlation;hemodynamics;optical microscope;lens;mathematics;optics;image formation;grayscale	Vision	46.87615421084473	-85.51767415308733	121680

In this paper, we present a method for evaluating physical performance of digital medical imaging systems using mutual information which is a concept from information theory. To validate the proposed method, computer simulations were performed, followed by measuring and comparing the performance of two digital imaging systems.

However, current MSK models are often limited by their oversimplifications in anatomical geometries, sometimes lacking discrete representations of connective tissue components entirely, which ultimately affect their accuracy in biomechanical simulation. In particular, the aponeuroses - the flattened fibrous connective sheets connecting muscle fibres to tendons - have never been geometrically modeled. The initiative was thus to extend Anatomy3D - a previously developed software bundle for reconstructing muscle fibre architecture - to incorporate aponeurosis-modeling capacity. Two different algorithms for aponeurosis reconstruction were written in the MEL scripting language of the animation software Maya 6.0, using its NURBS (non-uniform rational B-splines) modeling functionality for aponeurosis surface representation. Both algorithms were validated qualitatively against anatomical and functional criteria.	3d computer graphics;algorithm;aponeurosis structure;autodesk maya;biological system;cartilage;computation;computer animation;connective tissue;ligaments;logical connective;mel scale;muscle fibers;non-uniform rational b-spline;scripting language;simulation;skeletal bone;skeletal muscle structure;tendon structure;body system	Florence T.

Since a measured MR spectrum contains the spectra of numbers of metabolites and a baseline, the separation and quantification of them becomes difficult. A nonnegative pursuit algorithm based on regularized FOCUSS algorithm is proposed here to decompose a measured spectrum with respect to an overcomplete dictionary. Benefitting from the a priori knowledge, the dictionary is built by Lorentzian and Gaussian basis functions representing different metabolites and baseline. Using this algorithm, not only the baseline is separated from the spectra of interest, but also the spectra of different metabolites are separated. The accuracy of quantification and the robustness are improved, from simulation data, compared with a commonly used estimation method [1]. The quantification on tumor metabolism with in vivo brain MR spectra is also demonstrated.	algorithm;baseline (configuration management);basis function;dictionary;minimal recursion semantics;resonance;simulation;sparse approximation;sparse matrix;spectrogram;video-in video-out	Yu Guo;Su Ruan;Gilles Millon;Jean-Marc Constans	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959618	spectrum;estimation;chromium;spectroscopy;noise;machine learning;frequency;mathematical model;mathematics;in vivo;estimation theory;statistics;robustness	Visualization	50.643160046699464	-82.66586459265577	122194

Although the use of fecal tagging improves the detection accuracy of CTC, it can introduce image artifacts that may cause lesions that are covered by fecal tagging to have a different visual appearance than those not covered by fecal tagging. This can distort the values of image-based computational features, thereby reducing the accuracy of computer-aided detection (CADe). We developed a context-specific method that performs the detection of lesions separately on lumen regions covered by air and on those covered by fecal tagging, thereby facilitating the optimization of detection parameters separately for these regions and their detected lesion candidates to improve the detection accuracy of CADe. For pilot evaluation, the method was integrated into a dual-energy CADe (DE-CADe) scheme and evaluated by use of leave-one-patient-out evaluation on 66 clinical non-cathartic low-dose dual-energy CTC (DE-CTC) cases that were acquired at a low effective radiation dose and reconstructed by use of iterative image reconstruction. There were 22 colonoscopy-confirmed lesions ≥6 mm in size in 21 patients. The DE-CADe scheme detected 96% of the lesions at a median of 6 FP detections per patient. These preliminary results indicate that the use of context-specific detection can yield high detection accuracy of CADe in non-cathartic low-dose DE-CTC examinations.	cathartics;colon classification;computation;computed tomographic colonography;distortion;dual;effective dose (radiation);feces;iterative method;iterative reconstruction;mathematical optimization;morphologic artifacts;oral cavity;patients;sensor;structure of lumen of body system;visual artifact	Janne J.

cb55c3bea5f72c3bd98acd38b2be0e509e786648	optimizing high resolution reconstruction in digital breast tomosynthesis using filtered back projection		In Digital Breast Tomosynthesis, a 3D representation of the breast is reconstructed from low-dose projection images acquired over a limited angular range. Each such image contains high level of noise which is often counteracted by a projection binning to yield the CNR desired in clinical applications. However, this approach reduces spatial resolution and makes imaging of high frequency structures such as micro-calcifications challenging. In this paper, we describe a Filtered Back Projection (FBP) reconstruction method optimized to yield improved CNR without sacrificing spatial resolution. The results from our quantitative evaluation and clinical reading by experienced radiologists indicate that the proposed methods can significantly improve contrast and sharpness of micro-calcifications and reduce noise compared to a baseline FBP method with standard filter settings.	optimizing compiler;tomosynthesis	Shiras Abdurahman;Frank Dennerlein;Anna K.

Two 5D sensors can be combined to obtain a 6D transformation similar to the ones provided by the point-based registration in optical tracking. However, estimates of the tool tip uncertainty, which we have called the target tracking error (TTE) since no registration is explicitly performed, are not available in the same manner as their optical counterpart. If the systematic bias error can be corrected and estimates of the 5D or 6D fiducial localizer error (FLE) are provided in the form of zero mean normally distributed random variables in ¿5 and ¿6, respectively, then the TTE can be modeled. In this paper, the required expressions that model the TTE as a function of the systematic bias, FLE and target location are derived and then validated using Monte Carlo simulations. We also show that the first order approximation is sufficient beyond the range of errors typically observed during an image-guided surgery (IGS) procedure. Applications of the models are described for a minimally invasive intracardiac surgical guidance system and needle-based therapy systems. Together with the target registration error (TRE) statistical models for point-based registration, the models presented in this article provide the basic framework for estimating the total system measurement uncertainty for an IGS system. Future work includes developing TRE models for commonly used registration methods that do not already have them.	arabic numeral 0;body dysmorphic disorders;brachytherapy;cell transplantation;estimated;fiducial marker;genetic translation process;guidance system;image registration;kalman filter;least squares;least-squares analysis;leucaena pulverulenta;medical image;monte carlo method;order of approximation;p-value;patients;real-time clock;real-time transcription;refractive errors;sensor;simulation;statistical model;stem cell transplant;stem cells;system of measurement;tre;tooltip;tracking system;transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation;transthoracic echocardiography;cell transformation;registration - actclass;soft tissue	Andrew D.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The postural assessment and X-ray examination of the spine, both in the frontal plane and standing position, were performed consecutively in 24 subjects. The postural assessment protocol consisted of: (1) palpation and the use of reflective markers containing lead to mark the spinous processes (SP) of the C7, T2, T4, T6, T8, T10, T12, L2, L4 and S2 vertebrae and; (2) acquisition of photographic records. First, the X-ray examinations were used to check the correlation between the palpated and marked SP and the true location of the SP of the vertebra in question, by assessing the distance between them. The spinal posture was classified based on the calculation of the scoliosis arrows in the DIPA (DIPA-SA). The X-ray examinations provided the scoliosis arrows (X-SA), the Cobb angles and the classification of spinal posture based on the Cobb angle. The results from the DIPA protocol were compared to those from the X-ray examination-based protocol. The statistical tests used were: (1) Kruskal-Wallis--differences in terms of the numerical distance between the markers and the anatomical landmarks, (2) Pearson's Correlation--DIPA-SA and Cobb angles, (3) Pearson's Correlation--X-SA and DIPA-SA; (4) Bland and Altman's graphic representation--X-SA and DIPA-SA, (5) Spearman's Correlation--classification of spinal posture obtained using the X-ray and DIPA protocols, (6) the intraclass correlation test (ICC) for the relationship between the DIPA-SA made by each evaluator (inter-evaluator), and (7) independent t-test to compare the data from the two evaluation days (intra-evaluator), α=0.05.   RESULTS There were no significant differences between the location of the anatomical points located using palpation and identified with reflective markers and the respective location of the SP as identified using X-ray exams (χ²=9.366, p=0.404). Significant correlations were found between the DIPA-SA and the Cobb angles in the dorsal (r=0.75, p<0.001) and lumbar (r=0.76, p=0.007) regions; between the DIPA-SA and the X-SA in the dorsal (r=0.79, p<0.001) and lumbar (r=0.92, p<0.001) regions and; between the classifications of posture obtained with the DIPA and X-ray protocols (r=0.804, p<0.001). Bland and Altman's representation showed agreement between DIPA-SA and X-SA for both curvatures. Significant correlations were found for the intra-evaluator test in the thoracic (r=0.99, p<0.001) and lumbar (r=0.98, p<0.001) regions; for the inter-evaluator test in the thoracic (r=0.99, p<0.001) and lumbar (r=0.88, p<0.001) regions.   CONCLUSION The results suggest that the DIPA protocol constitutes a valid simple, practical and low-cost non-invasive tool for the evaluation of the spine in the frontal plane which can be used to obtain reproducible measurements (inter and intra-evaluators).

In this paper we present an adaptive algorithm for finite element computation based on a preprocessing approach. It inverts the global stiffness matrix in a pre-computing stage and then simulates each cutting step by updating two lists of basic components iteratively with some localization techniques. This method allows a fast and physically accurate simulation of incision procedures.© (2005) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

57b4590b25337bae306f16f7af9c10ba5a8701ad	spatial and frequency domain techniques for segmentation of placido images and accuracy implications for videokeratography	placido discs;image processing;signal processing;corneal topography;videokeratography;frequency domain	OBJECTIVE Videokeratography (VK) has been a widespread technology for corneal surface analysis since the mid 1980s. Most manufactures use personal computers attached to a Placido disc apparatus in order to capture and process digital images. Although precision reported by most manufactures are within very good limits, none of them have disclosed, probably due to proprietary reasons, the nature of the algorithm used in their image-processing phase. This is a problem when researchers want to reproduce or test their own curvature or elevation algorithms on Placido images generated on different commercial videokeratographs or even compare their algorithms on data from different manufactures. Our main objective in this work was to develop certain basic techniques for Placido image edge detection and to compare the results of each algorithm in terms of precision at the image level and also the consequences for axial curvature computations. We also propose that manufactures come forward and at least explain which image-processing technique is used in their own algorithms so other researchers and laboratories can make better use of their data to improve VK algorithms.   MATERIAL/METHODS Placido images from an Eyesys system 2000 were captured for four different spherical surfaces. Each image was saved in bitmap format at the hard disk of an IBM computer. Six different image-processing algorithms were developed using different techniques well documented in the literature. The six methods were as follows: (1) first order numerical derivative, (2) first and (3) second order Fourier derivative, (4) the Marr-Hildreth filter, (5) Canny's method and (6) Mathematical Morphology. Each algorithm was tested on each of the Placido images.   RESULTS Edge radial distance from center of Placido image was compared for each algorithm and a computer simulation of the VK system. The simulated image was used as absolute reference. Another approach was to calculate Axial dioptric power using, again, well documented procedures, and compare the results for each image detection algorithm. Mean deviation in terms of pixels/millimeters/dioptric power for all spheres for methods (1-6) were, respectively, (1) 33.1695/0.7961/0.79, (2) 32.79/0.7870/0.7724, (3) 60.7150/1.4572/1.4192, (4)18.97/0.4553/0.4572, (5) 46.33/1.1119/1.0917 and (6) 20.55/0.4932/0.48.   DISCUSSION All methods have great deviation propagation in terms of dioptric power calculations when the axial algorithm is used and the absolute reference simulated edges are used to generate the calibration curves. This indicates that researchers should be more careful when using resulting image processing files from different videokeratographs to compare their own curvature or elevation algorithms among different instruments or even to measure the absolute precision of their new algorithms.

The aortic valve is identified in tracked biplane transesophageal echocardiography and used to guide stent deployment in a mixed reality environment. Additionally, a transapical delivery tool with intracardiac echocardiography capable of monitoring stent deployment was created. This system resulted in a deployment depth error of 3.4mm in a phantom. This was further improved to 2.3mm with the custom-made delivery tool. In comparison, the variability in deployment depth for traditional fluoroscopic guidance was estimated at 3.4mm.	aortic valve structure;contrast media;deploy;doppler echocardiography;echocardiography, transesophageal;guidance system;imaging phantom;ion implantation;ionizing radiation;kidney diseases;mixed reality;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;spatial variability;stent device component;transcatheter aortic valve replacement	A.

In this paper, we introduce a prototypic add-on system for enhancing the intraoperative visualization within a navigated spine surgery utilizing an extended reality approach. In essence, operation-specific important anatomical structures are segmented from preoperative patient data and superimposed on the video stream of the operation field. In addition, slices of the anatomy data, as well as shape and depth information of targeted structures, like spinal nerves or herniated discs, can be blended, which allows for a better protection of risk anatomy and accurate identification of the structures under consideration, and thus raises the safety and accuracy factors of the intervention.	add-ons for firefox;augmented reality;computational anatomy;extended reality;streaming media	Zein Salah;Bernhard Preim;Erck Elolf;Jörg Franke;Georg Rose	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-19335-4_66	simulation;engineering;biological engineering;surgery	Visualization	39.05406095716248	-86.53348811163875	122780

The standard needle implantation procedure in brachytherapy uses pre-operatively acquired image data displayed as slices on a monitor beneath the operation table. Since this information allows only a rough orientation for the surgeon, the position of the needles has to be verified repeatedly during the intervention. Within the project Medarpa a transparent display being the core component of a medical Augmented Reality (AR) system has been developed. There, pre-operatively acquired image data is displayed together with the position of the tracked instrument allowing a navigated implantation of the brachytherapy needles. The surgeon is enabled to see the anatomical information as well as the virtual instrument in front of the operation area. Thus, the Medarpa system serves as ‘window into the patient’. This paper deals with the results of first clinical trials of the system. Phantoms have been used for evaluating the achieved accuracy of the needle implantation. This has been done by comparing the output of the system (instrument positions relative to the phantom) with the real positions of the needles measured by means of a verification CT scan.	augmented reality;bmc remedy action request system;ct scan;imaging phantom;ion implantation;oled;virtual instrumentation	Stefan Wesarg;Evelyn A.

In this paper, we present a novel method for the fusion of simultaneously recorded electroencephalograms (EEG) and magnetoencephalograms (MEG) within the framework of source analysis. This method represents an extension of a previously published spatio-temporal inverse solution method to the case of MEG or combined MEG-EEG signals. Moreover, we use a state-of-the-art realistic finite element (FE) head model especially calibrated for the MEG-EEG fusion problem. Using a real data set containing an epileptic spike, we validate the source analysis results of the spatio-temporal inverse solution using the results of the LORETA method and the findings from other structural and functional modalities. We show that the proposed fusion method, despite the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of single spikes, points to the same brain area that was found by the other modalities. Furthermore, it correctly identifies the same source as the main generator for the MEG and EEG spikes.	electroencephalography;epilepsy;finite element method;kalman filter;magnetoencephalography;neuroimaging;scientific publication;signal-to-noise ratio	Laith Hamid;Umit Aydin;Carsten H.

The primary goal of our atlas is to allow the user to choose any name from the anatomical index, find the correspond­ ing object in the MRI/CT data, and visualize, manipulate in real-time and quantify it in 2-D/3-D. The atlas system provides several tools for registration, visualization, image processing and analysis, reformatting, anatomical index operations, object extraction/editing, quantification, and file handling. The atlas system is implemented in C++ and uses texture mapping. The work is a precursor to a fully computational 3-D brain model and atlases supporting function, vasculature, pathology, and brain connections.		Wieslaw Lucjan Nowinski;Anthony Fang;Bonnie T.

A physics-based model of tissue colouration provides a cross-reference between image colours and the underlying histological parameters. This approach was successfully applied to the analysis of images of pigmented skin lesions. Histological parametric maps showing the concentration of dermal and epidermal melanin, blood and collagen thickness across the imaged skin have been used to aid early detection of melanoma. A clinical study on a set of 348 pigmented lesions showed 80.1% sensitivity and 82.7% specificity.

3f5f295c784ae9e4bab4d4338c653a1bdf19a094	cell-level temperature distributions in skeletal muscle post spinal cord injury as related to deep tissue injury	pressure ulcer;rehabilitation;striated muscle;extracellular matrix;finite element;deep tissue injury;spinal cord injury;rat model;heat transfer;cross section;heat production;chronic phase;muscle fiber;skeletal muscle;temperature distribution;animal studies;muscle cell	Deep tissue injury (DTI) is a severe pressure ulcer, which initiates in skeletal muscle tissue under intact skin. Patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) are especially vulnerable to DTI, due to their impaired motosensory capacities. The underlying mechanisms that lead to DTI are, however, still poorly understood. This study focuses on cell-level temperature distributions in muscles of patients with SCI, which typically contain thinner muscle fibers and fewer capillaries. It has been shown previously by our group that ischemic muscles of rat models of DTI cool down mildly and locally, which is very likely to slow the diffusivity of metabolites in the ischemic regions. However, it is unclear how these temperature decreases affect diffusivity at the scale of individual muscle cells in the microanatomy of SCI patients. We hypothesize that a 2°C drop in the temperature of inflowing capillary blood, as shown in our animal studies, has a substantial effect on lowering the diffusivity of metabolites in skeletal muscle, but the pathological microanatomy in the chronic phase of SCI is less dominant in affecting the local temperatures in and around muscle cells. In order to test this hypothesis, two-dimensional finite element (FE) models of cross sections through the microanatomy of muscle tissue were developed using COMSOL Multiphysics software for normal and SCI muscles. The models included muscle cells, extracellular matrix (ECM), and capillaries, each with its own geometrical, thermal, and heat production properties. The SCI model configuration specifically included reduced cross section of myofibrils in favor of more ECM, less capillaries, and decreased blood inflow rate. After a 20-s heat transfer simulation, it was found that temperatures around the cells of the SCI muscle were approximately 2°C lower than that in the normal muscle, that is, heat production from the muscle cell metabolism did not compensate for the lower inflowing blood temperature in the SCI model. We conclude that the temperature and rate of inflowing capillary blood are the dominant factors determining the localized temperatures in the microarchitecture of an ischemic SCI muscle tissue. The altered SCI microanatomy was shown to be less influential. Taken together with the Stokes–Einstein theory, our results indicate that diffusivity of metabolites would be approximately 50% less around the cells of SCI muscle due to local cooling, which is yet another factor compromising tissue viability in the patients with SCI.	blood capillaries;capillary blood;capillary vessel;computer cooling;cool - action;cross section (geometry);diffusion tensor imaging;extracellular matrix;finite element method;histology;menthol 100 mg/ml / methyl salicylate 300 mg/ml topical cream;microanatomic structure;microarchitecture;multiphysics;muscle cells;muscle fibers;navier–stokes equations;other toxicity studies: metabolites;patients;portion of muscle tissue;pressure ulcer;simulation;skeletal muscle structure;soft tissue injuries;spinal cord injuries;thermogenesis;yet another	Yael Ruschkewitz;Amit Gefen	2009	Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing	10.1007/s11517-009-0566-5	pathology;mathematics;myocyte;animal studies;physics;anatomy;surgery	HCI	28.70559195986232	-85.42181451234651	123463

In particular, retinal prostheses have been implanted in a number of clinical trials for a degenerative eye disease known as retinitis pigmentosa. To date, the visual improvements in these trials have been small and not easily quantified. The aim of this paper is to highlight the inherent complexities in the assessment of visual function in the profoundly vision impaired, and discuss the potential for improvement in outcomes using image processing technology.	functional electrical stimulation;image processing;retinal implant;visual prosthesis	Lauren N.

faa0bc8425a41c6f4bbc239116c2ea23b8fef1ae	evaluation of a machine learning based model observer for x-ray ct		In the medical imaging domain, image quality assessment is usually carried out by human observers (HuO) performing a clinical task in reader studies. To overcome time-consuming reader studies numerical model observers (MO) were introduced and are now widely used in the CT research community to predict the performance of HuOs. In the recent years, machine learning based MOs showed promising results for SPECT. Therefore, we built a neural network, a socalled softmax regression model based on machine learning, as MO for x-ray CT. Performance was evaluated by comparing to one of the most prevalent MOs, the channelized Hotelling observer (CHO). CT image data labeled with confidence ratings assessed in a reader study for a detection-task of signals of different sizes, different noise levels and different reconstruction algorithms were used to train and test the MOs. Data was acquired with a clinical CT scanner. For each of four different x-ray radiation exposures, there were 208 repeated scans of a Catphan phantom. The neural network based MO (NN-MO) as well as the CHO showed good agreement with the performance in the reader study.	machine learning	Felix K. Kopp;Marco Catalano;Daniela Pfeiffer;Ernst J.

The aim of our research is to extract the vascular information from the CTP scan. This requires thin-slice CTP scans that suffer from a substantial amount of noise. Therefore noise reduction is an important prerequisite for further analysis. So far, the few noise filtering methods for 4D datasets proposed in literature deal with the temporal dimension as a 4th dimension similar to the 3 spatial dimensions, mixing temporal and spatial intensity information. We propose a bilateral noise reduction method based on time-intensity profile similarity (TIPS), which reduces noise while preserving temporal intensity information. TIPS was compared to 4D bilateral filtering on 10 patient CTP scans and, even though TIPS bilateral filtering is much faster, it results in better vessel visibility and higher image quality ranking (observer study) than 4D bilateral filtering.© (2010) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

Unfortunately, compared to commonly used computing devices, optical trackers tend to be large, heavy, and expensive devices. Compact 3D vision systems, such as Intel RealSense cameras can capture 3D pose information at several magnitudes lower cost, size, and weight. We propose to use Intel SR300 device for applications where it is not practical or feasible to use conventional trackers and limited range and tracking accuracy is acceptable. We also put forward a vertebral level localization application utilizing the SR300 to reduce risk of wrong-level surgery. METHODS: The SR300 was utilized as an object tracker by extending the PLUS toolkit to support data collection from RealSense cameras. Accuracy of the camera was tested by comparing to a high-accuracy optical tracker. CT images of a lumbar spine phantom were obtained and used to create a 3D model in 3D Slicer. The SR300 was used to obtain a surface model of the phantom. Markers were attached to the phantom and a pointer and tracked using Intel RealSense SDK’s built-in object tracking feature. 3D Slicer was used to align CT image with phantom using landmark registration and display the CT image overlaid on the optical image. RESULTS: Accuracy of the camera yielded a median position error of 3.3mm (95 percentile 6.7mm) and orientation error of 1.6 (95 percentile 4.3) in a 20x16x10cm workspace, constantly maintaining proper marker orientation. The model and surface correctly aligned demonstrating the vertebral level localization application. CONCLUSION: The SR300 may be usable for pose tracking in medical procedures where limited accuracy is acceptable. Initial results suggest the SR300 is suitable for vertebral level localization.	3dslicer;align (company);ct scan;canonical account;dendritic spine;image;imaging phantom;intel realsense;nvidia 3d vision;passive optical network;pointer (computer programming);polygonal modeling;software development kit;workspace	Rachael House;Andras Lasso;Vinyas Harish;Zachary Baum;Gabor Fichtinger	2017		10.1117/12.2255899	computer vision;simulation;spine	Vision	40.79429949232868	-84.59183899228736	123852
07b1f914324a5de251e99de66f075f85798e7c7d	understanding intensity non-uniformity in mri	circularly polarized;proton density;radio frequency;theoretical analysis	1 I n t r o d u c t i o n Intensity non-uniformity is the smooth intensity variation often seen in MR images caused by such factors as RF excitation field inhomogeneity [I], non-uniform reception coil sensitivity, eddy currents driven by field gradients [2], as well as electrodynamic interactions with the object often described as RF penetration and standing wave effects [3]. In modern MRI scanners these variations are often subtle enough that they are difficult to detect by visual inspection, however, they do affect automated image analysis techniques [4], particularly segmentation techniques that assume homogeneity of intensity within each tissue class. While initial efforts at correcting intensity non-uniformity were based on physical models or external measurements of the field variations [i, 5], these methods are not sufficiently accurate to improve upon modern volumetric scans, such as those produced of the brain using a birdcage coil. Instead, recent efforts have focused on data driven strategies [6-9] based on statistical definitions of image uniformity. However, these methods are confounded by true anatomical variation that mimics the variations caused by intensity non-uniformity. In this paper, we develop and validate, for a simple geometry, a physical model of intensity non-uniformity that has sufficient accuracy to predict the variations in a 1.5 T scanner using circularly polarized coils. While this geometry is too simple to accurately predict the variations in individual anatomical scans, it is sufficient to investigate a number of observations and hypotheses.

However, computer models of the human anatomy are often very computationally demanding, thus incompatible with the constraints of such interactive simulations. In this paper, we propose a fast model of the cardiac electrophysiology based on an eikonal formulation implemented with an anisotropic fast-marching method. We demonstrate the use of this model in the context of a simulator of radio-frequency ablation of cardiac arrhythmia from patient-specific medical imaging data. Indeed, this therapy can be very effective for patients but still suffers from a rather low success rate. Being able to test different ablation strategies on a patient-specific model can have a great clinical impact. In our setting, thanks to a haptic 3D user interface, the user can interactively measure the local extracellular potential, pace locally the myocardium or simulate the burning of cardiac tissue as done in radio-frequency ablation interventions.	3d user interaction;computer simulation;fast marching method;haptic technology;interactivity;medical imaging;radio frequency;user interface;virtual reality	Erik Pernod;Maxime Sermesant;Ender Konukoglu;Jatin Relan;Hervé Delingette;Nicholas Ayache	2011	Computers & Graphics	10.1016/j.cag.2011.01.008	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;fast marching method;virtual reality;multimedia;haptic technology;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	38.633351090481405	-85.71585989369288	123934

The correlation between corneal nerve tortuosity and pathology has been shown several times. However, because there is no unique formal definition of tortuosity, reproducibility is poor. Recently, two distinct forms of corneal nerve tortuosity have been identified, describing either short-range or long-range direc‐ tional changes. Using 30 images and their manual grading provided by 7 experts, we automatically traced corneal nerves with a custom computerized procedure and identified the combination of geometrical measurements that best represents each tortuosity definition (Spearman Rank Correlation equal to 0.94 and 0.88, respectively). Then, we evaluated both of these tortuosity indexes in 100 images from 10 healthy and 10 diabetic subjects (5 images per subject). A Linear Discriminant Analysis showed a very good capability (accuracy 85%) to differ‐ entiate healthy subjects from pathological ones by using both tortuosity indexes together.	linear discriminant analysis;optic nerve (gchq);sacral nerve stimulation;video-in video-out	Fabio Scarpa;Alfredo Ruggeri	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-67561-9_25	tortuosity;ophthalmology;specular microscopy;spearman's rank correlation coefficient;reproducibility;linear discriminant analysis;correlation;medicine	Web+IR	35.07627617327845	-81.5485914011931	124369

At first, a computational a trial model was built from MRI images of a male volunteer, and was discretized into spherical units in a spherical coordinate. Then, the anisotropy of conduction velocity and electrical conductivity were incorporated into the special conduction system of this model. The action potential of each cell was simulated based on the Nygren cell model. Furthermore, action potential and conduction velocity restitutions were also introduced to the model. The simulation results demonstrated that non-transmural maze III ablation procedure can achieve the same effect as the transmural ablation if the positions of ablation lines are reasonable. This study may provide theoretical hints and evidence for the usefulness of maze III ablation procedure in the treatment of chronic a trial fibrillation.	action potential;computation;computer simulation;discretization;maze generation algorithm;nicklas nygren;velocity (software development)	Xin Zhu;Di Yang;Weijia Lu;Wenxi Chen;Daming Wei;Koji Fukuda;Hiroaki Shimokawa	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology	10.1109/CIT.2014.37	real-time computing;computer science;nerve conduction velocity;atrial fibrillation;cathode;control theory;fibrillation;ablation	Robotics	30.263775343958038	-85.63498788809486	124575
0f1af5aaf7587a0428f66f1189dccab157b6006f	hierarchical hybrid shape representation for medical shapes		Recently, shape analysis has become of increasing interest in the medical community due to its potential in capturing the morphological variations across a population. The high quality 3D images captured can be used to extract 3D shape of the organs. 3D models of organs can also be used for training personnel, for visualization during image guided interventions and in simulations. A compact shape model that has implicit and explicit forms will aid in some of these medical use-cases. We propose a compact hybrid shape model as a combination of Extended Superquadrics (ESQ) [1] and Radial basis interpolation function (RBF). The hybrid shape model in its parametric form is given as ( f (θ ,φ)= h(θ ,φ)+g(θ ,φ)). h is the extended superquadric function and g is radial basis interpolation function.

Establishing the correspondence between a large number of data points is a computationally intensive process. Some point matching related applications, such as medical image registration, require real time or near real time performance if applied to critical clinical applications like image assisted surgery. In this paper, we report a new multicore platform based parallel algorithm for fast point matching in the context of landmark based medical image registration. We introduced a non-regular data partition algorithm which utilizes the K-means clustering algorithm to group the landmarks based on the number of available processing cores, which optimize the memory usage and data transfer. We have tested our method using the IBM Cell Broadband Engine (Cell/B.E.) platform. The results demonstrated a significant speed up over its sequential implementation. The proposed data partition and parallelization algorithm, though tested only on one multicore platform, is generic by its design. Therefore the parallel algorithm can be extended to other computing platforms, as well as other point matching related applications.	cell (microprocessor);cluster analysis;computation (action);computer vision;data point;full scale;generalization (psychology);generic drugs;image registration;inclusion body myositis (disorder);k-means clustering;less than;matching;medical image;multi-core processor;nonlinear system;parallel algorithm;parallel computing;real-time computing;thomas j. watson research center;united states national institutes of health;watson (computer);biomedical engineering field;funding grant;registration - actclass;statistical cluster	Lin Yang;Leiguang Gong;Hong Zhang;John L.

To increase sensitivity while maintaining spatial resolution, we designed and constructed a multi-pinhole collimator array to replace the parallel hole collimators of a Ceraspect human SPECT brain scanner. The Ceraspect scanner is composed of an annular NaI(Tl) crystal within which the eight pinhole collimators (1-mm-diameter holes) rotate while projecting nonoverlapping images of the object onto the stationary annular crystal. In this manner, only one-eighth of a collimator rotation is required to acquire a full circle orbit tomographic data set. The imaging field of view (FOV) has a diameter of 25.6 mm in the transverse direction, which is sufficient to encompass a mouse in the transverse direction. The axial FOV is 25.6 mm at the center of the FOV and 13.9 mm at the edge of the transverse FOV. Data are currently acquired in step-and-shoot mode; however, the system is capable of list mode acquisition with the collimator continuously rotating. Images are reconstructed using a cone-beam ordered subsets expectation maximization method. The reconstructed spatial resolution of the system is 1.7 mm and the sensitivity at the center of the FOV is 13.8 cps/microCi. A whole-body bone scan of a mouse injected with [Tc-99 m]MDP clearly revealed skeletal structures such as the ribs and vertebral bodies. These preliminary results suggest that this approach is a good tradeoff between resolution and sensitivity and, with further refinement, may permit dynamic imaging in living animals.	bone scintigraphy;bone structure of rib;bone structure of spine;ct scan;collimator device component;collimator devices;diameter (qualifier value);dynamic imaging;expectation–maximization algorithm;field of view in video games;gamma cameras;gamma camera;image resolution;numerous;order (action);photons;radioisotope scan of bone;recombinant interferon-gamma;refinement (computing);scanner device component;scanning systems;stationary process;tomography, emission-computed;tomography, emission-computed, single-photon;transverse wave	Andrew L.

The extended ve-layer model makes it possible to derive parameters characterising the thickness and pigment composition of the skin layers from calibrated colour and infrared images of skin lesions. The extracted parameters can be used to reconstruct a full 3-dimensional model of the skin architecture which conveys information grossly comparable to that available through microscopical examination of biopsied skin tissue. This work forms a part of research at the University of Birmingham into developing theories and techniques which aim to aid clinicians in the early diagnosis of malignant melanoma. Our previous paper [2] presented a model of colour formation within normal human skin. The model is based on the Kubelka-Munk theory [5] of scattering and absorption within inhomogeneous materials and the physics pertaining to their colour properties. By considering the skin to be a layered construction of such materials, the stratum corneum, epidermis, papillary dermis and reticular dermis, and by exploiting the physics related to the optical interface between these layers, the model generates all possible colours occurring within normal human skin. In particular, the model predicts that all normal skin colours lie on a simple curved surface patch within a three-dimensional colour space bounded by two physiologically meaningful axes, one corresponding to the amount of melanin within the epidermis and the other to the amount of blood within the dermis. The model postulated that abnormal skin conditions would cause the skin colours to deviate from the predicted surface in the colour space. This paper exploits this idea further. In particular, it demonstrates that it is possible to derive detailed information about the internal skin architecture and composition grossly comparable to information available through the microscopical examination of tumour tissue but without incurring the problems inherent in obtaining a biopsy. The central premise explored here is, therefore, that as abnormal skin often has a di erent internal architecture to normal skin it is a fair proposition that the coloration may not be bounded to this surface; if this is true, then the nature of the deviation may yield important information about the skin architecture. To explore this the model presented in the previous paper was extended to predict the skin coloration associated with conditions where melanocytes penetrate into the dermis. These are commonly seen in such conditions as the benign blue nevus and invasive skin cancer, such as melanomas, often leading to the blue hues characteristic with these conditions [1]. The \form"""" and depth of this invasion is an extremely important diagnostic factor in determining the nature of a skin lesion and, if abnormal, the relevant treatment and prognosis; currently the only reliable method of obtaining this information is by biopsy. To account for the architectural distortion where dermal melanocytes occupy a region of the papillary dermis the model of normal skin needed to be extended to include additional layers. As can be seen from Figure 1, there are now ve distinct layers which can be combined to construct an extended model: a layer within the upper papillary dermis containing no melanin; a layer within the upper papillary dermis containing melanin; a layer within the lower papillary dermis containing melanin; and a layer within the lower papillary dermis containing no melanin and nally the epidermis. The extended model [3] speci es how the magnitude of any colour primary depends on these model parameters thus allowing exploration of the coloration expected for various skin conditions. A rst such \computational experiment"""" modelled in vitro dermal tissue, that is bloodless skin with the epidermis removed. This analysis showed that the coloration \does indeed move o the surface corresponding to normal skin"""" in situations where melanocytes have penetrated the dermis. Further analysis led to the conclusion that \In principle, therefore, if presented with a section of in vitro dermis it should be possible to assess both the presence, concentration and position of melanocytes by an examination of the coloration"""" [3]. For such an approach to be useful when applied to living, in vivo, tissue it was necessary to include the e ect of both melanin absorption within the epidermis and blood within the dermis. The result of this analysis showed that although the amount of blood could be quanti ed directly through an analysis of the remitted skin colour, when combined with dermal penetration of melanocytes, the amount of epidermal melanin could not. It was, however, possible to ascertain that \an amount"""" of dermal invasion had occurred, thus allowing areas of normal and abnormal skin to be segmented, but it was impossible to unravel the relative amounts of each. To gain insight into the internal architecture therefore requires that either the amount of epidermal melanin, penetration of dermal melanocytes or the concentration of these melanocytes are known. If one of these parameters can be speci ed then it becomes possible to disentangle the other two from a measure of the coloration. Through further research it is hoped to be able to measure one of these parameters directly for every point within a lesion image. At present, however, the following approach has been adopted. First, the normal areas of skin are identi ed that is areas with no dermal penetration of melanocytes and within these areas the amount of epidermal melanin is ascertained; this is then followed by an interpolation of these surrounding melanin values into the abnormal areas. This approach assumes that the amount of epidermal melanin does not change by a signi cant amount within these areas or if it does it varies 3 In normal skin melanocytes are restricted to the epidermis. in a predictable manner thus allowing the variation to be modelled. As described in [3] however it is necessary to ascertain one further parameter before such analysis can be undertaken. This parameter, the papillary dermal thickness, has a pronounced e ect on the light remitted from a skin lesion. Indeed the change in coloration due to a variation in this parameter is almost identical to that due to melanocytic descent thus leading to lesions only varying in this parameter being wrongly classi ed. As an example it is possible to nd malignant invasive melanomas with an identical coloration to that of simple warts. This result casts doubt on the e ectiveness of using purely colour information in the diagnosis of malignant melanoma and may o er itself as an explanation for the \moderate success achieved"""" by Umbaugh et al. [6] when they attempted to classify lesion types by an investigation of coloration. However, this is not to dismiss the usefulness of colour information when combined with other extracted lesion features such as that demonstrated by Dhawan and Sicsu [4] when they combined colour with a texture analysis; and Umbaugh et al. [7] when they applied arti cial intelligence techniques to variations in lesion colour. From the extended skin model the variation of remitted light with papillary dermal thickness can be ascertained. Therefore if this thickness were known for each image point it should be possible to calculate a transformation that adjusts the measured coloration to that of any speci ed papillary dermal thickness thus removing the metameric problems previously discussed. The problem, therefore, is how can the papillary dermal thickness be measured noninvasively? In formulating a solution to this problem it is useful to recall that the amount of light remitted from the skin becomes highly dependent upon this factor as the wavelength increases [3]. When this is combined with the observation that both melanin and blood absorption drop signi cantly with increasing wavelength it seems it may be possible to nd a wavelength range where the amount of remitted light depends largely on the papillary dermal thickness. This is never the case within the visible portion of the spectrum. However, it becomes plausible if the considered wavelength range is extended into the infrared. For instance, in the wavelength range 600{800 nm the absorption of melanin drops to around one tenth of its peak within the visible portion of the spectrum; the absorption of blood drops by around a factor of a hundred whilst the sensitivity of remitted light to variations in papillary dermal thickness increases. This di erence becomes even more marked as longer wavelengths are considered; for example, the absorption of melanin drops by a further order of magnitude in the wavelength range 800{1000 nm. Indeed, within these wavelength ranges the thickness of the papillary dermis is the major parameter a ecting skin coloration. As these wavelength ranges are easily accessible with existing infrared lm and infrared digital cameras it should be possible to use this information to provide the desired calibration. As an example of how this may be performed consider Figure 1 where the intensity of remitted light for in vivo skin between 600{800 nm is plotted against that measured between 800{1000 nm. As can be seen from this graph the amount of remitted light falls, with increasing melanin, faster for the 600{800 nm primary than for the 800{1000 nm primary. This is as one would expect; more interesting, however, is the signi cant variation in both primaries with papillary dermal thickness. This observation then allows construction of the lines of constant papillary dermal thickness as shown in the graph. A measurement of this thickness parameter can thus be recovered by obtaining images acquired within the given wavelength ranges and looking-up the corresponding papillary dermal thickness from the graph."""	color space;digital camera;distortion;interpolation;pigment;theory;thickness (graph theory);video-in video-out;while	Symon Cotton;Ela Claridge;Per Hall	1997		10.1007/3-540-63046-5_50	iterative reconstruction;three-dimensional space;computer vision;systems modeling;radiology;color image;pigment;mathematics;structural analysis;skin	Vision	47.78537133036554	-85.9597540401714	125014

Advances in MRI technology enable acquisition of 4D blood-flow data, providing quantitative blood-flow velocities over time. The currently typical slice-by-slice analysis requires a full mental reconstruction of the unsteady blood-flow field, which is a tedious and highly challenging task, even for skilled physicians. We endeavor to alleviate this task by means of comprehensive visualization and interaction techniques. In this paper we present a framework for pre-clinical cardiovascular research, providing tools to both interactively explore the 4D blood-flow data and depict the essential blood-flow characteristics. The framework encompasses a variety of visualization styles, comprising illustrative techniques as well as improved methods from the established field of flow visualization. Each of the incorporated styles, including exploded planar reformats, flow-direction highlights, and arrow-trails, locally captures the blood-flow dynamics and may be initiated by an interactively probed vessel cross-section. Additionally, we present the results of an evaluation with domain experts, measuring the value of each of the visualization styles and related rendering parameters.	approximation algorithm;blood vessel tissue;clinical use template;color mapping function;hotfix;imagery;interaction technique;interactivity;random seed;real-time clock;seeding;subject-matter expert;tracing (software);emotional dependency	Roy van Pelt;Javier Oliván Bescós;Marcel Breeuwer;Rachel E.

MRI or multi modality studies produce several different images of a given cross-section of the body, each providing different levels of contrast sensitivity between different tissues. The question then arises as to how to present this wealth of data to the diagnostician. While each of the different images may be misleading (as illustrated later by an example), in combination they may contain the correct information. Unfortunately, a human observer is not likely to be able to extract this information when presented with a parallel display of the distinct images. Given the sequential nature of detailed visual examination of a picture, a human observer is quite ineffective at integrating complex visual data from parallel sources. The development of a display technology that overcomes this difficulty by synthesizing a display method matched to the capabilities of the human observer is the subject of this paper. The ultimate goal of diagnostic imaging is the detection, localization, and quantification of abnormality. An intermediate goal, which is the one we address, is to present the diagnostician with an image that will maximize his changes to classify correctly different regions in the image as belonging to different tissue types. Our premise is that the diagnostician is able to bring to bear all his knowledge and experience, which are difficult to capture in a computer program, on the final analysis process. This is often key to the detection of subtle and otherwise elusive features in the image. We therefore rule out the generation of an automatically segmented image, which not only fails to include this knowledge, but also would deprive the diagnostician of the opportunity to exercise it, by presenting him with a hard-labeled segmentation. Instead we concentrate on the fusion of the multiple images of the same cross-section into a single most informative grey-scale image.© (1992) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

While the S is an update on the daVinci surgical system it has significantly different structures. This led to the belief that there might be differences in the accuracy and precision of the daVinci-S as compared to the daVinci “classic”. In a previous study, we measured the accuracy of the daVinci “classic” to be 1.02 mm throughout its work volume (Kwartowitz et al. in Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg 1:159–165, 2006) In this study we evaluated the accuracy of the daVinci-S using the same protocol as was used for the daVinci “classic”. The localization error is found to be 1.05 mm, which is essentially the same as the measured error for the daVinci “classic”. It is concluded that the daVinci-S is an appropriate localizer for a robotic image guided surgery (RIGS) system.	high-level programming language;next-generation network;robot;texas instruments davinci	David Morgan Kwartowitz;S.

5ff50fe5a69cc89400b2abfa78dcbe04ffb5e2c4	empirical quantification and modeling of muscle deformation: toward ultrasound-driven assistive device control * this work was supported by the nsf national robotics initiative (award no. 81774), siemens healthcare (85993), and the nsf graduate research fellowship program.		Surface electromyography is currently the sensing modality of choice for control of biosignal-driven prostheses and exoskeletons; however, the sensor's noisy and aggregate nature inhibits collection of distinguishable signal streams to robustly manipulate multiple device degrees of freedom (DoF). We here explore 2D B-mode ultrasound as an alternative source of muscle activation data (namely, muscle deformation) that can be more precisely localized, allowing for the theoretical collection of multiple naturally-varying signals that could be used to control high-DoF assistive devices. We here present a proof-of-concept study showing a) the observability of muscle deformation via ultrasound, and b) novel descriptions of the spatially-varying nature of the signal. These analyses are accomplished through the study of nine volumetric scans of the biceps brachii under varied elbow angle and loading conditions, collected and spatially localized using an ultrasound scanner and motion capture. We here establish the feasibility of measuring several force-associated deformation signals (including muscle cross-sectional area and thickness) via real-time ultrasound scanning and quantify the spatial variation of these signals. Additionally, we propose future applications for both our signal characterizations and the generated muscle volume data set, including better design of assistive device sensor locations and validation of existing muscle deformation models.††A visual summary of the work described can be found in the accompanying video abstract.	aggregate data;assistive technology;cross-sectional data;electromyography;emoticon;ibm notes;medical ultrasound;modality (human–computer interaction);motion capture;real-time locating system;robotics;signal-to-noise ratio;thickness (graph theory)	Laura A.

Challenges to ultrasound-guided interventions arise, however, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the imaging artifacts created by the interventional instruments. Metallic instruments, in particular, are strong scatters and so produce a variety of artifacts. For many interventions, the manual or robotic instrument is comprised of a long curved tubular structure with specialized tooling at its tip. Toward the goal of developing a surgical navigation system, this paper proposes an image processing algorithm for enhancing the tubular structure of imaged instruments while also reducing imaging artifacts. Experiments are presented to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach in the context of robotic instruments whose shape comprises a smooth curve along their length.	diameter (qualifier value);entity class - imaging modality;experiment;image processing;instrument - device;medical ultrasound;morphologic artifacts;navigation;robot;signal-to-noise ratio;surgical instruments;algorithm	Hongliang Ren;Pierre E.

We exploit the fact that the spatio-temporal data can be represented as the linear combination of a few temporal basis functions. The current approaches that capitalize this property estimate the basis functions from central phase encodes, acquired with a fine temporal sampling rate. In contrast, we estimate the basis functions from the entire under-sampled data. By eliminating the need for training data, the proposed method can achieve potentially high acceleration factors. More importantly, the estimation of the temporal functions from the entire data significantly improves the quality of the basis functions, which inturn improves the quality of the reconstructions. Experiments on numerical phantoms show a significant reduction in artifacts at high acceleration factors, in comparison to current schemes.	algorithm;basis function;experiment;numerical analysis;radial (radio);real-time clock;real-time transcription;sampling (signal processing);sparse matrix	Sajan Goud Lingala;Yue Hu;Mathews Jacob	2010	2010 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro	10.1109/ISBI.2010.5490154	iterative reconstruction;acceleration;sampling;computer vision;training set;radiology;medicine;computer science;basis function;magnetic resonance imaging;mathematics;heart	EDA	50.18808138737604	-81.11462834040813	125787

In these procedures, the facial bones are cut into several fragments and relocated to give the patient a more normal facial appearance. There is a significant synergy between better presurgical planning methods and the ability to execute the plans precisely and efficiently. The planning component of our system will transform CT images into a 3D geometric model of the patient's skull and assists the surgeon in planning an optimal procedure based on an analysis of the patient's anatomy compared to a database of normal anatomy. The surgical component will use realtime sensing to register the modelbased surgical plan with the reality in the operating room. It will employ a variety of manmachine interface modalities (graphics, synthesized speech, etc.) together with passive manipulation aids to assist the surgeon in precise execution of his plan. This paper describes the overall system architecture, the proposed surgical procedure, implementation status, and some early experiments that we have performed.	ct scan;experiment;geometric modeling;graphics;speech synthesis;synergy;systems architecture	Russell H.

The method uses the laser markers readily available on any CT scanner and does not require imaging thus eliminating radiation exposure. Its accuracy is inherited from the laser positioning system. This approach does not require additional hardware, laser alignment being performed on the instrument used in the clinical application. Moreover, robotic guidance allows for radiological interventions to be performed on scanners without fluoro-CT capability. Unlike the manual approach, the method allows for performing oblique insertions, for which the skin entry point and the target are located in different slices. The implementation is realized using the latest version of the PAKY-RCM robot developed in our laboratory. This is an increased precision system based on our new Ball-Worm technology. The system was successfully used for five CT-guided biopsy and radiofrequency ablation procedures on the kidney and spine and a nephrostomy tube placement. Further investigation will explore its application to other organs and procedures.	algorithm;ct scan;charge trap flash;entry point;experiment;fiducial marker;heart rate variability;oblique projection;positioning system;radio frequency;radiology;reliability-centered maintenance;robot;tomography	Alexandru Patriciu;Stephen B.

A minimally invasive surgical technique has recently been proposed-percutaneous cochlear access-in which a single hole is drilled from the skull surface to the cochlea. For the method to be feasible, a safe and effective drilling trajectory must be determined using a pre-operative CT. Segmentation of the structures of the ear would improve trajectory planning safety and efficiency and enable the possibility of automated planning. Two important structures of the ear, the facial nerve and chorda tympani, present difficulties in intensity based segmentation due to their diameter (as small as 1.0 and 0.4 mm) and adjacent inter-patient variable structures of similar intensity in CT imagery. A multipart, model-based segmentation algorithm is presented in this paper that accomplishes automatic segmentation of the facial nerve and chorda tympani. Segmentation results are presented for 14 test ears and are compared to manually segmented surfaces. The results show that mean error in structure wall localization is 0.2 and 0.3 mm for the facial nerve and chorda, proving the method we propose is robust and accurate.	image registration	Jack H.

With this system, CT cut-views and segmented objects such as tumors that have been previously extracted from preoperative tomographic images can be directly displayed as augmented reality overlays on the microscope image. The novelty of this design stems from the inclusion of a precise mini-tracker directly on the microscope. This device, which is rigidly mounted to the microscope, is used to track the movements of surgical tools and the patient. In addition to an accuracy gain, this setup offers improved ergonomics since it is much easier for the surgeon to keep an unobstructed line of sight to tracked objects. We describe the components of the system: microscope calibration, image registration, tracker assembly and registration, tool tracking, and augmented reality display. The accuracy of the system has been measured by validation on plastic skulls and cadaver heads, obtaining an overlay error of 0.7 mm. In addition, a numerical simulation of the system has been done in order to complement the accuracy study, showing that the integration of the tracker onto the microscope could lead to an improvement of the accuracy to the order of 0.5 mm. Finally, we describe our clinical experience using the system in the operation room, where three operations have been performed to date.	augmented reality;ct scan;cadaver;computer simulation;human factors and ergonomics;image registration;numerical analysis;tracking system	Jaime Garcia Giraldez;Marco Caversaccio;Ion Pappas;Jens Kowal;Urs Rohrer;Gaëtan Marti;Charles Baur;Lutz-Peter Nolte;Miguel Ángel González Ballester	2006	International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery	10.1007/s11548-006-0066-0	computer vision;augmented reality;simulation;tracking system;computer science;image registration;artificial intelligence;tracking;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	40.80787520057804	-85.23477238384952	126087

A system was developed to provide a virtual reality (VR) environment that integrates pre-operative imaging, real-time intra-operative guidance using 2D trans-esophageal ultrasound, and models of the surgical tools tracked using a magnetic tracking system. Detailed 3D dynamic cardiac models were synthesized from high-resolution pre-operative MR data and registered within the intra-operative imaging environment. The feature-based registration technique was employed to fuse pre- and intra-operative data during in vivo intracardiac procedures on porcine subjects. This method was found to be suitable for in vivo applications as it relies on easily identifiable landmarks, and hence, it ensures satisfactory alignment of pre- and intra-operative anatomy in the region of interest (4.8 mm RMS alignment accuracy) within the VR environment. Our initial experience in translating this work to guide intracardiac interventions, such as mitral valve implantation and atrial septal defect repair demonstrated feasibility of the methods.

They comprise, e.g., Fundus photography, optical coherence tomography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Yet, these images are often complementary and do express the same pathologies in a different way. Some pathologies are only visible in a particular modality. Thus, it is beneficial for the ophthalmologist to have these modalities fused into a single patient-specific model. The goal of this paper is a fusion of Fundus photography with segmented MRI volumes. This adds information to MRI that was not visible before like vessels and the macula. This paper contributions include automatic detection of the optic disc, the fovea, the optic axis, and an automatic segmentation of the vitreous humor of the eye.	apache axis;blood vessel;ct scan;eye;gastric fundus carcinoma in situ;magnetic resonance imaging;modality (human–computer interaction);multimodal interaction;optic disk;pathology;patients;vitreous humor;x-ray computed tomography	Sandro De Zanet;Carlos Ciller;Tobias Rudolph;Philippe Maeder;Francis L.

The collected OCT data was divided into three distinct groups: healthy subjects, DME patients with significantly increased outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness and DME patients without visible changes in the ONL. For each group, the ONL was segmented and processed, yielding a representative A-scan. Using reference values for the physical and optical characteristics of the healthy human retina, we used a Monte Carlo method with a model for the ONL to simulate an A-scan for each group and compare it to the real OCT data. This allowed to identify which alterations in the cellular characteristics are responsible for the changes observed in the OCT scans of the diseased groups.	icl direct machine environment;monte carlo method;online and offline;simulation;thickness (graph theory);tomography;tree accumulation;video-in video-out	Antonio Correia;Luís Pinto;Adérito Araújo;Sílvia Barbeiro;Francisco Caramelo;Paulo Menezes;António Miguel Morgado;Pedro Serranho;Rui Bernardes	2014	IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI)	10.1109/BHI.2014.6864466	computer vision;optics;physics;medical physics	Visualization	45.87147805858042	-86.09760768723817	126826

There is currently no clear consensus over the circumstances in which this added spectral data may improve computer-aided interpretation and diagnosis of imaged pathology specimens [1, 2, 3]. Two spectra which are perceived as the same color are called metamers, and the collection of all such spectra are referred to as the metamer set. Highly metameric colors are amenable to separation through multispectral imaging (MSI). Using the transformation between the spectrum and its perceived color, our work addresses the question of when MSI reveals information not represented by a standard RGB color image. An analytical estimate on the size of the metamer set is derived for the case of independent spectral absorption. It is shown that colors which are closest to the white point on the chromaticity diagram are highly metameric. A numerical method to estimate the metamer set in a domain-specific manner is provided. The method is demonstrated on multispectral data sets of imaged peripheral blood smears and breast tissue microarrays. An a priori estimate on the degree of metamerism from a standard color image is presented.	addresses (publication format);color image;diagram;erewhon;histopathology;mammary gland parenchyma;microarray;multispectral imaging;n-methylsuccinimide;numerical method;peripheral;specimen	William J.

The reconstruction of these patients should consider functional aspects as well as aesthetical ones. Therefore, a virtual reality system which allows bone cutting, ostheotomy planning, calculation of implants for soft tissue and bones, combined with the calculation of the post-operative appearance, is needed.	virtual reality	Oliver Burgert;Sascha Seifert;Tobias Salb;Roland Unterhinninghofen;Tilo Gockel;Rüdiger Dillmann;Stefan Haßfeld;Joachim Mühling	2003			radiology;soft tissue;medicine	ML	38.42021007500418	-85.01495391533443	126909

Events are triggered by rupture of atheromatic plaques, as a result of disruption of the overlying fibrous cap. Pathological studies have shown that cap thickness is a critical component of plaque stability. Therefore, assessment of fibrous cap thickness could be a valuable tool for esti- mating the risk of future events. To aid preoperative planning and peri- operative decision making, intracoronary optical coherence tomography imaging can provide very detailed information about arterial wall struc- ture. However, manual interpretation of the images is laborious, subject to variability, and therefore not always sufficiently reliable for immediate decision of treatment. We present a novel semi-automatic computerized interventional imaging tool to quantify coronary fibrous cap thickness in optical coherence tomography. The most challenging issue when estimat- ing cap thickness is caused by the diffuse nature of the anatomical ablu- minal interface to be detected. Our method can successfully extract the fibrous cap contours using a robust dynamic programming framework based on ag eometrical ap riori. Validated on a dataset of 90 images from 11 patients, our method provided a good agreement for minimum cap thickness with the reference tracings performed by a medical expert (35.7 ± 33.3 µm, R=.68) and was similar to inter-observer reproducibil- ity (35.2 ± 33.1 µm, R=.66), while being significantly faster and fully reproducible. This tool demonstrated promising performances and could potentially be used for online identification of high risk-plaques.	intracoronary optical coherence tomography;semiconductor industry;thickness (graph theory)	Guillaume Zahnd;Antonios Karanasos;Gijs van Soest;Evelyn Regar;Wiro J.

Although this shift has motivated the modification of many current surgical procedures, there remains a great deal of room for improvement. We present a new methodological component for tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) repair that aims to improve long-term outcomes. The current gold standard for TOF repair involves the use of echocardiography (ECHO) for measuring the pulmonary valve (PV) diameter. This is then used, along with other factors, to formulate a Z-score that drives surgical preparation. Unfortunately this process can be inaccurate and requires a mid-operative confirmation that the pressure gradient across the PV is not excessive. Ideally, surgeons prefer not to manipulate the PV as this can lead to valve insufficiency. However, an excessive pressure gradient across the valve necessitates surgical action. We propose the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to improve preparation for TOF repair. In our study, pre-operative CT data were segmented and reconstructed, and a virtual surgical operation was then performed to simulate post-operative conditions. The modified anatomy was used to drive CFD simulation. The pressure gradient across the pulmonary valve was calculated to be 9.24mmHg, which is within the normal range. This finding indicates that CFD may be a viable tool for predicting post-operative pressure gradients for TOF repair. Our proposed methodology would remove the need for mid-operative measurements that can be both unreliable and detrimental to the patient.	ct pulmonary angiogram;computation;computational fluid dynamics;convergence insufficiency;fleming valve;gradient;image processing;page view;simulation;video-in video-out	Jonathan D Plasencia;Haithem Babiker;Randy Richardson;Edward Rhee;B Cicero Willis;John Nigro;David Cleveland;David H.

Since the patient’s brain shifts during many OR procedures, we have developed a physically based deformation model to update images concurrent with surgery in order to achieve nonrigid registration between the brain and the preoperative scans. In this paper, we introduce a strategy for integrating sparse displacement data acquired during surgery with the computational model using an efficient and accurate approach. The complex boundary conditions that exist during surgery are estimated from sparse data through a synthesis of simpler precomputed sets of model basis solutions. These basis solutions are weighted in accordance with a minimization procedure that reduces the error between the observed and computed displacement fields. This method appears to be a promising technique for increasing the speed and accuracy of the computational estimate, thus making intraoperative updates more efficient. Furthermore, it has the advantage of incorporating intraoperatively acquired measurements of true displacements into the model to ensure a more accurate estimation of tissue motion. Results from in vivo pig brain experiments involving multiple retractions show that full volume deformation fields can be constructed throughout a series of retraction events from a single set of basis solutions with equal or increased accuracy.

The clinical objective of it is to maximize thermal damage to upper dermis while minimizing injury to the epidermis and to decrease potential complications. But many the complications also exist in the clinic. In this study, we developed a new approach to monitor the response of skin tissue irradiated by IPL and measured the attenuation coefficient between the change of the tissue optical properties utilizing fiber based on optical coherence tomography(OCT) technology and conventional histology. OCT is a well-established optical imaging technique that uses low coherence interferometry to produce micrometer-scale resolution images of biological media. The outcome shows that the attenuation coefficient increase after irradiated and then gradually reduces with times; the changes of the total attenuation coefficient increase with the dose.

A dipole representation of the transmembrane current in a three-dimensional muscle volume was used to estimate detected individual muscle fiber action potentials. The effects of anisotropic muscle conductance, innervation zone location, propagation velocity, fiber length, electrode area, and electrode configuration were included in the fiber action potential model. A motor unit action potential was assumed to be the sum of the individual muscle fiber action potentials. A computational procedure, based on the notion of isopotential layers, was developed which substantially reduced the calculation time required to estimate motor unit action potentials. The simulations indicated that: 1) only those motor units with muscle fibers located within 10–12 mm of the electrodes would contribute significant signal energy to the surface EMG, 2) variation in surface area of electrodes has little effect on the detection depth of motor unit action potentials, 3) increased interelectrode spacing moderately increases detection depth, and 4) the frequency content of action potentials decreases steeply with increased electrode-motor unit territory distance.	action potentials;action potential;assumed;conductance (graph);electromyography;moderate response;motor unit;muscle fibers;myalgia;simulation;software propagation;spacing;spectral density;tissue fiber;velocity (software development);anatomical layer;electrode;nerve supply	Andrew J.

6e02fda2e2583fada91c6617185443238c43e34c	statistical characterization of noise for spatial standardization of ct scans: enabling comparison with multiple kernels and doses	computerized tomography;non-stationary noise;statistical characterization	Computerized tomography (CT) is a widely adopted modality for analyzing directly or indirectly functional, biological and morphological processes by means of the image characteristics. However, the potential utilization of the information obtained from CT images is often limited when considering the analysis of quantitative information involving different devices, acquisition protocols or reconstruction algorithms. Although CT scanners are calibrated as a part of the imaging workflow, the calibration is circumscribed to global reference values and does not circumvent problems that are inherent to the imaging modality. One of them is the lack of noise stationarity, which makes quantitative biomarkers extracted from the images less robust and stable. Some methodologies have been proposed for the assessment of non-stationary noise in reconstructed CT scans. However, those methods focused on the non-stationarity only due to the reconstruction geometry and are mainly based on the propagation of the variance of noise throughout the whole reconstruction process. Additionally, the philosophy followed in the state-of-the-art methods is based on the reduction of noise, but not in the standardization of it. This means that, even if the noise is reduced, the statistics of the signal remain non-stationary, which is insufficient to enable comparisons between different acquisitions with different statistical characteristics. In this work, we propose a statistical characterization of noise in reconstructed CT scans that leads to a versatile statistical model that effectively characterizes different doses, reconstruction kernels, and devices. The statistical model is generalized to deal with the partial volume effect via a localized mixture model that also describes the non-stationarity of noise. Finally, we propose a stabilization scheme to achieve stationary variance. The validation of the proposed methodology was performed with a physical phantom and clinical CT scans acquired with different configurations (kernels, doses, algorithms including iterative reconstruction). The results confirmed its suitability to enable comparisons with different doses, and acquisition protocols.	biological markers;ct scan;calibration;circumscribe (action);entity class - imaging modality;entity name part qualifier - adopted;extraction;iterative reconstruction;iterative method;mixture model;modality (human–computer interaction);normal range;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;protocols documentation;reduction (complexity);sample variance;scanning;software propagation;stationary process;statistical model;algorithm	Gonzalo Vegas-Sánchez-Ferrero;María J.

To simulate the influence to blood vessel induced by tumor growth, cellular automata is employed to simulate the tumor growth, and the tumor geometrical model is meshed to construct the finite element model with tetrahedron cells. At the same time, the vascular geometric model is constructed from a series of pictures and the blood vessels model is distilled from the model with the step of refining the vessels mesh following up to set up the FE thin shell model with triangle units. By collision detection method, contacted points are located and the forces are exerted on the point sets to simulate interaction caused by tumor growth. The experiment shows that the shape and location of tumor and blood vessels change, which conform to real case, and the model can predict the tumor growth status and the influence to tissues around the tumor.	automata theory;cellular automaton;collision detection;finite element method;geometric modeling;simulation	Jian-Hong Gan;Pei-Dong Dai;Qiang Peng;Jim X.

Segmentation of the spinal cord provides measures of atrophy and allows group analysis of multi-parametric MRI via inter-subject registration to a template. All these measures were shown to improve diagnostic and surgical intervention. We developed a framework to automatically segment the spinal cord on T2-weighted MR images, based on the propagation of a deformable model. The algorithm is divided into three parts: first, an initialization step detects the spinal cord position and orientation by using the elliptical Hough transform on multiple adjacent axial slices to produce an initial tubular mesh. Second, a low-resolution deformable model is iteratively propagated along the spinal cord. To deal with highly variable contrast levels between the spinal cord and the cerebrospinal fluid, the deformation is coupled with a contrast adaptation at each iteration. Third, a refinement process and a global deformation are applied on the low-resolution mesh to provide an accurate segmentation of the spinal cord. Our method was evaluated against a semi-automatic edge-based snake method implemented in ITK-SNAP (with heavy manual adjustment) by computing the 3D Dice coefficient, mean and maximum distance errors. Accuracy and robustness were assessed from 8 healthy subjects. Each subject had two volumes: one at the cervical and one at the thoracolumbar region. Results show a precision of 0.30 ± 0.05 mm (mean absolute distance error) in the cervical region and 0.27 ± 0.06 mm in the thoracolumbar region. The 3D Dice coefficient was of 0.93 for both regions. © (2014) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE). Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.

This medical procedure is namely less invasive than an open-surgery as it relies on the deployment of very thin platinum-based wires within the aneurysm through the arteries. When performed intracranially, this procedure must be particularly accurate and therefore carefully planned and performed by experienced radiologists. A simulator of the coil deployment represents an interesting and helpful tool for the physician by providing information on the coil behavior. In this paper, an original modeling is proposed to obtain interactive and accurate simulations of coil deployment. The model takes into account geometric nonlinearities and uses a shape memory formulation to describe its complex geometry. An experimental validation is performed in a contact-free environment to identify the mechanical properties of the coil and to quantitatively compare the simulation with real data. Computational performances are also measured to insure an interactive simulation.	aneurysm;coil device component;computation;deploy;embolization, therapeutic;generic drugs;medical devices;performance;platinum;rem sleep behavior disorder;radiology;simulation;tesla coil;turbulence	Jérémie Dequidt;Maud Marchal;Christian Duriez;Erwan Kerrien;Stephane Cotin	2008	Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ...

a149ccce89af166ef41362c1b0b45e56a5a604a7	the analysis of forces needed for the suturing of elliptical skin wounds		There is a lack of information regarding the forces required for suturing human wounds. The knowledge of suturing forces serves as complementary information for setting up the limiting geometry when using tissue adhesives and it might also be used in robot-assisted surgery. The main purpose of this paper was to evaluate the forces required for suturing selected skin wounds. An elliptical wound was chosen for our study. In this study a numerical analysis and in vivo experiments were performed. Regarding the numerical models, the maximum forces occurred in the middle of the elliptical wound in all cases. In the case of highest pre-stress used in these analyses the maximal force varied from 0.5 N for the smallest wound (30 × 5 mm) to 1.5 N for the largest wound (30 × 15 mm).

In order to systematically evaluate various regularization techniques under controlled conditions, we employed progressively more complex idealized source models (from single dipole to triplet of dipoles) to calculate body surface potentials, which served as an input data to the inverse problem. In total, we examined, 13 different regularization techniques and found that non-quadratic methods (total variation algorithms) and first-order and second-order Tikhonov regularizations outperformed other methodologies.	algorithm;first-order predicate;floor and ceiling functions;matrix regularization;monte carlo method;triplet state;well-posed problem	Matija Milanic;Vojko Jazbinsek;Rok Hren	2014	2014 37th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)	10.1109/MIPRO.2014.6859562	mathematical optimization	DB	51.3320495514165	-80.39269441728578	128926
c4cacbc781dd484a8675e59564e1dbfd4b75da8f	comparative performance evaluation of contrast-detail in full field digital mammography (ffdm) systems using ideal (hotelling) observer versus automated cdmam analysis		The purpose of our work was to evaluate contrast-detail performance for a range of full field digital mammography systems using Hotelling observer SNR analysis and ascertain whether it can be considered an alternative to CDMAM evaluation. Five FFDM systems were evaluated, which differed in generation (age), Automatic Exposure Control (AEC) behaviour, tube/target combination and detector type. Contrast-detail performance was first analysed using CDMAM phantom analysis and then using the Hotelling observer SNR methodology. The Hotelling observer SNR was calculated for input signal ori- ginating from gold discs of varying thicknesses and diameters and then used to estimate the threshold gold thicknesses for each diameter as per CDMAM anal- ysis. There were small differences between the two techniques, especially in small diameter details, which can be attributed to structural characteristics of the CDMAM phantom. The Hotelling observer SNR technique showed lower variability than results from CDMAM analysis. Overall, the Hotelling observer SNR methodology showed variations in the FFDM systems performance con- sistent with previous findings, demonstrating its value as a performance as- sessment metric.	performance evaluation	Ioannis Delakis;Robert Wise;Lauren Morris;Eugenia Kulama	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-07887-8_24	electronic engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	HCI	34.6320149782635	-81.93990659955516	129099

Much of the raw data are comprised of nucleotides and the corresponding quality scores that indicate their reliability. The latter are more difficult to compress and are themselves noisy. Lossless and lossy compression of the quality scores has recently been proposed to alleviate the storage costs, but reducing the noise in the quality scores has remained largely unexplored. This raw data is processed in order to identify variants; these genetic variants are used in important applications, such as medical decision making. Thus improving the performance of the variant calling by reducing the noise contained in the quality scores is important. We propose a denoising scheme that reduces the noise of the quality scores and we demonstrate improved inference with this denoised data. Specifically, we show that replacing the quality scores with those generated by the proposed denoiser results in more accurate variant calling in general. Moreover, a consequence of the denoising is that the entropy of the produced quality scores is smaller, and thus significant compression can be achieved with respect to lossless compression of the original quality scores. We expect our results to provide a baseline for future research in denoising of quality scores.

293323038cd6936c89e508c13544b43ce0dbc979	an axonal model for analysis of ionic concentration alterations induced by high frequency electrical stimulations	sodium;extracellular;axons;electrical stimulation;mathematical model;electric potential;potassium	The nerve conduction blocking by high frequency biphasic (HFB) electrical stimulations has many potentially valuable clinical applications, but its safety margins require further evaluations. This simulation study aimed to construct an axonal model to investigate the effects of HFB electrical currents on the axonal conductibility and ionic concentrations. The axonal model was constructed in the software of NEURON by incorporating the McIntyre-Richardson-Grill model's geometries, Frankenhaeuser-Huxley and passive equations, ionic diffusion mechanism, and sodium pump activities. The applied 5 s HFB electrical stimulation apparently altered the axon's conductibility, which manifested lowered AP amplitudes, elevated resting membrane potentials, and delayed AP initiation times. These changes did not gain complete recoveries within the observed 55 s period, and showed to be mainly attributed to the induced alterations in ionic concentrations of nodal [Na+]i, nodal [K+]i and para-nodal [Na+]o. The results implied that the inter-nodal segments played a buffering role against changes of intracellular nodal ionic concentrations, and the intra-cellular ionic concentrations recovered at the price of increases in para-nodal [Na+]o. This study provided more information useful for evaluating the safety margins of nerve conduction blocking by HFB electrical stimulations, and are valuable for designing more safe and applicable protocols.	ap computer science principles;blocking (computing);functional electrical stimulation;grill (cryptology);huxley: the dystopia;ionic;neuron;richardson number;simulation	Lifei Sun;Sen Li;Changsen Sun;Hailong Liu	2016	2016 9th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing, BioMedical Engineering and Informatics (CISP-BMEI)	10.1109/CISP-BMEI.2016.7852986	extracellular;potassium;mathematical model;sodium;electric potential	SE	24.821222806155465	-84.41039032102366	129635

One possible operation that could benefit from this progress is the Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) reconstruction.  During this operation, the anterior cruciate ligament graft has to be placed in such a way that it is isometric during a flexion-extension  and in traction when the leg is in extension. That is to say two constraints : a geometrical one and a physical one. We present  a CT-Free navigation system that solves both these constraints in real-time and intra-operatively. With the combined solution,  the surgeon will be able to know per-operatively if the graft placement will lead to a robust and effective reconstruction  or not.

To ensure quality control (QC) of FPD system, an easy method for evaluating FPD imaging performance for both stationary and moving objects is required. Until now, simple rotatable QC phantoms have not been available for the easy evaluation of the performance (spatial resolution and dynamic range) of FPD in imaging moving objects. We developed a QC phantom for this purpose. It consists of three thicknesses of copper and a rotatable test pattern of piano wires of various diameters. Initial tests confirmed its stable performance. Our moving phantom is very useful for QC of FPD images of moving objects because it enables visual evaluation of image performance (spatial resolution and dynamic range) easily.	cns disorder;computed tomography scanning systems;detectors;diagnostic radiologic examination;diameter (qualifier value);dynamic range;flat panel detector;imaging phantom;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;physical object;qc-snare proteins;shepp–logan phantom;specimen source codes - quality control;stationary process;test card	Yoshihiro Haga;Koichi Chida;Yohei Inaba;Yuji Kaga;Taiichiro Meguro;Masayuki Zuguchi	2015	Journal of Digital Imaging	10.1007/s10278-015-9816-2	text mining;medical research;computer science;data mining;multimedia	Vision	46.54346784318427	-87.18222914760831	129918

Our method uses randomly distributed unknown points in the imaging volume, either naturally present or induced by randomly sticking beads or other simple markers in the image pace. After these points are segmented, a high dimensional non-linear optimization computes all unknown parameters for calibration, C-arm pose, correspondence and reconstruction. Preliminary phantom experiments indicate an average C-arm tracking accuracy of 0.9 degrees and a 3D reconstruction error of 0.8 mm, with an 80 region of convergence for both the AP and lateral axes. The method appears to be sufficiently accurate for many clinical applications, and appealing since it works without any external instrumentation and does not interfere with the workspace.	3d reconstruction;bead dosage form;calibration;convergence (action);experiment;fiducial marker;instrumentation (attribute);lateral thinking;linear programming;mathematical optimization;mathematics;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;randomness;virtual fixture;workspace	Ameet K.

Real-time reconstruction of internal organs' surfaces is very challenging as the numerous geometric and photometric variabilities and disturbances (bloody parts, specularities, smokes,...) often occur during the surgical operation, sometimes with manipulations by several assistants. We then conceived a structured light vision system to illuminate a coded pattern by means of an external video projector device or miniaturized diffractive optical elements and a laser source. Among the structured light techniques, the spatial neighbourhood scheme is the most relevant class of approaches to deal with moving and deformable surfaces, then to capture the depth map with only one shot. Each neighbourhood (a (3 × 3) window) is representing a codeword of length 9, and is unique in the whole pattern, even if there is a lack of information. To do so, a monochromatic subperfect map-based pattern is computed, driven by a desired minimal Hamming distance, Hmin, between any couple of codewords. This provides patterns with high correction capabilities (Hmin >; 1). For practical considerations, each numerical codeword symbol is associated to a unique visual feature embedding the local orientation of the pattern, which is helpful for the neighbourhood retrieval during the decoding process. Together with the endoscopic device, in vivo real-time reconstructions (in mini-invasive surgical conditions) are presented to assess both the efficiency of the proposed pattern design, the decoding process and the 3-D laparoscope setup realized in the lab.	code word;depth map;embedding;hamming distance;laparoscopes;minimally invasive surgical procedures;monochrome;neighbourhood (graph theory);numerical analysis;organ;photometry;preparation;real-time clock;real-time transcription;smoke;structured light;video projector;video-in video-out	Xavier Maurice;Chadi Albitar;Christophe Doignon;Michel de Mathelin	2012	2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/EMBC.2012.6347305	computer vision;simulation;medicine;engineering;lighting;optics	Vision	42.125495123741864	-86.7058612693739	130229

An accelerated 3D complementary spatial modulation of magnetization (CSPAMM) tagging technique was used to modulate the myocardial tissue and to acquire 3D MR data sets of the whole-heart including three orthog- onal tags within three breath-holds. Each tag set is able to assess the motion along a direction perpendicular to the tag lines. With the application of CSPAMM, the effect of tag fading encountered in SPAMM tagging due to T1 relaxation is mitigated and tag deformations can be visualized for the entire cardiac cycle, including diastolic phases. In the proposed approach, the environment around each voxel in the 3D volume is modeled as a moving sine wavefront with local frequency and amplitude. The biggest advantage of the proposed technique is that the entire framework, from data acquisition to data analysis is in the 3D domain, which permits quantification of both the in-plane and through-plane motion components. The accuracy and the effectiveness of the proposed method has been validated using both simulated and in vivo tag data.	artificial cardiac pacemaker;data acquisition;diastole;license;linear programming relaxation;modulation;myocardium;quantitation;short interspersed nucleotide elements;sinoatrial node;tracer;video-in video-out;voxel	Christian T.

Established techniques to generate HARP sequences provide independent evidence for motion extraction, in the sense that the combined linear system for scalar brightness conservation, applied to the HARP images, can be uniquely solved for a dense field of motion parameters without the need for regularization. In contrast to some of the previously proposed popular methods, no segmentation or tracking of tags over time, nor interpolation of a sparse motion field explicitly coupled to the tag pattern is required, and the problem of tag fading is bypassed. An important novelty is the incorporation of automatic local scale selection so as to obtain a robust solution, which not only yields a stable, but also a smoothly varying motion field of the (healthy) LV myocardial wall. The scheme relies on an integer parameter representing order of approximation, and allows one to simultaneously obtain a dense field of differential tensors capturing the low order differential structure of the motion field, which is useful for the computation of relevant local quantities such as strain rates and material acceleration fields. The methodology is generic and straightforward to implement, and can be generalized to 3D and, in principle, to account for higher order differential structure.	computation;harp;interpolation;linear system;logical volume management;motion field;order of approximation;smoothing;sparse matrix	Luc Florack;Hans C. van Assen;Avan Suinesiaputra	2007	2007 IEEE 11th International Conference on Computer Vision	10.1109/ICCV.2007.4409147	strain rate;computer vision;higher-order logic;magnetization;tensor;feature extraction;computer science;optical flow;mathematics;tracking;linear system	Vision	50.002338093974174	-80.29390530838067	130614

A commercially available eight-well cell culture impedance array (ECIS-8W1E), commonly used in electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS), was used for OVCA429 characterization. Impedances of ECIS-8W1E array were recorded with cell culture medium (without cells) and with OVCA429 cell layer in the culture medium between 100 Hz and 10 MHz frequency. Physiological and interfacial components of experimental impedance data were modeled by equivalent circuit fitting, using a newly developed model. Impedance measurements with cell culture medium show only two semicircles in the admittance plane, which are identified as: 1) low-frequency semicircle due to impedance of gold electrode in contact with the electrolyte and 2) high-frequency semicircle due to impedance of polymer-coated region of the gold electrode in contact with the electrolyte. In the presence of OVCA429 cell layer, three convolved semicircles are observed in the Cole-Cole plane, which are identified as the interfacial impedance in series with the cell layer impedance. The average resistance and capacitance of the OVCA429 cell layer was found to be 152 plusmn 59 Omegamiddotcm2 and 8.5 plusmn 2.4 muF/cm2, respectively.	cell (microprocessor);cell culture techniques;characteristic impedance;convolution;culture media;dielectric spectroscopy;dyskeratosis congenita;electric capacitance;equivalent circuit;european conference on information systems;fifty nine;malignant neoplasm of ovary;megahertz;nominal impedance;polymer;quantitative impedance;refresh rate;series and parallel circuits;solar cell;stage iv ovarian carcinoma;cancer cell;ovarian neoplasm	Abdur Rub Abdur Rahman;Chun-Min Lo;Shekhar Bhansali	2009	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2008.2008488	equivalent circuit;electrical resistance and conductance;electronic engineering;electrical engineering;dielectric spectroscopy;physics;quantum mechanics	Visualization	26.823144960485067	-83.8115190202852	130823

Its imaging features include cortical architectural abnormalities and abnormal structural arrangement at the interface between the grey matter and the white matter.

In this paper, we present yet another interactive modeling of a patientcustomized cortical envelope with which we can automatically re-slice the brain volume in a fashion similar to CMPR.

To facilitate making this distinction and thus aid the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders, we propose a method for developing a spatio-temporal model of morphological differences in the brain due to normal aging. The method utilizes groupwise image registration to characterize morphological variation across brain scans of people with different ages. To extract the deformations that are due to normal aging we use partial least squares regression, which yields modes of deformations highly correlated with age, and corresponding scores for each input subject. Subsequently, we determine a distribution of morphologies as a function of age by fitting smooth percentile curves to these scores. This distribution is used as a reference to which a person's morphology score can be compared. We validate our method on two different datasets, using images from both cognitively normal subjects and patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). Results show that the proposed framework extracts the expected atrophy patterns. Moreover, the morphology scores of cognitively normal subjects are on average lower than the scores of AD subjects, indicating that morphology differences between AD subjects and healthy subjects can be partly explained by accelerated aging. With our methods we are able to assess accelerated brain aging on both population and individual level. A spatio-temporal aging brain model derived from 988 T1-weighted MR brain scans from a large population imaging study (age range 45.9-91.7y, mean age 68.3y) is made publicly available at www.agingbrain.nl.	accelerated aging;alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative;atrophic;image registration;mathematical morphology;neurodegenerative disorders;partial least squares regression;patients;reference model;resonance;visual inspection;percentile	Wyke Huizinga;Dirk H.

Besides the restricted view, a major issue in laparoscopic liver resection is the enhanced visualization of (hidden) vessels, which supply the tumorous liver segment and thus need to be divided prior to the resection. To navigate the surgeon to these vessels, pre-operative abdominal imaging data can hardly be used due to intraoperative organ deformations mainly caused by appliance of carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum and respiratory motion. While regular respiratory motion can be gated and synchronized intra-operatively, motion caused by pneumoperitoneum is individual for every patient and difficult to estimate. Therefore, we propose to use an optically tracked mobile C-arm providing cone-beam CT imaging capability intraoperatively. The C-arm is able to visualize soft tissue by means of its new flat panel detector and is calibrated offline to relate its current position and orientation to the coordinate system of a reconstructed volume. Also the laparoscope is optically tracked and calibrated offline, so both laparoscope and C-arm are registered in the same tracking coordinate system. Intra-operatively, after patient positioning, port placement, and carbon dioxide insufflation, the liver vessels are contrasted and scanned during patient exhalation. Immediately, a three-dimensional volume is reconstructed. Without any further need for patient registration, the volume can be directly augmented on the live laparoscope video, visualizing the contrasted vessels. This augmentation provides the surgeon with advanced visual aid for the localization of veins, arteries, and bile ducts to be divided or sealed.	avc-intra;ct scan;cone beam reconstruction;experiment;flat panel detector;flat panel display;online and offline	Marco Feuerstein;Thomas Mussack;Sandro Michael Heining;Nassir Navab	2007		10.1117/12.706766	radiology;medicine;pathology;surgery	HCI	40.726788706019725	-85.24199766779233	131352

A haptics-based dental simulator (iDental) has been developed and preliminary user evaluation on its first-generation prototype has been carried out to gain the knowledge. Based on detailed requirement analysis of Periodontics procedures, a combined evaluation method including qualitative and quantitative analysis was designed. Construct validity was used to compare the performance difference between two groups of participants (faculty members and dental graduate students). These participants were required to perform three periodontal examination and treatment procedures including periodontal pocket probing, calculus detection, and removal. From the evaluation results, we found that penetration between tool and teeth or cheek will greatly decrease the fidelity of the simulation, therefore, it is necessary to utilize 6-DOF haptic device with both force and torque feedback in dental simulator, and accordingly it is needed to extend point-based rendering to 6-DOF haptic rendering of multiregion contacts. Furthermore, several other key research topics that will enable haptic technology to be effective in a practical dental simulator were identified, including simulation of deformable body such as tongue and gingival, and simulation of occlusion of tongue and cheek on teeth, etc.	calculi;dvd region code;gingiva;haptic technology;odontogenic tissue;performance evaluation;periodontal diseases;periodontic specialty;prototype;requirements analysis;simulation	Dangxiao Wang;Yuru Zhang;Jianxia Hou;Yong Wang;Peijun Lu;Yonggang Chen;Hui Zhao	2012	IEEE Transactions on Haptics	10.1109/TOH.2011.59	requirements analysis;simulation;quantitative analysis;engineering;qualitative research;construct validity;biological engineering;haptic technology;periodontology;tooth	Visualization	38.31780343238823	-89.27134891105703	132286

Recognition of this motion is required for motion compensation by robotic systems. Colour markers allow for robust motion estimation by colour tracking schemes. Anodised blue titanium clips, which can be attached to the heart surface, are proposed as colour markers. Analyses show that their colour distribution is separable from the colour distribution of the heart surface, allowing for robust colour tracking.

Acoustic shadows can be viewed as informative features to detect lesions or calcifications, or can be considered as damageable artifacts for image processing tasks such as segmentation, registration or 3D reconstruction. In both cases, the detection of these acoustic shadows is useful. This paper proposes a new geometrical method to detect these shadows based on statistical analysis of intensity profiles along the lines that compose the B-scan image. The results demonstrate that this detection improves the accuracy of 3D reconstruction of intraoperative ultrasound.	3d reconstruction;acoustic cryptanalysis;acoustic fingerprint;characteristic impedance;image processing;information;raster scan	Pierre Hellier;Pierrick Coupé;Pierre Meyer;Xavier Morandi;D.

b2d8b0c538c049839ed54ae3b73d7d6fc8d8f603	comment on devlin and poldrack		The basic tenet developed by Devlin and Poldrack is to the point: by definition functional neuroimaging is an attempt to map ‘function’ onto ‘anatomy’. Hence it is critical to cast the functional results, albeit indirectly measured, in precise anatomical terms. Furthermore, the authors correctly point out that in many instances insufficient care is devoted to this crucial ‘matching’ step between function and anatomy. The authors make an analysis of the different types of anatomical descriptions presently used for the analysis of human functional imaging data but the conclusions reached in the paper are inherently limited by the choice of ‘reference frame’ or ‘template’ brain upon which functional data are projected. Clearly, the authors reject the use of a brain from a single subject as the ‘template’ (e.g., the Tournoux and Talairach atlas). Moreover, the authors acknowledge that ‘Brodmann areas’ are only one of the possible parcellations of human cortex, just as the Tournoux and Talairach atlas is only a particular reference brain. Indeed, multiple parcellation schemes are possible based on cytoarchitectonics and myeloarchitectonics. Importantly, however, this micro-architecture is in fact only one of four criteria for identifying cortical areas. Monkey studies have clearly shown the limitation of the Brodmann areas and the importance of defining cortical areas by multiple criteria. For example area 18 in the monkey contains several visual retinotopic representations, and these have been definitively recognized as separate cortical areas (V2, V3). It is our position that, just as in the monkey, it is essential in humans to evolve from Brodmann areas to cortical areas defined by multiple criteria: cytoand myeloarchitecture, anatomical connections, the topographic organization (where possible), and functional properties. It may take some time, however, before we have the tools to apply all four criteria to the human brain. In the interim, we agree with the authors and the ICBM that the MNI atlas should be considered as the standard anatomical reference frame, which can be complemented by population-based probabilistic surface maps such as the PALS atlas (Caret software) and automatically labeled T1-weighted images.	anatomic structures;atlases;caret;cervical atlas;description;domain specific term;functional imaging;functional neuroimaging;map;microarchitecture;periarterial lymphatic sheath;projections and predictions;reference frame (video);topography;tracer	Guy A.

Even with the latest hardware and software technologies, achieving both real-time and accurate augmented information overlay in MIS is still a formidable task. In this Letter, the authors present a novel real-time AR framework for MIS that achieves interactive geometric aware AR in endoscopic surgery with stereo views. The authors' framework tracks the movement of the endoscopic camera and simultaneously reconstructs a dense geometric mesh of the MIS scene. The movement of the camera is predicted by minimising the re-projection error to achieve a fast tracking performance, while the three-dimensional mesh is incrementally built by a dense zero mean normalised cross-correlation stereo-matching method to improve the accuracy of the surface reconstruction. The proposed system does not require any prior template or pre-operative scan and can infer the geometric information intra-operatively in real time. With the geometric information available, the proposed AR framework is able to interactively add annotations, localisation of tumours and vessels, and measurement labelling with greater precision and accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.	arabic numeral 0;augmented reality;autoregressive model;bmc remedy action request system;blood vessel;body tissue;clinical use template;computation;computer stereo vision;cross-correlation;endoscope device component;endoscopes;interactivity;matching;minimally invasive surgical procedures;minimally invasive education;movement;musculoskeletal diseases;neoplasms;organ;overlay device component;performance;procedural programming;real-time clock;real-time transcription;real-time web;resource description framework;simultaneous localization and mapping;track (course);virtual reality headset;algorithm;establishment and maintenance of localization;soft tissue	Long Chen;Wen Tang;Nigel W.

In clinical contexts especially, one must consider that visualisations through medical imaging are suggestive in a twofold way. Imaging data not only visually render pathological entities, but also tend to represent objective and concrete evidence for these psychophysical states in question. This article aims to identify key issues in visually rendering psychiatric disorders via functional approaches of imaging within the neurosciences from an epistemological point of view.	entity	Lara Huber	2009	Poiesis & Praxis	10.1007/s10202-008-0055-1	psychology;psychiatry;neuroscience;pathology;functional imaging	Metrics	34.16054395657669	-83.83374981730103	133177
2faeb19985cf98a0cf0e8adc75c92185c084dbad	patch-based discrete registration of clinical brain images		We introduce a method for registration of brain images acquired in clinical settings. The algorithm relies on three-dimensional patches in a discrete registration framework to estimate correspondences. Clinical images present significant challenges for computational analysis. Fast acquisition often results in images with sparse slices, severe artifacts, and variable fields of view. Yet, large clinical datasets hold a wealth of clinically relevant information. Despite significant progress in image registration, most algorithms make strong assumptions about the continuity of image data, failing when presented with clinical images that violate these assumptions. In this paper, we demonstrate a non-rigid registration method for aligning such images. The method explicitly models the sparsely available image information to achieve robust registration. We demonstrate the algorithm on clinical images of stroke patients. The proposed method outperforms state of the art registration algorithms and avoids catastrophic failures often caused by these images. We provide a freely available open source implementation of the algorithm.	accepting of extremity;algorithm;cerebrovascular accident;computation;failure;image registration;morphologic artifacts;muscle rigidity;open-source software;patients;scott continuity;sparse matrix;registration - actclass	Adrian V.

In a first step, the implant geometry is used as a calibration object to relate the implant and the individual X-ray images spatially in a virtual X-ray setup. Second, the patientspecific femoral shape and pose are reconstructed by fitting a deformable statistical shape and intensity model (SSIM) to the X-rays. The relative positioning between femur and implant is then assessed in terms of the displacement between the reconstructed 3D shape of the femur and the plate. We believe that the approach presented in this paper constitutes a meaningful tool to elucidate the effect of implant positioning on fracture healing and, ultimately, to derive load recommendations after surgery.	displacement mapping;radiography;structural similarity	Moritz Ehlke;Mark Heyland;Sven Märdian;Georg N.

For that purpose, we have generated realistic simulated images which mimic the patterns of change obtained from a cohort of 19 real controls and 27 probable Alzheimer's disease patients. SIENA and BSI results correlate very well with gold standard data (BSI mean absolute error < 0.29%; SIENA < 0.44%). Jacobian integration was guided by both fluid and FFD-based registration techniques and resulting deformation fields and associated Jacobians were compared, region by region, with gold standard ones. The FFD registration technique provided more satisfactory results than the fluid one. Mean absolute error differences between volume changes given by the FFD-based technique and the gold standard were: sulcal CSF < 2.49%; lateral ventricles < 2.25%; brain < 0.36%; hippocampi < 1.42%.

Current standard for volumetric measurement of xenografted tumors is by external caliper, a method often affected by error. The aim of the present study was to evaluate if microCT gives more accurate and reproducible measures of tumor size in mice compared with caliper measurements. Furthermore, we evaluated the accuracy of tumor volume determined from 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET.   METHODS Subcutaneously implanted human breast adenocarcinoma cells in NMRI nude mice served as tumor model. Tumor volume (n = 20) was determined in vivo by external caliper, microCT and 18F-FDG-PET and subsequently reference volume was determined ex vivo. Intra-observer reproducibility of the microCT and caliper methods were determined by acquiring 10 repeated volume measurements. Volumes of a group of tumors (n = 10) were determined independently by two observers to assess inter-observer variation.   RESULTS Tumor volume measured by microCT, PET and caliper all correlated with reference volume. No significant bias of microCT measurements compared with the reference was found, whereas both PET and caliper had systematic bias compared to reference volume. Coefficients of variation for intra-observer variation were 7% and 14% for microCT and caliper measurements, respectively. Regression coefficients between observers were 0.97 for microCT and 0.91 for caliper measurements.   CONCLUSION MicroCT was more accurate than both caliper and 18F-FDG-PET for in vivo volumetric measurements of subcutaneous tumors in mice.18F-FDG-PET was considered unsuitable for determination of tumor size. External caliper were inaccurate and encumbered with a significant and size dependent bias. MicroCT was also the most reproducible of the methods.	biomarkers, tumor;caliper;coefficient;fluorodeoxyglucose f18;functional discourse grammar;implants;magnetic resonance imaging;neoplasms;nephroblastoma;pet/ct scan;polyethylene terephthalate;positron-emission tomography;tumor volume;video-in video-out;x-ray microtomography;xenograft procedure;breast adenocarcinoma;observers	Mette Jensen;Jesper T.

f56d46e14b93dac064cf01415e0290fabb05226e	segmentation of liver and spleen based on computational anatomy models	computational anatomy model;organ bounding box;multiple organs segmentation;iterative probabilistic atlas;template matching	Accurate segmentation of abdominal organs is a key step in developing a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system. Probabilistic atlas based on human anatomical structure, used as a priori information in a Bayes framework, has been widely used for organ segmentation. How to register the probabilistic atlas to the patient volume is the main challenge. Additionally, there is the disadvantage that the conventional probabilistic atlas may cause a bias toward the specific patient study because of the single reference. Taking these into consideration, a template matching framework based on an iterative probabilistic atlas for liver and spleen segmentation is presented in this paper. First, a bounding box based on human anatomical localization, which refers to the statistical geometric location of the organ, is detected for the candidate organ. Then, the probabilistic atlas is used as a template to find the organ in this bounding box by using template matching technology. We applied our method to 60 datasets including normal and pathological cases. For the liver, the Dice/Tanimoto volume overlaps were 0.930/0.870, the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) was 2.906mm. For the spleen, quantification led to 0.922 Dice/0.857 Tanimoto overlaps, 1.992mm RMSE. The algorithm is robust in segmenting normal and abnormal spleens and livers, such as the presence of tumors and large morphological changes. Comparing our method with conventional and recently developed atlas-based methods, our results show an improvement in the segmentation accuracy for multi-organs (p<0.00001).

d9dc11fbdc805286f8a85720c1160aa2cdecade4	a cdmam image phantom software improvement for human observer assessment	software tool;roc curve;digital image	A software tool is presented to improve the features of CDMAM image phantom by University Hospital Nijmegen. This software tool ensures that the 4alternative forced choice method of CDMAM is actually kept, even when is being scored by highly expertise observers familiar on the test object pattern. For digital images, the developed software tool automatically changes the image position of the four corners. It can be selected a fixed rotation angle or a random one, so making impossible that any observer is able to remember the exact corner position of the target disc inside any cell. Two alternative successful algorithms have been tested. ROC curve analysis obtained by 36 observers shows that both original and computermodified images are indistinguishable. The ROC area was 0.507±0.024 for first algorithm and 0.522±0.026 for the second one, indicating that there was no statistical difference between real and computer-modified images for both of them.	algorithm;digital image;phantom reference;programming tool;receiver operating characteristic	Gabriel Prieto;Margarita Chevalier;Eduardo Guibelalde	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-70538-3_26	computer vision;simulation;computer science;engineering drawing	Graphics	36.69239566626518	-82.57623609375881	134238

This study was aimed to evaluate the measurement reproducibility of a new software tool for pulmonary nodule volumetry. In an ongoing study, 147 pulmonary nodules (size 1.6-17.5 mm) were examined with low-dose multidetector CT (Siemens Somatom Volume Zoom, 120 kVp, 20 mAs, detector collimation 4x1 mm, normalized pitch 1.75, slice thickness 1.25 mm, reconstruction increment 0.8 mm). Two consecutive low-dose scans covering the whole lung volume were performed within a few minutes. Between both scans, patients were asked to leave the CT scanner, and the second scan was planned independently from the first one. For all visually detected pulmonary nodules with a diameter <20 mm nodule volume was determined on both scans using a software prototype containing segmentation and volumetry algorithms. Results from both scans were compared. Nodule volume differences were determined as difference between the first and second measurement and ranged from 169 to 87%. The performance of the diagnostic test was measured using ROC analysis. For the detection of a volume doubling the area under curve (Az) was 0.98, for a growth of 50% the Az was 0.89. Further refinement of the segmentation algorithm should lead to more consistent measurements in ill-defined nodules. In conclusion, volumetric measurement of pulmonary nodules in multislice CT data sets is a reliable tool for the detection of growth in small pulmonary nodules.© (2002) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

Excessive doses of both X-ray radiation and the contrast agent from continuous fluoroscopy are also critical limitations in clinical practice. To overcome the problem, we propose a surgical navigation system to guide the CTO intervention and delineate technical details to implement the system. The proposed system provides overlay of a 3D computed tomographic angiography (CTA) model onto X-ray images, virtual reality, and multi-planar reconstruction images. We expect the proposed navigation system to potentiate the procedure with reduced operating time, while alleviating the limitations regarding immoderate doses of X-ray radiation and contrast agent by reduced use of fluoroscopy.	ct scan;computed tomography angiography;global positioning system;radiography;virtual reality	Sangseo Jeon;Seok Hwangbo;Jaesung Hong	2016	2016 13th International Conference on Ubiquitous Robots and Ambient Intelligence (URAI)	10.1109/URAI.2016.7734038	navigation;calibration;visualization;computer science;computed tomography	Robotics	39.66629568478804	-85.34041011500429	134420

Previous motion estimation approaches usually depended on 4DCT, which introduced extra radio dose for patients, and the local motion details were ignored in the statistical model. In this paper, we propose a novel estimation framework, which employs the Sparse Motion Field Presentation (SMFP) method to obtain a coarse motion estimation which preserves patient-specific respiratory motion details and an Adaptive Variable Coefficient (AVC) motion prior registration approach is applied for the accurate estimation. The experimental results show that the proposed framework effectively preserved the local motion details and achieved more accurate motion estimations compared to the Mean Motion Model (MMM) and the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) model. We achieved motion estimations for diaphragmatic breathing type, thoracic breathing type and mixed type, respectively. The accuracy measured in the average symmetric surface distance (standard deviation) were 1.9(0.9) mm, 2.4(1.1) mm and 2.2(1.0) mm, when the sum of squared intensity difference (SSD) were 5.0, 6.1 and 5.6, respectively.	avc brand of sulfanilamide;biologic preservation;breech presentation;chest;coefficient;common variable immunodeficiency;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;motion estimation;motion field;myelofibrosis;patients;principal component analysis;solid-state drive;sparse;standard deviation;statistical model;surround sound	Dong Chen;Hongzhi Xie;Shuyang Zhang;Weisheng V Chen;Lixu Gu	2017	2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2017.8036892	computer vision;mean motion;artificial intelligence;square (algebra);diaphragmatic breathing;principal component analysis;motion field;statistical model;standard deviation;motion estimation;mathematics	Vision	45.72652211678767	-81.86259660700541	134453
05cc69e3db3d538ebcbbbabaf3f1549bbdc153d0	cardiac image super-resolution with global correspondence using multi-atlas patchmatch		The accurate measurement of 3D cardiac function is an important task in the analysis of cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) images. However, short-axis image acquisitions with thick slices are commonly used in clinical practice due to constraints of acquisition time, signal-to-noise ratio and patient compliance. In this situation, the estimation of a high-resolution image can provide an approximation of the underlaying 3D measurements. In this paper, we develop a novel algorithm for the estimation of high-resolution cardiac MR images from single short-axis cardiac MR image stacks. First, we propose to use a novel approximate global search approach to find patch correspondence between the short-axis MR image and a set of atlases. Then, we propose an innovative super-resolution model which does not require explicit motion estimation. Finally, we build an expectation-maximization framework to optimize the model. We validate the proposed approach using images from 19 subjects with 200 atlases and show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms conventional interpolation such as linear or B-spline interpolation. In addition, we show that the super-resolved images can be used for the reproducible estimation of 3D cardiac functional indices.	anp32a gene;apache axis;approximation algorithm;atlases;axis vertebra;b-spline;basal (phylogenetics);body dysmorphic disorders;compliance behavior;expectation–maximization algorithm;extrapolation;image resolution;interpolation imputation technique;lr parser;motion estimation;optic axis of a crystal;patchmatch;resonance;self-similarity;signal-to-noise ratio;spline interpolation;sulfanilamide;super-resolution imaging;time complexity	Wenzhe Shi;Jose Caballero;Christian Ledig;Xiahai Zhuang;Wenjia Bai;Kanwal K.

The method is based on volume visualization of standard computed tomography datasets and augmented reality for interactive visualization of the generated volume. It supports our liver surgery planner method in the analysis of the segmented liver and in the color classification of the vessels.

The sequences can be analyzed to form 3D models of the geometry and further including functional information of the neurons of the specific brain area to develop functional models. Modeling offers a tool which can be used for the modeling of brain trauma from images of the patients and thus information to tailor the properties of the transplanted cells. In this paper, we present image-based methods for the analysis of human spinal cord injuries. In this effort, we use three dimensional diffusion tensor imaging, which is an effective method for analyzing the response of the water molecules. This way, our idea is to study how the injury affects on the tissues and how this can be made visible in the imaging. In this paper, we present here a study of spinal cord analysis to two subjects, one healthy volunteer and one spinal cord injury patient. We have done segmentations and volumetric analysis for detection of anatomical differences. The functional differences are analyzed by using diffusion tensor imaging. The obtained results show that this kind of analysis is capable of finding differences in spinal cords anatomy and function.	3d modeling;effective method;medical imaging;resonance	Markus Hannula;Adeola Olubamiji;Iivari Kunttu;Prasun Dastidar;Seppo Soimakallio;Juha Öhman;Jari Hyttinen	2011		10.1117/12.872306	diffusion mri;three-dimensional space;water;systems modeling;molecule;quantitative analysis;function model;magnetic resonance imaging;diffusion;physics	Vision	35.78850931730749	-85.55784284985147	134649

We propose to noninvasively map local rod rhodopsin density throughanalysis of the brightening of the underlying lipofuscin autouorescence (LAF) in confocal scanning laser ophthal-moscopy (cSLO) imaging sequences starting in the dark adapted eye. The detected LAF increases as rhodopsin isbleached (time constant 25 sec ) by the average retinal irradiance of the cSLO 488nm laser beam. We t param-eters of analytical expressions for the kinetics of rhodopsin bleaching that Lamb validated using electroretinogramrecordings in human. By performing localized ( 100 µm ) kinetic analysis, we create high resolution maps of therhodopsin density. This new noninvasive imaging and analysis approach appears well-suited for measuring local-ized changes in the rod photoreceptors and correlating them at high spatial resolution with localized pathologicalchanges of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) seen in steady-state LAF images.Keywords: rhodopsin bleaching, rod density, retinal lesions, confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope	kinetics internet protocol	Martin Ehler;Julia A.

An objective function is first set up for the MRI reconstruction problem with a data fidelity term and a Bayesian term. The Bayesian term is a constraint in the temporal dimension. This objective function is minimized using the calculus of variations. The proposed algorithm is non-iterative. Undersampled dynamic myocardial perfusion MRI data were used to test the feasibility of the proposed technique. It is shown that the non-iterative Fourier reconstruction method effectively incorporates the temporal constraint and significantly reduces the angular aliasing artifacts caused by undersampling. A significant advantage of the proposed non-iterative Fourier technique over the iterative techniques is its fast computation time.	algorithm;aliasing;angularjs;calculi;calculus of variations;computation;computation (action);data acquisition;dynamic data;experiment;fill out form;filtered backprojection;flow-based programming;frame (physical object);hoc (programming language);iteration;iterative method;iterative reconstruction;loss function;microscopy, energy-filtering transmission electron;morphologic artifacts;optimization problem;population parameter;preparation;ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability;radial (radio);reconstruction conjecture;sampling - surgical action;summation (function);time complexity;undersampling	Gengsheng Lawrence Zeng;Ya Feng Li;Edward V.

We analyse three functional imaging techniques that can be useful tools for achieving this objective.   MATERIALS AND METHODS The three different imaging modalities from one selected patient are ADC maps, DCE-MRI, and 18F-FDG PET/CT, because they are widely used and give a great amount of complementary information. We show the relationship between these three datasets and evaluate them as markers for tumour response or hypoxia marker. Thus, vascularization measured using DCE-MRI parameters can determine tumour hypoxia, and ADC maps can be used for evaluating tumour response.   RESULTS ADC and DCE-MRI include information from 18F-FDG, as glucose metabolism is associated with hypoxia and tumour cell density, although 18F-FDG includes more information about the malignancy of the tumour. The main disadvantage of ADC maps is the distortion, and we used only low distorted regions, and extracellular volume calculated from DCE-MRI can be considered equivalent to ADC in well-vascularized areas.   CONCLUSION A dataset for achieving the biologically guided radiotherapy must include a tumour density study and a hypoxia marker. This information can be achieved using only MRI data or only PET/CT studies or mixing both datasets.	alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive cdisc version questionnaire;diffusion magnetic resonance imaging;distortion;fluorodeoxyglucose f18;functional imaging;functional discourse grammar;gradient;hypoxia;imaging techniques;map;multimodal imaging;neoplasms;pathologic neovascularization;patients;personalization;pet therapy;plant extracts;polyethylene terephthalate;silo (dataset);voxel;glucose metabolism;interest;standards characteristics	Moises Mera-Iglesias;David Aramburu-Nunez;José Luis del Olmo Claudio;Antonio Lopez-Medina;Iago Landesa-Vazquez;Francisco Salvador Gómez;Brandon Driscoll;Catherine Coolens;José Luis Alba-Castro;Victor Munoz-Garzon	2015		10.1155/2015/103843	integral;radiology;medicine;magnetic resonance imaging;nuclear medicine;medical physics	ML	34.90998415921288	-84.04834839012621	135474

Experiments on animal and human donor eyes, as well as synthetic radiofrequency (RF) data, were used to evaluate the efficacy of the OPE method. Using very high-frequency ultrasound (center frequency = 55 MHz), correlation-based speckle tracking yielded an accuracy of less than 10% error for axial tissue displacements of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$0.5~\mu \text{m}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> or above.

Experiments in human donor eyes showed excellent repeatability with an intraclass correlation of 0.98. The measurement outcome from OPE was also shown to be highly correlated with that of standard inflation.

ABSTRACT Image registration is a very important procedure in medical imaging analysis. However, the intensive computations involved in image registration have to some extent made it impractical for interactive use as well as limiting its general availability. This paper presents our current Grid project to facilitate image registration tasks. We have set up an image registration Grid by combining the attractive features of both Globus and Condor distributed computing environments. In order to make it more convenient to use, we have also developed a web interface for potential clients to specify and submit their image registration jobs to the Grid. The initial experiments in 3D breast MR images have shown encouraging results and demonstrated the suitability of Grid technology to this type of computationally intensive applications. The image registration Grid makes it much more straightforward for different institutes to use the identical registration program and protocols to register images consistently, quickly and efficiently. This can greatly improve data sharing and comparative studies in multi-centre trials. The Grid presented here could be an important step for clinical applications of image registration. Future work will focus on refining the Grid with the aim of upgrading it to a Grid Service and testing the system more extensively with medical imaging dataset. Keywords: Image Registration, Medical Image Analysis, Grid, Globus, Condor, Distributed Computing, OGSA, Grid Service. 2. Introduction Image registration is an important procedure in medical imaging analysis. The purpose of image registration is to align one image (source image) to another (target or reference image) so that the possible misalignments between them can be minimized or eliminated, thus establishing spatial correspondence. Proper registration enables us to have a better understanding of the features of interest and integration of useful information. Applications are wide: ranging from image-guided surgery to atlas construction, segmentation propagation, monitoring changes over time and dynamic sequence analysis. The general procedure of fully automated image registration typically requires optimization of a function of the similarity between the target and source images. A large variety of image registration methods have been proposed for medical applications. In practice, image registration can be further classified as rigid and non-rigid according to the underlying transformation model. The former registers images by assuming that images are misaligned by translations and rotations only while the latter allows many more degrees of freedom. Compared to rigid registration, non-rigid registration can theoretically model more complicated deformations but requires more computation [1, 2]. Rigid registration is normally used to provide a starting estimate before non-rigid registration in order to reduce computational time. Even so non-rigid registration still requires massive computational time, e.g. an average computation time up to 5 hours has been reported to register 3-D MR images of a single breast with a typical region of	contrast ratio	Yalin Zheng;Christine Tanner;Derek L.

f8c3ccdaa98b0f9b281fca8b25c649d0cc0b8638	design of patient-specific concentric tube robots using path planning from 3-d ultrasound		Percutaneous techniques and robot-assisted surgical systems have enabled minimally invasive procedures that offer reduced scarring, recovery time, and complications compared to traditional open surgeries. Despite these improvements, access to diseased sites using the standard, straight needle-based percutaneous techniques is still limited for certain procedures due to intervening tissues. These limitations can be further exacerbated in specific patient groups, particularly pediatric patients, whose anatomy does not fit the traditional tools and systems. We therefore propose a patient-specific paradigm to design and fabricate dexterous, robotic tools based on the patient's preoperative images. In this paper, we present the main steps of our proposed paradigm - image-based path planning, robot design, and fabrication - along with an example case that focuses on a class of dexterous, snake-like tools called concentric tube robots. We demonstrate planning a safe path using a patient's preoperative ultrasound images. We then determine the concentric tube robot parameters needed to achieve this path, and finally, we use 3-D printing to fabricate the patient-specific robot.	3d printing;anatomic structures;body tissue;kidney calculi;motion planning;operative surgical procedures;patients;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;printing, three-dimensional;programming paradigm;robot (device);specimen source codes - tube	Tania K.

It allows the planning of punctures or trocars insertion trajectories, taking anatomical constraints into account. Geometrical transformations allow the projection over the patient's body of the organs and lesions shapes, realistically reconstructed, using a standard video projector in the operating room. We developed specific image processing software which automatically segments and registers images of a webcam used in the operating room to give feedback to the user.© (2010) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

One challenge of image analysis is following the vesicle's fate continuously from its formation at the membrane to its final destination, as it requires different microscopy techniques to image the complete journey. Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy is used for imaging events at the cell membrane and laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) is used for imaging the interior of the cell. We present a simple and robust method for co-registration of data sets from the two microscopy techniques. This method is validated on images generated by computer simulation of the image formation process in TIRF and in LSCM. The registration parameters are recovered with error less than 1% in presence of Gaussian noise up to SNR of 3.8dB. Registration of real microscopy data is shown and the accuracy of the retrieved parameters is compared and agrees well with values obtained manually and a difference in squares measure.	computer simulation;image analysis;image formation;least squares conformal map;signal-to-noise ratio	William T.

18915041ac04e58ed93e1cc073521d0557b1debf	enhanced intraoperative visualization for brain surgery: a prototypic simulated scenario		Due to the required high precision and reliability, image guidance is increasingly being adapted in neurosurgery, where correspondences between the patient and scanned data are viewed on multiple displays. In this paper, we present a prototype for an augmented reality system that provides enhanced intraoperative visualization within the optical surgery microscope image. For this purpose, relevant targeted and risk structures are extracted from registered patient data and overlaid on the real scene. Similarly, supportive information of underlying anatomy can be superimposed, which includes, amongst others, shape and depth information of tumors, and interactively selected tomographical slices. The overall advantage is a more ergonomic hand-eye coordination, a more accurate delineation of targeted structures and better protection of risk anatomy.	augmented reality;computational anatomy;human factors and ergonomics;interactivity;prototype;tomography	Zein Salah;Bernhard Preim;Amir Samii;Rudolf Fahlbusch;Georg Rose	2010			computer vision;simulation;computer science;biological engineering	Visualization	39.8866397368424	-85.62378973629323	136191
ca6115962b1614eca1d6907fc5baaadc9f58c1e3	feasibility of eye-tracking based glasses-free 3d autostereoscopic display systems for medical 3d images		Medical image diagnosis processes with stereoscopic depth by 3D display have not been developed widely yet and remain understudied Many stereoscopic displays require glasses that are inappropriate for use in clinical diagnosis/explanation/operating processes in hospitals. An eye-tracking based glasses-free threedimensional autostereoscopic display monitor system has been developed, and its feasibility for medical 3D images was investigated, as a cardiac CT 3D navigator. Our autostereoscopic system uses slit-barrier with BLU, and it is combined with our vision-based eye tracking system to display 3D images. Dynamic light field rendering technique is applied with the 3D coordinates calculated by the eye-tracker, in order to provide a single viewer the best 3D images with less x-talk. To investigate the feasibility of our autostereoscopic system, 3D volume was rendered from 3D coronary CTA images (512 by 512 by 400). One expert reader identified the three main artery structures (LAD, LCX and RCA) in shorter time than existing 2D display. The reader did not report any eye fatigue or discomfort. In conclusion, we proposed a 3D cardiac CT navigator system with a new glasses-free 3D autostereoscopy, which may improve diagnosis accuracy and fasten diagnosis	autostereoscopy;ct scan;computed tomography of the heart;computer monitor;eye tracking;least absolute deviations;light field;radiology;stereo display;stereoscopy;tracking system	Dongwoo Kang;Seok Lee;Hyoseok Hwang;Juyong Park;Jingu Heo;Byongmin Kang;Jin-Ho Lee;Yoonsun Choi;Kyuhwan Choi;Dongkyung Nam	2016		10.5220/0005826901340138	rendering (computer graphics);artificial intelligence;computer science;autostereoscopy;computer vision;eye fatigue;computer graphics (images);stereoscopy;stereo display;eye tracking	Graphics	39.678329162433855	-86.32562139820705	136226

The proposed model takes 3D mesh of the blood vessel as input. It first fits a generalized cylinder to extract the blood vessel's medial axis. Then, it uses rotation minimizing frame as a reference to model and measure the torsion of blood vessel after deformation. In general, the proposed approach can incorporate any kind of deformation algorithms. In our experiments, differential geometry method is used as an example. The test results show that our algorithm can correctly and effectively evaluate the amount of torsion caused by blood vessel deformation. In addition, it can also determine the configuration of the blood vessel with minimum torsion.	algorithm;apache axis;automated planning and scheduling;axis vertebra;blood vessel;cylinder seal;experiment;fits;medial graph;simulation;torsion (gastropod)	Hao Li;Wee Kheng Leow;Ing-Sh Chiu	2009	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-58603-964-6-153	deformation (mechanics);control theory;data mining;medial axis;polygon mesh;cylinder;differential geometry;blood vessel;torsion (mechanics);surgery;medicine	Robotics	39.52964095249592	-83.04374437117175	136440
c818e5a911b93bc518b0bfbd5de28bb470c83421	electromagnetic tissue properties imaging for biomedical applications	electromagnetic phenomena;diagnostic imaging;algorithms;humans	Recently, imaging techniques in science, engineering, and medicine have evolved to expand our ability to visualize a property of an object such as the human body. In particular, there has been marked progress in electromagnetic property imaging techniques, where cross sectional image reconstructions of electric conductivity, permittivity, and magnetic susceptibility distributions inside the human body are pursued. These techniques also have wider application to imaging methods in medicine, biotechnology, nondestructive testing, monitoring of industrial process, and others. This special issue focuses on imaging methodologies, mathematical models, and computational algorithms for imaging electrical tissue properties for biomedical applications. The imaging problems in this topic can be formulated as inverse problems that are intrinsically nonlinear. Finding solutions with practical significance and value requires indepth understanding of the underlying physical phenomena anddata acquisition systems aswell as implementation details of image reconstruction algorithms. Experience over the last three decades has shown that the symbiotic interplay between theoretical mathematics, computational mathematics, and experiments is crucial for understanding and solving these nonlinear problems in practice. With this special issue, we hope to give an opportunity for this scientific community to consolidate knowledge in the field and to identify the new challenges and the most promising directions for future progress.	algorithm;body tissue;computational mathematics;electric conductivity;experiment;imaging techniques;iterative reconstruction;mathematical model;nonlinear system;physical phenomena	Jin Keun Seo;William Lionheart;Ulrich Katscher;Eung Je Woo	2013		10.1155/2013/461846	psychology;medical imaging;biology;simulation;radiology;medicine;pathology;computer science;nanotechnology;mathematics;physics;algorithm	ML	44.044676665336965	-87.36063024242438	136485

These results represent the first step towards obtaining a more accurate understanding of wave propagation properties through striated muscles. Using a 3-D computational grid of 32*32*128 cells, a single muscle bundle was modeled. The individual fibers and inter-fiber matter making up the bundle were treated homogeneously. Using a modified FitzHugh-Nagumo equation called the Epsilon-4 model, the authors obtained the relationship of propagation speed as a function of cross-sectional depth. The variations in speed that were observed can be explained in terms of the different wave curvatures arising from different types of boundary conditions and the geometry of the pathway. From these observations, the authors construct experiments where unidirectional blocks can occur in geometries with low excitability and no flux borders. >	software propagation;strand (programming language)	Naim Alper;Alex T.

The sensitivity of the excitation and blocking thresholds of the nerve fibres to various geometric and stimulation parameters was examined. The nerve fibres had a spiral shape (defined by the undulation wavelength, undulation amplitude and phase), and the internodal length varied. Diameter-selective stimulation of nerve fibres was obtained using anodal block. Simulation was performed using a two-part simulation model: a volume conductor model to calculate the electrical potential distribution inside a tripolar cuff electrode and a model of a peripheral undulating human nerve fibre to simulate the fibre response to stimulation. The excitation threshold of the undulating fibres was up to 100% higher than the excitation threshold of the straight fibres. When a nerve was stimulated with long pulses, which are typically applied for anodal block (>400μs), the blocking threshold of the undulating fibres was up to four times higher than the blocking threshold of the straight fibres. Dependencies of the excitation threshold on geometric and stimulation parameters were the same as for a straight fibre. Dependencies of the blocking threshold on geometric and stimulation parameters were different compared with a straight fibre. Owing to the fibre undulation and variable internodal length, the blocking threshold and the minimum pulse duration to obtain anodal block were generally different in the proximal and distal directions. Owing to variable fibre geometry, the excitation threshold varied by up to ±40% of the mean value, and the blocking threshold varied by up to ±60% of the mean value. Owing to undulation, the blocking threshold of large fibres could be higher than the blocking threshold of small-diameter fibres, even if they had the same geometry. The results indicate that, during skeletal muscle stretching and contracting or during variation in joint angle, the excitation and blocking thresholds of the nerve fibres change owing to variations in fibre geometry. A straight fibre model could be too simple for modelling the response of peripheral nerve fibres to electrical stimulation.	blocking (computing);contract agreement;diameter (protocol);diameter (qualifier value);electric stimulation technique;excitation;functional electrical stimulation;nerve fibers;peripheral nerves;pulse duration;simulation;skeletal muscle structure;undulation of the geoid;wavelength	Aleksandra Vuckovic;Johannes J.

We extend our visualization method presented earlier, to achieves this goal by fusing a direct (photographic) view of the surgical field with the 3D patient model. To correlate the preoperative plan with the intraoperative surgical scene, an intensity-based perspective 3D-2D registration was employed for camera pose estimation. The 2D photographic image was then texture-mapped onto the 3D preoperative model using the solved camera pose. In the proposed method, we employ direct volume rendering to obtain a perspective view of the brain image using GPU-accelerated ray-casting. This is advantageous compared to the point-based or other feature-based registration since no intermediate processing is required. To validate our registration algorithm, we used a point-based 3D-2D registration, that was validated using ground truth from simulated data, and then the intensity-based 3D-2D registration method was validated using the point-based registration result as the gold standard. The registration error of the intensity-based 3D- 2D method was around 3mm when the initial pose is close to the gold standard. Application of the proposed method for correlating fMRI maps with intraoperative cortical stimulation is shown for surgical planning in an epilepsy patient.© (2009) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

As the use of splints is a well established technique for this purpose and any change in its geometry directly influences the accuracy of the navigation, a regular monitoring of such deformations should occur as a means of quality control. This work presents a method to quantify such deformations based on computed tomography images of a splint equipped with fiducial markers. Point-to-point registration is used to match the two data sets and some markers near to the navigation field are used to estimate the registration error. The Hausdorff Distance, describing the maximum of all minimal distances between two point sets in general, is applied to the surfaces of the models, being a measure for the overall change in geometry. Finally this method for quantification is demonstrated using a computed tomography data set of such a splint together with an artificially modified one, being an initial step to a study examining the influence of the Sterrad sterilisation system on acrylic splints.	ct scan;fibre channel point-to-point;fiducial marker;hausdorff dimension;splint;tomography	Christoph Weber;Michael Figl;Kurt Schicho	2010		10.1117/12.844373	hausdorff distance;computer vision;quality control;robotic surgery;point-to-point;coordinate system;accuracy and precision;computed tomography;hausdorff space;sterilization	Vision	40.52154624582185	-82.6138857233151	137122

Traditionally, determining the segments requires segmentation and identification of segmental bronchi, which, in turn, require volumetric imaging data. In this paper, we present a method for approximating the bronchopulmonary segments for sparse data by effectively using an anatomical atlas. The atlas is constructed from a volumetric data and contains accurate information about bronchopulmonary segments. A new ray-tracing based image registration is developed for transferring the information from the atlas to a query image. Results show that the method is able to approximate the segments using sparse HRCT data with slice gap up to 25 millimeters.	approximation algorithm;high-resolution computed tomography;image registration;ray tracing (graphics);sparse matrix	Sata Busayarat;Tatjana Zrimec	2007		10.1117/12.709651	computer vision;pathology;computer science;engineering drawing	Robotics	42.03312910157287	-80.46551570862742	137404

3987bc10c7067ab615e5161eb3e37a20facd3a6c	bio-inspired methods modeled for respiratory disease detection from medical images		Medicine is an important venue for practical applications of science. A fusion of mathematical modeling and programming into computer methods makes a great support for efficient treatment and diagnosis. Computational Intelligence is one of these sciences which bring valuable help in decision support. In this article we present a devoted methodology implemented to simulate medical examinations of pulmonary diseases. We propose Bio-Inspired Methods modeled to work as the automated decision support in a process of diseased tissues detection over input x-ray images. These methods have special features that with devoted modeling make them independently search over the images with a good accuracy. In our approach we use dedicated fitness condition for selected heuristic algorithms. Mathematical model of medical expertise is formulated as a function used to search for special features of pixels that are representing respiratory diseases like pneumonia, lungs sarcoidosis and cancer. Presented decision modeling simulates medical x-ray image examination process to show where potentially diseased tissues are located. To enhance decision support the system returns to the doctor detection results from two tracks. In the first, patient and doctor can see detection from each of the algorithms, and in the second aggregated results. In this way the doctor receives a complex support that simulates consulting the image with various specialists. In benchmark tests, for a set of original x-ray images from various clinics, applied methods were examined to demonstrate benefits of using implemented solution. Results show that proposed methodology is efficient and promising for pulmonary diseases detection.

3d9490c66dbb3e8459686e6cb1acb9094eb2f448	computer simulation of three-dimensional plaque formation and progression in the carotid artery	computer model	Atherosclerosis is becoming the number one cause of death worldwide. In this study, three-dimensional computer model of plaque formation and development for human carotid artery is developed. The three-dimensional blood flow is described by the Navier–Stokes equation, together with the continuity equation. Mass transfer within the blood lumen and through the arterial wall is coupled with the blood flow and is modeled by a convection–diffusion equation. The low-density lipoproteins transports in lumen of the vessel and through the vessel tissue are coupled by Kedem–Katchalsky equations. The inflammatory process is modeled using three additional reaction–diffusion partial differential equations. Fluid–structure interaction is used to estimate effective wall stress analysis. Plaque growth functions for volume progression are correlated with shear stress and effective wall stress distribution. We choose two specific patients from MRI study with significant plaque progression. Plaque volume progression using three time points for baseline, 3- and 12-month follow up is fitted. Our results for plaque localization correspond to low shear stress zone and we fitted parameters from our model using nonlinear least-square method. Determination of plaque location and composition, and computer simulation of progression in time for a specific patient shows a potential benefit for the prediction of disease progression. The proof of validity of three-dimensional computer modeling in the evaluation of atherosclerotic plaque burden may shift the clinical information of MRI from morphological assessment toward a functional tool. Understanding and prediction of the evolution of atherosclerotic plaques either into vulnerable or stable plaques are major tasks for the medical community.	atherosclerosis;baseline (configuration management);blood vessel tissue;carotid arteries;cessation of life;color gradient;computer simulation;convection;dental plaque;low-density lipoproteins;mobility aid;navier–stokes equations;nonlinear system;patients;progressive disease;scott continuity;seizures;senile plaques;stress–strain analysis;structure of lumen of body system;shear stress	Nenad Filipovic;Zhongzhao Teng;Milos D.

Diffusion tensor imaging offers the possibility to describe non invasively the fascicles spatial organization at an early stage and to follow the cerebral maturation with quantitative parameters that might be correlated with behavioral development. Here, we assessed the feasibility to study the organization and maturation of major white matter bundles in eighteen 1- to 4-month-old healthy infants, using a specific acquisition protocol customized to the immature brain (with 15 orientations of the diffusion gradients and a 700 s mm(-2)b factor). We were able to track most of the main fascicles described at later ages despite the low anisotropy of the infant white matter, using the FACT algorithm. This mapping allows us to propose a new method of quantification based on reconstructed tracts, split between specific regions, which should be more sensitive to specific changes in a bundle than the conventional approach, based on regions-of-interest. We observed variations in fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity over the considered developmental period in most bundles (corpus callosum, cerebellar peduncles, cortico-spinal tract, spino-thalamic tract, capsules, radiations, longitudinal and uncinate fascicles, cingulum). The results are in good agreement with the known stages of white matter maturation and myelination, and the proposed approach might provide important insights on brain development.	acquisition protocol;anatomical maturation;biologic development;body of uterus;cerebellar peduncle;cerebral white matter structure;cerebrovascular accident;corpus callosum;customize;diffusion tensor imaging;eighteen;fascicle - nerve fibers;fractional anisotropy;functional tests domain;gradient;infant, newborn;limited stage (cancer stage);quantitation;radiation;spatial organization;thalamic structure;tissue fiber;tract (literature);algorithm;brain development;capsule (pharmacologic);dinoflagellate cingulum;myelination	Jessica Dubois;Lucie Hertz-Pannier;Ghislaine Dehaene-Lambertz;Yann Cointepas;Denis Le Bihan	2006	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.11.022	psychology;diffusion mri;neural development;feasibility study;neuroscience;developmental psychology;radiology;medicine;tractography;spatial organization;fractional anisotropy;anatomy;region of interest	Vision	41.62951751313775	-80.35051451391749	137653

The MR defecography assists in the diagnosis of pelvic floor weakening, fecal incontinence, painful defection and genital prolapse. To identify an abnormal morphological variation of the structures relevant for the diagnosis, the radiologist derives several static measures at different moments and at different maneuvers during the exam. However, there is a poor agreement between independent observers for the measurement of the anorectal angle, which is a critical parameter for the interpretation of the defecography. With the aim of reducing the inter-observer variability and assisting the radiologist in the interpretation of the MR defecography for the diagnosis of fecal incontinence, we propose calculating dynamic changes of anorectal junction during the defecation activity. To that end we propose to propagate, automatically, the location of pre-defined landmarks throughout the frames of the MR defecography, for each maneuver, via image registration based on variational model. The analysis of the results shows that our proposal was well succeeded in the propagation of the initial landmarks and to calculate the dynamic changes during each maneuver.	image registration;inter-rater reliability;mathematical morphology;radiology;software propagation;spatial variability;variational principle	Cicero L.

In this paper, we present a real-time 3D reconstruction system for interventional environments which aims at predicting collisions by building a 3D representation of all the objects in the room. The 3D reconstruction is used to determine whether other objects are in the working volume of the device and to alert the medical staff before a collision occurs. In the case of C-arms, this allows faster rotational and angular movement which could for instance be used in 3D angiography to obtain a better reconstruction of contrasted vessels. The system also prevents staff to unknowingly enter the working volume of a device. This is of relevance in complex environments with many devices. The recovered 3D representation also opens the path to many new applications utilizing this data such as workflow analysis, 3D video generation or interventional room planning. To validate our claims, we performed several experiments with a real C-arm that show the validity of the approach. This system is currently being transferred to an interventional room in our university hospital.	3d reconstruction;alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma;angularjs;blood vessel;coat of arms;experiment;hospitals, university;how true feel alert right now;interventional study;medical robot;physical object;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time operating system;real-time transcription;relevance;robot (device);wild arms;angiogram;collision	Alexander Ladikos;Selim Benhimane;Nassir Navab	2008	Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ...

The device is dedicated to trans-rectal stimulation of the pudendal nerve which is triggered by the external sphincter EMG signal. In an effort to identify the optimum stimulation parameters, a family of strength-duration curves with varying pulse repetition frequencies was generated. The electrode-tissue interface was modeled as an RC circuit and a heuristic method for estimating the model parameters was used. A 2D model of the electric field around the probe was also constructed, using finite element methods, to investigate further possibilities for optimization.	electromyography;finite element method;heuristic;mathematical optimization;neuromodulation (medicine);rc circuit;source-to-source compiler;wearable computer;wearable technology	Arsam N.

It has been long used solely with post-hoc analysis, but the recent efforts began to include closed-loop experiments. Closed-loop experiments pose new challenges because they require fast, real-time image processing without iterative parameter tuning. When imaging awake animals, one of the crucial steps of post hoc image analysis is correction of lateral motion artifacts. In most of the closed-loop experiments, this step has not been implemented and ignored due to technical difficulties. We recently reported the first experiments with real-time processing of calcium imaging that included lateral motion correction. Here, we report the details of the implementation of fast motion correction and present performance analysis across several algorithms with different parameters. Additionally, we introduce a novel method to estimate baseline calcium signal using kernel density estimate, which reduces the number of parameters to be tuned. Combined, we propose a novel software pipeline of real-time image processing suited for closed-loop experiments. The pipeline is also useful for rapid post hoc image processing.

9ad04733b8f9e40498c083e4a6202cdc11eedeaa	joint image extraction algorithm and super-resolution algorithm for rheumatoid arthritis medical examinations		Super-resolution techniques have been widely used in fields such as television, aerospace imaging, and medical imaging. In medical imaging, X-rays commonly have low resolution and a significant amount of noise, because radiation levels are minimized to maintain patient safety. So, we proposed a novel super-resolution method for X-ray images, and a novel measurement algorithm for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using X-ray images generated by our proposed super-resolution method. However, in our proposed system, there are several operations to do by doctors manually, and it is hard for them. By utilizing image recognition technology, it is possible to extract joint images from X-ray images automatically. In this paper, we will discuss an algorithm to extract joint images from X-ray images automatically. Experimental results show that correct joint images will be obtained for our proposed method. Therefore, our proposed measurement algorithm is effective for RA medical examinations.

First, we present simulation results that show laser irradiation to the elastic medium creates inner elastic waves on the basis of thermoelastic effects and these elastic waves trigger the bending deformation of the medium, which then stimulates the skin. Second, we analyze the physical properties of the associated stimulus by measuring its force profile. Third, we identify the perceptual characteristics of the stimulus in comparison to those of mechanical and electrical stimuli by means of a perceptual experiment employing dissimilarity rating. All the evidence indicates that indirect laser radiation provides a sensation of short mechanical tap. Furthermore, little individual difference was observed in the results of the perceptual experiment. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first in reporting the feasibility of indirect laser radiation for mid-air tactile rendering.	computer simulation;decompression sickness;fingertip dosing unit;heart rate variability;lasers;optimal design;physical phenomenon or property;precipitating factors;touch sensation	Hojin Lee;Ji-Sun Kim;Jae-Young Kim;Seungmoon Choi;Jae-Hoon Jun;Jong-Rak Park;A.-Hee Kim;Han-Byeol Oh;Jun-Hyeok Baek;Seung-Jin Yang;Hyung-Sik Kim;Soon-Cheol Chung	2016	IEEE Transactions on Haptics	10.1109/TOH.2016.2569081	acoustics;laser;sensory stimulation therapy;optoelectronics;skin;optics;physics	Robotics	26.3318800014449	-83.50251567743969	138867
f30ddcc6218dc175284c2b654b4f2ab2dc49cf64	multiplane spectroscopic whole-body photoacoustic imaging of small animals in vivo		We have successfully developed a multiscale acoustic-resolution photoacoustic tomography system in a single imaging platform. By switching between ultrasound transducers (center frequencies 5 and 40 MHz) and optical condensers, we have photoacoustically imaged microvasculatures of small animals in vivo at different scales. Further, we have extended the field of view of our imaging system to entire bodies of small animals. At different imaging planes, we have noninvasively imaged the major blood vessels (e.g., descending aorta, intercostal vessels, cephalic vessels, brachial vessels, femoral vessels, popliteal vessels, lateral marginal vessels, cranial mesenteric vessels, mammalian vessels, carotid artery, jugular vein, subclavian vessels, iliac vessels, and caudal vessels) as well as intact internal organs (e.g., spleen, liver, kidney, intestine, cecum, and spinal cord) of the animals in vivo. The spectroscopic whole-body photoacoustic imaging clearly reveals the spectral responses of the internal structures. Similar to other existing preclinical whole-body imaging systems, this whole-body photoacoustic tomography can be a useful tool for small-animal research.	acoustic cryptanalysis;animal experimentation;autostereogram;blood vessel;bone structure of cranium;bone structure of ilium;cns disorder;carotid arteries;caudal;descending aorta;electron microscopy;gold;hypertensive disease;imaging system;intestinal wall tissue;lactic acid;lateral thinking;linear algebra;mammals;marginal model;megahertz;mesentery;ne (complexity);numerical aperture;organ;photoacoustic imaging;photoacoustic spectroscopy;renal tissue;sagittal plane;sodium;spinal cord;spleen tissue;status epilepticus;structure of jugular vein;structure of subclavian vein;tellurium;transducer;transducers;ultrasonography;unified model;veins;video-in video-out;whole body imaging;nickel;postoperative infection;tomography;wavelength;xian ling gu bao	Mansik Jeon;Jeesu Kim;Chul-hong Kim	2014	Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing	10.1007/s11517-014-1182-6	biology;radiology;anatomy;surgery	Vision	27.83124142796228	-82.47073464273363	138968

In patients afflicted by neurological diseases, hemiparetic gait is common and this abnormal gait causes the state of the art in motion reconstruction to fail. This paper presents two novel contributions to the area. The first is a novel gait trajectory reconstruction and visualization method with a zero velocity detection method targeting hemiparetic gait patterns, enabling reconstruction and visualization of hemiparetic gait in true 3D space. The second is a set of novel quality metrics developed in conjunction with the UCLA Department of Neurology, for evaluating patients suffering from neurological diseases.		Yan Wang;James Y.

In this paper, we employ a noniterative subspace model identification (SMI) algorithm to estimate parameters in a three- and four-element windkessel model by application of physical foreknowledge. Simulation data of the systemic circulation were used to investigate systematic and random errors in the parameter estimations. Results were compared with different methods as proposed in the literature: one closed-loop and two iterative methods for the three-element model, and one iterative method for the four-element model. For the three-element model, no significant systematic errors were observed using SMI. Concerning random errors, SMI appeared more robust in parameter estimations compared with the other methods ( P <; 0.05 for a signal-to-noise ratio of 18 dB). For the four-element model, a significant systematic error in the estimate of the arterial inertance L was observed (P = 0.011). However, for all methods, an increasing number of outliers in parameter estimates were observed at increased noise levels. These outliers were almost exclusive due to errors in estimates of L. In conclusion, with SMI physical parameters can mathematically be derived by application of physiological foreknowledge. For a three-element windkessel model, SMI appeared a very robust method to estimate parameters. However, application to a four-element windkessel model was less accurate because of low identifiability of L. Therefore, based on the simulation results, the use of the four-element windkessel model is questionable.	algorithm;estimated;excitation;finite element method;iterative method;population parameter;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;system identification	Taco Kind;Theo J.

Since brain atrophy is being increasingly used as a marker of disease progression in many neuro-degenerative diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, the validation of these tools is an important task. However, this is complex, in the real scenario, due to the absence of gold standards for comparison. In order to create gold standards, we first propose an approach for the realistic simulation of brain tissue loss that relies on the estimation of a topology preserving B-spline based deformation fields. Using these gold standards, an evaluation of the performance of three standard brain atrophy estimation methods (SIENA, SIENAX and BSI-UCD), on the basis of their robustness to various sources of error (bias-field inhomogeneity, noise, geometrical distortions, interpolation artefacts and presence of lesions), is presented. Our evaluation shows that, in general, bias-field inhomogeneity and noise lead to larger errors in the estimated atrophy than geometrical distortions and interpolation artefacts. Experiments on 18 different anatomical models of the brain after simulating whole brain atrophies in the range of 0.2-1.5% indicate that, in the presence of bias-field inhomogeneity and noise, a mean error of 0.64+/-0.53%,4.00+/-2.41% and 1.79+/-0.97% may be expected in the atrophy estimated by SIENA, SIENAX and BSI-UCD, respectively.

Construction of Virtual Articulator includes related research areas of computer graphics, virtual reality and medicine and tends to become a new paradigm as a tool because it will simulate and reproduce the movements of the TMJ in a realistic way, allowing a complete analysis of the case under treatment. It is a software which comes to replace and increase in an innovative way the work done by mechanical articulators. Initially Virtual Articulator reconstructs the TMJ virtually, generating a 3D model, starting from exams such as Computed Tomography and Magnetic Ressonance. Once it is obtained a virtual copy of the TMJ, software simulates real mandible movements, with great flexibility and facility of parameterization. Virtual joints model is based on points captured from the motion curve of lower incisor point. Contribution of each muscle in temporomandibular movement is approached from Hill actuators model and the new concept of curves of insertion. It will be possible to analyze in depth a particular case in a diagnostic phase or predict the results of the surgical procedure.	ct scan;computer graphics;programming paradigm;simulation;tomography;virtual reality	Marta Becker Villamil;Eduardo Garcia	2017				Graphics	38.5210863758305	-85.89614979641667	139545

There is the well known technique of comparing the reference image to a transformed secondary image [1], but evidence to support or deny accuracy of the transformation is still hard to obtain. This paper presents a technique to give researchers and clinicians clear visual evidence to validate the accuracy of 2D and 3D registration of medical images. It works by borrowing the computer vision technique of optical flow to compute disparities between the reference image and the transformed secondary image. The resulting disparity information may be presented as a needle diagram to assist with communication of results via paper, or used in subsequent steps of a registration algorithm.	algorithm;binocular disparity;computer vision;diagram;image registration;information source;optical flow;refinement (computing);whole earth 'lectronic link	James R.

44054a0e6e0ed8fd9ded85c59116e5d5eb8ee1fc	can planning images reduce scatter in follow-up cone-beam ct?		Due to its wide field of view, cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is plagued by large amounts of scatter, where attenuated photons hit the detector, and corrupt the linear models used for reconstruction. Given that one can generate a good estimate of scatter however, then image accuracy can be retained. In the context of adaptive radiotherapy, one usually has a low-scatter planning CT image of the same patient at an earlier time. Correcting for scatter in the subsequent CBCT scan can either be self consistent with the new measurements or exploit the prior image, and there are several recent methods that report high accuracy with the latter. In this study, we will look at the accuracy of various scatter estimation methods, how they can be effectively incorporated into a statistical reconstruction algorithm, along with introducing a method for matching off-line Monte-Carlo (MC) prior estimates to the new measurements. Conclusions we draw from testing on a neck cancer patient are: statistical reconstruction that incorporates the scatter estimate significantly outperforms analytic and iterative methods with pre-correction; and although the most accurate scatter estimates can be made from the MC on planning image, they only offer a slight advantage over the measurement based scatter kernel superposition (SKS) in reconstruction error.

The images presented are all either flat field or test object images and show artifacts previously either undescribed in the existing literature or meriting further comment. The artifacts described are caused by incorrect flat field corrections, a failing amplifier, damaged detector lines affecting their neighbors, lost information between neighboring detector tiles, image retention, delamination of a detector, poor setup of mechanical movements in CR, suckers damaging a CR plate, inappropriate use of grid suppression software, inappropriate use of a low pass spatial frequency filter, and unsharp masking filters. The causes and significance of the artifacts are explained and categorized as software or hardware related. Actions taken to correct the artifacts are described and explained.

We decompose the spectral description of h(x) into a scalar product of the spectral description of g(x) and a term that solely depends on f(x) and that is independent of g(x). We then use the method of stationary phase to derive the essential maximum frequency of g(f(x)) bounding the main portion of the energy of its spectrum. This limit is the product of the maximum frequency of g(x) and the maximum derivative of f(x). This leads to a proper sampling of the composition h of the two functions g and f. We apply our theoretical results to a fundamental open problem in volume rendering - the proper sampling of the rendering integral after the application of a transfer function. In particular, we demonstrate how the sampling criterion can be incorporated in adaptive ray integration, visualization with multi-dimensional transfer functions, and pre-integrated volume rendering	imagery;numerous;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;scientific visualization;spectral density estimation;stationary process;transfer function;volume rendering	Steven Bergner;Torsten Möller;Daniel Weiskopf;David J.

The performance of classic RANSAC and MS-RANSAC are compared using three different datasets. Results show that MS-RANSAC can locate needle correctly in complicated condition where classic RANSAC cannot. A parallel framework of the algorithm is designed and implemented using CUDA, making it usable in real time and online.	algorithm;cuda;ms-dos;mathematical optimization;numerous;paradiseo;puncture procedure;random sample consensus;real-time computing;wire-guided localization	Jing Jin;Ruixue Shen;Yue Zhao;Yang Xiao;Dandan Li;Yi Shen	2016	2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591631	algorithm design;computer vision;simulation;computer science;instruction set;interference;computer graphics (images)	Robotics	42.38975137790237	-83.96254604446025	140981

The proposed method allows to robustly reconstruct different indexes of back deformity used in the evaluation of scoliosis. The algorithm input data are the depth map and its corresponding curvature map. From these, regions-of-interest are automatically created and anatomical landmark positions are estimated by finding common patterns between subjects. The results showed that the proposed method can successfully estimate the anatomical landmark positions, as well as the 3D spine curve (average RMS error of 8 mm and 3 mm). The simplicity and generalisation abilities of the proposed method allow to pave the way of future diagnosis solutions for in-home or for small size practice use.	algorithm;depth map;kinect	Vincent Bonnet;Takazumi Yamaguchi;Arnaud Dupeyron;Sebastien Andary;Antoine Seilles;Philippe Fraisse;Gentiane Venture	2016	2016 6th IEEE International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics (BioRob)	10.1109/BIOROB.2016.7523746	computer vision;geography;engineering drawing;surgery	Robotics	40.92955542550707	-82.50731098524295	141036
2c81e3e60bf9950f694d77407bce9dde674cf135	3d prostate shape modeling from sparsely acquired 2d images using deformable models	radiation dose;boundary element;quality measurement;ultrasound imaging;model error;quality assessment;fourier descriptors;clinical outcome;ultrasonography;shape modeling;modeling;deformable model;prostate;radiation	Intraoperative quality assessment during prostate brachytherapy could improve the clinical outcome by ensuring the delivery of a prescribed tumoricidal radiation dose to the entire prostate gland. Accurate prostate boundary segmentation is an essential first step towards this. Classical segmentation techniques fail to generate a reliable edge map in ultrasound images. Modeling the 3D prostate shape in a deformable model framework could lead to more reliable prostate segmentation since missing information in some parts of the images due to the indistinct prostatic margins could be reconstructed using information in adjacent slices, and the resulting boundary elements could be integrated into a coherent mathematical description. We first experimented with deformable superquadrics to generate 3D surfaces that match the manually-outlined prostate contours. The superquadrics were found to capture the global shape, but had limited capability of modeling local shape variations. Then, closed and tubular surfaces were generated using Fourier descriptors to fit the prostate data. The modeling errors were compared with the disagreement between manual outlines by three experts. The preliminary results from 12 patient data sets show that the Fourier descriptors are capable of generating tubular surfaces that closely match the manual outlines. The minimum number of parameters required to reconstruct a tubular prostate surface with a tolerable error margin is 52.© (2004) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

As microwave ablation (MWA) is an effective method for the treatment of liver cancer, an ultrasound-directed (US-directed) robotic system was designed to assist surgeons on positioning the needle. This interventional robotic system includes a 5-DOF needle-guiding robot, a conventional 2D ultrasound device, a workstation for path planning and image processing and an electromagnetic tracking device. In clinical environments, we first use real-time freehand 3D ultrasound reconstruction and image analysis methods to attain tumour position, and then manipulate the guiding hole of the robot to position the needle affirmed by the surgeon. Finally, the feasibility of the interventional robotic system are validated by experimental results.	microwave;robot	Qiang Huang;Gui-bin Bian;Xingguang Duan;Hong-hua Zhao;Ping Liang	2010	Robotica	10.1017/S0263574709990634	ultrasound;biological engineering	Robotics	40.12476911440014	-86.22947113256046	141202

The potential applications of such a registration method could be in medicine; for example, in image guided interventions, surveillance and identification, industrial inspection, computer assisted manufacture, computer assisted maintenance, or telemanipulation in remote or hostile environments. Registration is performed by optimizing a similarity measure with respect to the transformation parameters. We propose a novel similarity measure based on aphoto-consistency.o For each surface point, the similarity measure computes how consistent the corresponding optical image information in each view is with a lighting model. The relative pose of the optical images must be known. We validate the system using data from an optical-based surface reconstruction system and surfaces derived from magnetic resonance (MR) images of the human face. We test the accuracy and robustness of the system with respect to the number of video images, video image noise, errors in surface location and area, and complexity of the matched surfaces. We demonstrate the algorithm working on 10 further optical-based reconstructions of the human head and skin surfaces derived from MR images of the heads of five volunteers. Matching four optical images to a surface model produced a 3D error of between 1.45 and 1.59 mm, at a success rate of 100 percent, where the initial misregistration was up to 16 mm or degrees from the registration position.

c029473438b753c4153baf77aca5cfca48109ec9	dense 3d reconstruction of endoscopic polyp		This paper proposes a model for 3D reconstruction of polyp in endoscopic scene. 3D shape of polyp enables better understanding of the medical condition and can help predict abnormalities like cancer. While there has been significant progress in monocular shape recovery, the same hasn’t been the case with endoscopic images due to challenges like specular regions. We take advantage of the advances in shape recovery and suitably apply these with modifications to the scenario of endoscopic images. The model operates on 2 nearby video frames. ORB features are detected and tracked for computing camera motion and initial rough depth estimation. This is followed by a dense pixelwise operation which gives a dense depth map of the scene. Our method shows positive results and strong correspondence with the ground truth.	3d reconstruction;depth map;frame (video);ground truth	Ankur Deka;Yuji Iwahori;Manas Kamal Bhuyan;Pradipta Sasmal;Kunio Kasugai	2018		10.5220/0006720701590166	3d reconstruction;computer science;computer vision;artificial intelligence	Vision	39.867045338796736	-82.90652262700215	141974

The transformation that registers the image pair should ideally be the inverse of the transformation that registers the pair with the order of images interchanged. This property is referred to as symmetry in registration or inverse consistent registration. However, in practical estimation, the available registration algorithms have tended to produce inverse inconsistent transformations when the template and target images are interchanged. In this paper, we propose two novel cost functions in the large deformation diffeomorphic framework that are inverse consistent. These cost functions have symmetric data-attachment terms; in the first, the matching error is measured at all points along the flow between template and target, and in the second, matching is enforced only at the midpoint of the flow between the template and target. We have implemented these cost functions and present experimental results to validate their inverse consistent property and registration accuracy.	attachments;clinical use template;error detection and correction;image registration;matching;medical image;algorithm;cell transformation;registration - actclass	Mirza Faisal Beg;Ali R.

76c6cc52a40d0817c8b35fcc2e65b1578fab2ed9	dynamic tracking of prosthetic valve motion and deformation from bi-plane x-ray views: feasibility study	3d modeling;visualization;x rays	Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) requires navigation and deployment of a prosthetic valve within the aortic annulus under fluoroscopic guidance. To support improved device visualization in this procedure, this study investigates the feasibility of frame-by-frame 3D reconstruction of a moving and expanding prosthetic valve structure from simultaneous bi-plane x-ray views. In the proposed method, a dynamic 3D model of the valve is used in a 2D/3D registration framework to obtain a reconstruction of the valve. For each frame, valve model parameters describing position, orientation, expansion state, and deformation are iteratively adjusted until forward projections of the model match both bi-plane views. Simulated bi-plane imaging of a valve at different signal-difference-to-noise ratio (SDNR) levels was performed to test the approach. 20 image sequences with 50 frames of valve deployment were simulated at each SDNR. The simulation achieved a target registration error (TRE) of the estimated valve model of 0.93 ± 2.6 mm (mean ± S.D.) for the lowest SDNR of 2. For higher SDNRs (5 to 50) a TRE of 0.04 mm ± 0.23 mm was achieved. A tabletop phantom study was then conducted using a TAVR valve. The dynamic 3D model was constructed from high resolution CT scans and a simple expansion model. TRE was 1.22 ± 0.35 mm for expansion states varying from undeployed to fully deployed, and for moderate amounts of inter-frame motion. Results indicate that it is feasible to use bi-plane imaging to recover the 3D structure of deformable catheter devices.	3d modeling;3d reconstruction;ct scan;deploy;diagnostic radiologic examination;frame (physical object);high-resolution computed tomography;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;plain x-ray;projections and predictions;scanning;simulation;tre;transcatheter aortic valve replacement;registration - actclass	Charles Hatt;Martin G.

Tilting the gantry introduces no complications for single-slice fan-beam systems; however, most systems today are helical multislice systems with up to 16 slices (and this number is sure to increase in the future). The image reconstruction algorithms used in multislice helical CT systems must be modified to compensate for the tilt. If they are not, the quality of reconstructed images will be poor with the presence of significant artifacts produced by the tilt. Practical helical multislice algorithms currently incorporated in today""""s systems include helical fan-beam, ASSR (Advanced single-slice rebinning), and Feldkamp algorithms. This paper presents the modifications necessary to compensate for gantry tilt for the helical cone-beam Feldkamp algorithm implemented by Toshiba (referred to as TCOT for true cone-beam tomography). Unlike some of the other algorithms, gantry tilt compensation is simple and straightforward to implement with no significant increase in computational complexity. It will be shown that the effect of the gantry tilt is to introduce a lateral shift in the isocenter of the reconstructed slice of interest, which is a function of the tilt, couch speed, and view angle. This lateral shift is easily calculated and incorporated into the backprojection algorithm. The tilt-compensated algorithm is called T-TCOT. Experimental tilted-gantry data has been obtained with 8- and 16 slice Toshiba Aquilion systems, and examples of uncompensated and tilt compensated images are presented.© (2003) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

The ability of a segmentation algorithm to correctly reproduce the geometry of the arterial system should be expressed quantitatively and observer-independently to ensure objectivism of the evaluation.   METHODS This paper introduces a methodology for validating vessel segmentation algorithms using a custom-designed MRA simulation framework. For this purpose, a realistic reference model of an intracranial arterial tree was developed based on a real Time-of-Flight (TOF) MRA data set. With this specific geometry blood flow was simulated and a series of TOF images was synthesized using various acquisition protocol parameters and signal-to-noise ratios. The synthesized arterial tree was then reconstructed using a level-set segmentation algorithm available in the Vascular Modeling Toolkit (VMTK). Moreover, to present versatile application of the proposed methodology, validation was also performed for two alternative techniques: a multi-scale vessel enhancement filter and the Chan-Vese variant of the level-set-based approach, as implemented in the Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK). The segmentation results were compared against the reference model.   RESULTS The accuracy in determining the vessels centerline courses was very high for each tested segmentation algorithm (mean error rate = 5.6% if using VMTK). However, the estimated radii exhibited deviations from ground truth values with mean error rates ranging from 7% up to 79%, depending on the vessel size, image acquisition and segmentation method.   CONCLUSIONS We demonstrated the practical application of the designed MRA simulator as a reliable tool for quantitative validation of MRA image processing algorithms that provides objective, reproducible results and is observer independent.

While the range of studies performed by non-invasive preclinical imaging is greatly varied, high sensitivity is of key importance in any biological experiment with molecular imaging probes. The technologies that are used to achieve high system sensitivity mostly focus on the use of large solid angles and dense scintillator materials. In this work, we investigate and discuss different preclinical Positron Emission Tomography system designs and the effects of these designs on the overall sensitivity. We focus our investigations in hypothetical system geometries and scintillator materials and perform Monte Carlo simulations. The results indicate that preclinical PET systems based on detector materials that have minimal intrinsic background and higher effective atomic number, might offer performance advantages for situations where the weakest signal possible needs to be detected.	molecular imaging;monte carlo method;preclinical imaging;simulation;tomography	Arion Chatziioannou;Qinan Bao;Nicolas A.

Unlike X-ray or magnetic resonance, which produce an image of the whole breast, ultrasound provides comparatively limited 2D or 3D views located around the lesions. Combining different modalities is an essential task for accurate diagnosis and simulating ultrasound images based on whole breast data could be a way toward correlating different information about the same lesion. Very few studies have dealt with such a simulation framework since the breast undergoes large scale deformation between the prone position of magnetic resonance imaging and the largely supine or lateral position of ultrasound. We present a framework for the realistic simulation of 3D ultrasound images based on prone magnetic resonance images from which a supine position is generated using a biomechanical model. The simulation parameters are derived from a real clinical infrastructure and from transducers that are used for routine scans, leading to highly realistic ultrasound images of any region of the breast.	lateral thinking;resonance;simulation;transducer	Renaud Morin;Björn Eiben;Luc M.

Threedimensional surface models facilitate the visual analysis of 3D anatomy. They also form a basis for standardized anatomical atlases that allow researchers to integrate, accumulate and associate heterogeneous experimental information, like functional or gene-expression data, with spatial or even spatio-temporal reference. Models are created by performing the following steps: image stitching, slice alignment, elastic registration, image segmentation and surface reconstruction. The proposed methods are to a large extent automatic and robust against inevitably occurring imaging artifacts. The option of interactive control at most stages of the modeling process complements automatic methods.	3d modeling;coherence (physics);critical section;elastic matching;image segmentation;image stitching	Vincent J.

We simulate both the invasion of the GBM in the brain parenchyma and its mechanical interaction (mass effect) with the invaded structures. The former effect is modeled with a reaction-diffusion equation while the latter is based on a linear elastic brain constitutive equation. In addition, we propose a new equation taking into account the mechanical influence of the tumor cells on the invaded tissues. This tumor growth model is assessed by comparing the virtual GBM growth with the real GBM growth observed between two MRIs of a patient acquired with six months difference.	brain implant;mass effect trilogy;mesa;population dynamics;simulation	Olivier Clatz;Pierre-Yves Bondiau;Hervé Delingette;Grégoire Malandain;Maxime Sermesant;Simon K.

It is a critical component in diagnostic medicine and a tool for studying the pathogenesis and biology of processes such as cancer and embryogenesis. Tissue processing for histology has become increasingly automated, drastically increasing the speed at which histology labs can produce tissue slides for viewing. Another trend is the digitization of these slides, allowing them to be viewed on a computer rather than through a microscope. Despite these changes, much of the routine analysis of tissue sections remains a painstaking, manual task that can only be completed by highly trained pathologists at a high cost per hour. There is, therefore, a niche for image analysis methods that can automate some aspects of this analysis. These methods could also automate tasks that are prohibitively time-consuming for humans, e.g., discovering new disease markers from hundreds of whole-slide images (WSIs) or precisely quantifying tissues within a tumor.	algorithm;call to action (marketing);computer;humans;image analysis;niche blogging;primer;relevance;signal processing	Michael T.

To compute vertebral body motion parameters we propose a comparative study between two segmentation methods proposed and applied to lateral X-ray images of the cervical spine. The two vertebra contour detection methods include (1) a discrete dynamic contour model (DDCM) and (2) a template matching process associated with a polar signature system. These two methods not only enable vertebra segmentation but also extract parameters that can be used to evaluate vertebral mobility. Lateral cervical spine views including 100 views in flexion, extension and neutral orientations were available for evaluation. Vertebral body motion was evaluated by human observers and using automatic methods. The results provided by the automated approaches were consistent with manual measures obtained by 15 human observers. The automated techniques provide acceptable results for the assessment of vertebral body mobility in flexion and extension on lateral views of the cervical spine.	computer vision;contour line;image segmentation;lateral computing;lateral thinking;template matching	Mohammed Benjelloun;Saïd Mahmoudi	2008	International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery	10.1007/s11548-008-0149-1	computer vision;simulation;template matching;computer science;comparative research;surgery	Vision	40.853630224876895	-81.93222720435179	143883

The tissue electric properties were varied to ascertain their influence on the induced currents. Current density magnitude and vector plots were generated throughout the tissue layers to determine the effects of tissue boundaries on the field. The current density magnitude correlated to the conductivity of the tissue in all the cases tested except where the tissue permittivity was raised to a level to allow for displacement currents. In this case, the permittivity of the tissue was the dominant factor. Current density components normal to the tissue interface were shown to exist in all solutions within the cortex contrary to the predictions of present models that rely on symmetrical geometries. Additionally, modifications in the cortical geometry were shown to perturb the field so that the site of activation could be altered in diseased patient populations. Finally, by varying the tissue permittivity values and the source frequency, we tested the effects of alpha dispersion theories on transcranial magnetic stimulation.	body tissue;displacement mapping;electrophoresis, gel, pulsed-field;finite element method;patients;perturbation theory;population;psychologic displacement;simulation;solutions;stimulation (motivation);transcranial magnetic stimulation;transcranial magnetic stimulation;anatomical layer	Tim A.

8470676a556092ef91744ca595311d8909391a62	pathological site retargeting under tissue deformation using geometrical association and tracking		Recent advances in microscopic detection techniques include fluorescence spectroscopy, fibred confocal microscopy and optical coherence tomography. These methods can be integrated with miniaturised probes to assist endoscopy, thus enabling diseases to be detected at an early and pre-invasive stage, forgoing the need for histopathological samples and off-line analysis. Since optical-based biopsy does not leave visible marks after sampling, it is important to track the biopsy sites to enable accurate retargeting and subsequent serial examination. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed for pathological site retargeting in gastroscopic examinations. The proposed method is based on affine deformation modelling with geometrical association combined with cascaded online learning and tracking. It provides online in vivo retargeting, and is able to track pathological sites in the presence of tissue deformation. It is also robust to partial occlusions and can be applied to a range of imaging probes including confocal laser endomicroscopy.	confocal laser endomicroscopy;hoare logic;microscopy, confocal;microscopy, fluorescence;obstruction;online and offline;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;sampling (signal processing);selenium:scnc:pt:ser/plas:qn;sentinel lymph node biopsy;site retargeting;video-in video-out;cell transformation;tomography	Menglong Ye;Stamatia Giannarou;Nisha Patel;Julian Teare;Guang-Zhong Yang	2013	Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ...

Because of possible motion of patients during the CTA examination, precise elimination of non-contrasted tissues, including bones, calcifications, and soft tissue, is still very challenging for lower legs, that is, from knees to toes. We propose novel registration-based framework for detection and correction of the motion in lower legs, which typically occurs between and during CTA pre-contrast and post-contrast acquisitions. Within the framework, two registration cores are proposed as alternatives, and resulting CTA subtraction images are compared with Advanced Vessel Analysis considered one of the reference commercial tools among clinical applications for CTA of lower extremities. The CTA subtraction images of 55 patients examined for PAOD are evaluated visually by four expert observers on the Philips Extended Brilliance Workspace using four criteria assessing the overall robustness of tested methods. According to the complex evaluation, the proposed framework enabled valuable improvements of CTA examination of lower legs.	arterial occlusive diseases;blood vessel;body tissue;brilliance;computed tomography angiography;excretory function;imagery;knee;limb structure;lower extremity;patients;peripheral arterial occlusive disease;physiologic calcification;skeletal bone;toes;workspace;x-ray computed tomography;angiogram;registration - actclass;soft tissue	Roman Peter;Milos Malinsky;Petr Ourednicek;Lukás Lambert;Jirí Jan	2013	Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing	10.1007/s11517-013-1085-y	radiology;medicine;image registration;computed tomography;nuclear medicine;medical physics	Vision	37.75867997676122	-81.17564914732114	144049

Among other imaging methods, the diminution harmonic imaging (DHI), which modells the diminution of contrast agent due to ultrasound pulses, is the most promising because of its speed. However, the current imaging quality of DHI is insufficient for reliable diagnoses. In this paper, we extend the mathematical DHI model to include the part of the intensity signal which is due to tissue reflections and other effects not based on the contrast agent and its concentration in the blood. We show in a phantom experiment with available perfusion ground truth the vast improvements in accuracy of the new model. Our findings also strongly support the theory of a linear relationship between the perfusion speed and the determined perfusion coefficient, which is a large step towards quantitative perfusion measurements.

Such variability can lead to differing noise characteristics among respiratory gates, which would adversely affect the accuracy of motion estimation. To address this difficulty, we develop a joint motion-estimation and image-reconstruction approach, in which the respiratory motion is estimated simultaneously along with the source distribution. In the experiments, we demonstrated this joint estimation-reconstruction approach with both quantitative simulated NCAT data and a set of clinical acquisition. We also explored its robustness with reduced imaging dose. The results show that the proposed approach can further improve the reconstructed myocardium over a pre-reconstruction motion-estimation approach.	experiment;heart rate variability;iterative reconstruction;motion estimation;reconstruction filter;spatial variability	Chao Song;Yongyi Yang;Miles N.

Thermal ablation of the valve was achieved through the application of radiofrequency (RF) electrical current. The objective was to apply enough energy to induce valve stiffening and retraction, which was hypothesized to produce valve insufficiency and blood regurgitation in vivo. Preliminary studies were performed to develop a workable energy delivery catheter that could be inserted through the carotid artery to the aortic valve. Catheter position between the aortic valve leaflets was verified by echocardiography. Valve function was evaluated before and after the thermal insult using Doppler measurements near the valve inflow and outflow, and early results demonstrate that the energy delivery catheter could successfully induce acute valve insufficiency. Further study is needed to refine the catheter to provide greater control over the degree of thermal damage and resulting changes in cardiac physiology.	aortic valve structure;convergence insufficiency;echocardiography;fleming valve;heart valves;heart failure;heart valve disease;hematological disease;leukemia, myelocytic, acute;liver damage;mitral valve insufficiency;regurgitation;thermal head;video-in video-out;physiological aspects;radiofrequency;thermal ablation therapy	Ashley M.

7026f1ab4a2b993698a09ad2834e642c34cf1657	susceptibility-resistant variable-flip-angle turbo spin echo imaging for reliable estimation of cortical thickness: a feasibility study	susceptibility;variable flip angle;mp rage;spin echo;magnetic resonance imaging;cortical thickness	The thickness of the human cerebral cortex, which provides valuable information in the studies of normal and abnormal neuroanatomy, is commonly estimated using high-resolution, volumetric magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE) magnetic resonance imaging due to its strong T1-weighted contrast and high signal-to-noise ratio. However, the accuracy of cortical thickness estimates using MP-RAGE is potentially contaminated by susceptibility-induced signal loss particularly at regions in close proximity to air-filled cavities. The purpose of this work is to investigate the feasibility of susceptibility-resistant variable-flip-angle (VFA) three-dimensional turbo/fast spin echo imaging for reliable estimation of cortical thickness of the human brain, wherein 1) radio-frequency (RF) pulse refocuses susceptibility-induced spin de-phasing, 2) the VFA refocusing pulse train is applied for a tissue-specific prescribed signal evolution along the echo train, 3) the desired T1-weighted contrast is achieved by composite restore pulses at the end of the refocusing pulse train, and 4) blood signals are suppressed using the VFA scheme combined with increasing moments of flow-sensitizing gradients while dura mater signals are attenuated due to short T2 relaxation time, which alleviates potential failure in brain segmentation. Numerical simulations of the Bloch equation are performed in both MP-RAGE and the proposed method for comparison. In vivo studies are performed in 14 healthy volunteers at 3 T. Image processing is then performed using the Freesurfer, resulting in mean and standard deviations of cortical thickness for the entire cortical surfaces. Statistical analysis demonstrates that particularly in the inferior prefrontal and temporal regions heavily affected by susceptibility-induced signal loss conventional MP-RAGE, if compared with the proposed method, significantly under-estimates cortical thickness. It is expected that the proposed pulse sequence, which is resistant to susceptibility-induced signal loss and attenuates the signal intensity of blood and dura mater, can be a potentially promising alternative to conventional MP-RAGE in reliably estimating cortical thickness for the entire brain.	ati rage;bloch sphere;cardiomyopathies;cerebral cortex;dura mater;estimated;fatty acids, volatile;fill;finite thickness;freesurfer;image processing;image resolution;linear programming relaxation;magnetic resonance imaging;magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo mri;neuroanatomy;numerical linear algebra;rabies virus ab:acnc:pt:ser:qn;radio frequency;sensorineural hearing loss (disorder);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spin echo;temporal lobe;thickness (graph theory);video-in video-out;volumetric display;brain segmentation;receptor for advanced glycation endproducts	Hyunyeol Lee;Eung-Yeop Kim;Kyung-Sook Yang;Jaeseok Park	2012	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.07.070	spin echo;radiology;medicine;magnetic resonance imaging	ML	45.84756206875223	-83.52464045792416	144234

Contemporary simulation models predominantly employ voxel-driven algorithms, but analytical models offer important advantages. The authors discuss the implementation of ray-solid intersection algorithms in analytical superquadric-based complex phantoms with additional speed-up rejection testing for use in nuclear medicine imaging simulations, and we make comparisons with voxelized counterparts. Comparisons are made with well-known cold rod:sphere and anthropomorphic phantoms. For these complex phantoms, the analytical phantom representations are nominally several orders of magnitude smaller in memory requirements than are voxelized versions. Analytical phantoms facilitate constant distribution parameters. As a consequence of discretizing a continuous surface into finite bins, for example, time-dependent voxelized phantoms can have difficulties preserving accurate volumes of a beating heart. Although virtually no inaccuracy is associated with path calculations in analytical phantoms, the discretization can negatively impact the simulation process and results. Discretization errors are apparent in reconstructed images of cold rod:sphere voxel-based phantoms because of a redistribution of the count densities in the simulated objects. These problems are entirely avoided in analytical phantoms. Voxelized phantoms can accurately model detailed human shapes based on segmented computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images, but analytical phantoms offer advantages in time and accuracy for evaluation and investigation of imaging physics and reconstruction algorithms in a straightforward and efficient manner.	algorithmic efficiency;allocation;approximation algorithm;ct scan;discretization;financial cost;hl7 data type;imaging system;imaging phantom;intersection of set of elements;magnetic resonance imaging;medical imaging;monte carlo method;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;photons;physical object;radionuclide imaging;random number generation;ray tracing (graphics);rejection sampling;requirement;simulation;small;superquadrics;version;voxel;x-ray computed tomography;density;orders - hl7publishingdomain	J.

However, due to the polydispersity of cells, the optimal condition is actually not reliable. In this study, based on the discrete concept developed in our previous work, the effect of the polydispersity on the recovery rate of cells in the dilution-filtration system was statistically investigated by assigning three random parameters, isotonic cell volume, cell surface area, and osmotically inactive cell volume, to cells in small units of blood. The results show that, due to the polydispersity, the real recovery rate deviates from the ideal value that is based on uniform distribution. The deviation significantly increases with the standard errors of cell parameters, and it can be also magnified by high cryoprotectant concentrations. Under the effect of polydispersity, the uniform distribution-based optimized blood or diluent flow rate is not perfect. In practice, one should adopt a more conservative blood or diluent flow rate so that the hypotonic damage to cells can be further reduced.	blood cells;cryopreservation;diluent;dilution of precision (navigation);erythrocytes;isotonic regression;red blood cell count measurement;filtration	Heyuan Qiao;Weiping Ding;Yuncong Ma;Sijie Sun;Dayong Gao	2014		10.1155/2014/792302	biology;osmosis;filtration;cryopreservation;algorithm;anatomy;surgery	HCI	33.54630384926935	-87.40002770222489	144426

Filament networks are encountered more and more commonly in biomedical imaging due to advances in high-throughput microscopy. These data sets are characterized by a complex volumetric network of thin filaments embedded in a scalar volume field. High-throughput microscopy volumes are also difficult to manage since they can require several terabytes of storage, even though the total volume of the embedded structure is much smaller. Filaments in microscopy data sets are difficult to segment because their diameter is often near the sampling resolution of the microscope, yet these networks can span large regions of the data set. We describe a novel method to trace filaments through scalar volume data sets that is robust to both noisy and undersampled data. We use graphics hardware to accelerate the tracing algorithm, making it more useful for large data sets. After the initial network is traced, we use an efficient encoding scheme to store volumetric data pertaining to the network.	algorithm;apache axis;artificial neural network;axis vertebra;biological models;blood vessel tissue;bone structure of radius;ct scan;cerebrovascular accident;complex network;cytoskeletal filaments;diameter (qualifier value);display list;embedded system;embedding;graphics processing unit;graphics hardware;high-throughput computing;ibm notes;imagery;intersection of set of elements;line code;medial graph;medical imaging;microscope device component;microvessels;my life as a teenage robot;neural network simulation;neurodegenerative disorders;neuron;neurons;parallel computing;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;semantic network;small;span distance;synaptic package manager;terabyte;throughput;united states national institutes of health;volume;algorithm;benefit;biologic segmentation;nervous system disorder	David Mayerich;John Keyser	2009	IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics	10.1109/TVCG.2008.196	acceleration;high-throughput screening;sampling;ray tracing;computer vision;hardware acceleration;computer science;microscopy;graphics;theoretical computer science;magnetic resonance imaging;optical imaging;feature detection;tracking;image segmentation;computer graphics;segmentation;graphics hardware;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	47.088300617999415	-80.22277438302187	144446
328db96b0ff8fa9cd7723d9066fae1fbaa3c172b	a statistical shape model of the human second cervical vertebra	statistical shape model;segmentation;non rigid image registration;second cervical vertebra;principal component analysis	Statistical shape and appearance models play an important role in reducing the segmentation processing time of a vertebra and in improving results for 3D model development. Here, we describe the different steps in generating a statistical shape model (SSM) of the second cervical vertebra (C2) and provide the shape model for general use by the scientific community. The main difficulties in its construction are the morphological complexity of the C2 and its variability in the population. The input dataset is composed of manually segmented anonymized patient computerized tomography (CT) scans. The alignment of the different datasets is done with the procrustes alignment on surface models, and then, the registration is cast as a model-fitting problem using a Gaussian process. A principal component analysis (PCA)-based model is generated which includes the variability of the C2. The SSM was generated using 92 CT scans. The resulting SSM was evaluated for specificity, compactness and generalization ability. The SSM of the C2 is freely available to the scientific community in Slicer (an open source software for image analysis and scientific visualization) with a module created to visualize the SSM using Statismo, a framework for statistical shape modeling. The SSM of the vertebra allows the shape variability of the C2 to be represented. Moreover, the SSM will enable semi-automatic segmentation and 3D model generation of the vertebra, which would greatly benefit surgery planning.	3d modeling;align (company);apricot kernel oil;axis vertebra;bone tissue;bone structure of spine;ct scan;cervical vertebrae;curve fitting;data structure alignment;eigen (c++ library);gaussian process;generalization (psychology);image analysis;imagery;instability;kernel density estimation;kinetic data structure;manifold alignment;neck;neoplasms;normal statistical distribution;numerous;open-source software;operative surgical procedures;patients;point-to-point protocol;polygonal modeling;principal component analysis;reference surface;robot;seizures, scoliosis, and macrocephaly syndrome;scanning;scientific visualization;scoliosis, unspecified;semiconductor industry;sensitivity and specificity;spatial variability;statistical shape analysis;trusted computer system evaluation criteria;wounds and injuries;algorithm;anonymized;biologic segmentation;registration - actclass	Marine Clogenson;John M.

Automated methods for segmenting several anatomy structures in chest CT are proposed: namely the lobe lungs, airway tree and pulmonary vessel tree. The airway and pulmonary vessel trees are segmented using a failure tracking and recovery algorithm. The algorithm checks intermediary results consistence, backtrack to a history position if a failure is detected. The quality of the result is improved while reducing the processing time even for subjects with lung diseases. The pulmonary vessels are segmented through the same algorithm with different seed points. The seed for the airway tree segmentation is within the tracheal tube, and the seed for the pulmonary vessels segmentation is within the heart. The algorithm is tested with CT images acquired from four distinct types of subjects: healthy, idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs), usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The main bronchi are found in the segmented airway and the associated lung lobes are determined. Combining the segmented lung lobes and the diffuse lung diseases classification, it is possible to quantify how much and where each lobe is injured. The results were compared with a conventional 3D region growing algorithm and commercial systems. Several results were compared to medical doctor evaluations: inter-lobe fissure, percentage of lung lobe that is injured and lung and lobe volumes.

The approach relies on the optimization of a global energy function, based on the object shape, measuring the similarity between a slice and its neighborhood in the 3-D volume. Slice similarity is computed using the distance transform measure in both directions. No particular direction is privileged in the method avoiding global offsets, biases in the estimation and error propagation. The method was evaluated on real images [medical, biological, and other computerized tomography (CT) scanned 3-D data] and the experimental results demonstrated its accuracy as reconstuction errors are less than one degree in rotation and less than one pixel in translation.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;alignment;ct scan;distance transform;mathematical optimization;pixel;propagation of uncertainty;scanning;software propagation;x-ray computed tomography	Stelios Krinidis;Christophoros Nikou;Ioannis Pitas	2003	IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine	10.1109/TITB.2003.811866	iterative reconstruction;stereoscopy;computer vision;index term;radiology;medicine;computer science;image registration;computer graphics (images)	Vision	45.41030392739935	-80.76099240123503	145003
f4ce3462a4320322f0ffd741a655d3cb36223f83	autocorrelation kernel support vector machines for doppler ultrasound m-mode images denoising		Doppler ultrasound M-mode images are routinely used in clinical echocardiography, and they have been proposed for non-invasive estimation of the intracardiac pressure gradients in the heart, a process that has been shown to be sensitive to spline interpolation. In this work, we scrutinized the effect of interpolation with a new approach using support vector machines (SVM) for estimation using autocorrelation Mercer kernels in ultrasound images. The SVM algorithm was modified to provide the estimation of a whole image in terms of a reduced set of pixels used as training data set. The autocorrelation of the color Doppler M-mode (CDMM) image was estimated with conventional cross-correlation by considering the complete image, and it was used as the Mercer kernel required by SVM. Several subsampling strategies were scrutinized, namely, a heuristic approach, a criterion based on the edges, and a criterion based on the amplitudes. In order to evaluate the proposed methods, we analyzed a previously proposed Doppler image synthetic model, as well as case study with a real image. Results in terms of mean absolute error showed that the minimum error is obtained when information from the edges is considered, yielding 7.37 for single width radial basis function, 2.80 for double with radial basis function, and 0.80 for autocorrelation kernel. The autocorrelation kernel provides with an accurate estimation of the spatiotemporal distribution of flow velocity within the heart using CDMM images. This methodology can be further exploited for enhancing the sensitivity of the pressure gradients estimation to polynomial interpolation and then for improving noninvasive cardiovascular diagnosis.	algorithm;approximation error;autocorrelation;chroma subsampling;cross-correlation;doppler effect;experiment;floating-point unit;gradient;heuristic;medical ultrasound;noise reduction;nonlinear system;pixel;polynomial interpolation;principle of good enough;radial (radio);radial basis function;spline interpolation;support vector machine;synthetic intelligence;test set;velocity (software development);video post-processing	Cristina Soguero-Ruíz;Alicia Guerrero-Curieses;Francisco Javier Palancar;Javier Bermejo;José Carlos Antoranz;José Luis Rojo-Álvarez	2016	2016 Computing in Cardiology Conference (CinC)		mathematical optimization;pattern recognition;mathematics;autocorrelation technique;statistics	Vision	50.39625021683923	-85.39911832470759	145164
0a0077409fa49fa429b3388980ccd6e1119ab291	histocad: machine facilitated quantitative histoimaging with computer assisted diagnosis	computer assisted diagnosis;prostate specific antigen	Prostatic adenocarcinoma (CAP) is the most common malignancy in American men. In 2010 there will be an estimated 217,730 new cases and 32,050 deaths from CAP in the US. The diagnosis of prostatic adenocarcinoma is made exclusively from the histological evaluation of prostate tissue. The sampling protocols used to obtain 18 gauge (1.5 mm diameter) needle cores are standard sampling templates consisting of 6-12 cores performed in the context of an elevated serum value for prostate specific antigen (PSA). In this context, the prior probability of cancer is somewhat increased. However, even in this screened population, the efficiency of finding cancer is low at only approximately 20%. Histopathologists are faced with the task of reviewing the 5-10 million cores of tissue resulting from approximately 1,000,000 biopsy procedures yearly, parsing all the benign scenes from the worrisome scenes, and deciding which of the worrisome images are cancer.#R##N##R##N#All prostate cancer is not biologically the same. Some cancers are progressive despite therapy and eventually kill the patient. Other cancers are indolent. Our ability to separate aggressive from indolent cancer is good but limited to population statistics describing the distribution of features such as tumor size, tumor stage, PSA value, and tumor grade. The Gleason grading system of CAP is the single most powerful feature for the prediction of outcome in CAP. The Gleason grading system recognizes 5 basic architectural patterns which structurally describe a disturbance of normal inter-glandular organizational relationships on a 2-10 scoring scale. The bins of score 6 or less; score 7; and score 8 or more have significantly different biological outcomes in meta-analysis. In assigning Gleason grade the accurate identification of Gleason patterns 4 and 5 is the most important task for the histopathologist. Inter-observer variance in the recognition of Gleason patterns 4/5 is an important limitation in grading. Educational programs can improve concordance across labs.#R##N##R##N#Machine facilitated quantitative histoimaging with computer assisted diagnosis (HistoCAD) offers an algorithmic classifier approach to Gleason grading with the promise of near 100% reproducibility. Recent improvements in virtual slide scanning technology allow for ready access to whole slide digital images on which to focus computational solutions. There are, however, many challenges to effective HistoCAD programs.		John E.

Such studies require the processing and analysis of huge amounts of image data, and manual image analysis is very time consuming, thus costly, and also potentially inaccurate and poor reproducibility. In this paper, we present and combine several advanced computational, probabilistic, and fuzzy-set methods for the computerized classification of cell nuclei in different mitotic phases. We tested our proposed methods with real image sequences recorded over a period of twenty-four hours at every fifteen minutes with a time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. The experimental results have shown that the proposed methods are effective for the task of classification.	algorithm;image analysis	Tuan D. Pham;Dat T. Tran;Xiaobo Zhou;Stephen T. C.

In this paper, we present a method for real time processing of diffusion tensor and Q-ball imaging. The basic idea is to use Kalman filtering framework to fit either the linear tensor or Q-ball model. Because the Kalman filter is designed to be an incremental algorithm, it naturally enables updating the model estimate after the acquisition of any new diffusion-weighted volume. Processing diffusion models and maps during ongoing scans provides a new useful tool for clinicians, especially when it is not possible to predict how long a subject may remain still in the magnet.	addresses (publication format);algorithm;diffusion anisotropy;diffusion tensor imaging;evaluation;feedback;increment;kalman filter;magnet <device>;map;online and offline;real-time clock;real-time computing;resonance;signal-to-noise ratio;word lists by frequency	Cyril Poupon;Fabrice Poupon;Alexis Roche;Yann Cointepas;Jessica Dubois;Jean-Francois Mangin	2007	Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ...

The video is usually reviewed many times to refine the diagnosis, resulting in loss of time since the salient frames of the video are mixed with blurred, noisy, and redundant frames caused by the endoscope movements. The aim of this work is to provide to the clinician a unique larynx panorama, obtained through an automatic frame selection strategy to discard non-informative frames. Anisotropic diffusion filtering was exploited to lower the noise level while encouraging the selection of meaningful image features, and a feature-based stitching approach was carried out to generate the panorama. The frame selection strategy, tested on on six pathological NB endoscopic videos, was compared with standard strategies, as uniform and random sampling, showing higher performance of the subsequent stitching procedure, both visually, in terms of vascular structure preservation, and numerically, through a blur estimation metric.	anisotropic diffusion;biologic preservation;blood vessel;corneal dystrophy, band-shaped;documentation;endoscope device component;endoscopes;frame (physical object);gaussian blur;ground truth;image stitching;information;ion beam deposition;irritable bowel syndrome;large;larynx;movement;naive bayes classifier;neoplasms;noise (electronics);noise reduction;numerical analysis;refinement (computing);sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;silo (dataset);synthetic data;videocassette	Sara Moccia;Veronica Penza;Gabriele Omodeo Vanone;Elena De Momi;Leonardo S.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the analysis of joints which combines the patient-specific virtual and physical simulation. The patient-specific anatomical structure and hip motion was obtained from CT and optical motion capture. The virtual simulation was conducted by integrating these data using virtual reality technique. The physical simulation was achieved by using plaster models of the patient's pelvis and femur and robotic manipulator. The plaster models were driven by two robotic manipulators to reproduce the hip motion. The accuracy of the robot movement was 0.245 mm over the working area according to the validation by an optical tracking system. By combining this system with linear actuators that reproduce the muscle functions, patient-specific muscle function can be simulated, thereby helping clinicians to diagnose and make a treatment plan.	anatomic structures;articular system;bone tissue;dynamical simulation;hip joint;motion capture;muscle function;patients;plaster;robot;tracking system;virtual reality;hip arthroplasty	Yoshito Otake;Naoki Suzuki;Asaki Hattori;Hidenobu Miki;Mitsuyoshi Yamamura;Kazuo Yonenobu;Takahiro Ochi;Nobuhiko Sugano	2008	Studies in health technology and informatics		computer vision;data mining;artificial intelligence;motion analysis;medicine	Robotics	39.08574138939111	-85.0413514421202	146048

Such research is integrally based on advanced algorithms to derive extensive radiomic features and integrate them into diagnostic and predictive models. To exploit the benefit of such complex algorithms, their swift translation into clinical practice is required, currently hindered by their complicated nature. brain-CaPTk is a modular platform, with components spanning across image processing, segmentation, feature extraction, and machine learning, that facilitates such translation, enabling quantitative analyses without requiring substantial computational background. Thus, brain-CaPTk can be seamlessly integrated into the typical quantification, analysis and reporting workflow of a radiologist, underscoring its clinical potential. This paper describes currently available components of brain-CaPTk and example results from their application in glioblastoma.

However, surgeons are currently limited to fetoscopy and external ultrasound imaging, which are unable to accurately identify all vessels especially those that are narrow and at the periphery. Laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) is an optical method for imaging blood flow that is emerging as an intraoperative tool for neurosurgery. Here we explore the application of LSCI to minimally invasive fetal surgery, with an endoscopic LSCI system based on a 2.7-mm-diameter fetoscope. We establish using an optical phantom that it can image flow in 1-mm-diameter vessels as far as 4 mm below the surface. We demonstrate that a spatiotemporal algorithm produces the clearest images of vessels within 200 ms, and that speckle contrast images can be accurately registered using groupwise registration to correct for significant motion of target or probe. When tested on a perfused term ex vivo human placenta, our endoscopic LSCI system revealed small capillaries not evident in the fetoscopic images.	algorithm;medical ultrasound;phantom reference;video-in video-out	Gustavo Sato dos Santos;Efthymios Maneas;Daniil I.

2b479cf414327689ae522bd525ade4f1326d98c7	m-amst: an automatic 3d neuron tracing method based on mean shift and adapted minimum spanning tree	computational biology bioinformatics;algorithms;computer appl in life sciences;microarrays;bioinformatics	Understanding the working mechanism of the brain is one of the grandest challenges for modern science. Toward this end, the BigNeuron project was launched to gather a worldwide community to establish a big data resource and a set of the state-of-the-art of single neuron reconstruction algorithms. Many groups contributed their own algorithms for the project, including our mean shift and minimum spanning tree (M-MST). Although M-MST is intuitive and easy to implement, the MST just considers spatial information of single neuron and ignores the shape information, which might lead to less precise connections between some neuron segments. In this paper, we propose an improved algorithm, namely M-AMST, in which a rotating sphere model based on coordinate transformation is used to improve the weight calculation method in M-MST. Two experiments are designed to illustrate the effect of adapted minimum spanning tree algorithm and the adoptability of M-AMST in reconstructing variety of neuron image datasets respectively. In the experiment 1, taking the reconstruction of APP2 as reference, we produce the four difference scores (entire structure average (ESA), different structure average (DSA), percentage of different structure (PDS) and max distance of neurons’ nodes (MDNN)) by comparing the neuron reconstruction of the APP2 and the other 5 competing algorithm. The result shows that M-AMST gets lower difference scores than M-MST in ESA, PDS and MDNN. Meanwhile, M-AMST is better than N-MST in ESA and MDNN. It indicates that utilizing the adapted minimum spanning tree algorithm which took the shape information of neuron into account can achieve better neuron reconstructions. In the experiment 2, 7 neuron image datasets are reconstructed and the four difference scores are calculated by comparing the gold standard reconstruction and the reconstructions produced by 6 competing algorithms. Comparing the four difference scores of M-AMST and the other 5 algorithm, we can conclude that M-AMST is able to achieve the best difference score in 3 datasets and get the second-best difference score in the other 2 datasets. We develop a pathway extraction method using a rotating sphere model based on coordinate transformation to improve the weight calculation approach in MST. The experimental results show that M-AMST utilizes the adapted minimum spanning tree algorithm which takes the shape information of neuron into account can achieve better neuron reconstructions. Moreover, M-AMST is able to get good neuron reconstruction in variety of image datasets.	algorithm;big data;esa;experiment;file spanning;gene regulatory network;how much distress other symptom 2;list of algorithms;mean shift;minimum spanning tree;neuron;xpnpep2 gene	Zhijiang Wan;Yishan He;Ming Hao;Jian Yang;Ning Zhong	2017		10.1186/s12859-017-1597-9	coordinate system;spatial analysis;big data;minimum spanning tree;bioinformatics;mean-shift;artificial intelligence;machine learning;tracing;computer science	Vision	32.611486433255656	-83.41820209357712	147044

Simulations also show that even a small gap in the final lesion relative to the isthmus will result in perpetuation of reentry following RF ablation. The model has potential utility in RF treatment planning for reentry associated with ventricular structural disease (e.g. infarct).

However, inferring heterogeneous microstructures of an imaging voxel rapidly remains a challenge in DSI because of extensive sampling requir ements in a Cartesian grid of q-space. In this study, we propose compressed sensing based diffusion spectrum imaging (CS-DSI) to significantly reduce the number of diffusion measurements required for accurate estimation of fiber orientations. This method reconstructs each diffusion propagator of an MR data set from 100 variable density undersampled diffusion measurements minimizing the l1-norm of the finite-differences (i.e.,anisotropic total variation) of the diffusion propagator. The proposed method is validated against a ground truth from synthetic data mimicking the FiberCup phantom, demonstrating the robustness of CS-DSI on accurately estimating underlying fiber orientations from noisy diffusion data. We demonstr ate the effectiveness of our CS-DSI method on a human brain dataset acquired from a clinical scanner without specialized pulse sequences. Estimated ODFs from CS-DSI method are qualitatively compared to those from the full dataset (DSI203). Lastly, we demonstrate that streamline tractography based on our CS-DSI method has a comparable quality to conventional DSI203. This illustrates the feasibility of CS-DSI for reconstructing whole brain white-matter fiber tractography from clinical data acquired at imaging centers, includi ng hospitals, for human brain connectivity studies.

Specifically, we focus on tuning-up a previously developed probabilistic tracking algorithm by making use of a genetic algorithm  which helps to optimize most of the adjustable parameters of the tracking algorithm. Since the adjustment of these parameters  constitutes a hard NP-complete problem, traditionally, this task has been heuristically approached. In previous work, we have  already developed a multilayer neural network that was successfully applied to this issue. Though robustness was one of its  major advantages, the complexity of the whole algorithm constituted its main drawback. In order to avoid this situation, here  we have explored the possibility of using a computationally simpler method based on a micro-genetic algorithm. This strategy  is shown to outperform the NN-based scheme, leading to a more robust, efficient and human independent tracking scheme. The  tracking of white matter fibers in the human brain will improve the diagnosis and treatment of many neuronal diseases.  	algorithm;software release life cycle	Luis M.

Visualization and assessment of the tracking error should take place in the operating room with minimal interferenc e with the clinical procedure. The goal was to achieve this ideal in an open -source software implementation in a plug and play manner, without requiring programming from the user . Methods : We use optical tracking as a ground truth . An electromagnetic sensor and optical markers are mounted onto a stylus device, pivot calibrated for both trackers. Electromagnetic tracking error is defined as difference of tool tip position between electromagnetic and optical readings. Multiple measurements are interpolated into the thin -plate B -spline transform visualized in real time using 3D Slicer. All tracked devices are used in a plug and play manner through the open -source SlicerIGT and PLUS extensions of the 3D Slicer platform. R esults : Tracking error was measured multiple times to assess reproducibility of the method, bot h with and without placing ferromagnetic objects in the workspace. Results from exhaustive grid sampling and freehand sampling were similar, indicating that a quick free hand sampling is sufficient to detect unexpected or excessive field distortion in the operating room. Conclusion: The software is available as a plug -in for the 3D Slicer platforms. Results demonstrate potential for visualizing electromagnetic tracking error in real time for intraoperative environments in feasibility clinical trials in image -guided interventions.

The aim of this work is to investigate the effects of tissue anisotropy, cellular action potential duration (APD) heterogeneities and excitation wavefront shape on the T wave polarity in unipolar and bipolar ECGs, simulated in a conducting medium surrounding the cardiac tissue at some distance fom endo to epicardium. The study is based on three-dimensional anisotropic Monodomain simulations of the entire depolarization and repolarization phases of propagating action potentials in a parallelepipedal slab. The results show that the T wave of unipolar ECGs is positive at all sites explored and its shape and polarity are mainly determined by the anisotropy of the cardiac tissue, irrespective of cellular APD heterogeneities and shape of the excitation wavefront. On the other hand, bipolar ECGs are mainly affected by their isotropic component and their T wave turns out to be positive for single site stimulations in the presence of transmural APD heterogeneity, while it becomes always negative in case of multiple sites stimulation generating large activation wavefronts, regardless of the considered cellular APD heterogeneities.

Input data must conform to the assumptions within the algorithm if useful results are to be achieved. Automation of this process is essential if vision algorithms are to form components in analysis systems. In this paper we present a technique to validate the correction of field inhomogeneity in MR images. The initial intention was to use information measures to check the improvement due to correction. However, it will be shown that the standard log entropy calculation for information measurement does not have the required properties, specifically grey-level scale invariance. We present an alternative, scaleinvariant information measure derived using conventional likelihood approaches, that can be applied as an absolute measure of information content. We show this technique in use for the validation of our existing coil correction method [9].	algorithm;automation;image analysis;self-information	Neil A. Thacker;A. J. Lacey;Paul A.

Six scanners based on different scanning principles (Minolta Vivid 910®, Polhemus FastSCAN™, GFM PRIMOS®, GFM TopoCAM®, Steinbichler Comet® Vario Zoom 250, 3dMD DSP 400®) were used to measure five sheep skulls of different sizes. In three areas with varying anatomical complexity (areas, 1 = high; 2 = moderate; 3 = low), 56 distances between 20 landmarks are defined on each skull. Manual measurement (MM), coordinate machine measurements (CMM) and computer tomography (CT) measurements were used to define a reference method for further precision and accuracy evaluation of different 3-D scanning systems. MM showed high correlation to CMM and CT measurements (both r = 0.987; p < 0.001) and served as the reference method. TopoCAM®, Comet® and Vivid 910® showed highest measurement precision over all areas of complexity; Vivid 910®, the Comet® and the DSP 400® demonstrated highest accuracy over all areas with Vivid 910® being most accurate in areas 1 and 3, and the DSP 400® most accurate in area 2. In accordance to the measured distance length, most 3-D devices present higher measurement precision and accuracy for large distances and lower degrees of precision and accuracy for short distances. In general, higher degrees of complexity are associated with lower 3-D assessment accuracy, suggesting that for optimal results, different types of scanners should be applied to specific clinical applications and medical problems according to their special construction designs and characteristics.	bone structure of cranium;ct scan;capability maturity model;comet assay;complexity;corneal pachymetry;distance;gfm1 protein, human;gain;maxillo-mandibular reconstruction;primos;variometer;x-ray computed tomography	Maximilian Eder;Gernot Brockmann;Alexander Zimmermann;Moschos A.

It utilizes a subset of standard rotational X-ray angiography projections that correspond to one single cardiac phase. The algorithm is based on a fast marching approach, which selects voxels in 3D space that belong to the vascular structure and introduces a hierarchical order. The local 3D propagation speed is determined by a combination of corresponding 2D projections filtered with a vessel enhancing kernel. The best achievable accuracy of the algorithm is evaluated on simulated projections of a virtual heart phantom, showing that it is capable of extracting coronary centerlines with an accuracy that is mainly limited by projection and volume quantization (0.25 mm). The algorithm is reasonably insensitive to residual motion, which means that it is able to cope with inconsistencies within the projection data set caused by limited gating accuracy and respiration. Its accuracy on clinical data is evaluated based on expert ratings of extracted models of 17 consecutive clinical cases (10 LCA, 7 RCA). A success rate of 93.5% (i.e. with no or slight deviations) is achieved compared to 58.8% success rate of semi-automatically extracted models.

For mathematical modeling of heterogeneous cell populations, one typically has to reconstruct the underlying heterogeneity from measurements on the population level. Based on recent insights into the mathematical nature of this problem as an inverse problem of tomographic type, we evaluate numerical methods to perform such a reconstruction in basic case studies. We compare a kernel density based optimization approach, filtered back projection, and algebraic reconstruction techniques.

a4a0ad45f6a059d35bf8ceea7b414e525e08e926	automated aortic calcification detection in low-dose chest ct images	image segmentation;electrocardiography;computing systems;chest	The extent of aortic calcification has been shown to be a risk indicator for vascular events including cardiac events. We have developed a fully automated computer algorithm to segment and measure aortic calcification in low-dose noncontrast, non-ECG gated, chest CT scans. The algorithm first segments the aorta using a pre-computed Anatomy Label Map (ALM). Then based on the segmented aorta, aortic calcification is detected and measured in terms of the Agatston score, mass score, and volume score. The automated scores are compared with reference scores obtained from manual markings. For aorta segmentation, the aorta is modeled as a series of discrete overlapping cylinders and the aortic centerline is determined using a cylinder-tracking algorithm. Then the aortic surface location is detected using the centerline and a triangular mesh model. The segmented aorta is used as a mask for the detection of aortic calcification. For calcification detection, the image is first filtered, then an elevated threshold of 160 Hounsfield units (HU) is used within the aorta mask region to reduce the effect of noise in low-dose scans, and finally non-aortic calcification voxels (bony structures, calcification in other organs) are eliminated. The remaining candidates are considered as true aortic calcification. The computer algorithm was evaluated on 45 low-dose non-contrast CT scans. Using linear regression, the automated Agatston score is 98.42% correlated with the reference Agatston score. The automated mass and volume score is respectively 98.46% and 98.28% correlated with the reference mass and volume score.		Yiting Xie;Yu Maw Htwe;Jennifer Padgett;Claudia I. Henschke;David F.

The aim of this work is to develop an automated method for determining the contour of multiple objects in positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) filtered backprojection (FBP) reconstructed images. These contours can be used for computing body edges for attenuation correction in PET and SPECT, as well as for eliminating streak artifacts outside the objects, which could be useful in compressive sensing reconstruction. Contour detection has been accomplished by applying a modified cumulative sums (CUSUM) scheme in the sinogram. Our approach automatically detects all objects in the image, without requiring a priori knowledge of the number of distinct objects in the reconstructed image. This method has been tested in simulated phantoms, such as an image-quality (IQ) phantom and two digital multi-object phantoms, as well as a real NEMA phantom and a clinical thoracic study. For this purpose, a GE Discovery PET scanner was employed. The detected contours achieved root mean square accuracy of 1.14 pixels, 1.69 pixels and 3.28 pixels and a Hausdorff distance of 3.13, 3.12 and 4.50 pixels, for the simulated image-quality phantom PET study, the real NEMA phantom and the clinical thoracic study, respectively. These results correspond to a significant improvement over recent results obtained in similar studies. Furthermore, we obtained an optimal sub-pattern assignment (OSPA) localization error of 0.94 and 1.48, for the two-objects and three-objects simulated phantoms, respectively. Our method performs efficiently for sets of convex objects and hence it provides a robust tool for automatic contour determination with precise results.		Nicholas E. Protonotarios;George M.

In this work, the authors used a model of a prolate spheroidal cell in a uniform external field (Klee and Plonsey, 1976) to predict the threshold electric field (ET) for stimulation of isolated ventricular myocytes of rats at different ages. The model assumes that ET is primarily determined by cell shape and dimensions, which markedly change during postnatal development. Neonatal cells showed very high ET, which progressively decreased with maturation (experimental mean values were 29, 21, 13, and 5.9 and 6.3 V/cm for 3-6, 13-16, 20-21, 28-35, and 120-180 day-old rats, respectively, P<0.001; theoretical values were 24, 18, 11, 9, and 6 V/cm, respectively). Estimated maximum membrane depolarization at threshold (/spl Delta/V/sub T//spl ap/35 mV, under the authors' experimental conditions) was reasonably constant during development, except for cells from 1-mo-old animals, in which /spl Delta/VT was lower than at other ages. It is concluded that the model reasonably correlates ET with cell geometry and size in most cases. The authors' results might be relevant for the development of efficient procedures for defibrillation of pediatric patients.	anatomical maturation;artificial cardiac pacemaker;dimensions;electric countershock;electroconvulsive therapy;heart cell;leukemia, b-cell;muscle cells;myocytes, cardiac;patients;prolate spheroidal wave function;electric field;gamma-delta t-cell receptor;membrane depolarization	Paulo Alberto P.

The application of these techniques in treatment planning usually involves serious complications and limitations due to the huge number of variables appearing in the planning process. This leads to large computation times and memory requirements. In this paper, strategies and algorithmic issues are proposed in order to cope with these limitations.

There is an observed difference in 2D and 3D visualization objectives of the various groups of specialists. We describe a generalized temporal focus + context framework that unifies different widely used and novel visualization methods. The framework is used to classify already existing common techniques and to define new techniques that can be used in medical volume visualization. The new techniques explore the time-dependent position of the framework focus region to combine 2D and 3D rendering inside the focus and to provide a new focus-driven context region that gives explicit spatial perception cues between the current and past regions of interest. An arbitrary-shaped focus region and no context rendering are two novel framework-based techniques that support improved planning of procedures that involve drilling or endoscopic exploration. The new techniques are quantitatively compared to already existing techniques by means of a user study.	3d printing;3d rendering;imagery;operative surgical procedures;region of interest;scientific visualization;space perception;usability testing;visualization (graphics)	Nadezhda Radeva;Lucien Levy;James K.

The regional distribution of fibrosis is often described qualitatively and quantitatively in histological studies of animal hearts after staining collagen with specific colored stains. Currently this description is often piecemeal, as it lacks rigorous spatial registration, matching and methodological standardization between animals and between study groups. We propose a strategy for the quantification of regional fibrosis using the American Heart Association (AHA) cardiac segmentation model. We quantify fibrosis after whole heart 3D histological reconstruction in one normal rat heart and in one rat heart in right heart failure induced by monocrotaline. We then assess the minimum spaced histological sampling which allows for accurate assessment of regional fibrosis. We show that using every section of a set of 5 μm serial sections quantifies regional right ventricular fibrosis, with highly significant (p <; 0.001) differences between heart failure and control hearts. We show that the absolute error of collagen quantification is low when sections are taken spaced by up to 100 μm (error 5.7±5.8%). Likewise, absolute error associated with sectioning starting position is low for sections spaced up to 100 μm (error 13.3±17.2%). Above 100 μm section spacing quantification error is large (tending to 50%) and error associated with sectioning starting position is large (tending to 60%).	american heart association;approximation error;artificial cardiac pacemaker;fibrosis;heart failure, right-sided;heart failure;monocrotaline;quantitation;sampling (signal processing);sectioning technique;staining method;stains;structural integrity and failure	Stephen H.

Treatment of severe to profound, bilateral hearing loss often employs a multi-electrode cochlear implant inserted into the inner ear part of the temporal bone. CT scanners cannot resolve many important temporal bone details, especially bony anatomy. We improve the high-contrast spatial resolution of CT with blind deblurring of CT slices and test the improvement using a phantom test object. The improvement in visible detail or clinical scans is apparent subjectively and approaches 33% quantitatively.	anatomic structures;base of skull structure;bilateral filter;ct scan;clinical act of insertion;cochlear implant;deblurring;hearing loss, bilateral;labyrinth;numerous;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;temporal bone structure;visually impaired persons;hearing impairment	Ming Jiang;Ge Wang;Margaret W.

Because multiple detector rows are used for data acquisition, MCT offers higher volume coverage, faster scan speed, and reduced X-ray tube loading. Recognizing its unique data-sampling pattern, several image reconstruction algorithms were developed. These algorithms have been shown to be adequate in producing clinically acceptable images. Recent studies, however, have revealed that the image quality of MCT can be significantly degraded when helical data are acquired with a tilted gantry. The degraded image quality has rendered this feature unacceptable for clinical usage. In this paper, we first present a detailed investigation on the cause of the image quality degradation. An analytical model is derived to provide a mathematical basis for correction. Several compensation schemes are subsequently presented, and a detailed performance comparison is provided in terms of spatial resolution, noise, computation efficiency, and image artifacts.		J.

Many algorithms were published for metal artifact reduction (MAR) over the past decades with various degrees of success but without a perfect solution. Some MAR algorithms are based on the assumption that metal artifacts are due only to strong beam hardening and may fail in the case of serious photon starvation. Iterative methods handle photon starvation by discarding or underweighting corrupted data, but the results are not always stable and they come with high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a high-kVp-assisted CT scan mode combining a standard CT scan with a few projection views at a high-kVp value to obtain critical projection information near the metal parts. This method only requires minor hardware modifications on a modern CT scanner. Two MAR algorithms are proposed: dual-energy normalized MAR (DNMAR) and high-energy embedded MAR (HEMAR), aiming at situations without and with photon starvation respectively. Simulation results obtained with the CT simulator CatSim demonstrate that the proposed DNMAR and HEMAR methods can eliminate metal artifacts effectively.	algorithmic efficiency;computation;diagnostic radiologic examination;dual;dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry;embedded system;embedding;image quality;iterative method;metal-on-metal joint prostheses;morphologic artifacts;part dosing unit;patients;photons;scanner device component;scientific publication;simulation;x-ray computed tomography;algorithm	Yan Xi;Yannan Jin;Bruno De Man;Ge Wang	2016	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2602854	iterative reconstruction;image quality;computer vision;photonics;iterative method;computed tomography	EDA	45.84536934947581	-83.1354699732005	150642

Usually, the unknown parameters of the model are estimated, in any given region of interest (ROI), by least squares (LS). However, when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of PET data is too low, LS does not allow reliable parameter estimation. To overcome this problem, we study in this paper the applicability of approaches originally developed in the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic literature and referred to as """"population approaches"""". In particular, we consider the iterative two stage (ITS) method, which, given a set of M ROIs drawn on PET images of a given individual, estimates the unknown model parameters of each ROI by exploiting the information contained in all the M ROIs. After having revised the theory behind ITS, we assess its performance versus LS by using Monte Carlo simulations which allow us to evaluate the bias of the two methods in a variety of situations. Then, we compare the performance of LS and ITS in two case studies on [/sup 18/F]FDG kinetics in human skeletal muscle. Both simulated and real case studies results show that a population approach is of potential in modeling PET images since it allows to reliably estimate model parameters also in those ROIs where either a bad SNR or a poor sampling (e.g., infrequent scanning and/or short experiment duration) make the use of LS unsuccessful."""	ct scan;contain (action);estimated;estimation theory;iterative method;kinesiology;kinetics (discipline);least squares;monte carlo method;pharmacodynamics;polyethylene terephthalate;population parameter;positron-emission tomography;positrons;region of interest;revision procedure;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;skeletal muscle structure;stage ii bladder cancer	Alessandra Bertoldo;Giovanni Sparacino;Claudio Cobelli	2004	IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging	10.1109/TMI.2004.824243	computer simulation;econometrics;image analysis;simulation;computer science;mathematics;nuclear medicine;least squares;statistics;monte carlo method	Vision	50.092454924145805	-83.85044525341338	150879

We demonstrate the utility of this algorithm toward improving reproducibility of hippocampal definitions, using a dataset containing 4 MR images per subject, two within the same visit on each of two dates, with dense segmentations provided by unedited longitudinal Freesurfer analysis. We quantify reproducibility of intra-visit and inter-visit variability through L2 distances and Hausdorff distances between pairs of segmentations, and show that our method results in a statistically significant improvement by a factor of 1.63 to more than 3-fold.	computational anatomy;reduction (complexity)	Daniel Jacob Tward;Jorge Jovicich;Andrea Soricelli;Giovanni B.

f9793e09c7acc0b9c23b73508c32a53a0cc734d9	validation of automated ultrasound-ct registration of vertebrae		Image-guided spine surgery requires registration of the patient anatomy and preoperative computed tomography (CT) images. A technique for intraoperative ultrasound image registration to preoperative CT scans was developed and tested. Validation of the ultrasound-CT registration technique was performed using porcine cadavers. An ultrasound-CT registration technique was evaluated using 18 thoracic and lumbar vertebrae of 3 porcine cadavers with 10 different sweep patterns for ultrasound acquisition. For each sweep pattern at each vertebra, 100 randomly simulated initial misalignments were introduced. Each misalignment was registered. The resulting registration transformations were compared to gold standard registrations based on implanted fiducials to assess accuracy and robustness of the technique. The orthogonal-sweep acquisition was found to perform best and yielded a registration accuracy of 1.65 mm across all vertebrae on all porcine cadavers, where 82.5% of the registrations resulted in target registration errors below the 2 mm threshold recommended by a joint report from the experts in the field. In addition, we found that registration accuracy varies by the sweep pattern and vertebral level, but neighboring vertebrae tend to result in statistically similar accuracy. Ultrasound-CT registration took an average of 2.5 min to run, and the total registration time per vertebra (also including time for ultrasound acquisition and reconstruction) is approximately 8 min. A previously described ultrasound-CT registration technique yields clinically acceptable accuracy and robustness on multiple vertebrae across multiple porcine cadavers. The total registration time is shorter than that of surface point-based manual registration.	anatomic structures;bone structure of lumbar vertebra;bone structure of spine;ct scan;cadaver;chest;experiment;fiducial marker;ground truth;image registration;implants;maxima and minima;operative surgical procedures;patients;porcine species;randomness;scanning;simulation;spinal fusion (procedure);ultrasonography;cell transformation;registration - actclass	Charles Xiao Bo Yan;Benoît Goulet;Sean Jy-Shyang Chen;Donatella Tampieri;D.

To guarantee a geometrically coherent reconstruction, we propose a new way to register histological sections simuItaneously to previously acquired reference images and to neighboring slices in the stack. To this end, we formulate two potential functions and associate them to the same Markov random field through which we can efficiently find an optimal solution. Due to our simultaneous formulation and the absence of any segmentation step during the reconstruction we can dramatically reduce error propagation effects. This is illustrated by experiments on carefully created synthetic as well as real data sets.	algorithm;anatomic structures;coherence (physics);experiment;image analysis;input/output;markov chain;markov random field;medical image computing;morphologic artifacts;musculoskeletal diseases;propagation of uncertainty;software propagation;streaming media;synthetic data;undo;biologic segmentation;registration - actclass	Marco Feuerstein;Tim Hauke Heibel;José Gardiazabal;Nassir Navab;Martin Groher	2011	Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ...

Chronic constipation and diarrhea are regarded as two of the most common diseases affecting between 2% and 27% of the population in western countries. Defecatory disorders are most commonly due to dysfunction of the pelvic floor or the anal sphincter. Although an exact differentiation of these pathologies is essential for adequate therapy, diagnosis is still only based on a clinical evaluation. Regarding quantification of constipation only the ingestion of radio-opaque markers or radioactive isotopes and the consecutive assessment of colonic transit time using X-ray or scintigraphy, respectively, has been feasible in clinical settings. However, these approaches have several drawbacks such as involving rather inconvenient, time consuming examinations and exposing the patient to ionizing radiation. Therefore, conventional assessment of colonic transit time has not been widely used. Most recently a new technique for the assessment of colonic transit time using MRI and MR-contrast media filled capsules has been introduced. However, due to numerous examination dates per patient and corresponding datasets with many images, the evaluation of the image data is relatively time-consuming. The aim of our study was to develop a computer tool to facilitate the detection of the capsules in MRI datasets and thus to shorten the evaluation time. We present a semi-automatic tool which provides an intensity, size, and shape-based detection of ingested Gd-DTPA-saline filled capsules. After an automatic pre-classification, radiologists may easily correct the results using the application-specific user interface, therefore decreasing the evaluation time significantly.	approximation algorithm;comstock–needham system;gd-rom;radiology;salineos;scrolling;semiconductor industry;user interface;x-ray (amazon kindle)	Christian Harrer;Sonja Kirchhoff;Andreas Keil;Chlodwig Kirchhoff;Thomas Mussack;Andreas Lienemann;Maximilian Reiser;Nassir Navab	2008		10.1117/12.769867	opacity;radionuclide;magnetic resonance imaging;functional imaging;interface;ionizing radiation;user interface;physics	AI	36.565284656292675	-82.53981839434661	151526

The PROPELLER MRI method collects data from rectangular regions (blades) rotated around the origin of the k-space. Inter-blade patient motion is the premise for the use of super-resolution technique. Images obtained from sets of irregularly located frequency domain samples are combined into the high resolution MRI image. The super-resolution reconstruction replaces usually applied direct averaging of low-resolution images. Furthermore high order affine motion model has been applied.	image fusion;image resolution;iterative method;iterative reconstruction;super-resolution imaging;toeplitz hash algorithm	Krzysztof Malczewski;Ryszard Stasinski	2008	2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing	10.1109/ICIP.2008.4711761	computer vision;image resolution;computer science;magnetic resonance imaging;computer graphics (images)	Vision	48.89380752625483	-81.91261909005355	151634

The investigation and quantification of, e.g., the cardiac movement is important for assessment of cardiac abnormalities and to get an indication of response to therapy. In this paper we present a new aperture problem-free method to track cardiac motion from 2-dimensional MR tagged images and corresponding sine-phase images. Tracking is achieved by following the movement of scale-space critical points such as maxima, minima and saddles. Reconstruction of dense velocity field is carried out by minimizing an energy functional with regularization term influenced by covariant derivatives gauged by a prior assumption. MR tags deform along with the tissue, a combination of MR tagged images and sine-phase images was employed to produce a regular grid from which the scale-space critical points were retrieved. Experiments were carried out on real image data, and on artificial phantom data from which the ground truth is known. A comparison between our new method and a similar technique based on homogeneous diffusion regularization and standard derivatives shows increase in performance. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation emphasize the reliability of dense motion field allowing further analysis of deformation and torsion of the cardiac wall.	anisotropic diffusion;experiment;ground truth;image analysis;in-phase and quadrature components;matrix regularization;maxima and minima;medical image computing;medical imaging;motion estimation;motion field;optical flow;phantom reference;regular grid;scale space;torsion (gastropod);velocity (software development)	Alessandro Becciu;Bart J Janssen;Hans C. van Assen;Luc Florack;Vivian Roode;Bart M. ter Haar Romeny	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-03767-2_73	computer vision;two-dimensional space;vector field;scale space;simulation;motion perception;ground truth;computer science;motion estimation;mathematics;geometry;motion field;critical point	Vision	43.7910147677502	-82.78420102689108	151794

Using an MR-compatible loading device, a foot was scanned in a single neutral and seven dynamic positions including maximal flexion, rotation and inversion/eversion. A segmentation method combining graph cuts and level sets was developed which allows a user to interactively delineate 14 bones in the neutral position volume in less than 30 minutes total, including less than 10 mi nutes of user interaction. In the subsequent registration step, a separate rigid body transformation for each bone is obtained by registering the neutral position dataset to each of the dynamic ones, which produces an accurate description of the motion between them. We have processed six datasets, including 3 normal and 3 pathological feet. For validation our results were compared with those obtained from 3DViewnix, a semi-automatic segmentation program, and achieved good agreement in volume overlap ratios (mean: 91.57%, standard deviation: 3.58%) for all bones. Our tool requires only 1/50 and 1/150 of the user interaction time required by 3DViewnix and NIH Image Plus, respectively, an improvement that has the potential to make joint motion analysis from MRI pr actical in research and clinical applications.

A procedure for spatial model generation, based on digitized slice data, has been applied. A mathematical model and a 3-D computer simulation program have been implemented. Heat transfer in the non-homogenous tissue was modeled with a well known bio-heat equation. The heat production by tissue metabolism was modeled using the Q10 rule, while the heat exchange between the blood and tissue was modeled as a function of local temperature and regional blood flow. The stability and accuracy of the method was confirmed by varying the simulation parameters, the initial and boundary values, and the model dimensions, with subsequent analysis of the results. We have explained, by computer simulation, the variations in the Pennes' well-known in vivo measurements of the steady-state temperatures along the transverse axis of the proximal forearm. Suspecting that the anatomical positioning of his measuring probes varied, we have reconstructed their possible positions by searching for the simulated positions that result in the best agreement between simulated and measured temperature fields. Our simulations indicate that the fluctuations of the measured steady-state temperatures should not be smoothed out because they are the natural consequence of a complex interplay between the position of the measuring probes, anatomical position of the main arteries, dimensions of the forearm, blood flow, inhomogeneity of tissues, and environmental temperature.	anatomical position;arterial system;axis vertebra;body tissue;british informatics olympiad;computer simulation;dimensions;fever;forearm;mathematical model;optic axis of a crystal;q10;regional blood flow;rest;smoothing;steady state;thermogenesis;transverse wave;video-in video-out	Roman Trobec;Matjaz Depolli	2011	Computers in biology and medicine	10.1016/j.compbiomed.2011.08.006	computer simulation;heat exchanger;blood flow;mathematical model;heat equation;steady state;metabolism;heat transfer;surgery	Graphics	29.01790192736609	-85.65942814695208	152154

The proposed method predicts initial approximations for the iterative convergence calculations of the strong coupling method using the smoothing spline to remove errors from values of past timesteps and using the linear and second-order extrapolation. The new coupling algorithm was used for coupling a left ventricular finite element model to a myocardial excitation-contraction model. We performed experiments with different values for the smoothing parameter λ and with linear and second-order extrapolations. λ=1 with the linear extrapolation gave the best results. It reduced computation time by 91% compared to the strong coupling method. With the use of the smoothing spline, distance between the initial approximation and converged solution reduced by 62%, while the average number of iterations reduced by 32%. The smoothing spline can be used to improve the accuracy of predictors and reduce the number of iterations needed for the computation of the convergence procedure.	algorithm;approximation;computation (action);control theory;convergence (action);excitation;experiment;extrapolation;finite element method;iteration;iterative method;multiscale modeling;numerical method;polynomial;population parameter;simulation;smoothing (statistical technique);smoothing spline;time complexity;unstable medical device problem	Yuki Hasegawa;Takao Shimayoshi;Akira Amano;Tetsuya Matsuda	2011	2011 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6089913	computer simulation;spline;econometrics;mathematical optimization;smoothing spline;numerical analysis;finite element method;simulation modeling;mathematical model;mathematics;extrapolation;coupling;computational model;second-order logic;statistics	Robotics	30.693205741709658	-85.91829511917545	152516

Currently using a surgical robot can be challenging, fatiguing, and time consuming. Teaching the robot to actively assist surgical tasks, such as suturing, has the potential to vastly improve both patient outlook and the surgeon's efficiency. One obstacle to completing surgical sutures autonomously is the difficulty in tracking surgical suture threads. This paper proposes an algorithm which uses a Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) curve to model a suture thread. The NURBS model is initialized from a single selected point located on the thread. The NURBS curve is optimized by minimizing the image match energy between the projected stereo NURBS image and the segmented thread image. The algorithm is able to accurately track a suture thread as it translates, deforms, and changes length in real-time.	algorithm;fatigue;microsoft outlook for mac;minimally invasive surgical procedures;non-uniform rational b-spline;projections and predictions;real-time clock;remote control;robot;surgical sutures;benefit	Russell C.

The aim is to improve therapy planning for minimal invasive treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). Due to precise measurement of the abdominal aortic aneurysm and exact simulation of the bifurcated stent graft, physicians are supported in choosing a suitable stent prior to an intervention. The presented method can be used to measure the dimensions of the abdominal aortic aneurysm as well as simulate a bifurcated stent graft. Both of these procedures are based on a preceding segmentation and skeletonization of the aortic, right and left iliac. Using these centerlines (aortic, right and left iliac) a bifurcated initial stent is constructed. Through the implementation of an ACM method the initial stent is fit iteratively to the vessel walls – due to the influence of external forces (distanceas well as balloonforce). Following the fitting process, the crucial values for choosing a bifurcated stent graft are measured, e.g. aortic diameter, right and left common iliac diameter, minimum diameter of distal neck. The selected stent is then simulated to the CT-Data – starting with the initial stent. It hereby becomes apparent if the dimensions of the bifurcated stent graft are exact, i.e. the fitting to the arteries was done properly and no ostium was covered.	aaa (video game industry);computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis;grafting (decision trees);simulation	Jan Egger;Stefan Großkopf;Bernd Freisleben	2007		10.1117/12.709260	systems modeling;visualization;computer science	Robotics	38.67747371980543	-83.38017302568166	153090
2830f90a748de3627380de940e3986d9ef768336	high dynamic range displays and low vision		The variations in light energy we experience are huge. For example, the average luminance outdoors can be 100 million times greater during the day than at night. The luminance dynamic range at any moment can also be large, with contrasts on the order of 10,000:1 from highlights to shadows. Luminance levels can also change dramatically over time and from place to place. Vision functions over these variations through a variety of adaptation mechanisms, however vision is not equally good under all conditions. In particular, people with low vision (often the elderly and those with visual disorders), can be profoundly impaired by low intensity, high dynamic range, and rapidly changing luminance levels. Unfortunately, existing clinical vision tests are typically done at moderate, near-optimal levels and contrasts, and may therefore underestimate a person’s impairments. The need to develop more comprehensive and meaningful tests of vision and visual impairment under realistic illumination conditions has recently been articulated by both the National Eye Institute and the National Research Council, however, the limited output characteristics of standard display devices has been a significant impediment to progress. The emergence of high dynamic range (HDR) displays presents unique opportunities to develop new tools for vision research and testing and to advance our understanding of the effects of illumination on vision and visual impairment. This paper outlines some of these opportunities and describes some initial work to evaluate the use of HDR displays in this area. Introduction We experience huge variations in light energy in real-world environments. For example, the average luminance in sunlit scene can be 100 million times greater than the same scene lit by starlight. The instantaneous luminance dynamic range we experience at any moment can also be large, with ratios on the order of 10,000:1 from highlights to shadows, and even greater if light sources are visible. Luminance levels can also change over time and from place to place such as when the sun is obscured by clouds or we enter or leave a tunnel [IES93]. Human vision functions over these changes in illumination conditions through a variety of adaptation mechanisms that include the pupil, the duplex retina of rods and cones, photopigment bleaching, and neural gain controls [Shapley84]. Through the coordinated action of these mechanisms, vision functions over a luminance range of almost 14 log units. Figure 1 shows the range of light we encounter in natural scenes and summarizes some of the visual parameters associated with the different ranges. However, visual performance is not equally good under all luminance conditions. At high average (daylight/photopic) luminance levels visual functions such as acuity, contrast sensitivity, color discrimination, depth perception, and motion perception are near optimal. However under low luminance (mesopic/scotopic) conditions in twilight or at night, performance is substantially reduced [Hood86]. The instantaneous dynamic range of luminance in a scene can also have a significant impact on vision. For example, a bright light source in the visual field can cause light scattering in the eye, that can produce discomfort and veiling glare that can significantly reduce visual sensitivity and performance [Vos84]. Similarly, rapid temporal changes in the levels of illumination can also have a negative impact on vision. Nearly everyone has experienced the temporary blindness that occurs when entering a dark room from bright daylight or vice versa. Low Vision While these situations are minor annoyances for younger people with normal vision, the elderly and people with diseases of the visual system are often profoundly impaired by the variations in illumination they encounter in the world [Faye76, Mainster03]. A range of studies have shown that low luminance, high dynamic range, and rapidly changing illumination conditions can dramatically reduce visual performance in older people [Pitts82, Kline85] and in people with glaucoma [Glovinsky92], macular degeneration [Owsley01], retinitis pigmentosa [Jacobsen86], optic neuritis [Schneck93], diabetic retinopathy [Wolfe91], and other visual disorders. These losses in performance often translate into severe functional impairments in important tasks of daily living such as reading, mobility and driving, face recognition and social interaction, and the ability to use tools and appliances [NRC02]. Clinical Low Vision Testing Given the important effects that illumination conditions have on visual abilities and impairments, it is curious that standard clinical tests of vision are typically done under near ideal, photopic, glare-free conditions [NRC94]. There is converging evidence that these tests may not provide a sufficient picture of visual performance in the real world, often severely underestimating the impairments that people experience [Higgins00]. However, for a variety of reasons, advances in clinical vision testing have been slow in coming. Figure 1. Range of illumination in the environment and associated visual parameters. Adapted from [Hood86] ! Low luminance levels In the low luminance domain, testing is difficult in part because of the problem of producing calibrated and repeatable luminance levels. Although there is a large psychophysical literature on visual performance under scotopic and mesopic conditions [Hess90], most laboratory work has not typically included observers with low vision, and the instruments and tests have been custom-built. One researcher with a low vision focus modified a Humphrey automated perimeter to allow scotopic range contrast sensitivity testing of observers with macular degeneration [Owsley01], but this device is not commercially available. A lowtech approach for clinical low luminance testing is the SKILL acuity card [Haegerstrom-Portnoy97] that approximates low luminance, low contrast conditions at normal illumination levels with black letters on a gray background, however it has not been verified that performance under these conditions is the same as under actual low luminance conditions. Outside the laboratory, low luminance testing has largely been limited to measures of acuity and contrast sensitivity, so tests of other basic functions such as color discrimination, depth and motion perception, and visual search, and direct tests of performance on real-world visual tasks would be valuable. High contrast and glare Visual assessment under high dynamic range conditions typically falls under the rubric of glare testing [Elliot93]. A variety of instruments have been developed for testing basic visual functions such as high and low contrast visual acuity and contrast sensitivity in the presence of a glare source. These include the Miller-Nadler Glare Tester, the Brightness Acuity Tester (BAT), and the Berkeley Glare Test. A number of commercial devices have also been developed including the Vistech MCT8000, the Humphrey Model 570, the EyeCon 5, and the Opthimus glare test Unfortunately the geometries and luminance levels of the glare sources and targets differ from device to device, and in all, the glare source is located a different visual field location than the test target, which has made it difficult to develop a coherent picture of the effects that high dynamic range conditions have on visual performance. Changing luminance conditions Since aging and disorders of vision often affect the ability to adapt to changing luminance levels, dark adaptometry is a standard clinical tool. The traditional instrument is the Goldmann-Weekers dark adaptometer, though recently an LED-based device, the LKC Technologies Scotopic Sensitivity Tester became available. Low vision researchers have also modified a Humphrey automated perimeter to measure dark adaptation in patients with age-related macular degeneration [Owsley01] but the device is not commercially available. Typically the time course of recovery of contrast sensitivity is tested either with spot or grating targets. With respect to light adaptation one clinical testing protocol is known as “glare recovery” and involves the macular photostress test described by [Severin67] where a penlight is held close to the eye for several seconds and the time taken before pre-test acuity returns is used as a measure of adaptive function. Another line of testing involves calculation of the “transient adaptation factor” by measuring contrast sensitivity across the time course of early light adaptation (<1 sec) after the onset of a glare source [Higgins99]. As with testing in the low luminance and high dynamic range domains, testing protocols are variable, the range of functions tested is limited, and testing has largely been limited to observers with normal vision. HDR Displays and Low Vision Testing The need to develop more comprehensive and meaningful tests of vision and visual impairment under realistic illumination conditions has recently been articulated by both the National Eye Institute [NEI99] and the National Research Council [NRC02]. Modern electronic display systems and advanced computer graphics methods should in principle, allow the development of powerful new tools. However, the limited output levels and dynamic ranges of existing displays devices have been an impediment to progress. The emergence of HDR displays [Seetzen03,04] provides a unique opportunity to develop new tools for understanding the effects of varying luminance conditions on human visual performance and visual impairment. We are currently working on three related projects: First, we have constructed HDR displays and are evaluating their properties as visual stimulators [Ferwerda09, Zhang10]. On the basis of this work we are developing HDR display based tests that allow efficient, automatic assessment of the effects of absolute luminance level and dynamic range on standard measures of visual performance such as acuity, contrast sensitivi	a dark room;batch file;coherence (physics);computer graphics;dark web;daylight;depth perception;display device;duplex (telecommunications);emergence;facial recognition system;high dynamic range;luminance hdr;onset (audio);perimeter;rationalfunctionaltester;skill;watts humphrey	James A.

Specifically, gappy data sets are generated by removing nodal values from high-resolution 3-D CFD data (at random or in a fixed area) while noisy data sets are formed by superimposing speckle noise on the CFD results.

The results predict a monotonic relationship between block threshold and stimulation frequency for symmetric waveform and a non-monotonic relationship for non-symmetric waveforms. The symmetric waveform causes conduction block by constantly activating both sodium and potassium channels at frequencies of 20-300 kHz, while the non-symmetric waveforms share the same blocking mechanism from 20 kHz up to the peak threshold frequency. At the frequencies above the peak threshold frequency the non-symmetric waveforms block axonal conduction by either hyperpolarizing the membrane (if the positive pulse is longer) or depolarizing the membrane (if the negative pulse is longer). This simulation study further increases our understanding of conduction block in myelinated axons induced by high-frequency biphasic electrical stimulation, and can guide future animal experiments as well as optimize stimulation parameters that might be used for electrically induced nerve block in clinical applications.	atrioventricular block;axon;blocking (computing);deep brain stimulation;electric stimulation technique;electricity;experiment;functional electrical stimulation;heart block;huxley: the dystopia;kilohertz;myelin sheath;nerve block;non-monotonic logic;photoelectric effect;potassium;sodium;tissue membrane;waveform;simulation	Shouguo Zhao;Guangning Yang;Jicheng Wang;James R.

However, using this US measurement method to assess the median nerve CSA in diabetic patients with CTS has rarely been reported. Therefore, we used this US measurement method in this study to measure median nerve CSAs and to compare the CSAs of idiopathic, diabetic and diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) patients with CTS.   METHODS 124 hands belonging to 89 participants were included and assigned into four groups: control (32), idiopathic (38), diabetic (38) and DPN (16) CTS. In the latter two groups, only patients with mild and moderately severe CTS were included. The median nerve CSAs were measured at 8 points marked as i4, i3, i2, i1, w, o1, o2, and o3 in the inching test. The measured CSAs in each group of participants were compared.   RESULTS Compared with the CSAs of the control group, enlarged CSAs were found in the idiopathic, diabetic and DPN CTS groups. The CSAs were larger at i4, i3 and i2 in the diabetic CTS group compared to the idiopathic CTS group. The CSAs measured at the i1 and w levels of the DPN CTS group were smaller than those of the diabetic CTS group. In the diabetic CTS group, the cut-off values of CSAs measured at the inlet, wrist crease, and outlet were 15.3 mm2, 13.4 mm2 and 10.0 mm2, respectively, and 14.0 mm2, 12.5 mm2 and 10.5 mm2, respectively, in the DPN CTS group.   CONCLUSIONS Compared with the median nerve CSAs of the control and idiopathic CTS groups, the median nerve CSAs of the diabetic patients with CTS were significantly enlarged. However, compared with the diabetic CTS group, the CSAs were significantly smaller in the DPN CTS group. This US 8-point measurement method can be of value as an important complementary tool for CTS studies and diagnosis among diabetic patients."""	carpal tunnel syndrome;cross-sectional anatomy;cross-sectional data;cyclosporine;diabetes mellitus;diabetic neuropathies;diabetic polyneuropathies;eighty nine;enlargement procedure;idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis;image resolution;immune thrombocytopenic purpura;lambert-eaton myasthenic syndrome;large;medical ultrasound;nerve conduction function;nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nad);pnma2 gene;patients;personnameuse - assigned;polyneuropathy;small;structure of median nerve;x-ray microtomography;square millimeter (qualifier value)	Shu-Fang Chen;Chi-Ren Huang;Nai-Wen Tsai;Chiung-Chih Chang;Cheng-Hsien Lu;Yao-Chung Chuang;Wen-Neng Chang	2012		10.1186/1471-2342-12-15	risk assessment;radiology;medicine;pathology;prevalence;physical therapy;ultrasonography;severity of illness;risk factor;diabetes mellitus;surgery	HCI	31.727568262473966	-81.8223666126537	153968
ca1eef57abba7ae4dfc6ad6b84f8027bef51e32a	co-sparse analysis model based image registration to compensate brain shift by using intra-operative ultrasound imaging		Notwithstanding the widespread use of image guided neurosurgery systems in recent years, the accuracy of these systems is strongly limited by the intra-operative deformation of the brain tissue, the so-called brain shift. Intra-operative ultrasound (iUS) imaging as an effective solution to compensate complex brain shift phenomena update patients coordinate during surgery by registration of the intra-operative ultrasound and the pre-operative MRI data that is a challenging problem.In this work a non-rigid multimodal image registration technique based on co-sparse analysis model is proposed. This model captures the interdependency of two image modalities; MRI as an intensity image and iUS as a depth image. Based on this model, the transformation between the two modalities is minimized by using a bimodal pair of analysis operators which are learned by optimizing a joint co-sparsity function using a conjugate gradient.Experimental validation of our algorithm confirms that our registration approach outperforms several of other state-of-the-art registration methods quantitatively. The evaluation was performed using seven patient dataset with the mean registration error of only 1.83 mm. Our intensity-based co-sparse analysis model has improved the accuracy of non-rigid multimodal medical image registration by 15.37% compared to the curvelet based residual complexity as a powerful registration method, in a computational time compatible with clinical use.	algorithm;conjugate gradient method;curvelet;image registration;immunostimulating conjugate (antigen);interdependence;medical image;medical ultrasound;multimodal interaction;muscle rigidity;patients;science of neurosurgery;silo (dataset);sparse matrix;time complexity;ultrasonography;registration - actclass	Parastoo Farnia;E.

Most current algorithms use binning techniques which introduce artifacts that can seriously hamper quantitative motion analysis. In this paper, we develop an algorithm for tracking organ motion which uses raw time-stamped data and simultaneously reconstructs images and estimates deformations in anatomy. This results in a reduction of artifacts and an increase in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In the case of CT, the increased SNR enables a reduction in dose to the patient during scanning. This framework also facilitates the incorporation of fundamental physical properties of organ motion, such as the conservation of local tissue volume. We show in this paper that this approach is accurate and robust against noise and irregular breathing for tracking organ motion. A detailed phantom study is presented, demonstrating accuracy and robustness of the algorithm. An example of applying this algorithm to real patient image data is also presented, demonstrating the utility of the algorithm in reducing artifacts.	anatomic structures;ct scan;estimated;iterative reconstruction;morphologic artifacts;musculoskeletal diseases;patients;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;physical phenomenon or property;product binning;signal-to-noise ratio;x-ray computed tomography;algorithm	Jacob Hinkle;P.

In addition to a standard static clinical evaluation (anamnesis, radiological examination), the software provides a dynamic assessment of the shoulder joint by computing in real time the joint kinematics from a database of activities of daily living. During motion, the precise bone resection (location and amount) is computed based on detected subacromial impingements, providing surgeons with precise information about the surgical procedure. Moreover, to improve the subjective reading of medical images, the software provides 3D measurement tools based on anatomical models assisting in the analysis of shoulder morphological features. We performed an in vivo assessment of the software in a prospective randomized clinical study conducted with 27 patients beneficiating from the planning solution and a control group of 31 patients without planning. Postoperatively, patient’s pain decreased, and the shoulder range of motion and the functional outcomes improved significantly and the rotator cuff healing rate was good for both groups without intergroup differences. The amount of bone resected at surgery was comparable between the groups. The percentage of remaining impingement after surgery was in average reduced to 51% without groups difference. ArthroPlanner software includes all required materials (images data, 3D models, motion, morphological measurements, etc.) to improve orthopedists’ performance in the surgical planning of acromioplasty. The solution offers a perfect analysis of the patient’s anatomy and the ability to precisely analyze a dynamic mechanism to fully apprehend the patient’s condition and to fulfill his/her expectations.

However, the needle is visible in the US image, only when aligned in-plane with the scanning plane of the US probe. In practice, clinicians often use a mechanical needle guide, thus restricting their available degrees of freedom in the US probe movement. Alternatively, during free-hand procedure, they use multiple needle punctures to achieve this in-plane positioning. Our present work details an augmented reality (AR) system for patient comfort centric aid to needle intervention through an overlaid visualization of the needle trajectory on the US frame prior to its insertion. This is implemented by continuous visual tracking of the US probe and the needle in 3D world coordinate system using fiducial markers. The tracked marker positions are used to draw the needle trajectory and tip visualized in realtime to augment on the US feed. Subsequently, the continuously tracked US probe and needle, and the navigation assistance information, would be overlaid with the visual feed from a head mounted display (HMD) for generating totally immersive AR experience for the clinician.	augmented reality;fiducial marker;head-mounted display;video tracking	Praveen Kumar Kanithi;Jyotirmoy Chatterjee;Debdoot Sheet	2016		10.1145/3009977.3010023	computer vision;simulation;engineering;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	40.47161621178028	-85.25206112309172	154261

METHODS Gaze data and diagnostic decisions were collected from three breast imaging radiologists and three radiology residents who reviewed 20 screening mammograms while wearing a head-mounted eye-tracker. Image analysis was performed in mammographic regions that attracted radiologists' attention and in all abnormal regions. Machine learning algorithms were investigated to develop predictive models that link: (i) image content with gaze, (ii) image content and gaze with cognition, and (iii) image content, gaze, and cognition with diagnostic error. Both group-based and individualized models were explored.   RESULTS By pooling the data from all readers, machine learning produced highly accurate predictive models linking image content, gaze, and cognition. Potential linking of those with diagnostic error was also supported to some extent. Merging readers' gaze metrics and cognitive opinions with computer-extracted image features identified 59% of the readers' diagnostic errors while confirming 97.3% of their correct diagnoses. The readers' individual perceptual and cognitive behaviors could be adequately predicted by modeling the behavior of others. However, personalized tuning was in many cases beneficial for capturing more accurately individual behavior.   CONCLUSIONS There is clearly an interaction between radiologists' gaze, diagnostic decision, and image content which can be modeled with machine learning algorithms.	am broadcasting;algorithm;behavior;cognition disorders;data collection;decision support systems, clinical;decision support system;etoposide;extraction;eye tracking;fits;fifty nine;human error;image analysis;interpretation (logic);machine learning;manuscripts;medical image;medical imaging;peer review;personalization;predictive modelling;programming paradigm;radiology;review board;revision procedure;scientific publication;screening mammography;seizures;systemverilog;ut-vpn;virtual community;weka;world wide web;interest	Georgia D.

Free hand placement revealed a mean precision of cup anteversion and abduction of 10° and 3.5°, respectively. With the cup positioner, these angles measured 8° and 4° and using computer-assisted surgery, they decreased to 1.5° and 2.5°. This study demonstrates that computer-assisted surgery is clearly more precise than either of the two traditional methods, even for well-trained surgeons.		B. M. Jolles;P.

In this paper, the effect of key parameters on the lateral displacement estimation was investigated, in simulations and phantom experiments. The performance of the lateral estimator was evaluated by measuring its associated bias, jitter and correlation coefficient of radio-frequency (RF) signals. Simulation results showed that the bias, jitter and correlation coefficient undergo periodic variations depending on the lateral displacement, with a period equal to the pitch (i.e., adjacent element distance). The performance of the lateral estimation was improved, when a smaller pitch, or a larger beamwidth, was used. The results of the ph4antom experiments were shown to be in good agreement with the simulation findings, including the periodic variation of the performance with lateral displacement, effect of pitch and beamwidth. In conclusion, smaller pitch and wider beamwidth were found to be the key in reducing the jitter error in the lateral displacement estimation.	coefficient;computational human phantom;displacement mapping;elastography;experiment;lateral computing;lateral thinking;pitch (music);radio frequency;seasonality;simulation	Jianwen Luo;Elisa E.

The effect of focal stenosis on downstream flow pattern in the coronary arterial tree is not well understood. Here, the blood flows in normal and diseased porcine left anterior descending (LAD) arterial tree were modeled and compared to determine the effects of stenosis on the blood flow distribution and hemodynamic parameters. The anatomical model of LAD was extracted from a porcine heart by computed tomography (CT), which was comprised of a main trunk and nine side branches. Stenoses with various severities were imposed into the main trunk between the first and second side branches, and the boundary condition at each outlet accounted for the effect of stenosis on the flow rate in the downstream vasculature. It was found that only significant stenosis (≥75% area reduction) considerably altered pressure drop and total flow rate distribution in branches and at each bifurcation. The effect of significant stenosis on bifurcations, however, diminished at downstream locations. As demonstrated by distributions of oscillatory shear index and relative residence time, non-significant stenosis (<75% area reduction) has the potential to induce atherosclerosis near the ostium of downstream side branch, while significant stenosis can promote atherosclerosis in its wake.	anatomical orifice;anterior descending branch of left coronary artery;atherosclerosis;bifurcation theory;blood supply aspects;ct scan;cessation of life;downstream (software development);extraction;focal (programming language);flow;heart diseases;hemodynamics;image scaling;least absolute deviations;mathematical model;models, anatomic;muscle rigidity;numerical analysis;osi model;obstruction;pituitary gland, anterior;porcine species;simulation;steady state;stenosis (invertebrate);test scaling;x-ray computed tomography	Boyang Su;Yunlong Huo;Ghassan S.

As the number of coils increases, algorithms that reconstruct single combined image are more suitable for pMRI. Most single combined image reconstruction need explicit functions of coil sensitivity. As a result, estimation of the coil sensitivities is important in pMRI. Nowadays, ESPIRiT(Iterative self-consistent parallel imaging reconstruction using eigenvector maps) based on the estimation of coil sensitivities is an outstanding algorithm. However, ESPIRiT has its limitation, which estimates the coil sensitivities not very correctly, while the autocalibration data is insufficient. In this paper, we focus on the pMRI algorithms based on improving the estimation of coil sensitivities and propose a new algorithm called GESPIRiT (ESPIRiT combined with GRAPPA), which is based on combining ESPIRiT with GRAPPA to obtain better estimation of coil sensitivities and final reconstructed image. Experiments are applied to demonstrate its feasibility and efficiency.	algorithm;experiment;iterative reconstruction;map;resonance	Rihui Yang;Ran Yang;Guiying Huang	2014	2014 13th International Conference on Control Automation Robotics & Vision (ICARCV)	10.1109/ICARCV.2014.7064327	iterative reconstruction;mathematical optimization;estimation;electronic engineering;sensitivity;computer science;magnetic resonance imaging	Robotics	49.464929817614276	-81.60111822533587	154739

In this paper, an inverse design method is presented for the theoretical design of an ellipsoidal RF phased array coil for human breast MRI. The target field technique was used to analytically express the relationship between the current density and the magnetic field within a predefined region; the streamline function technique was subsequently utilized to find the coil winding patterns. Based on a spherical coordinate system, the method is extended from the conventional cylindrical shape to the more tailored ellipsoidal geometry, a linearly polarization field used as an example. The theoretical analysis and the preliminary results presented demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed method.	adobe streamline;breast cancer detection research;coil device component;flatulence;high-frequency ventilation;image quality;magnetic fields;magnetic resonance imaging;mammary neoplasms;phased array;polarization (waves);radio frequency	Yu Li;Feng Liu;Ewald Weber;Mingyan Li;Wenlong Xu;Stuart Crozier	2011	2011 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6090099	electronic engineering;radiology;medicine;design methods;engineering;magnetic resonance imaging;biological engineering;nuclear magnetic resonance;physics	Robotics	48.287085624387785	-83.97103671123014	154984

Tremendous increase in internet bandwidth has enabled a true revolution in image transmission and easy remote viewing of the static images and real-time video stream. Previous reports of real-time telesonography, such as the ones developed for emergency situations and humanitarian work, rely on high compressions of images utilized by remote sonologist to guide and supervise the unexperienced examiner. We believe that remote sonology could be also utilized in teleultrasound exam of infant hip. We tested feasibility of a low-cost teleultrasound system for infant hip and performed data analysis on the transmitted and original images. Transmission of data was accomplished with Remote Ultrasound (RU), a software package specifically designed for teleultrasound transmission through limited internet bandwidth. While image analysis of image pairs revealed statistically significant loss of information, panel evaluation failed to recognize any clinical difference between the original saved and transmitted still images.	akr1c1 wt allele;biological evolution;compression;decisional diffie–hellman assumption;elegant degradation;image analysis;image quality;internet;interrupt;medical specialities;medical ultrasound;open-source software;radiology;random-access memory;real-time clock;real-time transcription;streaming media;tv tuner card;tuner device component;usb;ultrasonography;video card;video clip;disease transmission;transmission process	Dobrivoje Martinov;Veljko Popov;Zoran Ignjatov;Robert D.

e9556a3b2512bf389438c540837cc0f0ab4508e8	the production of digital and printed resources from multiple modalities using visualization and three-dimensional printing techniques	3d printing;anatomical organs;medical images;medical reconstruction;visualization	Virtual digital resources and printed models have become indispensable tools for medical training and surgical planning. Nevertheless, printed models of soft tissue organs are still challenging to reproduce. This study adopts open source packages and a low-cost desktop 3D printer to convert multiple modalities of medical images to digital resources (volume rendering images and digital models) and lifelike printed models, which are useful to enhance our understanding of the geometric structure and complex spatial nature of anatomical organs. Neuroimaging technologies such as CT, CTA, MRI, and TOF-MRA collect serial medical images. The procedures for producing digital resources can be divided into volume rendering and medical image reconstruction. To verify the accuracy of reconstruction, this study presents qualitative and quantitative assessments. Subsequently, digital models are archived as stereolithography format files and imported to the bundled software of the 3D printer. The printed models are produced using polylactide filament materials. We have successfully converted multiple modalities of medical images to digital resources and printed models for both hard organs (cranial base and tooth) and soft tissue organs (brain, blood vessels of the brain, the heart chambers and vessel lumen, and pituitary tumor). Multiple digital resources and printed models were provided to illustrate the anatomical relationship between organs and complicated surrounding structures. Three-dimensional printing (3DP) is a powerful tool to produce lifelike and tangible models. We present an available and cost-effective method for producing both digital resources and printed models. The choice of modality in medical images and the processing approach is important when reproducing soft tissue organs models. The accuracy of the printed model is determined by the quality of organ models and 3DP. With the ongoing improvement of printing techniques and the variety of materials available, 3DP will become an indispensable tool in medical training and surgical planning.	3d printing;archive;base of skull structure;blood vessel tissue;cardiac chamber structure;comparison of 3d printers;consent forms;cytoskeletal filaments;declaration (computer programming);desktop computer;effective method;entity–relationship model;evaluation procedure;fused filament fabrication;guardian previously informed of patient condition:finding:point in time:guardian:ordinal:observed;heap feng shui;imagery;iterative reconstruction;lindera sp. zhou 200491;medical image;modality (human–computer interaction);monotropa uniflora;myrrh extract;natural science disciplines;neuroimaging;odontogenic tissue;open-source software;organ;patients;pituitary neoplasms;polyarteritis nodosa;printer (computing);printer device component;printing, three-dimensional;puromycin aminonucleoside;school;shi pi yin herbal decoction;structure of lumen of body system;volume rendering;yao graph;interest;poly(lactide);soft tissue;standards characteristics	Wuyang Shui;Mingquan Zhou;Shi Chen;Zhouxian Pan;Qingqiong Deng;Yong Yao;Hui Pan;Taiping He;Xingce Wang	2016	International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery	10.1007/s11548-016-1461-9	computer vision;multimedia	HCI	37.42752842844854	-85.80636208259135	155396

Four standard amorphous silicon photodiode-TFT (thin film transistor) arrays are cut parallel to the busbars, in the space between the bus-bar and the preceding pixel electrode. The cut is done in such a may that it is adjacent to the pixel electrode on the active plate. The four subarrays are then rotated by 90/spl deg/, with respect to their neighbors, and butted together. In this way, the seam between each tile has no adjacent bus-bar, and it is possible to reproduce the pixel pitch between neighboring tiles, with an acceptable alignment tolerance of the tiles. The authors have demonstrated the feasibility of the method, with the aid of a small prototype, based on a 192/spl times/192 pixel array, with a 200-/spl mu/m pitch. Some image processing is necessary to rotate the images back for display on a conventional display monitor. This can cause artefacts, in some fast moving scenes, in which case an alternative scheme, which uses two mirror image arrays, each rotated by 180/spl deg/, can be used. However, for static X-ray images and most images in dynamic medical X-ray applications this is not necessary and one can obtain good quality seamless images, free from any significant artefacts.	computer monitor;diagnostic radiologic examination;dot pitch;image processing;image sensor;morphologic artifacts;pitch (music);pixel;prototype;radiography;seamless3d;silicon;thin-film transistor;thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display;tiling window manager;transistor device component;sensor (device)	M.

Application of the latter results in higher-frequency contents of EMG. In the field of impact biomechanics, surface electrodes are more often utilized than fine-wire ones. However, the removal of motion artefacts from EMG recorded under transient loads requires application of high-pass filters with relatively high cutoff frequencies, which may eliminate a significant part of the surface EMG power spectra. Therefore, in the current study, both surface and fine-wire electrodes were utilized to record the EMG of cervical muscles under conditions simulating a rear-end car collision at low speed. The results indicated that application of high-pass filtering at 50 Hz can be necessary to remove motion artefacts from the EMG collected under such conditions. Such filtering resulted in a higher decrease in amplitude of the surface EMG than that of the fine-wire one. However, the reflex times obtained here were not significantly affected by the type of the electrodes utilized to collect EMG.	electromyography;low-pass filter;simulation	Adam Wittek;Koshiro Ono;Janusz Kajzer;Roland Örtengren;Satoshi Inami	2001	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/10.909635	filter;mental chronometry;kinematics;electronic engineering;muscle;simulation;index term;electrodiagnosis;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;electrode;biomechanics;comparative research;signal processing;cutoff frequency;fourier analysis;high-pass filter;utility frequency;physics	Visualization	24.834354859221342	-85.62305403737538	155718

This paper explores the CC abnormalities in autism. The CC is segmented from 2D MRIs using our newly developed semiautomatic method, and a subsequent contour stitching is performed to create the 3D surface of the CC. After alignment, differences between autistic patients and the control group are computed using Hotelling T2 two-sample metric, which results in a raw significance map. Permutation test is performed to generate a corrected significance map. The statistical results reveal significant difference between patients and controls in the body of the CC.

We hypothesize that the direction of wave propagation on the epicardial surface is not aligned with the epicardial fiber orientation, due to intramural fiber rotation. In this paper, we modeled the effect of cardiac tissue fiber rotation on wave propagation. We used a three dimensional computer model of varying thickness with a 120 degree fiber rotation through the thickness. The angle difference between the direction of propagation and fiber orientation was most pronounced for thin tissue, and decreased with increasing tissue thickness. This angle also increased with the time elapsed since stimulation. Finally, we demonstrated that the fiber rotation from epicardium to endocardium results in inaccurate measurements of conduction velocities at the epicardium, particularly in thin tissues.	alignment;body tissue;computer simulation;distortion;endocardium;epicardium;experiment;fiber to the x;numerical weather prediction;propagation of uncertainty;software propagation;thickness (graph theory);tissue fiber	A.

Accurate and automatic detection of spinal portion with spondylolisthesis problem willnsignificantly reduce the manual work of physician and provide a more robust evaluation for the spine condition.nMost existing automatic identification methods adopted the indirect approach which used vertebrae locations to measurenthe spondylolisthesis. However, these methods relied heavily on automatic vertebra detection which often suffered fromnthe pool spatial accuracy and the lack of validated pathological training samples. In this study, we present a novelnspondylolisthesis detection method which can directly locate the irregular spine portion and output the correspondingngrading. The detection is done by a set of learning-based detectors which are discriminatively trained by synthesizednspondylolisthesis image samples. To provide sufficient pathological training samples, we used a parameterized spinenmodel to synthesize different types of spondylolysis images from real MR/CT scans. The parameterized model cannautomatically locate the vertebrae in spine images and estimate their pose orientations, and can inversely alter thenvertebrae locations and poses by changing the corresponding parameters. Various training samples can then be generatednfrom only a few spine MR/CT images. The preliminary results suggest great potential for the fast and efficientnspondylolisthesis identification and measurement in both MR and CT spine images.	sensor	Yunliang Cai;Stephanie Leung;James Warrington;Sachin Pandey;Olga Shmuilovich;Shuo Li	2017		10.1117/12.2254072	spine;sensor	Metrics	37.975739292519776	-80.97351699836167	156127

Recently, acquisition of orthogonal anisotropic acquisitions and super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) of the underlying high-resolution image has been proposed to achieve higher resolution. Promising results have been shown with simulations. However, practical evidence that SRR enables resolution enhancement remains unclear. Particularly, real DWI scans acquired in orthogonal directions are subject to very different distortion. This makes the precise alignment of the images impossible and strongly perturbs the reconstruction. In this work we propose to combine distortion compensation and SRR. Distortion compensation is achieved by acquisition of a dual echo field map, providing an estimate of the field inhomogeneity. The SRR is formulated as a maximum a posteriori problem and relies on a realistic image generation model. We evaluate our approach with real anisotropic acquisitions. Importantly, we demonstrate that combining distortion compensation and SRR provides better results than acquisition of a single isotropic scan for the same acquisition duration time. The SRR provides more detailed structures and better tractography results. This work provides the first evidence that SRR, which employs conventional SS-EPI techniques, may enable resolution enhancement in DWI, and may dramatically impact the way to achieve DW imaging in both neuroscience and clinical applications.	alignment;anisotropic diffusion;diffusion weighted imaging;distortion;dreamwidth;dual;glossary of computer graphics;image resolution;linear programming relaxation;magnetic resonance imaging;neuroscience discipline;perturbation theory (quantum mechanics);simpl;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;super-resolution imaging	Benoit Scherrer;Ali Gholipour;Simon K.

An analytic volume conductor model was used to determine the voltage waveform at a distance of 5mm from a point current stimulus for 17 different biological tissues. The RMS error of the voltage waveform resulting from the incorporation of a subset of all poles with respect to the voltage waveform resulting from the incorporation of the complete set of dispersive poles was calculated. The stimulus amplitude necessary to elicit action potential propagation in a myelinated mammalian nerve fibre in each of the dispersive models was also determined using a multi-compartment cable axon model. It was found that, for all tissues, removal of dispersions with pole frequencies greater than 1MHz had a negligible effect on the threshold stimulation amplitude, suggesting that they may be neglected when constructing volume conductor models of electrical stimulation. However, removal of low-frequency dispersions below 1MHz resulted in greater reductions in the threshold stimulus amplitudes necessary for activation of axons, with errors of up to 86% observed.	action potential;anatomical compartments;axon;body tissue;dispersive partial differential equation;electric stimulation technique;electroconvulsive therapy;functional electrical stimulation;high-κ dielectric;implants;mammals;multi-compartment model;myelin sheath;nerve fibers;numerous;root mean square;software propagation;subgroup;waveform;voltage	Peadar F.

On the other hand, we know that 3D image reconstruction based on three-orthogonal circular isocentric orbits is sufficient in the sense of Tuy data sufficiency condition. Therefore the datum obtained from three-orthogonal circular isocentric orbits can derive an exact reconstruction algorithm. In this paper, an exact weighted-FBP algorithm with three-orthogonal circular isocentric orbits is derived by means of Katsevich's equations of filtering lines based on a circle trajectory and a modified weighted form of Tuy's reconstruction scheme.	algorithm;flow-based programming;geodetic datum;image fusion;iterative reconstruction;ocular orbit;radionuclide imaging	Hongli Hu;Jianzhou Zhang	2009		10.3390/s90604606	weight function;telecommunications;bioinformatics;engineering;electrical engineering;data mining;optics;operations research;statistics	Vision	48.384582636021996	-85.07105220731253	156321

Two indenters compress the breast from different directions to generate sufficient strain on the inner tumor, which simply represents clinical dynamic testing. The nonlinear elasticity of the inner tumor is estimated by correcting the reaction force data of the surrounding soft tissue. Here, we present the basic concept of our study and simulation results considering geometric conditions of the indenters using a finite element breast model. Indenters with variable width are applied to the breast at several contact positions in a simulation for comparison. Our results indicate that when the spring stiffness between the contact position of one indenter and the center of the tumor equals the spring stiffness between the contact position of the other indenter and the center of the tumor, a larger contact area (i.e., larger spring stiffness) provides larger strain acting on the inner tumor.	compresses (device);dynamic testing;elasticity (cloud computing);elasticity (data store);experiment;finite element method;in vitro [publication type];large;mammary neoplasms;nonlinear system;palpation;robot;simulation;stiffness;soft tissue;width	Mariko Tsukune;Maya Hatano;Yo Kobayashi;Tomoyuki Miyashita;M.
