These numbers are called the projections. We are interested in the problem of reconstructing a tiling which has given projections. Some simple variants of this problem, involving tiles that are 1 × 1 or 1 × 2 rectangles, have been studied in the past, and were proved to be either solvable in polynomial time or NP-complete. In this note, we make progress toward a comprehensive classi7cation of various tiling reconstruction problems, by proving NP-completeness results for several sets of tiles. c © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

c780f98e1893769b474f1fd652fd2dc27529a8c5	when is the matching polytope box-totally dual integral?	pg_thesis	Let G = (V,E) be a graph. The matching polytope of G, denoted by P (G), is the convex hull of the incidence vectors of all matchings in G. As proved by Edmonds in 1965, P (G) is determined by the following linear system π(G): • x(e) ≥ 0 for each e ∈ E; • x(δ(v)) ≤ 1 for each v ∈ V ; • x(E[U ]) ≤ ⌊ 12 |U |⌋ for each U ⊆ V with |U | odd. In 1978, Cunningham and Marsh strengthened this theorem by showing that π(G) is always totally dual integral. In 1984, Edmonds and Giles initiated the study of graphs G for which π(G) is box-totally dual integral. In this paper we present a structural characterization of all such graphs, and develop a general and powerful method for establishing box-total dual integrality. MSC 2000 subject classification.

Moreover, two analogous characterizations for edge-deleted median graphs are given. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We present a much simpler algorithm which uses a related, but much more informative tree representation of interval graphs.

In 1950, Foulkes observed that they have some stability properties: certain sequences of plethysm coefficients are eventually constant. Such stability properties were proven by Brion with geometric techniques, and by Thibon and Carré by means of vertex operators. In this paper we present a new approach to prove such stability properties. Our proofs are purely combinatorial and follow the same scheme. We decompose plethysm coefficients in terms of other plethysm coefficients related to the complete homogeneous basis of symmetric functions.We show that these other plethysm coefficients count integer points in polytopes and we prove stability for them by exhibiting bijections between the corresponding sets of integer points of each polytope. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Specializing the LU factorization in this fashion poses a challenge as the embedded network algorithm uses a very compressed working basis inverse. Using publicly available test problems, we demonstrate the impact of this factorization on the EMNET implementation of the embedded network simplex algorithm. We also compare the impact of the LU factorization when coupled with recent advances in starting, pricing, and basis reduction that have already been implemented in EMNET. We demonstrate that this LU factorization is a vital component of EMNET and offers significant performance improvement for virtually all EMNET configurations. To place our results in context, we compare EMNET's performance with CPLEX.	analysis of algorithms;cplex;code;data structure;fo (complexity);flow network;general-purpose modeling;heuristic;lu decomposition;mathematical optimization;network simplex algorithm;preprocessor;qr decomposition;revised simplex method;solver;sparse matrix	Richard D.

09dc4f30176ca6c4d6b003c21c87551c220adf79	reconstruction of weakly simple polygons from their edges		Given $n$ line segments in the plane, do they form the edge set of a \emph{weakly simple polygon}; that is, can the segment endpoints be perturbed by at most $\varepsilon$, for any $\varepsilon>0$, to obtain a simple polygon? While the analogous question for \emph{simple polygons} can easily be answered in $O(n\log n)$ time, we show that it is NP-complete for weakly simple polygons. We give $O(n)$-time algorithms in two special cases: when all segments are collinear, or the segment endpoints are in general position. These results extend to the variant in which the segments are \emph{directed}, and the counterclockwise traversal of a polygon should follow the orientation. We study related problems for the case that the union of the $n$ input segments is connected. (i) If each segment can be subdivided into several segments, find the minimum number of subdivision points to form a weakly simple polygon. (ii) If new line segments can be added, find the minimum total length of new segments that creates a weakly simple polygon. We give worst-case upper and lower bounds for both problems.	algorithm;best, worst and average case;computation;karp's 21 np-complete problems;subdivision surface;tree traversal	Hugo A.

We prove that for a subgraph containing a cycle, the threshold for its appearance in the trace of a random walk of length m is essentially equal to the threshold for its appearance in the random graph drawn from G(n,m).

(new propositions for the exact solution of the unidimensional multi-criteria knapsack problem with binary variables)		The purpose of this work is the exact solution of a problem from the field of multi-criteria combinatorial optimisation. Our goal his twofold. First, we aim at confirming the efficien y of the so-named two-phases algorithms. Then, we set a generalisation of the branch and b ou procedures, popular in the mono-criteria case but almost non-existent in the multi-criteria case. Our work is based on the unidimensional multi-criteria knapsack problem with binary variables, a class i from combinatorial optimisation, found as a sub problem in many optimisation problems. The first part concerns the reduction of the instances of the problem. We expose several properties allowing to a priori find some parts of the structure of all efficient solutions. Then, we descr ibe an efficient two-phases procedure for this problem. Initially in the bi-criter ia case, we improve the original procedure from Viséet al. (1998) before defining a new procedure to efficiently find the solutions in the second phase. This algorithm is extended to the triand multi-crite r a case in the next part. Finally, the generalisation of the branch and bound procedure is the last part of our work. We focus on several difficulties, to which we answer with two new procedure s. Numerical experiments show that these procedures can solve instances in acceptable time. Never thel ss, the two-phases algorithms outperform these procedures, just like the best known proce dures for this problem.	algorithm;branch and bound;combinatorial optimization;experiment;knapsack problem;linear algebra;mathematical optimization;numerical method	Julien Jorge	2010				Theory	25.00694254846536	9.318664919674118	14953

f4380494e946e562814dc4b9332ecca888080f2d	a posteriori distributions and detection theory		The notion of a posteriori probability, often used in hypothesis testing in connection with problems of optimum signal detection, is put on a firm basis. The number of hypotheses is countable, and the observation space ω is abstract so as to include the case where the observation is a realization of a continuous parameter random process. The a posteriori probability is defined without recourse to limiting arguments on “finite dimensional≓ conditional probabilities. The existence of the a posteriori probability is established, its a.e. uniqueness is studied, and it is then used to define other a posteriori quantities and to solve the decision problem of minimizing the error probability. In particular, a precise version of the loose assertion that “minimizing the error probability is equivalent to maximizing the a posteriori probability≓ is stated and proved. The results are then applied to the case where the observation is a sample path of a random process, devoting considerable attention to questions of convergence and of having satisfactory models for the observation space, the random process, and the observables. The deficiencies of a common function space type model are pointed out and ways of correcting these deficiencies are discussed. The use of time samples and Karhunen-Loeve expansion coefficients as observables is investigated. The paper closes with an examination of non function space type models, and a demonstration that function space type models are, in a sense, natural models for detection problems.	detection theory	Behram H.

If fis a nonintegral MDF of a tree, the existence of another MDF with fewer nonintegral values and other desirable properties is established.

Further, results concerning the convexity graph of the MDFs of a tree (a graph which exhibits the essential properties of the relation W) are obtained.	essence;graph (discrete mathematics);media descriptor file	Ernest J.

In this paper, we propose the discretized VC dimension obtained by discretizing the range of a real function class. Then, we point out that Sauer’s Lemma is valid for the discretized VC dimension. We group the real function classes having the infinite VC dimension into four categories by using the discretized VC dimension. As a byproduct, we present the equidistantly discretized VC dimension by introducing an equidistant partition to segmenting the range of a real function class. Finally, we obtain the error bounds for real function classes based on the discretized VC dimensions in the PAC-learning framework.	alexey chervonenkis;discretization;machine learning;probably approximately correct learning;statistical learning theory;vc dimension	Chao Zhang;Dacheng Tao	2010	Austr.

25d16fe01048986bdaace511e773b11f25c1d78a	a new convergence rate estimation of general artificial immune algorithm		Artificial immune algorithm has been used widely and successfully in many computational optimization areas, but the theoretical research exploring the convergence rate characteristics of artificial immune algorithm is yet inadequate. In this paper, instead of the traditional eigenvalue estimation of state transition matrix, stochastic processes theory is introduced to study the convergence rate of general artificial immune algorithm. The method begins by analyzing the necessary condition for convergence of artificial immune algorithm and takes it as the sufficient condition for a class of general artificial immune algorithm. Through the definition of Markov chain convergence rate, a probability strong convergence rate estimation method of general artificial immune algorithm is proposed. This method is judged by the final convergence of the best antibody, which overcomes the conservative defect of traditional estimation methods. The simulation results show the correctness of the proposed estimation method, and the estimation method can be used to judge the convergence and convergence rate of a class of artificial immune algorithms. This research has a certain theoretical reference value to optimize the convergence rate in the practical application of artificial immune algorithm.	algorithm;computation;computational complexity theory;correctness (computer science);markov chain;mathematical optimization;rate of convergence;simulation;software bug;state transition table;stochastic matrix;stochastic process	Lu Hong;Joarder Kamruzzaman	2015	Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems	10.3233/IFS-151559	econometrics;mathematical optimization;machine learning	ML	43.124120962064545	4.91581159378509	15176

This article presents a degradation model for highly reliable light displays, such as plasma display panels (PDPs) or vacuum fluorescent displays (VFDs). Standard degradation models fail to capture the burn-in characteristics of VFDs, when emitted light actually increases up to a certain point in time before it decreases (or degrades) continuously. Random coefficients are used to model this phenomenon in a nonlinear way which allows for a nonmonotonic degradation path. In many situations, the relative efficiency of the lifetime estimate is improved over the standard estimators based on transformed linear models.	burn-in;coefficient;control theory;display device;elegant degradation;ibm notes;linear model;nonlinear system;plasma display;simulation;vacuum fluorescent display	Suk Joo Bae;Paul H.

86f0048b70b078bc6fa58f25a29f84224d8a939a	indiscernible sequences for extenders, and the singular cardinal hypothesis	lower bound	We prove several results giving lower bounds for the large cardinal strength of a failure of the singular cardinal hypothesis. The main result is the following theorem: Theorem. Suppose κ is a singular strong limit cardinal and 2 ≥ λ where λ is not the successor of a cardinal of cofinality at most κ. If cf(κ) > ω then it follows that o(κ) ≥ λ, and if cf(κ) = ω then either o(κ) ≥ λ or {α : K |= o(α) ≥ α+n } is cofinal in κ for each n ∈ ω. We also prove several results which extend or are related to this result, notably Theorem. If 2 < אω and 2 אω > אω1 then there is a sharp for a model with a strong cardinal. In order to prove these theorems we give a detailed analysis of the sequences of indiscernibles which come from applying the covering lemma to nonoverlapping sequences of extenders. Some of the results were obtained while Gitik was visiting Los Angeles in Fall 1991. He would like to thank A. Kechris, D. Martin and J. Steel for their hospitality.

Two versions (weak and strong) of the notion of a symmetrical dilation are introduced, and they are applied to the generation of “connected components” from the so-called “geodesic dilations”. It turns out that any “climbing” “weakly symmetrical” extensive dilation induces a “geodesic” connectivity. When the lattice is the one of subsets of a metric space, the connectivities which are obtained in this way may coincide with the usual ones under some conditions, which are clarified. The abstract theory can be applied to grey-level and colour images, without any assumption of translation-invariance of operators.	connected component (graph theory);dilation (morphology)	Christian Ronse;Jean Paul Frédéric Serra	2001	Fundam.

Using the dynamic cavity method on time trajectories, we construct a general procedure for deriving the dynamic message-passing equations for a large class of models with unidirectional dynamics, which includes the zero-temperature random-field Ising model, the susceptible-infected-recovered model, and rumor spreading models. We show that unidirectionality of the dynamics is the key ingredient that makes the problem solvable. These equations are applicable to single instances of the corresponding problems with arbitrary initial conditions and are asymptotically exact for problems defined on locally treelike graphs. When applied to real-world networks, they generically provide a good analytic approximation of the real dynamics.	approximation;arabic numeral 0;body cavities;decision problem;graph - visual representation;initial condition;ising model;message passing;single-instance storage	Andrey Y.

We look for a cut that is small in two senses, i.e., there are no more than $k$ vertices in $X$ and no more than $t$ edges leaving $X$. Answering a question asked by Fomin et al. (arXiv:1304.6189), we show the problem is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by either $k$ or $t$.	cobham's thesis;parameterized complexity;vertex (graph theory)	Yixin Cao	2013	CoRR		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;mathematics	NLP	28.145316953508917	24.552637044662834	15231

Although combinatorial methods, which return a provably optimal integral solution of the problem, made a significant progress in the past decade, they are still typically unable to cope with large-scale datasets. On the other hand, large scale datasets are often defined on sparse graphs and convex relaxation methods, such as linear programming relaxations then provide good approximations to integral solutions. We propose a novel method of combining combinatorial and convex programming techniques to obtain a global solution of the initial combinatorial problem. Based on the information obtained from the solution of the convex relaxation, our method confines application of the combinatorial solver to a small fraction of the initial graphical model, which allows to optimally solve much larger problems. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a computer vision energy minimization benchmark.	algorithm;approximation;benchmark (computing);combinatorial search;computer vision;convex optimization;energy minimization;global optimization;graph (discrete mathematics);graphical model;image analysis;linear programming relaxation;machine perception;markov chain;markov random field;mathematical optimization;solver;sparse matrix	Bogdan Savchynskyy;Jörg H.

Thus, we pose the following question: Is it possible to achieve a regret bound for online logistic regression that is O(poly(D) log(T ))?

Such problems are not only nonsmooth, barring naive convexified sparse recovery approaches, but also are NP-Hard in general. To handle the non-smoothness, we provide a saddle-point reformulation of the e-CS problem, and propose a novel approximation scheme, called the game-theoretic approximate matching estimator (GAME) algorithm. We then show that the restricted isometry property of expander matrices in the ℓ1-norm circumvents the intractability of e-CS in the worst case. GAME therefore finds a sparse approximation x̂ to optimal solution such that equation. We also propose a convex optimization approach to e-CS based on Nesterov smoothing, and discuss its (dis)advantages.	adjacency matrix;approximation algorithm;approximation error;best, worst and average case;closing (morphology);compressed sensing;convex optimization;game theory;iteration;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;np-hardness;regular expression;restricted isometry property;scalability;smoothing;sparse approximation;sparse matrix;taxicab geometry	Sina Jafarpour;Volkan Cevher;Robert E.

A frequency domain representation for graph signals can be defined using the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of variation operators that take into account the underlying graph connectivity. Smoothly varying signals defined on the nodes are of particular interest in various applications, and tend to be approximately bandlimited in the frequency basis. Sampling theory for graph signals deals with the problem of choosing the best subset of nodes for reconstructing a bandlimited signal from its samples. Most approaches to this problem require a computation of the frequency basis (i.e., the eigenvectors of the variation operator), followed by a search procedure using the basis elements. This can be impractical, in terms of storage and time complexity, for real datasets involving very large graphs. We circumvent this issue in our formulation by introducing quantities called graph spectral proxies, defined using the powers of the variation operator, in order to approximate the spectral content of graph signals. This allows us to formulate a direct sampling set selection approach that does not require the computation and storage of the basis elements. We show that our approach also provides stable reconstruction when the samples are noisy or when the original signal is only approximately bandlimited. Furthermore, the proposed approach is valid for any choice of the variation operator, thereby covering a wide range of graphs and applications. We demonstrate its effectiveness through various numerical experiments.	adaptive sampling;approximation algorithm;bandlimiting;bandwidth (signal processing);batch processing;computation;connectivity (graph theory);convex function;directed graph;effective method;expanded memory;experiment;greedy algorithm;hp 48 series;jensen's inequality;numerical analysis;p (complexity);polynomial;proxy server;sampling (signal processing);signal reconstruction;smoothing;social inequality;time complexity;vergence	Aamir Anis;Akshay Gadde;Antonio Ortega	2016	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2016.2546233	iterative reconstruction;graph energy;integral graph;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;graph bandwidth;noise measurement;mathematics;approximation algorithm;bandwidth;adjacency matrix;statistics	ML	53.417334368877206	19.095826396028976	15582

However, their success means that the largest space requirement encountered when analyzing these models is often the representation of their iteration and solution vectors. In this paper, we present a new approach for computing bounds on solutions of transient measures in large continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs). The approach extends existing path- and uniformization-based methods by identifying sets of paths that are equivalent with respect to a reward measure and related to one another via a simple structural relationship. This relationship allows us to explore multiple paths at the same time, thus significantly increasing the number of paths that can be explored in a given amount of time. Furthermore, the use of a structured representation for the state space and the direct computation of the desired reward measure (without ever storing the solution vector) allow us to analyze very large models using a very small amount of storage. In addition to presenting the method itself we illustrate its use to compute the reliability and the availability of a large distributed information service system in which faults may propagate across subsystems.	algorithm;computation;iteration;markov chain;markov model;numerical analysis;numerical stability;parallel computing;reachability;right-to-left;simulation;state space;turing completeness;two-phase commit protocol	Vinh Vi Lam;Peter Buchholz;William H.

The bounds are inspired by properties of the junction tree algorithm, which is commonly used for calculating conditional probabilities in graphical models like Bayesian networks. We demonstrate methods for iteratively improving the upper and lower bounds until they are sufficiently tight. We illustrate properties of the algorithm by tutorial examples in the case where we want to ensure optimality and for the case where the goal is an approximate solution with a guarantee. We further use the bounds to accelerate established algorithms for constructing useful designs. An example with petroleum fields in the North Sea is studied, where the design problem is related to exploration drilling campaigns.

3cf7376b3a87abf517fa678f6dca7553d3e4d2a5	the real projective spaces in homotopy type theory		Homotopy type theory is a version of Martin-Löf type theory taking advantage of its homotopical models. In particular, we can use and construct objects of homotopy theory and reason about them using higher inductive types. In this article, we construct the real projective spaces, key players in homotopy theory, as certain higher inductive types in homotopy type theory. The classical definition of ℝP<sup>n</sup>, as the quotient space identifying antipodal points of the n-sphere, does not translate directly to homotopy type theory. Instead, we define ℝP<sup>n</sup> by induction on n simultaneously with its tautological bundle of 2-element sets. As the base case, we take ℝP<sup>−1</sup> to be the empty type. In the inductive step, we take ℝP<sup>n+1</sup> to be the mapping cone of the projection map of the tautological bundle of ℝP<sup>n</sup>, and we use its universal property and the univalence axiom to define the tautological bundle on ℝP<sup>n+1</sup>.	bottom type;diagram;homotopy type theory;intuitionistic type theory;map;mathematical induction;recursion	Ulrik Buchholtz;Egbert Rijke	2017	2017 32nd Annual ACM/IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (LICS)	10.1109/LICS.2017.8005146	homotopy category;mathematical analysis;cofibration;topology;bott periodicity theorem;classifying space;whitehead theorem;homotopy;homotopy sphere;homotopy group;mathematics;geometry;eilenberg–maclane space;homotopy hypothesis;suspension;n-connected;regular homotopy;fibration;tautological line bundle;homotopy lifting property;algebra	Logic	40.80014823079701	24.895071069079975	15884

In Part I, we begin by identifying a class of social processes which are simultaneously important in applications and difficult to predict using existing methods. It is shown that these processes can be modeled within a multi-scale, stochastic hybrid system framework that is sociologically sensible, expressive, illuminating, and amenable to formal analysis. Among other advantages, the proposed modeling framework enables proper characterization of the interplay between the intrinsic aspects of a social process (e.g., the “appeal” of a political movement) and the social dynamics which are its realization; this characterization is key to successful social process prediction. The utility of the modeling methodology is illustrated through a case study involving the global SARS epidemic of 2002–2003. Part II of the paper then leverages this modeling framework to develop a rigorous, computationally tractable approach to social process predictive analysis.	cobham's thesis;hybrid system;social dynamics;systems modeling	Richard Colbaugh;Kristin Glass	2009	2009 IEEE Control Applications, (CCA) & Intelligent Control, (ISIC)	10.1109/CCA.2009.5280709	social dynamics;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;management science;context model;markov process;statistics;hybrid system	Robotics	41.054217029525056	4.240540736956239	15911

In graph G , a robot is aware of its current location by sending signals to obtain the distances between itself and the landmarks in G . Its position is determined uniquely in G if it knows its distances to sufficiently many landmarks. The metric basis of G is defined as the minimum set of landmarks such that all other vertices in G can be uniquely determined and the metric dimension of G is defined as the cardinality of the minimum set of landmarks. The major contribution of this paper is that we have partly solved the open problem proposed by Manuel et al. [9] , by proving that the metric dimension of HDN1 ( n ) and HDN2 ( n ) are either 3 or 4. However, the problem of finding the exact metric dimension of HDN networks is still open.	metric dimension (graph theory)	Dacheng Xu;Jianxi Fan	2014	J.

This study provided valuable insights in choosing the best optimization technique for certain classes of problems. While these insights remain generally useful today, the phenomenal success of random field models means that the kinds of inference problems that have to be solved changed significantly. Specifically, the models today often include higher order interactions, flexible connectivity structures, large label-spaces of different cardinalities, or learned energy tables. To reflect these changes, we provide a modernized and enlarged study. We present an empirical comparison of more than 27 state-of-the-art optimization techniques on a corpus of 2453 energy minimization instances from diverse applications in computer vision. To ensure reproducibility, we evaluate all methods in the OpenGM 2 framework and report extensive results regarding runtime and solution quality. Key insights from our study agree with the results of Szeliski et al. for the types of models they studied. However, on new and challenging types of models our findings disagree and suggest that polyhedral methods and integer programming solvers are competitive in terms of runtime and solution quality over a large range of model types.	computer vision;energy minimization;integer programming;interaction;markov chain;markov random field;mathematical optimization;pivot table;polyhedron	Jörg H.

However, only partial information about the matrix representing the linear combinations is available. Assuming a low-rank structure for the matrix, one natural solution would be to first apply a matrix completion to the data, and then to solve the resulting compressed sensing problem. In big data applications such as massive MIMO and medical data, the matrix completion step imposes a huge computational burden. Here, we propose to reduce the computational cost of the completion task by ignoring the columns corresponding to zero elements in the sparse vector. To this end, we employ a technique to initially approximate the support of the sparse vector. We further propose to unify the partial matrix completion and sparse vector recovery into an augmented four-step problem. Simulation results reveal that the augmented approach achieves the best performance, while both proposed methods outperform the natural two-step technique with substantially less computational requirements.	approximation algorithm;big data;column (database);compressed sensing;computation;computational complexity theory;mimo;requirement;simulation;sparse matrix;the matrix	Ashkan Esmaeili;Arash Amini;Farrokh Marvasti	2016	2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)	10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7906072	database index;mathematical optimization;sparse pca;sparse matrix;information processing;information theory;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;sparse approximation;mathematics;matrix-free methods;statistics	ML	49.397762590403005	6.9099130244980405	16279

We introduce an approach whereby the (noninteger) co-array is treated as the most appropriate virtual array when considering an augmented covariance matrix. Since such virtual arrays have an incomplete set of covariance lags, we discuss various completion philosophies to fill in the missing elements of the associated partially specified Hermitian covariance matrix. This process is followed by the application of an algorithm that searches for a specific number of plane wavefronts, yielding the minimum fitting error for the specified covariance lags in the neighborhood of the completion-initialized DOA estimates. In this way, we are able to resolve possible ambiguity and to achieve asymptotically optimal estimation accuracy.

We assume that such functions belong to a separable weighted Hilbert space that is the direct sum of tensor product Hilbert spaces of functions with finitely many variables. The weight sequence γ = {γu} is used tomoderate the influence of terms depending on finitely many variables from u. We consider algorithms that use finitely many arbitrary linear functionals. Each linear functional is an inner product whose cost depends on the number of active variables of the inner product generator. That is, if the generator has d active variables then the cost is $(d) for a given non-decreasing function $. The error of an algorithm is defined in the worst case setting in a norm given by weighted L2 norms for terms depending on finitely many variables. The ε-complexity is understood as the minimal cost among all algorithms with errors at most ε. We are especially interested in polynomial tractability, where the ε-complexity is bounded by a polynomial in ε−1, and weak tractability, where the ε-complexity is sub-exponential in ε−1. The results are as follows. • An algorithm whose cost is equal to the ε-complexity.

4962542910d46aca7710dc17006b9fd93c862482	a higher homotopic extension of persistent (co)homology		Our objective in this article is to show a possibly interesting structure of ho-motopic nature appearing in persistent (co)homology. Assuming that the filtration of the (say) simplicial set embedded in R n induces a multiplicative filtration (which would not be a so harsh hypothesis in our setting) on the dg algebra given by the complex of simplicial cochains, we may use a result by T. Kadeishvili to get a unique (up to noncanonical equivalence) A∞-algebra structure on the complete persistent cohomology of the filtered simplicial (or topological) set. We then provide a construction of a (pseudo)metric on the set of all (generalized) barcodes (that is, of all cohomological degrees) enriched with the A∞-algebra structure stated before, refining the usual bottleneck metric , and which is also independent of the particular A∞-algebra structure chosen (among those equivalent to each other). We think that this distance might deserve some attention for topological data analysis, for it in particular can recognize different linking or foldings patterns, as in the Borromean rings. As an aside, we give a simple proof of a result relating the barcode structure between persistent homology and cohomology. This result was observed in [9] under some restricted assumptions, which we do not suppose.	barcode;embedded system;herman ring;homology (biology);persistent data structure;persistent homology;topological data analysis;turing completeness	Estanislao Herscovich	2014	CoRR		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;mathematics;simplicial complex;simplicial homology;algebra	Theory	39.59748005951846	26.42172143595761	16411

We propose and compare two different instantiations of a generic ACO algorithm for this problem. Basically, the generic ACO algorithm successively generates maximal cliques through the repeated addition of vertices into partial cliques, and uses “pheromone trails” as a greedy heuristic to choose, at each step, the next vertex to enter the clique. The two instantiations differ in the way pheromone trails are laid and exploited, i.e., on edges or on vertices of the graph. We illustrate the behavior of the two ACO instantiations on a representative benchmark instance and we study the impact of pheromone on the solution process. We consider two measures —the re-sampling and the dispersion ratio— for providing an insight into the performance at run time. We also study the benefit of integrating a local search procedure within the proposed ACO algorithm, and we show that this improves the solution process. Finally, we compare ACO performance with that of three other representative heuristic approaches, showing that the former obtains competitive results.	ant colony optimization algorithms;benchmark (computing);clique (graph theory);clique problem;combinatorial optimization;converge;diversification (finance);experiment;greedy algorithm;heuristic;knapsack problem;local search (optimization);loss function;mathematical optimization;maximal set;neighbourhood (graph theory);optimization problem;run time (program lifecycle phase);sampling (signal processing);vertex (geometry)	Christine Solnon;Serge Fenet	2006	J.

91bd096235867a98cbb943289bfd1461c1e6ad04	signal processing tools for radio astronomy		Radio astronomy is known for its very large telescope dishes, but is currently making a transition towards the use of large numbers of small elements. For example, the Low Frequency Array, commissioned in 2010, uses about 50 stations, each consisting of at least 96 low band antennas and 768 high band antennas. For the Square Kilometre Array, planned for 2024, the numbers will be even larger. These instruments pose interesting array signal processing challenges. To present some aspects, we start by describing how the measured correlation data is traditionally converted into an image, and translate this into an array signal processing framework. This paves the way for a number of alternative image reconstruction techniques, such as a Weighted Least Squares approach. Self-calibration of the instrument is required to handle instrumental effects such as the unknown, possibly direction dependent, response of the receiving elements, as well a unknown propagation conditions through the Earth’s troposphere and ionosphere. Array signal processing techniques seem well suited to handle these challenges. The fact that the noise power at each antenna element may be different motivates the use of Factor Analysis, as a more appropriate alternative to the eigenvalue decomposition that is commonly used in array processing. Factor Analysis also proves to be very useful for interference mitigation. Interestingly, image reconstruction, calibration and interference mitigation are often intertwined in radio astronomy, turning this into an area with very challenging signal processing problems.

3ef08da9ae334c1ad3444d6411d1e0a279c8c44f	sparse linear programming via primal and dual augmented coordinate descent		Over the past decades, Linear Programming (LP) has been widely used in different areas and considered as one of the mature technologies in numerical optimization. However, the complexity offered by state-of-the-art algorithms (i.e. interior-point method and primal, dual simplex methods) is still unsatisfactory for problems in machine learning with huge number of variables and constraints. In this paper, we investigate a general LP algorithm based on the combination of Augmented Lagrangian and Coordinate Descent (AL-CD), giving an iteration complexity of O((log(1/ ))) with O(nnz(A)) cost per iteration, where nnz(A) is the number of non-zeros in the m×n constraint matrix A, and in practice, one can further reduce cost per iteration to the order of non-zeros in columns (rows) corresponding to the active primal (dual) variables through an active-set strategy. The algorithm thus yields a tractable alternative to standard LP methods for large-scale problems of sparse solutions and nnz(A) mn. We conduct experiments on large-scale LP instances from `1-regularized multi-class SVM, Sparse Inverse Covariance Estimation, and Nonnegative Matrix Factorization, where the proposed approach finds solutions of 10−3 precision orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art implementations of interior-point and simplex methods. 1	active set method;augmented lagrangian method;cobham's thesis;column (database);coordinate descent;duplex (telecommunications);experiment;interior point method;iteration;lagrange multiplier;linear programming;machine learning;mathematical optimization;non-negative matrix factorization;numerical analysis;simplex algorithm;sparse matrix	Ian En-Hsu Yen;Kai Zhong;Cho-Jui Hsieh;Pradeep Ravikumar;Inderjit S.

d263508a389cfbc938fd1a30e723d80746d4bf9f	on gröbner bases over rings and residue class polynomial rings with torsion		Buchberger (1965) introduced Gröbner bases theory for polynomial rings over fields to give an algorithmic technique to determine a vector space basis of the residue class ring of a zero dimensional ideal. This is called as Macauley-Buchberger basis theorem, as Buchberger’s result is based on the work by Macaulay (1916). The Macaulay-Buchberger Basis theorem has been extended from polynomial rings over fields to Noetherian rings for free residue class rings in (Francis & Dukkipati, 2014). For this a Gröbner basis characterization has been given that led to an algorithmic method to test whether a residue class polynomial ring over any Noetherian rings is free or not (i.e there exists a module basis or not). This result is also an elegant generalization of the fact that Z[x]/〈f〉 is free if and only f is monic, to a mulivariate case, over any Noetherian rings. In this work (Dukkipati et al., 2014) we generalize the Macaulay-Buchberger basis theorem for residue class ring A[x1, . . . , xn]/a, in the case when it is finitely generated as an A-module but need not necessarily a free module, where A is a Noetherian ring and a is an ideal. This generalization gives us an insight into the nature of generating sets that span A-module A[x1, . . . , xn]/a and allows to study the concept of border bases over rings. We present a border division algorithm over rings and prove termination of the algorithm for a special class of border bases called acyclic border bases. We show the existence of such border bases and present some characterizations in this regard. We believe that this study helps in improving Gröbner basis methods for polynomial rings over rings in the cases, where ideals that give rise to (i) finitely generated residue class polynomial rings that are free, and (ii) finitely generated residue class polynomial rings with torsion.	basis (linear algebra);buchberger's algorithm;directed acyclic graph;division algorithm;francis;gröbner basis;low basis theorem;macaulay;monic polynomial;polynomial ring;torsion (gastropod)	Ambedkar Dukkipati;Nithish Pai;Maria Francis;Abhishek Dubey	2015	ACM Comm.

We show that the property of containing a graph in $${\mathcal {C}}$$ C as an induced subgraph is almost monotone if $${\mathcal {C}}$$ C is the set of thetas, the set of pyramids, or the set of prisms and thetas. We show that the property of containing a hole of length $$\equiv j \mod n$$ ≡jmodn is almost monotone if and only if $$j \equiv 2 \mod n$$ j≡2modn or $$n \le 2$$ n≤2 . Moreover, we show that the imperfect graph sandwich problem, also known as the Berge trigraph recognition problem, can be solved in polynomial time. We also study the complexity of several graph decompositions related to perfect graphs, namely clique cutset, (full) star cutset, homogeneous set, homogeneous pair, and 1-join, with respect to the partitioned and unpartitioned probe problems. We show that the clique cutset and full star cutset unpartitioned probe problems are NP-hard. We show that for these five decompositions, the partitioned probe problem is in P, and the homogeneous set, 1-join, 1-join in the complement, and full star cutset in the complement unpartitioned probe problems can be solved in polynomial time as well.	algorithm;clique problem;cut (graph theory);digraphs and trigraphs;graph sandwich problem;induced subgraph;kleene star;np-completeness;np-hardness;polynomial;pyramid (geometry);skew partition;time complexity;monotone	Maria Chudnovsky;Celina M.

A k-partition is a set partition with k classes and a k-partition is said to be uniform if every class has the same cardinality c = n/k. In this paper, we prove a higher order generalization of the Erdős-Ko-Rado theorem for systems of pairwise t-intersecting uniform k-partitions of an n-set. We prove that for n large enough, any such system contains at most 1 (k−t)! ( n−tc c )( n−(t+1)c c ) · · · (n−(k−1)c c ) partitions and this bound is only attained by a trivially t-intersecting system. We also prove that for t = 1, the result is valid for all n. We conclude with some conjectures on this and other types of intersecting partition systems.	erdős number	Karen Meagher;Lucia Moura	2005	Electr. J. Comb.

In this paper we study the variant of the multi-armed bandit problem where the exploration phase involves costly experiments and occurs before the exploitation phase; and where each play of an arm during the exploration phase updates a prior belief about the arm. The problem of finding an inexpensive exploration strategy to optimize a certain exploitation objective is NP-Hard even when a single play reveals all information about an arm, and all exploration steps cost the same. We provide the first polynomial time constant-factor approximation algorithm for this class of problems. We show that this framework also generalizes several problems of interest studied in the context of data acquisition in sensor networks. Our analyses also extends to switching and setup costs, and to concave utility objectives. Our solution approach is via a novel linear program rounding technique based on stochastic packing. In addition to yielding exploration policies whose performance is within a small constant factor of the adaptive optimal policy, a nice feature of this approach is that the resulting policies explore the arms sequentially without revisiting any arm. Sequentiality is a well-studied paradigm in decision theory, and is very desirable in domains where multiple explorations can be conducted in parallel, for instance, in the sensor network context.	apx;approximation algorithm;coat of arms;concave function;data acquisition;decision theory;design of experiments;expectation–maximization algorithm;experiment;exploit (computer security);linear programming;mathematical optimization;multi-armed bandit;np-hardness;online optimization;polynomial;programming paradigm;rounding;set packing;time complexity	Sudipto Guha;Kamesh Munagala	2007	CoRR		time complexity;adaptive optimization;mathematical optimization;simulation;wireless sensor network;data structure;decision theory;multi-armed bandit;computer science;sequential analysis;machine learning;data acquisition;programming language;algorithm	ML	46.765953890511	5.699300404603686	16708

Here, connections between two other entanglement measures the relative entropy of entanglement and the geometric measure of entanglement -are investigated. It is found that for arbitrary pure states the latter gives rise to a lower bound on the former. For certain pure states, some bipartite and some multipartite, this lower bound is saturated, and thus their relative entropy of entanglement can be found analytically in terms of their known geometric measure of entanglement. For certain mixed states, upper bounds on the relative entropy of entanglement are also established. Numerical evidence strongly suggests that these upper bounds are tight, i.e., they are actually the relative entropy of entanglement.	geometric measure of entanglement;kullback–leibler divergence;numerical method;quantum entanglement;quantum information;quantum relative entropy;quantum state	Tzu-Chieh Wei;Marie Ericsson;Paul M.

dab2b952796ed27a44f13afc2fe05b16b33230db	logical information theory: new logical foundations for information theory		here is a new theory of information based on logic. The definition of Shannon entropy as well as the notions on joint, conditional, and mutual entropy as defined by Shannon can all be derived by a uniform transformation from the corresponding formulas of logical information theory. Information is first defined in terms of sets of distinctions without using any probability measure. When a probability measure is introduced, the logical entropies are simply the values of the (product) probability measure on the sets of distinctions. The compound notions of joint, conditional, and mutual entropies are obtained as the values of the measure, respectively, on the union, difference, and intersection of the sets of distinctions. These compound notions of logical entropy satisfy the usual Venn diagram relationships (e.g., inclusion-exclusion formulas) since they are values of a measure (in the sense of measure theory). The uniform transformation into the formulas for Shannon entropy is linear so it explains the long-noted fact that the Shannon formulas satisfy the Venn diagram relations--as an analogy or mnemonic--since Shannon entropy is not a measure (in the sense of measure theory) on a given set.rnWhat is the logic that gives rise to logical information theory? Partitions are dual (in a category-theoretic sense) to subsets, and the logic of partitions was recently developed in a dual/parallel relationship to the Boolean logic of subsets (the latter being usually mis-specified as the special case of propositional logic). Boole developed logical probability theory as the normalized counting measure on subsets. Similarly the normalized counting measure on partitions is logical entropy--when the partitions are represented as the set of distinctions that is the complement to the equivalence relation for the partition.rnIn this manner, logical information theory provides the set-theoretic and measure-theoretic foundations for information theory. The Shannon theory is then derived by the transformation that replaces the counting of distinctions with the counting of the number of binary partitions (bits) it takes, on average, to make the same distinctions by uniquely encoding the distinct elements--which is why the Shannon theory perfectly dovetails into coding and communications theory.	information theory	David Ellerman	2017	Logic Journal of the IGPL	10.1093/jigpal/jzx022	algorithm;mathematics;combinatorics;information theory and measure theory;discrete mathematics;variation of information;joint entropy;information diagram;truth table;decidability;shannon's source coding theorem;conditional mutual information	Theory	45.27557280275661	17.692700083839696	16799

The solutions are in product from and can be calculated iteratively. This iteration is equivalent to disaggregating macro probabilities, multiplying with transition probabilities, and aggregating the obtained state probabilities-we call it DA iteration. Large Markov chains with many states can be solved, so large that the state probabilities could neither be stored nor calculated in any computer. Accurate approximations are obtained, and moreover, the accuracy can be influenced: The more aggregates are considered, the better the approximations are, if the aggregates are chosen suitably. Practical experience is encouraging: The obtained accuracy compares favourably with other approximation methods and with exact solutions. In this paper, we discuss steady state probabilities, but time-dependent solutions are also obtainable. 01997 Elsevier Science B.V.	aggregate function;approximation algorithm;blocking (computing);carrier-to-noise ratio;haplogroup cz (mtdna);iterated function;iteration;markov chain;performance evaluation;steady state;stochastic petri net;unity	Johann Christoph Strelen	1997	Perform.

A different approach is proposed here and shown to also result in anO(n logn) algorithm. The new approach has the advantage that it can also solve more general problems. In particular, it is shown that if the center ofC is constrained to lie in an arbitrary convexn-gon, an0(n logn) algorithm can still be obtained. Finally, an0(n logn +k logn) algorithm is given for solving this problem when the center ofC is constrained to lie in an arbitrary simplen-gonP. wherek denotes the number of intersections occurring between edges ofP and edges of the Voronoi diagram ofQ andk ⩽O(n 2).	convex hull;genetic algorithm;largest empty sphere;voronoi diagram	Godfried T.

The existence of Malliavin weights relies on absolute continuity of laws of the projected diffusion process and a sufficiently regular density. In this article we first prove results on absolute continuity for laws of projected jump-diffusion processes in finite and infinite dimensions, and a general result on the existence of Malliavin weights in finite dimension. In both cases we assume Hörmander conditions and hypotheses on the invertibility of the so-called linkage operators. The message is that for the construction of numerical procedures for the calculation of the Greeks in fairly general jumpdiffusion cases one can proceed as in a pure diffusion case. We also show how the given results apply to infinite dimensional questions in mathematical Finance. There we start with a Vasiček model, and add – by pertaining no arbitrage – a jump diffusion component. We prove that we can obtain in this case an interest rate model, where the law of any projection is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure on R .	linkage (software);numerical analysis;scott continuity;vasicek model	Barbara Forster;Eva Lütkebohmert;Josef Teichmann	2008	SIAM J.

c22c0453ab1dd28f19e1d3f4b9b977944dce49f6	characterizations and kullback-leibler divergence of gompertz distributions		In this note, we characterize the Gompertz distribution in terms of extreme value distributions and point out that it implicitly models the interplay of two antagonistic growth processes. In addition, we derive a closed form expressions for the Kullback-Leibler divergence between two Gompertz Distributions. Although the latter is rather easy to obtain, it seems not to have been widely reported before. 1 The Gompertz Distribution The Gompertz distribution provides a statistical formulation of the Gompertz law of mortality [1]. Its probability density function (pdf) is defined for x ∈ [0,∞) and given by f(x | b, q) = e b q e e e bx (1) where the parameter b > 0 determines scale and q > 0 is a shape parameter. The corresponding cumulative density function (cdf) amounts to F (x | b, q) = 1− e e e bx (2) and will be of interest in our discussion below. Regarding the density in (1), we note that it is unimodal and rather flexible. Depending on the choice of b and q, it may be skewed to the left or to the right; however, for q ≥ 1, its mode will always be at 0. Due to its origins as a model of mortality, the Gompertz distribution is a staple in statistical biology and the demographic and actuarial sciences [2,3]. It was observed to model income distributions [4] and has been used as a model of the diffusion of novel products as well as of customer life-time values [5,6,7] in economics and marketing . Finally, in the context of social media analysis, the Gompertz distribution was found to account well for the temporal evolution of collective attention to viral Web content or social media services [8,9]. Our goal with this note is to provide an accessible account of some of the properties of the Gompertz distribution. Furthermore, we derive a closed form expression for the Kullback-Leibler divergence between Gompertz distributions which is useful for the purpose of model selection or statistical inference. 2 Interpretation in Terms of Extreme Value Distributions Interestingly, the Gompertz distribution is rather closely related to extreme value theory. Here, we briefly demonstrate that it can be expressed in terms of the three extreme value distributions. First of all, the Gompertz distribution corresponds to a zero-truncated Gumbel minimum distribution. The Gumbel distribution is the type I extreme value distribution. When used to model the distribution of sample minima, its pdf is defined for x ∈ (−∞,∞) and usually expressed as fG(x | m, s) = 1 s e e (x−m)/s = 1 s e x s e m s e x s e− m s (3) where m is a location parameter and s > 0 determines scale. Hence, defining b = 1s and q = e −m/s allows us to re-parameterize (3) and to write it as fG(x | b, q) = b q e bx e e bx (4) such that the corresponding cumulative density function amounts to FG(x | b, q) = 1− e −q e . (5) Looking at the cumulative density in (5), we note that limx→∞ FG(x) = 1 as well as FG(0) = 1− e . Accordingly, by left truncating the density in (4) at 0, we obtain a distribution whose pdf is given by fG(x) ∫∞ 0 fG(x)dx = fG(x) 1− FG(0) = fG(x) 1− (1 − e−q) = efG(x) = e q b q e e e bx . (6) This, however, is indeed the probability density of the Gompertz distribution as introduced in (1). Second of all, the Gompertz is indirectly related to the Fréchet and to the Weibull distribution. The Fréchet distribution is the type II extreme value distribution. It is usually defined for x ∈ (0,∞) in which case its pdf is given by fF(x | a, r) = a r x r )−1−a e−( x r ) −a (7) where a > 0 and r > 0 are shape and scale parameters, respectively. The Weibull distribution is the type III extreme value distribution. It is commonly defined for x ∈ [0,∞) and its pdf amount to fW(x | k, l) = k l x l )k−1 e( x l ) k (8) where k > 0 and l > 0 are shape and scale parameters, respectively. In order to expose the connections between the densities in (7) and (8) and the Gompertz density in (1), we recall that if a random variable X is distributed according to fX(x), the monotonously transformed random variable Y = h(X) has a pdf that is given by fY (y) = fX ( h(y) ) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ d dy h(y) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ . (9) Using this identity, it is straightforward to see that the Gompertz distribution also results from transforming Fréchet or Weibull distributions. In particular, if fX(x) is a Fréchet density and y = − lnx, then x = e and dx dy = −e (10)	bsd;emoticon;extreme value theory;gompertz function;kullback–leibler divergence;maxima and minima;model selection;portable document format;social media;truncation;web content	Christian Bauckhage	2014	CoRR		econometrics;calculus;mathematics;gompertz distribution;statistics	ML	45.52186858308518	11.870671710553019	17113

Alice and Bob each have a parent set consisting of s child sets, each containing at most h elements from a universe of size u. They want to reconcile their sets of sets in a scenario where the total number of differences between all of their child sets (under the minimum difference matching between their child sets) is d. We give several algorithms for this problem, and discuss applications to reconciliation problems on graphs, databases, and collections of documents. We specifically focus on graph reconciliation, providing protocols based on sets of sets reconciliation for random graphs from G(n,p) and for forests of rooted trees.	algorithm;alice and bob;database;random graph	Michael Mitzenmacher;Tom Morgan	2018		10.1145/3196959.3196988	combinatorics;mathematics;partition refinement;discrete mathematics;hash function;graph isomorphism;disjoint sets;alice and bob;random graph;family of sets;graph	DB	28.289008229062752	23.972715220366503	17295

It is redefined in this article as 2-adjacency. In general hypergraphs, hyperedges hold for n-adic relationship. To keep the n-adic relationship the concepts of k-adjacency and e-adjacency are defined. In graphs 2-adjacency and e-adjacency concepts match, just as k-adjacency and e-adjacency do for k-uniform hypergraphs. For general hypergraphs these concepts are different. This paper also contributes in a uniformization process of a general hypergraph to allow the definition of an e-adjacency tensor, viewed as a hypermatrix, reflecting the general hypergraph structure. This symmetric e-adjacency hypermatrix allows to capture not only the degree of the vertices and the cardinality of the hyperedges but also makes a full separation of the different layers of a hypergraph.	definition;vertex (geometry)	Xavier Ouvrard;Jean-Marie Le Goff;Stéphane Marchand-Maillet	2017	CoRR		mathematics;discrete mathematics;cardinality;combinatorics;tensor;vertex (geometry);constraint graph;hypergraph;adjacency list;pairwise comparison;polynomial	ML	33.37407377193838	26.450651013304814	17400

We present a preprocessor that improves the performance of the classical spring embedder, which can be used in conjunction with other optimization and approximation techniques. It creates an initial graph layout with edge lengths that are approximately equal and with a minimum node separation from which the spring embedder typically needs far fewer iterations to produce a well laid out graph. Introduction. The spring embedder [1] is a widely used method for drawing general graphs. In its classical form, the layout is randomized before the iterative force process is simulated. We present a preprocessor for the spring embedder, discussed in more detail in [5]. Our preprocessor is a two phase process and is used before the spring embedder is initiated. The first phase attempts to keep connected nodes at a suitably close distance by an iterative method that produces edges lengths close to a user specified ideal. The second phase approximates an even node distribution by placing the nodes on a grid. The spring embedder, or some other optimized force directed variant, is applied after these two phases. In some specialized cases, such as grid or mesh like structures, or some graphs exhibiting strong clusters, the graph can be drawn with just the preprocessor and without requiring any subsequent spring embedding. Previous work in preprocessing includes placing the graph in simple binary trees or meshes [2]. The Wave Front method [6] applies the spring embedder to a subgraph wave that sweeps through the graph. Other work on initial placement includes [4] which adds nodes to the layout incrementally, placing nodes at the barycenter of its three closest graph theoretical distance neighbours. This is followed by a local application of the force directed drawing process on the node, considering just its neigbours. Brief Description of the Method. We use force models based on those of Fruchterman and Reingold, which defines k, the ideal minimum node separation. In this model, the repulsive force between nodes is -k 2 /d and the attractive force due to edges is d 2 /k, where d is the distance between the two nodes. The first phase of the preprocessor attempts to obtain an initial drawing where all edge lengths are approximately equal to ka, where a ≥ 1, as the spring embedder appears to perform better when reducing the volume of the graph slightly. Preliminary experimentation suggests that a = g 1/3 is a reasonable value, where g is the mean degree of nodes in the graph. Prior to phase one, the nodes are randomly distributed within a cubic volume of side length 10 3 ka(|N| 1/3 ), which is large enough to ensure good results, as the layout will rapidly shrink with the extropic application of the iterative first phase. Each iteration of phase one involves visiting every node in the graph. For each node n, we examine the set of emanating edges. Each edge connects n to mi and we calculate the position of point pi such that the vector mipi = ka(ui), where ui is the unit vector of min. Node n is moved to the mean position of all pi of n. The graph rapidly shrinks into a more stable graph where each edge length is near to ka. Each iteration has linear time complexity, O(|E|). Phase one often leaves dense clusters of nodes very close together, so we now apply the second phase in order to achieve a minimum node separation. This places the nodes on a three-dimensional grid of unit size k. This is much quicker than the first phase, as it is not iterative. Application of both phases results in a new graph layout where edge lengths remain close to the phase one ideal value of ka, whilst ensuring all nodes have the final graph ideal minimum node separation of k. This yields the initial drawing to which we apply the spring embedder. Summary of Results and Further Work. Preliminary results show the method is promising in improving the speed of the spring embedding process. The spring embedder finds an equilibrium for medium sized graphs of about 200 nodes approximately 10 times faster than with a random layout [5]. The time taken for the preprocessing is insignificant compared to the time required for spring embedding. Further experiments with optimized spring embedders also show improvements in performance. In some cases spring embedding was not required, as the preprocessor produced a good layout. Systematic testing with larger graphs and alongside other preprocessing methods is now needed to explore the benefits of the method. The method has been implemented in Java with a focus on encapsulation and reuse; however, a radical performance increase could be gained by concentrating on optimising the code in an effective environment. Also requiring consideration is integration with other optimization and approximation techniques, as the method is amenable to integration with common force approximation methods such as Barnes-Hut tree coding methods, and with multilevel clustering methods.	approximation;binary tree;cluster analysis;cubic function;encapsulation (networking);experiment;graph (discrete mathematics);graph drawing;iteration;iterative method;java;ka band;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;preprocessor;randomized algorithm;randomness;time complexity;while	Paul Mutton;Peter Rodgers	2002		10.1007/3-540-36151-0_40	combinatorics;binary tree;computer science;theoretical computer science;computer programming;mathematics;preprocessor;algorithm	ML	32.57628307339	17.483969092491847	17854
6984e5dfd24a4adefba700c06afb3530030774a8	a blichfeldt-type theorem for h-points	null	Let H be the set of vertices of a tiling of the plane by regular hexagons of unit area. A point of H is called an H-point. Let [s] denote the greatest integer less than or equal to s, and let fsg {s} = s - [s]. In this paper we prove a Blichfeldt-type theorem for H-points. It is shown that for any bounded set D C R 2 of area s, if 0 ≤ {s} < 1/3, then D can be translated so as to cover at least 2[s] + 1 H-points; if 1/3 ≤ {s} < 1, then by a translation D can be made to cover at least 2[s] + 2 H-points. Furthermore, we show that the results obtained are the best possible. © The Mathematical Association of America.

In this paper, we give a structural description of the class of all P5-free graphs containing a good 2K2. In particular, we prove that the maximum weight independent set problem for the class of all P5-free graphs containing a good 2K2 can be solved in linear time by proving that every connected graph in this class is a tent which has two disjoint homogeneous sets.	connectivity (graph theory);graph (discrete mathematics);independent set (graph theory);time complexity	M.

A recent result, proved independently by Schmid/Mullen and Lawrence, establishes an equivalence between (T,M,S)-nets and ordered orthogonal arrays. In a paper of Martin and Stinson, a linear programming technique is described which gives lower bounds on the size of an ordered orthogonal array and, hence, on the quality parameter T of a (T,M,S)-net. In this correspondence, these ideas are used to derive a dual Plotkin bound for ordered orthogonal arrays. For a (T,M,S)-net in base b, this bound implies TgesM+1-S/1-bM-Slscr(lscr-1/b-1/b2 -middotmiddotmiddot-1/blscr), where lscr=1+lfloorM-T/Srfloor.

We call X a broken circuit of e. A broken circuit clutter is the collection of broken circuits of a fixed element. Seymour [The matroids with the max-flow min-cut property, J. Combinatorial Theory B 23 (1977) 189–222] proved that a broken circuit clutter of a binary matroid has the max-flow min-cut property if and only if it does not contain a minor isomorphic to Q6. We shall present an analogue of this result in affine convex geometries. Precisely, we shall show that a broken circuit clutter of an element e in a convex geometry arising from two-dimensional point configuration has the max-flow min-cut property if and only if the configuration has no subset forming a ‘Pentagon’ configuration with center e. Firstly we introduce the notion of closed set systems. This leads to a common generalization of rooted circuits both of matroids and convex geometries (antimatroids). We further study some properties of affine convex geometries and their broken circuit clutters. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Optimally allocated measurement devices are the backbone of advanced metering systems for concrete observability and accurate state estimation (SE). This paper proposes a new approach for optimized meter placement in distribution grids by minimizing errors in estimated state vector. The placement problem is formulated on the principles of Fisher information formalism and exploits the D-optimality criterion in the context of convex optimization theory. A Boolean-convex model is developed for minimizing an objective function expressing a measure of the SE quality, subject to linear equality constraints. The proposed algorithm is characterized by flexibility and low complexity. Thorough simulations, using a 136-bus distribution network, are carried out to verify the performance of the proposed approach.	algorithm;approximation;computational complexity theory;convex optimization;fisher information;internet backbone;linear equation;loss function;mathematical optimization;numerical linear algebra;optimal design;optimality criterion;optimization problem;real-time clock;semantics (computer science);simulation	Themistoklis C.

0cecacecfaa28e7019748f51ae38ed71b06f2499	robust adaptive beamforming for multiple-input multiple-output radar with spatial filtering techniques		In this paper, we consider robust adaptive beamformer design for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar systems. The desired transmit-receive steering vector is estimated through maximizing the output power subject to constraints upon correlation coefficient and steering vector norm. The original nonconvex problem is reformulated as two reduced dimension semi-definite programming (SDP) problems. An iterative procedure is devised to tackle the two SDP problems, whose convergence is analytically proven. Based on the estimated desired signal, we are then able to obtain the interference covariance matrix via the matrix rank-constrained minimization method. Compared to other robust adaptive beamforming methods for MIMO radar, the proposed approach has the advantages of high efficiency and accuracy. Simulation results are presented to confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach. © 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V. v d i m s h i d o p e d [ [ t p n s o	adaptive beamformer;beamforming;coefficient;interference (communication);iterative method;mimo;radar;robustness (computer science);semiconductor industry;semidefinite programming;simulation;the matrix	Junhui Qian;Zishu He;Wei Zhang;Yulong Huang;Ning Fu;Jonathon A.

Natural solutions to use as landmarks are those lying near to the edges of the mutually non-dominating set. We propose four definitions of edge points for many-objective mutually non-dominating sets and examine the relations between them. The first defines edge points to be those that extend the range of the attainment surface. This is shown to be equivalent to finding points which are not dominated on projection onto subsets of the objectives. If the objectives are to be minimised, a further definition considers points which are not dominated under maximisation when projected onto objective subsets. A final definition looks for edges via alternative projections of the set. We examine the relations between these definitions and their efficacy in many dimensions for synthetic concave- and convex-shaped sets, and on solutions to a prototypical many-objective optimisation problem, showing how they can reveal information about the structure of the estimated Pareto front. We show that the “controlling dominance area of solutions” modification of the dominance relation can be effectively used to locate edges and interior points of high-dimensional mutually non-dominating sets.	dominating set;greater than;mathematical optimization;pareto efficiency;projections and predictions;solutions;synthetic intelligence;telling untruths	Richard M.

We define a family of goodness measures for arbitrary sensing matrices as a set of optimization problems, and design algorithms with a theoretical global convergence guarantee to compute these goodness measures. The proposed algorithms solve a series of second-order cone programs, or linear programs. As a by-product, we implement an efficient algorithm to verify a sufficient condition for exact ℓ1 recovery in the noise-free case. This implementation performs orders-of-magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art techniques. We derive performance bounds on the ℓ∞ norms of the recovery errors in terms of these goodness measures. We establish connections between other performance criteria (e.g., the ℓ2 norm, ℓ1 norm, and support recovery) and the ℓ∞ norm in a tight manner. We also analytically demonstrate that the developed goodness measures are non-degenerate for a large class of random sensing matrices, as long as the number of measurements is relatively large. Numerical experiments show that, compared with the restricted isometry based performance bounds, our error bounds apply to a wider range of problems and are tighter, when the sparsity levels of the signals are relatively low.	algorithm;basis pursuit;compressed sensing;computable function;detection theory;experiment;formal verification;least squares;linear programming;local convergence;mathematical optimization;numerical method;optimization problem;performance evaluation;performance tuning;polynomial;restricted isometry property;sparse matrix;taxicab geometry;time complexity;transmitter	Gongguo Tang;Arye Nehorai	2011	2011 45th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems	10.1109/CISS.2011.5766115	optimization problem;algorithm design;minimisation;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;sparse matrix;computer science;sensor;noise measurement;theoretical computer science;mathematics;compressed sensing;statistics	ML	48.98974197794927	8.2098383929298	18740

Equivalently, an ordered field F is real closed if and only if the field extension F ( √−1) is algebraically closed. The main example of a real closed field is the field of real numbers. It is wellknown that a real closed field has a unique ordering, so any isomorphism of real closed fields is order-preserving. In [5], it is proved that any two real closed fields whose order types are the same uncountable saturated ordering are isomorphic. Recall than an ηα set is a dense linear ordering without endpoints of power אα in which any cut given by fewer than אα formulas is realized. The ηα sets were introduced by Hausdorff in [7].

9683148cef0bb77f0d0e6420349e6866e3491498	representation theorems for equivalent optimization problems	optimization problem;representation theorem	In conjunction with the problem of transforming a given optimization problem into a form from which the functional equations of dynamic programming are obtainable, Karp and Held (1967) made clear the relation between a certain class of decision processes and dynamic programming from the view point of automata theory. This paper also follows the line of Karp and Held, and presents a number of new concepts. First we assume that a given optimization problem is discrete and deterministic: it is given in the form of discrete decision process (ddp). Then we define six classes of decision processes: sdp (sequential decision process), msdp (monotone sdp), smsdp (strictly monotone sdp), pmsdp (positively monotone sdp), ap (additive process), and lmsdp (loop-flee msdp). The sdp is considered as a general model of a decision process with finite states. The msdp is a subclass of sdp's from which the functional equations of dynamic programming are obtainable. The smsdp, pmsdp, ap, and lmsdp are subclasses of msdp's, which have simpler structures than that of msdp. In fact, simpler solution methods for solving the resulting functional equations are available for these subclasses. Two types of representation theorems are first proved for each class of decision processes: one is the w (weak)-representation theorem which is a necessary and sufficient condition for a given ddp to be realized by a decision process of the specific class in the sense that both have the same set of optimal policies, and the other is the s (strong)-representation theorem, which assumes the coincidence of cost value for each feasible policy in addition to the above condition. Based on the w-representation theorems, various properties of sets of optimal policies are investigated for each class. In particular, it is shown that although sets of optimal policies of sdp and msdp are not dosed under most of operations, they are closed for smsdp, pmsdp, ap, and Imsdp. In fact, a set of policies can be a set of optimal policies of an smsdp, pmsdp, or ap if and only if it is regular (i.e., accepted by a finite automaton). For an lmsdp, a set can be a set of optimal policies if and only if it is finite.	automata theory;automaton;dynamic programming;finite-state machine;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;utility functions on indivisible goods;monotone	Toshihide Ibaraki	1972	Information and Control	10.1016/S0019-9958(72)90125-8	optimization problem;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;computer science;mathematics;algorithm;algebra	Theory	37.31462555683775	5.313196003012511	18850

In addition, most of them are designed for special angular signal distribution functions. As a result, their performances will degenerate when deal with different sources with different angular signal distribution functions or unknown angular signal distribution functions. In this paper, a low-complexity decoupled DOAs estimation method without searching using two parallel uniform linear arrays (ULAs) is proposed for coherently distributed sources, as well as a novel parameter matching method. It can resolve the problems mentioned above efficiently.

Our result implies that all maximal induced matchings in an n-vertex triangle-free graph can be listed in time O(1.4423), yielding the fastest known algorithm for finding a maximum induced matching in a triangle-free graph.	algorithm;fastest;induced subgraph;matching (graph theory);maximal set	Manu Basavaraju;Pinar Heggernes;Pim van 't Hof;Reza Saei;Yngve Villanger	2016	Journal of Graph Theory	10.1002/jgt.21994	strong perfect graph theorem;1-planar graph;block graph;apollonian network;pathwidth;mathematical optimization;split graph;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;cograph;dense graph;graph coloring;mathematics;maximal independent set;modular decomposition;partial k-tree;chordal graph;indifference graph	Theory	26.727974623353504	27.110213806685657	18873

Positions are known that require 20 moves, and it has already been shown that there are no positions that require 27 or more moves; this is a surprisingly large gap. This paper describes a program that is able to find solutions of length 20 or less at a rate of more than 16 million positions a second. We use this program, along with some new ideas and incremental improvements in other techniques, to show that there is no position that requires 26 moves.	cube	Tomas Rokicki	2008	CoRR			HCI	29.763331521775832	13.316758722210208	18928

We generate a set of samples in the configuration space, precompute an approximation of the contact space for two intersecting objects using binary classification techniques, and construct a bijective mapping between the spherical space and the precomputed contact space. For a given in-collision configuration, we search the spherical space for the nearest neighbor and find the corresponding image in the contact space based on the predefined spherical parameterization. The resulting image is a witness equivalent to the nearest configuration and is used to formulate the penetration depth direction based on our measure. Unlike prior algorithms, our algorithm guarantees that both the penetration depth magnitude and direction are continuous with respect to the motion parameters. Our algorithm is approximate in a sense that we approximate the exact contact space, and we have applied our algorithm to complex rigid models composed of tens or hundreds of thousands of triangles and the runtime query takes only around 0.01 milliseconds.	approximation algorithm;binary classification;precomputation	Xinyu Zhang;Young J.

We then use this forcing in a reverse Easton iteration to obtain an extension universe with morasses at every regular uncountable cardinal, while preserving all n-superstrong (1 ≤ n ≤ ω), hyperstrong and 1-extendible cardinals. In the latter case, a preliminary forcing to make the GCH hold is required. Our forcing yields morasses that satisfy an extra property related to the homogeneity of the partial order; we refer to them as mangroves and prove that their existence is equivalent to the existence of morasses. Finally, we exhibit a partial order that forces universal morasses to exist at every regular uncountable cardinal, and use this to show that universal morasses are consistent with n-superstrong, hyperstrong, and 1-extendible cardinals. This all contributes to the second author’s outer model programme, the aim of which is to show that L-like principles can hold in outer models which nevertheless contain large cardinals. §	iteration	Andrew D.

BCNs are recently attracting considerable interest as computational models for genetic and cellular networks with exogenous inputs. The topological entropy of a BCN with m inputs is a nonnegative real number in the interval [0,m log 2]. Roughly speaking, a larger topological entropymeans that asymptotically the control is ‘‘more powerful’’. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a BCN to have the maximal possible topological entropy. Our condition is stated in the framework of Cheng’s algebraic state-space representation of BCNs. This means that verifying this condition incurs an exponential time-complexity. We also show that the problem of determining whether a BCN with n state variables and m = n inputs has a maximum topological entropy is NP-hard, suggesting that this problem cannot be solved in general using a polynomial-time algorithm. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

adf2e8cc7b4f6478a170d794c18ca1d7e6419a51	on the number of fuzzy subgroups of finite symmetric groups		One of the most important problems of fuzzy group theory is to classify the fuzzy subgroups of a finite group. This topic has enjoyed a rapid development in the last few years. Several papers have treated the particular case of finite abelian groups. Thus, in [13] the number of distinct fuzzy subgroups of a finite cyclic group of square-free order is determined, while [14–16] and [28] deal with this number for cyclic groups of order pnqm (p, q primes). Also, recall here the paper [25], where a recurrence relation is indicated which can successfully be used to count the number of distinct fuzzy subgroups for two classes of finite abelian groups: (arbitrary) finite cyclic groups and finite elementary abelian p-groups. The explicit formula obtained for the first class leads in [22] to an expression of the well-known central Delannoy numbers. Other related works on this topic are [1, 3, 4, 17, 24].	first-class function;recurrence relation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Marius Tarnauceanu	2013	Multiple-Valued Logic and Soft Computing		locally finite group;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;group of lie type;cycle graph;symmetric group;representation theory of the symmetric group;algebra	DB	40.39057596756255	30.637860165070073	19247

Spiders have 8, insects just 6. Spider graphs are a very restricted class of graphs that naturally appear in the context of cograph editing. The vertex set of a spider (or its complement) is naturally partitioned into a clique (the body), an independent set (the legs), and a rest (serving as the head). Here we show that spiders can be recognized directly from their degree sequences through the number of their legs (vertices with degree 1). Furthermore, we completely characterize the degree sequences of spiders. Mathematics Subject Classification (2010).

This memory is called a tabu list and contains vertices already visited by the walker. The size of the tabu list being bounded, the way vertices are inserted and removed from the list, called here an update rule, has an important impact on the performance of the walk, namely the mean hitting time between two given vertices. We define a large class of tabu random walks, characterized by their update rules. We enunciate a necessary and sufficient condition on these update rules that ensures the finiteness of the mean hitting time of their associated walk on every finite and connected graph. According to the memory allocated to the tabu list, we characterize the update rules which yield smallest mean hitting times on a large class of graphs. Finally, we compare the performances of three collections of classical update rules according to the size of their associated tabu list.	amiga walker;connectivity (graph theory);performance;tabu search;vertex (geometry)	Karine Altisen;Stéphane Devismes;Antoine Gerbaud;Pascal Lafourcade	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-31104-8_22	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	29.79947983085804	25.25654403283383	19350

We use the well-known family of $NK$ landscapes as an example. In our case the inherent network is the graph where the vertices are all the local maxima and edges mean basin adjacency between two maxima. We exhaustively extract such networks on representative small NK landscape instances, and show that they are 'small-worlds'. However, the maxima graphs are not random, since their clustering coefficients are much larger than those of corresponding random graphs. Furthermore, the degree distributions are close to exponential instead of Poissonian. We also describe the nature of the basins of attraction and their relationship with the local maxima network.	cluster analysis;coefficient;local optimum;maxima and minima;random graph;social network;time complexity;whole earth 'lectronic link	Gabriela Ochoa;Marco Tomassini;Sébastien Vérel;Christian Darabos	2008		10.1145/1389095.1389204	mathematical optimization;computer science;complex network	ML	36.3453872402992	13.581375694490239	19414

This graph represents an optimal way to pack spheres in the three-dimensional space. In this grid, the vertices represent the spheres and the edges represent the contact between spheres. We give lower and upper bounds on the chromatic number of the d power of the face-centered cubic grid. In particular, in the case d = 2 we prove that the chromatic number of this grid is 13. We also determine sharper bounds for d = 3 and for subgraphs of of the face-centered cubic grid.	cubic function;graph coloring	Nicolas Gastineau;Olivier Togni	2018	CoRR		grid;combinatorics;mathematics;chromatic scale;cubic crystal system;vertex (geometry);graph	HPC	32.444289829313476	22.72338869248184	19499

Many of the problems on which these procedures have been effective are non-Boolean in that they are most naturally formulated in terms of variables with domain sizes greater than two. Approaches to solving non-Boolean satisfiability problems fall into two categories. In the direct approach, the problem is tackled by an algorithm for non-Boolean problems. In the transformation approach, the non-Boolean problem is reformulated as an equivalent Boolean problem and then a Boolean solver is used. This paper compares four methods for solving non-Boolean problems: one direct and three transformational. The comparison first examines the search spaces confronted by the four methods, and then tests their ability to solve random formulas, the round-robin sports scheduling problem, and the quasigroup completion problem. The experiments show that the relative performance of the methods depends on the domain size of the problem and that the direct method scales better as domain size increases. Along the route to performing these comparisons we make three other contributions. First, we generalize Walksat, a highly successful stochastic local search procedure for Boolean satisfiability problems, to work on problems with domains of any finite size. Second, we introduce a new method for transforming non-Boolean problems to Boolean problems and improve on an existing transformation. Third, we identify sufficient conditions for omitting at-least-one and at-most-one clauses from a transformed formula. Fourth, for use in our experiments we propose a model for generating random formulas that vary in domain size but are similar in other respects.	add-ons for firefox;algorithm;bart selman;boolean satisfiability problem;character encoding;direct method in the calculus of variations;domain engineering;eb-eye;effective method;experiment;hadamard transform;karp's 21 np-complete problems;local search (optimization);mathematical optimization;monte carlo method;naive bayes classifier;non-functional requirement;optimization problem;robustness (computer science);round-robin scheduling;scheduling (computing);solver;standard sea level;toby turner;unary coding;unary operation;undefined behavior;unique user;walksat	Alan M.

Starting with its introduction by Turán, we will discuss known results for complete and complete bipartite graphs. Then we will focus on some historical confusion on the crossing number that has been brought up by Pach and Tóth as well as Székely. A connection to computational geometry is made in the section on the geometric version, namely the rectilinear crossing number. We will also mention some applications of the crossing number to geometrical problems.

Sampling from a lattice Gaussian distribution is emerging as an important problem in various areas such as coding and cryptography. The default sampling algorithm - Klein's algorithm yields a distribution close to the lattice Gaussian only if the standard deviation is sufficiently large. In this paper, we propose the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for lattice Gaussian sampling when this condition is not satisfied. In particular, we present a sampling algorithm based on Gibbs sampling, which converges to the target lattice Gaussian distribution for any value of the standard deviation. To improve the convergence rate, a more efficient algorithm referred to as Gibbs-Klein sampling is proposed, which samples block by block using Klein's algorithm. We show that Gibbs-Klein sampling yields a distribution close to the target lattice Gaussian, under a less stringent condition than that of the original Klein algorithm.	algorithm;computer programming;cryptography;gibbs sampling;markov chain monte carlo;monte carlo method;rate of convergence;sampling (signal processing)	Zheng Wang;Cong Ling;Guillaume Hanrot	2014	2014 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2014.6875081	gaussian random field;metropolis–hastings algorithm;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;multiple-try metropolis;coupling from the past;gibbs sampling;hybrid monte carlo;markov chain monte carlo;importance sampling;slice sampling;mathematics;rejection sampling;umbrella sampling;gaussian function;hidden markov model;statistics;monte carlo method	Theory	42.136589594264976	13.335636829252575	19570

Given an input (R,V), where R is a 3dimensional (3D) bounded region and V a positive integer, find a packing of R using the minimum number of spheres (spheres may not be identical) such that the covered volume is at least V , and the number of points on the boundary ofR touched by spheres is maximized. Bourland and Wu (1996) and Wu (1996), devised a greedy algorithm to solve the problem based on medial axis analysis. In particular, the algorithm places the center of each sphere on the medial axis of each subsequent region starting from R. While this approach has met with certain success, we show that medial axis does not always provide optimal locations for min-max sphere packing.	apache axis;greedy algorithm;maxima and minima;medial graph;optic axis of a crystal;set packing	Jie Wang	2000	J.

The Fibonacci dimension of the resonance graphs of catacondensed benzenoid systems is studied. This study is inspired by the fact, that the Fibonacci cubes are precisely the resonance graphs of a subclass of the catacondensed benzenoid systems. Our results show that the Fibonacci dimension of the resonance graph of a catacondensed benzenoid system G depends on the inner dual of G. Moreover, we show that computing the Fibonacci dimension can be done in linear time for a graph of this class.	ccir system g;fibonacci cube;fibonacci heap;isometric projection;olap cube;resonance;time complexity	Aleksander Vesel	2013	Discrete Applied Mathematics	10.1016/j.dam.2013.03.019	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;fibonacci number;topology;mathematics;fibonacci cube;algorithm	Theory	28.219416195890595	31.367177539144166	19808

The noisy model of SDC protocol is constructed and the master equation that governs the SDC evolution is deduced. The success probabilities of SDC protocol are discussed for different locking operators under the influence of vacuum fluctuations. We find that the joint success probability is independent of the locking operators, but other success probabilities are not. For quantum Fourier transform and double controlled-NOT operators, the success probabilities drop with increasing two-atom distance, but SWAP operator is not. Unlike the SWAP operator, the success probabilities of Bob and Charlie are different. For different noisy interval values, different locking operators have different robustness to noise.

cffeff6d2dbb022263e18a9d55293b14f0f80e8d	on weak signal detection with compressive measurements		The problem of weak signal detection in Gaussian noise is addressed in the Neyman–Pearson framework with compressive measurements. A locally optimum detector is first devised assuming that the signal is nonsparse by approximating the test statistic around zero using a Taylor series, which is a good estimate only in a small radius around zero. When the signal is sparse, it is shown that the performance of this test degrades. To improve its performance, a new test is devised by deriving the Padé approximation of the test statistic around zero. Padé approximants estimate functions as the rational quotient of two lower degree polynomials and consistently have a wider radius of convergence than the Taylor series. The performance of the Padé-approximated test is better than its Taylor series counterpart and is comparable to the conventional locally optimum test with uncompressed measurements. Simulation results are presented to support the analytical findings of the work.	approximation algorithm;detection theory;padé approximant;polynomial;simulation;sparse matrix	Kyatsandra G.

These conditions specify the maximum number of emitters that can be uniquely located by a geolocation system, often referred to as the resolution capacity (RC). Our derivations extend previously published results for geolocation based on angle-of-arrival (AOA) estimation. We show that with no prior information, the RC is upper bounded by the total number of antenna elements in the system, i.e., LM, where M is the number of elements in each array and L is the number of arrays. In contrast, the RC of geolocation based on AOA is upper bounded by M. In addition, if the signals are known to be uncorrelated, and the arrays are uniform and linear, the RC is upper bounded by (LM)2-L(M-1)2-1. However, more emitters can be resolved using different types of arrays. Our results lead to the inevitable conclusion that geolocation based on AOA is suboptimal, and new methods should be developed that can jointly exploit the information collected by all the antenna arrays	angle of arrival;geolocation;radio frequency	Alon Amar;Anthony J.

10a3455324ab8bc80587f5bb013336180dc393a4	hierarchical clustering of asymmetric networks		This paper considers networks where relationships between nodes are represented by directed dissimilarities. The goal is to study methods that, based on the dissimilarity structure, output hierarchical clusters, i.e., a family of nested partitions indexed by a connectivity parameter. Our construction of hierarchical clustering methods is built around the concept of admissible methods, which are those that abide by the axioms of value – nodes in a network with two nodes are clustered together at the maximum of the two dissimilarities between them – and transformation – when dissimilarities are reduced, the network may become more clustered but not less. Two particular methods, termed reciprocal and nonreciprocal clustering, are shown to provide upper and lower bounds in the space of admissible methods. Furthermore, alternative clustering methodologies and axioms are considered. In particular, modifying the axiom of value such that clustering in two-node networks occurs at the minimum of the two dissimilarities entails the existence of a unique admissible clustering method.	cluster analysis;hierarchical clustering	Gunnar E.

S-PSO iteratively optimizes the objective function over randomly selected subspaces of the parameter search space instead of the entire parameter space at once as in standard PSO. This approach is advantageous since fewer particles are needed to solve the lower-dimension subproblems. S-PSO is applied to the distributed sonar sensor placement problem, where not only the dimensionality issue arises, but also the computational complexity of the objective function increases with the problem size. Simulations show that S-PSO outperforms standard PSO both in terms of convergence and computational efficiency.	analysis of algorithms;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;particle swarm optimization;randomness;sonar (symantec);vergence	Patrick N.

e7cb009b00762238266b0644cae23fcb7fac6a9a	the correlation error and finite-size correction in an ungapped sequence alignment	sequence alignment	MOTIVATION The BLAST program for comparing two sequences assumes independent sequences in its random model. The resulting random alignment matrices have correlations across their diagonals. Analytic formulas for the BLAST p-value essentially neglect these correlations and are equivalent to a random model with independent diagonals. Progress on the independent diagonals model has been surprisingly rapid, but the practical magnitude of the correlations it neglects remains unknown. In addition, BLAST uses a finite-size correction that is particularly important when either of the sequences being compared is short. Several formulas for the finite-size correction have now been given, but the corresponding errors in the BLAST p-values have not been quantified. As the lengths of compared sequences tend to infinity, it is also theoretically unknown whether the neglected correlations vanish faster than the finite-size correction.   RESULTS Because we required certain analytic formulas, our study restricted its computer experiments to ungapped sequence alignment. We expect some of our conclusions to extend qualitatively to gapped sequence alignment, however. With this caveat, the finite-size correction appeared to vanish faster than the neglected correlations. Although the finite-size correction underestimated the BLAST p-value, it improved the approximation substantially for all but very short sequences. In practice, the Altschul-Gish finite-size correction was superior to Spouge's. The independent diagonals model was always within a factor of 2 of the true BLAST p-value, although fitting p-value parameters from it probably is unwise.

For example, it is widely believed that social networks are fast mixing, and many recently proposed designs of such systems make crucial use of this property. However, whether real-world social networks are really fast mixing is not verified before, and this could potentially affect the performance of such systems based on the fast mixing property. To address this problem, we measure the mixing time of several social graphs, the time that it takes a random walk on the graph to approach the stationary distribution of that graph, using two techniques. First, we use the second largest eigenvalue modulus which bounds the mixing time. Second, we sample initial distributions and compute the random walk length required to achieve probability distributions close to the stationary distribution. Our findings show that the mixing time of social graphs is much larger than anticipated, and being used in literature, and this implies that either the current security systems based on fast mixing have weaker utility guarantees or have to be less efficient, with less security guarantees, in order to compensate for the slower mixing.	algorithm;distributed computing;fast flux;modulus robot;social graph;stationary process	Aziz Mohaisen;Aaram Yun;Yongdae Kim	2010		10.1145/1879141.1879191	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;statistics;social network	Metrics	37.1152932576308	13.98434074075616	20285

For interference avoidance, proper wireless interference identification (WII) is essential. In this work we propose the first WII approach based upon deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The CNN naively learns its features through self-optimization during an extensive data-driven GPU-based training process. We propose a CNN example which is based upon sensing snapshots with a limited duration of 12.8 μs and an acquisition bandwidth of 10 MHz. The CNN distinguishes between 15 classes. They represent packet transmissions of IEEE 802.11 b/g, IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.15.1 with overlapping frequency channels within the 2.4 GHz ISM band. We show that the CNN outperforms state-of-the-art WII approaches and has a classification accuracy greater than 95 % for signal-to-noise ratio of at least −5 dB.	artificial neural network;bluetooth;catastrophic interference;coexist (image);convolutional neural network;frequency band;graphics processing unit;implicit shape model;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;network packet;signal-to-noise ratio;wii	Malte Schmidt;Dimitri Block;Uwe Meier	2017	2017 IEEE 15th International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN)	10.1109/indin.2017.8104767	convolutional neural network;real-time computing;machine learning;wireless sensor network;signal processing;ism band;artificial neural network;deep learning;network packet;ieee 802.11b-1999;artificial intelligence;computer science	Embedded	35.043279269860626	9.258874270677314	20288
aa3bbcd48260417d2ba567acdde51d3ead75b4de	locality and bounding-box quality of two-dimensional space-filling curves		Space-filling curves can be used to organise points in the plane into bounding-box hierarchies (such as R-trees). We develop measures of the bounding-box quality of space-filling curves that express how effective different space-filling curves are for this purpose. We give general lower bounds on the bounding-box quality measures and on locality according to Gotsman and Lindenbaum for a large class of space-filling curves. We describe a generic algorithm to approximate these and similar quality measures for any given curve. Using our algorithm we find good approximations of the locality and the bounding-box quality of several known and new space-filling curves. Surprisingly, some curves with relatively bad locality by Gotsman and Lindenbaum’s measure, have good bounding-box quality, while the curve with the best-known locality has relatively bad bounding-box quality.	apache axis;apply;approximation algorithm;best, worst and average case;bounding volume hierarchy;data structure;experiment;generic programming;gosper curve;http 404;locality of reference;minimum bounding box;perimeter;point of view (computer hardware company);r* tree;recursion;regular grid;sorting;space-filling curve;subdivision surface;tiling window manager;why–because analysis	Herman J.

A cyclic coloring of a map G on a surface F 2 is a vertex-coloring of G such that any two vertices x and y receive different colors if x and y are incident with a common face of G. In this paper, we extend the result by Tait to two directions, that is, considering maps on a non-spherical surface and cyclic 4-colorings.	four color theorem;graph coloring;map	Atsuhiro Nakamoto;Kenta Noguchi;Kenta Ozeki	2016	Journal of Graph Theory	10.1002/jgt.21900	gallai–hasse–roy–vitaver theorem;mirsky's theorem;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;four color theorem;mathematics;greedy coloring	Theory	32.629189672528206	24.53054342329477	20322

A natural extension to this problem, emerging very recently in many reallife networks, is its fuzzification. The problem of finding the maximum clique in a fuzzy graph has been addressed in this paper. It has been shown here, that this problem reduces to an unconstrained quadratic 0-1 programming problem. Using a maximum neural network, along with, chaotic mutation capability of genetic algorithms, the reduced problem has been solved. Empirical studies have been done by applying the method on a gene co-expression network and on some benchmark graphs.	clique problem;software release life cycle	Sanghamitra Bandyopadhyay;Malay Bhattacharyya	2008		10.1007/978-3-642-02490-0_74	clique;block graph;maximum flow problem;mathematical optimization;maximum cut;split graph;combinatorics;clique graph;genetic algorithm;independent set;graph bandwidth;computer science;clique problem;graph theory;simplex graph;machine learning;subgraph isomorphism problem;mathematics;clique percolation method;induced subgraph isomorphism problem;maximum common subgraph isomorphism problem;treewidth;empirical research;artificial neural network;closure problem	AI	25.319411820351522	5.380131678459228	20341

All the formulae conform to a certain pattern with respect to the terms of the sum over t | n, t < n. Namely, these terms, which correspond to non-trivial automorphisms of the maps, prove to be of the form φ ( n t ) αrt (k t t ) , where φ(m) is the Euler function, k and r are integer constants and α is a constant or takes only two rational values. On the contrary, the main, “rooted” summand corresponding to t = n contains an additional factor which is a rational function of n. Two simple new enumerative results are deduced for bicolored eulerian maps. A collateral aim is to briefly survey recent and old results of unrooted planar map enumeration.	euler;map;planar graph	Valery A. Liskovets	2004	Electr. J.

In the fluctuating underwater environment, a complete set of pair-wise distance measurements can often be difficult to acquire, thus hindering a straightforward closed-form solution in deriving the assets’ relative coordinates. An iterative multidimensional scaling approach is presented based upon a weighted-majorization algorithm that tolerates missing or inaccurate distance measurements. Substantial modifications are proposed to optimize the algorithm, while the effects of refractive propagation paths are considered. A parametric study of the algorithm based upon simulation results is shown. An acoustic field-trial was then carried out, presenting field measurements to highlight the practical implementation of this algorithm.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;distance matrix;extrapolation;global positioning system;gradient;iterative method;multidimensional scaling;randomness;simulation;software propagation;velocity (software development);weatherstar;weight function	Kae Yeet Foo;Philip R.

Section 2B of that paper discusses the asymptotic properties of Bayes estimators. The result in that section is incorrectly stated in that the choice of n(~) in Eq. (13) depends upon the sequence Y~. Thus the argument there bounds the norm-square error for any sequence but does not represent an average over all sequences. In forthcoming article [Liporace, L. A.

We present a novel approach for sensor selection that utilizes a measure quantifying the incoherence of the vector space spanned by the sensors with respect to the system's principal directions. This approach provides a formulation of a convex relaxation problem that can be efficiently modeled and solved using compressed sensing (CS) algorithms. One of the key requirements in the theory of CS is that of a sufficiently incoherent sensing matrix. Such matrices are normally neither encountered in the sensor selection problem nor in many other engineering and scientific problems, which, to some extent, limits the applicability of the theory. In this work, this requirement is alleviated via the concept of semi-random sensing, where the standard sensing matrix pertaining to the problem at hand is deliberately contaminated by noise. We provide relations between the noise intensity and the incoherence properties of the contaminated sensing matrix. The viability of this concept is demonstrated and analyzed in the context of the sensor selection problem.	compressed sensing	Avishy Carmi;Pini Gurfil	2013	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2013.08.032	filter;mathematical optimization;engineering;artificial intelligence;machine learning;compressed sensing;statistics	HCI	48.9446009218811	7.719241053796455	20543

This yields an elegant generalized entropy matching estimator (G-EME).

For a pseudoBoolean function f(x) on {0, 1}n, we say that g(x, y) is a quadratization of f if g(x, y) is a quadratic polynomial depending on x and on m auxiliary binary variables y1, y2, . . . , ym such that f(x) = min{g(x, y) : y ∈ {0, 1}m} for all x ∈ {0, 1}n. By means of quadratizations, minimization of f is reduced to minimization (over its extended set of variables) of the quadratic function g(x, y). This is of practical interest because minimization of quadratic functions has been thoroughly studied for the last few decades, and much progress has been made in solving such problems exactly or heuristically. A related paper [1] initiated a systematic study of the minimum number of auxiliary y-variables required in a quadratization of an arbitrary function f (a natural question, since the complexity of minimizing the quadratic function g(x, y) depends, among other factors, on the number of binary variables). In this paper, we determine more precisely the number of auxiliary variables required by quadratizations of symmetric pseudo-Boolean functions f(x), those functions whose value depends only on the Hamming weight of the input x (the number of variables equal to 1).	existential quantification;hamming weight;heuristic;monomial;parity function;plate boundary observatory;polynomial;pseudo-boolean function;quadratic function;window function	Martin Anthony;Endre Boros;Yves Crama;Aritanan Gruber	2016	Discrete Applied Mathematics	10.1016/j.dam.2016.01.001	mathematical optimization;function composition;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;quadratic programming;algorithm;symmetric function	Theory	27.58084843397062	13.080781918906396	20565

The graph G is said to be connected if any two distinct vertices may be joined by a path. It is easy to see that if σ2(G) ≥ n − 1 then G is not only connected, but we can choose the connecting path to be of size at most two. Ore [4] proved that if σ2(G) ≥ n + 1 we may always choose this path to cover all the vertices of G. In this paper we extend these results to systems of vertex disjoint paths connecting two vertex k-sets of G.	graph (discrete mathematics);neighbourhood (graph theory);vertex (geometry)	Ronald J.

It has been shown that for a large class of random processes the rescaled logarithm of the guesswork satisfies the large deviation principle and this has been extended to the case where $k$ out $m$ sequences are guessed. The study of conditional guesswork, where guessing of a sequence is aided by the observation of another one, was initiated by Ar{\i}kan in his simple derivation of the upper bound of the cutoff rate for sequential decoding. In this note, we extend these large deviation results to the setting of conditional guesswork.	conditional entropy;sequential decoding;stochastic process	Jiange Li	2018	CoRR		mathematical analysis;cutoff;large deviations theory;statistics;logarithm;sequential decoding;mathematics;rate function;stochastic process;random variable;upper and lower bounds	ML	46.45686435650935	13.54345697017924	20768

In all these structures, the design of the optimum systems reduces to the optimization of a single function of a certain number of variables.

We develop a dynamic programming procedure to solve these problems and provide easy-to-verify conditions to characterize connectedness of switching and exercise regions. When the transition or Feynman-Kac semigroup of the Markov process has discrete spectrum, we develop an efficient algorithm based on eigenfunction expansions that explicitly solves the dynamic programming problem. We also prove that the algorithm converges exponentially in the series truncation level. Our method is applicable to a rich family of Markov processes which are widely used in financial applications, including many diffusions as well as jump-diffusions and pure jump processes that are constructed from diffusion through time change. In particular, many of these processes are often used to model mean-reversion. We illustrate the versatility of our method by considering three applications: valuation of combination shipping carriers, interest-rate chooser flexible caps and commodity swing options. Numerical examples show that our method is highly efficient and has significant computational advantages over standard numerical PDE methods that are typically used to solve such problems.	algorithm;computation;dynamic programming;java caps;markov property;numerical analysis;numerical method;optimal stopping;reversion (software development);truncation;value (ethics)	Lingfei Li;Xianjun Qu;Gongqiu Zhang	2016	J.

The results are derived using an information entropy approach in the context of limited precision integer weights. Such weights are particularly suited for hardware implementations since the area they occupy is limited, and the computations performed with them can be efficiently implemented in hardware. The considerations presented use an information entropy perspective and calculate lower bounds on the number of bits needed in order to solve a given classification problem. These bounds are obtained by approximating the classification hypervolumes with the volumes of several regular (i.e., highly symmetric) n-dimensional bodies. The bounds given here allow the user to choose the appropriate size of a neural network such that: (i) the given classification problem can be solved, and (ii) the network architecture is not oversized. All considerations presented take into account the restrictive case of limited precision integer weights, and therefore can be directly applied when designing VLSI implementations of neural networks.	algorithm;artificial neural network;ball project;bounding volume hierarchy;computation;computer hardware;entropy (information theory);network architecture;very-large-scale integration	Valeriu Beiu;Sorin Draghici;Thierry de Pauw	1999	Neural Processing Letters	10.1023/A:1018659009494	entropy;combinatorics;image processing;information theory;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;artificial neural network;algorithm;statistics	ML	33.41567273958686	13.829638891439279	20991

So as to obtain a common framework for these models, here we introduce broad and complementary models for linear stochastic flow and synchronization dynamics in networks, that are structured only in that the network's state evolution is Markov and conditionally linear. We first provide mathematical and graphical formulations for each model, and then verify that the models are broad enough to capture several common synchronization/flow networks. As a first analysis, graph-theoretic characterizations of these models' asymptotics are given; these results generalize and enhance known graphical characterizations of existing synchronization/flow models. A comparison of the stochasticity of different flow network models within the framework is also included.	flow network;graph theory;markov chain;synchronization (computer science)	Mengran Xue;Sandip Roy	2011	Proceedings of the 2011 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC)		stochastic process;synchronization;combinatorics;computer science;graph theory;theoretical computer science;machine learning;mathematics;markov process;statistics	Metrics	42.27680872485191	8.25073897505109	21009

We will prove that ifG = (V1, V2, E) is a bipartite graph with |V1| = |V2| = n ≥ 2k+ 1 and δ(G) ≥ dn/2e+ 1, thenG contains a 2-factor with exactly k components.

To do that we define first what we consider as molecular pseudosymmetry and the relationships of this concept with those of approximate symmetry and quasisymmetry. We develop a general algorithm to quantify the pseudosymmetry content of a given object within the framework of the finite group algebra. The obtained mathematical expressions are able to decompose molecular orbitals by means of the irreducible representations of any reference symmetry point group. The implementation and usefulness of the pseudosymmetry analysis of molecular orbitals is demonstrated in the study of σ and π orbitals in planar and nonplanar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and the t2 g and eg character of the d-orbitals in the [FeH6](3-) anion in its high spin state along the Bailar twist pathway.

In the case of planar objects, it is the width of the narrowest infinite strip that completely contains the object. The width of a planar point set can be found from its convex hull by a simple linear time algorithm that sweeps through all possible slopes, finding the points of tangency of the two supporting lines for each slope [8,12]. Despite several attempts, no satisfactory data structure is known for maintaining the width dynamically, as the points undergo insertions and deletions. Janardan, Rote, Schwarz, and Snoeyink [9,13,14] maintain only an approximation to the true width. Agarwal and Sharir [3] solve the decision problem (is the width less than a fixed bound?) and require the entire update sequence to be known in advance. Agarwal et al. [l] maintain the exact width, but use superlinear time per update (however note that this algorithm allows the points to move continuously as well as undergoing insertions and deletions). Finally, our previous paper [5] provides a fully dynamic algorithm for the exact width, but is efficient only in the average case, for random update sequences. In this paper we present an algorithm for maintaining the exact width dynamically. Our algorithm takes time O&P) per update, where k is the amount of change the update causes in the convex hull, n is the number of points in the set, and E is any arbitrarily small constant. In particular, for incremental updates (insertions only) or decremental updates (deletions only), the total change to the convex hull can be at most linear and the algorithm takes 0 (n”) amortized time per update. For the randomized model of our previous paper, the expected value of k is 0 ( 1) and the average case time per update of our algorithm is again 0 (n’). Our approach is to use a data structure of the author [4,6,7] for maintaining the minimum of a bivariate function defined on a dynamic set of objects. The width can be defined as such a minimum of a function defined on the features of the point set’s convex hull. To apply this approach, we need data structures for dynamic nearest neighbor querying on subsets of features; we build these data structures by combining binary search trees with a data structure of Agarwal and MatouSek for ray shooting in convex polyhedra [2].	amortized analysis;approximation;best, worst and average case;bivariate data;convex hull;data structure;decision problem;dynamic problem (algorithms);langrisser schwarz;polyhedron;randomized algorithm;ray casting;time complexity	David Eppstein	1999		10.1006/jagm.2000.1107	convex analysis;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;complexity;computational geometry;convex hull;mathematics;geometry;scheduling;approximation algorithm;algorithm;set theory	Theory	29.490614639652936	17.54905064188819	21295

The two basic paradigms, trust-region and line-search methods, are briefly described. In addition, various nonlinear optimization techniques are reviewed. The application of these nonlinear optimization methods to circuit sizing is presented by describing a pair of circuit sizing tools, one for dynamic tuning and one for tuning based on static timing analysis.

These notions are analogous to and can be considered as natural generalizations of notions of competition graph and competition number that arise from problems of ecology. Given an acyclic digraph D = (V;A), de ne its phylogeny graph G = P (D) by taking the same vertex set as D and, for x 6= y, letting xy 2 E(G) if and only if (x; y) 2 A or (y; x) 2 A or (x; a); (y; a) 2 A for some vertex a 2 V . Given a graph G = (V;E), we shall call the acyclic digraph D a phylogeny digraph for G if G is an induced subgraph of P (D) and D has no arcs from vertices outside of G to to vertices in G. The phylogeny number p(G) is de ned to be the smallest r such that G has a phylogeny digraph D with jV (D)j jV (G)j = r. In this paper, we obtain results about phylogeny number for graphs with exactly two triangles analogous to those for competition number. 1 Phylogeny Graphs and Phylogeny Numbers The notions of competition graph and competition number were introduced by Cohen [1] and Roberts [7], respectively, to model problems in ecology, and there has since developed an extensive literature on these subjects. In Roberts and Sheng [10], we introduced related notions called phylogeny graph and phylogeny number, motivated in part by problems of phylogenetic tree reconstruction, and presented results analogous to a number of well-known results about competition graphs and competition numbers. In this paper, we calculate the phylogeny number for graphs with exactly two triangles, analogous to similar results of Kim and Roberts [4] about competition numbers. Suppose D = (V;A) is a digraph, where V is the vertex set and A the set of directed arcs. We adopt the graph-theoretical notation and terminology of Roberts [9], unless otherwise noted. The competition graph K(D) is the undirected graph (V;E) with the same vertex set as D and with xy 2 E , (9a 2 V )[(x; a) 2 A & (y; a) 2 A] (1) In the ecological application introduced by Cohen, D represents the food web for species in the vertex set V , where an arc from u to v means that u preys on v. Then there is an edge between x and y in the competition graph if and only if x and y have a common prey. Food webs are usually acyclic, and the study of competition graphs has often been restricted to the competition graphs of acyclic digraphs. Competition graphs also arise in connection with communication over noisy channels, radio and television transmission, and models of complex economic and energy problems { see Raychaudhuri and Roberts [6] and Roberts [8] for a discussion of these applications. Roberts [7] observed that if G is any graph, then G together with su ciently many isolated vertices is a competition graph of some acyclic digraph, and de ned the competition number k(G) to be the smallest number of such isolated vertices. Characterizing competition graphs of acyclic digraphs is thus equivalent to calculating competition numbers of arbitrary graphs. See Lundgren [5] for a survey of the extensive literature of competition graphs and competition numbers. Given an acyclic digraph D = (V;A), its phylogeny graph P (D) is the undirected graph (V;E) with the same vertex set as D and with xy 2 E , (9a 2 V )[(x; a) 2 A & (y; a) 2 A] or [(x; y) 2 A] or [(y; x) 2 A] (2) Given G = (V;E), by adding a set Ik of k vertices, we can always build an acyclic digraph D with V (D) = V [ Ik such that for all x; y 2 V , xy 2 E , (9a 2 V [ Ik))[(x; a) 2 A(D) & (y; a) 2 A(D)] or [(x; y) 2 A(D)] or [(y; x) 2 A(D)] (3) Simply add a new vertex (x; y) for each edge xy in G, with arcs from x and y to (x; y). Note that P (D) can have edges in between some vertices of G and added vertices. However, in D we do not have arcs from added vertices to vertices in G. Any acyclic digraph D for { 2 { which Equation (3) holds and such that D has no arcs from vertices outside of G to G is called a phylogeny digraph for G. The phylogeny number p(G) of G is the smallest r so that G has a phylogeny digraph D with jV (D) V (G)j = r. A phylogeny digraph D for G for which jV (D) V (G)j = p(G) is called an optimal phylogeny digraph for G. Some of the most helpful results in the theory of competition graphs, results that give rise to explicit formulas for the competition number and therefore are useful for making calculations and for developing and checking conjectures, are those for graphs with a small number of triangles. Results for the case of zero, one or two triangles were obtained by Kim and Roberts [4]. In [10], we obtained analogous results for phylogeny number for graphs with zero or one triangle. In this paper, we give analogous results for the case of two triangles. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we list some results about the phylogeny numbers for graphs with zero or one triangle that will be used in this paper. Section 3 deals with the phylogeny numbers for graphs with two triangles which share one of their edges. In Section 4, we calculate p(G) for graphs with two triangles that are edgedisjoint. 2 Preliminaries An edge clique cover of G is a collection of cliques that covers all edges of G, and a vertex clique cover of G is a collection of cliques that covers all vertices of G. We will denote by e(G) or simply e the edge clique cover number, i.e., the minimum number of cliques in an edge clique cover. The vertex clique cover number (G) is de ned similarly. We will denote by n(G) or simply n the number of vertices in G, and e(G) or simply e the number edges of G. If G is a graph, NG(x) = N(x) = fy : xy 2 E(G)g is the open neighborhood of vertex x in G, and NG[x] = N [x] = N(x)[fxg is the closed neighborhood of x. By abuse of notation, we also use N(x) and N [x] to denote the subgraph induced by these sets. If G1 = (V1; E1) and G2 = (V2; E2) are two graphs, we will denote G1 [G2 = (V1 [ V2; E1 [ E2). The union of two digraphs is de ned accordingly. Theorem 1 (Harary, Norman and Cartwright [3]) Let D = (V;A) be a digraph. Then D is acyclic if and only if there exists an ordering of vertices, = [v1; v2; ; vn], such that one of the following two conditions holds, (1) For all i; j 2 [1; n], (vi; vj) 2 A implies that i < j. (2) For all i; j 2 [1; n], (vi; vj) 2 A implies that i > j. If D is a phylogeny digraph for G = (V;E), we can write D = (V [ Im; A), where Im is the set of vertices of D not in G and, by notational convention throughout, will be assumed to have m vertices in it. The following results from [10] will be needed here. Lemma 2 (Roberts and Sheng [10]) For any graph G = (V;E), p(G) e n+ 1. { 3 { Lemma 3 (Roberts and Sheng [10]) Given a graph G = (V;E), let G1; G2; : : : ; Gm be the connected components of G and let Di be an optimal phylogeny digraph for Gi; i = 1; 2; ;m. Then D = D1 [ D2 [ [ Dm is an optimal phylogeny digraph for G and p(G) = p(G1) + p(G2) + + p(Gm). Given G = (V;E), let D = (V [ Im; A) be a phylogeny digraph for G and let e = uv 2 E. We say that e is oriented in D if (u; v) 2 A or (v; u) 2 A. We say e is taken care of by a vertex a in V [ Im if (u; a) 2 A and (v; a) 2 A. In the case a 2 V , we sometimes say that e is taken care of by edges ua and va or say a is the common ancestor for the triangle with vertex set fu; v; ag, and in the case a 62 V , we say that e is taken care of by some added ancestor a. If E1 E, we will let E1 = E E1. A triangle is a mixed triangle relative to E1 if some edge of the triangle is in E1 and some edge of the triangle is in E1. In the rest of this paper, we will intensively use the following notation. GivenG = (V;E), we will let E be the subset of E obtained by deleting all the triangle edges from E, and we will let G = (V;E ). Let D = (V [Im; A) be an optimal phylogeny digraph for G = (V;E), and let G1 = (V1; E1) be a subgraph of G. We will denote byDjG1 the subgraph ofD induced by vertices of G1 and vertices from Im that take care of some edges in E1. Im1 is the set of m1 vertices in Im that take care of some edges in E1. Denote AjE1 = f(u; v) 2 A : uv 2 E1g, AjIm1 = f(u; a) 2 A : u 2 V; a 2 Im1g, A1 = AjE1 [ AjIm1 . Then DjG1 = (V1 [ Im1; A1). Lemma 4 (Roberts and Sheng [10]) Suppose G = (V;E), let E1 E and G1 = (V;E1). Let D = (V [ Im; A) be an optimal phylogeny digraph for G and let Im1 be the set of m1 vertices in Im that only take care of edges in E1. If G has no mixed triangles, then p(G) p(G1) +m1 p(G1) + p(G1). Suppose D = (V;A) is a digraph and W V . We say W is shielded (in D) if each vertex of W has at most one incoming arc in D. We shall call the orientation D = (V;A) of G a free orientation of G if D is acyclic and V is shielded in D. A source for a digraph D is a vertex that has no incoming arcs in D. Lemma 5 (Roberts and Sheng [10]) If G = (V;E) is a graph with no triangles and with k connected components, then p(G) = e n + k. Moreover, if x is an arbitrary vertex of G, there is an optimal phylogeny digraph for G with x a source vertex and with V shielded. The results of [10] that we extend to the case of two triangles are the following. Theorem 6 (Roberts and Sheng [10]) If G = (V;E) is a connected graph with no triangles, then p(G) = e n + 1. Theorem 7 (Roberts and Sheng [10]) Let G = (V;E) be a connected graph with exactly one triangle. Then p(G) = ( e n if G has three components e n 1 if G has one or two components. { 4 { 3 Phylogeny Number for Graphs with Two Triangles that Share One of their Edges Assume that the connected graph G = (V;E) has exactly two triangles. In this section, we consider the case when these two triangle share one of their edges. In this case, we denote the vertex set for the two triangles by x; u; v and y; u; v respectively, with uv being their common edge. It is easy to see that G has at most four components. We say a graph G = (V;E) is separable by a vertex w 2 V into two subgraphs G1 = (V1; E1) and G2 = (V2; E2) if V = V1 [ V2 and E = E1 [ E2 are such that V1 \ V2 = f	bayesian inference in phylogeny;care-of address;clique cover;connectivity (graph theory);directed acyclic graph;directed graph;ecology;emoticon;execution unit;frank harary;graph (discrete mathematics);induced subgraph;intersection number (graph theory);phylogenetic tree;prey;vertex (graph theory)	Fred S.

We relate this dimension to the weight of the maximal interior segments of the T-mesh, defined for an ordering of these maximal interior segments. We show that the lower and upper bounds coincide, for high enough degrees or for hierarchical T-meshes which are enough regular. We give a rule of subdivision to construct hierarchical T-meshes for which these lower and upper bounds coincide. Finally, we illustrate these results by analyzing spline spaces of small degrees and smoothness.	b-spline;bivariate data;maximal set;polynomial;spline (mathematics);subdivision surface	Bernard Mourrain	2014	Math.

We consider the case where data are drawn from sampling a probability distribution that has support on or near a submanifold of Euclidean space. We show how to “learn” the homology of the submanifold with high confidence. We discuss an algorithm to do this and provide learning-theoretic complexity bounds. Our bounds are obtained in terms of a condition number that limits the curvature and nearness to self-intersection of the submanifold. We are also able to treat the situation where the data are “noisy” and lie near rather than on the submanifold in question.	algorithm;condition number;homology (biology);homology modeling;sampling (signal processing);theory	Partha Niyogi;Stephen Smale;Shmuel Weinberger	2008	Discrete & Computational Geometry	10.1007/s00454-008-9053-2	probability distribution;sampling;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;topology;euclidean space;condition number;submanifold;mathematics;geometry;data analysis	Theory	39.97928254115026	18.90281304857292	21485

294e6e9e4302f9b07396d7050264cd5c4cf65abf	the search for chromatically unique graphs - ii	chromatically unique graph	The number of vertex-colourings of a simple graphG in not more thanλ colours is a polynomial inλ. This polynomial, denoted byP(G, λ), is called the chromatic polynomial ofG. A graphG is said to be chromatically unique, in shortχ-unique, ifH ≅ G for any graphH withP(H, λ) = P(G, λ). Since the appearance of the first paper onχ-unique graphs by Chao and Whitehead in 1978, various families of and several results on such graphs have been obtained successively, especially during the last five years. It is the aim of this expository paper to give a survey on most of the works done onχ-unique graphs. A number of related problems and conjectures are also included.		K. M. Koh;Kee L.

08d4bda740cebd71087d1e07da062010a0200d2f	concept of a vertex in a matroid and 3-connected graphs	connected graph	The concept of a matroid vertex is introduced. The vertices of a matroid of a 3-connected graph are in one-to-one correspondence with vertices of the graph. Thence directly follows Whitney’s theorem that cyclic isomorphism of 3-connected graphs implies isomorphism. The concept of a vertex of a matroid leads to an equally simple proof of Whitney’s theorem on the unique embedding of a 3-connected planar graph in the sphere. It also leads to a number of new facts about 3-connected graphs. Thus, consideration of a vertex in a matroid that is the dual of the matroid of a graph leads to a natural concept of a nonseparating cycle of a graph. Whitney’s theorem on cyclic isomorphism can be strengthened (even if the nonseparating cycles of a graph are considered, the theorem is found to work) and a new criterion for planarity of 3-connected graphs is obtained (in terms of nonseparating cycles).	matroid;one-to-one (data model);planar graph;vertex (geometry);vertex (graph theory)	Alexander K.

8461ead46721eef5893493009cdfbaebb807f416	on positive-influence target-domination	positive influence;target dominating;social networks	Consider a graph G = (V, E) and a vertex subset A ⊆ V . A vertex v is positive-influence dominated by A if either v is in A or at least half the number of neighbors of v belong to A. For a target vertex subset S ⊆ V , a vertex subset A is a positive-influence target-dominating set for target set S if every vertex in S is positive-influence dominated by A. Given a graph G and a target vertex subset S, the positive-influence target-dominating set (PITD) problem is to find the minimum positive-influence dominating set for target S. In this paper, we show two results: (1) The PITD problem has a polynomial-time (1 + log 3 2 )-approximation in general graphs where is the maximum vertex-degree of the input graph. (2) For target set S with |S| = (|V |), the PITD problem has a polynomial-time O(1)-approximation in power-law graphs.

The first one gives a lower bound for the Euler characteristic of a tight combinatorial 4-manifold M under the additional assumptions that |M | is 1-connected, that M is a subcomplex of H(M), and that H(M) is a centrally symmetric and simplicial d-polytope. The second inequality relates the Euler characteristic with the number of vertices of a combinatorial 4-manifold admitting a fixed-point free involution. Furthermore, we construct a new and highly symmetric 12-vertex triangulation of S2 × S2 realizing equality in each of these inequalities.	euler characteristic;social inequality	E.

We study the generalized product on the bipolar scale[−1, 1], stressing the axiomatic point of view ( compare also [9]). Based on newly introduced bipolar properties, such as the bipolar increasingness , bipolar unit element, bipolar idempotent element, several kinds of generalized b polar product are introduced and studied. A special stress is put on bipolar s emicopulas, bipolar quasi-copulas and bipolar copulas. Inspired by the truncate d sum on [−1, 1] we introduce also the class of generalized bipolar sums, which differ fro m uninorms due to the non-associativity.	aggregate function;idempotence;truncation	Salvatore Greco;Radko Mesiar;Fabio Rindone	2016	FO & DM	10.1007/s10700-015-9217-5	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics	Theory	45.501873141458944	25.826500448722474	21736
47d25ad0a8c55df69069b5a1de78fa50aaa35f58	an efficient and simple polygon intersection algorithm	simple polygon intersection algorithm	Introduction In a plygon intersection algorithm an edge of a polygon is divided into a list of segments. These segments can be classitled as In, On, or Out with respect to the other polygon. In Boolean cqxmtiom on two polygons degeneracies occur if the polygons have common edge fragments or touching vertices. lrt the absence of any degeneracy there would be no On case and the In and the Out segments would alternate. We divide the edgea into segments in such a way that the above condition holds even in the presence of degetteracies. IIt the computation of the intersection polygon this involves cutting the edge only when the other edge is timing from its left. We show that this strategy makes any special coding to handle degenerate cases completely unnecessary. Since the In and the Out segments alterrtat~ knowing the status of only one segment cao help find the status of all other segments of the same edge without any further test.	computation;degeneracy (graph theory);degenerate energy levels;intersection algorithm	Maharaj Mukherjee	1991		10.1145/112515.112587	complex polygon;visibility polygon;shoelace formula;simple polygon;rectilinear polygon;star-shaped polygon;affine-regular polygon;monotone polygon;polygon covering;polygon triangulation;pick's theorem	Graphics	34.24087563551977	23.386732594076346	21747

In this paper we focus on a natural generalization of this problem, the little Grothendieck problem over the orthogonal group. Given C ∈ ℝ dn × dn a positive semidefinite matrix, the objective is to maximize [Formula: see text] restricting Oi to take values in the group of orthogonal matrices [Formula: see text], where Cij denotes the (ij)-th d × d block of C. We propose an approximation algorithm, which we refer to as Orthogonal-Cut, to solve the little Grothendieck problem over the group of orthogonal matrices [Formula: see text] and show a constant approximation ratio. Our method is based on semidefinite programming. For a given d ≥ 1, we show a constant approximation ratio of αℝ(d)2, where αℝ(d) is the expected average singular value of a d × d matrix with random Gaussian [Formula: see text] i.i.d. entries. For d = 1 we recover the known αℝ(1)2 = 2/π approximation guarantee for the classical little Grothendieck problem. Our algorithm and analysis naturally extends to the complex valued case also providing a constant approximation ratio for the analogous little Grothendieck problem over the Unitary Group [Formula: see text]. Orthogonal-Cut also serves as an approximation algorithm for several applications, including the Procrustes problem where it improves over the best previously known approximation ratio of [Formula: see text]. The little Grothendieck problem falls under the larger class of problems approximated by a recent algorithm proposed in the context of the non-commutative Grothendieck inequality. Nonetheless, our approach is simpler and provides better approximation with matching integrality gaps. Finally, we also provide an improved approximation algorithm for the more general little Grothendieck problem over the orthogonal (or unitary) group with rank constraints, recovering, when d = 1, the sharp, known ratios.	accidental falls;approximation algorithm;generalization (psychology);large;matching;normal statistical distribution;osteogenesis imperfecta;semidefinite programming;singular;social inequality	Afonso S.

This paper presents a design exploration of a new EEG-based embedded system for home devices control. Two main issues are addressed in this work: the first one consists of an adaptive filter design to increase the classification accuracy for motor imagery. The second issue deals with the design of an efficient hardware/software embedded architeclture integrating the entire EEG signal processing chain. In this embedded system organization, the pre-processing techniques, which are time consuming, are integrated as hardware accelerators. The remaining blocks (Intellectual Properties - IP) are developed as embedded-software running on an embedded soft-core processor. The pre-processing step is designed to be self-adjusted according to the intrinsic characteristics of each subject. The feature extraction process uses the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) as a filter due to its effectiveness to extract the ERD/ERS (Event-Related Desynchronization/ Synchronization) effect, where the classifier is based on the Mahalanobis distance. The advantage of the proposed system lies in its simplicity and short processing time while maintaining a high performance in term of classification accuracy. A prototype of the embedded system has been implemented on an Altera FPGA-based platform (Stratix-IV). It is shown that the proposed architecture can effectively extract discriminative features for motor imagery with a maximum frequency of 150 MHz. The proposed system was validated on EEG data of twelve subjects from the BCI competition data sets. The prototype performs a fast classification within time delay of 0.399 second per trial, an accuracy average of 94.47 %, an average transfer rate over all subjects of 20.74 bits/min. The estimated power consumption of the proposed system is around 1.067 Watt (based on an integrated tool-power analysis of Altera corporation).	electroencephalography;prototype	Kais Belwafi;Ghaffari Fakhreddine;Ridha Djemal;Olivier Romain	2017	Signal Processing Systems	10.1007/s11265-016-1192-8	artificial intelligence;field-programmable gate array;machine learning;parallel computing;system on a chip;real-time computing;computer hardware;real-time operating system;synchronization;signal processing;software;feature extraction;adaptive filter;computer science	OS	33.019711284146645	9.42240703764388	21941

This is a nonlinear process which introduces distortion. We develop a Bayesian, model-based approach to reducing the quantisation distortion when moving a time series, such as an audio signal, to a higher resolution medium. The signal is modelled as a discrete-time, continuous-valued a toregressive (AR) process of unknown order. The model parameters and reconstructed signal are estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. This requires samples to be drawn from a truncated multivariate Gaussian distribution, for which a Metropoli sHastings approach is developed. 1. QUANTISATION DISTORTION For digital processing, transmission, or storage, a signal is represented as discrete in both time (due to sampling) and value (due to quantisation). The quantisation process intr oduces an error component, often referred to as ‘quantisatio n noise’. Since this quantisation error is signal-dependent , it is perhaps better described as quantisation distortion. The distortion consists of a series of added harmonics, together with aliased images of them. For complicated signals, this can be quite innocuous, behaving very much like white noise. When the signal is simple, however, the structure becomes clear. Furthermore, the relative levels of the added harmonics (and their inharmonic aliases) vary signif icantly with small changes in the level of the input signal. This behaviour can be disturbing in music signals, especially with those instruments, such as pianos, whose note waveforms become more sinusoidal as they decay. This effect produces what is known as ‘granulation noise’ [1]. Quantisation occurs both during analogue-to-digital conversion and during any subsequent manipulation of the digital signal that increases the word length, such as multi plication. This work is supported by the Engineering & Physical Science s R search Council, U.K. e AR k,a x y Q(·) Figure 1: Modelling of quantised signal: e is the excitation process, x the undistorted signal, and y the observed, quantised signal. Although there has been much research into the effects of quantisation and their elimination at the time of quantis ation through the use of dither (see [2] for a comprehensive survey), there does not appear to be any published work on reconstructing an unknown signal, such as audio, when only a coarsely quantised version is available. 2. MODELLING FRAMEWORK As shown in figure 1, we model the signal and the quantisation process explicitly.

Aronov et al. [2008] prove that, if one makes certain realistic input assumptions on the terrain, this complexity is Θ(n+m&sqrt;n) in the worst case, where n denotes the number of triangles that define the terrain and m denotes the number of Voronoi sites. We prove that, under a relaxed set of assumptions, the Voronoi diagram has expected complexity O(n+m), given that the sites are sampled uniformly at random from the domain of the terrain (or the surface of the terrain). Furthermore, we present a construction of a terrain that implies a lower bound of Ω(nm2/3) on the expected worst-case complexity if these assumptions on the terrain are dropped. As an additional result, we show that the expected fatness of a cell in a random planar Voronoi diagram is bounded by a constant.	best, worst and average case;boris aronov;polyhedral terrain;polyhedron;probabilistic analysis of algorithms;voronoi diagram;worst-case complexity	Anne Driemel;Sariel Har-Peled;Benjamin Raichel	2012	ACM Trans.

Let fs(G) for 0 ≤ s ≤ α(G) denote the number of independent sets of s vertices in G. The independence polynomial I(G; x) = α(G) i=0 fs(G)x s defined first by Gutman and Harary has been the focus of considerable research recently. Motivated by a result of Gutman for some compound graphs, we extend the result for more general compound graphs. In particular, we use our main results to determine the coefficients fs(G) for some well-covered graphs and present the exact independence polynomials of several well-covered graphs. Using the independence polynomials we derive some interesting combinatorial identities and give exact values of the Merrifield–Simmons index for some special classes of graphs. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We give in this paper a contribution to the study of some classes of trellises introduced by Culik, Gruska, and Salomaa by solving a natural question about these objects. The characteristic functions of rational subsets of N , are shown to be sub-markovian B-mappings and also sub-modular B-mappings for every square modulus (p; p), where p is a positive integer.

A subset D of V is a paired-dominating set of G, if D is a dominating set and the subgraph induced by the vertices of D contains a perfect matching. A set D of a vertices in a graph G = (V, E) is said to be a total dominating set of G if every vertex in V is adjacent to some vertex in D. The total bondage number bt(G) of G is the minimum number of edges whose removal enlarges the total domination number. In this paper we determine the domination number, paired-domination number, bondage number and the total bondage number for coronene torus using H-packing.	dominating set	Jasintha Quadras;Sajiya Merlin Mahizl Albert	2015	Mathematics in Computer Science	10.1007/s11786-015-0222-4	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;independent set;topology;dominating set;cycle graph;vertex;mathematics;bound graph;neighbourhood	Theory	28.287947749137636	28.183384496658736	22239

For n 2 2, the Steiner n-eccentricity e,(v) of a vertex u of a graph G is the maximum Steiner distance among all sets S of n vertices of G that contain u . The Steiner n-center of G is the subgraph induced by those vertices of G having minimum n-eccentricity. The Steiner n-distance of a vertex u of G is defined as dg’(v) = x{d(S)IS C V(G), u E Sand 1.51 = n}. The Steiner n-median of G is the subgraph of G induced by the vertices of G of minimum Steiner n-distance. Known algorithms for finding the Steiner n-centers and Steiner n-medians of trees are used to show that the distance between the Steiner n-center and Steiner n-median of a tree can be arbitrarily large. Centrality measures that allow every vertex on a shortest path from the Stei.ner n-center to the Steiner n-median of a tree to belong to the ”center” with respect to one of these measures are introduced and several properties of these centrality measures are established.	algorithm;centrality;connectivity (graph theory);distance (graph theory);graph (discrete mathematics);rectilinear steiner tree;shortest path problem;steiner tree problem;vertex (geometry)	Ortrud R.

We compu te the degrees of standard procedures of evaluating these predicates. The degrees of some of these procedure s are surprisingly high (up to 168), which may explain why computing line transversals with finite-precision floating-point a rithmetic is prone to error. Our results suggest the need to explore alternatives to the standard methods of comp uting these quantities.	categorization;standard operating procedure	Hazel Everett;Sylvain Lazard;William J.

We also consider “Fragmentable” classes of graphs (an example is the class of planar graphs) which are, roughly speaking, graphs which can be decomposed into bounded sized components by removing a small proportion of the vertices. We show that for such graphs of bounded degree the harmonious chromatic number is close to the lower bound (2m) 1 2 , where m is the number of edges.	graph coloring;planar graph	Keith Edwards;Colin McDiarmid	1994	Journal of Graph Theory	10.1002/jgt.3190180305	1-planar graph;pathwidth;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;chordal graph;indifference graph	Theory	28.07499836128022	25.937382233602598	22400

First, we prove a Euclidean distance duality, distinct from classical separation theorems such as Farkas Lemma: p lies in conv(S) if and only if for each p′ ∈ conv(S) there exists a pivot, vj ∈ S satisfying d(p′, vj) ≥ d(p, vj). Equivalently, p 6∈ conv(S) if and only if there exists a witness, p′ ∈ conv(S) whose Voronoi cell relative to p contains S. A witness separates p from conv(S) and approximate d(p, conv(S)) to within a factor of two. Next, we describe the Triangle Algorithm: given ǫ ∈ (0, 1), an iterate, p′ ∈ conv(S), and v ∈ S, if d(p, p′) < ǫd(p, v), it stops. Otherwise, if there exists a pivot vj , it replace v with vj and p ′ with the projection of p onto the line p′vj . Repeating this process, the algorithm terminates in O(mnmin{ǫ, c ln ǫ}) arithmetic operations, where c is the visibility factor, a constant satisfying c ≥ ǫ and sin(∠pp′vj) ≤ 1/ √ 1 + c, over all iterates p′. In particular, the geometry of the input data may result in efficient complexities such as O(mn t √ ǫ ln ǫ), t a natural number, or even O(mn ln ǫ). Additionally, (i) we prove a strict distance duality and a related minimax theorem, resulting in more effective pivots; (ii) describe O(mn ln ǫ)-time algorithms that may compute a witness or a good approximate solution; (iii) prove generalized distance duality and describe a corresponding generalized Triangle Algorithm; (iv) prove a sensitivity theorem to analyze the complexity of solving LP feasibility via the Triangle Algorithm. The Triangle Algorithm is practical and competitive with the simplex method, sparse greedy approximation and first-order methods. Finally, we discuss future work on applications and generalizations.	approximation algorithm;cell (microprocessor);computation;computational geometry;convex hull;emoticon;euclidean distance;farkas' lemma;first-order predicate;greedy algorithm;iteration;linear programming;minimax theorem;pivot table;simplex algorithm;sparse matrix;voronoi diagram	Bahman Kalantari	2015	Annals OR	10.1007/s10479-014-1707-2	minimax;frank–wolfe algorithm;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;duality;linear programming;convex hull;calculus;mathematics	Theory	26.481647478980143	15.667117797011375	22413

The approximation utilizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence as a distance measure. The stationarity condition for optimality requires that the approximant matches n+1 covariance moments of the given power spectrum and m cepstral moments of the corresponding logarithm, although the latter with possible slack. The solution coincides with one derived by Byrnes, Enqvist, and Lindquist who addressed directly the question of covariance and cepstral matching. Thus, the present paper provides an approximation theoretic justification of such a problem. Since the approximation requires only moments of spectral densities and of their logarithms, it can also be used for system identification.	approximation algorithm;cepstrum;convex optimization;kullback–leibler divergence;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;program optimization;slack variable;spectral density;stationary process;system identification;theory	Tryphon T.

The  b -chromatic number of  G  is the greatest integer  k  such that  G  admits a  b -coloring with  k  colors. A graph  G  is  m -tight if it has exactly   m  =  m  (  G  )   vertices of degree exactly   m  −  1  , where   m  (  G  )   is the largest integer  m  such that  G  has at least  m  vertices of degree at least   m  −  1  . Determining the  b -chromatic number of a  m -tight graph  G  is NP-hard [Jan Kratochvil, Zsolt Tuza, and Margit Voigt. On the  b -chromatic number of graphs. In Proc. of the 28th International Workshop on Graph-Theoretic Concepts in Computer Science, pages 310–320. Springer-Verlag, 2002]. In this paper, we define the  b -closure and the partial  b -closure of a  m -tight graph. These concepts were used to give a characterization of  m -tight graphs whose  b -chromatic number is equal to  m . To illustrate an application of our characterization, we provide some examples for which we can answer in polynomial time whether    χ  b   (  G  )    m  . We also generalized the definition of pivoted tree introduced by Irving and Manlove [Robert W. Irving and David F. Manlove. The  b -chromatic number of a graph. Discrete Appl. Math., 91(1-3):127–141, 1999] and show how the existence of our pivots affect the behavior of the  b -chromatic number parameter in  m -tight graphs.	b-coloring;graph coloring	Cláudia Linhares Sales;Leonardo Sampaio	2009	Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.endm.2009.11.035	time complexity;graph power;brooks' theorem;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;fractional coloring;complete coloring;edge coloring;graph coloring;mathematics;windmill graph;wheel graph;list coloring;algorithm	Theory	28.511853497146127	26.6746672904702	22570

Also known as homomorphism functions they allow for the representation of many such invariants, for example, the number of independent sets of a graph or the number nowhere zero k-flows. Contributing to recent developments on the complexity of partition functions [GGJT09, CCL09] we study the complexity of partition functions with complex values. These functions are usually determined by a square matrix A and it was shown in [GGJT09] that for each real-valued symmetric matrix, the corresponding partition function is either polynomial time computable or #P-hard. Extending this result, we give a complete description of the complexity of partition functions definable by Hermitian matrices. These can also be classified into polynomial time computable and #P-hard ones. Although the criterion for polynomial time computability is not describable in a single line, we give a clear account of it in terms of structures associated with Abelian groups. ∗This work was supported in part by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft within the research training group Methods for Discrete Structures (GRK 1408) and by a fellowship within the Postdoc-Programme of the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD). 1 ar X iv :1 00 4. 09 92 v1 [ cs .C C ] 7 A pr 2 01 0	computability;computable function;graph property;independent set (graph theory);p (complexity);partition function (mathematics);polynomial;sharp-p;sharp-p-complete;time complexity	Marc Thurley	2010	CoRR		rank of a partition;hermitian matrix;time complexity;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;independent set;partition refinement;spin glass;graph partition;frequency partition of a graph;mathematics;abelian group;partition function;computational complexity theory;algorithm;symmetric matrix;algebra	Theory	31.99459022432139	31.52663895583712	22718

For the case of known transmit power, we treat the transmit power as a constant and derive a novel non-convex weighted least squares estimator which can be transformed into a second-order cone programming (SOCP) problem for reaching an efficient solution. For the case of unknown transmit power, we treat the transmit power as an additional unknown parameter and propose a hybrid maximum likelihood-SOCP algorithm to alternatively estimate the target node locations and transmit power.

Such a drawing is useful, for example, when the vertices of the graph contain information that we wish displayed on the drawing; it is natural to write this information inside the .rectangle corresponding to the vertex. We call a graph that can be drawn in this fashion a rectangle-visibility graph, or RVG. Our goal is to find classes of graphs that are RVGs. We obtain several results: 1. For 1 $ k $ 4, k-trees are RVGs. 2. Any graph that can be decomposed into two caterpillar forests is an RVG. 3. Any graph whose vertices of degree four or more form a distallce-two independent set is an RVG. 4. Any graph with maximum degree four is an RVG.

Minimum cut problems belong to the class of basic network optimization problems that occur as crucial subproblems in many real-world optimization problems and have a variety of applications in several different areas. We prove that there exist instances of the minimum  s-t -cut problem that cannot be solved by standard single-objective evolutionary algorithms in reasonable time. On the other hand, we develop a bi-criteria approach based on the famous maximum-flow minimum-cut theorem that enables evolutionary algorithms to find an optimum solution in expected polynomial time.	heuristic (computer science);randomized algorithm	Frank Neumann;Joachim Reichel;Martin Skutella	2008		10.1145/1389095.1389250	mathematical optimization;maximum cut;combinatorics;computer science;multi-objective optimization;machine learning;evolutionary algorithm;mathematics;minimum k-cut	AI	24.71697656579927	4.710864188939778	22901

We prove a lemma showing that one can strengthen Mader’s result by replacing the notion of high connectivity by the notion of vertex expansion. Another well known result in graph theory states that for every integer t there is a smallest real c(t), such that every n-vertex graph with c(t)n edges contains a Kt-minor. Fiorini, Joret, Theis and Wood asked if an n-vertex graph G has (c(t) + )n edges then G contains a Kt-minor of order at most C( ) log n. We use our extension of Mader’s theorem to prove that such a graph G must contain a Kt-minor of order at most C( ) log n log log n. Known constructions of graphs with high girth show that this result is tight up to the log log n factor.	girth (graph theory);graph theory;log-space reduction	Asaf Shapira;Benny Sudakov	2015	Combinatorica	10.1007/s00493-015-3013-2	graph power;k-edge-connected graph;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;degree;graph toughness;regular graph;forbidden graph characterization;cycle graph;graph factorization;mathematics;graph minor;complete graph;complement graph;line graph;planar graph	Theory	30.244794581936798	27.8299484342444	22910

In this study, we investigate a number of approaches to confine the target node position to bounded sets for different scenarios. Firstly, if at least one distance estimate error is positive, we derive a simple, but potentially loose upper bound, which is always valid. In addition assuming that the probability density of measurement noise is nonzero for positive values and a sufficiently large number of distance estimates are available, we propose an upper bound, which is valid with high probability. Secondly, if a reasonable lower bound on negative measurement errors is known a priori, we manipulate the distance estimates to obtain a new set with positive measurement errors. In general, we formulate bounds as nonconvex optimization problems. To solve the problems, we employ a relaxation technique and obtain semidefinite programs. We also propose a simple approach to find the bounds in closed forms. Simulation results show reasonable tightness for different bounds in various situations.		Mohammad Reza Gholami;Erik G.

When F is a set of Jordan regions that may only intersect on their boundaries, and such that any point of the plane is contained in at most k regions, it can be proven that χ(F) ≤ 3k/2 + o(k) since the problem is equivalent to cyclic coloring of plane graphs. In this paper, we study the same problem when Jordan regions are replaced by a family F of Jordan curves that do not cross. In other words, any two curves of F are only allowed to “touch” each other. We conjecture that also in this case, χ(F) only depends on the maximum number of curves containing a given point of the plane. To support this conjecture, we prove it when the curves are x-monotone (any vertical line intersect each curve in at most one point), and we give a bound in the general case that also depends on how many times two curves intersect.	color;graph coloring;vertical bar;monotone	Louis Esperet;Daniel Gonçalves;Arnaud Labourel	2009	Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.endm.2009.07.035	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;complete coloring;graph coloring;mathematics;geometry;string graph	Theory	32.60636387133698	23.577018670368183	23450

Given a graph G = (V, E) and a spanning subgraph H of G (the backbone of G), a λ-backbone coloring for G and H is a proper vertex coloring V → {1, 2, . . .} of G in which the colors assigned to adjacent vertices in H differ by at least λ. The algorithmic and combinatorial properties of backbone colorings have been studied for various types of backbones in a number of papers. The main outcome of earlier studies is that the minimum number ` of colors, for which such colorings V → {1, 2, . . . , `} exist, in the worst case is a factor times the chromatic number (for ∗An extended abstract [6] of this paper appeared in the Proceedings of the 33rd Conference on Current Trends in Theory and Practice of Computer Science (SOFSEM 2007). 144 H.

We show here that for split graphs and matching or star backbones, ` is at most a small additive constant (depending on λ) higher than the chromatic number. Our proofs combine algorithmic and combinatorial arguments. We also indicate other graph classes for which our results imply better upper bounds on ` than the previously known bounds.	algorithm;best, worst and average case;color;computer science;file spanning;graph coloring;internet backbone;matching (graph theory);neighbourhood (graph theory);star height;utility functions on indivisible goods	Hajo Broersma;Bert Marchal;Daniël Paulusma;A.

This paper describes four approximation algorithms for unconstrained versions of problems defined by touring an ordered set of polygons. It contributes to an approximate and partial answer to the previously open problem “What is the complexity of the touringpolygons problem for pairwise disjoint, simple and not necessarily convex polygons?” by providing κ(ε)O(n) approximation algorithms for solving this problem, either for given start and end points p and q, or with allowing to have those variable, where n is the total number of vertices of the given k simple and pairwise disjoint polygons; κ(ε) defines the numerical accuracy in dependency of a selected ε > 0. 1 TPP Introduction and Review The touring polygon problem (TPP), as defined in the abstract of this paper, does have various applications such as for parts cutting in the industry (e.g., moving the head of a cutting robot to subsequent start positions of planar shapes) or for route planning in general when the task consists in visiting selected polygonal regions. The TPP already has a history of publications addressing this subject; see, for example, [1, 2, 7, 11, 15]. 1.1 Variants of the Touring Polygon Problem We recall some notations from [2]; this paper introduced the TPP. Let π be a plane. Consider simple, pairwise disjoint polygons Pi ⊂ π, where i = 1, 2, . . . , k, and two points p, q ∈ π \ ⋃k i=1 Pi. Note that a simple polygon P is a planar region whose frontier ∂P is normally represented by a polygonal path (i.e., a sequence of line segments whose endpoints define the vertices of P ). ∗College of Computer Science and Technology, Huaqiao University, Xiamen, Fujian, China, {panpanty, li.fajie}@yahoo.com †Computer Science Department, The University of Auckland, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1142, New Zealand, r.klette@auckland.ac.nz Let ρ(p, p1, p2, , . . . , pk, q) be a polygonal path in π that starts at p0 = p, is then incident with points pi in the given order, and ends at pk+1 = q, with pi ∈ π, for i = 1, 2, . . . , k. We denote such a path briefly by ρ(p, q) if this does not cause any confusion (i.e., if intermediate points pi are known by context or not important to be listed). A path ρ(p, q) visits a polygon R at point r ∈ R if the path intersects R, and r is the first (i.e., along the path) point in R on this path. Obviously, r ∈ ∂R. The (unconstrained) fixed TPP is defined as follows: Find a shortest path ρ(p, p1, p2, , . . . , pk, q) such that it visits each of the polygons Pi in the given order at point pi, for i = 1, 2, . . . , k. The path may be further constrained by some predefined properties, and we discuss examples below. – In case that start and end points of the path are not given then the problem becomes the (unconstrained) floating TPP : Let P0 = Pk. Find a cyclic shortest path ρ(p0, p1, p2, , . . . , pk−1, pk), with p0 = pk, such that it visits each of the polygons Pi in the given order at point pi, for i = 0, 1, 2, . . . , k. Obviously, in this case it does not matter at which polygon to start, and we could reorder the polygons modulo k. We just mention an example of further constraints (without discussing it further in this paper). Let F ⊂ π be a simple, not necessarily convex polygon which contains the union of some polygons, all given in the plane π. Then F is called a fence with respect to those polygons. In our case, we have polygons P1, . . . , Pk. Let Fi ⊂ π be a fence for polygons Pi and Pi+1, for i = 0, 1, 2, . . . , k, with degenerated polygons P0 = {p = p0} and Pk+1 = {q = pk+1}. An example of a constrained fixed TPP is defined as follows: Find a shortest path ρ(p, p1, p2, , . . . , pk, q) such that it visits each of the polygons Pi in the given order at point pi, for i = 1, 2, . . . , k, also satisfying that Fi contains the subpath from pi to pi+1, for i = 0, 1, 2, . . . , k. 22 Canadian Conference on Computational Geometry, 2010 The subpath from pi to pi+1, for i = 0, 1, 2, . . . , k, needs to be a shortest path within a given polygon Fi. A shortest path, connecting two given points within a simple polygon, and fully contained in this polygon, can be constructed in time linear in the number of vertices of this polygon [14]. 1.2 Variants of the Parts Cutting Problem In a variety of industries, such as clothing, window manufacturing, or metal sheet processing, it is necessary to cut a set of parts (modeled by polygons) from large sheets of paper, cloth, glass, metal, and so forth. Motivated by such applications, [7] introduced the following three models of cutting scenarios: • Continuous cutting. The path of the cutting tool visits each object (i.e., polygon) to be cut just once. The tool can engage the object at any point on its frontier, but must cut the entire object before it travels to the next object. Accordingly, the same frontier point must be used for entry and departure from the object. • Endpoint cutting. The tool can enter and exit the object only at some predefined frontier points; however, it may cut the object in sections (i.e., it may visit an object repeatedly). • Intermittent cutting. This is the most general version of the problem in which the object can be cut in sections and there is no restriction on the frontier points that can be used for entry or exit. [7] focused on solving the continuous cutting problem where each object is a polygon, also called the platecutting traveling salesman problem (P-TSP). The PTSP is a generalization of the well-known traveling salesman problem (TSP) [10]. The P-TSP is more general than the generalized TSP (GTSP) as discussed in [9, 15]. If each polygon degenerates into a single vertex then the P-TSP becomes the TSP which is known to be NP-hard [3]. It follows that the P-TSP is NP-hard as well. The ordered P-TSP is a simplified TSP by providing a predefined order of visits; see Fig. 1. The polygons may still be nonconvex as well. [7] solved the ordered P-TSP by a heuristic approach based on a Lagrange relaxation method as discussed in [4, 5], without providing a time complexity analysis for this proposed approach. As a follow-up of this work, [1] proved that a further simplified ordered P-TSP, where polygons are all assumed to be convex (see Figure 2), is solvable in polynomial time. If, additionally, the start point is also given (see Figure 3), then the authors of [2] claim that they can solve this fixed problem in time O(kn log(n/k)), where n is the total number of vertices of polygons Figure 1: The ordered P-TSP in [7]. Not necessarily convex polygons are assumed to be given in a particular order. The cutting tool may travel across the given polygons. Figure 2: The ordered P-TSP in [1], also assuming that all polygons are convex. Figure 3: The P-TSP as considered in [2], now also with a given start point s. Pi ⊂ π, for i = 1, 2, . . . , k. Obviously, this fixed ordered P-TSP coincides with the fixed TPP as defined earlier; in this paper we prefer to use the naming based on touring polygons rather than on a traveling salesman. CCCG 2010, Winnipeg MB, August 9–11, 2010 2 Contributions of this Paper According to [2], “one of the most intriguing open problems” identified by their results “is to determine the complexity of the fixed TPP for pairwise disjoint nonconvex simple polygons”. In this paper, we focus on the unconstrained fixed TPP (i.e., given start and end point of the path) and floating TPP (i.e., no given start or end point) under the condition that the convex hulls of the input polygons Pi are pairwise disjoint, but the polygons Pi itself may be nonconvex. Algorithm 2 in Section 3 partially answers the stated open problem for the fixed TPP by providing an approximation algorithm running in time κ(ε) · O(n), where n is the total number of vertices of all polygons. The solution technique proposed in [2] can only handle the fixed TPP, the fixed safari problem, and the fixed watchman route problem, all for convex polygons only. Our solution technique is suitable for solving both the fixed and the floating TPP with the same time complexity, also allowing nonconvex polygons Pi with pairwise disjoint convex hulls. (Our method might also be useful for solving the floating watchman route, the floating safari problem, and the floating zookeeper problem; but this is not a subject in this paper.) Regarding approximation (or approximate) algorithms, we refer to the following definition as given, for example, in [6]: An algorithm is an δ-approximation algorithm for a minimization problem P iff, for each input instance I of P , the algorithm delivers a solution that is at most δ times the optimum solution. Our approximate algorithms are based on the idea of a rubberband algorithm (RBA); for example, see [11], for variants of RBAs. Basically, such an algorithm starts with an initial path through the provided sequence of step sets (here: polygons Pi), and runs then in iterations through those (possibly “adjusted”) sequence again while reducing (compared to the previous run) the length of the current path in each run. The important issue is to guarantee that the resulting Cauchy sequence of lengths is actually converging to the minimum length (i.e., the global minimum). Let ESP denote the class of any Euclidean shortest path problem. An Euclidean path is a δ-approximation (Euclidean) path for an ESP problem iff its length is at most δ times the optimum solution. We will also refer to a convex hull algorithm (see, e.g., [13] or Figure 13.7, [8]), which reads an ordered sequence of vertices of a planar simple polygonal curve ρ and outputs an ordered sequence of vertices of the convex hull of ρ; its running time is O(|V (ρ)|).

When a MIMO radar transmits orthogonal waveforms, the reflected signals from scatterers are linearly independent of each other. Therefore, adaptive receive filters, such as Capon and amplitude and phase estimation (APES) filters, can be directly employed in MIMO radar applications. High levels of noise and strong clutter, however, significantly worsen detection performance of the data-dependent beamformers due to a shortage of snapshots. The iterative adaptive approach (IAA), a nonparametric and user parameter-free weighted least-squares algorithm, was recently shown to offer improved resolution and interference rejection performance in several passive and active sensing applications. In this paper, we show how IAA can be extended to MIMO radar imaging, in both the negligible and nonnegligible intrapulse Doppler cases, and we also establish some theoretical convergence properties of IAA. In addition, we propose a regularized IAA algorithm, referred to as IAA-R, which can perform better than IAA by accounting for unrepresented additive noise terms in the signal model. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the superior performance of MIMO radar over single-input multiple-output (SIMO) radar, and further highlight the improved performance achieved with the proposed IAA-R method for target imaging.	additive white gaussian noise;clutter;data dependency;interference (communication);iterative method;least squares;mimo;phased array;quantum phase estimation algorithm;radar;rejection sampling;utility functions on indivisible goods;waveform	William Roberts;Petre Stoica;Jian Li;Tarik Yardibi;Firooz Sadjadi	2010	IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing	10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2038964	phased array;telecommunications;space-time adaptive processing;computer science;signal processing;control theory;mathematics	Metrics	51.33929923906568	8.323808093786596	23614

In this situation our concern is whether the non FSMX tree model is an exponential family or not. This paper's contribution is to show that the non FSMX tree model is not an exponential family.

86f4ed733e34d8ef3c17857da21785604bd45ff7	entropic phase maps in discrete quantum gravity		Path summation offers a flexible general approach to quantum theory, including quantum gravity. In the latter setting, summation is performed over a space of evolutionary pathways in a history configuration space. Discrete causal histories called acyclic directed sets offer certain advantages over similar models appearing in the literature, such as causal sets. Path summation defined in terms of these histories enables derivation of discrete Schrödinger-type equations describing quantum spacetime dynamics for any suitable choice of algebraic quantities associated with each evolutionary pathway. These quantities, called phases, collectively define a phase map from the space of evolutionary pathways to a target object, such as the unit circle S1 ⊂ C, or an analogue such as S3 or S7. This paper explores the problem of identifying suitable phase maps for discrete quantum gravity, focusing on a class of S1-valued maps defined in terms of “structural increments” of histories, called terminal states. Invariants such as state automorphism groups determine multiplicities of states, and induce families of natural entropy functions. A phase map defined in terms of such a function is called an entropic phase map. The associated dynamical law may be viewed as an abstract combination of Schrödinger’s equation and the second law of thermodynamics.	approximation algorithm;causal filter;causality;compiler;computation;concatenation;context-sensitive grammar;directed acyclic graph;directed graph;encode;entropy (information theory);first-order predicate;gene regulatory network;graph automorphism;graph theory;ibm 1401 symbolic programming system;interference (communication);level of detail;map;maximal set;numerical analysis;numerical relativity;organizing (structure);principle of least action;quantum mechanics;random graph;randomness;rendering (computer graphics);schrödinger;spaces;state space;stationary process;turing completeness;utility functions on indivisible goods;vertex-transitive graph	Benjamin F.

In this paper we present an alternative proof, which we believe is conceptually more transparent and easier to understand. For this purpose, we introduce a tool called the 2-link visibility diagram that represents 2-link visibility, which has other applications.	diagram;java;suicidegirls;turing completeness	Tsunehiko Kameda;Ichiro Suzuki;Masafumi Yamashita	2016	Theor.

In particular, we consider the graph classes of proper intersection graphs of axis-parallel rectangles, proper interval graphs, and unit disk graphs. All the above mentioned graph classes belong to a more general graph class of (k + 1)clawfree graphs (respectively, for k = 4, 2, 5). We prove that sum coloring is NP-hard for penny graphs and unit square graphs which implies NP-hardness for unit disk graphs and proper intersection graphs of axis-parallel rectangles. We show a 2-approximation algorithm for unit square graphs, with the assumption that the geometric representation of the graph is given. For sum multi-coloring, we confirm that the greedy first-fit coloring, after ordering vertices by their demands, achieves a k-approximation for the preemptive version of sum multi-coloring on (k + 1)-clawfree graphs. Finally, we study priority algorithms as a model for greedy algorithms for the sum coloring and sum multi-coloring problems. We show various inapproximation results under several natural input representations.	apache axis;approximation algorithm;graph coloring;greedy algorithm;np-hardness;optic axis of a crystal;planar graph;unit disk graph	Allan Borodin;Ioana Ivan;Yuli Ye;Bryce Zimny	2012	Theor.

In this paper, we propose two heuristics for exact NMF, one inspired from simulated annealing and the other from the greedy randomized adaptive search procedure. We show that these two heuristics are able to compute exact nonnegative factorizations for several classes of nonnegative matrices (namely, linear Euclidean distance matrices, slack matrices, unique-disjointness matrices, and randomly generated matrices) and as such demonstrate their superiority over standard multi-start strategies. We also consider a hybridization between these two heuristics that allows us to combine the advantages of both methods. Finally, we discuss the use of these heuristics to gain insight on the behavior of the nonnegative rank, i.e., the minimum factorization rank such that an exact NMF exists. In particular, we disprove a conjecture on the nonnegative rank of a Kronecker product, propose a new upper bound on the extension complexity of generic n-gons and conjecture the exact value of (i) the extension complexity of regular n-gons and (ii) the nonnegative rank of a submatrix of the slack matrix of the correlation polytope.	approximation algorithm;computation;computer simulation;document classification;euclidean distance;greedy algorithm;greedy randomized adaptive search procedure;heuristic (computer science);local search (optimization);machine epsilon;maxima and minima;non-negative matrix factorization;numerical analysis;procedural generation;randomized algorithm;rounding;simulated annealing;slack variable;surround sound;the matrix;time complexity	Arnaud Vandaele;Nicolas Gillis;François Glineur;Daniel Tuyttens	2016	J.

Using regular logic, many properties of relations over sets lift to these models, including the correspondence between Frobenius structures and internal groupoids. Over compact Hausdorff spaces, this lifting gives continuous symmetric encryption. Over a regular Mal’cev category, this correspondence gives a characterization of categories of completely positive maps, enabling the formulation of quantum features. These models are closer to Hilbert spaces than relations over sets in several respects: Heisenberg uncertainty, impossibility of broadcasting, and behavedness of rank one morphisms.	encryption;hausdorff dimension;hilbert space;lambda lifting;map;q public license;quantum mechanics;quantum superposition;rel;symmetric-key algorithm	Chris Heunen;Sean Tull	2015	CoRR	10.4204/EPTCS.195.18	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;higher-dimensional algebra;topology;mathematics;regular category;algebra	Theory	42.51185369723828	30.212386322483358	23979

Vempala and Xiao (2011) proposed a local search algorithm, and showed that it was able to estimateE accurately with polynomial time and sample complexity, if the dimension ofE is treated as a constant and with the assumption that all one-dimensional marginals of the non-Gaussian distribution overE have non-Gaussian moments. In this paper, we propose a simple spectral algorithm called REWEIGHTED PCA, and prove that it possesses the same guarantee. The principle that underlies this approach is a new characterization of multivariate Gaussian distributions.	data point;local search (optimization);maximal set;p (complexity);polynomial;sample complexity;search algorithm;spectral method;time complexity	Yan Shuo Tan;Roman Vershynin	2018			mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;machine learning;mathematics;statistics	Vision	39.10984322778875	12.931241201110362	24020

In this paper, a general technique is presented for adding a range restriction to such a problem. The technique is applied to the problem of querying a set of colored points (resp. fat triangles) with a fat triangle (resp. point). For both problems, a data structure is obtained having size O(n 1+ ) and query time O((logn) 2 + C). Here, C denotes the number of colors reported by the query, and is an arbitrarily small positive constant.	color;data structure	Prosenjit Gupta;Ravi Janardan;Michiel H. M. Smid	1997	Inf. Process.

50cf5a236b66e3032efea2682b4383ee3081f9be	two algorithms for three dimensional orthogonal graph drawing	p 600 700 orthogonal;graph drawing;three dimensional;g 210 bends;p 060 3d	We use basic results from graph theory to design two algorithms for constructing 3-dimensional, intersection-free orthogonal grid drawings of n vertex graphs of maximum degree 6. Our first algorithm gives drawings bounded by an O(x/~ ) • O(x/~ • O(v~ ) box; each edge route contains at most 7 bends. The best previous result generated edge routes containing up to 16 bends per route. Our second algorithm gives drawings having at most 3 bends per edge route. The drawings he in an O(n) • O(n) x O(n) bounding box. Together, the two algorithms initiate the study of bend/bounding box trade-off issues for 3-dimensional grid drawings. 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n The 3-dimensional orthogonal grid consists of grid points whose coordinates are all integers, together with the axis-parallel grid lines determined by these points. A 3-dimensional orthogonal grid drawing of a graph G places the vertices of G at grid points and routes the edges of G along sequences of contiguous segments contained in the grid lines. Edge routes are allowed to contain bends but are not allowed to cross or to overlap, i.e., no internal point, not necessarily a grid point, of one edge route may lie in any other edge route. Throughout this paper, grid refers to the 3-dimensional orthogonal grid, and grid drawing refers to the type of 3-dimensional orthogonal grid drawing just described. Note that because each grid point lies at the intersection of three grid lines, any graph that admits a grid drawing necessarily has maximum vertex degree at most 6. Figure 1 shows a grid drawing of a graph. This particular drawing lies in a 2 x 3 x 2 hounding box. The edge route joining the two extremal vertices in the Z-direction lies along the top, back and bottom faces of the box and contains 2 bends. The edge route joining the two extremal vertices in the X-direction also contains 2 bends, but passes through the interior of the box. While the graph drawing literature has extensively investigated 2-dimensional grid drawings of graphs (see [7]), 3-dimensional grid drawing has been little studied. Our research is motivated in part by recent interest in exploring the utility of 3-dimensional drawings of graphs for visualization purposes.

A performance limit obtained for any distributed parameter estimator with a known prior is adopted as a guidance for quantizer design. Aided by the performance limit, the optimal quantizer and a set of noisy observation models that achieve the performance limit are derived. Further, when the performance limit may not be achievable for some applications, we develop a near-optimal estimator which consists of a dithered noise and a single threshold quantizer. In the scenario where the parameter is Gaussian and signal-to-noise ratio is greater than -1.138 dB, we show that one can construct such an estimator that achieves approximately 99.65% of the performance limit.	bayesian network;dither;estimation theory;quantization (signal processing);sensor;signal-to-noise ratio	Xia Li;Jun Quo;Uri Rogers;Hao Chen	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2016.7472370	mathematical optimization;cramér–rao bound;quantization;pattern recognition;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	47.96653257490014	6.730452841098692	24167

(A graph is planar if it can be drawn in the plane (or the sphere) without crossings. 12 For definitions of other related graph classes, see the entry on Bidimensionality (2004; Demaine, 13 Fomin, Hajiaghayi, Thilikos).) For example, a maximum independent set asks to find a maximum 14 subset of vertices in a graph that induce no edges. This problem is inapproximable in general 15 graphs within a factor of n for any u003e 0 unless NPDZPP (and inapproximable within n 16 unless PDNP), while for planar graphs, there is a 4-approximation (or simple 5-approximation) by 17 taking the largest color class in a vertex 4-coloring (or 5-coloring). Another is minimum dominating 18 set, where the goal is to find a minimum subset of vertices such that every vertex is either in or 19 adjacent to the subset. This problem is inapproximable in general graphs within log n for some 20 u003e 0 unless PDNP, but as we will see, for planar graphs, the problem admits a polynomial-time 21 approximation scheme (PTAS): a collection of .1C /-approximation algorithms for all u003e 0. 22	approximation;graph theory;planar graph	Mohammad Taghi Hajiaghayi;Erik D.

By allowing uncertainty several geometric notions such as parallelism and concurrency become inconsistent with Euclidean geometry. In previous work we explained how consistency can be partially restored by graph-theoretical grouping algorithms. In this paper we study inconsistencies at a higher-level, e.g., the violation of Desargues's Theorem or Pappus's Theorem. We provide a simple algorithm that completely restores Euclidean consistency. Although the algorithm may not give optimal results with respect to grouping, it shows a way to develop more sophisticated algorithms to obtain global consistency in uncertain geometry.

In this paper, we introduce the notions of states, state-morphisms, state operators and state-morphism operators to quasi-pMV algebras. First, we present the related properties of states on quasi-pMV algebras and show that states and Bosbach states coincide on any quasi-pMV algebra. And then we investigate the relationship between state-morphisms and the normal and maximal ideals of quasi-pMV algebras. We prove state-morphisms and extremal states are equivalent. The existence of states on quasi-pMV algebras is also discussed. Finally, state operators and state-morphism operators are introduced to quasi-pMV algebras, and the corresponding structures are called state quasi-pMV algebras and state-morphism quasi-pMV algebras, respectively. We investigate the related properties of ideals under state operators and state-morphism operators. Meanwhile, we show that there is a bijective correspondence between normal (sigma )-ideals and ideal congruences on state quasi-pMV algebras.		Wenjuan Chen;Wieslaw A.

213ae33e359f0fa5f5dc9542fd0a165e87b8df92	a universal slope set for 1-bend planar drawings		We describe a set of ∆−1 slopes that are universal for 1-bend planar drawings of planar graphs of maximum degree ∆ ≥ 4; this establishes a new upper bound of ∆− 1 on the 1-bend planar slope number. By universal we mean that every planar graph of degree ∆ has a planar drawing with at most one bend per edge and such that the slopes of the segments forming the edges belong to the given set of slopes. This improves over previous results in two ways: Firstly, the best previously known upper bound for the 1-bend planar slope number was 3 2 (∆− 1) (the known lower bound being 4 (∆ − 1)); secondly, all the known algorithms to construct 1-bend planar drawings with O(∆) slopes use a different set of slopes for each graph and can have bad angular resolution, while our algorithm uses a universal set of slopes, which also guarantees that the minimum angle between any two edges incident to a vertex is π (∆−1) . 1998 ACM Subject Classification G.2.1 Combinatorics, G.2.2 Graph Theory	algorithm;angularjs;bend minimization;graph theory;planar graph;slope number;upward planar drawing	Patrizio Angelini;Michael A.

That is we show that if there is no alternating cycle in an edge-coloured graph, G, then it contains a vertex z, such that there is no connected component of G ? z, which is joined to z with edges of diierent colors. Our extension implies a polynomial algorithm, for deciding if an edge-coloured graph contains an alternating cycle (see also 1]).	algorithm;color;connected component (graph theory);dave grossman (game developer);polynomial	Anders Yeo	1997	J.

We consider rank-one binary matrix approximations that identify the dominant patterns of the data, while preserving its discrete property. A best approximation on such data has a minimum set of inconsistent entries, i.e., mismatches between the given binary data and the approximate matrix. Due to the hardness of the problem, previous accounts of such problems employ heuristics and the resulting approximation may be far away from the optimal one. In this paper, we show that the rank-one binary matrix approximation can be reformulated as a 0-1 integer linear program (ILP). However, the ILP formulation is computationally expensive even for small-size matrices. We propose a linear program (LP) relaxation, which is shown to achieve a guaranteed approximation error bound. We further extend the proposed formulations using the regularization technique, which is commonly employed to address overfitting. The LP formulation is restricted to medium-size matrices, due to the large number of variables involved for large matrices. Interestingly, we show that the proposed approximate formulation can be transformed into an instance of the minimum s-t cut problem, which can be solved efficiently by finding maximum flows. Our empirical study shows the efficiency of the proposed algorithm based on the maximum flow. Results also confirm the established theoretical bounds.	analysis of algorithms;approximation algorithm;approximation error;binary data;chroma subsampling;cluster analysis;cut (graph theory);data compression;heuristic (computer science);linear programming relaxation;matrix regularization;maximum flow problem;overfitting;singular value decomposition	Bao-Hong Shen;Shuiwang Ji;Jieping Ye	2009		10.1145/1557019.1557103	maximum flow problem;regularization;mathematical optimization;approximation error;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;minimum cut;computer science;linear programming;linear programming relaxation;mathematics;matrix decomposition;empirical research;integer matrix;statistics	ML	35.08140618289874	10.097209175505746	24912

5728e58b52abef9c36eb3622dc0dbc6d32f077db	symmetric and asymmetric $k$-center clustering under stability		The k-center problem is a canonical and long-studied facility location and clustering problem with many applications in both its symmetric and asymmetric forms. Both versions of the problem have tight approximation factors on worst case instances: a 2-approximation for symmetric k-center and a log∗(k)approximation for the asymmetric version. Therefore to improve on these ratios, one must go beyond the worst case. In this work, we take this approach and provide strong positive results both for the asymmetric and symmetric k-center problems under two very natural input stability (promise) conditions. We consider both the α-perturbation resilience notion of Bilu and Linial [11], which states that the optimal solution does not change under any α-factor perturbation to the input distances, and the (α, )approximation stability notion of Balcan et al. [6], which states that any α-approximation to the cost of the optimal solution should be -close in the solution space (i.e., the partitioning) to the optimal solution. We show that by merely assuming 3-perturbation resilience or (2, 0)-approximation stability, the exact solution for the asymmetric k-center problem can be found in polynomial time. To our knowledge, this is the first problem that is hard to approximate to any constant factor in the worst case, yet can be optimally solved in polynomial time under perturbation resilience for a constant value of α. In the case of 2approximation stability, we prove our result is tight by showing k-center under (2 − )-approximation stability is hard unless NP = RP . For the case of symmetric k-center, we give an efficient algorithm to cluster 2-perturbation resilient instances. Our results illustrate a surprising relation between symmetric and asymmetric k-center instances under these stability conditions. Unlike approximation ratio, for which symmetric k-center is easily solved to a factor of 2 but asymmetric k-center cannot be approximated to any constant factor, both symmetric and asymmetric k-center can be solved optimally under resilience to small constant-factor perturbations. ∗Authors’ addresses: {ninamf,nhaghtal,crwhite}@cs.cmu.edu. ar X iv :1 50 5. 03 92 4v 1 [ cs .D S] 1 4 M ay 2 01 5	approximation algorithm;best, worst and average case;cluster analysis;cyber resilience;facility location problem;feasible region;metric k-center;np (complexity);perturbation theory;polynomial;rp (complexity);time complexity	Maria-Florina Balcan;Nika Haghtalab;Colin White	2015	CoRR		time complexity;mathematics;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;exact solutions in general relativity;mathematical optimization;facility location problem;cluster analysis;perturbation (astronomy)	Theory	24.9712629142424	18.627653233857853	24992

We present an approach based on an intermediate topological level with dynamic space ordering (dso) heuristics. Our software ARCHiPLAN proceeds through a number of steps. First, all the topologically different solutions, without presuming any precise dimension, are enumerated. Next, we may evolve in this topological solution space, and than refine some of them to form consistent geometrical solutions. For each topological solution chosen, the optimising geometrical solution is determined from a cost, useful surface or wall length. By using dynamic space ordering heuristics in the topological level the enumeration time has been reduced.	algorithm;computation;constraint programming;eisenstein's criterion;feasible region;heuristic (computer science);interactivity;langrisser schwarz;loss function;optimization problem	Benachir Medjdoub;Bernard Yannou	2001	AI in Engineering	10.1016/S0954-1810(00)00027-3	t1 space;mathematical optimization;topological vector space;function space;loop space;heuristics;simply connected space;topological quantum number;topological space;trivial topology;locally finite collection;topological sorting;zero-dimensional space;finite topological space	AI	28.629006326072652	10.7931705629246	25016

Some of the cells are colored gray, and two gray cells are considered connected if they are adjacent vertically or horizontally. A set of connected gray cells is called a gray area. Some of the gray areas are labeled by numbers, and some of the non-gray cells contain circles with numbers. The object of the puzzle is to draw arrows, vertically or horizontally, from all circles to gray areas so that (i) the arrows do not bend, and do not cross other circles or lines of other arrows, (ii) the number in a gray area is equal to the total of the numbers of the circles which enter the gray area, and (iii) gray areas with no numbers may have any sum total, but at least one circle must enter each gray area. It is shown that deciding whether a Yosenabe puzzle has a solution is NP-complete.

We extend this theory to general cellular automata using topological methods. The starting point is the observation that the rescaled space-time diagrams, intersected with an appropriately chosen compact set, form sequences in a compact, metric space. They necessarily possess converging subsequences. In the present paper we define graphical limit sets as the collection of the accumulation points. The main result is that for a large class of cellular automata the graphical limit set defined in this way carries a group structure, which is either the trivial group consisting of one element only, or is homeomorphic to S 1 . The well known self-similar, graphical limit sets are representatives of the second class.	automata theory;cellular automaton	Johannes Müller;Hengrui Jiang	2015	Theor. Comput.

It is shown that with every basic uniform neighbourhood structure on an inhabited set there is associated a natural set–set apartness relation. A large class of uniform neighbourhood spaces is produced by a construction that classically gives the unique totally bounded uniform structure inducing the given apartness on a symmetric T 1  apartness space with the Efremovic property. Thus although, constructively, it remains unknown (and very unlikely) that such an apartness is generally induced by a uniform structure, it closely corresponds with a uniform neighbourhood structure. Uniform neighbourhood structures also provide a setting for notions of total boundedness and continuity akin to those in uniform spaces.		Douglas S. Bridges	2016	Ann. Pure Appl.

We consider a simple combinatorial lower bound for the problem from which we propose a decomposition approach to break down the problem into several smaller subproblems that are more tractable computationally and then recombine the obtained solutions to generate a solution to the original larger problem. We also propose effective constructive heuristics to the problem which take into consideration the problem structure in order to obtain good feasible solutions. Computational results show that our decomposition approach is very fast and can drastically reduce the size of the subproblems that have to be solved, allowing a branch-and-cut algorithm to perform much better than when used over the full original problem. The results also show that the proposed constructive heuristics are very rapid and generate very good quality solutions, outperforming other heuristics available in the literature in several situations.	algorithm;branch and cut;cobham's thesis;computation;file spanning;heuristic (computer science);hyper-heuristic;spanning tree;vertex (geometry)	Rafael A.

It starts by developing information flow models for continuous-time, discrete-state filtering problems, identifying rates of information supply and dissipation. Time reversal yields a dual filtering problem in which these flows are interchanged. The dual problem comprises a diffusion signal with nonlinear dynamics, and observations of the point process variety, but yields a finite-dimensional nonlinear filter. The paper goes on to define an entropic time derivative for a general class of Markov processes and relates the entropic derivatives of the signal and filter to the rates of information supply and dissipation. This leads to the definition of a rate of interactive entropy production, which measures the time asymmetry of the interaction between the signal and filter. This asymmetry is of the same nature as that occurring in the theory of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics based on stochastic dynamics. In this context, the interaction between the signal and filter is nondissipative-a property intimately connected with the existence of a dual problem.		Nigel J. Newton	2007	SIAM J.

We propose an invariants-based method for dealing with this problem. An invariant QT of a tree T under a k-state Markov model, where a generalized time parameter is identified with the E edges of T, allows us to recognize whether data on N observed species can be associated with the N terminal vertices of T in the sense of having been generated on T rather than on any other tree with N terminals. The form of the generalized time parameter is a positive determinant matrix in some semigroup S of stochastic matrices. The invariance is with respect to the choice of the set of E matrices in S, one associated with each of the E edges of T. We apply a general """"empirical"""" method of finding invariants of a parametrized functional form. It involves calculating the probability f of all KN data possibilities for each of m sets of E matrices in S to associate with the edges of T, then solving for the parameters using the m equations of form Q(f) = 0. We discuss the problems of finding asymmetric models satisfying the property of semigroup closure, of finding asymmetric models that admit invariants at all, and of the computational complexity of the method. We propose a class of semigroups Sc containing matrices of form [formula: see text] to account for A+T versus G+C asymmetries in DNA base composition. Quadratic invariants are obtained for rooted trees with three and with four terminals. In the latter case the smallest set of algebraically independent invariants is sought. These invariants are applied to data pertaining the fungal evolution and to the origin of mitochondria as bacterial endosymbionts."""	algebraic independence;base composition;base excess:scnc:pt:blda:qn:calculated;beneath a steel sky;closure;computational complexity theory;higher-order function;inference;invariant (computer science);large;linear algebra;markov chain;markov model;nucleotides;phylogenetics;polynomial;population parameter;requirement;stainless steel;stochastic matrix;trees (plant)	Vincent Ferretti;B.

To guarantee the optimality of the Kalman filter, the noise covariances need to be exactly known. However, this is not necessarily true in many practical applications. Usually, they are either completely unknown or at most partially known. In this technical note, we study performance of the Kalman filter with mismatched process and measurement noise covariances. For this purpose, three mean squared errors (MSEs) are used, namely the ideal MSE (IMSE), the filter calculated MSE (FMSE), and the true MSE (TMSE). The main contribution of this work is that the relationships between the three MSEs are disclosed from two points of views. The first view is about their ordering and the second view is about the relative closeness from the FMSE and TMSE to the IMSE. Using the first view, it is found that for the case with positive (definite) deviation from the truth, the FMSE is the worst and the IMSE is the best. And for the case with negative (definite) deviation, the TMSE is the worst and the best is the FMSE. Using the second view, it is found that the TMSE is relatively closer to the IMSE than the FMSE if the deviation is larger than certain threshold, and the TMSE will be farther away otherwise.

7cf20f748545dc0668018620625e2086d7cdcb29	labeling of benzenoid systems which reflects the vertex-distance relations		It is shown that the vertices of benzenoid systems admit a labeling which reflects their distance relations. To every vertex of a molecular graph of a benzenoid hydrocarbon a sequence of zeros and ones (a binary number) can be associated, such that the number of positions in which these sequences differ is equal to the graph-theoretic vertex distance. It is shown by an example that such labelings can be used not only for nomenclature purposes but also for fast evaluation of molecular parameters based on the graph distance.	binary number;graph theory;molecular graph	Sandi Klavzar;Ivan Gutman;Bojan Mohar	1995	Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Sciences	10.1021/ci00025a030	combinatorics;molecular graph;distance;vertex (geometry);vertex distance;binary number;mathematics	Theory	32.51676223536771	30.66993108104842	25433

In other words S is dominating if the sets S ∩N [u] where u ∈ V (G) and N [u] denotes the closed neighbourhood of u in G, are all nonempty. A set S ⊆ V (G) is called a locating code in G, if the sets S ∩ N [u] where u ∈ V (G) \ S are all nonempty and distinct. A set S ⊆ V (G) is called an identifying code in G, if the sets S ∩ N [u] where u ∈ V (G) are all nonempty and distinct. We study locating and identifying codes in the circulant networks Cn(1, 3). For an integer n > 7, the graph Cn(1, 3) has vertex set Zn and edges xy where x, y ∈ Zn and |x − y| ∈ {1, 3}. We prove that a smallest locating code in Cn(1, 3) has size dn/3e + c, where c ∈ {0, 1}, and a smallest identifying code in Cn(1, 3) has size d4n/11e+ c′, where c′ ∈ {0, 1}.	apollonian network;circulant matrix;code;dominating set;semantic network;vertex (graph theory)	Mohammad Ghebleh;Ludovít Niepel	2013	Discrete Applied Mathematics	10.1016/j.dam.2013.03.008	arithmetic;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics	Theory	30.24982628449704	31.615462984318633	25439

e7b90f154c3fb1822f69af194c2569f9990a7dd2	on doubly universal functions		Let $(\lambda\_n)$ be a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers. Inspired by the notions of topological multiple recurrence and disjointness in dynamical systems, Costakis and Tsirivas have recently established that there exist power series $\sum\_{k\geq 0}a\_kz^k$ with radius of convergence 1 such that the pairs of partial sums $\{(\sum\_{k=0}^na\_kz^k,\sum\_{k=0}^{\lambda\_n}a\_kz^k): n=1,2,\dots\}$ approximate all pairs of polynomials uniformly on compact subsets $K\subset\{z\in\mathbb{C} :| z|\textgreater{}1\},$ with connected complement, if and only if $\limsup\_{n}\frac{\lambda\_n}{n}=+\infty.$ In the present paper, we give a new proof of this statement avoiding the use of advanced tools of potential theory. It allows to obtain the algebraic genericity of the set of such power series and to study the case of doubly universal infinitely differentiable functions. Further we show that the Ces\`aro means of partial sums of power series with radius of convergence 1 cannot be frequently universal.

Let Λn denote the subset of all binary matrices (matrices of zeroes and ones) in ∆n. If G is a bipartite multigraph let B(G) denote the usual ‘biadjacency’ matrix of G. That is, B(G) is the matrix with rows and columns respectively corresponding to the vertices in the two parts of G, and with each entry recording how many edges there are between the vertices corresponding to the row and column in which the entry lies. If G is a k-regular bipartite multigraph on 2n vertices then B(G)∈∆n. Moreover, B(G) ∈ Λn iff G is simple. Schrijver [5] has studied the minimum permanent in ∆n. Our purpose in this note is to use his results to deduce information about the minimum permanent in Λn. As an aside, it has been conjectured by Minc (Conjecture 24 in [4]) that the minimum permanents in Λn and ∆ k n coincide. Our results will be consistent with that conjecture, but do not seem to represent progress towards its resolution.	addendum;adjacency matrix;alexander schrijver;column (database);minc;multigraph;resolution (logic);the matrix;vertex (geometry)	Ian M.

Shape distortion is evaluated using Airy's criterion and compared to analogous projection onto a planar surface for a range of proportional enlargement factors and for regions varying in central latitude and latitudinal extent. Distortion from projection onto the sphere is found to be comparable with projection onto the plane for mid- to high-latitude regions of moderate geographic extent and proportional enlargement factors up to 25×. Several examples of sphere-to-sphere projection illustrate their potential uses and limitations.		Barry J.

Our approach extends the method of maximum entropy to use mea surement scale as a type of information constraint. We argue that a very common measu rement scale is linear at small magnitudes grading into logarithmic at large magnitudes, l ading to observations that often follow Student’s probability distribution which has a Gaus sian shape for small fluctuations from the mean and a power law shape for large fluctuations from the mean. An inverse scaling often arises in which measures naturally grade from logarithmic to linear as one moves from small to large magnitudes, leading to observatio ns that often follow a gamma probability distribution. A gamma distribution has a power law shape for small magnitudes and an exponential shape for large magnitudes. The two measu rement scales are natural inverses connected by the Laplace integral transform. This inversion connects the two major scaling patterns commonly found in nature. We also show that superstatistics is a special case of an integral transform, and thus can be understood as a p rticular way in which to change the scale of measurement. Incorporating informat ion bout measurement scale into maximum entropy provides a general approach to the rela tions between measurement, information and probability.	gamma correction;gaussian (software);image scaling;level of measurement;measurement invariance;principle of maximum entropy;store and forward;superstatistics;time complexity	Steven A.

ac0982b26620a5a75a4f2059746826e2caf7e6f6	on soft power diagrams		Many applications in data analysis begin with a set of points in a Euclidean space that is partitioned into clusters. Common tasks then a re to devise a classifier deciding which of the clusters a new point is associated to, find ing outliers with respect to the clusters, or identifying the type of clustering used f or the partition. One of the common kinds of clusterings are (balanced) leastsquares assignments with respect to a given set of sites. For these, there is a ’sep rating power diagram’ for which each cluster lies in its own cell. In the present paper, we aim for efficient algorithms for outl ier detection and the computation of thresholds that measure how similar a clu stering is to a leastsquares assignment for fixed sites. For this purpose, we devi se a new model for the computation of a ’soft power diagram’, which allows a soft se paration of the clusters with ’point counting properties’; e.g. we are able to prescr ibe how many points we want to classify as outliers. As our results hold for a more general non-convex model of fre e sites, we describe it and our proofs in this more general way. Its locally optimal solutions satisfy the aforementioned point counting properties. For our targ et applications that use fixed sites, our algorithms are efficiently solvable to globa l optimality by linear programming.	algorithm;cluster analysis;computation;decision problem;linear programming;local optimum;power diagram;statistical classification	Steffen Borgwardt	2015	J.

Equivalently, we cast the problem as the design of optimal channel input sequences for identifying a discrete channel under observation from a finite set of known channels. The optimality criterion that we employ is the exponent of the Bayesian probability of error. In our study, we consider a feedforward scenario where there is no feedback from the channel output to the signal selector at the channel input and a feedback scenario where the past channel outputs are revealed to the signal selector. In the feedforward scenario, only the type of the input sequence matters and our main result is an expression for the error exponent in terms of the limiting distribution of the input sequence. In the feedback case, we show that when discriminating between two channels, the optimal scheme in the first scenario is simultaneously the optimal time-invariant Markov feedback policy of any order.	error exponent;feedforward neural network;markov chain;optimality criterion;time-invariant system	Patrick Mitran;Aleksandar Kavcic	2006	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2005.860468	econometrics;pattern recognition;mathematics;error exponent;statistics;detection theory	Theory	49.603107779966074	12.782286651346627	25881

An estimate of ( ) based on a class of orthogonal and complete functions over the unit disk is proposed. This class of functions has a distinctive property of being invariant to rotation of axes about the origin of coordinates yielding therefore a rotationally invariant estimate. For radial functions, the orthogonal set has a particularly simple form being related to the classical Legendre polynomials. We give the statistical accuracy analysis of the proposed estimate of ( ) in the sense of the 2 metric. It is found that there is an inherent limitation in the precision of the estimate due to the geometric nature of a circular domain. This is explained by relating the accuracy issue to the celebrated problem in the analytic number theory called the lattice points of a circle. In fact, the obtained bounds for the mean integrated squared error are determined by the best known result so far on the problem of lattice points within the circular domain.	legendre polynomials;mean squared error;polynomial;radial (radio);signal-to-noise ratio;square tiling	Miros&#x0142;aw Pawlak;Simon X.

(statistical inference for fractional and multifractional brownian motions)		This thesis deals with statistical problems related to two parametric models: the fractional Brownian motion (fBm) and the multifractional Brownian motion (mBm). Firstly, we develop methods for identifying a fBm. These methods are based on the k-th absolute empirical moment of discrete variations of a discretized path of a fBm. We then extend this work by developping a robust method (with respect to an additive Gaussian noise) estimation of parameters, and present few tests for validating the model. We also prove a linear algebra result concerning inverses of matrices with terms decreasing hyperbolically far away from the diagonal. This result is fundamental to exhibit the asymptotic behavior of Cram er-Rao bounds for the parameters of a fBm. Finally, we propose a local approach of the results of the rst chapters, in order to identify the mBm, viewed as an extension of the fBm in the sense that the regularity of the process varies with time.

Since the conditions of Mercer's theorem are hard to verify some mathematical results arising from semi-simple Lie groups are collected here to provide concrete examples of Mercer kernels for the real line. Besides an interesting connection to Furstenberg's theory of noncommuting random products comes to light. These results have, in essence, been known for quite some time but are rather technical in nature. Hence a concise treatment is offered here to make them accessible to Neural Network researchers.	semiconductor industry;separation kernel	Bernd-Jürgen Falkowski	2003		10.1007/978-3-540-45224-9_44	combinatorics;mathematics;algebra	Vision	52.62472241428083	26.05643338574359	26020

Algorithms are presented for deciding convexity, identifying extreme points of convex hulls, and using extreme points in a variety of fashions. For a pyramid computer with a base ofn simple processing elements arranged in ann 1/2 ×n 1/2 square, the running times of the algorithms range from Θ(logn) to find the extreme points of a convex figure in a digitized picture, to Θ(n 1/6) to find the diameter of a labeled figure, Θ(n 1/4 logn) to find the extreme points of every figure in a digitized picture, to Θ(n 1/2) to find the extreme points of every labeled set of processing elements. Our results show that the pyramid computer can be used to obtain efficient solutions to nontrivial problems in image analysis. We also show the sensitivity of efficient pyramid-computer algorithms to the rate at which essential data can be compressed. Finally, we show that a wide variety of techniques are needed to make full and efficient use of the pyramid architecture.	image analysis;parallel algorithm	Russ Miller;Quentin F.

6e795817d77e5178febac7f4164fcd64ee833c1c	deriving bounds on the size of spatial areas		Many application domains such as surveillance, environmen tal monitoring or sensor-data processing need upper and lower bounds on areas that are covered by a certain featur . For example, a smart-city infrastructure might need bounds on the size of an area polluted with fine-dust, to re-ro ute combustion-engine traffic. Obtaining such bounds is challenging, because in almost any real-world applicati on, information about the region of interest is incomplete, e.g., the database of sensor data contains only a limited num ber of samples. Existing approaches cannot provide upper and lower bounds or depend on restrictive assumptions , e.g., the area must be convex. Our approach in turn is based on the natural assumption that it is possible to specify a minimal diameter for the feature in question. Given this assumption, we formally derive bounds on the area size, and we provide algorithms that compute these bounds from a database of sensor data, based on geometrical c onsiderations. We evaluate our algorithms both with a real-world case study and with synthetic data.

The distances are used to embed the graph-nodes in a low-dimensional space by performing Multidimensional Scaling(MDS). We perform an analysis of the distances, and demonstrate that they are related to the sectional curvature of the connecting geodesic on the manifold. Experiments with moment invariants computed from the embedded points show that they can be used for graph clustering.		Xiao Bai;Edwin R.

If AX is the number of FPLs with link pattern X, the Razumov-Stroganov correspondence provides relations between numbers AX relative to a given grid size. In another line of research, if [email protected]?p denotes X with p additional nested arches, then AX@?p was shown to be polynomial in p: the proof gives rise to certain configurations of FPLs in a triangle (TFPLs). In this work we investigate these TFPL configurations and their relation to FPLs. We prove certain properties of TFPLs, and enumerate them under special boundary conditions. From this study we deduce a class of linear relations, conjectured by Thapper, between quantities AX relative to different grid sizes, relations which thus differ from the Razumov-Stroganov ones.

Network-on-chip (NoC) has emerged as a viable alternative to unplug the communication bottleneck in system-on-chip. In the NoC synthesis flow, IP block mapping problem is one of the holistic research problems, which aims to minimize the overall communication cost or power consumption of the network. Since mesh is a well-accepted topology, we focus on IP mapping problem onto mesh-based NoCs in this paper. The IP mapping problem is proven to be NP-hard. No exact algorithm is expected to solve it in the polynomial time, and considerable computation time is required for even small-scale instances. In this paper, we analyze the symmetry character in mesh and propose an adaptive memetic algorithm (AMA) to solve the application mapping problem. The novel AMA method integrates both global and local optimization techniques, which contributes to the effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithm. Experiments have been carried out under both real application and synthetic benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that the proposed AMA outperforms the existing heuristics (CastNet and genetic algorithm) in the aspects of solution quality and power consumption. Within acceptable time limit, AMA could obtain optimal or suboptimal solutions when compared with the exact algorithm.	benchmark (computing);block (data storage);computation;die (integrated circuit);exact algorithm;genetic algorithm;graph embedding;heuristic (computer science);holism;ip address blocking;local search (optimization);mathematical optimization;memetic algorithm;mesh networking;np-hardness;network on a chip;one-to-one (data model);polynomial;software release life cycle;synthetic intelligence;system on a chip;time complexity	Xinyu Wang;Haikuo Liu;Zhigang Yu	2016	The Journal of Supercomputing	10.1007/s11227-016-1719-6	mathematical optimization;computer science;theoretical computer science;algorithm;memetic algorithm	EDA	26.074861104186127	6.4429694858059525	26206

Sensor selection is an important design problem as the number of sensors is often limited by resource or economical constraints. In this work, the sensor selection problem for non-linear measurement models in additive Gaussian noise is considered. For this purpose, a greedy algorithm based on two submodular cost functions, namely the weighted frame potential and the weighted log-det, is developed. The proposed greedy algorithm is computationally attractive as compared to existing sensor selection solvers for non-linear models. The submodular cost ensures near-optimality of the greedy algorithm.	additive white gaussian noise;greedy algorithm;linear model;non-deterministic turing machine;nonlinear system;selection algorithm;sensor;submodular set function;utility functions on indivisible goods	Shilpa Rao;Sundeep Prabhakar Chepuri;Geert Leus	2015	2015 IEEE 6th International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)	10.1109/CAMSAP.2015.7383781	greedy randomized adaptive search procedure;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;greedy algorithm;maximum coverage problem;machine learning;mathematics	Robotics	48.5562524386276	5.368215804501125	26239

Generalizing the Nash-Williams Arboricity Theorem, the Nine Dragon Tree Conjecture asserts that if Arb(G) ≤ k + d k+d+1 , then G decomposes into k + 1 forests with one having maximum degree at most d . The conjecture was previously proved for (k, d ) ∈ {(1, 1), (1, 2)}; we prove it for d = k + 1 and when k = 1 and d ≤ 6. For (k, d ) = (1, 2), we can further restrict one forest to have at most two edges in each component. For general (k, d ), we prove weaker conclusions. If d > k, then Arb(G) ≤ k + d k+d+1 implies that G decomposes into k forests plus a multigraph (not necessarily a forest) with maximum degree at most d . If d ≤ k, then Arb(G) ≤ k + d 2k+2 implies that G decomposes into k + 1 forests, one having maximum degree at most d . Our results generalize earlier results about decomposition of sparse planar graphs. C © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J.

In this paper, we show that the problem is NP-hard when the regions are fat (even when they are axis-aligned rectangles of aspect ratio 1 : (1+ε)). We also show that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) for such regions. Using our FPT algorithm, we show that if the regions are β-fat and their arrangement has bounded ply ∆, there is a (1+ε)-approximation that runs in O(2n) time, where f ∈ O(∆2β6 ε4 log(β∆/ε)).	algorithm;apache axis;apollonian network;barrier resilience;cobham's thesis;file allocation table;np-hardness;parameterized complexity	Matias Korman;Maarten Löffler;Rodrigo I.

From the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, N can be identified with a lattice of functions from the set of primes to the complete chain {0, 1, 2, ...,+∞}, thus our knowledge about (divisible) t-norms on this chain can be applied to the study of t-norms on N. A characterization of those t-norms on N which are a direct product of t-norms on {0, 1, 2, ...,+∞} is given and, after introducing the concept of T -prime (prime with respect to a t-norm T ), a theorem about the existence of a T -prime decomposition is obtained.

The cardinality of any smallest dominating set in G is denoted by (G) and called the domination number of G. Graph G is said to be -vertex-critical if (G − v) < (G), for every vertex v in G. A graph G is said to be factor-critical if G − v has a perfect matching for every choice of v ∈ V (G). In this paper, we present two main results about 3-vertex-critical graphs of odd order. First we show that any such graph with positive minimum degree and at least 11 vertices which has no induced subgraph isomorphic to the bipartite graph K1,5 must contain a near-perfect matching. Secondly, we show that any such graph with minimum degree at least three which has no induced subgraph isomorphic to the bipartite graph K1,4 must be factor-critical. We then show that these results are best possible in several senses and close with a conjecture. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

A set  P  of  n  points in  d -dimensional Euclidean space E  d   is δ- dense , if the ratio of the largest to the smallest distance between any two points of  P  is bounded by   δn      1  d    , with some constant δ. We describe a simple, yet efficient algorithm to compute an approximate center point for a δ-dense set  P  in time O( dn ). The quality of the approximation depends on δ and exponentially on the dimension  d , where the absolute value of the exponent is in   Ω(d log d)  .

The goal is to assign signs to the graph’s edges so that a maximum number of pairs admit a source-to-target path whose aggregate sign (product of its edge signs) equals the pair’s sign. This problem arises in the annotation of physical interaction networks with activation/repression signs. It is known to be NP-complete and most previous approaches to tackle it were limited to considering very short paths in the network. Here we provide a sign assignment algorithm that solves the problem to optimality by reformulating it as an integer program. We apply our algorithm to sign physical interactions in yeast and measure our performance using edges whose activation/repression signs are known. We find that our algorithm achieves high accuracy (89%), outperforming a state-of-the-art method by a significant margin.	aggregate data;algorithm;assignment problem;fundamental interaction;graph (discrete mathematics);human–computer interaction;integer programming	Shay Houri;Roded Sharan	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-33122-0_27	protein–protein interaction;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;psychological repression;mathematics;algorithm	ML	24.660145543552566	23.415568350601447	26793

It is relatively easy to measure the received signal strength (RSS), but RSS localization is generally less accurate than angle-of-arrival (AOA) localization in most practical environments. When both RSS and AOA are available, fusing their measurements can improve localization accuracy. This paper develops a set of linear equations that optimally combines both AOA and RSS measurements, and is suitable for solution by weighted least squares. The simulation results show that at sufficiently low noise, the hybrid scheme is near optimal.	angle of arrival;fisher information;formation matrix;lambert's cosine law;least squares;linear equation;rss;sensor;simulation;the matrix	Yiu-Tong Chan;François Chan;William Read;Brad R.

Furthermore, it is very efficient in its use of so-called support structures that are generated by the LM process. This paper presents the first provably correct and efficient geometric algorithms to decompose polyhedral models so that the support requirements (support volume and area of contact) are minimized. Algorithms based on the plane-sweep paradigm are first given for convex polyhedra. These algorithms run in O ( logn) time for n-vertex convex polyhedra and work by generating expressions for the support volume and contact-area as a function of the height of the sweep plane, and optimizing them during the sweep. These algorithms are then generalized to nonconvex polyhedra, which are considerably more difficult due to the complex structure of the supports. It is shown that, surprisingly, non-convex polyhedra can be handled by first identifying certain critical facets using a technique called cylindrical decomposition, and then applying the algorithm for convex polyhedra to these critical facets. The resulting algorithms run in O (n2 logn) time. Also given is a method for controlling the size of the decomposition, so that the number of pieces generated is within a user-specified limit. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve significant reduction in support requirements in both the convex and the non-convex case.  2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

It is ordered if the edges to children appear in prescribed order around each vertex. It is well-known that any tree has an upward (unordered) drawing with width log(n+ 1). For ordered drawings, the best-known bounds for the width for binary trees is O(logn), while for arbitrary trees it is O(2 √ ). We present algorithms that compute upward drawings with instanceoptimal width, i.e., the width is the minimum-possible for the input tree. In this first paper, we mostly study unordered drawings, where the algorithm is very simple and the drawings obtained are straight-line. We also give 2-approximation algorithms for the width of upward ordered drawings, and O(∆)-approximation where additionally the height is small. In particular any tree has an upward straight-line ordered drawing of area O(∆n logn).	algorithm;binary tree;pathwidth	Therese C.

Icard later introduced a family of topologies $\mathcal I_\lambda$ for $\lambda < \omega$, with the purpose of providing semantics for Japaridze's polymodal logic $\sf{GLP}$ $_{\omega}$. Icard's construction was later extended by Joosten and the second author to arbitrary ordinals $\lambda \geq \omega$. #R##N#We further generalize Icard topologies in this article. Given a scattered space $\mathfrak X = (X, \tau)$ and an ordinal $\lambda$, we define a topology $\tau_{+\lambda}$ in such a way that $\tau_{+0}$ is the original topology $\tau$ and $\tau_{+\lambda}$ coincides with $\mathcal I_\lambda$ when $\mathfrak X$ is an ordinal endowed with the left topology. #R##N#We then prove that, given any scattered space $\mathfrak X$ and any ordinal $\lambda>0$ such that the rank of $(X, \tau)$ is large enough, $\sf{GL}$ is strongly complete for $\tau_{+\lambda}$. One obtains the original Abashidze-Blass theorem as a consequence of the special case where $\mathfrak X=\omega^\omega$ and $\lambda=1$.	ordinal data;provability logic;spaces	Juan P.

ded97ecceeae9346d355e10ba28930b772e1d68e	scott's induced subdivision conjecture for maximal triangle-free graphs	05c15	Scott conjectured in [6] that the class of graphs with no induced subdivision of a given graph is χ-bounded. We verify his conjecture for maximal triangle-free graphs. Let F be a graph. We denote by Forb∗(F ) the class of graphs with no induced subdivision of F . A class G of graphs is χ-bounded if there exists a function f such that every graph G of G satisfies χ(G) ≤ f(ω(G)), where χ and ω respectively denote the chromatic number and the clique number of G. Gyárfás conjectured that Forb∗(F ) is χ-bounded if F is a cycle [3]. Scott proved that for each tree T , Forb∗(T ) is χ-bounded and conjectured the following [6]. Conjecture 1. For every graph F , Forb∗(F ) is χ-bounded. This question is open for triangle-free graphs, which is probably the core of the problem. It also has nice corollaries, for instance it would imply that any collection of segments in the plane with no three of them pairwise intersecting can be partitioned into a bounded number of non intersecting sets of segment. This is a well-known question of Erdős, first cited in [3]. Our goal is to prove Scott’s conjecture for triangle-free graphs with diameter two, i.e. maximal triangle-free graphs. Theorem 2. Let F be a graph of size l. Every maximal triangle-free graph G with χ(G) ≥ eθ(l4) contains an induced subdivision of F . Proof. Let H be the neighborhood hypergraph of G, i.e. the hypergraph with vertex set V and with hyperedges the closed neighborhoods of the vertices of G. Observe that H has packing number one, i.e. its hyperedges pairwise intersect. Note also that if the transversality of H is t (minimum size of a set of vertices intersecting all hyperedges), then χ(G) ≤ 2t. Indeed, G can be covered by t closed neighborhoods, hence by t induced stars since G is triangle-free. Since χ(G) ≥ eθ(l4), the transversality of H is at least eθ(l 4). Ding, Seymour and Winkler [2] proved that if a hypergraph H has packing number one and transversality greater than 11d2(d + 4)(d + 1)2, it contains d hyperedges e1, . . . , ed and a set of vertices Y = {yi,j : 1 ≤ i < j ≤ d} such that yi,j ∈ ei ∩ ej and yi,j / ∈ ek for all k 6= i, j. Since the transversality of H is at least eθ(l 4), we have such a collection of hyperedges e1, . . . , ed with d ≥ eθ(l4).	clique (graph theory);erdős number;graph (discrete mathematics);graph coloring;maximal set;neighbourhood (graph theory);set packing;subdivision surface;transversality (mathematics);vertex (geometry);vertex (graph theory)	Nicolas Bousquet;Stéphan Thomassé	2012	Combinatorics, Probability & Computing	10.1017/S0963548312000065	strong perfect graph theorem;lonely runner conjecture;1-planar graph;pathwidth;split graph;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;cograph;topology;dense graph;graph coloring;clique-sum;mathematics;maximal independent set;chordal graph;indifference graph	Theory	29.30961441542731	27.753951988526563	27316

490f8b5a31fcbdf93734c012655822d982176f68	vertex similarity - a basic framework for matching geometric graphs		Solutions to the graph matching problem play an important role in many application domains, such as chemistry, proteomics, or image processing. Especially in these domains, graphs have geometric properties that describe the positions of the vertices in some 2or 3dimensional space. Several exact and approximate approaches have been proposed to address the problem of matching graphs, which is known to be NP-hard in general. For this, most approaches depend on the concept of vertex similarity to iteratively increase the matching quality. In this paper, we study the vertex similarity problem for geometric graphs. We formally define such a problem and prove that its complexity is NP-hard. For geometric graphs in 2D, we propose an approximate solution with polynomial runtime. For this, we utilize techniques underlying attributed cyclic string matching and customized edit operations that consider spatial properties and labeling information. In our evaluations, we show that our approach outperforms existing vertex similarity approaches in terms of classification accuracy and matching quality.	approximation algorithm;edit distance;geometric graph theory;image processing;matching (graph theory);np-hardness;optical character recognition;polynomial;proteomics;string searching algorithm;time complexity;vertex (geometry);vertex (graph theory)	Ayser Armiti;Michael Gertz	2014			combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;bipartite graph;vertex cover;3-dimensional matching;vertex;mathematics;chordal graph	DB	25.228286188263883	22.090568725494077	27406
1329b535e60bc055aac8a5b48b3c75e31acd75de	pebbling and optimal pebbling in graphs	cycle;hypercube;connected graph;tree	Given a distribution of pebbles on the vertices of a graph G, a pebbling move takes two pebbles from one vertex and puts one on a neighboring vertex. The pebbling number Π (G) is the minimum k such that for every distribution of k pebbles and every vertex r, it is possible to move a pebble to r. The optimal pebbling number ΠOPT (G) is the minimum k such that some distribution of k pebbles permits reaching each vertex. We give short proofs of prior results on these parameters for paths, cycles, trees, and hypercubes, a linear-time algorithm for computing Π (G) on trees, and new results on the ΠOPT (G). For a connected n-vertex graph G, we prove that ΠOPT (G) ≤ d2n/3e, with equality for paths and cycles. Also, if G denotes the family of n-vertex connected graphs with minimum degree k, then 2.4 ≤ maxG∈G ΠOPT (G) k+1 n ≤ 4 when k > 15 and k is a multiple of 3. Finally, ΠOPT (G) ≤ 4tn/((k−1)t+4t) when G is a connected n-vertex graph with minimum degree k and girth at least 2t + 1. For t = 2, a more precise version of the bound is ΠOPT (G) ≤ 16n/(k2 + 17).	algorithm;girth (graph theory);pebble smartwatch;time complexity	David P. Bunde;Erin W. Chambers;Daniel W.

04154a2edcc57702ec23edfdc3d3c90dac0a7c1b	lp-based pivoting algorithm for higher-order correlation clustering		Correlation clustering is an approach for clustering a set of objects from given pairwise information. In this approach, the given pairwise information is usually represented by an undirected graph with nodes corresponding to the objects, where each edge in the graph is assigned a nonnegative weight, and either the positive or negative label. Then, a clustering is obtained by solving an optimization problem of finding a partition of the node set that minimizes the disagreement or maximizes the agreement with the pairwise information. In this paper, we extend correlation clustering with disagreement minimization to deal with higher-order relationships represented by hypergraphs. We give two pivoting algorithms based on a linear programming relaxation of the problem. One achieves an (O(k log n))-approximation, where n is the number of nodes and k is the maximum size of hyperedges with the negative labels. This algorithm can be applied to any hyperedges with arbitrary weights. The other is an O(r)-approximation for complete r-partite hypergraphs with uniform weights. This type of hypergraphs arise from the coclustering setting of correlation clustering.	algorithm;computer cluster;correlation clustering;higher-order function	Takuro Fukunaga	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-94776-1_5	discrete mathematics;combinatorics;correlation clustering;computer science;binary logarithm;linear programming relaxation;algorithm;constraint graph;cluster analysis;pairwise comparison;partition (number theory);optimization problem	DB	25.591038689935814	20.525836226445	27466

The goal is to synthesize concrete values of the fixed-delays (timeouts) that minimize the expected total cost incurred before reaching a given set of target states. The same problem has been considered and solved in previous works by computing an optimal policy in a certain discrete-time Markov decision process (MDP) with a huge number of actions that correspond to suitably discretized values of the timeouts. In this paper, we design a symbolic fixed-delay synthesis algorithm which avoids the explicit construction of large action spaces. Instead, the algorithm computes a small sets of """"promising"""" candidate actions on demand. The candidate actions are selected by minimizing a certain objective function by computing its symbolic derivative and extracting a univariate polynomial whose roots are precisely the points where the derivative takes zero value. Since roots of high degree univariate polynomials can be isolated very efficiently using modern mathematical software, we achieve not only drastic memory savings but also speedup by three orders of magnitude compared to the previous methods."""	algorithm;discretization;iteration;loss function;markov chain;markov decision process;mathematical software;optimization problem;polynomial;speedup;timeout (computing)	Lubos Korenciak;Antonín Kucera;Vojtech Rehák	2016	2016 IEEE 24th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS)	10.1109/MASCOTS.2016.34	communications protocol;mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;computer science;mathematics;markov process;computational model;algorithm;statistics	Logic	39.91100737264389	4.939934528144289	27482

The emphasis is usually on embeddings with the least possible distortion. That is, one seeks an embedding that minimizes the bi-Lipschitz constant of the mapping. This question has also been asked for embeddings into other normed spaces. However, when the host space is l2 , more can be said: The problem of finding an optimal embedding into l2 can be formulated as a semidefinite program (and can therefore be solved in polynomial time). So far, this elegant statement of the problem has not been applied to any interesting explicit instances. Here we employ this method and examine two families of graphs: (i) products of cycles, and (ii) constant-degree expander graphs. Our results in (i) extend a 30-year-old result of P. Enflo (1969, Ark. Mat. 8, 103 105) on the cube. Our results in (ii) provide an alternative proof to the fact that there are n-point metric spaces whose Euclidean distortion is 0(log n). Furthermore, we show that metrics in the class (ii) are 0(log n) far from the class l2 , namely, the square of the metrics realizable in l2 . This is a well studied class which contains all l1 metrics (and therefore also all l2 metrics). Some of our methods may well apply to more general instances where semidefinite programming is used to estimate Euclidean distortions. Specifically, we develop a method for proving the optimality of an embedding. This idea is useful in those cases where it is possible to guess an optimal embedding. 2000 Academic Press	approximation algorithm;distortion;euclidean distance;graph (discrete mathematics);graph theory;principle of locality;semidefinite programming;software metric;time complexity	Nathan Linial;Avner Magen	2000	J.

Angle-monotone graphs are √ 2-spanners and they are increasing-chord graphs. Dehkordi, Frati, and Gudmundsson introduced anglemonotone graphs in 2014 and proved that Gabriel triangulations are angle-monotone graphs. We give a polynomial time algorithm to recognize angle-monotone geometric graphs. We prove that every point set has a plane geometric graph that is generalized angle-monotone—specifically, we prove that the half-θ6-graph is generalized angle-monotone. We give a local routing algorithm for Gabriel triangulations that finds a path from any vertex s to any vertex t whose length is within 1 + √ 2 times the Euclidean distance from s to t. Finally, we prove some lower bounds and limits on local routing algorithms on Gabriel triangulations.	algorithm;euclidean distance;geometric graph theory;p (complexity);routing;monotone	Nicolas Bonichon;Prosenjit Bose;Paz Carmi;Irina Kostitsyna;Anna Lubiw;Sander Verdonschot	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-50106-2_40	1-planar graph;pathwidth;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;longest path problem;mathematics;maximal independent set;chordal graph;indifference graph	Theory	28.252914744506704	21.458617364555177	27551

An important role in this investigation is played by the Lorenz curve of concentration and the majorization poset. This leads to a number of relations between the total number of sources, the total number of items, the average production, and the maximum production of an IPP, when one or several of these quantities show an evolution in time. We also establish a relation between the 80/20 rule and the Lorenz dominance order. We conclude that Lorenz curves and the majorization poset are important tools in the investigation of evolution and growth.	abstract interpretation;evolution;incidence poset;informetrics;lorenz cipher	Leo Egghe;Ronald Rousseau	1993	Inf.

In the case of tree-width, the restriction to minor-closed classes is justified by the fact that the tree-width of a graph is never smaller than the tree-width of any of its minors. This, however, is not the case with respect to clique-width, as the clique-width of a graph can be (much) smaller than the clique-width of its minor. On the other hand, the clique-width of a graph is never smaller than the clique-width of any of its induced subgraphs, which allows us to be restricted to hereditary classes (that is, classes closed under taking induced subgraphs), when we study clique-width. Up to date, only finitely many minimal hereditary classes of graphs of unbounded clique-width have been discovered in the literature. In the present paper, we prove that the family of such classes is infinite. Moreover, we show that the same is true with respect to linear clique-width.	clique-width;existential quantification;hereditary property;induced subgraph;planar graph;treewidth	Andrew Collins;Jan Foniok;Nicholas Korpelainen;Vadim V.

We propose a novel technique to approximate a multi-scale filtration of the Rips complex with improved bounds for size: precisely, for n points in Rd, we obtain a O(d)approximation with at most n2O(d log k) simplices of dimension k or lower. In conjunction with dimension reduction techniques, our approach yields a O(polylog(n))approximation of size nO(1) for Rips filtrations on arbitrary metric spaces. This result stems from high-dimensional lattice geometry and exploits properties of the permutahedral lattice, a well-studied structure in discrete geometry. Building on the same geometric concept, we also present a lower bound result on the size of an approximate filtration: we construct a point set for which every (1 + ε)approximation of the Čech filtration has to contain nΩ(log logn) features, provided that ε < 1 log n for c ∈ (0, 1).	approximation algorithm;dimensionality reduction;point cloud;polynomial;vietoris–rips complex	Aruni Choudhary;Michael Kerber;Sharath Raghvendra	2016		10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2016.31	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;computational geometry;mathematics;geometry;algebraic topology	Theory	35.275677559498305	19.110737167328768	27749
788cdc8ad5647f2ac93e339ceda5898336f7dd03	tight stretch factors for l1- and l∞-delaunay triangulations	delaunay triangulation	Abstract In this paper we determine the exact stretch factor of L ∞ -Delaunay triangulations of points in the plane. We do this not only when the distance between the points is defined by the usual L 2 -metric but also when it is defined by the L p -metric, for any p ∈ [ 1 , ∞ ] . We then apply this result to compute the exact stretch factor of L 1 -Delaunay triangulations when the distance between the points is defined by the L 1 -, L ∞ -, or L 2 -metric. In the important case of the L 2 -metric, we obtain that the stretch factor of L 1 -Delaunay and L ∞ -Delaunay triangulations is exactly 4 + 2 2 ≈ 2.61 . This is the first time that the stretch factor of an L p -Delaunay triangulation, for any p ∈ [ 1 , ∞ ] , is determined exactly. We show, in particular, how to construct between any two points a and b of an L 1 -Delaunay or L ∞ -Delaunay triangulation a path whose length is no more than 4 + 2 2 times the Euclidean distance between a and b . This improves the bound of 10 by Chew (SoCG u002786) [5] . We also describe families of point sets whose L 1 -Delaunay or L ∞ -Delaunay triangulation has a stretch factor that can be made arbitrarily close to 4 + 2 2 .	delaunay triangulation	Nicolas Bonichon;Cyril Gavoille;Nicolas Hanusse;Ljubomir Perkovic	2015	Comput.

We establish#R##N#corresponding characterisations in the cases of JW∗-triples and of TROs (regarded as JC∗-triples). We show that the distinct natural operator space structures on a universally reversible JC∗-triple E are in bijective correspondence with a distinguished class of ideals in its universal TRO, identify the Shilov boundaries of these operator spaces and prove that E has a unique natural operator space structure precisely when E contains no ideal isometric to a nonabelian TRO. We deduce some decomposition and completely contractive properties of triple homomorphisms on TROs.		Leslie J. Bunce;Richard M. Timoney	2013	J. London Math.

Although SIR and SIS are basic epidemic models, deductions from their exact stochastic equations without making approximations (such as the common mean-field approximation) are scarce. An exact analytic solution of the governing equations is highly unlikely to be found (for any network) due to the appearing pair (and higher order) correlations. Nevertheless, the maximum average fraction yI of infected nodes in both SIS and SIR can be written as a quadratic form of the graph's Laplacian. Only for regular graphs, the expression for the maximum of yI can be simplified to exhibit the explicit dependence on the spectral radius. From our new Laplacian expression, we deduce a general upper bound for the epidemic SIS threshold in any graph.	approximation;bernoulli polynomials	Piet Van Mieghem;Faryad Darabi Sahneh;Caterina M.

Furthermore, the expressions for the probabilities of the false alarm and detection are derived, and the validity of them is confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations. The assessment results show that the proposed detector outperforms the conventional unstructured GLRT, the structured persymmetric adaptive matched filter and the persymmetric Rao detector, especially in the training-deficient scenarios.

This solution provides a finite algorithm for satisfying a necessary condition in the search for a simplicial (fewest states) stochastic sequential machine (SSM) which either covers or is covered by a given SSM of rank three. Theorems are proved which establish necessary and sufficient conditions restricting the class of corresponding simplexes through which a search must proceed to those whose vertices lie in the boundary of the bounding polytope and whose facet-supporting flats contain certain specified vertices of the polytope to be covered. The problem is then reduced to testing roots in the finite solution tree of a set of second degree algebraic equations against a finite table of linear constraints. An algorithm to generate the constraint sets for the equations to be solved is also presented along with examples of its application.	algebraic equation;algorithm;decision problem;effective method;vertex (geometry)	Charles B.

Algorithms have been introduced to detect (i) open contours in images in quadratic time (ii) closed contours in images in cubic time, and (iii) tree structures from contours in quadratic time. The algorithms are based on dynamic programming and single source shortest path algorithms. However, in this paper, we show that the problem of finding tree structures in images in a principled manner is a much harder problem. We argue that the optimization problem of finding tree structures in images is essentially equivalent to a variant of the Steiner tree problem, which is NP-hard. Nevertheless, an approximate polynomial-time algorithm for this problem exists: we apply a fast implementation of the Goemans-Williamson approximate algorithm to the problem of finding a tree representation after an image is transformed by a local symmetry mapping.

We show transfer results from individual groups to graph products. We concentrate on logspace complexity because the challenge is actually in small complexity classes, only. The most difficult transfer result is for the conjugacy problem. We have a general result for graph products, but even in the special case of a graph group the result is new. Graph groups are closely linked to the theory of Mazurkiewicz traces which form an algebraic model for concurrent processes. Our proofs are combinatorial and based on well-known concepts in trace theory. We also use rewriting techniques over traces. For the group-theoretical part we apply Bass-Serre theory. But as we need explicit formulae and as we design concrete algorithms all our group-theoretical calculations are completely explicit and accessible to non-specialists.	computation;graph product;l (complexity)	Volker Diekert;Jonathan Kausch	2016	J.

Main results: An essentially periodic group   G   is abelian; if   G   is discrete, then definable functions in one variable are ultimately piecewise linear. A group such that every model elementarily equivalent to it is coset-minimal is quasi-  o  -minimal (and vice versa), and its definable functions in one variable are piecewise linear.

If properly chosen, the number of measurements can be significantly smaller than the ambient dimension of the signal and yet preserve the significant signal information. Interestingly, it can be shown that random measurement schemes provide a near-optimal encoding in terms of the required number of measurements. In this report, we explore another relatively unexplored, though often alluded to, advantage of using random matrices to acquire CS measurements. Specifically, we show that random matrices are democractic, meaning that each measurement carries roughly the same amount of signal information. We demonstrate that by slightly increasing the number of measurements, the system is robust to the loss of a small number of arbitrary measurements. In addition, we draw connections to oversampling and demonstrate stability from the loss of significantly more measurements.	compressed sensing;oversampling;random access;sparse matrix	Mark A.

To establish these connections, we prove a formula to compute the Euler characteristic of an arbitrary simplicial complex from a set of generators of its Stanley-Reisner ideal.	dominating set;euler characteristic;independent set (graph theory);simplicial complex;the stanley parable	Mario Marietti;Damiano Testa	2012	Eur.

Conventional radar detection techniques involve testing each test cell separately at a predefined probability of false alarm. In this paper, we formulate a novel surveillance paradigm that controls the false discovery rate (FDR) for a specified surveillance area (SA), which consists of a number of test cells. FDR is defined as the expectation of the ratio of the number of false alarms to the total number of cells classified as targets over the entire SA. It is observed that control of FDR results in an increase in the probabilities of detection and false alarm with an increase in the number of targets in the SA. This is achieved without the actual knowledge of the number of targets in the SA. To control the increase of the probability of false alarm and to confine it within a prespecified range, we propose a hybrid detection strategy involving both SA-based testing and per-cell testing. Our proposed hybrid approach, based on the concept of algorithm fusion, provides substantial improvement in detection performance in target-rich environments at the cost of a controlled increase in the false alarm rate. Analytical and simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.	algorithm;clutter;programming paradigm;radar;simulation	Priyadip Ray;Pramod K.

We prove several robustness and idempotence results concerning the Weihrauch degree of LAY, and we show that layerwise computability is more restrictive than Weihrauch reducibility to LAY. Along similar lines we also study the principle RD, a variant of LAY outputting the precise randomness deficiency of sequences instead of only an upper bound as LAY.	angular defect;computability;idempotence;randomness;ruby document format;universality probability	Rupert Hölzl;Paul Shafer	2015	Ann.

This is an exponential improvement over the previous, doubly-logarithmic, lower bound of [Andoni-Krauthgamer, FOCS'07]. Our lower bound also applies to the Ulam distance (edit distance over non-repetitive strings). In this special case, it is polynomially related to the recent upper bound of [Andoni-Indyk-Krauthgamer, SODA'09].  From a technical perspective, we prove a direct-sum theorem for sketching product metrics that is of independent interest. We show that, for any metric X that requires sketch size which is a sufficiently large constant, sketching the max-product metric ld∞(X) requires Ω(d) bits. The conclusion, in fact, also holds for arbitrary two-way communication. The proof uses a novel technique for information complexity based on Poincaré inequalities and suggests an intimate connection between non-embeddability, sketching and communication complexity.	approximation;communication complexity;edit distance;information-based complexity;time complexity	Alexandr Andoni;T.

149e1d7a4f4bf9ac7a4060f50134aab925e1db3a	on variants of a theorem of schur		In a paper [1] published in 2001, we modified a famous theorem of Issai Schur, which asserts that if G is a group with center Z, such that G/Z is finite, then the commutator subgroup G′ = [G,G] is also finite. Our modification was twofold; in the first place, we confined ourselves to nilpotent groups G, so that we could use effective localization methods at an arbitrary family P of primes, and, second, we relativized the situation by replacing G by a pair of groups (G,N), where N is a normal subgroup of G. Then Z was replaced by the centralizer CG(N) of N in G, and [G,G] was replaced by [G,N]. We also considered in [1] a partial converse of Schur’s theorem and its modification. In this partial converse, we showed that G/Z is finite if G′ is finite, provided that G is finitely generated (fg). In talks the author has given on this topic, he has expressed the opinion that the converse would not hold without some supplementary hypothesis. This remark was taken up by Dr. Edwin Clark of the University of South Florida, who raised the question on sci.math.research, and quickly received negative answers from Derek Holt and Andreas Caronti, whose counterexamples were very similar, being infinite extraspecial pgroups. Thus Holt considered a group G with generators xi, yi, i > 0, and z, subject to the relations x p i = y i = zp = 1, [xi,xj] = [yi, yj] = 1, and [xi, yi] = z, [xi, yj] = 1, i = j, and [z,xi] = [z, yi] = 1, for all i. Then Z = G′ = 〈z〉 is finite, but G/Z is infinite. The present author is very grateful to Edwin Clark for providing this elucidation. In Section 2, we provide improved versions of the proofs of the two main theorems of [1], namely, if P is a family of primes with complementary family Q, then Theorems 2.1 and 2.3 hold. It is a striking fact, not brought out in [1], that, whereas the proof of Theorem 2.1 leans heavily on the P-localization theory of nilpotent groups, the proof of Theorem 2.3 does not use localization methods.	internationalization and localization	Peter Hilton	2005	Int.

8abd013cdd6aa091dd22a3f5b6110ad2e92aba8f	low-complexity optimization for two-dimensional direction-of-arrival estimation via decoupled atomic norm minimization		This paper presents an efficient optimization technique for super-resolution two-dimensional (2D) direction of arrival (DOA) estimation by introducing a new formulation of atomic norm minimization (ANM). ANM allows gridless angle estimation for correlated sources even when the number of snapshots is far less than the antenna size, yet it incurs huge computational cost in 2D processing. This paper introduces a novel formulation of ANM via semi-definite programming, which expresses the original high-dimensional problem by two decoupled Toeplitz matrices in one dimension, followed by 1D angle estimation with automatic angle pairing. Compared with the state-of-the-art 2D ANM, the proposed technique reduces the computational complexity by several orders of magnitude with respect to the antenna size, while retaining the benefits of ANMin terms of super-resolution performance with use of a small number of measurements, and robustness to source correlation and noise. The complexity benefits are particularly attractive for large-scale antenna systems such as massive MIMO and radio astronomy.	algorithmic efficiency;computational complexity theory;direction of arrival;mimo;mathematical optimization;semiconductor industry;semidefinite programming;super-resolution imaging;toeplitz hash algorithm	Zhi Tian;Zhe Zhang;Yue Wang	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7952721	mimo;mathematical optimization;robustness (computer science);minification;computational complexity theory;toeplitz matrix;computer science;matrix (mathematics);matrix decomposition;direction of arrival	Vision	53.484262221729225	7.213642289974877	28771
40e97a6f7cd9e941c9c5ffbd99def0a19cc9a2fb	technical note - equivalence of the 0-1 integer programming problem to discrete generalized and pure networks	integer program	We show how to formulate a 0-1 integer programming problem as a “mixed integer” generalized network and as a discrete “0-U” pure network problem. Special integer programming structures allow convenient simplifications. The usefulness of these formulations is in providing new relaxations for integer programming that can take advantage of recent advances in the development of efficient computer programs for network problems. We cite three practical applications in which these ideas have led to marked improvement in solution efficiency.	turing completeness	Fred Glover;John M.

Unlike R, the new models can represent a bounded region of space using only finitely many cells, so they can be manipulated directly. Unlike Z n , they have useful notions of function continuity and region connectedness. Finally, the topology of space is allowed to depend on the situation being represented, accounting for sharp changes in function values and lack of connectedness across object boundaries.	scott continuity	Margaret M.

We show that for connected diagrams the leftand right-handed exchanges each give strongly normalizing rewrite strategies. We show that these strategies terminate in O(n) steps where n is the number of vertices. We also give an algorithm to directly construct the normal form, and hence determine isotopy, in O(n ·m) time, where m is the number of edges.	algorithm;beta normal form;connected component (graph theory);diagram;neighbourhood (graph theory);normalization property (abstract rewriting);rewrite (programming);terminate (software)	Antonin Delpeuch;Jamie Vicary	2018	CoRR		combinatorics;vertex (geometry);mathematics;isotopy;left and right;planar	Theory	34.972867613343055	23.66081066438632	28831

A remarkably simple expression is developed for the spectral covariance matrix in the neighborhood of the emitters. The covarijjnce result together with prior mean spectral results support a Gaussian characterization in the neighborhood of the emitters for many scenarios. It is shown that the sample spectrum is exactly Wishart distributed in the emitter directions. The results can be utilized to quantify a variety of performance metrics. As an illustration, models based upon physical parameters are constructed for the curve of probability of resolution versus signal-to-noise ratio. The models predict the curve with a high degree of accuracy for example scenarios.	lambert's cosine law;monomial;signal-to-noise ratio	Harry B. Lee;Michael S. Wengrovitz	1991	IEEE Trans.

We present an o­ ine, greedy, iterative algorithm which performs guaranteed search, i.e. no matter how the evader moves, it will eventually be captured; in fact our algorithm can be applied to either an adversarial (actively trying to avoid capture) or randomly moving evader. Furthermore the algorithm produces an internal search (the searchers move only along the edges of the graph, teleporting is not used) and can accommodate extended(across nodes) visibility and nite or innite evader speed. We present search experiments for several indoor environments, some of them quite complicated, in all of which the algorithm succeeds in clearing the graph (i.e. capturing the evader).	evasion (network security);experiment;graph theory;graph traversal;greedy algorithm;iterative method;pursuit-evasion;randomness;robotics;search algorithm	Athanasios Kehagias;Geoffrey A.

To estimate the hidden path of X up to time n,X<sub>0</sub>,X<sub>1</sub>,...,X<sub>n</sub>, by the observations Y <sub>0</sub>,Y<sub>1</sub>,...,Y<sub>n</sub>, usually the maximum a posteriori probability path estimator (MAP path estimator) is applied. An effective means for calculating this estimator is the Viterbi algorithm, which is widely employed in the fields of coding theory, correction of intersymbol interference and text recognition. Here, properties of the MAP estimator are derived. Under a certain Condition C, it is shown that the limiting process U=(U<sub>0</sub>,U<sub>1</sub>,...) is a regenerative process. Particularly, this means that U has an asymptotic distribution, satisfies the Central Limit Theorem, and possesses a mean error. Furthermore, Condition C is satisfied for a broad class of HMMs including the most important case for applications, the HMM with additive white Gaussian noise	additive white gaussian noise;coding theory;hidden markov model;interference (communication);markov chain;optical character recognition;utility functions on indivisible goods;viterbi algorithm	Amke Caliebe	2006	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2005.860425	additive white gaussian noise;speech recognition;pattern recognition;mathematics;hidden markov model;statistics	Metrics	53.24145350464815	11.979756411239233	28985

How accurately can one recover the “histogram” (i.e. cumulative density function) of the pi’s? While the empirical estimates would recover the histogram to earth mover distance Θ( 1 √ t ) (equivalently, `1 distance between the CDFs), we show that, provided n is sufficiently large, we can achieve error O( 1t ) which is information theoretically optimal. We also extend our results to the multi-dimensional parameter case, capturing settings where each member of the population has multiple associated parameters. Beyond the theoretical results, we demonstrate that the recovery algorithm performs well in practice on a variety of datasets, providing illuminating insights into several domains, including politics, sports analytics, and variation in the gender ratio of offspring.	algorithm;entity;population	Kevin Tian;Weihao Kong;Gregory Valiant	2017			machine learning;cumulative distribution function;earth mover's distance;artificial intelligence;histogram;random variable;mathematics;population	ML	46.3804914709557	15.177092701115976	29021

Significant work has been done on analogous problems for the light tailed case (when the tail distribution decreases at an exponential rate or faster) that involve importance sampling methods using appropriate exponential twisting. However, for the subexponential case, such exponential twisting is infeasible and alternative techniques are needed. In this paper we introduce importance sampling techniques where the new probability measure is obtained by twisting the hazard rate of the original distribution. For subexponential distributions this amounts to subexponential twisting---twisting at a subexponential rate.

In each step, a new edge is drawn uniformly at random from all non-edges and is presented to the player, henceforth called Painter. Painter must assign one of r available colors to each edge immediately, where r ≥ 2 is a fixed integer. The game is over as soon as a monochromatic copy of some fixed graph F has been created, and Painter’s goal is to ‘survive’ for as many steps as possible before this happens. We present a new technique for deriving upper bounds on the threshold of this game, i.e., on the typical number of steps Painter will survive with an optimal strategy. More specifically, we consider a deterministic two-player variant of the game where the edges are not chosen randomly, but by a second player Builder. However, Builder has to adhere to the restriction that, for some real number d, the ratio of edges to vertices in all subgraphs of the evolving board never exceeds d. We show that the existence of a winning strategy for Builder in this deterministic game implies an upper bound of n2−1/d for the threshold of the original probabilistic game. Moreover, we show that the best bound that can be derived in this way is indeed the threshold of the game if F is a forest. We illustrate our technique with several examples, and derive new explicit bounds for the case when F is a path.	color;deterministic algorithm;graph (discrete mathematics);monochrome;randomness;vertex (geometry)	Michael Belfrage;Torsten Mütze;Reto Spöhel	2012	SIAM J.

The main difficulty of this problem is the efficient separation of equivalence classes into elements in the discrete structure. One of such methods of classification is to encode the discrete object through the properties of an arithmetic graph. The theory of arithmetic graphs is taken as a basis for encoding. Encoded polyhedral arithmetic graphs with their equivalence classes are introduced in the given examples, for which an information amount is calculated by Shannons classical formula. The results of the research reveals the correlation/interrelation between materia, energy and information.

1e17a05a515d3cf18df92949d3489b0113b1b131	isoperimetric inequalities in simplicial complexes		In graph theory there are intimate connections between the expansion properties of a graph and the spectrum of its Laplacian. In this paper we define a notion of combinatorial expansion for simplicial complexes of general dimension, and prove that similar connections exist between the combinatorial expansion of a complex, and the spectrum of the high dimensional Laplacian defined by Eckmann. In particular, we present a Cheeger-type inequality, and a high-dimensional Expander Mixing Lemma. As a corollary, using the work of Pach, we obtain a connection between spectral properties of complexes and Gromov’s notion of geometric overlap. Using the work of Gundert and Wagner, we give an estimate for the combinatorial expansion and geometric overlap of random Linial–Meshulam complexes.	discrete laplace operator;expander mixing lemma;graph theory;isoperimetric inequality;simplicial complex;social inequality	Ori Parzanchevski;Ron Rosenthal;Ran J.

69ec20023ff3b8bdb42c76133911ec5919c264e4	on the graceful labelling of triangular cacti conjecture		A graceful labelling of a graph with n edges is a vertex labelling where the induced set of edge weights is {1, . . . , n}. A near graceful labelling is almost the same, the difference being that the edge weights are {1, 2, . . . , n − 1, n + 1}. In both cases, the weight of an edge is the absolute difference between its two vertex labels. Rosa [8] in 1988 conjectured that all triangular cacti are either graceful or near graceful. He also suggested the use of Skolem sequences to label some types of triangular cacti. In this paper, we verify the conjecture for two families of triangular cacti, and extend the discussion for further research. Particular constructions of Skolem sequences are discussed, as well as a technique using Langford sequences to obtain Skolem and hooked Skolem sequences with specific sub-sequences. These special sequences are used to gracefully label the two families which are the focus of the paper.	categorization;expanded memory;graceful exit;graceful labeling	Danny Dyer;Ian Payne;Nabil Shalaby;Brenda Wicks	2012	Australasian J.

Our motivation is Strassen’s astounding asymptotic rank conjecture that the asymptotic rank of any tight tensor is minimal. In particular, we determine the dimension of the set of tight tensors. Surprisingly we prove this dimension equals the dimension of the set of oblique tensors, a less restrictive class of tensors that Strassen identified as useful for his laser method.	asymptote;oblique projection;strassen algorithm	Austin Conner;Fulvio Gesmundo;J.

ea84995e21bf19d8deecc1c88d0b47be83ddb267	colouring random graphs	random graph;part of book or chapter of book	How many colours are typically necessary to colour a graph? We survey a number of perspectives on this natural question, which is central to random graph theory and to probabilistic and extremal combinatorics. It has stimulated a vibrant area of research, with a rich history extending back through more than half a century. Erdős and Rényi [36] asked a form of this question in a celebrated early paper on random graphs in 1960. Let Gn,m be a graph chosen uniformly at random from the set of graphs with vertex-set [n] = {1, 2, . . . , n} and m edges. In this probabilistic model, we cannot rule out the possibility that Gn,m is, for example, the disjoint union of one large clique and some isolated vertices, or perhaps one Turán graph (a balanced complete multipartite graph) and some isolated vertices. The resulting range is large: in the former situation the chromatic number could be about √ 2m, while in the latter it could be 2 if m ≤ n2/4. These outcomes are unlikely, however, and we are interested in the most probable ones. To state the question properly, we say that an event An (which here always describes a property of a random graph on the vertex-set [n]) holds asymptotically almost surely (a.a.s.) if the probability that An holds satisfies P(An)→ 1 as n→∞. Erdős and Rényi asked the following question. Suppose that m ∼ cn for some c ≥ 12 . Is there a positive integer function f = fc(n) for which χ(Gn,m) = f a.a.s., and if so how large is it?	carrier-to-noise ratio;color;erdős number;extremal combinatorics;graph (discrete mathematics);graph coloring;graph theory;random graph;statistical model;turán graph	Colin McDiarmid	1984	Annals OR	10.1007/BF01874388	random graph;combinatorics;mathematics;indifference graph;algorithm	Theory	28.598052768296743	24.386297361589133	29517

We present a complete answer for the existence of fundamental matrices for any value of m. We disprove the widely held beliefs that fundamental matrices always exist whenever $$m \le 7$$ m ≤ 7 . At the same time, we prove that they exist unconditionally when $$m \le 5$$ m ≤ 5 . Under a mild genericity condition, we show that an essential matrix always exists when $$m \le 4$$ m ≤ 4 . We also characterize the six and seven point configurations in two views for which all matrices satisfying the epipolar constraint have rank at most one.	epipolar geometry;essential matrix;fundamental matrix (computer vision);generic programming	Sameer Agarwal;Hon-leung Lee;Bernd Sturmfels;Rekha R.

b83d4a078fe084c98bde71dca2944d1e2cef8324	fast mcmc sampling algorithms on polytopes		We propose and analyze two new MCMC sampling algorithms, the Vaidya walk and the John walk, for generating samples from the uniform distribution over a polytope. Both random walks are sampling algorithms derived from interior point methods. The former is based on volumetric-logarithmic barrier introduced by Vaidya whereas the latter uses John’s ellipsoids. We show that the Vaidya walk mixes in significantly fewer steps than the logarithmic-barrier based Dikin walk studied in past work. For a polytope in R defined by n > d linear constraints, we show that the mixing time from a warm start is bounded as O ( nd ) , compared to the O (nd) mixing time bound for the Dikin walk. The cost of each step of the Vaidya walk is of the same order as the Dikin walk, and at most twice as large in terms of constant pre-factors. For the John walk, we prove an O ( d · log(n/d) ) bound on its mixing time and conjecture that an improved variant of it could achieve a mixing time of O ( d · poly-log(n/d) ) . Additionally, we propose variants of the Vaidya and John walks that mix in polynomial time from a deterministic starting point. The speed-up of the Vaidya walk over the Dikin walk are illustrated in numerical examples.	algorithm;booting;fast fourier transform;interior point method;markov chain monte carlo;numerical analysis;sampling (signal processing);time complexity	Yuansi Chen;Raaz Dwivedi;Martin J.

f2abb1502ac1ff43750b31313636ca02e0ac4904	on the ordering of certain large cardinals		It is well known that the first strongly inaccessible cardinal is strictly less than the first weakly compact cardinal which in turn is strictly less than the first Ramsey cardinal, etc. However, once one passes the first measurable cardinal the inequalities are no longer strict. Magidor [3] has shown that the first strongly compact cardinal may be equal to the first measurable cardinal or equal to the first super-compact cardinal (the first supercompact cardinal is strictly larger than the first measurable cardinal). In this note we will indicate how Magidoru0027s methods can be used to show that it is undecidable whether one cardinal (the first strongly compact) is greater than or less than another large cardinal (the first huge cardinal). We assume that the reader is familiar with the ultrapower construction of Scott, as presented in Drake [1] or Kanamori, Reinhardt and Solovay [2]. Definition. A cardinal κ is huge (or 1-huge) if there is an elementary embedding j of the universe V into a transitive class M such that M contains the ordinals, is closed under j (κ) sequences, j (κ) u003e κ and j ↾ R κ = id. Let κ denote the first huge cardinal, and let λ = j (κ). One can see from easy reflection arguments that κ and λ are inaccessible in V and, in fact, that κ is measurable in V .		Carl F.

We give a geometric proof of a result of Jim Propp: this poset is the disjoint union of distributive lattices. Let G be a connected graph on the vertex set [n] = {0} ∪ [n], where [n] denotes the set {1, . . . , n}. Let P denote the collection of acyclic orientations of G, and let P0 denote the collection of acyclic orientations of G with 0 as a sink. If Ω is an orientation in P with the vertex i as a source, we can obtain a new orientation Ω with i as a sink by firing the vertex i, reorienting all the edges adjacent to i towards i. The orientations Ω and Ω agree away from i. A firing sequence from Ω to Ω in P consists of a sequence Ω = Ω1, . . . ,Ωm+1 = Ω ′ of orientations and a function F : [m] −→ [n] such that for each i ∈ [m], the orientation Ωi+1 is obtained from Ωi by firing the vertex F (i). We will abuse language by calling F itself a firing sequence. We make P into a preorder by writing Ω ≤ Ω if and only if there is a firing sequence from Ω to Ω. From the definition it is clear that P is reflexive and transitive. While P is only a preorder, P0 is a poset. By finiteness, antisymmetry can be verified by showing that firing sequences in P0 cannot be arbitrarily long. This is a consequence of the fact that neighbors of the distinguished sink 0 cannot fire. The proof depends on the following lemma. Lemma 1. Let F : [m] −→ [n] be a firing sequence for the graph G. If i and j are adjacent vertices in G, then |F(i)| ≤ |F(j)| + 1. Proof. A vertex can fire only if it is a source. Firing the vertex i reverses the orientation of its edge to the vertex j. Hence the vertex i cannot fire again until the orientation is again reversed, which can only happen by firing j. As a corollary, firing sequences have bounded length, implying that P0 is a poset. Corollary 2. The preorder P0 of acyclic orientations with a distinguished sink is a poset. Proof. Let F : [m] −→ [n] be a firing sequence. By iterating the lemma, |F−1(i)| ≤ d(0, i) − 1, so	acyclic orientation;antisymmetry;connectivity (graph theory);neighbourhood (graph theory);orientation (graph theory);vertex (graph theory)	Richard Ehrenborg;Michael Slone	2009	Order	10.1007/s11083-009-9122-z	distributive lattice;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;connectivity;mathematics;tree	Theory	33.63512428877883	28.251921734585185	29754

For a vertex v of G, the neighborhood color set NC(v) is the set of colors of the neighbors of v. The coloring c is called a set coloring if NC(u) 6= NC(v) for every pair u, v of adjacent vertices of G. The minimum number of colors required of such a coloring is called the set chromatic number χs(G) of G. The set chromatic numbers of some well-known classes of graphs are determined and several bounds are established for the set chromatic number of a graph in terms of other graphical parameters.	color;connectivity (graph theory);graph (discrete mathematics);graph coloring;graphical user interface;neighbourhood (graph theory);vertex (graph theory)	Gary Chartrand;Futaba Fujie-Okamoto;Craig W.

We further prove a corresponding theorem for the number of nodes of degree two in labelled planar graphs. The proof method is based on generating functions and singularity analysis. In particular we need systems of equations for multivariate generating functions and transfer results for singular representations of analytic functions. 1. Statement of main results A graph is series-parallel if it does not contain the complete graph K4 as a minor; equivalently, if it does not contain a subdivision of K4. Since both K5 and K3,3 contain a subdivision of K4, by Kuratowski’s theorem a series-parallel graph is planar. An outerplanar graph is a planar graph that can be embedded in the plane so that all vertices are incident to the outer face. They are characterized as those graphs not containing a minor isomorphic to (or a subdivision of) either K4 orK2,3. These are important subfamilies of planar graphs, as they are much simpler but often they already capture the essential structural properties of planar graphs. In particular, they are used as a natural first benchmark for many algorithmic problems and conjectures related to planar graphs The purpose of this paper is to study the number of vertices of given degree in certain classes of labelled planar graphs. In particular, we study labelled outerplanar graphs and series-parallel graphs; in what follows, all graphs are labelled. In order to state our results we introduce the notion of the degree distribution of a random outerplanar graph (the definition for series-parallel graphs is exactly the same). For every n we consider the class of all vertex labelled outerplanar graphs with n vertices. Let Dn denote the degree of a randomly chosen vertex in this class of graphs. Then we say that this class of graphs has a degree distribution if there exist non-negative numbers dk with ∑ k≥0 dk = 1 such that for all k lim n→∞ Pr{Dn = k} = dk . In a companion paper [6], we have established that the classes of 2-connected, connected or all outerplanar graphs, as well as the corresponding classes of seriesparallel graphs have a degree distribution. We describe briefly the degree distribution in the outerplanar case, which is the simplest one, and refer to [6] for the other 1Alternatively we can define Dn as the degree of the vertex with label 1. 1 2 MICHAEL DRMOTA, OMER GIMENEZ, AND MARC NOY cases.

The function D(x) is a minor modification of function A(x) in (2.1), and g(x,w) is the generating function of rooted of 2-connected outerplanar graphs, where w marks the degree of the root.

06af0d880d4f484d7c13cbaa71bb77f98f1054f4	the cd-index of bruhat intervals	coxeter group;bruhat order;boolean algebra;upper bound;indexation	We study flag enumeration in intervals in the Bruhat order on a Coxeter group by means of a structural recursion on intervals in the Bruhat order. The recursion gives the isomorphism type of a Bruhat interval in terms of smaller intervals, using basic geometric operations which preserve PL sphericity and have a simple effect on the cd-index. This leads to a new proof that Bruhat intervals are PL spheres as well a recursive formula for the cd-index of a Bruhat interval. This recursive formula is used to prove that the cd-indices of Bruhat intervals span the space of cd-polynomials. The structural recursion leads to a conjecture that Bruhat spheres are “smaller” than polytopes. More precisely, we conjecture that if one fixes the lengths of x and y, then the cd-index of a certain dual stacked polytope is a coefficientwise upper bound on the cd-indices of Bruhat intervals [x, y]. We show that this upper bound would be tight by constructing Bruhat intervals which are the face lattices of these dual stacked polytopes. As a weakening of a special case of the conjecture, we show that the flag h-vectors of lower Bruhat intervals are bounded above by the flag h-vectors of Boolean algebras (i. e. simplices). A graded poset is Eulerian if in every non-trivial interval, the number of elements of odd rank equals the number of elements of even rank. Face lattices of convex polytopes are in particular Eulerian and the study of flag enumeration in Eulerian posets has its origins in the face-enumeration problem for polytopes. All flag-enumerative information in an Eulerian poset P can be encapsulated in a non-commutative generating function ΦP called the cd-index. The cd-indices of polytopes have received much attention, for example in [1, 2, 8, 11, 18]. ∗The author was partially supported by the Thomas H. Shevlin Fellowship from the University of Minnesota Graduate School and by NSF grant DMS-9877047. This article consists largely of material from the author’s doctoral thesis [14]. the electronic journal of combinatorics 11 (2004), #R74 1 A Coxeter group is a group generated by involutions, subject to certain relations. Important examples include finite reflection groups and Weyl groups. The Bruhat order on a Coxeter group is a partial order which has important connections to the combinatorics and representation theory of Coxeter groups, and by extension Lie algebras and groups. Intervals in Bruhat order comprise another important class of Eulerian posets. However, flag enumeration for intervals in the Bruhat order on a Coxeter group has previously received little attention. The goal of the present work is to initiate the study of the cd-index of Bruhat intervals. The basic tool in our study is a fundamental structural recursion (Theorem 5.5) on intervals in the Bruhat order on Coxeter groups. This recursion, although developed independently, has some resemblance to work by du Cloux [6] and by Dyer [7]. The recursion gives the isomorphism type of a Bruhat interval in terms of smaller intervals, using some basic geometric operations, namely the operations of pyramid, vertex shaving and a “zipping” operation. The result is a new inductive proof of the fact [3] that Bruhat intervals are PL spheres (Corollary 5.6) as well as recursions for the cd-index of Bruhat intervals (Theorem 6.1). The recursive formulas lead to a proof that the cd-indices of Bruhat intervals span the space of cd-polynomials (Theorem 6.2), and motivate a conjecture on the upper bound for the cd-indices of Bruhat intervals (Conjecture 7.3). Let [u, v] be an interval in the Bruhat order such that the rank of u is k and the rank of v is d + k + 1. We conjecture that the coefficients of Φ[u,v] are bounded above by the coefficients of the cd-index of a dual stacked polytope of dimension d with d + k + 1 facets. The dual stacked polytopes are the polar duals of the stacked polytopes of [12]. This upper bound would be sharp because the structural recursion can be used to construct Bruhat intervals which are the face lattices of duals of stacked polytopes (Proposition 7.2). Stanley [18] conjectured the non-negativity of the cd-indices of a much more general class of Eulerian posets. We show (Theorem 7.4) that if the conjectured non-negativity holds for Bruhat intervals, then the cd-index of any lower Bruhat interval is bounded above by the cd-index of a Boolean algebra. Since the flag h-vectors of Bruhat intervals are non-negative, we are able to prove that the flag h-vectors of lower Bruhat intervals are bounded above by the flag h-vectors of Boolean algebras (Theorem 7.5). The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: We begin with background information on the basic objects appearing in this paper, namely, posets, Coxeter groups, Bruhat order and polytopes in Section 1, CW complexes and PL topology in Section 2 and the cd-index in Section 3. In Section 4, the zipping operation is introduced, and its basic properties are proven. Section 5 contains the proof of the structural recursion. In Section 6 we state and prove the cd-index recursions and apply them to determine the affine span of cd-indices of Bruhat intervals. Section 7 is a discussion of conjectured bounds on the coefficients of the cd-index of a Bruhat interval, including the construction of Bruhat intervals which are isomorphic to the face lattices of dual stacked polytopes. the electronic journal of combinatorics 11 (2004), #R74 2	boolean algebra;coefficient;eulerian path;fuchsian group;hallin's spheres;ibm notes;lagrangian and eulerian specification of the flow field;lagrangian–eulerian advection;mathematical induction;negativity (quantum mechanics);polynomial;recursion;sql;simplicial complex;structural induction;surround sound;the stanley parable	Nathan Reading	2004	Electr.

The cluster editing problem is closely related to correlation clustering and has applications, e.g. in image segmentation. For general graphs this problem is ({mathbb {APX}})-hard. In this paper we present an efficient polynomial time approximation scheme for the cluster editing problem on graphs embeddable in the plane with a few edge crossings. The running time of the algorithm is ({2^{Oleft( epsilon ^{-1} log (epsilon ^{-1})right) }n}) for planar graphs and (2^{Oleft( k^2epsilon ^{-1}log left( k^2epsilon ^{-1}right) right) }n) for planar graphs with at most k crossings.	ptas reduction	André Berger;Alexander Grigoriev;Andrej Winokurow	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-51741-4_3	correlation clustering;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;computer science;mathematics	Robotics	25.588931936534248	26.946374118532095	30176

However, Dexter has also made several important contributions to the theory of information invariants, and produced some of the most profound results in this field. These are first embodied in his 1978 paper On the Power of the Compass, with Manuel Blum. This work has had a wide impact in robotics and nanoscience. Starting with Dexter’s insights, robotics researchers have explored the problem of determining the information requirements to perform robot tasks, using the concept of information invariants. This represents an attempt to characterize a family of complicated and subtle issues concerned with measuring robot task complexity. In this vein, several measures have been proposed [14] to measure the information complexity of a task: (a) How much internal state should the robot retain? (b) How many cooperating robots are required, and how much communication between them is necessary? (c) How can the robot change (side-effect) the environment in order to record state or sensory information to perform a task? (d) How much information is provided by sensors? and (e) How much computation is required by the robot? We have considered how one might develop a kind of “calculus” on (a) – (e) in order to compare the power of sensor systems analytically.

A linear partition of a graph G is a partition of its edge set into linear forests and la(G) is the minimum number of linear forests in a linear partition. It is well known that la(G) = 2 when G is a cubic graph and Wormald [17] conjectured that if |V (G)| ≡ 0 (mod 4), then it is always possible to find a linear partition in two isomorphic linear forests. We give here some new results concerning this conjecture.	arboricity;connected component (graph theory);cubic function;graph partition;nick wormald	Jean-Luc Fouquet;Henri Thuillier;Jean-Marie Vanherpe;A.

Given a spectrum for a desired fusion frame operator and dimensions for subspaces, one existing method for creating unitweight fusion frames with these properties is the flexible and elementary procedure known as spectral tetris. Despite the extensive literature on fusion frames, until now there has been no construction of fusion frames with prescribed weights. In this paper we use spectral tetris to construct more general, arbitrarily weighted fusion frames. Moreover, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for when a desired fusion frame can be constructed via spectral tetris.	hilbert space;image fusion;tetris	Peter G.

The notes are based on a lecture course given at Oxford over the past few years. They contain numerous exercises, and hopefully will prove useful for self-study by those seeking a first introduction to the subject, with fairly minimal prerequisites. The coverage is by no means comprehensive, but should provide a good basis for further study; a guide to further reading is included. The main prerequisite is a basic familiarity with the elements of discrete mathematics: sets, relations and functions. An Appendix contains a summary of what we will need, and it may be useful to review this first. In addition, some prior exposure to abstract algebra — vector spaces and linear maps, or groups and group homomorphisms — would be helpful.	categorical logic;category theory;code coverage;discrete mathematics;map	Samson Abramsky;Nikos Tzevelekos	2008	CoRR	10.1007/978-3-642-12821-9_1	topology;vector space;mathematics;algorithm;category theory;algebra	Logic	42.95957028148891	28.490874593377715	30523

We bound ‖MΣ̃n − I‖∞ by constructing a martingale difference sequence (see Definition G.1 in Appendix G) and applying a Bernstein-type inequality (Lemma F.8) to this sequence. We then bound ‖θ∗ − θ̂‖1 via a standard argument for Lasso-type estimators that relies on the restricted eigenvalue condition. We amend this argument to work in our non-i.i.d. setting by appealing to martingale theory and present a restricted eigenvalue condition for martingale difference sequences in Appendix F.	causal filter;causal inference;lasso;phil bernstein;social inequality	Aditya Chaudhry;Pan Xu;Quanquan Gu	2017			false discovery rate;causal inference;pattern recognition;artificial intelligence;machine learning;computer science	ML	42.63513845396518	16.167757561844056	30546
098e5a63d4eb76b00efa41377e410d2640d66d4e	random trees and general branching processes	branching processes;preferential attachment;random trees	We consider a tree that grows randomly in time. Each time a new vertex appears, it chooses exactly one of the existing vertices and attaches to it. The probability that the new vertex chooses vertex x is proportional to w(deg(x)), a weight function of the actual degree of x. The weight function w : N → R+ is the parameter of the model. In [4] and [11] the authors derive the asymptotic degree distribution for a model that is equivalent to the special case, when the weight function is linear. The proof therein strongly relies on the linear choice of w. Using well established results from the theory of general branching processes we give the asymptotical degree distribution for a wide range of weight functions. Moreover, we provide the asymptotic distribution of the tree itself as seen from a randomly selected vertex. The latter approach gives greater insight to the limiting structure of the tree. Our proof is robust and we believe that the method may be used to answer several other questions related to the model. It relies on the fact that considering the evolution of the random tree in continuous time, the process may be viewed as a general branching process, this way classical results can be applied.	asymptote;degree distribution;r language;random tree;randomness;robustness (computer science);weight function	Anna Rudas;Bálint Tóth;Benedek Valkó	2007	Random Struct.

We introduce enhancements to an Evolutionary Algorithm optimization process to infer the parameters of the non-linear system given by the observed data more reliably and precisely.

Further on, the problem often is multi-modal and therefore appropriate optimization strategies become necessary. Therefore, we propose a new method, which will suggest necessary additional biological experiments to remove the ambiguities.	dna microarray;evolutionary algorithm;experiment;gene regulatory network;knockout;linear system;mathematical optimization;modal logic;nonlinear system	Christian Spieth;Felix Streichert;Nora Speer;Andreas Zell	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-24653-4_11	gene expression;dna microarray;computer science;bioinformatics;artificial intelligence;evolutionary algorithm;algorithm	AI	30.369945207538358	5.541741296226382	30744

The procedure consists of using atomic codes based on enumeration of paths of different length within the molecular skeleton and their subsequent summation for the atoms forming the rings. The proposed characterization provides an illustration of the advantages of treating path sequences rather formally as mathematical entities, to which standard mathematical operations are applicable. Illustrations give a variety of ring codes (sequences) and show how these can be used to recognize equivalent rings in complex polycyclic structures. The procedure can be extended to other kinds of fragments. One such application is illustrated with polyadamantanes. The proposed ring codes need not necessarily be used in the form presented here.

We determine the best available upper bound for the constant C. This bound follows from Arnold inequalities on the number of empty ovals. To evaluate its rate we show its equivalence with the rate of growth of the number of trees half of whose vertices are leaves and evaluate the latter rate. Introduction. Recall that a rooted tree is a tree with a distinguished vertex. The distinguished vertex is called the root. The multiplicity or the valence of a vertex is the number of edges which are incident to it. A vertex of multiplicity one is called a leaf. By convention, we assume that the root is a leaf if the tree has no other vertices. Otherwise, the root is not considered as a leaf even if its multiplicity is one. In this paper we work exclusively with unlabelled finite trees. Rooted unlabelled trees are used to encode the topology of nonsingular curves in the real projective plane (by a nonsingular curve we mean a closed one-dimensional, not necessarily connected, sub-manifold). We associate the vertices with the connected components of the complement of the curve. The root will correspond to the component with non-oriented closure and the tree will represent the adjacency relations between the components (see Figure 1). The fact that this graph is a tree follows from the Jordan curve theorem. It is finite since our curves are compact. It is worth noticing that two curves have the same encoding if and only if there is an ambient isotopy transforming one into another.	arnold;box counting;connected component (graph theory);degree (graph theory);encode;linear algebra;tree (data structure);turing completeness;vertex (geometry);vertex (graph theory)	V.

We apply the following result of Amar (1991) to balanced bipartite graphs satisfying the degree conditions of Moon and Moser (1963) and of Chvatal (1972): If there exist two vertices x1 and x2, the distance between which is two, on a hamiltonian cycle of a bipartite graph G of order 2n, such that d(x,)+d(x,)>n+l, then G is bipancyclic, except in some special cases Thus, we show that these conditions sufficient to ensure the existence of a hamiltonian cycle also imply bipancyclism, and obtain a new proof (and easier) of a theorem of Mitchem and Schmeichel (1982). Then we give a new condition for a connected balanced bipartite graph of order 2n to be hamiltonian: dist(x, y)=3 3 d(x)+d(y)>n+l, and, applying again the theorem above, we prove that this condition is sufficient for the graph to be bipancyclic.	discrete mathematics;existential quantification;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);hamiltonian path;moser spindle	Denise Amar	1993	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/0012-365X(93)90136-H	hamiltonian path;graph power;edge-transitive graph;complete bipartite graph;factor-critical graph;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;bipartite graph;simplex graph;pancyclic graph;foster graph;mathematics;voltage graph;hamiltonian path problem;biregular graph;quartic graph;line graph	Theory	29.153614929429448	32.01391439368058	30937

This task is challenging due to the accumulation of a number of difficulties like the complexity of the underlying physics and the constraints in the admissible sensor locations and their number. As a result, the placement, still today, strongly relies on the know-how and experience of engineers from different areas of expertise. The present methodology contributes to making this process become more systematic and, in turn, simplify and accelerate the procedure.	interpolation	Jean-Philippe Argaud;Bertrand Bouriquet;Francesco Caso;Helin Gong;Yvon Maday;Olga Mula	2018	J.

A graph is called t-tough, if the removal of any cutset S leaves at most |S|/t components. The toughness of a graph is the largest t for which the graph is t-tough. A graph is minimally t-tough, if the toughness of the graph is t and the deletion of any edge from the graph decreases the toughness. The complexity class DP is the set of all languages that can be expressed as the intersection of a language in NP and a language in coNP. We prove that recognizing minimally t-tough graphs is DP-complete for any positive integer t and for any positive rational number t ≤ 1/2.	co-np;complexity class;cut (graph theory);graph toughness;np (complexity)	Gyula Y.

The problem can be described as follows. There are given m parallel machines and a graph G, whose vertices represent jobs. Simultaneity constraint means that we can process a vertex job v if and only if there exists at least dG(v) idle machines, where dG(v) is the degree of vertex v in graph G. Once a vertex job is completed, we delete the vertex and its incident edges from the graph. The number of machines that a vertex job needing depends on its degree in current graph. Changes of graph result in changes of vertex degree. Here, we consider a special case that all jobs in the original graph are unit-length. Let pv denote the processing time of vertex job v, we define pv = 0 if d(v) = 0, and pv = 1, otherwise. The objective is to minimize the time by which each vertex job is completed, i.e., the time by which the graph becomes an empty graph. We show that this problem is strongly NP-hard and provide a $(2-\frac{1}{m})$-approximation algorithm.	makespan;parallel computing;scheduling (computing)	Lin Lin;Yixun Lin;Xianwei Zhou;Ruyan Fu	2010	APJOR	10.1142/S0217595910002934	loop;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;independent set;graph bandwidth;feedback vertex set;degree;edge space;computer science;regular graph;constraint graph;edge cover;cycle graph;vertex;mathematics;distributed computing;biconnected graph;windmill graph;reachability;complement graph;approximation algorithm;string graph;circulant graph	AI	24.965010515368963	24.229683980345314	31087

We derive recurrences for L(m,n), the number of legal positions on an m×n board, and develop a dynamic programming algorithm which computes L(m,n) in time O(mnλ) and space O(mλ), for some constant λ < 5.4. We used this to compute L(n, n) up to the standard board size n = 19. In ternary (mapping 0,1,2 to empty,black,white) L(19, 19) = | | For even larger boards, we prove existence of a base of liberties L = lim m,n→∞ mn √ L(m,n) = 2.975734192043357249381 . . . Based on a conjecture about vanishing error-terms, we derive an asymptotic formula for L(m,n), which is shown to be highly accurate. We also study the Game Tree complexity of Go, proving an upper bound on the number of possible games of (mn) and a lower bound of 2 n2/2−O(n) on n × n and 2 n−1 on 1 × n boards, in addition to exact counts formn ≤ 4 and estimates up tomn = 9.

There is a path containing n vertices. Every vertex i has an initial load hi, and every edge (j, j + 1) has an initial load wj that it needs to distribute among the two vertices that are its endpoints. The goal is to distribute the load of the edges over the vertices in a way that will make the loads of the vertices as balanced as possible (formally, minimizing the sum of squares of loads of the vertices). This problem can be solved in polynomial time, e.g, by dynamic programming. We present an algorithm that solves this problem in time O(n log n). As a mental aide in the design of our algorithm, we first design a hydraulic apparatus composed of bins (representing vertices), tubes (representing edges) that are connected between bins, cylinders within the tubes that constrain the flow of water, and valves that can close the connections between bins and tubes. Water may be poured into the various bins, to levels that correspond to the initial loads in the input to the PB problem. When all valves are opened, the water flows between bins (to the extent that is feasible due to the cylinders) and stabilizes at levels that are the correct output to the respective PB problem. Our algorithm is based on a fast simulation of the behavior of this hydraulic apparatus, when valves are opened one by one.	algorithm;dijkstra's algorithm;dynamic programming;load balancing (computing);matching (graph theory);petabyte;scheduling (computing);simulation;time complexity;tree (data structure);vertex (geometry);vertex (graph theory)	Nikhil R.

Most of decision processes have Markov property and can be modeled as MDP. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an approach to deal with MDPs. RL methods are based on Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithms, such as Policy Evaluation, Policy Iteration and Value Iteration. In this paper, policy evaluation algorithm is represented in the form of a discrete-time dynamical system. Hence, using Discrete-Time Control methods, behavior of agent and properties of various policies, can be analyzed. The general case of grid-world problems is addressed, and some important results are obtained for this type of problems as a theorem. For example, equivalent system of an optimal policy for a grid-world problem is dead-beat.		S.

A placement of B, any congruent copy of B (without reflection), is called free if B does not intersect the interior of any polygon in O at this placement. A placement z of B is called critical if B forms three “distinct” contacts with O at z. Let φ(B,O) be the number of free critical placements. A set of placements of B is called a stabbing set of O if each polygon in O intersects at least one placement of B in this set. We develop efficient Monte Carlo algorithms that compute a stabbing set of size h = O(h∗ log m), with high probability, where h∗ is the size of the optimal stabbing set of O. We also improve bounds on φ(B, O) for the following three cases, namely, (i) B is a line segment and the obstacles in O are pairwise-disjoint, (ii) B is a line segment and the obstacles in O may intersect (iii) B is a convex k-gon and the obstacles in O are disjoint, and use these improved bounds to analyze the running time of our stabbing-set algorithm.	gon;monte carlo algorithm;time complexity;with high probability	Pankaj K.

To obtain rational solutions, we use augmented bins of height $$1+\gamma $$ 1 + γ , for some arbitrarily small number $$\gamma > 0$$ γ > 0 . For this problem, we obtain an asymptotic approximation scheme (APTAS) that is polynomial on $$\log 1/\gamma $$ log 1 / γ , and thus $$\gamma $$ γ may be given as part of the problem input. For the special case that $$\gamma $$ γ is constant, we give a (one dimensional) resource augmentation scheme, that is, we obtain a packing into bins of unit width and height $$1+\gamma $$ 1 + γ using no more than the number of bins in an optimal packing without resource augmentation. Additionally, we obtain an APTAS for the circle strip packing problem, whose goal is to pack a set of circles into a strip of unit width and minimum height. Our algorithms are the first approximation schemes for circle packing problems, and are based on novel ideas of iteratively separating small and large items, and may be extended to a wide range of packing problems that satisfy certain conditions. These extensions comprise problems with different kinds of items, such as regular polygons, or with bins of different shapes, such as circles and spheres. As an example, we obtain APTAS’s for the problems of packing d-dimensional spheres into hypercubes under the $$L_p$$ L p -norm.	algorithm;order of approximation;polygon (computer graphics);polynomial;set packing;the circle (file system);time complexity	Flávio Keidi Miyazawa;Lehilton L.

Optimal network planning imposes numerous iterative computations and evaluations of network coverage until the optimal antenna layout is achieved. Typically, iterations within optimization algorithms invoke neighboring search functions where one of the antennas of a given antenna layout solution changes its position while the rest of the antennas' locations are maintained fixed. Such process is repeated successively with the corresponding coverage being evaluated until the optimal antenna layout is declared. Accordingly, the underlying ray tracing algorithm for coverage computations is called repeatedly during the optimization process leading to significantly long optimization convergence times. In this paper, an enhancement to our recently proposed ray tracing algorithm is proposed where computations based on image theory during the optimization routine may be derived from previous achieved solutions rather than overtaking the whole computation process.

e4ce04bcbb90c13b60a85db4c99fd0b650a1f9d6	a computer-based approach to describe the 13c nmr chemical shifts of alkanes by the generalized spectral moments of iterated line graphs	quantitative structure property relationship;embedding frequencies;chemical shift;qspr;alkanes;model development;chemical shifts;line graph;spectral moments	A recently introduced strategy to quantitative structure-property relationship studies is used to model the sum of 13C NMR chemical shifts of alkanes. This graph theoretical approach is based on the spectral moments of the iterated line graph sequence (ILGS). The statistical quality of the model developed by using the present approach is compared to those obtained by using spectral moments of the bond matrix or the embedding frequencies of alkanes as independent variables. The embedding frequencies were computed on the basis of the spectral moments of the ILGS. The emphasis of this work is on the structural interpretation of the results. Consequently, the contributions of the different structural fragments of alkanes to the 13C NMR chemical shift sum are computed by the three theoretical approaches. The advantages and disadvantages of the use of these approaches are analyzed on the basis of computational expenditure, i.e. computer time and memory, and the statistical quality, complexity, and structural interpretation of the models developed.

Our algorithms are designed to effectively reuse last-cycle solutions to speed up the initial approximation performance on the next cycle. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithms outperform existing algorithms when a large number of similar bids are contained through iterations. Also, we propose an enhanced algorithm that effectively avoids the undesirable reuse of the last solutions in the algorithm without serious computational overheads.	approximation algorithm;iteration	Naoki Fukuta;Takayuki Ito	2009			auction algorithm;mathematical optimization;combinatorial auction;computer science	AI	28.042279592525357	8.472741041816862	31856

It is well known that the relative sensor-target geometry can significantly affect the performance of any particular localization algorithm. The localization performance can be explicitly characterized by certainmeasures, for example, by the Cramer–Rao lower bound (which is equal to the inverse Fisher information matrix) on the estimator variance. In addition, the Cramer–Rao lower bound is commonly used to generate a so-called uncertainty ellipse which characterizes the spatial variance distribution of an efficient estimate, i.e. an estimate which achieves the lower bound. The aim of this work is to identify those relative sensor-target geometries which result in ameasure of the uncertainty ellipse being minimized. Deeming such sensor-target geometries to be optimalwith respect to the chosenmeasure, the optimal sensor-target geometries for range-only, time-of-arrival-based and bearing-only localization are identified and studied in this work. The optimal geometries for an arbitrary number of sensors are identified and it is shown that an optimal sensor-target configuration is not, in general, unique. The importance of understanding the influence of the sensor-target geometry on the potential localization performance is highlighted via formal analytical results and a number of illustrative examples. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We study the basic question of whether there exists an analogue of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma for the /spl lscr//sub 1/ norm? Note that Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma gives a linear embedding which is independent of the point set. For the /spl lscr//sub 1/ norm, we show that one cannot hope to use linear embeddings as a dimensionality reduction tool for general point sets, even if the linear embedding is chosen as a function of the given point set. In particular, we construct a set of O(n) points in /spl lscr//sub 1//sup n/ such that any linear embedding into /spl lscr//sub 1//sup d/ must incur a distortion of /spl Omega//spl radic/(n/d). This bound is tight up to a log n factor. We then initiate a systematic study of general classes of /spl lscr//sub 1/ embeddable metrics that admit low dimensional, small distortion embeddings. In particular, we show dimensionality reduction theorems for tree metrics, circular-decomposable metrics, and metrics supported on K/sub 2,3/-free graphs, giving embeddings into /spl lscr//sub 1//sup O(log(2) n)/ with constant distortion. Finally, we also present lower bounds on dimension reduction techniques for other /spl lscr//sub p/ norms. Our work suggests that the notion of a stretch-limited embedding, where no distance is stretched by more than a factor d in any dimension, is important to the study of dimension reduction for /spl lscr//sub 1/. We use such stretch limited embeddings as a tool for proving lower bounds for dimension reduction and also as an algorithmic tool for proving positive results.	dimensionality reduction;t-norm;taxicab geometry	Moses Charikar;Amit Sahai	2002		10.1109/SFCS.2002.1181979	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;algorithm;algebra	Theory	27.611329078674178	21.719945055717204	31961

In this paper, we consider the case where both the signal and the measurements are complex-valued. We study the popular recovery method of l1-regularized least squares or LASSO. While several studies have shown that LASSO provides desirable solutions under certain conditions, the precise asymptotic performance of this algorithm in the complex setting is not yet known. In this paper, we extend the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm to solve the complex-valued LASSO problem and obtain the complex approximate message passing algorithm (CAMP). We then generalize the state evolution framework recently introduced for the analysis of AMP to the complex setting. Using the state evolution, we derive accurate formulas for the phase transition and noise sensitivity of both LASSO and CAMP. Our theoretical results are concerned with the case of i.i.d. Gaussian sensing matrices. Simulations confirm that our results hold for a larger class of random matrices.	approximation algorithm;compressed sensing;computer simulation;data recovery;gaussian blur;lasso;least squares;message passing;sparse matrix	Arian Maleki;Laura Anitori;Zai Yang;Richard G.

This value provides a quantitative measure for comparing different sets of points generated by solution procedures for difficult multiple objective optimization problems. We introduced the IPF for bi-criteria optimization problems in [Carlyle, W.M., Fowler, J.W., Gel, E., Kim, B., 2003. Quantitative comparison of approximate solution sets for bi-criteria optimization problems. Decision Sciences 34 (1), 63-82]. As indicated in that paper, the computational effort to obtain IPF is negligible for bi-criteria problems. For three or more objective function cases, however, the exact calculation of IPF is computationally demanding, since this requires k (≥ 3) dimensional integration. In this paper, we suggest a theoretical framework for obtaining IPF for k (≥ 3) objectives. The exact method includes solving two main sub-problems: (1) finding the optimality region of weights for all potentially optimal points, and (2) computing volumes of k dimensional convex polytopes. Several different algorithms for both sub-problems can be found in the literature. We use existing methods from computational geometry (i.e., triangulation and convex hull algorithms) to develop a reasonable exact method for obtaining IPF. We have also experimented with a Monte Carlo approximation method and compared the results to those with the exact IPF method.		Bosun Kim;Esma Senturk Gel;John W. Fowler;W.

Motivated by a generalization of the St. Petersburg game which was investigated by Gut (2010), we generalize the Feller game by introducing the parameter α. We investigate limit distributions of the generalized Feller game corresponding to the results of Gut. Firstly, we give the weak law of large numbers for α = 1. Moreover, for 0 < α ≤ 1, we have convergence in distribution to a stable law with index α. Finally, some limit theorems for a polynomial size and a geometric size deviation are given.	polynomial	Keisuke Matsumoto;Toshio Nakata	2013	J.

If A is a finite group, Q,(A) is the rank-r Dowling group geometry over A, and M is a rank-r matroid embeddable as a minor of Q,(A), then it is shown that the critical exponent of M over A is well defined and is determined by an evaluation of the characteristic polynomial of M. Classes of tangential k-blocks obtained from Dowling group geometries are also displayed. A consequence of the theory is that for the first time all cases of Hadwiger’s conjecture can be stated as critical problems.	characteristic polynomial;matroid	Geoff Whittle	1989	J. Comb.

Inspired by how biologists use gene knockouts for experimentally identifying genetic interaction networks in cellular organisms, we propose a node-knockout procedure for the complete characterization of the interaction geometry in consensus-type networks. In our context, the node knockout is essentially a grounding procedure- where the node broadcasts a zero state to its neighbors without being removed from the network. The proposed centralized identification process is also facilitated by introducing “ports” for stimulating a subset of network vertices via an appropriately defined interface and observing the network's response at another set of vertices. We then provide an example for the utility of such a network identification process in the context of fault detection for networked systems.	centralized computing;directed graph;distributed algorithm;experiment;fault detection and isolation;flocking (behavior);gene expression programming;identification scheme;knockout;network topology;norm (social);ramification problem;relevance;vertex (geometry)	Marzieh Nabi-Abdolyousefi;Mehran Mesbahi	2012	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2012.2200376		Vision	42.85656112380602	6.821961602723846	32331

It introduces a new approximation algorithm for the stable marriage problem. The algorithm improves on its predecessors on all accounts: simplicity, quality of approximation, and efficiency. The contribution “Deterministic Sampling Algorithms for Network Design” by Anke van Zuylen received the best student paper award in the design and analysis track. For several NP-hard network design problems, the best known approximation algorithms follow a simple randomized strategy, called sample-and-augment. A random sample from the input is drawn, a certain problem is solved, and the solution is extended to a full solution. Anke shows how to derandomize these algorithms by exhibiting a specific sample that works well. Hervé Fournier and Antoine Vigneron address a basic approximation problem: “Fitting a Step Function to a Point Set”. Given an integer k and a set P of points in the plane, the goal is to find the step function that minimizes the maximal vertical distance between the point set and the step function. The authors present an algorithm that runs in time O(n) for a point set sorted by x-coordinate.	alain fournier;algorithmica;approximation algorithm;curve fitting;esa;maximal set;mercury;np-hardness;network planning and design;randomized algorithm;stable marriage problem	Dan Halperin;Kurt Mehlhorn	2010	Algorithmica	10.1007/s00453-010-9409-x		Theory	25.07050203885422	17.853289125488065	32452

An improved performance guarantee has been derived. We can obtain a less restricted sufficient condition for signal reconstruction and a tighter recovery error bound under some conditions via weighted l1 minimization. When prior support estimate is at least 50% accurate, the sufficient condition is weaker than the analogous condition by standard l1 minimization method, meanwhile the reconstruction error upper bound is provably to be smaller under additional conditions. Furthermore, the sufficient condition is also proved sharp.	new general catalogue;signal reconstruction	Wengu Chen;Yaling Li	2016	CoRR		mathematical optimization;pattern recognition;mathematics;statistics	Metrics	48.53216931255333	9.175865613266472	32546

The role of the known signal is played by the casual least-squares estimate of the signal from the observations. However, the """"correlation"""" integral has to be interpreted in a special sense as an Ito stochastic integral. It will be shown that the formula includes all known explicit formulas for signals in white Gaussian noise. However, and more important, the formula suggests an """"estimator-correlator"""" philosophy for engineering approximation of the optimum receiver. Some extensions of the above result are also discussed, e.g., additive finite-variance, not necessarily Gaussian, noise plus a white Gaussian noise component. Purely colored Gaussian noise can be treated if whitening filters can be specified. The analog implementation of Ito integrals is briefly discussed. The proofs of the formulas are based on the concept of an innovation process, which has been useful in certain related problems of linear and nonlinear least-squares estimation, and on the concept of covariance factorization."""

Lovász and Winkler [8] point out that stopping rules which “look where they are going” (rather than simply walking a fixed number of steps) can achieve a desired distribution exactly and efficiently. Considering an optimal stopping rule that reflects some aspect of mixing, we can use the expected length of this rule as a mixing measure. On trees, a number of these mixing measures identify particular nodes with central properties. In this context, we study a variety of natural notions of centrality. Each of these criteria identifies the barycenter of the tree as the “average” center and the newly defined focus as the “extremal” center.	centrality;optimal stopping	Andrew Beveridge	2009	SIAM J.

ebd93149c48b79ae71c70965a8d9872d597a85ca	limiting measures for addition modulo a prime number cellular automata		Linear cellular automata have many invariant measures in general. There are several studies on their rigidity: The unique invariant measure with a suitable non-degeneracy condition (such as positive entropy or mixing property for the shift map) is the uniform measure — the most natural one. This is related to study of the asymptotic randomization property: Iterates starting from a large class of initial measures converge to the uniform measure (in Cesàro sense). In this paper we consider one-dimensional linear cellular automata with neighborhood of size two, and study limiting distributions starting from a class of shift-invariant probability measures. In the two-state case, we characterize when iterates by addition modulo 2 cellular automata starting from a convex combination of strong mixing probability measures can converge. This also gives all invariant measures inside the class of those probability measures. We can obtain a similar result for iterates by addition modulo an odd prime number cellular automata starting from strong mixing probability measures.

9a9f95c0b14239c14ce444ecfd5dd1f107bcd4aa	a novel beamforming algorithm for gnss receivers with dual-polarized sensitive arrays in the joint space–time-polarization domain	gnss receiver;array antenna;beamforming;dual-polarized sensitive array (dpsa);interference mitigation;space–time-polarization adaptive processing (stpap)	Dual-polarized sensitive arrays (DPSAs) with the space⁻time-polarization adaptive processing (STPAP) technique, which employs the polarization domain as well as the space domain and time domain to filter out interferences, can cancel a larger number of wideband interferences for GNSS receivers. However, the traditional STPAP beamforming algorithm, which requires a separate adaptive filter for each GNSS satellite, will make the process computationally intensive as there are multiple GNSS satellites in the field of view (FOV). In order to overcome the shortcoming, a novel STPAP beamforming algorithm based on the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) criterion is proposed. Compared with the traditional STPAP beamforming algorithm, the proposed STPAP beamforming algorithm can process multiple GNSS satellites at once using only one adaptive filter, which will greatly reduce the computational complexity. Moreover, the proposed algorithm will not lead to a sharp deterioration in the output carrier-to-noise density ratio (C/N₀) performance if the number of GNSS satellites processed in the same adaptive filter is proper. Furthermore, to calculate weight vector iteratively, an adaptive algorithm based on the constrained least mean square (CLMS) method is derived for the proposed STPAP beamforming algorithm. Simulation results validate that the proposed algorithm is effective in mitigating interferences for GNSS receivers in the joint space⁻time-polarization domain and meanwhile has lower computational complexity when maintaining the output C/N₀ performance close to that of the traditional STPAP algorithm.

We define a special Kneser hypergraph and, by using some topological results and the well-known λ-Helly property, we relate our second question to the chromatic number of such hypergraphs. Moreover, we establish a connection (when λ = 1) with Kneser’s conjecture, first proved by Lovász.

This paper shows that, for the case of localization with range-finders, Fisher's matrix is a function of the expected readings and of the orientation of the environment's surfaces at the sensed points. The matrix also offers a mathematically sound way to characterize under-constrained situations as those for which it is singular: in those cases the kernel describes the direction of maximum uncertainty. This paper also introduces a simple model of unstructured environments for which the Cramer-Rao bound is a function of two statistics of the shape of the environment: the average radius and a measure of the irregularity of the surfaces. Although this model is not valid for all environments, it allows for some interesting qualitative considerations. As an experimental validation, this paper reports simulations comparing the bound with the actual performance of the ICP (iterative closest/corresponding point) algorithm. Finally, it is discussed the difficulty in extending these results to find a lower bound for accuracy in scan matching and SLAM.	algorithm;formation matrix;iterative method;simulation;simultaneous localization and mapping;the matrix	Andrea Censi	2007	Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ROBOT.2007.364120	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;fisher information;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	50.50328252344727	5.587291533082583	33286

In this paper, we consider a graph Sn derived from the first n iterations of the process that leads to Σ, and study some of its properties, including its cycle structure, domination number and pebbling number.

The standard approach involves constructing an unavoidable finite set of reducible configurations to demonstrate that aminimal counterexample cannot exist. We study the 4-color problem fromadifferent perspective. Instead of planar triangulations, we consider near-triangulations of the plane with a face of size 4; we call any such graph an a-graph. We state an a-graph coloring problem equivalent to the 4-color problem and then derive a coloring condition that a minimal a-graph counterexample must satisfy, expressing it in terms of equivalence classes under Kempe exchanges. Through a systematic search,wediscover a family of a-graphs that satisfy the coloring condition, the fundamental member of which has order 12 and includes the Birkhoff diamond as a subgraph. Higher-order members include a string of Birkhoff diamonds. However, no member has an applicable parent triangulation that is internally 6-connected, a requirement for a minimal counterexample. Our research suggests strongly that the coloring and connectivity conditions for aminimal counterexample are incompatible; infinitelymany a-graphsmeet one condition or the other, but we find none that meets both. © 2016 The Author(s).

All graphs considered in this article are assumed to be planar unless otherwise stated. V (G) denotes the vertex set of the graph G. Two vertices are adjacent if they share an edge. Such an edge is said to be incident to the two vertices it joins. A triangulation is a graph in which all faces are delineated by three edges and a near-triangulation is a graph in which all faces but one are delineated by three edges. In this article, we refer to the edges delineating the sole non-triangular face in a near-triangulation as the boundary of the graph and the vertices on the boundary as boundary vertices. Vertices not on the boundary are referred to as interior vertices. An internal path is one having no edge on the boundary. A separating n-cycle inG has vertices ofG both inside and outside the n-cycle. A connected graph is k-connected if it has more than k vertices and remains connected whenever fewer than k vertices are deleted. In an r-regular graph, all vertices have degree r . A proper vertex-coloring of G is a coloring of V (G) in which no two adjacent vertices have the same color. The only graph colorings we consider are proper vertex-colorings; we often refer to themmerely as colorings. We use the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4,. . . , to denote the different colors available for coloring a graph. We often use the term 4-coloring to mean any coloring using no more than 4 colors. The expression c(w) translates as the color of vertex w in the coloring c . A Kempe chain is a maximal connected subgraph of G whose vertices in a coloring of G use only two colors.

Tilley / Discrete Applied Mathematics ( ) – that uses the colors j and k is referred to as a j-k chain. A vertex w colored j that is not adjacent to any vertex colored k ≠ j is a single-vertex or short j-k Kempe chain. Exchanging colors j and k for such a chain is the same as changing the color of w to k. For purposes of this article, a Kempe exchange is a recoloring ofG inwhich the colors j and k are exchanged in a designated, non-empty, proper subset of all j-k Kempe chains. For example, if G has three pairwise disjoint 1–2 Kempe chains, then exchanging colors on any one or any two counts as a single Kempe exchange.	birkhoff interpolation;connectivity (graph theory);four color theorem;graph coloring;kempe chain;maximal set;neighbourhood (graph theory);norsk data;planar graph;triangulation (geometry);turing completeness;vertex (graph theory);witsenhausen's counterexample	James A.

The TFDs of this subclass are characterized by their time-lag kernels which are functions of time only. In this paper, we report the results of our investigation related to the time and frequency resolution of the T-class TFDs. It is shown, analytically, for the case of a linear chirp, that the frequency resolution is a function of both the smoothing parameter of the TFD kernel and the rate of change in instantaneous frequency. The results are then illustrated with a number of synthetic examples.	chirp;instantaneous phase;smoothing;synthetic intelligence	Luke Rankine;Mostefa Mesbah;Boualem Boashash	2007	2007 9th International Symposium on Signal Processing and Its Applications	10.1109/ISSPA.2007.4555327	probability distribution;instantaneous phase;fourier transform;econometrics;kernel;speech recognition;time–frequency analysis;mathematics;quantum mechanics;statistics	Arch	53.75119652584419	14.39718003097045	33522

This paper explores the benefits of investing additional search effort at cut-nodes by also expanding some of the remaining moves. Our results show a strong correlation between the number of promising move alternatives at cut-nodes and a new principal variation emerging. Furthermore, a new forward-pruning method is introduced that uses this additional information to ignore potentially futile subtrees. We also provide experimental results with the new pruning method in the domain of chess.		Yngvi Björnsson;T. Anthony Marsland	2001	Theor. Comput.

Thus, Tutte’s famous theorem asserts that 00 is not a root of μ(G,x)μ(G,x) if and only if codd(G−S)≤|S| for all S⊆V(G)S⊆V(G), where codd(G) denotes the number of odd components of GG. Tutte’s theorem can be proved using a characterization of the structure of maximal non-matchable graphs, that is, the edge-maximal graphs among those having no perfect matching. In this paper, we prove a generalized version of Tutte’s theorem in terms of avoiding any given real number θθ as a root of μ(G,x)μ(G,x). We also extend maximal non-matchable graphs to maximal θθ-non-matchable graphs and determine the structure of such graphs.	maximal set;tutte polynomial;tutte theorem	Cheng Yeaw Ku;Kok Bin Wong	2013	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.disc.2013.05.015	tutte matrix;chromatic polynomial;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;best theorem;topology;nowhere-zero flow;mathematics;tutte theorem;algebra	Theory	31.22184806974903	30.336777923036152	33691

This is a doubly stochastic random process with an underlying continuous-time finite-state homogeneous Markov chain. Conditioned on that chain, the observable process is a continuous-time finite-state nonhomogeneous Markov chain. The generator of the observable process at any given time is determined by the state of the underlying Markov chain at that time. The parameter of the process comprises the set of generators for the underlying and conditional Markov chains. The proposed approach generalizes an earlier approach by Ryden for estimating the parameter of a Markov modulated Poisson process.	doubly stochastic model;expectation–maximization algorithm;markov chain;modulation;observable;stochastic process	Yariv Ephraim;William J.

The classification scheme proposed circumvents the problems associated with isolating whether complexity is in fact intrinsic to a dynamical rule, or if it arises merely as a product of a complex initial state. Transfer entropy variations processed by cellular automata split the 256 elementary rules into three information classes, based on sensitivity to initial conditions. These classes form a hierarchy such that coarse-graining transitions observed among elementary rules predominately occur within each information-based class or, muchmore rarely, down the hierarchy.	automata theory;dynamical system;elementary cellular automaton;initial condition;transfer entropy	Enrico Borriello;Sara Imari Walker	2017	Complexity	10.1155/2017/1280351	stochastic cellular automaton;discrete mathematics;growcut algorithm;mobile automaton	Theory	46.97865121203256	20.33872206865285	33900

We consider this problem from the perspective of expected query time. We are given the probabilities pz that the query point lies within each cell z ∈ S. The entropy H of the resulting discrete probability distribution is the dominant term in the lower bound on the expectedcase query time. We show that it is possible to achieve query time H +O( √ H +1) with space O(n), which is optimal up to lower order terms in the query time. We extend this result to subdivisions with convex cells, assuming a uniform query distribution within each cell. In order to achieve space efficiency, we introduce the concept of entropy-preserving cuttings.	data structure;like button;planar straight-line graph;point location;preprocessor;subdivision surface	Sunil Arya;Theocharis Malamatos;David M.

It works in cases where isophotes, reflection lines, planar intersection curves, or other curves are used to judge the fairness of the surface. The surface fairness measure is derived by demanding that all the given curves should be fair with respect to an appropriate curve fairness measure. The method is applied to the field of ship hull design where the curves are plane intersections. The method is extended to the case where one considers, not the fairness of one curve, but the fairness of a one parameter family of curves. Six basic third order invariants by which the fairing measures can be expressed are defined. Furthermore, the geometry of a plane intersection curve is studied, and the variation of the total, the normal, and the geodesic curvature and the geodesic torsion is determined.	contour line;fairness measure;geodesic convexity;mathematical optimization;reflection lines;steen rasmussen;tom;torsion (gastropod)	Jens Gravesen;Michael Ungstrup	2002	Adv.

Our algorithm is ideally suited for a practical use because: (i) it is extremely simple and robust, and (ii) despite this simplicity (or rather because of it) the algorithm is optimal; its expected running time is O(m+n log n), where n is the number of input segments and m is the number of points of intersection. The storage requirement is O(m + n). Though the algorithm itself is simple, the global evolution of the underlying partition is non-trivial, which makes the analysis of the algorithm theoretically interesting in its own right.	algorithm	Ketan Mulmuley	1990	J.

It is proved that then G can be drawn in the plane with at most cχdn crossings, where cχ is a constant depending only on χ. This result, which is tight up to a constant factor, is strengthened and generalized to the case when there is no restriction on the degrees of the vertices.	crossing number (graph theory);euler characteristic;graph (discrete mathematics);vertex (geometry)	Károly J.

To guarantee the accuracy of the identification of close sources (the smallest angle difference is 1°) by PARAFAC algorithm, increasing the number of sensors is a solution. Another way is to select the optimal number of sensors which is mainly influenced by three factors: signal to noise ratio (SNR), the number of sources and the range of angles. In this paper, we have fitted the function between the optimal number of sensors and one of the three factors respectively based on the results obtained by PARAFAC decomposition. Then the function between the optimal number of sensors and all three factors is concluded from the three fitting functions. In different cases, we have tested that the number of sensors calculated from this function is close to the optimal number of sensors estimated by PARAFAC decomposition.	algorithm;natural deduction;numerical analysis;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio	Xuefeng Liu;Salah Bourennane;Caroline Fossati	2012	2012 8th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP)	10.1109/CSNDSP.2012.6292756	mathematics;accuracy and precision;stress;signal-to-noise ratio;statistics	Mobile	51.30394617271477	6.226021778838401	34087

The optimization of the multiphase Mumford-Shah energy functional has been performed using level sets methods that optimize the Mumford-Shah energy by evolving the level sets via the gradient descent. These methods are very slow and prone to getting stuck in local optima due to the use of the gradient descent. After the reformulation of the bimodal Mumford-Shah functional on a graph, several groups investigated the hierarchical extension of the graph representation to multi class. These approaches, though more effective than level sets, provide approximate solutions and can diverge away from the optimal solution. In this paper, we present a discrete optimization for the multiphase Mumford Shah functional that directly minimizes the multiphase functional without recursive bisection on the labels. Our approach handles the nonsubmodularity of the multiphase energy function and provide a global optimum if prior information is provided.	approximation algorithm;continuous optimization;discrete optimization;global optimization;gradient descent;graph (abstract data type);image segmentation;local optimum;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;mumford–shah functional;noise reduction;numerical analysis;optimization problem;recursion;submodular set function	Noha Youssry El-Zehiry;Leo Grady	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-23094-3_17	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;machine learning;mathematics	Vision	33.668592388807255	7.306037287310583	34136

cb872edf0d1b77f0a95c53f126f630e29bcd3c0c	the random hypergraph assignment problem		Parisi’s famous (proven) conjecture states that the expected cost of an optimal assignment in a complete bipartite graph on n + n nodes with i. i. d. exponential edge costs with mean 1 is ∑n i=1 1/i , which converges to an asymptotic limit of π/6 as n tends to infinity. We consider a generalization of this question to complete “partitioned” bipartite hypergraphs G2,n that contain edges of size two and proper hyperedges of size four. We conjecture that for i. i. d. uniform hyperedge costs on [0, 1] and i. i. d. exponential hyperedge costs with mean 1, optimal assignments expectedly contain half of the maximum possible number of proper hyperedges. We prove that under the assumption of this number of proper hyperedges the asymptotic expected minimum cost of a hyperassignment lies between 0.3718 and 1.8310 if hyperedge costs are i. i. d. exponential random variables with mean 1. We also consider an application-inspired cost function which favors proper hyperedges over edges by means of an edge penalty parameter p. We show how results for an arbitrary p can be deduced from results for p = 0.	assignment problem;asymptote;loss function;time complexity	Ralf Borndörfer;Olga Heismann	2015	Informatica (Slovenia)		mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics	Theory	37.44796885667713	16.984342803694677	34169

This is a genuine extension of the same-named topological concept since every Boolean (or, even more emphatically, every paracompact) locale is isocompact. A slightly stronger variant is defined by decreeing that the closure of every complemented countably compact sublocale be compact. Dropping the adjective “complemented” yields a formally even stronger property, which we show to be preserved by finite products. Metrizable locales (or, more generally, perfectly normal locales) do not distinguish between the three variants of isocompactness. Each of the stronger variants of isocompactness travels across a proper map of locales, and in the opposite direction if the map is a surjection in Loc.

3a19e1a1d6892cd3cb8908d288ee1908981b7c44	a combinatorial model of two-sided search		We study a new model of combinatorial group testing in a network. An object the target occupies an unknown node in the network. At each time instant, we can test or query a subset of the nodes to learn whether the target occupies any of such nodes. Unlike the case of conventional group testing problems on graphs, the target in our model can move immediately after each test to any node adjacent to each present location. The search finishes when we are able to locate the object with some predefined accuracy s a parameter fixed beforehand, i.e., to indicate a set of s nodes that include the location of the object.rnrnIn this paper we study two types of problems related to the above model: i what is the minimum value of the accuracy parameter for which a search strategy in the above sense exists; ii given the accuracy, what is the minimum number of tests that allow to locate the target. We study these questions on paths, cycles, and trees as underlying graphs and provide tight answer for the above questions. We also considered a restricted variant of the problem, where the number of moves of the target is bounded.		Harout K. Aydinian;Ferdinando Cicalese;Christian Deppe;Vladimir S. Lebedev	2018	Int. J.

These specific classes depend on the way chosen to build the graphs representing the problems to solve. We study here all possible ways of building graphs and the associated energies minimized, leading to the exhaustive family of energies minimizable exactly by a graph cut. To do this, we consider the issue of coding pixel labels as states of the graph, i.e. the choice of state interpretations. The family obtained comprises many new classes, in particular energies that do not satisfy the submodularity condition, including energies that are even not permuted-submodular. A generating subfamily is studied in details, in particular we propose a canonical form to represent Markov random fields, which proves useful to recognize energies in this subfamily in linear complexity almost surely, and then to build the associated graph in quasilinear time. A few experiments are performed, to illustrate the new possibilities offered.	cut (graph theory);experiment;graph (discrete mathematics);graph cuts in computer vision;markov chain;markov random field;pixel;polynomial;submodular set function;time complexity	Guillaume Charpiat	2011	CVPR 2011	10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995567	frequency modulation;time complexity;canonical form;computer vision;mathematical optimization;labeling theory;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;cut;clique-width;graph theory;forbidden graph characterization;machine learning;mathematics;voltage graph;geometry;markov process;silicon;computational complexity theory;energy minimization;writing;complement graph;statistics;satisfiability	Vision	40.82154488594953	15.665181598976998	34311

The first is to find a partition of the vertex set into m parts so as to minimize the sparsity of the partition (defined as the ratio of the weight of edges between parts to the total weight of edges incident to the smallest m − 1 parts). The second, that has appeared in the context of understanding the unique games conjecture, is to find a subset of minimum sparsity that contains at most a 1/m fraction of the vertices. Our main results are extensions of Cheeger’s classical inequality to these problems via higher eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian. In particular, for the sparsest m-partition, we prove that the sparsity is at most 8 √ 1− λm logm where λm is the m largest eigenvalue of the normalized adjacency matrix. For sparsest small-set, we bound the sparsity by O( √ (1− λm2) logm). Our results are algorithmic, with the first using a recursive spectral decomposition and the second using a convex relaxation.	adjacency matrix;algorithm;cut (graph theory);laplacian matrix;linear programming relaxation;recursion;singular value decomposition;social inequality;sparse matrix;unique games conjecture	Anand Louis;Prasad Raghavendra;Prasad Tetali;Santosh Vempala	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-22935-0_27	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics	Theory	26.517850445260024	24.692949136710332	34415

One of our main results is a necessary and sufficient condition for a map G to be a watershed of a map F, this condition is based on a notion of extension. A consequence of the theorem is that there exists a (greedy) polynomial time algorithm to decide whether a map G is a watershed of a map F or not. We introduce a notion of “separation between two points” of an image which leads to a second necessary and sufficient condition. We also show that, given an arbitrary total order on the minima of a map, it is possible to define a notion of “degree of separation of a minimum” relative to this order. This leads to a third necessary and sufficient condition for a map G to be a watershed of a map F. At last we derive, from our framework, a new definition for the dynamics of a minimum.	bertrand (programming language);file spanning;greedy algorithm;maxima and minima;minimum spanning tree;p (complexity);polynomial;six degrees of separation;thinning;time complexity;watershed (image processing)	Gilles Bertrand	2005	Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision	10.1007/s10851-005-4891-5	mathematical optimization;dynamics;discrete space;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematical morphology;topology;watershed;mathematics;graph;total order	Theory	35.548165974258836	21.688052272001407	34581
0db8820583445f55dbf180897381cb17087a4011	sequential metric dimension		In the localization game, introduced by Seager in 2013, an invisible and immobile target is hidden at some vertex of a graph G. At every step, one vertex v of G can be probed which results in the knowledge of the distance between v and the secret location of the target. The objective of the game is to minimize the number of steps needed to locate the target whatever be its location. We address the generalization of this game where k ≥ 1 vertices can be probed at every step. Our game also generalizes the notion of the metric dimension of a graph. Precisely, given a graph G and two integers k, ` ≥ 1, the Localization Problem asks whether there exists a strategy to locate a target hidden in G in at most ` steps and probing at most k vertices per step. We first show that this problem is NP-complete when k (resp., `) is a fixed parameter. Our main results concern the study of the Localization Problem in the class of trees. We prove that this problem is NP-complete in trees when k and ` are part of the input. On the positive side, we design a (+1)-approximation in n-node trees, i.e., an algorithm that computes in time O(n logn) (independent of k) a strategy to locate the target in at most one more step than an optimal strategy. This algorithm can be used to solve the Localization Problem in trees in polynomial-time if k is fixed.

In an m by n board, there are mn pieces numbered from 1 to mn. Initially, the pieces are placed in ascending order. Then they are scrambled by rotating the rows and columns without the player’s knowledge. The objective of the torus puzzle is to rearrange the pieces in ascending order by rotating the rows and columns. We provide a solution to this puzzle. In addition, we provide lower and upper bounds on the number of steps for solving the puzzle. Moreover, we consider a variant of the torus puzzle in which each piece is colored either black or white, and we present a hardness result for solving it.	15 puzzle;column (database);order by;sorting	Kazuyuki Amano;Yuta Kojima;Toshiya Kurabayashi;Keita Kurihara;Masahiro Nakamura;Ayaka Omi;Toshiyuki Tanaka;Koichi Yamazaki	2012	Algorithms	10.3390/a5010018	five room puzzle;computer science;mathematics;geometry;algorithm;slothouber–graatsma puzzle	ML	28.388669524068035	19.518365004563886	34596

It often happens that M1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Ms ∼= N1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Nt for indecomposable R-modules M1, . . . , Ms and N1, . . . , Nt with s 6= t. This behavior can be captured by studying the commutative monoid {[M ] |M is an R-module} of isomorphism classes of R-modules with operation given by [M ]+[N ] = [M⊕N ]. In this mostly self-contained exposition, we introduce the reader to the interplay between the the study of direct-sum decompositions of modules and the study of factorizations in integral domains.

820a2d07bfdd828347cc3d2cf73326e074589df3	a characterization of domination weak bicritical graphs with large diameter		The domination number of a graph $G$, denoted by $\gamma (G)$, is the minimum cardinality of a dominating set of $G$. A vertex of a graph is called critical if its deletion decreases the domination number, and a graph is called critical if its all vertices are critical. A graph $G$ is called weak bicritical if for every non-critical vertex $x\in V(G)$, $G-x$ is a critical graph with $\gamma (G-x)=\gamma (G)$. In this paper, we characterize the connected weak bicritical graphs $G$ whose diameter is exactly $2\gamma (G)-2$. This is a generalization of some known results concerning the diameter of graphs with a domination-criticality.	dominating set	Michitaka Furuya	2018	Graphs and Combinatorics	10.1007/s00373-018-1930-8	graph power;pathwidth;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;degree;graph toughness;regular graph;cycle graph;vertex;symmetric graph;mathematics;vertex-transitive graph;complement graph;line graph;neighbourhood;string graph	Theory	27.986219741801033	29.313926873689127	34842
2447112f5b0f96d8aa0e265a45875f7813e4684f	improved purely additive fault-tolerant spanners	settore inf 01 informatica	Let G be an unweighted n-node undirected graph. A βadditive spanner of G is a spanning subgraph H of G such that distances in H are stretched at most by an additive term β w.r.t. the corresponding distances in G. A natural research goal related with spanners is that of designing sparse spanners with low stretch. In this paper, we focus on fault-tolerant additive spanners, namely additive spanners which are able to preserve their additive stretch even when one edge fails. We are able to improve all known such spanners, in terms of either sparsity or stretch. In particular, we consider the sparsest known spanners with stretch 6, 28, and 38, and reduce the stretch to 4, 10, and 14, respectively (while keeping the same sparsity). Our results are based on two different constructions. On one hand, we show how to augment (by adding a small number of edges) a faulttolerant additive sourcewise spanner (that approximately preserves distances only from a given set of source nodes) into one such spanner that preserves all pairwise distances. On the other hand, we show how to augment some known fault-tolerant additive spanners, based on clustering techniques. This way we decrease the additive stretch without any asymptotic increase in their size. We also obtain improved fault-tolerant additive spanners for the case of one vertex failure, and for the case of f edge failures.	additive model;cluster analysis;fault tolerance;file spanning;geometric spanner;graph (discrete mathematics);sparse matrix;utility functions on indivisible goods	Davide Bilò;Fabrizio Grandoni;Luciano Gualà;Stefano Leucci;Guido Proietti	2015		10.1007/978-3-662-48350-3_15	combinatorics;computer science;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	26.8339334233477	22.39963999480689	34879

For instance, Max Cut asks for the largest bipartite subgraph of a graph G, while Min Bisection asks for the minimum size of a cut into two equal pieces. In judicious partitioning problems, we seek to maximize or minimize a number of quantities simultaneously. For instance, given a graph G with m edges, we can ask for the smallest f(m) such that G must have a bipartition in which each vertex class contains at most f(m) edges. In this survey, we discuss recent extremal results on a variety of questions concerning judicious partitions, and related problems such as Max Cut.	cut (graph theory);disk partitioning;graph (discrete mathematics);maxima and minima;maximum cut	Alex D.

It is shown that the approximation criterion used, viz. minimising the maximum orthogonal deviation, is best modelled mathematically through the concept of aparallel body. This notion, besides being a valuable tool for form assessment in metrology, contributes to approximation theory by introducing a new kind of approximation, here called “geometric” or “orthogonal”. This approach is closely related to but different from Chebyshev approximation.	algorithm;approximation theory;mathematical model;viz: the computer game	Rudolf Drieschner	1993	Numerical Algorithms	10.1007/BF02108666	mathematical optimization;approximation error;muffin-tin approximation;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;equioscillation theorem;approximation;calculus;mathematics;formative assessment;minimax approximation algorithm;approximation algorithm;approximation theory	Theory	48.23540466958159	25.095923541395063	35421

Because many classes of algorithms do not readily decompose, one seeks some other basis for parallelism (i.e., for using additional hardware to obtain higher processing speed). In this paper we argue that """"parallel guessing"""" for image analysis is a useful approach, and that several recent IU algorithms are based on this concept. Problems suitable for this approach have the characteristic that either """"distance"""" from a true solution, or the correctness of a guess, can be readily checked. We review image-analysis algorithms having a parallel guessing or randomness flavor. We envision a parallel set of computers, each of which carries out a computation on a data set using some random or guessing process, and communicates the """"goodness"""" of its result to its co-workers through a """"blackboard"""" mechanism."""	computation	Martin A.

This means that any generic realisation is uniquely determined up to congruence when each edge represents a fixed length constraint. Hendrickson gave two natural necessary conditions, one involving connectivity and the other redundant rigidity. In general these are not sufficient, but they do suffice in two dimensions, as shown by Jackson and Jordán. Our main result is an analogue of the redundant rigidity condition for frameworks that have both direction and length constraints. For any generic globally rigid direction-length framework in R with at least 2 length edges, we show that deleting any length edge results in a rigid framework. It seems harder to obtain a corresponding result when a direction edge is deleted: we can do this in two dimensions, under an additional hypothesis that we believe to be unnecessary. Our proofs use a lemma of independent interest, stating that a certain space parameterising equivalent frameworks is a smooth manifold. We prove this lemma using arguments from differential topology and the Tarski-Seidenberg theorem on semi-algebraic sets.	algorithm;congruence of squares;jackson;linear algebra;polynomial;semiconductor industry	Bill Jackson;Peter Keevash	2011	Discrete & Computational Geometry	10.1007/s00454-011-9326-z	combinatorics;two-dimensional space;topology;mathematics;geometry	Theory	36.337472727436754	24.680899205763723	35477

It explores the practical implications of improving the efficiency with which transportation problems can be solved. By using appropriate techniques for storing data elements and manipulating their structural relationships, a computer procedure, which is quite efficient in terms of central processor execution time and core storage requirements, is developed. Computational results using a FORTRAN program on test problems ranging in size from 15 sources and 25 destinations to 30 sources and 400 destinations are presented and discussed. These results indicate that the method of implementation is instrumental in reducing the effect of problem size on computational requirements. The paper emphasizes the general principles of the implementation rather than those aspects which are specifically related to the language and computer used for experimentation. Also, the applicability of the research is extended by an investigation of the potential for using the implementation concepts with other algorithms.	analysis of algorithms;central processing unit;computation;core storage;data structure;ford–fulkerson algorithm;fortran;requirement;run time (program lifecycle phase);transportation theory (mathematics)	William G.

d0f575e4b9d1d535c42b351c71010e09f7938153	computing the hausdorff distance of two sets from their signed distance functions		The Hausdorff distance is a measure of (dis-)similarity between two sets which is widely used in various applications. Most of the applied literature is devoted to the computation for sets consisting of a finite number of points. This has applications, for instance, in image processing. However, we would like to apply the Hausdorff distance to control and evaluate optimisation methods in level-set based shape optimisation. In this context, the involved sets are not finite point sets but characterised by level-set or signed distance functions. This paper discusses the computation of the Hausdorff distance between two such sets. We recall fundamental properties of the Hausdorff distance, including a characterisation in terms of distance functions. In numerical applications, this result gives at least an exact lower bound on the Hausdorff distance. We also derive an upper bound, and consequently a precise error estimate. By giving an example, we show that our error estimate cannot be further improved for a general situation. On the other hand, we also show that much better accuracy can be expected for non-pathological situations that are more likely to occur in practice. The resulting error estimate can be improved even further if one assumes that the grid is rotated randomly with respect to the involved sets.

This provides a characterization of the monotone polar of subdifferentials of lower semicontinuous functions: it is a common subset of their graphs which depends only on the function.	monotone	Marc Lassonde	2014	Optimization Letters	10.1007/s11590-013-0693-7	subderivative;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;topology;mathematics	Theory	41.673511019239015	24.004957688170137	35629
b25ad7ad44c9f1921dc0509cdc4f5fecf459df2c	on a conjecture of sokal concerning roots of the independence polynomial		A conjecture of Sokal [22] regarding the domain of non-vanishing for independence polynomials of graphs, states that given any natural number ∆ ≥ 3, there exists a neighborhood in C of the interval [0, (∆−1) ∆−1 (∆−2)∆ ) on which the independence polynomial of any graph with maximum degree at most ∆ does not vanish. We show here that Sokal’s Conjecture holds, as well as a multivariate version, and prove optimality for the domain of non-vanishing. An important step is to translate the setting to the language of complex dynamical systems.	berman–hartmanis conjecture;complex dynamics;dynamical system;polynomial;universal quantification	Han Peters;Guus Regts	2017	CoRR		combinatorics;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;mathematics;geometry;algebra	Theory	39.16609651904356	27.233912635804984	35630
61c4a26258f476305bc211d1a644dfc2951cebd7	sculptures in concurrency		We give a formalization of Pratt’s intuitive sculpting process for higher-dimensional automata (HDA). Based on this, we show that sculptures, Pratt’s Chu spaces, and Johansen’s ST-structures are in close correspondence. We also develop an algorithm to decide whether a HDA can be sculpted and use this to show that some natural acyclic HDA are not sculptures. We believe that this contradicts Pratt’s intuition that sculpting suffices for modeling of concurrent behavior. We also show that there are sculptures whose unfoldings cannot be sculpted, and that sculptures are the same as Euclidean cubical complexes. This exposes a close connection between geometric and combinatorial models for concurrency which may be of use for both areas.

The optimal recombination is studied in the case where a vector of binary variables is used as a solution encoding. By means of efficient reductions of the optimal recombination problems (ORPs) we show the polynomial solvability of the ORPs for the maximum weight set packing problem, the minimum weight set partition problem, and for linear Boolean programming problems with at most two variables per inequality, and some other problems. We also identify several NP-hard cases of optimal recombination: the Boolean linear programming problems with three variables per inequality, the knapsack, the set covering, the p-median, and some other problems.	acclimatization;arabic numeral 0;boolean;decision problem;evolutionary algorithm;genetic algorithm;heuristic (computer science);heuristics;linear programming;matching (graph theory);mathematical optimization;maximum flow problem;minimum cut;minimum weight;mutation;np-hardness;optimization problem;partition problem;polynomial;population parameter;randomized algorithm;recombination, genetic;set packing;social inequality;solutions;surgical revision;time complexity;whole earth 'lectronic link	Anton V.

7549bbc80a54f3f875ba7b23496c4d9a7d99a024	on extendable planes of order ten		Abstract   It is well known that the only way of extending a projective plane of order  n  (conceivable orders are 2, 4 and 10) is adjoining a set of hyperovals to the given projective plane. A converse is proved in this note. It is shown as a corollary that the existence of an extendable plane of order 10 is equivalent to the existence of a quasi-symmetric 2-(111, 12, 10)-design.	extensibility	Sharad S. Sane	1985	J. Comb.

The forward projection on such a set is motivated by some works of Tsallis et al. in statistical physics, and the reverse projection is motivated by robust statistics. In a recent work, van Erven and Harremoës proved a Pythagorean inequality for Rényi divergences on α-convex sets under the assumption that the forward projection exists. Continuing this study, a sufficient condition for the existence of a forward projection is proved for probability measures on a general alphabet. For α ϵ (1, ∞), the proof relies on a new Apollonius theorem for the Hellinger divergence, and for α E (0, 1), the proof relies on the Banach- Alaoglu theorem from the functional analysis. Further projection results are then obtained in the finite alphabet setting. These include a projection theorem on a specific α-convex set, which is termed an α-linear family, generalizing a result by Csiszar to α ≠ 1. The solution to this problem yields a parametric family of probability measures, which turns out to be an extension of the exponential family, and it is termed an α-exponential family. An orthogonality relationship between the α-exponential and α-linear families is established, and it is used to turn the reverse projection on an α-exponential family into a forward projection on an α-linear family. This paper also proves a convergence result of an iterative procedure used to calculate the forward projection on an intersection of a finite number of α-linear families.	iterative method;kullback–leibler divergence;rényi entropy;social inequality;time complexity	M.

58bb3415708ae72917abd02f1d85278b7338cc77	on 132-representable graphs		A graph G = (V,E) is word-representable if there exists a word w over the alphabet V such that letters x and y alternate in w if and only if xy is an edge in E. Word-representable graphs are the subject of a long research line in the literature, and they are the main focus in the recently published book “Words and Graphs” by Kitaev and Lozin. A word w = w1 · · ·wn avoids the pattern 132 if there are no 1 ≤ i1 < i2 < i3 ≤ n such that wi1 < wi3 < wi2 . The theory of patterns in words and permutations is a fast growing area. A recently suggested research direction is in merging the theories of word-representable graphs and patterns in words. Namely, given a class of pattern-avoiding words, can we describe the class of graphs represented by the words? We say that a graph is 132-representable if it can be represented by a 132-avoiding word. We show that each 132-representable graph is necessarily a circle graph. Also, we show that any tree and any cycle graph are 132-representable. Finally, we provide explicit 132-avoiding representations for all graphs on at most five vertices, and also describe all such representations, and enumerate them, for complete graphs.		Alice L. L.

A positive answer can be derived from Birkhoffs Theorem: One regards the basis as an abstract partial order which is represented as a suborder of the Boolean lattice of subsets of the item set. If this set representation consists of the lower cones of the partial order then the knowledge space is ordinal (or quasi ordinal if slight modifications are observed). Some partial orders have the property that all their set representations which are parsimonious in a certain sense are equal to the representation by its lower cones. These orders allow only ordinal knowledge spaces. They are characterized by a special condition which generalizes the interval order condition.	knowledge space	Reinhold Suck	1999	Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/S1571-0653(04)00044-7	first uncountable ordinal;partially ordered set;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;interval order;ordinal analysis;mathematics;limit ordinal;ordinal arithmetic;well-order	Theory	39.61111337845185	28.207659405380355	36124

We considered the space, q~, of all maps from an abelian group G to f2 U { -oc} , called LG-fuzzy sets, where (2 is a complete lattice ordered group; and we defined TI operators on this space. In this paper thresholding is considered in the same general framework, and in this regard, positive TI operators are studied. The threshold of an LG-fuzzy set A at level t is defined to be the set {g C G :A(g)>~t}. Also, a TI operator is defined to be positive if its kernel consists of elements which are positive except possibly at some points which are o c . As the main result of this note, it is proved that a positive and isotone T1 operator commutes with thresholding if and only if it has a crisp kernel (or base).

The usual definition of degeneracy is restricted to vertices of a polyhedron. We introduce degeneracy for nonempty subsets of polyhedra and show that for linear programming models for which the feasible region contains at least one vertex holds that the dimension of the optimal face is equal to the degeneracy degree of the optimal face of the corresponding dual model. This result is obtained by means of so-called Balinski-Tucker Simplex Tableaus. Furthermore, we give a strong polynomial algorithm for constructing such a Balinski-Tucker Simplex Tableau when an optimal interior point solution is known.	computer program;degeneracy (graph theory);feasible region;lp-type problem;linear programming;method of analytic tableaux;polyhedron;polynomial;simplex algorithm;time complexity;tucker decomposition	Gert A.

Due to the flexibility of the method, the algorithm can be executed relying on the Nyström approximation, reducing computational complexity to that of a few matrix multiplications.

Over a decade ago, Hutchinson, Shermer, and Vince proved that any n-vertex graph with geometric thickness two can have at most 6n−18 edges, and for every n ≥ 8 they constructed a geometric thickness-two graph with 6n− 20 edges. In this paper, we construct geometric thickness-two graphs with 6n−19 edges for every n ≥ 9, which improves the previously known 6n− 20 lower bound. We then construct a thickness-two graph with 10 vertices that has geometric thickness three, and prove that the problem of recognizing geometric thickness-two graphs is NPhard, answering two questions posed by Dillencourt, Eppstein and Hirschberg. Finally, we prove the NP-hardness of coloring graphs of geometric thickness t with 4t− 1 colors, which strengthens a result of McGrae and Zito, when t = 2.	color;existential quantification;graph coloring;hirschberg's algorithm;line drawing algorithm;np-hardness;thickness (graph theory)	Stephane Durocher;Ellen Gethner;Debajyoti Mondal	2016	Comput.

Ardila, Benedetti, and Doker (2010) expressed polytopes of this type as Minkowski sums and differences of dilated faces of a standard simplex and computed the corresponding coefficients yI by Möbius inversion. Given an associahedron of Hohlweg and Lange, we give a new combinatorial interpretation of the values yI : they are the product of two signed lengths of paths of the labeled n-gon. We also discuss an explicit realisation of a cyclohedron to show that that the formula of Ardila, Benedetti, and Doker does not hold for generalised permutahedra not in the deformation cone of the classical permutahderon.	coefficient;minkowski functional	Carsten Lange	2011			combinatorics;topology;mathematics;geometry	Theory	36.68623623444207	24.084339121461102	36607

Here we explore the diversity of spirals that arise from nonstandard neighborhoods on the integer lattice and from looking at the automata on quasi-crystalline arrangements of cells. We see that phase transitions and development of spirals are almost ubiquitous yet the particular form of the spirals is very dependent upon the particulars of the underlying neighborhoods; in fact the spiral forms echo the neighborhoods. The quasi-crystalline illustrations provide much more subtle echoes in the spiral forms that show artifacts from the non-periodic local symmetry that occurs.	automata theory;cyclic cellular automaton	Clifford A.

As foldover designs require twice as many runs as the initial design, they can be inefficient if the number of effects to be dealiased is smaller than the size of the original experiment. Semifolding refers to adding half of a foldover fraction and is a technique that has been investigated in recent literature for regular two-level fractional factorial designs as an alternative to foldover. In this paper, a criterion for determining optimal semifoldover plans for two-level orthogonal factorial designs is proposed. Optimal plans are developed for selected 12, 16, 20, and 32-run designs and displayed for practical use. A hidden projection property of optimal semifoldovers of 12 and 20-run orthogonal arrays is also uncovered. General properties of semifoldover designs are obtained using indicator functions.	aliasing;characteristic function (convex analysis)	David J.

Recently, it was shown that there are infinitely many orthogonal polygons that folds into three boxes of different size. However, the smallest one that folds into three boxes consists of 532 unit squares. From the necessary condition, the smallest possible surface area that can fold into two boxes is 22, which admits to fold into two boxes of size (1times 1times 5) and (1times 2times 3). On the other hand, the smallest possible surface area for three different boxes is 46, which may admit to fold into three boxes of size (1times 1times 11), (1times 2times 7), and (1times 3times 5). For the area 22, it has been shown that there are 2,263 common developments of two boxes by exhaustive search. However, the area 46 is too huge for search. In this paper, we focus on the polygons of area 30, which is the second smallest area of two boxes that admits to fold into two boxes of size (1times 1times 7) and (1times 3times 3). Moreover, when we admit to fold along diagonal lines of rectangles of size (1times 2), the area may admit to fold into a box of size (sqrt{5}times sqrt{5}times sqrt{5}). That is, the area 30 is the smallest candidate area for folding three different boxes in this manner. We perform two algorithms. The first algorithm is based on ZDDs, zero-suppressed binary decision diagrams, and it computes in 10.2 days on a usual desktop computer. The second algorithm performs exhaustive search, however, straightforward implementation cannot be run even on a supercomputer since it causes memory overflow. Using a hybrid search of DFS and BFS, it completes its computation in 3 months on a supercomputer. As results, we obtain (1) 1,080 common developments of two boxes of size (1times 1times 7) and (1times 3times 3), and (2) 9 common developments of three boxes of size (1times 1times 7), (1times 3times 3), and (sqrt{5}times sqrt{5}times sqrt{5}).

In case of equality, the realization P of P is said to be of full rank. If there is a faithful realization P of P of dimension d = n + 1 or d = n (as P is finite or not), then P is said to be of nearly full rank. In previous papers, all the at most four-dimensional regular polytopes and apeirotopes of nearly full rank have been classified.

141658c1cda7643c174f140ed3158197a59ea50d	formal synthesis and validation of inhomogeneous thermostatically controlled loads		This work discusses the construction of a finite-space stochastic dynamical model as the aggregation of the continuous temperature dynamics of an inhomogeneous population of thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs). The temperature dynamics of a TCL is characterized by a differential equation in which the TCL status (ON, OFF) is controlled by a thresholding mechanism, and which displays inhomogeneity as its thermal resistance changes in time according to a Poisson process. In the aggregation procedure, each TCL model in the population is formally abstracted as a Markov chain, and the cross product of these Markov chains is lumped into its coarsest (exact) probabilistic bisimulation. Quite importantly, the abstraction procedure allows for the quantification of the induced error. Assuming that the TCLs explicitly depend on a control input, the contribution investigates the problem of population-level power reference tracking and load balancing. Furthermore, for the corresponding closed-loop control scheme we show how the worst case performance can be lower bounded statistically, thereby guaranteeing robustness versus power-tracking when the underlying assumption on the inhomogeneity term is relaxed.	aggregate data;best, worst and average case;control theory;load balancing (computing);markov chain;probabilistic bisimulation;tcl;thermal resistance;thresholding (image processing)	Sadegh Esmaeil Zadeh Soudjani;Sebastian Gerwinn;Christian Ellen;Martin Fränzle;Alessandro Abate	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-10696-0_6	mathematical optimization;simulation;computer science;mathematics;algorithm;statistics	Theory	43.62879289229839	5.559790343708702	36972

The set of arms take values in an N -dimensional space and belong to a bounded polyhedron described by finitely many linear inequalities. We provide a lower bound for the expected regret that scales as Ω(N log T ). We then provide a nearly optimal algorithm that alternates between exploration and exploitation intervals and show that its expected regret scales as O(N log (T )) for an arbitrary small > 0. We also present an algorithm than achieves the optimal regret when sub-Gaussian parameter of the noise is known. Our key insight is that for a polyhedron the optimal arm is robust to small perturbations in the reward function. Consequently, a greedily selected arm is guaranteed to be optimal when the estimation error falls below some suitable threshold. Our solution resolves a question posed by [1] that left open the possibility of efficient algorithms with asymptotic logarithmic regret bounds. We also show that the regret upper bounds hold with probability 1. Our numerical investigations show that while theoretical results are asymptotic the performance of our algorithms compares favorably to state-of-the-art algorithms in finite time as well.	asymptotically optimal algorithm;coat of arms;computer performance;exptime;greedy algorithm;in-phase and quadrature components;level of detail;linear function;linear inequality;linear programming;markov chain;mathematical optimization;multidimensional digital pre-distortion;numerical analysis;optimization problem;perturbation theory;polyhedral;polyhedron;regret (decision theory);reinforcement learning;social inequality	Manjesh Kumar Hanawal;Amir Leshem;Venkatesh Saligrama	2015	CoRR		mathematical optimization;combinatorics;machine learning;mathematics;statistics	ML	34.00119711295181	5.136443132238129	36983

We estimate the stationary probabilities of the states in the cluster using only transition information for these states, and bound the error of the estimate in terms of parameters measuring the quality of the cluster. Finally, we relate our results to searching in a hyperlinked environment, and provide supporting experimental results.	hyperlink;markov chain;stationary process	Nir Ailon;Steve Chien;Cynthia Dwork	2006		10.1007/11682462_9	stationary state;markov chain;computer science;examples of markov chains;calculus;in vitro;mathematics;hyperlink;transition state;markov chain mixing time;algorithm;statistics	ML	40.32016734669645	11.687003071887844	36993

Shimizu has given an inequality for warping degrees and crossing number of knot diagrams in the paper [5]. In this paper, we extend the notion of warping degrees and Shimizu’s inequality to nanowords. Moreover, to describe the condition for the equality, we introduce the new notion on nanowords, ”the alternating nanowards”, which corresponds to the alternating knot diagrams. keywords: knot diagrams, nanowords, warping degree Mathematics Subject Classification 2000: Primary 57M99; Secondary 68R15		Tomonori Fukunaga	2013	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.disc.2012.11.021	combinatorics;topology;knot invariant;knot;mathematics;geometry;skein relation	Theory	41.25762085000446	27.32385771522076	37040

We use this algorithm to perform online walks inside such an arrangement (i.e., compute all the faces that a curve, given in an online manner crosses), and to compute a level in an arrangement, both in an output-sensitive manner. The expected running time of the algorithm is O(λt+2(m + n) log n), where m is the number of intersections between the walk and the given arcs. No similarly efficient algorithm is known for the general case of arcs. For the case of lines and for certain restricted cases involving line segments, our algorithm improves the best known algorithm of [OvL81] by almost a logarithmic factor.	arcs (computing);chan's algorithm;computation;data structure;directed acyclic graph;heuristic;lu decomposition;online and offline;randomized algorithm;time complexity;monotone	Sariel Har-Peled	2000	SIAM J.

The problem class was introduced by Gritzmann et al. [3] twenty years ago. In their work and most other works on PSE problems, however, planarity of the output drawing was an essential requirement. Recent experiments on the readability of drawings [4] showed that polyline drawings with angles at edge crossings close to 90°. and a small number of bends per edge are just as readable as planar drawings. Motivated by these findings, Didimo et al. [2] recently introduced RAC drawings where pairs of crossing edges must form a right angle and, more generally, αAC drawings (for α∈ (0, 90°]) where the crossing angle must be at least α. As usual, edges may not overlap and may not go through vertices. We investigate the intersection of PSE and RAC/αAC.	vertex (geometry)	Martin Fink;Jan-Henrik Haunert;Tamara Mchedlidze;Joachim Spoerhase;Alexander Wolff	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-25878-7_43	combinatorics;data structure;computer science;mathematics;geometry;graph drawing;programming language;computational complexity theory;algorithm	Crypto	31.065948142387807	22.679072150627672	37067

While many methods have been proposed to solve regular MDPs with large state sets, there are few practical approaches for solving constrained MDPs with large action sets. In particular, we show that the continuous action sets can be replaced by their extreme points when the rewards are linear in the modulation. We also develop a tractable optimization formulation for concave reward functions and, surprisingly, also extend it to nonconcave reward functions by using their concave envelopes. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach on the problem of managing delinquencies in a portfolio of loans.	cobham's thesis;concave function;convex function;convex optimization;convex set;greedy algorithm;markov chain;markov decision process;mathematical optimization;modulation;optimization problem;polyhedron;risk aversion;scalability	Marek Petrik;Dharmashankar Subramanian;Janusz Marecki	2013	CoRR		mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;machine learning;mathematics	ML	35.826784204329435	4.648110319541945	37078

The set T is a strong transversal in H if T contains at least two vertices from every edge of H. The strong transversal number τs(H) of H is the minimum size of a strong transversal in H. We show that 7τs(H) ≤ 4n+ 2m, and we characterize the hypergraphs that achieve equality in this bound. In particular, we show that the Fano plane is the only connected 3-uniform hypergraph H of order n ≥ 6 and size m that achieves equality in this bound. A set S of vertices in a graph G is a double total dominating set of G if every vertex of G is adjacent to at least two vertices in S. The minimum cardinality of a double total dominating set of G is the double total domination number γ×2,t(G) of G. Let G be a connected graph of order n with minimum degree at least three. As an application of our hypergraph results, we show that γ×2,t(G) ≤ 6n/7 with equality if and only if G is the Heawood graph (equivalently, the incidence bipartite graph of the Fano plane). Further if G is not the Heawood graph, we show that γ×2,t(G) ≤ 11n/13, while if G is a cubic graph different from the Heawood graph, we show that γ×2,t(G) ≤ 5n/6, and this bound is sharp.	adjacency list;connectivity (graph theory);cubic function;dominating set;fano plane;graph theory;vertex (geometry)	Michael A.

041b57b3dc1fb60a54e7c1af156c909ae54f7d99	on pairs of lattice paths with a given number of intersections	lattice path	The purpose of this paper is to enumerate bijectively the number of ordered pairs of certain lattice paths: Consider paths in the integer lattice Z_Z that proceed with unit steps in either of the directions east or north. Let M k r, s be the set of ordered pairs of such paths that intersect exactly k times (i.e., that have k lattice points in common) in which both paths start at the origin (0, 0), the first path ends in (r, n&r) and the second path ends in (s, n&s). The intersection at the origin is not counted. Denote by M n, k r, s the cardinality of M n, k r, s : It is clear that M n, k r, s =M n, k s, r . A first formula for M n, k r, s was given in [1, Thm. 2]; the formula we want to prove here was given in [2, Thm. 5]. The definition for M k r, s in [1, 2] differs slightly from the one given above insofar as intersections at the endpoint (if r=s) are also not counted: This difference is irrelevant for the following theorem, but will simplify notation of the subsequent corollary.	communication endpoint;emoticon;enumerated type;ordered pair;relevance	Markus Fulmek	1997	J.

First, we formulate a collection of Markov chains on the graph ensemble and describe the characteristics of the associated mean hitting times on V. Then, we design a branch and bound optimisation technique for computing the subset of vertices A that exhibits the smallest hitting time cost across the multi-graph, given a constraint on the volume of A. The complexity of the branch and bound technique limits its application to medium-size graphs. Thus, we formulate a greedy optimisation method for computing a close approximation to the optimal subset at lower complexity, which can be implemented in a decentralised way, for further complexity reduction. We prove that the objective function under consideration is supermodular and monotonic, which guarantees near-optimal solutions for the greedy method. This is verified in our numerical experiments that compare its performance to that of the branch and bound technique, on smaller size graphs. The experiments also examine the hitting-time tradeoff across the multi-graph that our optimisation exhibits, governed by the sampling cost factors λj associated with each graph layer Gj. Relative to conventional community graph centrality methods for vertex selection, we demonstrate a substantially lower sampling (network) cost and higher data dissemination rate, on actual Facebook and Internet topology data. The generality of our framework allows for its application to information retrieval, from a collection of items represented by a multi-graph. Here, we demonstrate higher semantic consistency over state-of-the-art single-graph methods, on the popular	approximation;branch and bound;centrality;experiment;greedy algorithm;information retrieval;internet topology;loss function;markov chain;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;online community;optimization problem;reduction (complexity);sampling (signal processing);supermodular function	Jacob Chakareski	2014	Signal Processing	10.1016/j.sigpro.2014.03.018	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;feedback vertex set;computer science;machine learning;viral marketing;mathematics;algorithm;statistics	ML	34.19405813452947	6.320705955095874	37098

Such models arise frequently during the performance and reliability analysis of computer and telecommunication systems. IAD methods require the solution of a stochastic coupling matriz whose elements denote transition probabilities among blocks. The coupling matrices are often large and in NCD models necessarily have diagonal elements close to one and small og-diagonal elements. This makes their solution by either iterative or direct meihods rather difficult. In this paper we propose a modijcation of the coupling matrix that allows us to accurate and efficiently compute its stationary probability vector.	iterative method;markov chain;network computing devices;numerically controlled oscillator;stationary process	William J.

The closure of the set of the expansions of real numbers of [0, 1[ is a subshift of {a ∈ N | a < β}N, called the beta-shift. This dynamical system is characterized by the beta-expansion of 1; in particular, it is of finite type if and only if dβ(1) is finite; β is then called a simple beta-number. We first compute the beta-expansion of 1 for any cubic Pisot number. Next we show that cubic simple beta-numbers are Pisot numbers.	cubic function;dynamical system;emoticon	Frédérique Bassino	2002		10.1007/3-540-45995-2_17	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;dynamical system;mathematics;finite-state machine;real number;algebra	Theory	43.65530530291241	30.634693084931666	37161

However, when the number of sensors N is relatively large, the traditional PHD filter loses its computational efficiency, the complexity being exponential in N. On the other hand, the complexity of the full Bayes posterior is only linear in N, and this paper suggests an idea for its computation using Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods. The MS-PHD is then evaluated, and numerical examples show that it is possible to deal with a scenario where the number of sensors is very large while targets, appearing and disappearing, evolve in time.	computation;monte carlo method;numerical analysis;remote file sharing;sensor;time complexity	Paolo Braca;Stefano Maranò;Vincenzo Matta;Peter Willett	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2013.6638422	computer vision;econometrics;mathematical optimization;computer science;mathematics;sensor fusion;statistics;monte carlo method	Robotics	53.51771914800419	5.000079986174714	37164

By modeling the disturbance as a multi-channel auto-regressive (AR) process with a random cross-channel (spatial) covariance matrix, two knowledge-aided parametric adaptive detectors are developed within a Bayesian framework. The first knowledge-aided parametric detector is developed using an ad hoc two-step procedure for the estimation of the signal and disturbance parameters, which leads to a successive spatio-temporal whitening process. The second knowledge-aided parametric detector takes a joint approach for the estimation of the signal and disturbance parameters, which leads to a joint spatio-temporal whitening process. Both knowledge-aided parametric detectors are able to utilize prior knowledge about the spatial correlation through colored-loading that combines the sample covariance matrix with a prior covariance matrix. Computer simulation using various data sets, including the KASPPER dataset, show that the knowledge-aided parametric adaptive detectors yield improved detection performance over existing parametric solutions, especially in the case of limited data.	approximation;autoregressive model;coefficient;computer simulation;decorrelation;first-order predicate;hoc (programming language);ka band;sensor;space-time adaptive processing;the matrix;whitening transformation	Pu Wang;Hongbin Li;Braham Himed	2011	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2011.2168220	econometrics;bayesian probability;computer science;signal processing;pattern recognition;mathematics;autoregressive model;statistics	Vision	51.296077624699436	9.815155688497104	37185

In contrast to most neural approaches to combinatorial optimization based on quadratic energy cost function, the authors propose to use linear cost functions. As a result, the network complexity (number of neurons and the number of resistive interconnections) grows only linearly with problem size, and large-scale implementations become possible. The proposed approach is related to the linear programming network described by D.W. Tank and J.J. Hopfield (1985), which also uses a linear cost function for a simple optimization problem. It is shown how to map a difficult constraint-satisfaction problem onto a simple neural net in which the number of neural processors equals the number of subjobs (operations) and the number of interconnections grows linearly with the total number of operations. Simulations show that the authors' approach produces better solutions than existing neural approaches to job-shop scheduling, i.e. the traveling salesman problem-type Hopfield approach and integer linear programming approach of J.P.S. Foo and Y.

If A does not contain M , then A avoids M . Let ex(n,M) be the maximum number of ones in an n×n 0−1 matrix that avoids M , and let exk(m,M) be the maximum number of columns in a 0− 1 matrix with m rows that avoids M and has at least k ones in every column. A method for bounding ex(n,M) by using bounds on the maximum number of edges in bar visibility graphs was introduced in (R. Fulek, Discrete Mathematics 309, 2009). By using a similar method with bar visibility hypergraphs, we obtain linear bounds on the extremal functions of other forbidden 0− 1 matrices.	column (database);discrete mathematics;visibility graph	Jesse Geneson;Lilly Shen	2015	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.disc.2015.06.017	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics	Theory	31.12113931050575	27.592719506809136	37316

Five sensor models are considered: one obtained from classical estimation theory and four obtained from Bernoulli, Poisson, binomial, and mixture-of-binomial distributions. A systematic approach is presented for deriving information functions that represent the expected utility of future sensor measurements from mutual information, Rènyi divergence, Kullback-Leibler divergence, information potential, quadratic entropy, and the Cauchy-Schwarz distance. The resulting information-driven strategies are compared to direct-search, alert-confirm, task-driven (TS), and log-likelihood-ratio (LLR) search strategies. Extensive numerical simulations show that quadratic entropy typically leads to the most effective search strategy with respect to correct-classification rates. In the presence of prior information, the quadratic-entropy-driven strategy also displays the lowest rate of false alarms. However, when prior information is absent or very noisy, TS and LLR strategies achieve the lowest false-alarm rates for the Bernoulli, mixture-of-binomial, and classical sensor models.	binomial distribution;estimation theory;euler–bernoulli beam theory;expected utility hypothesis;kullback–leibler divergence;lucas–lehmer–riesel test;mutual information;numerical analysis;rule (guideline);rényi entropy;sensor;simulation	Guoxian Zhang;Silvia Ferrari;Chenghui Cai	2012	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)	10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2165336	random variable;mathematical optimization;information theory;sensor;machine learning;pattern recognition;mathematics;statistics	ML	47.449358243405364	6.706861608525696	37382
4216444936b0c43dec1f521ba2cccff1b3287502	conditional decoupling of quantum information		Insights from quantum information theory show that correlation measures based on quantum entropy are fundamental tools that reveal the entanglement structure of multipartite states. In that spirit, Groisman, Popescu, and Winter [Phys. Rev. A 72, 032317 (2005)PLRAAN1050-294710.1103/PhysRevA.72.032317] showed that the quantum mutual information I(A;B) quantifies the minimal rate of noise needed to erase the correlations in a bipartite state of quantum systems AB. Here, we investigate correlations in tripartite systems ABE. In particular, we are interested in the minimal rate of noise needed to apply to the systems AE in order to erase the correlations between A and B given the information in system E, in such a way that there is only negligible disturbance on the marginal BE. We present two such models of conditional decoupling, called deconstruction and conditional erasure cost of tripartite states ABE. Our main result is that both are equal to the conditional quantum mutual information I(A;B|E)-establishing it as an operational measure for tripartite quantum correlations.	attribute-based encryption;coupling (computer programming);information theory;marginal model;pictbridge;quantum entanglement;quantum information;quantum mutual information;quantum system;acute bacterial endocarditis (abe)	Mario Berta;Fernando G.

We call this property of analytic sets u-regularity. However, we show that the concept of uniform tree does not suffice to characterize dominating analytic sets in general. We construct a dominating closed set with the property that for no uniform tree whose branches are contained in the closed set, the set of these branches is dominating. We also show that from a Z.‘+l -rapid filter a non-u-regular ZI,‘-set can be constructed. Finally, we prove that C&&-regularity implies C&u-regularity.		Otmar Spinas	1994	Ann. Pure Appl.

A key tool is provided by a new labeling of the maximal chains of a poset of shuffles. This labeling and the structure of the orbits of maximal chains under the local action lead to combinatorial derivations of enumerative properties obtained originally by Greene. As a further consequence, a natural notion of type of shuffles emerges and the monoid of multiplicative functions on the poset of shuffles is described in terms of operations on power series. The main results concerning the flag symmetric function and the local action on the maximal chains of a poset of shuffles are obtained from new general results regarding chain labelings of posets.

We formally define different spatio-temporal criteria under which a trajectory can be homogeneous, including location, heading, speed, velocity, curvature, sinuosity, and curviness. We present a framework that allows us to segment any trajectory into a minimum number of segments under any of these criteria, or any combination of these criteria. In this framework, the segmentation problem can generally be solved in O(n log n) time, where n is the number of edges of the trajectory to be segmented.	course (navigation);lp-type problem;minimum bounding box;preprocessor;randomized algorithm;smallest-circle problem;torsion (gastropod);velocity (software development);vertex (geometry)	Maike Buchin;Anne Driemel;Marc J. van Kreveld;Vera Sacristán Adinolfi	2010		10.1145/1869790.1869821	computer vision;mathematical optimization;mathematics;geometry	ML	32.15019029138473	17.711295953721006	37433

We deduce that there exists a topology on n points having k open sets, for all k in an interval which is exponentially large in n.

An (n, q, r, s) book t-spread is a t-spread in PG(n, q) for which there exists an (n, q, r, s) book, such that the points of each page of this book and hence the points of the spine are partitioned by t-subspaces of the t-spread. We commence by showing that an (n, q, r, s) book t-spread exists if and only if the following three conditions hold: (i) (r − s)|(n − s), (ii) (t + 1)|(s + 1), (iii) (t + 1)|(r + 1). In general the number of different kinds of (n, q, r, s) book t-spreads is a tiny proportion of the number of different kinds of t-spreads in PG(n, q).

For the property p of edgeless graphs the p-chromatic number is just the usual chromatic number, whose value is known to be (1/2 + o(1))n/log2 n for almost every graph of order n.

As a special case, the Dowling transform sends the braid arrangement An to the Dowling arrangement. Using Zaslavsky's characterization of supersolvability of signed graphs, we show supersolvability of an arrangement is preserved under the Dowling transform.

Consider the following operations applied to D: (1) Insert (delete) a pair [x, y] into (from) D. (2) Given test integers x0, xl, and yl, among all pairs Ix, y] in D such that xO<-x<-xl and y<-yl, find a pair whose x is minimal (or maximal). (3) Given test integers x0 and xl, among all pairs Ix, y] in D such that xO<-x<-xl, find a pair whose y is minimal. (4) Given test integers x0, x 1, and y l, enumerate those pairs Ix, y] in D such that x0 <_-x _<-x and y _-< y 1. Using a new data structure that we call a priority search tree, of which two variants are introduced, operations (1), (2), and (3) can be implemented in O(log n) time, where n is the cardinality of D. Operation (4) is performed in at most O(log n+ s) time, where is the number of pairs enumerated. The priority search tree occupies O(n) space. Priority seach tree algorithms can be used effectively as subroutines in diverse applications. With them one can answer questions of intersection or containment in a dynamic set of linear intervals. They can be used in combination with a well-known plane-sweep technique, to implement off-line algorithms for enumerating all intersecting pairs of rectangles. Priority search trees can also be used to implement best-/first-fit storage allocation.	data structure;enumerated type;maximal set;online and offline;ordered pair;search tree;subroutine;sweep line algorithm	Edward M.

A connecting line of P is a line that passes through at least two of its points. A connecting line is called ordinary if it is incident on exactly two points of P. If the points of P are not collinear then such a line exists. In fact, there are Ω(n) such lines [8].

We explore efficient implementations of sample average approximation (SAA) methods to solve shortest path problems when the conditional value at risk and entropic risk measures are used and there is correlation present in the uncertain arc lengths. Our work explores the use of different decomposition techniques to achieve an efficient implementation of SAA methods for these nonlinear convex integer optimization problems. A computational study shows the effect of geometry, uncertainty correlation and variance, and risk measure parameters on efficiency and accuracy of the methods developed.

First, we give the TOA measurements model and deduce the Cramér-Rao lower bounds (CRLB). Then, we formulated the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem. We use the semidefinite programming (SDP) method to relax the nonconvex MLE problem into convex problem. It is shown that the original SDP algorithm can not provide a high-quality solution. We jointly add second-order-cone (SOC) constraints and penalty term to improve the tightness of the original SDP algorithm. Besides, we also consider the presence of receiver position errors, and develop the robust localization algorithm. Numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the localization performance of the proposed algorithms by comparing with the CRLB.	algorithm;convex optimization;major stationary source;numerical method;semidefinite programming;simulation;stationary process;time of arrival	Yanbin Zou;Qun Wan	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7952796	maximum likelihood;common emitter;robustness (computer science);mathematical optimization;time of arrival;semidefinite programming;convex optimization;symmetric matrix;cramér–rao bound;mathematics	Robotics	51.315865207726354	5.24525710541586	38450

In particular, conditions are given that ensure that (i) the kernel is located and (ii) the kernel is nontrivial. c © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. In the standard approach to a computational development of mathematics one uses classical logic, which allows “decisions”, such as whether or not a given real number equals 0; that cannot be made by a physical computer; in order to avoid such computationally illicit uses of the logic, one has to work with carefully speci8ed rules of computation such as those of recursive function theory. This approach has two disadvantages. First, at times it requires a lot of precise book-keeping which can distract one’s attention from the main mathematical issues under consideration and which can often make the mathematics rather hard to read. Secondly, the use of speci8ed rules of computation cuts down the possible interpretations of the results; for example, a result proved within the framework of recursive function theory cannot, in general, be interpreted outside that framework. In this paper we follow the alternative approach to computational mathematics, that of Bishop’s constructive mathematics, in which classical logic is replaced by intuitionistic logic. The latter logic automatically takes care of the problem of noncomputational “decisions”: for example, the proposition ∀x ∈ R (x = 0 ∨ x = 0) is not derivable in the axiomatic theory of the real line R with intuitionistic logic [3]. The change-of-logic approach has two advantages over the one described in the 8rst paragraph. First, it enables us to work, with any mathematical objects we choose (not just some special type of the so-called “constructive” objects), in the familiar, readable ∗ Corresponding author.

Ward / Theoretical Computer Science 284 (2002) 259–267 style of the analyst, algebraist, or geometer. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, by not requiring us to specify any rules of computation, it leads to a multiplicity of interpretations: a proof of a proposition P in constructive mathematics is automatically one of P in classical mathematics and in Brouwer’s intuitionistic mathematics, and is easily 8tted into the recursive model or the framework of Weihrauch’s type two eFectivity theory of computation. Indeed, we believe that constructive mathematics can be modelled in any reasonable framework for computable mathematics. For more information about constructive mathematics, the reader is referred to [1, 2, 7, 10]. A concise introduction to the main issues is found in an earlier article [3] in this journal. What we are going to look at in this paper is a couple of problems related to the kernel K ′ of a seminorm on a linear space X already provided with a norm. In doing this, we are not claiming that our results have any major applications. Our discussion does, however, illustrate a signi8cant feature of constructive mathematics: the appearance of problems that are classically vacuous but constructively nontrivial. With our 8rst problem, that of computing the distances from points of x to K ′; we are able to provide necessary and suHcient conditions for these computations to be possible. Our solution of the second problem, that of constructing points of K ′; depends on a result (Proposition 8) that is classically almost ridiculous and yet, constructively, requires a subtle and nowadays widely used application of the completeness of the ambient space; it also has some simple applications, notably in connection with supplements of linear subspaces of X: Let (X; ‖·‖) be a normed linear space, and ‖·‖′ a seminorm on X: We are interested in the kernel of ‖·‖′, K ′ = ker ‖·‖′ = {x ∈ H : ‖x‖′ = 0}: In particular, we seek • conditions which ensure that K ′ is located, in the sense that (x; K ′) = inf{‖x − y‖: ‖y‖′ = 0} exists; and • a criterion for testing to see whether K ′ is nontrivial. For convenience, we write (x; K ′)¡ to signify that ‖x − v‖¡ for some v∈K ′ even if we do not know that K ′ is located. Likewise, we write (xn; K ′)→ 0 to signify that there exists a sequence (vn) in K ′ such that limn→∞ ‖xn − vn‖= 0: We say that ‖·‖′ is • continuous if the identity mapping from (X; ‖·‖) to (X; ‖·‖′) is continuous; • open if the identity mapping from (X; ‖·‖) to (X; ‖·‖′) is an open mapping. It is easy to see that ‖·‖′ is continuous if and only if there exists c¿0 such that ‖·‖′6c‖·‖; and to prove the following lemma. Lemma 1. The following are equivalent conditions on the seminorm ‖·‖′; with kernel K ′; on (X; ‖·‖): D.S. Bridges, N.D. Ward / Theoretical Computer Science 284 (2002) 259–267 261 (i) ‖·‖′ is open. (ii) There exists r¿0 such that if ‖x‖′¡r; then (x; K ′)¡1; in which case if ¿0 and ‖x‖′¡r ; then (x; K ′)¡ : Classically, ‖·‖′ is an open seminorm if and only if the seminorm x → (x; K ′) is continuous with respect to ‖·‖′; if also ‖·‖′ is continuous relative to ‖·‖; then ‖·‖′ is equivalent to the seminorm x → (x; K ′): The only constructive problem with these remarks is that K ′ may not be located. However, as the next three results enable us to show, an open seminorm ‖·‖′ on a 8nite-dimensional space has located kernel and is equivalent to the seminorm x → (x; K ′): Lemma 2. Let (X; ‖·‖) be a >nite-dimensional normed space; and ‖·‖′ a seminorm on X: Then the mapping x → ‖x‖′ is uniformly continuous on X: Proof. We omit the routine computations. The next lemma reKects the fact that if x and y are orthogonal unit vectors in a Hilbert space, then the balls B(x; 1= √ 2) and B(y; 1= √ 2) are the largest disjoint balls with centres x and y: Note that vectors x1; : : : ; xn in a complex normed linear space are said to be linearly dependent if ∑n i=1 | ixi|¿0 for all scalars 1; : : : ; n with ∑n i=1 | i|¿0: This is, constructively, a stronger property than the usual classical one (to which, of course, it is classically equivalent). Lemma 3. Let a1; : : : ; ak be pairwise orthogonal unit vectors in a Hilbert space H; and let b1; : : : ; bk be vectors in H such that ‖ai − bi‖¡1 (16i6k): Then the vectors b1; : : : ; bk are linearly independent. Proof. Let 1; : : : ; k be complex numbers such that ∑k i=1 | i|¿0; we must show that ‖∑ki=1 ibi‖¿0: To this end, we may assume that ∑ki=1 | i| = 1: Since ∥∥∥ k ∑	axiomatic system;brouwer fixed-point theorem;care-of address;computability theory;computable function;computational mathematics;emoticon;hilbert space;human-readable medium;intuitionistic logic;personally identifiable information;recursion (computer science);seven bridges of königsberg;theoretical computer science;theory of computation	Douglas S.

These results can be considered as generalizations of the Heisenberg inequalities in the sense that they measure the mutual uncertainty of a random variable (or wave function) and its conjugated random variable (or Fourier transformed wave function) through their associated Renyi entropies with conjugated indexes. We consider here the more general case where the entropic indexes are not conjugated, in both cases where the state space is discrete and continuous: we discuss the existence of an uncertainty inequality depending on the location of the entropic indexes alpha and beta in the plane (alpha, beta). Our results explain and extend a recent study by Luis , where states with quantum fluctuations below the Gaussian case are discussed at the single point (2, 2).	entropic uncertainty;frequency analysis;pattern recognition;quantum fluctuation;quantum mechanics;rényi entropy;signal processing;social inequality;state space;time–frequency analysis;uncertainty principle	Steeve Zozor;Mariela Portesi	2008	2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595273	random variable;fourier transform;quantum fluctuation;mathematical analysis;calculus;entropic uncertainty;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	52.83351094205209	16.108032172932518	38525

It is shown that their central argument in establishing a well-defined semantical function, viz., completeness with respect to a metric obtained from the construction of their domain, is a special case of complete uniformities, which arise in a natural way from the study of closeness of ideals on domains. These uniformities are constructed and studied, and a general fixed-point theorem is derived for maps defined on these ideals.		Ernst-Erich Doberkat	1989	SIAM J.

We study parity constrained graph orientations under additional constraints. We consider two types of constraints for a multigraph G = (V,E): (1) an exact conflict constraint is an edge set C ⊆ E and a vertex v ∈ V such that C should not equal the set of incoming edges at v; (2) a subset conflict constraint is an edge set C ⊆ E and a vertex v ∈ V such that C should not be a subset of incoming edges at v. We show that it is NP-complete to decide whether G has an even orientation with exact or subset conflicts, for all conflict sets of size two or higher. We present efficient algorithms for computing parity constrained orientations with disjoint exact or subset conflict pairs.	algorithm;multigraph;np-completeness;np-hardness;strong orientation	Sarah Cannon;Mashhood Ishaque;Csaba D.

However, a graph representation does not capture the overall information about the data, as it implicitly takes into account only pairwise relations. The goal of this paper is to extend signal processing tools to signals defined over hypergraphs, which represent a formal framework to describe multi-way relations among the data. First, we suggest alternative ways to introduce a Fourier Transform (FT) for signals defined over hypergraphs and, in particular, for simplicial complexes. Then, building on the notion of Fourier Transform, we derive a sampling theorem aimed at identifying the minimum number of samples necessary to encode all information about band-limited hypergraph signals.	bandlimiting;encode;graph (abstract data type);graph (discrete mathematics);nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;sampling (signal processing);signal processing;simplicial complex	Sergio Barbarossa;Mikhail Tsitsvero	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2016.7472914	multidimensional signal processing;sampling;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;theoretical computer science;machine learning;discrete fourier transform;mathematics;simplicial complex	DB	53.48644569348023	19.18527883107558	38728

We survey several algorithmic ideas that have applications to the design and analysis of polynomial time approximation schemes for nearest neighbor search and clustering of high dimensional data.

Auslander and Yorke [1980] borrowed the strong, purely topological, version of sensitivity and introduced their definition of a chaotic map by associating it with transitivity, which is called Auslander–Yorke chaos. Moreover, if a map is Auslander–Yorke chaotic with dense periodic orbits, then it is called Devaney chaotic [Devaney, 1989]. In 1995, Cairns et al. [1995] introduced the definition of Devaney chaos for group actions, which directly generalized Devaney’s definition of a chaotic map. After that, the study of chaotic behavior of group actions has absorbed some authors’ interest (see, e.g. [Cairns & Kolganova, 1996; Naolekar & Sankaran, 2000; Wang et al., 2009]).

By introducing a few Steiner vertices, recent works find such a single-strip, and hence a linear ordering of edge-connected triangles of the entire triangulation. In this paper, we extend previous results [10] that exploit this linear ordering in efficient triangle-strip management for high-performance rendering. We present new algorithms to generate single-strip representations that follow different user defined constraints or preferences in the form of edge weights. These functional constraints are application dependent. For example, normal-based constraints can be used for efficient rendering after visibility culling, or spatial constraints for highly coherent vertex-caching. We highlight the flexibility of this approach by generating single-strips with preferences as arbitrary as the orientation of the edges. We also present a hierarchical single-strip management strategy for high-performance interactive 3D rendering.	3d rendering;algorithm;armadillo;coherence (physics);color;core data;cylinder-head-sector;geometry processing;graphics hardware;graphics processing unit;np-completeness;on-board data handling;paging;polygon mesh;strips;steiner tree problem;triangle mesh;triangle strip;video card	Pablo Diaz-Gutierrez;Anusheel Bhushan;Meenakshisundaram Gopi;Renato Pajarola	2006	The Visual Computer	10.1007/s00371-006-0018-2	hamiltonian path;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;np-complete;rendering;mathematics;geometry;total order;algorithm	Graphics	27.24675117827623	20.381267252899743	38818

We identify two families of graphs that have the maximum number of 1-factors over all graphs with the same number of vertices and edges: the almost regular graphs which are unions of complete regular bipartite graphs, and complete graphs with a matching removed. The first family is determined using Alon and Friedland’s bound. For the second family, we show that a graph transformation which is known to increase network reliability also increases the number of 1-factors. In fact, more is true: this graph transformation increases the number of k-factors for all k ≥ 1, and “in reverse” also shows that in general, threshold graphs have the fewest k-factors. We are then able to determine precisely which threshold graphs have the fewest 1-factors. We conjecture that the same graphs have the fewest k-factors for all k ≥ 2 as well.	degree (graph theory);graph (discrete mathematics);graph rewriting	Daniel Gross;Nathan Kahl;John T.

(Such a path is called non-reversing.) We investigate the trade-o between the number of added bridges and the resulting diameter.

4f7afa5be759cba5b8e2d2fe464f157fe3870bb6	stochastic pde projection on manifolds: assumed-density and galerkin filters		We review the manifold projection method for stochastic nonlinear filtering in a more general setting than in our previous paper in Geometric Science of Information 2013. We still use a Hilbert space structure on a space of probability densities to project the infinite dimensional stochastic partial differential equation for the optimal filter onto a finite dimensional exponential or mixture family, respectively, with two different metrics, the Hellinger distance and the L direct metric. This reduces the problem to finite dimensional stochastic differential equations. In this paper we summarize a previous equivalence result between Assumed Density Filters (ADF) and Hellinger/Exponential projection filters, and introduce a new equivalence between Galerkin method based filters and Direct metric/Mixture projection filters. This result allows us to give a rigorous geometric interpretation to ADF and Galerkin filters. We also discuss the different finite-dimensional filters obtained when projecting the stochastic partial differential equation for either the normalized (Kushner-Stratonovich) or a specific unnormalized (Zakai) density of the optimal filter. 1 The filtering problem in continuous time The state of a system X evolves over time according to some stochastic process driven by a noise W . We cannot observe the state directly but we make an imperfect measurement Y which is also perturbed stochastically by random noise V . In a diffusion setting this problem is formulated as dXt = ft(Xt) dt+ σt(Xt) dWt, X0, dYt = bt(Xt) dt+ dVt, Y0 = 0 . (1) In these equations the unobserved state process {Xt, t ≥ 0} takes values in R, the observation {Yt, t ≥ 0} takes values in R and the noise processes {Wt, t ≥ 0} and {Vt, t ≥ 0} are two Brownian motions. The nonlinear filtering problem consists in finding the conditional probability distribution πt of the state Xt given the observations up to time t and the prior distribution π0 for X0. Let us assume that X0, and the two Brownian motions are independent. Let us also assume that the covariance matrix for Vt is invertible. We can then assume without any further loss of generality that its covariance matrix is the identity. We introduce a variable at defined by at = σtσ T t . With these preliminaries, and a number of rather more technical conditions for which we refer to [9], one can show that πt satisfies the Kushner–Stratonovich equation. We further suppose that the measure πt is determined by a probability density pt. A formal calculation then gives the following Stratonovich calculus version of the optimal filter stochastic PDE (SPDE) for the evolution of p: dpt = Lt pt dt− 1 2 pt [|bt| − Ept{|bt|}] dt+ d ∑ k=1 pt [b k t − Ept{bt }] ◦ dY k t . (2) We use Stratonovich calculus because we need the formal chain rule to hold when identifying the projected evolution from the projected right hand side of the equation, as we hint below after Equation (7). Here L∗ is the formal adjoint of L – the so-called forward diffusion operator for X, where the backward diffusion operator is defined by:		John Armstrong;Damiano Brigo	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-25040-3_76	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;topology	ML	45.09327884885916	12.848986191834445	38973

Existing methods for optimizing this criterion considered only independent graspable regions on a given pair of edges. We propose an algorithm that takes nearby edges into consideration so that larger independent contact regions can be obtained. Our method takes the input polygons, computes graspable regions for each pair of edges, merge all adjacent regions together, and then find the best independent contact region inscribed in those regions. Two different criteria to define the best independent contact region are studied. The first criterion maximizes area of the axis-parallel rectangle in the configuration space, while the other criterion maximizes the smaller side's length of the rectangle. For a given object with n vertices, the first criterion can be optimized using the algorithm from Karen Daniels et al. in O(n2 log2 n) time, while the other criterion can be optimized using the algorithm from Evanthia Papadopoulou and D.

The data vector x=[x1,...,xN]T has a randomly generated sparsity pattern, where the i-th entry is non-zero with probability pi. Given knowledge of these probabilities, the decoder attempts to recover x based on M random noisy projections. Information-theoretic limits on the number of measurements needed to recover the support set of x perfectly are given, and it is shown that significantly fewer measurements can be used if the prior distribution is sufficiently non-uniform. Furthermore, extensions of Basis Pursuit, LASSO, and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit which exploit the prior information are presented. The improved performance of these methods over their standard counterparts is demonstrated using simulations.	automated theorem proving;basis pursuit;coefficient;compressed sensing;data point;detection theory;information theory;lasso;limewire;matching pursuit;openmp;procedural generation;simulation;sparse matrix	Jonathan Scarlett;Jamie S.

The existing techniques, however, do not guarantee the topological integrity of the extracted features because of their heuristic operations, which results in spurious features. Furthermore, there have been no algorithms for constructing topological graphs such as the surface network and the Reeb graph from the extracted peaks, pits, and passes. This paper presents new algorithms for extracting features and constructing the topological graphs using the features. Our algorithms enable us to extract correct terrain features; i.e., our method extracts the critical points that satisfy the Euler formula, which represents the topological invariant of smooth surfaces. This paper also provides an algorithm that converts the surface network to the Reeb graph for representing contour changes with respect to the height. The discrete elevation data used in this paper is a set of sample points on a terrain surface. Examples are presented to show that the algorithms also appeal to our visual cognition.	algorithm	Shigeo Takahashi;Tetsuya Ikeda;Yoshihisa Shinagawa;Tosiyasu L. Kunii;Minoru Ueda	1995	Comput. Graph.

a1a5fdbb97383e7722ffed985a2e9615928841c1	tropical vertex-disjoint cycles of a vertex-colored digraph: barter exchange with multiple items per agent		In a barter exchange market, agents bring items and seek to exchange their items with one another. Agents may agree to a k-way exchange involving a cycle of k agents. A barter exchange market can be represented by a digraph where the vertices represent items and the edges out of a vertex indicate the items that an agent is willing to accept in exchange for that item. It is known that the problem of finding a set of vertex-disjoint cycles with the maximum total number of vertices (MAX-SIZE-EXCHANGE) can be solved in polynomial time. We consider a barter exchange where each agent may bring multiple items, and items of the same agent are represented by vertices with the same color. A set of cycles is said to be tropical if for every color there is a cycle that contains a vertex of that color. We show that the problem of determining whether there exists a tropical set of vertex-disjoint cycles in a digraph (TROPICAL-EXCHANGE) is NP-complete and APX-hard. This is equivalent to determining whether it is possible to arrange an exchange of items among agents such that every agent trades away at least one item. TROPICALMAX-SIZE-EXCHANGE is a similar problem, where the goal is to find a set of vertex-disjoint cycles that contains the maximum number of vertices and also contains all of the colors in the graph. We show that this problem is likewise NP-complete and APX-hard. For the restricted case where there are at most two vertices of each color (corresponding to a restriction that each agent may bring at most two items), both problems remain NP-hard but are in APX. Finally, we consider MAX-SIZE-TROPICAL-EXCHANGE, where the set of cycles must primarily include as many colors as possible and secondarily include as many vertices as possible. We show that this problem is NP-hard.

The adjacency matrix of a graph is Robinsonian precisely when the graph is a unit interval graph, so that Robinsonian matrices form a matrix analogue of the class of unit interval graphs. Here we provide a structural characterization for Robinsonian matrices in terms of forbidden substructures, extending the notion of asteroidal triples to weighted graphs. This implies the known characterization of unit interval graphs and leads to an efficient algorithm for certifying that a matrix is not Robinsonian.	adjacency matrix;algorithm;column (database);stochastic matrix;monotone	Monique Laurent;Matteo Seminaroti;Shin-ichi Tanigawa	2017	Electr.

Since our goal is to model the evolution of dynamic logical networks, we work in a local model where we do not have direct access to the list of all vertices. Instead, we assume access to a global primitive that returns a random vertex, chosen uniformly from the whole vertex set. In this preliminary work, we focus on a simple model of uniform directed random graphs where all vertices have a fixed outdegree. We describe and analyze several algorithms for the maintenance task; the most elaborate of our algorithms are asymptotically optimal.

ff1d6c5ca69a76c19c1df48e185c041449a6bb87	a markowitz portfolio approach to options trading		In this paper, we study the problem of option portfolio design under the Markowitz mean-variance framework. We extend the common practice of a pure-stock portfolio and include options in the design. The options returns are modeled statistically with first- and second-order moments, enriching the conventional delta-gamma approximation. The naive mean-variance formulation allows for a zero-risk design that, in a practical scenario with parameter estimation errors, is totally misleading and leads to bad results. This zero-risk fallacy can be circumvented with a more realistic robust formulation. Transaction cost is also considered in the formulation for a proper practical design. We propose an efficient BSUM-M-based algorithm to solve the optimization problem. The proposed algorithm can perform as well as the off-the-shelf solvers but with a much lower computational time—up to one order of magnitude lower. Numerical results based on real data are conducted and the performance is presented in terms of Sharpe ratio, cumulative profit and loss, drawdown, overall return over turnover, value at risk, expected shortfall, and certainty equivalent.	algorithm;approximation;atari portfolio;computation;estimation theory;expected shortfall;mosek;mathematical optimization;microsoft office project portfolio server;numerical linear algebra;numerical method;optimization problem;simulation;stationary process;time complexity;value at risk	Licheng Zhao;Daniel Pérez Palomar	2018	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2018.2849733	robustness (computer science);value at risk;mathematical optimization;expected shortfall;order of magnitude;mathematics;estimation theory;sharpe ratio;optimization problem;portfolio	EDA	34.524550958672236	4.399519612902265	39367

Nevertheless, existing approaches have significant limitations. In many, the model order (number of sinusoids) is assumed known, and in most cases additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) is assumed. We present a method for jointly determining the model order and estimating the sinusoid parameters in white or colored noise. It uses the notch periodogram in an iterative detection and estimation algorithm. It uses an explicit detection test based on an estimate of the noise power density spectrum (PDS), which is obtained by smoothing the logarithm of the notch periodogram.	image resolution	Malcolm D.

It has been the basis of a systematic approach to multisensor, multitarget sensor management based on the posterior expected number of targets (PENT) objective function. The PHD filter has since been generalized to the cardinalized PHD (CPHD) filter, which propagates not only the PHD but also the full probability distribution on target number. The CPHD filter provides more accurate estimates of target number and target states. This paper shows how PENT-based objective functions can be naturally extended for use with the CPHD filter.	first-order predicate;kalman filter;loss function;optimization problem;sensor	Ronald P. S.

4e9d3fce845e27e1636c764e4836c2c940df9992	cinderella: computation, complexity, geometry	computational complexity;projective geometry	With Cinderella[12], you can easily create constructions, figures consisting of points, lines, circles, conics and other geometric elements, together with relations that describe the mathematical connections between the elements.[5] A standard example is a triangle, consisting of three points and three segments connecting each pair of points, and the altitudes in that triangle. The representation of the construction within the software makes it possible to move the vertices of the triangle (using the mouse) and get a new drawing for each position while the segments and the altitudes are updated accordingly. The mathematical core of Cinderella is based on projective geometry and Cayley-Klein geometries for maximal generality. All geometric constructions are designed to work in all meaningful situations and to have as few special cases as possible. At the same time it is possible to have different, simultaneous, interactive views of a geometric construction, like its 2D representation, a spherical projection, polarized versions of this or special views like the Poincaré disk for hyperbolic geometry. As soon as multi-valued geometric constructions, like the intersections of two circles or conics, or angle bisectors, are used, it is necessary to handle these with special care to avoid mathematical inconsistencies. Using a continuation technique on associated Riemann surfaces[4] Cinderella can guarantee – up to numerical errors – that continuous changes of parameters (i.e. free points) will cause continuous changes of the construction (within its realization space). As a consequence we do have a notion of “dynamic theorems”, consisting of a sequence of geometric construction steps and an element of the “fiber” over a given assignment of free values as a “germ.” The theory behind this gives rise to several mathematical questions that are interesting on their own,[6] but are not covered here. The intuitive user interface of Cinderella hides most of the mathematical details but exposes the mathematical content of geometry and makes a proper handling of geometry available not only for academic research, but also	complexity;computation;continuation;magma;map projection;maximal set;numerical analysis;user interface;vertex (graph theory)	Ulrich Kortenkamp	2002			discrete mathematics;combinatorics;projective geometry;conic section;continuation;map projection;computational complexity theory;vertex (geometry);riemann surface;geometry;mathematics;user interface	Theory	35.85574058669893	24.56962807271228	39824
6abe737ea1eade4c7310df3d257b9725820a580f	on the identifiability of the influence model for stochastic spatiotemporal spread processes		The influence model is a discrete-time stochastic model that succinctly captures the interactions of a network of Markov chains. The model produces a reduced-order representation of the stochastic network, and can be used to describe and tractably analyze probabilistic spatiotemporal spread dynamics, and hence has found broad usage in network applications such as social networks, traffic management, and failure cascades in power systems. This paper provides sufficient and necessary conditions for the identifiability of the influence model, and also develops estimators for the model structure through exploiting the model’s special properties. In addition, we analyze conditions for the identifiability of the partially observed influence model (POIM), for which not all of the sites can be measured. We develop an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm-based estimator to find the identifiable parameters in a POIM.

6ba018e0ec07c65223b91ccf2c330108d51197d8	sampling of band-limited signals with nonuniform sampling-time and bit-depth		To reproduce a band-limited continuous-time signal with optimal fidelity, usually it is sampled at the Nyquist sampling rate and then the sample values are quantized. In nonuniform sampling, the total number of samples are reduced in expense of adding some reconstruction complexity and assuming prior information about the signal. In this paper we propose nonuniform sampling-time with nonuniform bit resolution per sample (bit-depth) to reduce the total required bit budget (i.e. the number of samples timed the bit-depth) even further. This idea is based on the fact that the maximum local variation of band-limited signals is bounded in a given time horizon. Therefore, it is not necessary to allocate a fixed bit-depth proportional to the signal's dynamic range to each sample. Instead, we try to allocate adaptively only the needed number of bits to represent the next sample considering the physical characteristics of the signal. Both sampling and reconstruction entities can generate the next sampling-times and bit-depths locally by observing the current and previous samples only. We propose different techniques in our generalized sampling framework that share a common sampling architecture. Here we only consider ECG signals for evaluation purpose. Based on the simulation results, the total number of required bits to reconstruct the signal with negligible distortion can be reduced up to 88% without imposing any form of transform coding compression.	bandlimiting;continuous signal;distortion;dynamic range;entity;nonuniform sampling;nyquist rate;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;sampling (signal processing);simulation;transform coding	Mohammad Sadegh Mohammadi;Eryk Dutkiewicz;Qi Zhang	2014	2015 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7417106	signal reconstruction;coherent sampling;mathematical optimization;nonuniform sampling;dynamic range;oversampling;computer science;slice sampling;sensor;mathematics;sampling;bandwidth;statistics	Theory	51.00786386085595	16.67776198141189	39890

First we propose a syntax for denoting these graphs: in addition to parallel composition and series composition, it suffices to consider the neutral elements of those operations and a unary transpose operation. Then we give a finite equational presentation and we prove it complete: two terms from the syntax are congruent if and only if they denote the same graph.	biconnected component;biconnected graph;series-parallel graph;treewidth;unary operation	Enric Cosme-Llópez;Damien Pous	2017		10.4230/LIPIcs.MFCS.2017.76	1-planar graph;outerplanar graph;block graph;pathwidth;split graph;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;robertson–seymour theorem;cograph;graph product;clique-width;forbidden graph characterization;courcelle's theorem;clique-sum;mathematics;tree-depth;trémaux tree;modular decomposition;treewidth;partial k-tree;chordal graph;indifference graph;book embedding;algebra	Logic	31.723145885762733	31.023203951348197	39973

In this paper, we investigate and compare the matched, mismatched, and robust approaches to solve these problems in the context of the complex elliptically symmetric (CES) distributions. The matched approach is when the estimation and detection algorithms are tailored on the correct data distribution, whereas the mismatched approach refers to the case when the scatter matrix estimator and the decision rule are derived under a model assumption that is not correct. The robust approach aims at providing good estimation and detection performance, even if suboptimal, over a large set of possible data models, irrespective of the actual data distribution. Specifically, due to its central importance in both the statistical and engineering applications, we assume for the input data a complex t-distribution. We analyze scatter matrix estimators derived under the three different approaches and compare their mean square error (MSE) with the constrained Cramér-Rao bound (CCRB) and the constrained misspecified Cramér-Rao bound (CMCRB). In addition, the detection performance and false alarm rate (FAR) of the various detection algorithms are compared with that of the clairvoyant optimum detector.	algorithm;data model;mean squared error;signal processing	Stefano Fortunati;Fulvio Gini;Maria S.

The filter bank construction is performed by the Kepplerian temporospatial phase detection strategy which allows for the stroboscopic and synchronous cross sectional quadrature filtering of phase histories in local frequency encoding multichannels with respect to the rotating coordinate frame of reference. The Kepplerian strategy and the associated filter bank construction take place in symplectic affine planes which are immersed as coadjoint orbits of the Heisenberg two-step nilpotent Lie group G into the foliated three-dimensional real projective space P ( R×Lie(G) ) . Due to the factorization of transvections into affine dilations of opposite ratio, the Heisenberg group G under its natural sub-Riemannian metric acts on the line bundle realizing the projective space P ( R× Lie(G) ) . Its elliptic non-Euclidean geometry without absolute quadric, associated to the unitary dual Ĝ, governs the design of the coils inside the bore of the MRI scanner system. It determines the distributional reproducing kernel of the tracial read-out process of quantum holograms excited and coexisting in the MRI scanner system. Thus the pathway of this paper leads from Keppler’s approach to projective geometry to the Heisenberg approach to the sub-Riemannian geometry of quantum physics, and finally to the enormously appealing topic of ensemble quantum computing. 0 Received July 25, 1997.

This relationship equates partial derivatives of the (high-order) output correlation coefficient taken with respect to the input correlation coeflicients, to the output correlation coefficient of a new set of nonlinear devices bearing a simple derivative relation to the original set. Application is made to the interesting special cases of conventional crosscorrelation and autocorrelation functions, and Bussgang’s theorem is easily proved. As examples, the output autocorrelation functions are simply obtained for a hard limiter, linear detector, clipper, and smooth limiter.	autocorrelation;clipper;coefficient;correlation dimension;cross-correlation;gaussian process;input/output;limiter;nonlinear system;stochastic process	Robert Price	1958	IRE Trans.

In particular, we give optimal bounds for random partitioning schemes, as well as various types of embeddings. Using these geometric primitives, we present exponentially improved dependence on genus for a number of problems like approximate max-flow/min-cut theorems, approximations for uniform and nonuniform Sparsest Cut, treewidth approximation, Laplacian eigenvalue bounds, and Lipschitz extension theorems and related metric labeling problems.  We list here a sample of these improvements. All the following statements refer to graphs of genus <i>g</i>, unless otherwise noted.  • We show that such graphs admit an <i>O</i>(log <i>g</i>)-approximate multi-commodity max-flow/min-cut theorem for the case of uniform demands. This bound is optimal, and improves over the previous bound of <i>O</i>(<i>g</i>) [KPR93, FT03].

This dependence is optimal, and already yields a bound of <i>O</i>(log <i>g</i> + √log <i>n</i>), improving over the previous bound of <i>O</i>(√<i>g</i> log <i>n</i>) [KLMN04].  • We give an <i>O</i>(√log <i>g</i>)-approximation for the uniform Sparsest Cut, balanced vertex separator, and treewidth problems, improving over the previous bound of <i>O</i>(<i>g</i>) [FHL05].  • If a graph <i>G</i> has genus <i>g</i> and maximum degree <i>D</i>, we show that the <i>k</i>th Laplacian eigenvalue of <i>G</i> is (log <i>g</i>)<sup>2</sup> · <i>O</i>(<i>kgD/n</i>), improving over the previous bound of <i>g</i><sup>2</sup>·<i>O</i>(<i>kgD/n</i>) [KLPT09].

In the restricted case, where k is $O(n)$, line sweeping gives an optimal, $O(n\log n)$-time algorithm. For general k the parametric search technique of Megiddo is used to describe an $O(n(\log n)^2 )$-time algorithm. This is modified to produce a new, optimal $O(n\log n)$-time selection algorithm by incorporating an approximation idea.	algorithm;theil–sen estimator	Richard Cole;Jeffrey S. Salowe;William L.

In the block and hole structures (P,p), some edges are removed to make holes, and other edges are added to create rigid sub-structures called blocks. Previous work noted a combinatorial analogy in which blocks and holes played equivalent roles. In this paper, we connect stresses in such a structure (P,p) to first-order motions in a swapped structure (P,p), where holes become blocks and blocks become holes. When the initial structure is geometrically isostatic, this shows that the swapped structure is also geometrically isostatic, giving the strongest possible correspondence. We use a projective geometric presentation of the statics and the motions, to make the key underlying correspondences transparent.

A depth order of K, if exists, is a linear order < of the objects in K such that if K; L 2 K and K lies vertically below L then K < L. We present a new technique for computing depth orders, and apply it to several special classes of objects. Our results include: (i) If K is a set of n triangles whose xy-projections are alìfat', then a depth order for K can be computed in time O(n log 5 n). (ii) If K is a set of n convex and simply-shaped objects whose xy-projections are alìfat' and their sizes are within a constant ratio from one another, then a depth order for K can be computed in time O(nn 1=2 s (n) log 4 n), where s is the maximum number of intersections between the boundaries of the xy-projections of any pair of objects in K, and s (n) is the maximum length of (n; s) Davenport-Schinzel sequences.	first-order logic;map projection	Pankaj K.

In particular we show that, by maintaining a generalized Delaunay triangulation, the next edge to be added to the greedy triangulation can be found in O( n ) time. Furthermore, if the generalized Delaunay triangulation of a simple polygon could be computed in O( n ) time, our algorithm would compute the greedy triangulation in O( n  2 ) time.	greedy algorithm	Sally A.

This has been an intensively studied problem, not always with a solution, when the paths and cycles are also required to be plane. In this paper, we relax the constraint on the cycles and paths from being plane to being 1-plane, and deal with the same type of questions as those for the plane case, obtaining a remarkable variety of results. For point sets in general position, our main result is that it is always possible to obtain a 1-plane Hamiltonian alternating cycle. When the point set is in convex position, we prove that every Hamiltonian alternating cycle with minimum number of crossings is 1-plane, and provide O(n) and O(n) time algorithms for computing, respectively, Hamiltonian alternating cycles and paths with minimum number of crossings.	algorithm;crossing number (graph theory);hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);hamiltonian path	Mercè Claverol;Alfredo García Olaverri;Delia Garijo;Carlos Seara;Javier Tejel	2018	Comput.

For the maximum overlap problem, we observe that the dth root of the objective function is concave and present an algorithm that computes the optimal translation in expected time O(n3 log4 n). This method generalizes to higher dimensions d > 3 with expected running time O(nd+1− 3 d (logn)d+1). For the minimum convex hull problem, we show that the objective function is convex. The same method used for the maximum overlap problem can be applied to this problem and the optimal translation can be computed in the same time bound. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

7c3e845e36df5051b5c6e7178c2dab1ce28e08df	decomposition based hybrid metaheuristics	metaheuristics;decomposition techniques;hybrid optimization approaches;mixed integer programming;combinatorial optimization	Difficult combinatorial optimization problems coming from practice are nowadays often approached by hybrid metaheuristics that combine principles of classical metaheuristic techniques with advanced methods from fields like mathematical programming, dynamic programming, and constraint programming. If designed appropriately, such hybrids frequently outperform simpler “pure” approaches as they are able to exploit the underlying methods’ individual advantages and benefit from synergy. This article starts with a general review of design patterns for hybrid approaches that have been successful on many occasions. More complex practical problems frequently have some special structure that might be exploited. In the field of mixed integer linear programming, three decomposition techniques are particularly well known for taking advantage of special structures: Lagrangian decomposition, Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition (column generation), and Benders’ decomposition. It has been recognized that these concepts may also provide a very fruitful basis for effective hybrid metaheuristics. We review the basic principles of these decomposition techniques and discuss for each promising possibilities for combinations with metaheuristics. The approaches are illustrated with successful examples from literature.	approximation algorithm;column generation;combinatorial optimization;complex system;constraint programming;dantzig–wolfe decomposition;design pattern;dynamic programming;integer programming;linear programming;mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;norm (social);singular value decomposition;software testing;synergy	Günther R.

Without any additional restrictions, the set A need not contain a 3-term arithmetic progression whose common gap lies in S. What is then the weakest pseudorandomness assumption that if put on S would imply that A contains such a pattern? More precisely, what is the least integer k ≥ 2 for which there exists an η = η(α, σ) such that ‖S − σ‖Uk(G) ≤ η implies that A contains a non-trivial 3-term arithmetic progression with a common gap in S? Here, ‖·‖Uk(G) denotes the kth Gowers norm. For G = Zn we observe that k must be at least 3. However for G = F n p we show that k = 2 is sufficient, where here p is an odd prime and n is sufficiently large.	color gradient;pseudorandomness	Elad Aigner-Horev;Hiêp Hàn	2015	Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.endm.2015.06.063	arithmetic;combinatorics;mathematics;algebra	Theory	36.005297095978946	29.45819809860627	41049
1887b0633e390492f0843318f2115267c5c317b6	on the topology of the restricted delaunay triangulation and witness complex in higher dimensions	delaunay triangulation;computational geometry;higher dimensions	It is a well-known fact that, under mild sampling conditions, the restricted Delaunay triangulation provides good topological approximations of 1and 2-manifolds. We show that this is not the case for higher-dimensional manifolds, even under stronger sampling conditions. Specifically, it is not true that, for any compact closed submanifold M of Rn, and any sufficiently dense uniform sampling L of M , the Delaunay triangulation of L restricted to M is homeomorphic to M , or even homotopy equivalent to it. Besides, it is not true either that, for any sufficiently dense set W of witnesses, the witness complex of L relative to W contains or is contained in the restricted Delaunay triangulation of L. 1 Background and definitions All manifolds considered in this paper are compact closed submanifolds of Euclidean space R. The reach of a manifold M , or rch(M) for short, is the minimum distance of a point on M to the medial axis of M . All our manifolds have a positive reach. This is equivalent to saying that they are C1-continuous, and that their normal vector field satisfies a Lipschitz condition. Given a (finite or infinite) subset L of a manifold M , and a positive parameter ε, L is an ε-sample of M if every point of M is at Euclidean distance at most ε to L. In addition, L is ε-sparse if the pairwise Euclidean distances between the points of L are at least ε. Note that an ε-sparse sample of a compact set is always finite. Parameter ε is sometimes made adaptative in the literature [1], its value depending on the distance to the medial axis of the manifold. In this context, our ε-samples are called uniform ε-samples. For any finite set of points L ⊂ R, D(L) denotes the n-dimensional Delaunay triangulation of L, and D (L) its Delaunay triangulation restricted to a given subset M of R. By definition, D (L) is the nerve of the restriction of the Voronoi diagram of L to X. For any simplex σ of D(L), V(σ) stands for the face of the Voronoi diagram of L that is dual to σ. The following result comes from [1, 2]: Theorem 1.1 If M is a smooth curve in the plane or a smooth surface in 3-space, and if L is a finite ε-sample of M , with ε < 0.1 rch(M), then D (L) is homeomorphic to M . Let L, W be two subsets of R, such that L is finite. Given a point w ∈ W and a simplex σ = [p0, · · · , pk] with vertices in L, w is a witness of σ (or simply w witnesses σ) if p0, · · · , pk are among the k + 1 nearest neighbors of w in the Euclidean metric, that is: ∀p ∈ {p0, · · · , pk}, ∀q ∈ L \ {p0, · · · , pk}, ‖w − p‖ ≤ ‖w − q‖.

We extend this result to $$\mathfrak {R}^3$$ by computing constrained smallest enclosing sphere centered on a given sphere. We generalize the result for the case of points in $$\mathfrak {R}^d$$ where center of the minimum enclosing ball lies inside a given ball. We show that similar problem of minimum intersecting/stabbing ball for set of hyper planes in $$\mathfrak {R}^d$$ can also be solved using similar techniques. We also show how minimum intersecting disk with center constrained on a given disk can be computed to intersect a set of convex polygons. Lastly, we show that this technique is applicable when the center of minimum enclosing/intersecting ball lies in a convex region bounded by constant number of non-linear constraints with computability assumptions. We solve each of these problems in linear time complexity for fixed dimension.	time complexity	Sandip Das;Ayan Nandy;Swami Sarvottamananda	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-29221-2_11	combinatorics;topology;mathematics;geometry	ML	31.491064832438784	19.8102076784158	41300

Here we present an efficient algorithm for sampling a given star-shaped body. The complexity of the algorithm grows polynomially in the dimension and inverse polynomi-ally in the fraction of the volume taken up by the kernel of the star-shaped body. The analysis is based on a new isoperimetric inequality. Our main technical contribution is a tool for proving such inequalities when the domain is not convex. As a consequence, we obtain a polynomial algorithm for computing the volume of such a set as well. In contrast, linear optimization over star-shaped sets is NP-hard.	algorithm;convex function;gibbs sampling;isoperimetric inequality;linear programming;mathematical optimization;np-hardness;polynomial;sampling (signal processing);social inequality	Karthekeyan Chandrasekaran;Daniel Dadush;Santosh Vempala	2010		10.1137/1.9781611973075.133	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mixed volume;convex body;criss-cross algorithm;linear matrix inequality;linear programming;cryptography;mathematics;geometry;isoperimetric inequality;isoperimetric dimension	Theory	27.2834766687223	17.7458576065889	41388

This imply in particular that the existence of non-abelian CSAgroup of finite Morley rank is equivalent to the existence of a simple bad group all whose definable proper subgroups are abelian. We give a new proof of a result of E. Mustafin and B. Poizat [8] which states that a superstable model of the universal theory of non-abelian free groups is abelian. We deduce also that a superstable torsion-free hyperbolic group is cyclic.

A supermartingale numéraire (resp. local martingale numéraire) is a wealth process whose reciprocal is a supermartingale deflator (resp. local martingale deflator). It has been established in previous works that absence of arbitrage of the first kind (NA1) is equivalent to the existence of the (unique) supermartingale numéraire, and further equivalent to the existence of a strictly positive local martingale deflator; however, under NA1, a local martingale numéraire may fail to exist. In this work, we establish that under NA1, a supermartingale numéraire under the original probability P becomes a local martingale numéraire for equivalent probabilities arbitrarily close to P in the total variation distance.	risk-neutral measure;total variation diminishing	Yuri Kabanov;Constantinos Kardaras;Shiqi Song	2016	Finance and Stochastics	10.1007/s00780-016-0310-6	financial economics;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;fundamental theorem of asset pricing;economics;finance;mathematics;martingale difference sequence;local martingale;arbitrage;numéraire	Vision	44.41299977030828	11.058530502989726	41481

The minimum number of edges required to guarantee that an arbitrary graph, or a bipartite graph, has a star forest of size n is determined. Sharp lower bounds on the size of a largest star forest are also determined. For bipartite graphs, these are used to obtain an upper bound on the domination number in terms of the number of vertices and edges in the graph, which is an improvement on a bound of Vizing. In turn, the results on bipartite graphs are used to determine the minimum number of lattice points required so that there exists a subset of n lattice points, no three of which form a right triangle with legs parallel to the coordinate axes.	a* search algorithm;dominating set;file spanning;star height;vadim g. vizing	Sheila Ferneyhough;Ruth Haas;Denis Hanson;Gary MacGillivray	2002	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/S0012-365X(01)00046-2	graph power;edge-transitive graph;complete bipartite graph;combinatorics;arboricity;discrete mathematics;triangle-free graph;independent set;topology;bipartite graph;dominating set;star;forbidden graph characterization;foster graph;cycle graph;graph factorization;mathematics;distance-hereditary graph;tree-depth;upper and lower bounds;domatic number;bound graph;biregular graph;line graph;matching	Theory	28.24174058977879	28.873636730718392	41592

To prove this statement, we construct two new infinite families of minimal non-orientable matroids of rank 3. Furthermore we also investigate representability of the two infinite families.	matroid	Hidefumi Hiraishi;Sonoko Moriyama	2015	Eur. J.

The sequence {Tn} is shown to be a sequence of “snapshots” of a Crump–Mode branching process. This connection and a theorem by Kingman are used to show quickly that the height of Tn is asymptotic, with probability one, to c log n. In particular, c = e = 2.718 … for the uniform recursive tree, and c = (2γ)−1, where γe1+γ = 1, for the ordered recursive tree. An analogous reduction provides a short proof of Devroye's limit law for the height of a random m‐ary search tree.

84114160c75aa6614d38367d2d13bcb6c958a30a	calibration of directional mutual coupling for antenna arrays		Abstract Mutual coupling (MC) is one of the major error sources in array signal processing. The previous methods mostly assume that the MC is direction-independent and it is modeled by a single MC matrix. However, this is not valid in a practical scenario where the effect of MC differs for the source signals incoming from different directions. In this paper, calibration of directional MC is considered for direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation problem. An alternating and sectorized parameter estimation (ASPE) algorithm is proposed where the estimates of the source DOA angles and the MC coefficients corresponding to each source direction are found iteratively. A unified approach is introduced so that the proposed algorithm can effectively work for different array geometries regardless of the array geometry and the corresponding MC matrix model. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by several experiments and it is compared with the conventional calibration techniques as well as the Cramer–Rao lower Bound which is derived for the considered problem. It is shown that the proposed method effectively finds the unknown source and coupling parameters and it has superior performance as compared to the conventional calibration techniques.		Ahmet M.

One particular motivation behind unconventional computation is the desire efficiently to solve classically difficult problems—we recall chemical-computer attempts at solving NP -complete problems such as the Travelling Salesperson Problem—, with computational complexity theory offering the criteria for judging this efficiency. However, care must be taken here; conventional (Turing-machine-style) complexity analysis is not always appropriate for unconventional computers: new, non-standard computational resources, with correspondingly new complexity measures, are often required. Accordingly, we discuss in the present paper various resources beyond merely time and space (and, indeed, discuss various interpretations of the term ‘resource’ itself), advocating such resources’ consideration when analysing the complexity of unconventional computers. We hope that this acts as a useful starting point for practitioners of unconventional computing and computational complexity.	analysis of algorithms;chemical computer;computation;computational complexity theory;computational model;computational resource;expectation propagation;logic gate;travelling salesman problem;turing machine;unconventional computing	Ed Blakey	2010	Natural Computing	10.1007/s11047-010-9226-9	mathematical optimization;computer science;artificial intelligence;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	29.568250156310423	5.81486020761956	41830

59ac48a10278b722a7d7025637ff3bc47f3fbf70	spectral analysis of attractors in random boolean network models		Circuits and loops in graph systems can be used to model the attractors in gene-regulatory networks. The number of such attractors grows very rapidly with network size and even for small nets the properties of the set of attractors, including their length distribution, are not well understood. This paper presents a Fourier spectral analysis of attractor lengths in a set of networks using Kauffman’s NK random boolean network model. This allows a systematic study of the bulkaverage properties of the attractor distribution for different network connectivities without resorting to computationally expensive exact enumeration techniques. Networks with nodes of fixed degree and with distributions of different degree are studied. The length distribution of attractors flattens out above a connectivity of K = 2. It is hypothesised that discontinuities in the distribution are due to partial unreachability that arise even in single component nets at low connectivities.	analysis of algorithms;boolean network;gene regulatory network;network model	Kenneth A.

However, it is possible to draw such a conclusion for the adaptive array pmbkm in which direction of arrival and signal magnitude are being estimated. prools of w-asymptotic efficiency (which comes with a convergence-of-moments condition) and strong consistency (almost-sure convergence) of the ML estimator are given. Strong coosistency is also proved for a popular quasi-ML estimator.	direction of arrival;sensor;strong consistency	Gerald R. Benitz	1993	IEEE Trans.

ee3ede18e04d36a0f65e508e0a3aa60f30b6a2a2	minimum supports of eigenfunctions of hamming graphs		Many combinatorial configurations (for example, perfect codes, latin squares and hypercubes, combinatorial designs and their q-ary generalizations — subspace designs) can be defined as an eigenfunction on a graph with some discrete restrictions. The study of these configurations often leads to the question about the minimum possible difference between two configurations from the same class (it is often related with bounds of the number of different configurations; for example, see [1–5]). Since the symmetric difference of these two configurations is also an eigenfunction, this question is directly related to the minimum cardinality of the support (the set of nonzero) of an eigenfunction with given eigenvalue. This paper is devoted to the problem of finding the minimum cardinality of the support of eigenfunctions in the Hamming graphs H(n, q). Currently, this problem is solved only for q = 2 (see [4]). In [6] Vorob’ev and Krotov proved the lower bound on the cardinality of the support of an eigenfunction of the Hamming graph. In this paper we find the minimum cardinality of the support of eigenfunctions in the Hamming graphs with eigenvalue n(q − 1) − q and describe the set of functions with the minimum cardinality of the support. It is well-known that the set of eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of H(n, q) is {λm = n(q−1)−qm | m = 0, 1, . . . , n}. The support of f is denoted by S(f). The set of vertices x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn) of the graph H(n, q) such that xi = k is denoted by Tk(i, n). We prove the following theorem: Theorem.

We study the relation between the topology of an almost-Riemannian structure on a compact oriented surface and the total curvature. In particular, we analyse the case in which there exist tangency points, i.e. points where two generators of the distribution and their Lie bracket are linearly dependent. The main result of the paper is a characterization of trivializable oriented almost-Riemannian structures on compact oriented surfaces in terms of the topological invariants of the structure. Moreover, we present a Gauss- Bonnet formula for almost-Riemannian structures with tangency points.	existential quantification	Andrei A. Agrachev;Ugo V.

In this framework, L -left (resp.

In addition, the relationship between an L -ordered semigroup and an L -topological semigroup is studied. As a consequence, an isomorphism between the category of L -ordered semigroups and the category of L -topological semigroups with the topologies being L - T 0 and Alexandrov is obtained.

The two kinds of presentation share many traits but also display profound differences on issues ranging from decidability to modeling convenience and physical implementability. Following a conjecture by Toffoli and Margolus, it had been proved by Kari that any invertible CA, at least up to two dimensions, can be rewritten as an isomorphic LG. But until now it was not knownwhether this is possible in general for noninvertible CA—which comprise ‘‘almost all’’ CA and represent the bulk of examples in theory and applications. Even circumstantial evidence – whether in favor or against – was lacking. Here, for noninvertible CA, (a) we prove that an LG presentation is out of the question for the vanishingly small class of surjective ones.We then turn our attention to all the rest – noninvertible and nonsurjective – which comprise all the typical ones, including Conway’s ‘Game of Life’. For these (b) we prove by explicit construction that all the one-dimensional ones are representable as LG, and (c)wepresent andmotivate the conjecture that this result extends to any number of dimensions. The tradeoff between dissipation rate and structural complexity implied by the above results have compelling implications for the thermodynamics of computation at a microscopic scale. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we consider the problem of efficient construction of sparse spanners of disk (ball) graphs with support for fast distance queries. These problems are motivated by issues arising from topology control and routing in wireless networks. We present the first algorithm for constructing spanners of ball graphs. For a ball graph in R, we construct a (1+ǫ)-spanner with O(nǫ) edges in O(nǫ log S) expected time, using an efficient partitioning of the space into hypercubes and solving intersection problems. Here l = 1 − 1/(⌊k/2⌋ + 2), δ is any positive constant, and S is the ratio between the largest and smallest radius. For the special case where all the balls have the same radius, we show that the spanner construction has complexity almost equivalent to the construction of a Euclidean minimum spanning tree. Previously known constructions of spanners of unit ball graphs have time complexity much closer to n. Additionally, these spanners have a small vertex separator (hereditary), which is then exploited for fast answering of distance queries. The results on geometric graph separators might be of independent interest.	algorithm;average-case complexity;ball project;file spanning;geometric graph theory;graph (discrete mathematics);minimum spanning tree;routing;sparse matrix;time complexity;topology control;vertex separator	Martin Fürer;Shiva Prasad Kasiviswanathan	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-73951-7_28	1-planar graph;block graph;theta graph;pathwidth;euclidean minimum spanning tree;unit disk graph;split graph;combinatorics;geometric graph theory;discrete mathematics;interval graph;topology;computational geometry;wireless network;mathematics;geometry;intersection number;beta skeleton;chordal graph;indifference graph;unit sphere;intersection graph;line graph;planar graph	Theory	27.797196911310028	21.356645641752596	42330
d7335f1d90632780712aa144ca45aafd98c6dee8	on the hyperbolicity of small-world and treelike random graphs		Hyperbolicity is a property of a graph that may be viewed as a “soft” version of a tree, and recent empirical and theoretical work has suggested that many graphs arising in Internet and related data applications have hyperbolic properties. Here we consider Gromov’s notion of δ-hyperbolicity and establish several positive and negative results for small-world and treelike random graph models. First, we study the hyperbolicity of the class of Kleinberg small-world random graphs KSW(n, d, γ), where n is the number of vertices in the graph, d is the dimension of the underlying base grid B, and γ is the small-world parameter such that each node u in the graph connects to another node v in the graph with probability proportional to 1/dB (u, v) , with dB (u, v) the grid distance from u to v in the base grid B. We show that when γ = d, the parameter value allowing efficient decentralized routing in Kleinberg’s small-world network,the hyperbolic δ is Ω ( (log n)1/ (1 .5(d+1)+ ε ) ) with probability 1 − o(1) for every ε > 0 independent of n. We see that hyperbolicity is not significantly improved in relation to graph diameter even when the long-range connections greatly improve decentralized navigation. We also show that for other values of γ, the hyperbolic δ is very close to the graph diameter, indicating poor hyperbolicity in these graphs as well. Next we study a class of treelike graphs called ringed trees that have constant hyperbolicity. We show that adding random links among the leaves in a manner similar to the small-world graph constructions may easily destroy the hyperbolicity of the graphs, except for a class of random edges added using an exponentially decaying probability function based on the ring distance among the leaves.

In a related recent work, a simulation based algorithm for estimating performance measures associated with a Markov chain conditioned on a rare event has been developed. We extend ideas from this work and develop an adaptive algorithm for obtaining, online, optimal control policies conditioned on a rare event. Our algorithm uses three timescales or step-size schedules. On the slowest timescale, a gradient search algorithm for policy updates that is based on one-simulation simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) type estimates is used. Deterministic perturbation sequences obtained from appropriate normalized Hadamard matrices are used here. The fast timescale recursions compute the conditional transition probabilities of an associated chain by obtaining solutions to the multiplicative Poisson equation (for a given policy estimate). Further, the risk parameter associated with the value function for a given policy estimate is updated on a timescale that lies in between the two scales above. We briefly sketch the convergence analysis of our algorithm and present a numerical application in the setting of routing multiple flows in communication networks.	adaptive algorithm;approximation algorithm;bellman equation;computational complexity theory;ergodic theory;ergodicity;experiment;extreme value theory;gradient;hadamard transform;hessian;importance sampling;markov chain;mathematical optimization;newton;numerical analysis;optimal control;rare events;recursion;risk assessment;routing;sampling (signal processing);scalability;schedule (computer science);search algorithm;simulation;simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation;sparse matrix;telecommunications network	Shalabh Bhatnagar;Vivek S.

A set S of n line segments is given. The objective is to find the minimum number of axis-parallel unit squares which cover at least one end-point of each segment. We may have different variations of this problem depending on the orientation and length of the input segments. We prove some of these problems to be NP-hard, and give constant factor approximation algorithms for those problems. For some variations, we have polynomial time exact algorithms. Further, we show that our problems have connections with the problems studied by Arkin et al. [2] on conflictfree covering problem.

98856a24affbe22928951cb6b31f973d540c9ee5	geometric science of information	shape optimization;free forms;shapes representation	Information geometry emerged from the study of the geometrical structure of a manifold of probability distributions under the criterion of invariance. It defines a Riemannian metric uniquely, which is the Fisher information metric. Moreover, a family of dually coupled affine connections are introduced. Mathematically, this is a study of a triple (M, g, T ), where M is a manifold, g is a Riemannian metric, and T is a third-order symmetric tensor. Information geometry has been applied not only to statistical inferences but also to various fields of information sciences where probability plays an important role. Many important families of probability distributions are dually flat Riemannian manifolds. A dually flat manifold possesses a beautiful structure: It has two mutually coupled flat affine connections and two convex functions connected by the Legendre transformation. It has a canonical divergence, from which all the geometrical structure is derived. The KL-divergence in probability distributions is automatically derived from the invariant flat nature. Moreover, the generalized Pythagorean and geodesic projection theorems hold. Conversely, we can define a dually flat Riemannian structure from a convex function. This is derived through the Legendre transformation and Bregman divergence connected with a convex function. Therefore, information geometry is applicable to convex analysis, even when it is not connected with probability distributions. This widens the applicability of information geometry to convex analysis, machine learning, computer vision, Tsallis entropy, economics, and game theory. The present talk summarizes theoretical constituents of information geometry and surveys a wide range of its applications.	bregman divergence;computer vision;convex analysis;convex function;fisher information;game theory;information geometry;information science;kullback–leibler divergence;legendre transformation;machine learning;tsallis entropy	Frank Nielsen;Frédéric Barbaresco	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-40020-9	mathematical optimization;topology;shape optimization;shape analysis;mathematics;geometry	Vision	44.51457637983027	15.226965180144187	42703

We consider lattice walks in R confined to the region 0 < x1 < x2... < xk with fixed (but arbitrary) starting and end points. The walks are required to be ”reflectable”, that is, we assume that the number of paths can be counted using the reflection principle. The main result is an asymptotic formula for the total number of walks of length n for a general class of walks as n tends to infinity. As applications, we find the asymptotics for the number of k-non-crossing tangled diagrams on the set {1, 2, ..., n} as n tends to infinity, the asymptotics for the number of k-vicious walkers subject to a wall restriction in the random turns model, and we re-derive known asymptotics for the number of k-vicious walkers subject to a wall restriction in the lock step model.	dvd region code;diagram	Thomas Feierl	2014	Random Struct.

f769dd147c5e0aa5f77a0be21ea9b3ff8686ddf6	on chordal proper circular arc graphs	circular arc graph	Wegner proved that a chordal graph is a proper interval graph if and only if it is claw-free, net-free and tent-free. We observe that in fact the characterization can be refined to say that a chordal graph is a proper interval graph if and only if it is claw-free, net-free and not a multiple of the tent. This observation implies that a chordal graph is a proper circular arc graph if and only if it is claw-free and net-free. A further implication of this result is that a chordal graph can be oriented as a local tournament - an oriented raph in which the predecessors as well as the successors of any vertex induce a tournament - if and only if it is claw-free and net-free.

This result is a hypergraphic extension of a recent theorem in [GKLM] saying that the line graphs of bipartite graphs are neighbourhood-perfect. The note contains also a graphical extension of the same theorem: the characterization of all graphs with neighbourhood-perfect line graph.

This task is equivalent to tree reconstruction from a set of partial X–splits (bipartitions of subsets of X). In this paper, we define and analyse a “closure” operation for partial X–splits that was informally proposed by Meacham [5]. In particular, we establish a sufficient condition for such an operation to reconstruct a tree when there is essentially only one tree that displays the partial X–splits. This result exploits a recent combinatorial result from [2].	phylogenetic tree;phylogenetics;tree (data structure)	Charles Semple;Mike A.

ac2fe555bc96ac51e978483298d8fadcfe7324dd	a combinatorial algorithm to establish a fair border	fair border;combinatorial algorithm	Since it was introduced by Steinhaus [4], the problem of dividing an object (often thought of as a cake) fairly among n people has generated a number of interesting solutions and variations. There are, for example, different possible definitions for the concept of fairness. We will use the original and most common definition, namely that each person receives at least a 1/n share according to his own evaluation. Also, the idea of what constitutes an allowable cut can vary. The first type considered was where at each stage one person is instructed to cut a piece into two parts of specified sizes according to his own evaluation only. The 'you cut in half and I choose' solution for n = 2 and its generalizations are of this type. The solution desired under this interpretation is a discrete type of algorithm (usually recursive), which specifies at each stage who cuts which piece and what the sizes of resulting parts should be. This is the interpretation of an allowable cut that we will use. An example of a more powerful notion of a cut is exemplified by the well known 'moving knife' solution. Here, a knife moves continuously across the cake, all of the participants continuously evaluate the two parts as the knife moves, and are instructed to say 'stop' when one part first reaches a specified size. Since this type of cut allows all participants to simultaneously judge sizes it may not be considered to be a finite algorithm by everyone [6]. Also, since it is a more powerful interpretation of an allowable cut, it often admits much simpler algorithms, at least in terms of the number of cuts. Also, in some of the more difficult variations, solutions of an existence type are sometimes given [2, 5, 6]. The solutions are now more measure theoretic, rather than combinatorial.	algorithm;combinatorial optimization;cut (graph theory);fairness measure;recursion;theory;whole earth 'lectronic link	William A.

In 2010, Suzuki generalized heterochromatic graphs to f chromatic graphs, where any color c appears at most f(c). Moreover, he presented a necessary and sufficient condition for graphs to have an f -chromatic spanning forest with exactly w components. In this paper, using this necessary and sufficient condition, we generalize the Brualdi-Hollingsworth theorem above.

The quadratic functions are often applied in the inventory management, portfolio selection, engineering design, molecular study, and economics, etc. Fuzzy relation inequalities (FRI) are important elements of fuzzy mathematics, and they have recently been widely applied in the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation and cybernetics. In view of the importance of quadratic functions and FRI, we present a fuzzy relation quadratic programming model with a quadratic objective function subject to the max-product fuzzy relation inequality constraints. Some sufficient conditions are presented to determine its optimal solution in terms of the maximum solution or the minimal solutions of its feasible domain. Also, some simplification operations have been given to accelerate the resolution of the problem by removing the components having no effect on the solution process. The simplified problem can be converted into a traditional quadratic programming problem. An algorithm is also proposed to solve it. Finally, some numerical examples are given to illustrate the steps of the algorithm.	quadratic programming;social inequality	Ali Abbasi Molai	2012	Computers & Industrial Engineering	10.1016/j.cie.2011.09.012	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;quadratic residuosity problem;second-order cone programming;fuzzy number;quadratically constrained quadratic program;mathematics;sequential quadratic programming;active set method;quadratic programming;fuzzy set operations	SE	26.678427268505967	9.798459802846878	42963

For example, it is known that (non-causal) symmetric median filters preserve arbitrary monotone sequences. Behavioral characterizations ask converse questions like: what can be said about the class of all filters F that preserve monotonicity? The primary point of this paper is to illustrate that category theory provides a natural framework for examining such questions.	category theory;causal filter;digital filter;nonlinear system;monotone	Ronald K.

Such a formalization increases the reliability of textbook proofs whose details and particular cases are often overlooked and left to the reader as exercises. Projective plane geometry is described through two different axiom systems which are formally proved equivalent. Usual properties such as decidability of equality of points (and lines) are then proved in a constructive way. The duality principle as well as formal models of projective plane geometry are then studied and implemented in Coq. Finally, we formally prove in Coq that Desargues’ property is independent of the axioms of projective plane geometry.	axiomatic system;coq (software);proof assistant	Nicolas Magaud;Julien Narboux;Pascal Schreck	2008		10.1007/978-3-642-21046-4_7	projective plane;line at infinity;projective line;homogeneous coordinates;fano plane;projective space;duality;projective geometry;discrete mathematics;duality;topology;homography;affine plane;blocking set;real projective plane;non-desarguesian plane;collineation;mathematics;geometry;proof assistant;complex projective space;projective differential geometry;correlation;real projective line;pencil;line coordinates	Theory	40.12712968513808	24.66620834101685	43295

The technique is introduced in Alani et al (2001) and examples of its use are given in Arampatzis et al (2006) and Tatalovich (2005). The techniques are attractive because they will typically require less storage and less computing power to generate representations of regions and answer related queries of the form ‘what is the area of X?’ and ‘what is the length of boundary of X?’ than techniques based on arbitrary polygons (‘exact’ vector representations). They are however far more accurate than simplistic region representations such as bounding boxes. In the application where map data is being transmitted to mobile devices these methods are particularly attractive because the boundary (e.g., of a county) in effect comes free with the transmission of the point locations of (say) towns and villages. While techniques of this nature are in use as described to approximate boundaries it is not thought that any comparative work on the different possible constructions has been carried out. Also no analysis of the likely errors (as opposed to actual errors for specific cases) exists, so it is not yet possible to say for a real data set that the error is better or worse than expected, or, if the error cannot be calculated, what it is likely to be. The results in this paper should enable the likely degree of uncertainty to be taken into account in future work using these techniques. In approximating a region the area error is made up of areas modelled as inside the region which are in fact outside (+ve areas) and areas modelled as outside which are in fact inside (−ve areas). A related measure, the RMS (Root Mean Squared) distance between the constructed approximation line and the region boundary, is considered to be more informative.	approximation algorithm;data point;delaunay triangulation;information;minimum bounding box;mobile device;region of interest;towns;voronoi diagram;word lists by frequency	Michael John Barclay;Antony Galton	2008	Computers, Environment and Urban Systems	10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2008.06.003	combinatorics;delaunay triangulation;voronoi diagram;calculus;mathematics;geometry;geographic information system;statistics;monte carlo method	DB	30.81738125475333	14.508139760801635	43316

We show that a variational characterization of the Rényi divergences between two probability distributions on a measurable space in terms of relative entropies, when combined with the elementary variational formula for exponential integrals of bounded measurable functions in terms of relative entropy, yields the variational formula of Atar, Chowdhary, and Dupuis as a corollary. We then develop an analogous variational characterization of the Rényi divergence rates between two stationary finite state Markov chains in terms of relative entropy rates. When combined with Varadhan’s variational characterization of the spectral radius of square matrices with nonnegative entries in terms of relative entropy, this yields an analog of the variational formula of Atar, Chowdary, and Dupuis in the framework of stationary finite state Markov chains.	calculus of variations;erdős–rényi model;kullback–leibler divergence;markov chain;rényi entropy;stationary process;time complexity;variational principle	Venkat Anantharam	2018	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2018.2861013	kullback–leibler divergence;probability distribution;combinatorics;measurable function;computer science;bounded function;exponential integral;spectral radius;random variable;markov chain	ML	43.980294400737016	13.299540732852147	43351

In order to do so, we study the probability that a random walk on a random graph returns to its originating vertex at the k-th step, for various values of k. Our main theorem about eigenvalues is that E {|λ2(G)|} ≤ ( 2 √ 2d− 1 ( 1 + log d √ 2d +O ( 1 √ d )) + O ( d log logn log n ))m for any m ≤ 2 ⌊ logn b √ 2d− 1/2c/ log d ⌋ , where E { } denotes the expected value over a certain probablity space of 2d-regular graphs.

Rather than using a large linear program with a quadratic number of variables, we apply the theory of optimal transportation and pass to a dual differential formulation with linear scaling. After discretization using finite elements (FEM) and development of an accompanying optimization method, we apply our new EMD to problems in graphics and geometry processing. In particular, we uncover a class of smooth distances on a surface transitioning from a purely spectral distance to the geodesic distance between points; these distances also can be extended to the volume inside and outside the surface. A number of additional applications of our machinery to geometry problems in graphics are presented.	ab initio quantum chemistry methods;discretization;distance (graph theory);finite element method;geometry processing;graphics;image scaling;linear programming;mathematical optimization	Justin Solomon;Raif M.

All functions in sight are discrete and defined on the integers. Also, the proofs of the theorems do not use convexity and monotonicity of the more abstract optimization techniques.	optimizing compiler	David C. Rine	1977	J. Comb. Theory, Ser.

8c750df59da20ffd6d2a75b90885a57ba6d5801e	an algebraic topological approach to privacy: numerical and categorical data		In this paper, we cast the classic problem of achieving k-anonymity for a given database as a problem in algebraic topology. Using techniques from this field of mathematics, we propose a framework for k-anonymity that brings new insights and algorithms to anonymize a database. We begin by addressing the simpler case when the data lies in a metric space. This case is instrumental to introduce the main ideas and notation. Specifically, by mapping a database to the Euclidean space and by considering the distance between datapoints, we introduce a simplicial representation of the data and show how concepts from algebraic topology, such as the nerve complex and persistent homology, can be applied to efficiently obtain the entire spectrum of k-anonymity of the database for various values of k and levels of generalization. For this representation, we provide an analytic characterization of conditions under which a given representation of the dataset is k-anonymous. We introduce a weighted barcode diagram which, in this context, becomes a computational tool to tradeoff data anonymity with data loss expressed as level of generalization. Some simulations results are used to illustrate the main idea of the paper. We conclude the paper with a discussion on how to extend this method to address the general case of a mix of categorical and metric data.	algorithm;barcode;categorical variable;database;diagram;homology (biology);information privacy;linear algebra;persistence (computer science);persistent homology;simulation	Alberto Speranzon;Shaunak Dattaprasad Bopardikar	2016	CoRR		computer science;theoretical computer science;data mining;database;statistics	DB	41.488292944072796	22.025928826020696	43574

4868f817e8a8c3d9dde698e4b08ed94757700906	on the sum of square roots of polynomials and related problems	polynomials;arithmetic circuits;sum of square roots	The sum of square roots over integers problem is the task of deciding the sign of a nonzero sum, <i>S</i> = ∑<sub>i=1</sub><sup>n</sup> <i>Δ</i><sub>i</sub> · √<i>a</i><sub>i</sub>, where <i>Δ</i><sub>i</sub> ∈ {+1, −1} and <i>a</i><sub>i</sub>’s are positive integers that are upper bounded by <i>N</i> (say). A fundamental open question in numerical analysis and computational geometry is whether ∣<i>S</i>∣ ≥ 1/2<sup>(n ·log N)O(1)</sup> when <i>S</i> ≠ 0. We study a formulation of this problem over polynomials. Given an expression <i>S</i> = ∑<sub>i=1</sub><sup>n</sup> <i>c</i><sub>i</sub> · √<i>f</i><sub>i</sub>(<i>x</i>), where <i>c</i><sub>i</sub>’s belong to a field of characteristic 0 and <i>f</i><sub>i</sub>’s are univariate polynomials with degree bounded by <i>d</i> and <i>f</i><sub>i</sub>(0)≠0 for all <i>i</i>, is it true that the minimum exponent of <i>x</i> that has a nonzero coefficient in the power series <i>S</i> is upper bounded by (<i>n</i> · <i>d</i>)<sup>O(1)</sup>, unless <i>S</i> = 0? We answer this question affirmatively. Further, we show that this result over polynomials can be used to settle (positively) the sum of square roots problem for a special class of integers: Suppose each integer <i>a</i><sub>i</sub> is of the form, <i>a</i><sub>i</sub> = <i>X</i><sup>d</sup><sub>i</sub> + <i>b</i><sub>i1</sub><i>X</i><sup>di−1</sup> +...+ <i>b</i><sub>idi</sub>, <i>d</i><sub>i</sub> > 0, where <i>X</i> is a positive real number and <i>b</i><sub>ij</sub>’s are integers. Let <i>B</i> = max ({∣<i>b</i><sub>ij</sub>∣}<sub>i, j</sub>, 1) and <i>d</i> = max<sub>i</sub>{<i>d</i><sub>i</sub>}. If <i>X</i> > (<i>B</i> + 1)<sup>(n·d)O(1)</sup> then a nonzero <i>S</i> = ∑<sub>i=1</sub><sup>n</sup> <i>Δ</i><sub>i</sub> · √<i>a</i><sub>i</sub> is lower bounded as ∣<i>S</i>∣ ≥ 1/<i>X</i><sup>(n·d)O(1)</sup>. The constant in <i>O</i>(1), as fixed by our analysis, is roughly 2.  We then consider the following more general problem. Given an arithmetic circuit computing a multivariate polynomial <i>f</i>(<b>X</b>) and integer <i>d</i>, is the degree of <i>f</i>(<b>X</b>) less than or equal to <i>d</i>? We give a coRP<sup>PP</sup>-algorithm for this problem, improving previous results of Allender et al.

In this problem, each node is associated with some possibly unknown injection, each line has two unknown flows at its ends related to each other via a nonlinear function, and all injections and flows need to satisfy certain box constraints. This problem, named generalized network flow (GNF), is highly non-convex due to its nonlinear equality constraints. Under the practical assumption of monotonicity and convexity of the flow and cost functions, a convex relaxation is proposed, which always finds the optimal injections. This relaxation may fail to find optimal flows because the mapping from injections to flows might lead to an exponential number of solutions. However, once optimal injections are found in polynomial time, other techniques can be used to find a feasible set of flows corresponding to the injections. A primary application of this work is in optimization over power networks. Recent work on the optimal power flow (OPF) problem has shown that this non-convex problem can be solved efficiently using semidefinite programming (SDP) after two approximations: relaxing angle constraints (by adding virtual phase shifters) and relaxing power balance equations to inequality constraints. The results of this work prove two facts for the OPF problem: (i) the second approximation (on balance equations) is not needed in practice under a very mild angle assumption, and (ii) if the SDP relaxation fails to find a rank-one solution, the optimal injections (and not flows) may still be recovered from an undesirable high-rank solution.	algorithm;approximation;computer engineering;computer science;convex function;convex hull;convex optimization;emoticon;feasible region;flow network;greibach normal form;ibm power systems;kleene star;linear programming relaxation;loss function;lossless compression;lossy compression;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;minimum-cost flow problem;nonlinear system;operations research;semidefinite programming;simulation;social inequality;time complexity;transmission line	Somayeh Sojoudi;Javad Lavaei	2013	52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2013.6761089	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;convex optimization;circulation problem;minimum-cost flow problem;multi-commodity flow problem;mathematics;mathematical economics;approximation theory	EDA	27.501886349438383	12.331562672754643	43714
1cd931262f341713ac17fc6373d726a047ccf2bf	clique-stable set separation in perfect graphs with no balanced skew-partitions	trigraph;perfect graph;2 join;clique stable set separation	Inspired by a question of Yannakakis on the Vertex Packing polytope of perfect graphs, we study the Clique-Stable Set separation in a non-hereditary subclass of perfect graphs. A cut (B,W ) of G (a bipartition of V (G)) separates a clique K and a stable set S if K ⊆ B and S ⊆ W . A Clique-Stable Set separator is a family of cuts such that for every clique K, and for every stable set S disjoint from K, there exists a cut in the family that separates K and S. Given a class of graphs, the question is to know whether every graph of the class admits a Clique-Stable Set separator containing only polynomially many cuts. It was recently proved to be false for the class of all graphs (Göös 2015), but it remains open for perfect graphs, which was Yannakakis’ original question. Here we investigate this problem on perfect graphs with no balanced skew-partition; the balanced skew-partition was introduced in the decomposition theorem of Berge graphs which led to the celebrated proof of the Strong Perfect Graph Theorem. Recently, Chudnovsky, Trotignon, Trunck and Vušković proved that forbidding this unfriendly decomposition permits to recursively decompose Berge graphs (more precisely, Berge trigraphs) using 2-join and complement 2-join until reaching a “basic” graph, and in this way, they found an efficient combinatorial algorithm to color those graphs. We apply their decomposition result to prove that perfect graphs with no balanced skewpartition admit a quadratic-size Clique-Stable Set separator, by taking advantage of the good behavior of 2-join with respect to this property. We then generalize this result and prove that the Strong Erdős-Hajnal property holds in this class, which means that every such graph has a linear-size biclique or complement biclique. This is remarkable since the property does not hold for all perfect graphs (Fox 2006), and this is motivated here by the following statement: when the Strong Erdős-Hajnal property holds in a hereditary class of graphs, then both the Erdős-Hajnal property and the polynomial Clique-Stable Set separation hold. Finally, we define the generalized k-join and generalize both our results on classes of graphs admitting such a decomposition.	qr decomposition	Aurélie Lagoutte;Théophile Trunck	2016	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.disc.2016.02.005	strong perfect graph theorem;1-planar graph;block graph;pathwidth;perfect graph theorem;split graph;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;cograph;independent set;bipartite graph;perfect graph;clique problem;trivially perfect graph;graph coloring;clique-sum;trapezoid graph;mathematics;maximal independent set;modular decomposition;treewidth;chordal graph;indifference graph;algorithm;algebra	Theory	26.075880376668074	25.759480345880334	43732

The shortest-path distance according to the edge-weights defines a metric <i>d<subscrpt>T</subscrpt></i> on the vertex set <i>V</i>. We now ask the following question: Is it possible to define another weighted tree <i>T</i>* = (<i>R</i>, <i>E</i>*, <i>w</i>* : <i>E</i>* ↣ R<sup>+</sup>), this time on <i>just the red vertices</i> so that the shortest-path metric <i>d<subscrpt>T</subscrpt></i>* induced by <i>T</i>* on the vertices in <i>R</i> is “close” to the metric <i>d<subscrpt>T</subscrpt></i> restricted to the red vertices? I.e., does there exist a weighted tree <i>T</i>* = (<i>R</i>, <i>E</i>*, <i>c</i>*) and a (small) constant α such that <i>d<subscrpt>T</subscrpt></i>(<i>u</i>, <i>v</i>) ≤ <i>d<subscrpt>T</subscrpt></i>* (<i>u</i>, <i>v</i>) ≤ α <i>d<subscrpt>T</subscrpt></i>(<i>u</i>, <i>v</i>) for any two red vertices <i>u</i>, <i>v</i> ∈ <i>R</i>? We answer this question in the affirmative, and give a linear time algorithm to obtain a tree <i>T</i>* with α ≤ 8. We also give two applications of this result: an upper bound, in which we show that emulating multicasts using unicasts can be almost as good as general multicasts for certain performance measures; and a lower bound, in which we give a simple combinatorial proof of the fact that the metric generated by a graph of girth<i>g</i> must suffer a distortion of at least &OHgr;(<i>g</i>) when approximated by a tree.	approximation algorithm;distortion;emulator;existential quantification;girth (graph theory);shortest path problem;steiner tree problem;time complexity;vertex (geometry);vertex (graph theory)	Anupam Gupta	2001			mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;geometry;upper and lower bounds;bound graph;approximation algorithm;algorithm;shortest-path tree	Theory	25.159508947368867	21.305459994992486	43768

30b13466d38abd9178973b611ccb5ced6d05e47e	size expansions of mean field approximation: transient and steady-state analysis		Abstract Mean field approximation is a powerful tool to study the performance of large stochastic systems that is known to be exact as the system’s size N goes to infinity. Recently, it has been shown that, when one wants to compute expected performance metric in steady-state, this approximation can be made more accurate by adding a term V ∕ N to the original approximation. This is called a refined mean field approximation in Nicolas Gast and Benny Van Houdt (2017). In this paper, we improve this result in two directions. First, we show how to obtain the same result for the transient regime. Second, we provide a further refinement by expanding the term in 1 ∕ N 2 (both for transient and steady-state regime). Our derivations are inspired by moment-closure approximation, a popular technique in theoretical biochemistry. We provide a number of examples that show: (1) that this new approximation is usable in practice for systems with up to a few tens of dimensions, and (2) that it accurately captures the transient and steady state behavior of such systems.

This problem is NP-complete. In real world applications, guard power is limited and can only cover things within a range. Considering this limitation, the present study introduces the “ terrain guard range ” as a new geometric parameter by discretizing the definition of range, then presents a fixed-parameter algorithm to demonstrate that the 1.5D terrain guarding problem is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the introduced parameter.	cobham's thesis;exact algorithm;parameterized complexity	Farnoosh Khodakarami;Farzad Didehvar;Ali Mohades	2017	Theor.

We describe a geometric criterion to check whether a partition of the manifold actually forms a triangulation (which subsumes that it is a simplicial complex). We provide an incremental algorithm to compute the Delaunay triangulation of the manifold defined by a given set of input points, if it exists. Otherwise, the algorithm returns the Delaunay triangulation of a finite-sheeted covering space of the manifold. The algorithm has optimal randomized worst-case time and space complexity. It extends to closed Euclidean orbifolds. An implementation for the special case of the 3D flat torus has been released in Cgal 3.5. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first general result on this topic.	best, worst and average case;cgal;covering space;dspace;delaunay triangulation;euclidean distance;randomized algorithm;simplicial complex	Manuel Caroli;Monique Teillaud	2016	Discrete & Computational Geometry	10.1007/s00454-016-9782-6	seven-dimensional space;minimum-weight triangulation;combinatorics;topology;delaunay triangulation;covering space;ruppert's algorithm;pitteway triangulation;point set triangulation;mathematics;geometry;constrained delaunay triangulation;euclidean distance matrix;chew's second algorithm;implementation;bowyer–watson algorithm	Theory	29.934093493246802	19.084795863126832	43882

E. A directed graph is fraternally oriented if it has no 1-obstructions and it is perfectly oriented if it has no 2-obstructions. A directed graph is normal if it has no directed triangles. We describe polynomial time algorithms for the recognition of a chordless directed path of a given parity between two vertices in a directed graph without m-obstructions, and when m = 2q, for the recognition of odd holes. These are used to test whether a normal fraternally or perfectly oriented graph is perfect (assuming the Strong Perfect Graph Conjecture). In addition, we describe a polynomial time algorithm to find a kernel in a normal fraternally oriented graph using a structural characterization of the subgraph generated by two kernels.

The radio labeling problem (RL) consists in determining a radio labeling that minimizes the maximum label that is used (the so-called span of the labeling). RL is a well-studied problem, mainly motivated by frequency assignment problems in which transmitters are not allowed to operate on the same frequency channel. We consider the special case where some of the transmitters have preassigned operating frequency channels. This leads to the natural variants p-RL(l) and p-RL(∗) of RL with l preassigned labels and an arbitrary number of preassigned labels, respectively. We establish a number of combinatorial, algorithmical, and complexity-theoretical results for these variants of radio labeling. In particular, we investigate a simple upper bound on the minimum span, yielding a linear time approximation algorithm with a constant additive error bound for p-RL(∗) restricted to graphs with girth ≥ 5. We consider the complexity of p-RL(l) and p-RL(∗) for several cases in which RL is known to be polynomially solvable. On the negative side, we prove that p-RL(∗) is NP-hard for cographs and for k-colorable graphs where a k-coloring is given (k ≥ 3). On the positive side, we derive polynomial time algorithms solving p-RL(∗) and p-RL(l) for graphs with bounded maximum degree, and for solving p-RL(l) for k-colorable graphs where a k-coloring is given.	additive model;approximation algorithm;channel (communications);clock rate;cograph;decision problem;girth (graph theory);graph coloring;neighbourhood (graph theory);time complexity;transmitter	Hans L.

They require to select a reference anchor in order to cancel nuisance parameters or relax stringent synchronization requirements. Thus, their localization performance relies heavily on the reference selection. In this article, we propose several reference-free localization estimators based on TOA measurements for a scenario, where anchor nodes are synchronized, and the clock of the target node runs freely. The reference-free LS estimators that are different from the reference-based ones do not suffer from a poor reference selection. Furthermore, we generalize existing reference-based localization estimators using TOA or TDOA measurements, which are scattered over different research areas, and we shed new light on their relations. We justify that the optimal weighting matrix can compensate the influence of the reference selection for reference-based weighted LS (WLS) estimators using TOA measurements, and make all those estimators identical. However, the optimal weighting matrix cannot decouple the reference dependency for reference-based WLS estimators using a nonredundant set of TDOA measurements, but can make the estimators using the same set identical as well. Moreover, the Cramér-Rao bounds are derived as benchmarks. Simulation results corroborate our analysis.	benchmark (computing);internationalization and localization;least squares;multilateration;requirement;simulation;time of arrival	Yiyin Wang;Geert Leus	2012	EURASIP J.

45206f1e5b7fcb9aa192922475a24165eeca8564	on the steiner 4-diameter of graphs		The Steiner distance of a graph, introduced by Chartrand, Oellermann, Tian and Zou in 1989, is a natural generalization of the concept of classical graph distance. For a connected graph G of order at least 2 and S⊆V(G), the Steiner distance dG(S) among the vertices of S is the minimum size among all connected subgraphs whose vertex sets contain S. Let n, k be two integers with 2 ≤ k ≤ n. Then the Steiner k-eccentricity ek(v) of a vertex v of G is defined by ek(v)=max{d(S) | S ⊆ V(G),  |S|=k,  and v ∈ S}. Furthermore, the Steiner k-diameter of G is sdiamk(G)=max{ek(v)|v∈V(G)}. In 2011, Chartrand, Okamoto and Zhang showed that k − 1 ≤ sdiamk(G) ≤ n − 1. In this paper, graphs with sdiam4(G) = 3, 4, n − 1 are characterized, respectively.	steiner tree problem	Zhao Wang;Yaping Mao;Hengzhe Li;Chengfu Ye	2018	Journal of Interconnection Networks	10.1142/S0219265918500020	connectivity;distance;vertex (geometry);computer science;steiner tree problem;topology;distributed computing;integer;graph	Theory	27.401147884956533	28.49958837645791	44178

The minimum color degree of G is the minimum number of different colors appearing on the edges incident with the vertices of G. In this paper, we study the existence of properly edge-colored cycles in (not necessarily properly) edgecolored complete graphs. Fujita and Magnant (2011) conjectured that in an edge-colored complete graph on n vertices with minimum color degree at least (n + 1)/2, each vertex is contained in a properly edge-colored cycle of length k, for all k with 3 ≤ k ≤ n. They confirmed the conjecture for k = 3 and k = 4, and they showed that each vertex is contained in a properly edge-colored cycle of length at least 5 when n ≥ 13, but even the existence of properly edge-colored Hamilton cycles is unknown (in complete graphs that satisfy the conditions of the conjecture).We prove a cycle extension result that implies that each vertex is contained in a properly edge-colored cycle of length at least the minimum color degree. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We show that U(μ, t) is a congruence relation on an n-ary semigroup S if μ is a fuzzy ideal of S. Based on this idea, we construct the lower and upper approximations in an n-ary semigroup. Furthermore, we introduce the notions of rough ideals and rough prime ideals by means of fuzzy ideals of an n-ary semigroup. In particular, the concepts of rough n-ary semigroups, rough homomorphisms are introduced and some relative properties are also investigated.

abd062cc2289baf0b5686d07b3ff08d065d1a69e	a polya contagion model for networks		A network epidemics model based on the classical Polya urn scheme is investigated. Temporal contagion processes are generated on the network nodes using a modified Polya sampling scheme that accounts for spatial infection among neighboring nodes. The stochastic properties and the asymptotic behavior of the resulting network contagion process are analyzed. Unlike the classical Polya process, the network process is noted to be nonstationary in general, although it is shown to be time invariant in its first and some of its second-order statistics and to satisfy martingale convergence properties under certain conditions. Three classical Polya processes, one computational and two analytical, are proposed to statistically approximate the contagion process of each node, showing a good fit for a range of system parameters. Finally, empirical results compare and contrast our model with the well-known discrete time susceptible-infected-susceptible model.

It promises almost exact recovery of high-dimensional signals from a very small set of measurements. However, this technique is challenged by the task of recovering signals immersed in noise. In this paper, we derive upper and lower bounds on mean squared recovery error of noisy signals. These bounds are valid for any number of acquired measurements and at any signal-to-noise ratio. This work is highly useful for the design of any compressed sensing-based real world application by quantifying recovery error entailed with realistic digital signal acquisition scenarios.

While the KLT remains applicable for non-Gaussian signals, it loses optimality and, is outperformed by the independent-component analysis (ICA), which aims at producing the most-decoupled representation. In this paper, we consider an extension of the classical AR(1) model that is driven by symmetric-alpha-stable (SαS) noise which is either Gaussian (α = 2) or sparse (0 <; α <; 2). For the sparse (non-Gaussian) regime, we prove that an expansion in a proper wavelet basis (including the Haar transform) is much closer to the optimal orthogonal ICA solution than the classical Fourier-type representations. Our criterion for optimality, which favors independence, is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the joint pdf of the original signal and the product of the marginals in the transformed domain. We also observe that, for very sparse AR(1) processes (α ≤ 1), the operator-like wavelet transform is indistinguishable from the ICA solution that is determined through numerical optimization.	autoregressive model;discrete cosine transform;haar wavelet;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;kullback–leibler divergence;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;portable document format;sparse matrix;stationary process;wavelet transform	Pedram Pad;Michael Unser	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2013.6638735	gaussian noise;wavelet;independent component analysis;computer vision;speech recognition;computer science;signal processing;pattern recognition;mathematics;discrete wavelet transform;statistics	Vision	51.79260598009475	14.861823757795207	44737

The dilation between any two vertices x and y in G is the ratio of the shortest path distance between x and y in G to the Euclidean distance between them. The maximum dilation over all pairs of vertices in G is called the dilation of G. In this paper, a randomized algorithm is presented which, when given a polygonal cycle C on n vertices in the plane, computes in O(n log3 n) expected time, the edge of C whose removal results in a polygonal path of smallest possible dilation. It is also shown that the edge whose removal gives a polygonal path of largest possible dilation can be computed in O(n log n) time. If C is a convex polygon, the running time for the latter problem becomes O(n). Finally, it is shown that a (1 - ϵ)-approximation to the dilation of every path C \{e}, for all edges e of C, can be computed in O(n log n) total time.	dilation (morphology)	Hee-Kap Ahn;Mohammad Farshi;Christian Knauer;Michiel H.

When given a class of functions and a finite collection of sets, one might be interested whether the class in question contains any function whose domain is a subset of the union of the sets of the given collection and whose restrictions to all of them belong to this class. The collections with the formulated property are said to be strongly join permitting for the given class (the notion of join permitting collection is defined in the same way, but without the words “a subset of”). Three theorems concerning certain instances of the problem are proved. A necessary and sufficient condition for being strongly join permitting is given for the case when, for some n, the class consists of the potentially partial recursive functions of n variables, and the collection consists of sets of n-tuples of natural numbers. The second theorem gives a sufficient condition for the case when the class consists of the continuous partial functions between two given topological spaces, and the collection consists of subsets of the first of them (the condition is also necessary under a weak assumption on the second one). The third theorem is of a similar character but, instead of continuity, it concerns computability in the spirit of the one in effective topological spaces.	computability;join (sql);recursion;scott continuity	Dimiter Skordev	2016	Logical Methods in Computer Science		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	38.27949275785898	27.42684516438434	44803
da919baa79917f900d0e5a88395cda0e43274556	crofton's differential equation		solving techniques [11], as well as in scattered journal articles (e.g., [10] and [13]), it is surprising that it does not appear in standard probability texts. Why not? One reason is that problems for which the method can be successfully applied are limited, since the computations of expectations in geometric probability can still be highly complex even after applying Croftonu0027s simplification. Nevertheless, the technique is helpful with a small number of very interesting problems. It also gives fascinating connections between probability, analysis, and differential geometry. Perhaps another reason that it does not appear is that Croftonu0027s technique is not clearly stated in the geometric probability books and the proofs offered there are only heuristic. In this article we discuss this problem and give a clear, but elementary derivation of a version of his differential equation. We also show that it is not essential to teach Croftonu0027s technique, since there is a more commonly used probabilistic technique that can be used in place of it. It is the technique of computing expectations by conditioning [12, p. 338]. In this article we show how this standard method can be used in place of Croftonu0027s differential equation to solve problems of geometric probability. Indeed, we show that for these problems the two methods are equivalent. Furthermore, we show how the technique of computing geometric expectations by conditioning can fill a gap in the application of Croftonu0027s original method.

An effective procedure for solving single commodity problems is described based on a variable dimension, complementary pivoting algorithm of Jones, Saigal, and Schneider. An implementation of this approach called the expanding equilibrium algorithm is described using network data structures and sparse graphs. The data structure that is used presorts the graph to avoid using linked lists while maintaining the flexibility to add arcs to the graph as the algorithm is executing. A computational experiment is developed showing the algorithm's ability to exploit the problem's underlying network and economic structure. Computational results are presented for a computer code written in C and tested on a large-scale, randomly generated problem.	algorithm;computation;data structure;effective method;jones calculus;linked list;procedural generation;sparse matrix	Michael H.

Strict inequalities are proved for connective constants of vertex-transitive graphs. Firstly, the connective constant decreases strictly when the graph is replaced by a non-trivial quotient graph. Secondly, the connective constant increases strictly when a quasitransitive family of new edges is added. These results have the following implications for Cayley graphs. The connective constant of a Cayley graph decreases strictly when a new relator is added to the group, and increases strictly when a non-trivial group element is declared to be a generator.	isogonal figure;logical connective;magma;quotient graph;self-avoiding walk;time complexity;vertex-transitive graph	Geoffrey R.

By capturing non-Markovian behavior in discrete or continuous time, as appropriate, the formalism affords higher modeling fidelity. Alone, discrete or continuous phase-type Petri nets have simple underlying Markov chains, but mixing the two complicates matters. We show that, in a mixed model where discrete-time transitions are synchronized, the underlying process is semi-regenerative and we can employ Markov renewal theory to formulate stationary or time-dependent solutions. Also noteworthy are the computational trade-offs between the so-called embedded and subordinate Markov chains, which we employ to improve the overall solution efficiency. We present a preliminary stationary solution method that shows promise in terms of time and space efficiency and demonstrate it on an aeronautical data link system application.	approximation algorithm;computation;embedded system;formal system;heuristic;markov chain;mixed model;semantics (computer science);semiconductor industry;stationary process;stationary state;stochastic petri net;stochastic process	Rob Jones;Gianfranco Ciardo	2001		10.1109/PNPM.2001.953366	markov decision process;time reversibility;markov chain;markov kernel;real-time computing;simulation;stochastic petri net;markov property;computer science;continuous-time markov chain;balance equation;operations management;markov renewal process;process architecture;markov process;markov model;petri net;variable-order markov model	ML	39.68074760603607	5.926607401662188	45028
13af5a4a5924ebd91aedd71efed291339c576bc2	a note on the computational complexity of unsmoothened vertex attack tolerance		We have previously introduced vertex attack tolerance (VAT) and unsmoothened VAT (UVAT), denoted respectively as τ(G) = minS⊂V |S| |V−S−Cmax(V−S)|+1 and τ̂(G) = minS⊂V |S| |V−S−Cmax(V−S)| , where Cmax(V − S) is the largest connected component in V − S, as appropriate mathematical measures of resilience in the face of targeted node attacks for arbitrary degree networks. Here we prove the hardness of approximating τ̂ under various plausible computational complexity hypotheses. 1. Definitions and Preliminaries Given a connected, undirected graph G = (V,E), the Vertex Attack Tolerance of G is denoted by τ(G) defined as follows:[3, 7, 2] τ(G) = min S⊂V,S 6=∅ { |S| |V − S −Cmax(V − S)|+ 1 } where Cmax(V −S) is the largest connected component in V −S. As in [2], we refer to connected, undirected graphs G = (V,E) with more than one node (|V | ≥ 2) as non-trivial. Remark 1.1. [2] For nontrivial G = (V,E), 0 < τ(G) ≤ 1. VAT was originally introduced as τ̂ (UVAT for “unsmoothened VAT”), of which τ is a smoothened variation, defined as follows[3, 7]: τ̂ = min S⊂V,S 6=∅ { |S| |V − S − Cmax(V − S)| } where Cmax(V −S) is the largest connected component in V −S. Note that for any graph G = (V,E) such that G is not a clique, the pair of nodes u, v Preprint submitted to arXiv March 29, 2016	attack tolerance;computational complexity theory;connected component (graph theory);cultured meat;graph (discrete mathematics);maxima and minima	Gunes Ercal	2016	CoRR		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	27.35400325478317	24.373427280104107	45050

For the uniform random neighborhood and for the symmetric 1D PCA the exact stationary distribution is computed for all finite n. This result is used to evaluate approximations (uni-variate and bi-variate marginals). It is proven that the uni-variate approximation (also called mean-field) is exact for the uniform random neighborhood PCA. The exact results and the approximations are used to investigate phase transitions. We compare the results of two order parameters, the uni-variate marginal and the normalized entropy. Sometimes different transitions are indicated by the Ehrenfest classification scheme. This result shows the limitations of using just one or two order parameters for detecting and classifying major transitions of the stationary distribution. Furthermore, finite size scaling is investigated. We show that extrapolations to n=∞ from numerical calculations of finite n can be misleading in difficult parameter regions. Here, exact analytical estimates are necessary.	probabilistic automaton	Heinz Mühlenbein;Thomas Aus der Fünten	2004	Advances in Complex Systems	10.1142/S0219525904000081	phase transition;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;stationary distribution;quantum finite automata;mean field theory;probabilistic automaton;mathematics;statistics	Logic	43.923413396945065	13.879346605649328	45112

This randomized approach is based on a variant of red-blue intersections and is appealing due to its elegance and practical efficiency when compared to parametric search.  We introduce the first algorithm to compute the geodesic Fréchet distance between two polygonal curves <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> inside a simple bounding polygon <i>P</i>. The geodesic Fréchet <i>decision</i> problem is solved almost as fast as its nongeodesic sibling in <i>O</i>(<i>N</i><sup>2</sup> log <i>k</i>) time and <i>O</i>(<i>k</i>+<i>N</i>) space after <i>O(k)</i> preprocessing, where <i>N</i> is the larger of the complexities of <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> and <i>k</i> is the complexity of <i>P</i>. The geodesic Fréchet <i>optimization</i> problem is solved by a randomized approach in <i>O</i>(<i>k</i>+<i>N</i><sup>2</sup> log <i>kN</i> log <i>N</i>) expected time and <i>O</i>(<i>k</i>+<i>N</i><sup>2</sup>) space. This runtime is only a logarithmic factor larger than the standard nongeodesic Fréchet algorithm [Alt and Godau 1995].

For transversal intersections, the direction at an point can be computed by the extension of the vector product of the normal vectors of three hypersurfaces. However, when the three normal vectors are not linearly independent, the tangent direction cannot be determined by this method. If normal vectors of hypersurfaces are parallel ( N 1 = N 2 = N 3 ) we have intersection, and if normal vectors of hypersurfaces are not parallel but are linearly dependent we have intersection. In each case, we obtain unit tangent vector (t), principal normal vector (n), binormal vectors ( b 1 , b 2 ) and curvatures ( k 1 , k 2 , k 3 ) of the curve. We study the non-transversal of parametric hypersurfaces in 4-space.We classify the non-transversal in two different cases called intersection and tangential obtain all the Frenet apparatus for the almost intersection.We obtain all the Frenet apparatus for the intersection.

3db94683cf60f5b7088cbab14510abe7def8d9bc	on distributed nonlinear signal analytics : bandwidth and approximation error tradeoffs		Analytics will be a part of the upcoming smart city and Internet of Things (IoT). The focus of this work is approximate distributed signal analytics. It is envisaged that distributed IoT devices will record signals, which may be of interest to the IoT cloud. Communication of these signals from IoT devices to the IoT cloud will require (lowpass) approximations. Linear signal approximations are well known in the literature. It will be outlined that in many IoT analytics problems, it is desirable that the approximated signals (or their analytics) should always over-predict the exact signals (or their analytics). This distributed nonlinear approximation problem has not been studied before. An algorithm to perform distributed over-predictive signal analytics in the IoT cloud, based on signal approximations by IoT devices, is proposed. The fundamental tradeoff between the signal approximation bandwidth used by IoT devices and the approximation error in signal analytics at the IoT cloud is quantified for the class of differentiable signals. Simulation results are also presented.	approximation algorithm;approximation error;cloud computing;internet of things;low-pass filter;nonlinear system;polynomial;simulation;smart city;wavelet	Vijay Anavangot;Animesh Kumar	2018	CoRR		smart city;differentiable function;cloud computing;nonlinear system;approximation error;distributed computing;bandwidth (signal processing);analytics;internet of things;computer science	EDA	50.726184813859156	18.257459505613117	45433

In this paper, we investigate performance lower bounds on the mean-square-error (MSE) of any estimator for the Bayesian linear model, corrupted by a noise distributed according to an i.i.d. Student's t-distribution. This class of prior parametrized by its degree of freedom is relevant to modelize either dense or sparse (accounting for outliers) noise. Using the hierarchical Normal-Gamma representation of the Student's t-distribution, the Van Trees' Bayesian Cramér-Rao bounds (BCRBs) on the amplitude parameters and the noise hyperparameter are derived. Furthermore, the Random Matrix Theory (RMT) framework is assumed, i.e., the number of measurements and the number of unknown parameters grow jointly to infinity with an asymptotic finite ratio. Using some powerful results from the RMT, closed-form expressions of the BCRB are derived and studied. Finally, we propose a framework to fairly compare two models corrupted by noises with different degrees of freedom for a fixed common target signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In particular, we focus our effort on the comparison of the BCRBs associated with two models corrupted by a sparse noise promoting outliers and a dense (Gaussian) noise, respectively.	linear model;mean squared error;regular expression;robustness (computer science);signal-to-noise ratio;sparse matrix;tails;virtual economy	Virginie Ollier;Rémy Boyer;Mohammed Nabil El Korso;Pascal Larzabal	2016	2016 IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop (SAM)	10.1109/SAM.2016.7569694	gaussian noise;econometrics;estimation;sparse matrix;noise measurement;pattern recognition;mathematics;signal-to-noise ratio;statistics	ML	49.80271207704025	9.900631638551417	45457

However, in some cases, if S has certain topological properties, we can conclude that S is computable. It is known that if a semi-computable set S is a compact manifold with boundary, then the computability of ∂S implies the computability of S. In this paper we examine the case when S is a 1-manifold with boundary, not necessarily compact. We show that a similar result holds in this case under assumption that S has finitely many components.	computability;computable function;recursive set;semiconductor industry	Konrad Burnik;Zvonko Iljazovic	2014	Logical Methods in Computer Science	10.2168/LMCS-10(2:8)2014	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;computable function;recursive set;computable analysis	Theory	38.597973901952585	26.56045210620123	45748

If the cost of accessing $R_i $ is proportional to i (as in sequential search) then it is advantageous if each access is accompanied by a simple reordering operation. This operation is chosen so that ultimately the list will be sorted in the descending order of the access probabilities.In this paper we present two list organizing schemes, the first of which uses bounded memory and the second of which uses memory proportional to the number of elements in the list. Both of the schemes reorder the list by moving only the accessed element.

Specifically, for each i = 0, 1, . . . , d − 1, we are given a finite set Si of i-flats in R d or in C, and a (complete) flag is a tuple (f0, f1, . . . , fd−1), where fi ∈ Si for each i and fi ⊂ fi+1 for each i = 0, 1, . . . , d − 2. Our main result is an upper bound on the number of flags which is tight in the worst case. We also study several other kinds of incidence problems, including (i) incidences between points and lines in R such that among the lines incident to a point, at most O(1) of them can be coplanar, (ii) incidences with Legendrian lines in R, a special class of lines that arise when considering flags that are defined in terms of other groups, and (iii) flags in R (involving points, lines, and planes), where no given line can contain too many points or lie on too many planes. The bound that we obtain in (iii) is nearly tight in the worst case.

Then S is a rad(G)-forcing set (or a radius-forcing set of G) if, for each v E V(G), there exists v' E S with dc(v, v') ?: rad(G). The cardinality of a smallest radius-forcing set of G is called the radius-forcing number of G and is denoted by rf(G). A graph G is called a randomly k-forcing graph for a positive integer k if every k-subset of V(G) is a radius-forcing set of G. We investigate the value of rf(G) for various graphs G, and obtain some general bounds, and we characterize graphs for which rf achieves the values of 1, 2, p-1, and p, respectively. We establish the NPcompleteness of the calculation of rf for arbitrary graphs, and conclude with an investigation of k-randomly forcing graphs. 1. Introductory definitions and examples Let G be a connected graph of order p and vertex set V (G). Suppose that the vertices of G represent p facilities in which essential data or materials are storeable (for example, warehouses, rooms, computers in an information network). Two vertices in G are joined by an edge if the corresponding facilities are linked or adjacent or are somehow """"close"""" to each other. Suppose that it has been determined that, for some kEN, if a disaster or failure of some kind occurs at a facility (represented by a vertex v, say), then all facilities represented by vertices at distance at most k 1 from v will be jeopardized. The problem at hand now is to select the smallest possible subset of V (G) so that, if our essential material is stored in the facilities corresponding to this subset, then our system, in the most economical way, has the property that our material, or information, is retrievable from somewhere in the system even in the case when an arbitrary facility fails. One option, of course, is to design G to have radius at least k and to store all essential data in each facility, but this is an expensive option. However, if rad( G) ?: k and if S is a smallest subset of V(G) with the property that, for each w E V(G), there exists w' E S such that dc ( w, w') ?: k, then selecting the lSI facilities represented by S as the set of facilities at which to store our essential data will produce a choice that may be considerably cheaper, but which still provides the required security. In this paper, we will consider the case where rad( G) = k. Australasian Journal of Combinatorics 17(1998), pp.39-49 Let G be a (connected) graph, a E V(G) and A, S ~ V(G). We define the generalized S-eccentricity of a in G, eG(a, S), by eG(a, S) = max{dG(a, s); s E S}. If w is a vertex in S for which eG(a, S) = dG(a, w), we will call w an 8-eccentric vertex of a. We define rad(A, S, G), the radius of A with respect to 8 in G, by rad(A,S,G) = min{eG(a,S); a E A}. If S is such that rad(A, S, G) = rad( G), then S is called an A-rad(G}-forcing set; the size of a smallest A-rad( G)-forcing set is denoted by rf(A, G) and called the A-rad(G}-forcing number. If rad(V(G), S, G) = rad(G), then (briefly) 8 is a rad(G)forcing set, or simply a radius-forcing set if no ambiguity is possible; the size of a smallest rad( G)-forcing set, denoted by rf( G), is called the radius-forcing number of G. Also, we abbreviate rad(V(G), S, G) by rad(S, G). (Notice that rf(G) can be seen as the smallest number of vertices in a subset 8 of V(G) such that each vertex of G is at distance at least rad(G) from some vertex in S.) In [4], Fajtlowicz introduced the class of graphs called r-ciliates and the following notion of r-criticality. Definition 1. For a, bEN with b ~ 3, let Cb,a be a graph obtained from b disjoint copies of Pa+1 by linking together one end-vertex of each in a cycle Cb• For r, a E N with r 2: a, the graphs C2a,r-a are called r-ciliates. A graph is r-critical if it has radius r and every proper induced connected subgraph has radius strictly smaller than r. Finally, for a connected graph G of radius r, we define the graph G* to be the graph given by V(G*) = V(G) and uv E E(G*) if and only if dG(u, v) 2: r. Notice that this graph G* provides a link between total domination and radiusforcing number since, by the definition of rf, '""""Yt(G*) = rf(G). Furthermore, it is not difficult to see that G* = Grad(G)-l. (This graph is a generalization, in a sense, of the antipodal graph A(G) of a graph G defined by R. R. Singleton [6], where A(G) C G* and uv E E(A(G)) if and only if dG(u, v) = diam{G).)"""	australasian conference on information systems;computer;connectivity (graph theory);distance (graph theory);dominating set;emoticon;graph (discrete mathematics);randomness;rapid application development;self-organized criticality;vertex (graph theory)	Peter Dankelmann;Vivienne Smithdorf;Henda C.

Physical processes are ubiquitously non-stationary and require time-dependent models for modeling and understanding their behavior. In contrast, most current computing platforms and their design methodologies lack proper models for the time component and mostly assume stationary (i.e., time independent) behavior. In this paper, we use empirical data to identify the main characteristics (e.g., self-similarity, nonstationarity) of various physical processes which can also be observed in the communication workload of real CPS. Starting from the complex characteristics of CPS workloads, we present a statistical physics inspired model which is used to define a new optimal control problem that not only accounts for the observed self-similarity and nonstationarity properties of the CPS workload, but also allows for accurate predictions on CPS dynamical trajectories during the optimization process.	computation;cyber-physical system;dynamic programming;ecosystem;formal system;fractal;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;online algorithm;optimal control;scheduling (computing);self-similarity;stochastic optimization;systems design	Paul Bogdan;Radu Marculescu	2011	2011 IEEE/ACM Second International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems	10.1109/ICCPS.2011.14	control engineering;stochastic process;simulation;fractional calculus;optimal control;fractal;design methods;computer science;sensor;theoretical computer science;machine learning;mathematical model;control theory;cyber-physical system;statistics	EDA	41.21423103997414	4.207708520913876	45907

Our study is carried out in a single-terminal setup as well as in a multi-terminal setup consisting of orthogonal or coherent multiple access channels (MAC). We adopt the mean square error (MSE) performance criterion for sparse source reconstruction in a system where source-to-sensor channel(s) and sensor-to-decoder communication channel(s) are noisy. Our proposed sensing matrix design procedure relies upon minimizing a lower-bound on the MSE in single- and multiple-terminal setups. We propose a three-stage sensing matrix optimization scheme that combines semi-definite relaxation (SDR) programming, a low-rank approximation problem and power-rescaling. Under certain conditions, we derive closed-form solutions to the proposed optimization procedure. Through numerical experiments, by applying practical sparse reconstruction algorithms, we show the superiority of the proposed scheme by comparing it with other relevant methods. This performance improvement is achieved at the price of higher computational complexity. Hence, in order to address the complexity burden, we present an equivalent stochastic optimization method to the problem of interest that can be solved approximately, while still providing a superior performance over the popular methods.	algorithm;approximation algorithm;coherence (physics);column (database);computational complexity theory;dimensionality reduction;etsi satellite digital radio;eigen (c++ library);experiment;linear matrix inequality;linear programming relaxation;low-rank approximation;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;optimization problem;semiconductor industry;semidefinite programming;slack variable;social inequality;sparse matrix;stochastic optimization;the matrix	Amirpasha Shirazinia;Subhrakanti Dey	2015	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2015.2455521	mathematical optimization;estimation;coherence;sparse matrix;sensor;noise measurement;theoretical computer science;machine learning;sparse approximation;mathematics;statistics	Vision	49.79775349453839	7.015339376066116	45949

Results obtained with our model can be used in various applications, such as GIS (imprecise spatial object modelling), robotics (environment models), and image analysis (imprecise feature extraction). Imprecise point objects are modelled as fuzzy points in linear fuzzy space. Linear fuzzy space is defined over Rn , where the membership function is convex, upper semi-continuous, symmetric w.r.t. the core and linearly decreasing w.r.t. the core distance, where the core is a single point. A fuzzy convex hull is defined in linear fuzzy space. The distance between objects/points is modelled as an imprecise point object in linear fuzzy space defined over R1. Fuzzy ordering relations are defined in distance space. The maximal distance is a fuzzy set over a set of distances. The maximal distance between a set of imprecise point objects is then determined as the maximal distance of fuzzy convex hull edge points. An algorithm for determining the maximal distance between imprecise points belonging to oneand two-dimensional linear fuzzy space is given. For an exact calculation of this maximal distance, computational complexity of the algorithm is of polynomial growth of the fourth degree. However, if the maximal distance is determined approximately, then the algorithms’ computational complexity is of power growth of the quadratic degree with respect to the cardinality of the convex edge. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

d34dd0aaf52cf8f6dad94e22b4d22b1cc0f18018	clustering to maximize the ratio of split to diameter		Given a weighted and complete graph G = (V, E), V denotes the set of n objects to be clustered, and the weight d(u, v) associated with an edge (u, v) ∈ E denotes the dissimilarity between objects u and v. The diameter of a cluster is the maximum dissimilarity between pairs of objects in the cluster, and the split of a cluster is the minimum dissimilarity between objects within the cluster and objects outside the cluster. In this paper, we propose a new criterion for measuring the goodness of clusters⎯the ratio of the minimum split to the maximum diameter, and the objective is to maximize the ratio. For k = 2, we present an exact algorithm. For k ≥ 3, we prove that the problem is NP-hard and present a factor of 2 approximation algorithm on the precondition that the weights associated with E satisfy the triangle inequality. The worst-case runtime of both algorithms is O(n). We compare the proposed algorithms with the Normalized Cut by applying them to image segmentation. The experimental results on both natural and synthetic images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.	approximation algorithm;best, worst and average case;cluster analysis;diameter (protocol);emoticon;exact algorithm;expectation–maximization algorithm;image segmentation;np-hardness;precondition;social inequality;synthetic intelligence	Jiabing Wang;Jiaye Chen	2012	CoRR		mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;statistics	ML	25.28275556698942	19.715503857400854	46146
f3b7a13e5c0b09646327e6cd908343b07e2727e3	on a sphere that passes through n lattice points	lattice points	In 1957, Steinhaus posed the problem that asks whether there is a circle in the plane that encloses a given number of lattice points. This problem also appears in [6]. Sierpinski solved this problem by observing that the distances from the point ( √ 2, 3 ) to the points of Z 2 are all different. Schoenberg [4,5] generalized Sierpinski’s observation to Qd case. As a variation of Steinhaus’ problem, Maehara and Matsumoto [2] considered whether there is a circle in the plane that passes through a given number of lattice points. They showed that the circle (2x−1)2+(2y)2 = 5k passes through exactly 2k+2 lattice points, and the circle (4x−1)2+(4y)2 = 52k passes through exactly 2k+ 1 lattice points. More generally, the following holds. Let k ≥ 0 be an integer and p be a prime such that p ≡ 1 (mod 4), pk ≡ 1 (mod 8). Then the circle defined by (4x− 1)2 + (4y)2 = pk passes through exactly k+ 1 lattice points (Lemma 3). There is also a sphere in R3 that passes through a given number of lattice points. For example, the sphere (4x− 1)2 + (4y)2 + (4z − √ 2)2 = pk + 2 passes through exactly k+ 1 lattice points. In this case, however, the k+ 1 lattice points lie on the plane z = 0. Then, is there a sphere in R3 that passes through a given number of lattice points not all lying on a plane?We answer this question by showing the following result. For every n > d ≥ m ≥ 2, there is a sphere in Rd that passes through exactly n lattice points, and moreover, the n lattice points span an m-dimensional flat (Theorem 3). As a consequence, it follows that for every positive integer d, there is a d-simplex in Rd whose vertices are all lattice points, and whose circumscribed sphere passes through no lattice points other than the vertices of the simplex.	emoticon;the circle (file system);vertex (geometry)	Hiroshi Maehara	2010	Eur.

The index stands for the i-th player, i = 1; : : : ; n. The players are linked by technical cooperations and the market, which expresses itself in the nonlinear time-discrete dynamics of the Technology-Emissions-Means-model, in short: TEMmodel. In the sense of environmental protection, the aim is to reach a state which is mentioned in the Kyoto Protocol by choosing the control parameters such that the emissions of each player become minimized. The focal point is the realization of the necessary optimal control parameters via a played cost game, which is determined by the way of cooperation of the actors. In application to the work of Leitmann, but not regarding solution sets as feasible sets, the -value of Tijs [13] is taken as a control parameter. This leads to a new class of problems in the area of 1-convex games. We want to solve the problem for a special case. With this solution a reasonable model for a Joint-Implementation process is developed, where its necessary fund is represented by the non-empty core of the analyzed game. Steering with parameters of this feasible set, the TEM-model can be regarded as a useful tool to implement and verify a technical Joint-Implementation Program. For the necessary data is given to the Clearing House, we are able to compare the numerical results with real world phenomena.	control theory;focal (programming language);feasible region;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;optimal control	Stefan Pickl	2001	Math.

Furthermore, we study maximum vertex congestion under geodesic routing and show that it scales as Ω(pn/D n) where Dn is the diameter of the graph. We also construct a constant degree family of expanders with congestion Θ(n) in contrast with random regular graphs that have congestion O(n log(n)). Finally, we study traffic congestion on graphs defined as product of trees.	network congestion;random regular graph;routing;spaces	Shi Li;Gabriel H.

In this paper, we consider a kinetic version of the problem where the points in R ∪ B move according to algebraic functions. We design a compact and local quadratic-space kinetic data structure (KDS) for maintaining the optimal solution in O(r log r + r log b) time per each event. We also study the general static problem where the maximum box can be arbitrarily oriented. This is an open problem in [1]. We show that our approach can be used to solve this problem in O((r + b)(r log r + r log b)) time. Finally we propose an efficient data structure to maintain an approximated solution of the kinetic Maximum Box Problem.	approximation algorithm;emoticon;kinetic data structure;linear algebra	Sergey Bereg;José Miguel Díaz-Báñez;Pablo Pérez-Lantero;Inmaculada Ventura	2011	J.

This is the classic question about the size of an L/n-net for these objects. It is well known that for fairly general classes of geometric objects the size of an L/n-net is O(n/L log n/L). There are some instances where this general bound can be improved, and this improvement is usually due to bounds on the combinatorial complexity (size) of the boundary of the union of these objects. Thus, the boundary of the union of m disks has size O(m), and this translates to an O(n/L) bound on the size of an L/n-net for disks. For m fat triangles, the size of the union boundary is O(m log log m), and this yields L/n-nets of size O(n/L log log n/L). Improved nets directly translate into an upper bound on the ratio between the optimal integral solution and the optimal fractional solution for the corresponding geometric set cover problem. Thus, for covering k points by disks, this ratio is O(1); and for covering k points by fat triangles, this ratio is O(log log k). This connection to approximation algorithms for geometric set cover is a major motivation for attempting to improve bounds on nets. Our main result is an argument that in some cases yields nets that are smaller than those previously obtained from the size of the union boundary. Thus for fat triangles, for instance, we obtain nets of size O(n/L log log log n). We use this to obtain a randomized polynomial time algorithm that gives an O(log log log k)-approximation for the problem of covering k points by the smallest subset of a given set of triangles.	approximation algorithm;combinatorial optimization;fat object;p (complexity);rp (complexity);randomized algorithm;set cover problem	Kasturi R.

We first concentrate on the pair Gromov-Hausdorff distance (GH) versus Hausdorff distance under the action of Euclidean isometries (EH). Then, we (1) show they are comparable in a precise sense that is not the linear behaviour one would expect and (2) explain the source of this phenomenon via explicit constructions. Finally, (3) by conveniently modifying the expression for the GH distance, we recover the EH distance. This allows us to uncover a connection that links the problem of computing GH and EH and the family of Euclidean Distance Matrix completion problems. The second pair of dissimilarity notions we study is the so called Lp-Gromov-Hausdorff distance versus the Earth Moverpsilas distance under the action of Euclidean isometries. We obtain results about comparability in this situation as well.	calculus of constructions;distance matrix;euclidean distance;exception handling;expect;exponential hierarchy;hausdorff dimension;shape context	Facundo Mémoli	2008	2008 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops	10.1109/CVPRW.2008.4563074	euclidean domain;earth mover's distance;euclidean group;hausdorff distance;combinatorics;minkowski distance;weighted voronoi diagram;topology;distance matrix;distance from a point to a plane;computational geometry;euclidean space;mahalanobis distance;euclidean distance;mathematics;geometry;earth;euclidean distance matrix;upper and lower bounds;distance	Vision	39.137662767635135	23.68548292085213	46832

A transmit waveform-receiver filter combination is then designed to achieve the best lower bound on performance within this class, assessed by signal-to-clutter-and-noise ratio.

This raises the question about the sufficiency of a particular Boolean network for properly reproducing a modeled phenomenon to make realistic predictions. The question actually depends on the invariant properties of behaviorally similar Boolean networks. In this article, we address this issue by considering that the similarity is formalized by isomorphism on graphs modeling their dynamics. The similarity also depends on the parameter governing the updating policy, called the mode. We define a general characterization of the group of isomorphism preserving the mode. From this characterization, we deduce invariant structural properties of the interaction graph and conditions to maintain an equivalence through mode variation.	boolean network;turing completeness	Franck Delaplace	2014	CoRR		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;boolean network;standard boolean model;theoretical computer science;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	48.376130267510106	21.304768163819414	47049

6057ffb21b0ced6fa44663fd3c8b47377f34c177	on primitive sets in graphs		In this paper we will be concerned with defining three types of primitive sets in a connected graph. Halin [2] first introduced the notion of a primitive set of vertices in a graph. Holding a subset A of the vertex set of a connected graph G fixed as an origin, we can write T:Q Tu0027 if T separates A and Tu0027. This relation is a quasi -order on the power set of the vertex set. Now we can force :Q to be a partial order calling sets primitive if they represent certain equivalence classes, as Halin [2] and later Sabidussi [5] and Polat [3], studying in detail an idea of Pym and Perfect [4], have done in different ways. But for each kind of primitivity the set of all primitive sets endowed with the relation :Q is a complete lattice, called Halin-Iattice (H-Iattice), Weak-separation-Iattice (W-Iattice) and Pym-and-Perfect-Iattice (P-Iattice) respectively. We compare the three types of primitive sets and prove that each complete lattice can be represented as an H -lattice and each P-Iattice as a W -lattice. Also we show by two examples that there exists a W-Iattice which cannot appear as a P-Iattice, and that there exists a complete lattice which cannot be represented as a W -lattice. The author is indebted to the referee, whose helpful suggestions shortened the proof of Theorem 5. For a graph G we denote the vertex set by V(G) and the edge set by E(G). Let Na(x) be the set of all neighbours of the vertex x in G and E(y; G) the set of all edges incident with yin G. A restriction X of a graph G is a subgraph of G for which x, y E V(X), [x, y] E E( G) always implies [x, y] E E(X) holds. For B s;; V( G) let G[B] be the restriction X of G, for which V(X) = B holds. A path W = (xo, ... ,xn) is a graph with V(W) = {xo, ... ,xn} (all Xi distinct) and E(W) = {[Xi-h xJi = 1, ... , n}. A circuit C = (xo, ... ,xn) is a graph with V( C) = {xo, ... ,xn} and E( C) = {[Xi-h xJi = 1, ... , n}u{[xm xo]}. The length of a circuit C is its number of edges. In the following three sections let G be a connected graph and As;; V(G) a fixed set of vertices.		Michael Hager	1982	Eur. J.

It is still a challenge to effectively achieve a High-quality Balanced Graph Partitioning for super-large graphs. In this paper, we propose a graph partitioning algorithm based on Label Swapping. Normalized Cut is used as optimization target and this algorithm iteratively updates the graph with Label Swapping. Specifically, by using sampling methods, our method can deal with super-large graph and increase the algorithm's efficiency. To improve the partition's quality, we further propose a variable neighborhood search(VNS) in our algorithm to escape the local optimum. Our experimental results on real-world datasets have shown that the partition's intra-cluster density is very good and and our algorithm outperforms METIS in term of minimum cut.	algorithm;combinatorial optimization;cut (graph theory);graph cuts in computer vision;graph partition;hot swapping;local optimum;local search (optimization);metis;mathematical optimization;maximum cut;minimum cut;optimizing compiler;paging;sampling (signal processing);variable neighborhood search	Huajian Zhang	2015	2015 International Conference on Behavioral, Economic and Socio-cultural Computing (BESC)	10.1109/BESC.2015.7365980	mathematical optimization;maximum cut;combinatorics;cut;graph bandwidth;graph partition;machine learning;mathematics	EDA	24.986100328478006	5.625474233598486	47272

It is shown that, without loss of generality, the search space can be restricted to a suitable subclass of decomposable models, whose members are called elementary models. The selected elementary model is constructed in an incremental manner according to a local-optimality criterion that consists in minimizing a suitable cost function. It is further shown with an example that the solution computed by the procedure is sometimes optimal.	approximation algorithm;heuristic;loss function;optimality criterion	Francesco M.

The underlying theory rests on a set of first order optimality conditions that parallel the Kuhn-Tucker conditions associated with a one-dimensional parametric linear program. The solution to the original problem is uncovered by systematically varying the parameter over the unit interval and solving the corresponding linear program. Finite convergence is established under nondegenerate assumptions. The paper also discusses other solution techniques including branch and bound and vertex enumeration and gives an example highlighting their computational and storage requirements. By these measures, the algorithm presented here has an overall advantage. Finally, a comparison is drawn between bicriteria and bilevel programming, and underscored by way of an example.	algorithm;optimization problem;program optimization	Jonathan F.

Generalizing earlier results on 3-contractible edges in spanning trees of 3-connected graphs, we prove that (except for the graphs Kk+1 if k ∈ {1, 2}) (a) every spanning tree of a k-connected triangle free graph has two k-contractible edges, (b) every spanning tree of a k-connected graph of minimum degree at least 3 2 k− 1 has two k-contractible edges, (c) for k > 3, every DFS tree of a kconnected graph of minimum degree at least 3 2 k− 3 2 has two k-contractible edges, (d) every spanning tree of a cubic 3-connected graph nonisomorphic to K4 has at least 1 3 |V (G)| − 1 many 3-contractible edges, and (e) every DFS tree of a 3-connected graph nonisomorphic to K4, the prism, or the prism plus a single edge has two 3-contractible edges. We also discuss in which sense these theorems are best possible.

The geometric probing problem considers how to optimally use a probe to measure geometric properties. In this paper, we consider a proximity probe which, given a point, returns the distance to the boundary of the nearest object. When there is an unknown convex polygon P in the plane, the goal is to minimize the number of probe measurement needed to exactly determine the shape and location of P. We present an algorithm with upper bound of 3.5n + k + 2 probes, where n is the number of vertices and k ≤ 3 is the number of acute angles of P. The algorithm requires constant time per probe, and hence, O(n) time to determine P. We also address the related problem where the unknown polygon is a member of a known finite set Γ and the goal is to efficiently determine which polygon is present. When m is the size of Γ and n' is the maximum number of vertices of any member of Γ, we present an algorithm with an upper bound of 2n + 2 probes with O(1) computations per probe and a O(n'm) preprocessing phase (depending only on Γ).	algorithm;approximation;computation;maximal set;polyhedron;preprocessor;robotics;time complexity;vertex (geometry)	Aviv Adler;Fatemeh Panahi;A.

9b3a67f0ff79153a3713c0ad8ecf14f1d6592451	computationally efficient direction of arrival estimation with unknown number of signals		Abstract In this paper, we investigate the problem of direction of arrival (DOA) estimation with unknown number of signals in the framework of beamforming. We show that the real part of the array output covariance matrix (R-AOCM) can be reformulated as an entire AOCM of a virtual array with available signal model for fast DOA estimate. By introducing an optimization problem to minimize the variance of the weighted output of this virtual array, DOA can be found by a novel real-valued real part Capon (R-Capon) estimator accordingly. Moreover, we prove that the rank of the R-AOCM is always no less than that of the entire AOCM, which suggests that R-Capon outperforms the standard Capon in scenarios with small numbers of snapshots. We also prove that the inverse of the R-AOCM can be equivalently jointed by those of two sub-matrices of about half sizes, and hence R-Capon has a significantly reduced computational complexity. These advantages as well as the theoretical analysis are finally verified by numerical simulations over a wide range of scenarios.	direction of arrival	Fenggang Yan;Jun Wang;Shuai Liu;Bin Cao;Ming Jin	2018	Digital Signal Processing	10.1016/j.dsp.2018.03.012	estimator;mathematical optimization;mathematics;covariance matrix;computational complexity theory;beamforming;optimization problem;direction of arrival	ML	51.612424256202736	7.759639282542721	47663

By the maximum principle, a harmonic curve has no bounded components; its topology is determined by the combinatorial data of a noncrossing matching. Similarly, every complex polynomial gives rise to a related combinatorial object that we call a basketball, consisting of a pair of noncrossing matchings satisfying one additional constraint. We prove that every noncrossing matching arises from some harmonic curve, and deduce from this that every basketball arises from some polynomial.	matching (graph theory);polynomial	Jeremy L.

One can see FM (A) as a family of finite arithmetics related to the arithmetic A. In the talk I will survey what is known about such arithmetics and their logical properties. The main questions will be the following: What is the complexity of theories of such families? What relations can be represented in such families? What are the possible ways to represent some infinite relations? What are the definabilities between such arithmetics? Especially, we focus our attention on finite arithmetics of the form: FM ((ω, +,×)), FM ((ω,×)), FM ((ω,⊥)), where +, ×, ⊥ are addition, multiplication and coprimality relation, respectively.	fm broadcasting;theory	Michal Krynicki;Marcin Mostowski;Konrad Zdanowski	2007	Fundam.

B 41 (1986) 182–208] have characterized the class of distance hereditary graphs where the distance is preserved in each connected induced subgraph. In this paper, we are interested in the class of k-distance hereditary graphs (k ∈ N)which consists in a parametric extension of the distance heredity notion. We allow the distance in each connected induced subgraph to increase by at most k. We provide a characterization of k-distance hereditary graphs in terms of forbidden configurations for each k ≥ 2. c © 2008 Elsevier B.V.
