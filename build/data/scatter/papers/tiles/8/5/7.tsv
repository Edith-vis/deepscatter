7d43da8e155d6b10fada56fded5aafc40835c99f	energy-efficiency maximisation for cooperative and non-cooperative ofdma cellular networks - a survey		With the increasing data rate necessity in modern cellular networks, power consumption grows continuously for network operators or mobile users. Under this scenario, negative implications arise, as for example economical and environmental, and also reduce user experience quality, as battery powered devices cannot operate for long time intervals without been charged. So, the development of energy-efficient resource allocation algorithms for modern cellular networks, as fourth generation (4G) systems, becomes a fundamental task. Since orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) is the most popular multiple access technique for modern cellular communications, this survey provides a guideline to energy-efficient approaches for OFDMA-based systems, discussing techniques and evaluation modes for energy-efficient systems. As cooperative communication has the potential to reduce power consumption and is included as features in 4G standards, this technique is also investigated in this survey.

ae9fd8ea618feaa530ea81897932b78862aa2262	joint service pricing and cooperative relay communication for federated learning		For the sake of protecting data privacy and due to the rapid development of mobile devices, e.g., powerful central processing unit (CPU) and nascent neural processing unit (NPU), collaborative machine learning on mobile devices, e.g., federated learning, has been envisioned as a new AI approach with broad application prospects. However, the learning process of the existing federated learning platforms rely on the direct communication between the model owner, e.g., central cloud or edge server, and the mobile devices for transferring the model update. Such a direct communication may be energy inefficient or even unavailable in mobile environments. In this paper, we consider adopting the relay network to construct a cooperative communication platform for supporting model update transfer and trading. In the system, the mobile devices generate model updates based on their training data. The model updates are then forwarded to the model owner through the cooperative relay network. The model owner enjoys the learning service provided by the mobile devices. In return, the mobile devices charge the model owner certain prices. Due to the coupled interference of wireless transmission among the mobile devices that use the same relay node, the rational mobile devices have to choose their relay nodes as well as deciding on their transmission powers. Thus, we formulate a Stackelberg game model to investigate the interaction among the mobile devices and that between the mobile devices and the model owner. The Stackelberg equilibrium is investigated by capitalizing on the exterior point method. Moreover, we provide a series of insightful analytical and numerical results on the equilibrium of the Stackelberg game.	central processing unit;content delivery network;information privacy;interaction;interference (communication);machine learning;mobile device;nash equilibrium;network processor;nouvelle ai;numerical analysis;relay;self-organization;server (computing);zeroth (software)	Shaohan Feng;Dusit Niyato;Ping Wang;Dong In Kim;Ying-Chang Liang	2018	CoRR			Mobile	31.567209203817146	97.13843250049166	18313

Our formulation is to maximize the throughput of femtocell users that share spectrum resources with macrocell base station (MBS) while limiting interference between macrocell and femtocells. Using cognitive capabilities, femtocell basestations (FBS) can acquire the needed information about the neighboring MBS users to reduce cross-tier interference between FBS and MBS users. We analyze the distributions of signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) of MBS users and signal to interference ratio (SIR) of FBS users. Based on the analytical results, we present resource assignment and power allocation solutions to maximize the mean sum rate subject to SINR and SIR outage constraints, along with simulation verifications.	channel state information;downtime;function-behaviour-structure ontology;greedy algorithm;interference (communication);multitier architecture;scheduling (computing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;sun outage;telecommunications link;throughput	Hesham M.

The optimal transmit weighting vector at the source is not available in the literature due to the non-linear DF operation, which causes the problem non-convex. By investigating the single-relay system, we show that the optimal transmit vector for the single-relay system can be determined by comparing the S-D beamformer (maximum-ratio-transmit beamforming vector for the S-D link) with the one that utilizes “just sufficient” energy to activate the relay-link. This idea is then applied to the multi-relay system to propose a selective water-filling algorithm, where the optimal solution is obtained by comparing the S-D beamformer with schemes that selectively activate different combinations of relay-links.	beamforming;consensus dynamics;convex function;direction finding;nonlinear system;relay;water filling algorithm	Shenghui Song;Keith Q.

The proposed algorithm is obtained from the solution of a non-convex optimization problem for the maximization of the weighted system throughput. We employ monotonic optimization to develop the optimal joint power and subcarrier allocation policy. The optimal resource allocation policy serves as a performance benchmark due to its high complexity. Furthermore, to strike a balance between computational complexity and optimality, a suboptimal scheme with low computational complexity is proposed. Our simulation results reveal that the suboptimal algorithm achieves a close-to-optimal performance and MC-NOMA employing the proposed resource allocation algorithm provides a substantial system throughput improvement compared to conventional multicarrier orthogonal multiple access (MC-OMA).	algorithm design;benchmark (computing);computation;computational complexity theory;convex optimization;entropy maximization;mathematical optimization;oma;optimization problem;simulation;subcarrier;throughput	Yan Sun;Derrick Wing Kwan Ng;Zhiguo Ding;Robert Schober	2016	2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7842087	mathematical optimization;throughput;real-time computing;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;multiplexing	HPC	33.229900683013476	91.11963244693473	19450

In this paper, we investigate optimal D2D mode switching to maximize the network spectrum-efficiency (SE). We formulate the optimal SE problems in three D2D transmission modes, dedicated mode, reusing mode and cellular mode, while guaranteeing the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements for both the D2D pairs and the regular cellular users (RCUs). Bisection algorithm is adopted to solve the quasiconvex optimization problems in the dedicated and cellular modes through transforming the original problem into a sequence of convex feasibility problems. For the reusing mode, concave-convex procedure (CCCP) is used to solve the difference of convex (D. C.) optimization problem. Simulation results show that system SE can be improved significantly with the proposed mode switching algorithm compared with the single mode transmission without mode switching.	algorithm;bisection method;concave function;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;optimization problem;quality of service;quasiconvex function;read-copy-update;requirement;simulation	Daquan Feng;Guanding Yu;Yi Yuan-Wu;Geoffrey Ye Li;Gang Feng;Shaoqian Li	2014	2014 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)	10.1109/GlobalSIP.2014.7032331	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;computer science;distributed computing	Robotics	31.654487655559265	91.60148746127078	20505

77615fb17d87cb82e088ba2e11171ab2350dccce	energy efficiency optimization in ofdma heterogeneous networks with rf energy harvesting		In this paper, the power allocation problem, which aims to optimize the energy efficiency (EE) of downlink OFDMA heterogeneous networks, is researched. Specifically, the terminals are sensor nodes in the Internet of Things (IoT) with RF energy harvesting (EH) technology. This technology enables the sensor nodes to capture energy from the wireless signals in air, constitutes a permanent energy source, and provides self-stainability to them. Traditional interference analysis and EE modeling are unsuitable for our EH introduced problem, so we model the energy-efficient power allocation problem as an EH based non-cooperative (EHNC) game. Then we prove the existence and reveal the uniqueness conditions of the EHNC game equilibrium. We propose a distributed energy-efficient power allocation algorithm to solve the problem, and reveal that the game can converge to Nash equilibrium after certain times of iterations. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is effective in increasing energy-efficient performance, harvesting energy and guaranteeing QoS of the IoT sensor nodes simultaneously.	algorithm;converge;exception handling;exponential hierarchy;interference (communication);internet of things;iteration;mathematical optimization;memory management;nash equilibrium;optimization problem;quality of service;radio frequency;simulation;telecommunications link	Zhiqiang Chen;Xiangming Wen;Zhaoming Lu;Wenpeng Jing;Zeguo Xi;Kun Chen	2016	2016 IEEE 27th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2016.7794814	real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications	Embedded	30.621646230722828	91.47856956643484	20885

We then propose a state-based game formulation for the distributed AP association problem of the secondary users by taking the cost of mobility into account. We show that the state-based distributed AP association game has the finite improvement property, and design a distributed AP association algorithm can converge to a state-based Nash equilibrium. Numerical results show that the algorithm is robust to the perturbation by secondary users' dynamical leaving and entering the system.	converge;database;game theory;load balancing (computing);nash equilibrium;network planning and design;numerical analysis;numerical method;selection algorithm;white spaces (radio);wireless access point	Xu Chen;Jianwei Huang	2012	2012 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems	10.1109/ICDCS.2012.37	game theory;minimax;simulation;computer science;manganese;theoretical computer science;database;distributed computing;normal-form game;algorithmic game theory;nash equilibrium	Robotics	31.11609727333434	94.86927487484013	20922

A power minimization problem is examined for the various data rates and bit-error rate (BER) traffic. Lagrangian relaxation and a subcarrier timesharing factor are used to find an optimal solution. We propose an iterative algorithm to find optimal power consumption and a low complex suboptimal algorithm for practical implementation. The main contribution of this paper is that we apply the optimal solution obtained from the power minimization problem into the proposed algorithms. We execute extensive simulations under various multiclass service scenarios. These scenarios provide a more complete assessment of the proposed algorithms. Simulations results show that the proposed algorithms significantly outperform in total transmit power consumption compared to existing resource allocation algorithms.	algorithm;bit error rate;computer simulation;convex optimization;frequency divider;iterative method;lagrangian relaxation;linear programming relaxation;memory management;multi-user;multiplexing;quality of service;requirement;subcarrier;time-sharing;x.690	Jae Soong Lee;Jae Young Lee;Soobin Lee;Hwang Soo Lee	2008	2008 5th IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference		mathematical optimization;real-time computing;computer science;iterative method;statistics	Metrics	33.290543161209506	90.8177081860931	21120
80d9e4afc24ca9d9254a50f46c2be7edb1e659bc	cellular-connected uav: uplink association, power control and interference coordination		The line-of-sight (LoS) air-to-ground channel brings both opportunities and challenges in cellularconnected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications. On one hand, the LoS channels make more cellular base stations (BSs) visible to a UAV as compared to the ground users, which leads to a higher macro-diversity gain for UAV-BS communications. On the other hand, they also render the UAV to impose/suffer more severe uplink/downlink interference to/from the BSs, thus requiring more sophisticated inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC) techniques with more BSs involved. In this paper, we consider the uplink transmission from a UAV to cellular BSs, under spectrum sharing with the existing ground users. To investigate the optimal ICIC design and air-ground performance tradeoff, we maximize the weighted sum-rate of the UAV and existing ground users by jointly optimizing the UAV’s uplink cell associations and power allocations over multiple resource blocks. However, this problem is non-convex and difficult to be solved optimally. We first propose a centralized ICIC design to obtain a locally optimal solution based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) method. As the centralized ICIC requires global information of the network and substantial information exchange among an excessively large number of BSs, we further propose a decentralized ICIC scheme of significantly lower complexity and signaling overhead for implementation, by dividing the cellular BSs into smallsize clusters and exploiting the LoS macro-diversity for exchanging information between the UAV and cluster-head BSs only. Numerical results show that the proposed centralized and decentralized ICIC schemes both achieve a near-optimal performance, and draw important design insights based on practical system setups.

29476a774f70dcea997e1379fc36ee787441d76c	multiple service providers sharing spectrum using cognitive radio in wireless communication networks		The current utilization of the spectrum is quite inefficient; consequently, if properly used, there is no shortage of the spectrum that is at present available. Therefore, it is anticipated that more flexible use of spectrum and spectrum sharing between radio systems will be key enablers to facilitate the successful implementation of future systems. Cognitive radio, however, is known as the most intelligent and promising technique in solving the problem of spectrum sharing. In this paper, we consider the technique of spectrum sharing among users of service providers to share the licensed spectrum of licensed service providers. It is shown that the proposed technique reduces the call blocking rate and improves the spectrum utilization.	algorithm;blocking (computing);cognitive radio;complexity	R. Kaniezhil;C.

Our design aims to optimize the set of remote radio heads (RRHs) serving each user and the precoding and transmission power to minimize the total transmission power while maintaining the fronthaul capacity and users' quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. The fronthaul capacity constraint involves a nonconvex and discontinuous function that renders the optimal exhaustive search method unaffordable for large networks. To address this challenge, we propose two low-complexity algorithms. The first pricing-based algorithm solves the underlying problem through iteratively tackling a related pricing problem while appropriately updating the pricing parameter. In the second iterative linear-relaxed algorithm, we directly address the fronthaul constraint function by iteratively approximating it with a suitable linear form using a conjugate function and solving the corresponding convex problem. For performance evaluation, we also compare our proposed algorithms with two existing algorithms in the literature. Finally, extensive numerical results are presented, which illustrate the convergence of our proposed algorithms and confirm that our algorithms significantly outperform the state-of-the-art existing algorithms.	algorithm;brute-force search;constraint (mathematics);convex optimization;iterative method;multipoint ground;norm (social);numerical analysis;performance evaluation;quality of service;radio access network;remote radio head;rendering (computer graphics);telecommunications link	Nguyen-Ha Vu;Long Bao Le;Ngoc-Dung Dào	2016	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2015.2485668	pricing;mathematical optimization;quality of service;cloud computing;telecommunications;transmission;computer science;resource management;baseband;interference;iterative method;signal-to-noise ratio;computer network	Mobile	31.740232414469983	91.65987174306797	21550

A simple strategy for choosing the appropriate modulation and coding scheme according to the channel conditions of the assigned subcarriers is also proposed.	scheduling (computing)	Marco Cecchi;Romano Fantacci;Dania Marabissi;Daniele Tarchi	2008		10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.997	real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;computer network	Metrics	28.090504729046867	93.28279559071922	21612

However, channel estimation error (CEE) is inevitable and may cause obvious performance degradation for coordinated scheduling algorithms due to the inaccurate information. In this paper, a novel coordinated scheduling algorithm is proposed based on an adaptive CEE model for the uplink co-MIMO system. Based on a new defined CEE sensitivity criterion, users are divided into different groups and applied to different scheduling approaches. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms traditional coordinated scheduling algorithms in practical scenario with CEE. Furthermore, it can also achieve a better tradeoff between throughput and fairness compared to the robust user pairing algorithm.	algorithm;channel state information;elegant degradation;error detection and correction;fairness measure;floor and ceiling functions;ici (programming language);image scaling;interference (communication);mimo;scheduling (computing);simulation;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;throughput;tree structure	Siqi Liu;Jianyuan Cui;Jin Xu;Xiaofeng Tao	2016	2016 IEEE 27th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2016.7794948	real-time computing;distributed computing;computer network	Embedded	31.770999649892925	89.401814285953	21628
8c6bd2aba27c1ad5f611481778c39f533513455d	anti-shadowing resource allocation for general mobile cognitive radio networks		Resource allocation (RA) for mobile secondary users is considered one of the most important techniques for designing the next-generation cognitive radio network (CRN). In this paper, effective capacity (EC) is proposed to improve the RA performance for an underlay-based mobile CRN. By optimizing EC, an efficient resource allocation scheme is developed. First, we consider a moving secondary system, where the channel state information can be predicted by location-awareness techniques. According to the prediction result, we set protecting parameters for both the secondary and the primary performance targets to minimize the prediction error introduced by the decorrelated shadowing. Second, the computed sum average EC of the cognitive system is maximized. To solve the optimization RA problem, a low-complexity stepwise algorithm is proposed based on four procedures aimed at access, initialization, subchannel, and power. Moreover, the speeds of the primary users are taken into account, and a general system model is built. The corresponding resource allocation solutions can be induced easily through extending the originally proposed solution. Finally, simulation results are provided to confirm the EC-based algorithm. The proposed approach can not only improve the total secondary capacity but also achieve higher energy efficiency and spectrum efficiency for the mobile secondary system.	algorithm;artificial intelligence;channel state information;cognitive radio;digital subchannel;location awareness;mathematical optimization;self-shadowing;simulation;spectral efficiency;stepwise regression;traffic collision avoidance system	Miao Liu;Tiecheng Song;Jing Hu;Hikmet Sari;Guan Gui	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2792679	channel state information;cognitive radio;resource management;initialization;distributed computing;computer science;system model;mobile computing;resource allocation;spectral efficiency	Mobile	29.974755219219873	90.76097902986771	21897

We establish an information-theoretic lower bound on the capacity of feedback channel and build the corresponding test channel that achieves this lower bound. Based on the derived test channel, we formulate two optimization problems that maximize the downlink throughput with quantized channel state information (CSI): i) one problem where throughput is defined with the ergodic throughput and ii) the other problem with the outage throughput, from which we can see the performance limit for given limit feedback channels. We solve the throughput maximization problem through an iterative approach, which achieves the optimal ergodic throughput and the near-optimal outage throughput. Numerical results show that the downlink throughput with a limited feedback of CSI can be close to that with perfect CSI by exploiting correlation properties of downlink CSI for quantization.	channel capacity;channel state information;distortion;downtime;entropy maximization;ergodicity;expectation–maximization algorithm;feedback;information theory;iterative method;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;rate–distortion theory;resource description framework;subcarrier;telecommunications link;throughput	Chen Chen;Lin Bai;Bo Wu;Jinho Choi	2011	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2010.2080270	optimization problem;mathematical optimization;throughput;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications link;quantization;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;resource management;rdf;feedback;mathematics;iterative method;channel capacity	Mobile	35.72196178445687	88.65624741527492	21939

The complicated coupling between the mutual interferences of links gives rise to a non-convex optimization problem. Previous work has considered the WTM problem in the high signal to interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) regime, where the problem can be approximated and transformed into a convex optimization problem through proper change of variables. In the general SINR regime, however, the approximation and transformation approach does not work. This paper proposes an algorithm, MAPEL, which globally converges to a global optimal solution of the WTM problem in the general SINR regime. The MAPEL algorithm is designed based on three key observations of the WTM problem: (1) the objective function is monotonically increasing in SINR, (2) the objective function can be transformed into a product of exponentiated linear fraction functions, and (3) the feasible set of the equivalent transformed problem is always “normal” although not necessarily convex. The MAPLE algorithm finds the desired optimal power control solution by constructing a series of polyblocks that approximate the feasible SINR region in increasing precision. Furthermore, by tuning the approximation factor in MAPEL, we could engineer a desirable tradeoff between optimality and convergence time. MAPEL provides an important benchmark for performance evaluation of other heuristic algorithms targeting the same problem. With the help of MAPEL, we evaluate the performance of several respective algorithms through extensive simulations.

The present paper optimizes the design of transmit- and receive-beamformers for ad hoc CR networks when CR-to-CR channels are known, but CR-to-PU channels cannot be estimated accurately. Capitalizing on a norm-bounded channel uncertainty model, the optimal beamforming design is formulated to minimize the overall mean-square error (MSE) from all data streams, while enforcing protection of the PU system when the CR-to-PU channels are uncertain. Even though the resultant optimization problem is non-convex, algorithms with provable convergence to stationary points are developed by resorting to block coordinate ascent iterations, along with suitable convex approximation techniques. Enticingly, the novel schemes also lend themselves naturally to distributed implementations. Numerical tests are reported to corroborate the analytical findings.	algorithm;approximation;beamforming;cognitive radio;convex function;coordinate descent;hoc (programming language);ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);iteration;mimo;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;one-class classification;optimization problem;provable security;resultant;spatial multiplexing;stationary process;times ascent	Yu Zhang;Emiliano Dall'Anese;Georgios B.

A general framework is proposed to jointly optimize the energy efficiency (EE), spectral efficiency (SE), and queuing delay. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a stochastic optimization model aiming at maximizing the EE and SE concurrently under the network stability constraint, where subchannel allocation and power control are jointly optimized. Afterwards, with the help of Lyapunov techniques and weighted sum method, it is then transformed into a single-objective optimization problem, which is a mixed-integer and non-convex problem. Therefore, to solve this challenging subchannel allocation and power control problem with low computational complexity, we separate it into two levels of problems, and a two-stage iterative algorithm is proposed, which only requires polynomial computational complexity. Through theoretical analysis and numerical results, the effectiveness, convergence, and optimality of the proposed algorithm are validated.

17111035cb971a12a3ada2b4d1844d1dffb26190	pilot spoofing attack by multiple eavesdroppers		In this paper, we investigate the design of a pilot spoofing attack (PSA) carried out by multiple single-antenna eavesdroppers (Eves) in a downlink time-division duplex system, where a multiple antenna base station (BS) transmits confidential information to a single-antenna legitimate user. During the uplink channel training phase, multiple Eves collaboratively impair the channel acquisition of the legitimate link, aimed at maximizing the wiretapping signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the subsequent downlink data transmission phase. Two different scenarios are investigated: 1) the BS is unaware of the PSA and 2) the BS attempts to detect the presence of the PSA. For both scenarios, we formulate wiretapping SNR maximization problems. For the second scenario, we also investigate the probability of successful detection and constrain it to remain below a pre-designed threshold. The two resulting optimization problems can be unified into a more general non-convex optimization problem, and we propose an efficient algorithm based on the minorization–maximization (MM) method and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve it. The proposed MM-ADMM algorithm is shown to converge to a stationary point of the general problem. In addition, we propose a semi-definite relaxation (SDR) method as a benchmark to evaluate the efficiency of the MM-ADMM algorithm. Numerical results show that the MM-ADMM algorithm achieves near-optimal performance and is computationally more efficient than the SDR-based method.	approximation algorithm;augmented lagrangian method;benchmark (computing);confidentiality;converge;convex optimization;convex set;duplex (telecommunications);etsi satellite digital radio;emoticon;eve;expectation–maximization algorithm;iteration;linear programming relaxation;mm algorithm;mathematical optimization;numerical method;optimization problem;polar surface area;semiconductor industry;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spoofing attack;stationary process;telecommunications link	Ke-Wen Huang;Hui-Ming Wang;Yongpeng Wu;Robert Schober	2018	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2018.2859949	real-time computing;mathematics;data transmission;spoofing attack;telecommunications link;maximization;base station;communication channel;optimization problem;signal-to-noise ratio	ML	37.414900446725596	89.87003666217977	23120

Specifically, the horizontal location, vertical location, coverage radius and the functional split scheme selection of UAVs are jointly optimized. Both the user data rate and the total delay consisting of baseband processing and fron-transmission are guaranteed. To reduce the optimization complexity, we further derive the upper and lower bounds of the optimal number of UAVs. Numerical results show that, with flexible functional split, the energy consumption of UAVs can be considerably reduced compared with fixed functional split. We also observe that more baseband functions should be placed at the UAV side when the distance between the UAV and the baseband units (BBU) on the ground is larger,	aerial photography;baseband;data rate units;mathematical optimization;numerical method;software deployment;unmanned aerial vehicle	Liumeng Wang;Sheng Zhou	2018	2018 IEEE 19th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)	10.1109/SPAWC.2018.8445959	software deployment;electronic engineering;real-time computing;energy consumption;efficient energy use;upper and lower bounds;baseband;computer science	Embedded	29.943790098424095	90.70902346867156	23221

To achieve the above goal, usually a secondary user periodically senses a spectrum band, and once an idle period is detected, the secondary user sends data in a transmission time. Due to (i) miss-detection of busy periods or (ii) unpredictable arrivals of busy periods, a secondary user may send data in busy periods, which causes useless data transmission. A secondary user usually cares about effective throughput which excludes the useless transmitted data. In order to alleviate the useless data transmission and enhance effective throughput, we consider dividing one long data transmission into two or more smaller data transmissions. Analyses, which are verified by simulations, are developed in this paper to calculate effective throughput in a periodic sensing structure with sensing errors. We use the analyses to select a set of parameters of sensing and transmission such that effective throughput is maximized at a certain load while the interference is below a pre-determined level. Besides, we study two policies, namely, fixed parameter policy and dynamic parameter policy, to maximize effective throughput in a spectrum band with variable loads; the former policy selects and applies one fixed set of parameters to different loads, but the latter policy uses different sets of parameters in different loads respectively. Numerical results show that the dynamic parameter policy outperforms the fixed parameter policy.	cognitive radio;expectation–maximization algorithm;throughput	Show-Shiow Tzeng;Ching-Wen Huang	2011	Wireless Networks	10.1007/s11276-011-0331-1	cognitive radio;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	27.432663703156077	97.33983164633281	23281

For such a network, assuming that the second-order statistics of the channel coefficients are available, we study two different beamforming design approaches. As the first approach, we design the beamformer through minimization of the total transmit power subject to the receiver quality of service constraint. We show that this approach yields a closed-form solution. In the second approach, the beamforming weights are obtained through maximizing the receiver signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) subject to two different types of power constraints, namely the total transmit power constraint and individual relay power constraints. We show that the total power constraint leads to a closed-form solution while the individual relay power constraints result in a quadratic programming optimization problem. The later optimization problem does not have a closed-form solution. However, it is shown that using semidefinite relaxation, this problem can be turned into a convex feasibility semidefinite programming (SDP), and therefore, can be efficiently solved using interior point methods. Furthermore, we develop a simplified, thus suboptimal, technique which is computationally more efficient than the SDP approach. In fact, the simplified algorithm provides the beamforming weight vector in a closed form. Our numerical examples show that as the uncertainty in the channel state information is increased, satisfying the quality of service constraint becomes harder, i.e., it takes more power to satisfy these constraints. Also our simulation results show that when compared to the SDP-based method, our simplified technique suffers a 2-dB loss in SNR for low to moderate values of transmit power.	algorithm;beamforming;channel state information;coefficient;computational complexity theory;interior point method;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimization problem;quadratic programming;quality of service;relaxation (approximation);relay;semidefinite programming;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;transmitter	Veria Havary-Nassab;Shahram Shahbazpanahi;Ali Grami;Zhi-Quan Luo	2008	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2008.925945	mathematical optimization;transmitter;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;quadratic programming;statistics;semidefinite programming	EDA	36.76823351160359	88.88070577668806	23301

As a result, significant research efforts are being recently devoted towards energy efficient wireless communications. The use of relay nodes that enhance coverage/capacity in wireless systems has been identified as a means to improve energy efficiency thanks to the associated reduction in transmit power. In this context, this paper presents the assessment of the energy savings that can be achieved by means of relaying in a wireless system. As a difference from prior works where the impact of relaying on energy efficiency is obtained as a result of multiple aggregated effects, the analysis performed in this paper will highlight, separately, the role played by each of the key elements influencing on the performance, such as the propagation and shadowing effects, the energy consumption model parameters and the influence of the bit rate and spectral efficiency.	relay;software deployment;software propagation;spectral efficiency	Jordi Pérez-Romero;Oriol Sallent;Ramón Agustí	2014	2014 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)	10.1109/EuCNC.2014.6882645	cognitive radio;electronic engineering;wireless wan;telecommunications;engineering;radio resource management;wireless network;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;fixed wireless;computer network	Mobile	24.647491050390308	90.30895739730845	23455

Relay-enabled cellular networks, marked by their adoption in IEEE 802.16j standard, have become a viable candidate in such an endeavor. Such relay networks not only provide multi-user and (OFDM) channel diversity gains that are available in conventional cellular systems, but also provide spatial reuse gains, arising from the simultaneous transmissions on different hops of the network on the same channel. However, the efficient exploitation of these gains, calls for intelligent scheduler design at the BS that must not only accommodate the multi-hop nature of the network, but also address the resulting significant overhead incurred in the form of feedback. In this work, we present relay-assistedscheduling algorithms that efficiently exploit the available diversity and spatial reuse gains at the cost ofminimalfeedback overhead.The proposed solutions improve performance over conventional approaches by over 50% along with a scalable feedback overhead that grows only with the number of relays in the network and not with the number of users.

In this paper, the problem of resource allocation for heterogeneous users in an underlay CR network is addressed. The objective is to maximize the weighted sum of the data rate for all the categories of secondary users within the network. The problem is first formulated as a non-linear optimization problem which is non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP) hard. The problem is then cleverly re-formulated as an integer linear programming problem and solved through branch-and-bound method. The impact of the weights on the different categories of users is also investigated. The results obtained show that through the approach developed by the authors, optimal resource allocation is achievable for heterogeneous CR networks.	care-of address;cognitive radio;data rate units;integer programming;linear programming;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;optimization problem;time complexity;weight function	Babatunde S.

A joint cell, channel and power allocation problem is formulated as an overall optimization problem, where the objective is to maximize the minimum user throughput. Based on previous complexity results for the setting without relays, the overall optimization problem is shown not to be approximable, unless P is equal to NP. We propose a method for solving this challenging problem. First, a feasible cell allocation is obtained, either via greedy allocation or an exhaustive search. Thereafter, the channel and power allocations are alternately updated, either using a heuristic or optimization-based approach while holding the other two allocations fixed. These alternating channel and power allocations are repeated until no further improvement is obtained. The impact of relay stations is investigated by considering a model with relays as well as one without relays. The simulations show that substantial performance improvement can be made by introducing relays. They also indicate, somewhat surprisingly, that the heuristic channel allocation leads to better overall solutions than the corresponding optimization approach in the relay setting. The optimization-based power allocation significantly outperforms the heuristic power approach with as well as without relay stations.	algorithmic efficiency;broadcast relay station;brute-force search;computation;decision problem;distributed algorithm;greedy algorithm;heuristic;iteration;iterative method;mathematical optimization;np-hardness;optimization problem;program optimization;rendering (computer graphics);simulation;throughput	Mikael Fallgren	2012	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2012.062012.111616	mathematical optimization;transmitter;throughput;telecommunications;numerical analysis;computer science;resource management;np-hard	AI	33.92818733756606	91.80210803761288	24395
65bbabe300ccc2e8dc9b4a17d5fe680c80392a05	full-duplex relaying for d2d communication in millimeter wave-based 5g networks		Device-to-device (D2D) communication, which can offload data from base stations by direct transmission between mobile devices, is a promising technology for fifth generation (5G) wireless networks. However, the limited battery capacity of mobile devices is a barrier to fully exploiting the benefits of D2D communication. Meanwhile, high data rate D2D communication is required to support the increasing traffic demand of emerging applications. In this paper, we study relay-assisted D2D communication in millimeter wave (mmWave)-based 5G networks to address these issues. Multiple D2D user pairs are assisted by full-duplex relays that are equipped with directional antennas. To design an efficient relay selection and power allocation scheme, we formulate a multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem, which balances the trade-off between total transmit power and system throughput. The problem is transformed into a weighted bipartite matching problem. We then propose a centralized relay selection and power allocation algorithm and prove that it can achieve a Pareto optimal solution in polynomial time. We further propose a distributed algorithm based on stable matching. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithms substantially reduce the total transmit power and improve the system throughput compared with two existing algorithms in the literature.	binary logarithm;centralized computing;combinatorial optimization;convex function;convex optimization;data rate units;distributed algorithm;duplex (telecommunications);fifth generation computer;first-order predicate;interference (communication);matching (graph theory);mathematical optimization;mobile device;multi-objective optimization;one-to-one (data model);optimization problem;overhead (computing);pareto efficiency;polynomial;relay;requirement;rewrite (programming);simulation;stable marriage problem;throughput;time complexity	Bojiang Ma;Hamed Shah-Mansouri;Vincent W.

b9c135b937eaab74aa675e917715dd8b03ccef30	load balancing for 5g ultra-dense networks using device-to-device communications		Load balancing is an effective approach to address the spatial–temporal fluctuation problem of mobile data traffic for cellular networks. The existing schemes that focus on channel borrowing from neighboring cells cannot be directly applied to the future 5G wireless networks, because the neighboring cells will reuse the same spectrum band in 5G systems. In this paper, we consider an orthogonal frequency division multiple access ultra-dense small cell network, where device-to-device (D2D) communication is advocated to facilitate load balancing without extra spectrum. Specifically, the data traffic can be effectively offloaded from a congested small cell to other underutilized small cells by D2D communications. The problem is naturally formulated as a joint resource allocation and D2D routing problem that maximizes the system sum-rate. To efficiently solve the problem, we decouple the problem into a resource allocation subproblem and a D2D routing subproblem. The two subproblems are solved iteratively as a monotonic optimization problem and a complementary geometric programming problem, respectively. Simulation results show that the data sum-rate in the neighboring small cells increases 20% on average by offloading the data traffic in the congested small cell to the neighboring small cell base stations.	approximation algorithm;data rate units;expanded memory;frequency divider;geometric programming;iterative method;johnson–nyquist noise;load balancing (computing);mathematical optimization;optimization problem;quantum fluctuation;routing;simulation;smart battery system;social inequality;traffic collision avoidance system	Hongliang Zhang;Lingyang Song;Ying Jun Angela Zhang	2018	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2018.2819648	computer network;wireless network;orthogonal frequency-division multiple access;load balancing (computing);mathematics;load management;cellular network;resource allocation;optimization problem;communication channel	Mobile	30.195318030276944	92.11938464201077	24892

This has led to an almost fully assigned but sparsely and unevenly used spectrum, in which it is becoming more difficult to accommodate the increasing demand of wireless communication. This work presents a general view of automated spectrum trading, one of the mechanisms proposed to improve spectrum efficiency. Licensed operators would be able to lease their unused bandwidth to unlicensed ones in secondary markets, satisfying real time demands from users. This results in a higher and more dynamic use of spectrum while providing incentives to spectrum owners for allowing secondary users to access their unused spectrum. Several approaches can be found in this research area combining game theory, economic models and auction design, among others. We describe and organize the main objectives and challenges of spectrum trading, and present a comprehensive classification and explanation of the existing research lines, showing how different works addressed each relevant issue, discussing the benefits and drawbacks of each approach. Finally, we highlight future research trends in this topic and identify critical but possibly overlooked problems.		Mario Lopez-Martinez;Juan J.

f7edc636b4a5eb57c4a47582e54ae67ef2da9a89	radio resource management for lte-a relay-enhanced cells with spatial reuse and max-min fairness		One of the major issues in LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) systems is the poor capacity at the cell edge. This is mainly due to the interference experienced by the users as a result of the aggressive frequency reuse usually implemented. Relaying offers an attractive solution for this problem by offering better links than those with the eNodeB (eNB) for the terminals suffering from high path loss or high interference. However, adding relays complicates the resource allocation problem at the eNB and therefore the need for more efficient schemes arises. This is also aggravated by the reuse of resource blocks (RBs) by the relays to fully exploit the scarce spectrum, which, in turn, leads to intra-cell interference. In this paper, we study the joint power and resource allocation problem in LTE-A relay-enhanced cells that exploit spatial reuse. To guarantee fairness among users, a max–min fair optimization objective is used. This complex problem is solved using coordinate ascent and the difference of two convex functions (DC) programming techniques and the proposed scheme indeed converges to a local-optimum quickly. This is shown to be a satisfactory solution according to the simulation results that indicate an almost sevenfold increase in the 10th percentile capacity when compared to previously proposed solutions.	compaq lte;fairness measure;max-min fairness;maxima and minima;radio resource management;relay	Omar A.

The robust problem aims to minimize the transmission power of relay nodes while the imperfect channel information (CSI) injects stochastic channel uncertainties to the parameters of optimization problem. In the power minimization framework, the relays amplification weights and phases are optimized assuming the availability of Gaussian channel distribution. The power sum of all relays is minimized while the outage probability of the instantaneous capacity (or SINR) at each link is above the outage capacity (or SINR) for each user. The robust problem is a nonconvex SDP problem with Rank constraint. Due to the nonconvexity of the original problem, three suboptimal problems are proposed. Simulation and numerical results are presented to compare the performance of the three proposed solutions with the existing worst case robust method.	downtime;multi-user	Behrad Mahboobi;Ehsan Soleimani-Nasab;Mehrdad Ardebilipour	2014	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-013-1520-2	mathematical optimization;penalty method;control theory;mathematics;relay channel	Mobile	37.05999041834909	89.57778302596434	25566
806aa95f38404ea1d744fabf61a8f60111aae330	user association and backhaul bandwidth allocation for 5g heterogeneous networks in the millimeter-wave band		User association and wireless backhaul allocation in a two-tier heterogeneous network (HetNet) operating in the millimeter wave (mmWave) band is investigated. The macro cell tier base station (BS) is assumed to be equipped with large-scale antenna arrays, while the small cell BSs only have single-antenna capability and they rely on the wireless link to the macro BS for backhaul. To balance the throughput and the fairness, the sum of logarithmic user rate is chosen as the network utility for the optimization problem. A distributed algorithm based on hierarchical primal and dual decomposition is proposed. Firstly, the primal decomposition transforms the original problem into two sub-problems, the wireless backhaul bandwidth allocation subproblem and the user association subproblem. Secondly, biasing on the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is introduced to the small cell tier to achieve traffic offloading. Finally, the optimal solution X∗ for the user association subproblem can be obtained from the Lagrange dual function through the dual decomposition when the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition or the Slater's condition holds. While achieving the same optimal performance, the proposed distributed algorithm converges much faster than the exhaustive search method. Simulation results reveal that the system throughput is improved as we increase the large-scale antenna array size and the number of users. The impact of changing the number of small cell BSs is insignificant. In addition, the system throughput achieved by the distributed algorithm outperforms that of the conventional maximum SINR based user association strategy.	backhaul (telecommunications);biasing;brute-force search;computation;computational complexity theory;distributed algorithm;duality (optimization);fairness measure;interference (communication);karush–kuhn–tucker conditions;lagrangian relaxation;mathematical optimization;maximal set;multitier architecture;network utility;optimization problem;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;slater's condition;throughput;time complexity;tucker decomposition	Zhenxiang Su;Bo Ai;Danping He;Guo-Yu Ma;Ke Guan;Ning Wang;Dongying Zhang	2017	2017 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)	10.1109/ICCChina.2017.8330352	throughput;computer network;distributed algorithm;antenna array;network utility;computer science;heterogeneous network;backhaul (telecommunications);base station;bandwidth allocation	Mobile	31.24246950473824	92.62222823182744	25742
416f8bd29092f46e76e59d18100f6ebce6cfea94	stochastic differential games and energy-efficient power control		One of the contributions of this work is to formulate the problem of energy-efficient power control in multiple access channels (namely, channels which comprise several transmitters and one receiver) as a stochastic differential game. The players are the transmitters who adapt their power level to the quality of their time-varying link with the receiver, their battery level, and the strategy updates of the others. The proposed model not only allows one to take into account long-term strategic interactions but also long-term energy constraints. A simple sufficient condition for the existence of a Nash equilibrium in this game is provided and shown to be verified in a typical scenario. As the uniqueness and determination of equilibria are difficult issues in general, especially when the number of players goes large, we move to two special cases: the single player case which gives us some useful insights of practical interest and allows one to make connections with the case of large number of players. The latter case is treated with a mean-field game approach for which reasonable sufficient conditions for convergence and uniqueness are provided. Remarkably, this recent approach for large system analysis shows how scalability can be dealt with in large games and only relies on the individual state information assumption.	interaction;nash equilibrium;scalability;system analysis;transmitter	François Mériaux;Samson Lasaulce;Hamidou Tembine	2013	Dynamic Games and Applications	10.1007/s13235-012-0068-1	mathematical optimization;repeated game;mathematics;stochastic game;screening game;mathematical economics;equilibrium selection	ECom	33.59284672147598	95.09138680746992	25781

Based on the wireless multi-hop relay technology, the backhaul network capacity of 5G ultra-dense cellular networks with multi-gateways is analyzed in this paper. Moreover, a minimum average hop number (MAN) algorithm is developed to improve the backhaul network capacity and energy efficiency of wireless backhaul networks for 5G ultra-dense cellular networks. Simulation results indicate there exist a stationary backhaul network capacity and a maximum energy efficiency of wireless backhaul networks when the density of small cell BSs is larger than the specified threshold.	algorithm;backhaul (telecommunications);existential quantification;expectation propagation;relay;simulation;stationary process	Xiaohu Ge;Linghui Pan;Song Tu;Hsiao-Hwa Chen;Cheng-Xiang Wang	2016	2016 IEEE 84th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2016.7881969	cellular network;electronic engineering;wireless wan;logic gate;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;wireless network;wireless;computer network	Mobile	24.80472851350641	90.64060531387557	25791

However, due to users' mutual interference, this problem is in general non-convex and thus cannot be solved directly by conventional convex optimization techniques. In this paper, by jointly utilizing the monotonic optimization and rate profile techniques, we develop a new approach to obtain the globally optimal power control solution to the WSR maximization problem for the GIC with single-antenna transmitters and receivers. Different from prior work, this paper proposes to maximize the WSR in the achievable rate region of the GIC directly by exploiting the facts that the achievable rate region is a “normal” set and the users' WSR is a “strictly increasing” function over the rate region. Consequently, the WSR maximization problem belongs to the class of monotonic optimization over a normal set and thus can be solved globally optimally by the outer polyblock approximation algorithm. However, an essential step in this algorithm hinges on how to efficiently characterize the intersection point on the Pareto boundary of the achievable rate region with any prescribed “rate profile” vector. This paper shows that such a problem can be transformed into a sequence of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) feasibility problems, which can be solved efficiently by existing techniques. Furthermore, this paper sheds some lights on how the proposed algorithm can be applied to solve WSR maximization problems for the multi-antenna GICs.	approximation algorithm;convex optimization;decision problem;entropy maximization;expectation–maximization algorithm;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;multi-user;pareto efficiency;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation interoperability standards organization;soft-in soft-out decoder;system analysis;transmitter;waist-to-height ratio;weight function	Liang Liu;Rui Zhang;Kee Chaing Chua	2011	2011 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2011.6096937	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	37.26022733331643	90.14450245285337	25980

Each user in the network intends to obtain a higher rate from the BS for its own data transmission (e.g., pictures or videos downloading), but the total transmission resource is limited at the BS. Thus, we formulated this resource allocation problem as an auction game, where the BS acts as the auctioneer and the users are the bidders. We then propose a novel joint subcarrier and power allocation algorithm using distributed auction game, in order to allocate the limited subcarriers and power effectively and maximize the total transmission rate subject to an overall power constraint with low-complexity and fairness. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed auction-based algorithm.	algorithm;download;fairness measure;game mechanics;mimo-ofdm;multi-user;multiuser dos;simulation;subcarrier	Rongqing Zhang;Lingyang Song;Zhu Han;Zhongshan Zhang;Bingli Jiao	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-23490-3_39	auction algorithm;real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications	AI	31.85196664461711	94.11764147842747	26063

Switching off specific BS entirely however, can lead to coverage holes and severe performance degradation. To avoid coverage holes, the transmit power of neighbouring BS must be commensurately increased, which can cause higher interference to other cell users. Recently a BS-RS (relay station) switching model has been proposed where the BS changes operating mode to a RS during off-peak periods rather than being completely turned off. This paper presents a traffic-aware and traffic-and-interference aware switching strategy for both the BS sleeping and BS-RS switching paradigms, which dynamically establishes the conditions for a BS to alter its working mode. The switching is based upon a dynamic traffic threshold allied with the received BS interference level. Analysis corroborates both new algorithms significantly improve network energy efficiency, while upholding the requisite quality of service provision.	algorithm;broadcast relay station;catastrophic interference;digital television adapter;elegant degradation;interference (communication);load profile;packet switching;quality of service;reed–solomon error correction;throughput	A.

8b04da7c47ab71e45d329ec2a86d5eb83ab1b362	cooperative spectrum sharing based on contract theory with optimal bandwidth and power allocation		In this paper, we proposed a cooperative spectrum sharing strategy based on contract theory with optimal power and bandwidth allocation. Specifically, primary user (PU) and secondary users (SUs) act as the employer and employees like labor consumption market, respectively. SUs provide labor, i.e. the relay power used for forwarding the PU's signal, in exchange for the reward, i.e. the spectrum accessing bandwidth for transmitting their own signals. PU needs to overcome a challenge how to balance the relationship between contributions and incentives for SUs. We designed an optimal contract with joint power and bandwidth optimization. We study how to allocate the power and bandwidth to maximize primary user's utility. Simulation results confirm that the utility of the primary user is significantly enhanced with our proposed cooperative spectrum sharing strategy.	bandwidth (signal processing);computer simulation;ibm systems network architecture;mathematical optimization;personally identifiable information;relay;transmitter	Chenxin He;Weidang Lu;Hong Peng;Zhijiang Xu;Xin Liu	2017	2017 13th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2017.7986311	computer network;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer science;incentive;contract theory;relay;bandwidth (signal processing);bandwidth allocation;resource allocation	Mobile	31.935445388128947	94.98651973695817	26363

The ICIC provided in this paper gives a proper inter-cell resource allocation by employing the concept of interference avoidance and describes the inter-relationship of all base stations in a holistic way. We use a semi-centralized ICIC scheme which divides the global optimum problem into a multicell and multi-user problem. Our performance metrics are the aggregate sector throughput and the critical throughput of a multi-cell system. The critical throughput is defined as the 5th percentile of the aggregate user throughput. Simulation results confirm the increased effectiveness of the proposed ICIC in both metrics over a number of state-of-the-art interference avoidance schemes.

Given the inherent volatility of the wireless channel, the accurate estimation of channel conditions and the adoption of sophisticated adaptation techniques is required, so that transmission parameters are selected based on link quality, and user throughput is maximized. In this paper we consider a simple wireless link monitoring method, which is based on counting positive and negative acknowledgments (ACKs and NACKs), and we investigate the class of adaptation policies that correspond to this method. The policy that maximizes the long-term throughput efficiency of a user is shown to be of threshold type. Due to inherent difficulties in realization of this policy, a suboptimal heuristic method to perform link adaptation is provided. Our results indicate a considerable improvement in link throughput under such adaptive techniques.

Resource allocation mechanisms in LTE are very critical issues, because scheduling algorithms have the main responsibility for determining how to allocate radio resources for different users. In this paper a dynamically adapted Proportional Fair (PF) scheduling algorithm for capacity enhancement of LTE system is proposed. Performance comparison with the conventional PF downlink scheduler, which is characterized by high fairness but with low throughput, and the Best-Channel Quality Indicator( Best-CQI) scheduling algorithm which is characterized by high throughput but with poor fairness performance is presented. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm enhances the overall system capacity and also provides fairness in the distribution of the resources. The proposed algorithm improves the average cell throughput by more than 31 %, with a slight degradation in the fairness level as compared with the conventional Proportional Fair PF scheduling algorithm.	access network;algorithm;channel capacity;compaq lte;elegant degradation;fair-share scheduling;fairness measure;multiplexing;pf (firewall);proportionally fair;scheduling (computing);simulation;telecommunications link;throughput	Mohammed Abd-Elnaby;Mohamad Elhadad;S.

Technology based layers like the PHY and MAC layer are developed considering assumptions and constraints on the service and application layers. The coexistence of several wireless transmission links operated by different users or operators requires interference coordination on the PHY and MAC. Bilateral agreements or policies consider business aspects and regulatory specifications. In this context, models from multiuser information theory are combined with microeconomic models. There are several connections between both areas: the utility functions and capacities or achievable rates, the strategy spaces and resources or coding schemes, the budget sets and the constraints on powers or rates. In this paper, we focus on one market equilibrium, the Walras equilibrium, and develop a distributed algorithm which finds an efficient operating point for three representative interference channel models: power allocation and single user decoding, beamforming and single user decoding, and rate splitting with successive decoding.	beamforming;coexist (image);distributed algorithm;end-user license agreement;information theory;interference (communication);mandatory access control;multi-user;nash equilibrium;operating point;phy (chip);protocol stack;shannon (unit);telecommunications network	Eduard Axel Jorswieck;Rami Mochaourab	2013	2013 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)	10.1109/ITA.2013.6502945	telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;computer network	Mobile	32.48433079583079	92.81199414582552	27144

Network capacity is without doubt a critical resource for LTE networks. At the same time, real-time multimedia transmission requires effective quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning, as well as power admission. This paper proposes a traffic-aware OFDMA hybrid small-cell deployment for QoS provisioning and an optimal power admission control strategy for 4G cellular systems. By performing real-case scenario simulations of user-type multimedia transmission, we show that the implemented framework achieves high QoS levels of performance, increased throughput capacity, lower delay levels and optimally adapted network traffic.	compaq lte;control theory;network traffic control;provisioning;quality of service;real-time clock;simulation;software deployment;throughput	Antonios G.

The PRX selects a power allocation (PA) for the secondary user that maximizes the secondary rate (and thus its revenue) and enforces it by the following mechanism: Upon violation of a predefined interference level, PRX keeps silencing randomly selected secondary users, until the aggregate secondary interference is below the required threshold. This mechanism ensures that secondary users may not be willing to deviate from the allocated PA. Specifically, the scenario gives rise to a Stackelberg game, in which the primary determines the PA and a Nash equilibrium (NE) constraint is imposed on the PA to ensure that secondary users do not have incentives to deviate, given their knowledge of the silencing mechanism run at the PRX. In principle, the primary should find the set of all PAs that are NE and among them choose the one that maximizes the aggregate secondary utility, and thereby the revenue of the primary. For the most general setting of channel gains, we investigate the conditions for NE for a subset of PAs. When the scenario is symmetric in the sense that all secondary users have the same channel gains in the direct/interfering links, we prove that only two optimal power allocations exist. Finally, for the case of general channel gains with strong interference, we show that there is a unique NE of the game.	aggregate data;catastrophic interference;existential quantification;interference (communication);nash equilibrium;prx (telephony);randomized algorithm;randomness	Rocco Di Taranto;Petar Popovski;Osvaldo Simeone;Hiroyuki Yomo	2010	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2010.092810.091799	games;game theory;spectrum;transmitter;cognitive radio;simulation;telecommunications;power control;computer science;resource management;interference;radio receiver;signal-to-noise ratio;stackelberg competition;nash equilibrium	ECom	32.02775516842803	95.50235863689252	27575

In resource allocation for a D2D video transmission system in a block fading environment, the performance improvement by applying the exact symbol error rate (SER) is compared with the conventional signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) based SER evaluation method that uses a Gaussian approximation (GA) for the aggregated interference. An analytical SER expression for a D2D system using multicarrier bandlimited QAM is derived and then used in the resource allocation algorithm. Centralized resource allocation for the D2D system is considered, given knowledge of the channel state information and the rate distortion information of the video streams, and an iterative algorithm for subcarrier assignment and power allocation is proposed. Bit-level simulations for different numbers of D2D pairs demonstrate a considerable improvement on user capacity and video peak signal-to-noise ratio by incorporating the proposed SER expression compared to the GA. By invoking the conditions under which the central limit theorem holds, and comparing these conditions with the number of interferers and the power ratio of the dominant interferer in the simulated D2D system, the reason why the GA for the interference results in a pessimistic performance is also studied.Resource allocation algorithms for D2D video transmission with a filter bank multicarrier waveform in a Rayleigh fading environment are investigated. The co-channel interference between D2D pairs is analyzed, and a cross-layer algorithm with a subcarrier assignment outer loop and a power control inner loop, which aims to optimize the overall video quality, is proposed. Unlike the non-convexity in physical layer power control for maximizing the total throughput, the cross-layer power control problem is convex under certain conditions, so a high quality solution for power control can be efficiently found. Simulation results demonstrate a higher overall video quality by the proposed cross-layer algorithm compared to baseline algorithms.	profiling (computer programming)	Peizhi Wu	2016			electronic engineering;simulation;telecommunications;computer science	Metrics	33.26752754102606	89.76441374934045	27687

In this paper, we study the downlink resource allocation problem of two-tier macrocell–femtocell networks. We first formulate the problem as a Mixed Integer Non-Linear Program (MINLP) which aims to maximize the capacity of clustered femtocell networks subject to hard delay constraints of flows with different priorities. Next, we build $$(\rho (\theta ),\sigma (\theta ))$$ ( ρ ( θ ) , σ ( θ ) ) arrival model for the traffics and apply Stochastic Network Calculus (SNC) to transforming the delay constraints into alternative minimum transmission rate requirements, then we propose a resource allocation algorithm called S-SAPCS to solve the MINLP. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has near-optimal performance. We also design a scheme based on deterministic network calculus to show that S-SAPCS is able to exploit the statistical multiplexing gain among multiple flows, which improves the throughput significantly.	algorithm;linear programming;multiplexing;multitier architecture;network calculus;queueing theory;requirement;sap netweaver;simulation;telecommunications link;throughput	Xin Chen;Yuan Si;Xudong Xiang	2015	The Journal of Supercomputing	10.1007/s11227-015-1494-9	mathematical optimization;real-time computing;max-min fairness;resource allocation;computer science;distributed computing;femtocell	Metrics	27.847159806813984	93.09781718159053	27743

In this paper we explore spatial resources coordination as a key empowering technology for next generation (5G) ultra-dense networks. We propose an optimization framework for flexibly associating system users with access nodes in a densely deployed network, opting for the exploitation of densification and the control of overhead signaling. Combined with spatial precoding strategies, network resources management approaches are designed, reflecting various features, namely local vs. global channel state information knowledge exploitation, centralized vs. distributed implementation, and non-cooperative vs. joint multi-node data processing. We apply these strategies to future dense network setups, and explore the impact of critical network parameters, that is, the densification levels of access nodes, the density of users requesting service, and the power budget constraints. We demonstrate that spatial resources coordination is a key factor for capitalizing on the gains of ultra dense network deployments.	backhaul (telecommunications);centralized computing;channel state information;cluster analysis;image scaling;mathematical optimization;next-generation network;overhead (computing);requirement	Antonis G.

The performance of the whole cellular network is improved by contracting and shaping the antenna radiation pattern around traffic """"hot spots"""" and expanding adjacent cell coverage to fill in the coverage loss. The paper shows that the local area real time cooperative negotiation between base stations leads to a near global optimal coverage agreement which is reached in the context of the whole cellular network. Results showing the advantage of this technique are presented. Global optimization using constrained real-coded genetic algorithms provides the benchmark. In our work, instead of using a formal negotiation model of alternating offers, we create certain number of possible local hypotheses and start negotiations based on them. Some negotiation may reach agreements before their deadlines, and the system commits to the best agreement found at the end. This approach is more predictable and controllable than the formal negotiation model. Architecturally the negotiation component described is part of the planning layer of an agent system for resource management in 3G wireless networks. This has a layered architecture with both planning and reactive components. The results are allowing the development of a novel geographic load-balancing scheme for cellular networks that intelligently changes cellular coverage according to the geographic traffic distribution in real time."""	benchmark (computing);genetic algorithm;global optimization;load balancing (computing);mathematical optimization;mobile phone;multi-agent system;noise shaping;radiation pattern;real-time transcription	John Bigham;Lin Du	2003		10.1145/860575.860666	real-time computing;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;load balancing;multi-agent system;distributed computing	AI	26.866015204526143	91.02098959480945	28054
ba230b1dc67d2da2eee959c68d47df73e316c663	analysis of a semi blind pilot decontamination method in massive mimo		Recently, a semi-blind pilot decontamination based method is proposed in [1] for multicell multiuser massive multiinput multioutput (MIMO) systems. In [1], to reduce the effect of the pilot contamination, a semiblind channel estimation method that does not require cell cooperation or statistical information of the channels is proposed. The blind pilot decontamination method in [1] is reformulated as a constrained optimization problem. The constrained minimization problem of the mixing matrix is then carried out by a generalized robust independent component analysis (ICA) based deflation method. The key demerit of the proposed deflation method is that it suffers from error accumulation. In this paper, we investigate semi blind pilot decontamination method in [1] aiming to analyze the role of the deflation technique used in this method. Our analysis reveals that the error accumulation is a major drawback found in this algorithm. Furthermore, the overall performance improves without the deflation method in the semi blind pilot decontamination. The effectiveness of our analysis is verified by extensive simulations considering different noise levels.	algorithm;blind signature;channel state information;computational complexity theory;constrained optimization;constraint (mathematics);elegant degradation;image noise;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;mimo;mathematical optimization;multi-user;noise (electronics);optimization problem;pilot ace;semiconductor industry;simulation;tree accumulation	Nusrat Fatema;Yong Xiang;Iynkaran Natgunanathan	2017	2017 27th International Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference (ITNAC)	10.1109/ATNAC.2017.8215368	mimo;mathematical optimization;deconvolution;human decontamination;independent component analysis;constrained optimization;matrix (mathematics);communication channel;computer science	EDA	38.56648952009441	91.23232982042855	28324

In this paper, an optimum and efficient RRM algorithm is proposed for Long Term Evolution-Advanced with reduced complexity and compared with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) solutions. The proposed algorithm optimally assigns component carriers, resource blocks, and modulation and coding scheme values to users, based on their channel state information and CA capabilities. Most of the SOTA solutions are based on approximate approaches that have much inferior performance compared to the performance of our proposed optimal solution. Furthermore, performance of the proposed solution has been evaluated using system-level simulations, and results show clearly that the proposed algorithm outperforms the SOTA algorithms in terms of fairness throughput and average cell throughput.	approximation algorithm;channel state information;compaq lte;fairness measure;modulation;radio resource management;simulation;throughput	Soheil Rostami;Kamran Arshad;Predrag B.

In this study, we propose a fully-distributed non-cooperative approach to ensure self-coexistence in downlink channels of IEEE 802.22 networks. We formulate the self-coexistence problem as a mixed-integer non-linear optimization problem for maximizing the network data rate, which is an NP-hard one. This work explores a sub-optimal solution by dividing the optimization problem into downlink channel allocation and power assignment sub-problems. Considering fairness, quality of service and minimum interference for customer-premises-equipment, we also develop a greedy algorithm for channel allocation and a non-cooperative game-theoretic framework for near-optimal power allocation. The base stations of networks are treated as players in a game, where they try to increase spectrum utilization by controlling power and reaching a Nash equilibrium point. We further develop a utility function for the game to increase the data rate by minimizing the transmission power and, subsequently, the interference from neighboring networks. A theoretical proof of the uniqueness and existence of the Nash equilibrium has been presented. Performance improvements in terms of data-rate with a degree of fairness compared to a cooperative branch-and-bound-based algorithm and a non-cooperative greedy approach have been shown through simulation studies.	ac-pnk-pnl protein, autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus;appendix;apple a5;apple a7;apple a9;assignment problem;branch and bound;coexist (image);constant phase element;contraction mapping;convergence (action);data rate units;digital subchannel;dual;emoticon;entity;fairness measure;fixed point (mathematics);fixed-point number;frequency response;game theory;greedy algorithm;hymenophyllum apiculatum;ibm systems network architecture;integer (number);interference (communication);iteration;iterative method;jacobian matrix and determinant;karush–kuhn–tucker conditions;kind of quantity - equilibrium;lagrange multiplier;lagrangian system;linear programming;local convergence;mathematical optimization;np-hardness;nash equilibrium;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;norepinephrine;optimization problem;performance;programming, linear;quality of service;resource allocation;simulation;social inequality;telecommunications link;the matrix;tucker decomposition;utility;carboxypeptidase h	Sayef Azad Sakin;Md.

We consider a distributed broadband wireless system where the base stations are transparently linked by optical fiber to a central unit. We further assume that both the distributed base stations and the user terminals are equipped with an antenna array. This architecture provides a high speed backhaul channel allowing an efficient joint multiuser multicell processing. The precoder is designed in two phases: first the intercell interference is removed by applying a block diagonalization algorithm. Then the system is further optimized by using a new power allocation algorithm, based on minimization of the sum of inverse signal-to-noise ratio (SNR−1) on each user terminal over the available subcarriers. The motivation to minimize the sum of SNR−1 instead of bit error rate is the fact that the first criterion achieves a closed-form solution, which is more interesting from practical point of view. The aim is to propose a practical distributed precoding technique to remove the intercell interference and improve the user’s fairness at the cell-edges. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated and compared with an iterative precoding scheme designed to minimize the bit error rate, extended to the proposed multiuser distributed scenario, considering typical pedestrian scenarios based on LTE specifications.

Most existing works aim to maximise the overall system throughput (system-centric), which ignores the actual traffic demands of D2D users. In this study, the authors consider user-centric relay assisted D2D communications where D2D users have different evaluations for the significance of every unit of increased data rate. By considering the traffic demands of D2D users, the authors propose a Vickrey–Clarke–Groves auction based relay allocation mechanism (ARM) in which every D2D user submits a bid to the basestation (BS). The submitted bids indicate D2D users’ valuation on every unit of the increased data rate. The BS then allocates relays to D2D users by maximising the social welfare of D2D users while maintaining a predefined data rate requirement for cellular users.

In future wireless communication systems, the energy efficiency of terminals and base stations has to be improved. Therefore, we propose a new utility function which is the difference of the capacity and a weighted power cost term. Next, the utility region for single-antenna and multi-antenna multiple access channels is characterized. We show that the SISO MAC utility region is convex and provide a closed form expression for the Pareto boundary. We need the Pareto boundary to compute efficient operating points. Furthermore, an iterative algorithm is developed for weighted sum utility maximization in MISO and MIMO MAC. All results are illustrated in discussed by numerical simulations.	computer simulation;convex set;expectation–maximization algorithm;iterative method;mimo;mathematical optimization;mobile computing;multi-user;numerical analysis;pareto efficiency;power management;soft-in soft-out decoder;system analysis;telecommunications link;utility;weight function	Eduard Axel Jorswieck;Holger Boche	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2009.5198996	mathematical optimization;computer science;base station;operating system;iterative method;efficient energy use;mobile computing;computer network	Robotics	35.24525549833776	88.76868992554343	29232
4af4de129b66cdb983fed05d68d7126629a7a76f	multi-objective optimization for distributed mimo networks		In this paper, we investigate the linear transceiver optimization for multiple-inputmultiple-output (MIMO) interference networks, where multiple pairs of multi-antenna source and destination nodes communicate simultaneously. Different from most of existing works, we jointly consider three critical issues of the linear transceiver optimization for MIMO interference networks based on multi-objective optimization theory, i.e., signal transmission, energy and security. Specifically, using the modified weighted Tchebycheff method, we investigate three kinds of multi-objective optimization problems (MOOPs): 1) sum mean square error minimization and harvested energy maximization; 2) transmit power minimization and energy harvesting efficiency maximization; 3) transmit power minimization, energy harvesting efficiency maximization, and physical layer security. Based on the Charnes–Cooper transformation and penalty function method, the formulated MOOPs are transformed into convex optimization problems and thus can be effectively solved. The resulting Pareto optimal solutions set reveals the complicated but important relationships among these involved single objective optimization problems, which are usually individually investigated in the literature. Finally, numerical simulation results demonstrate the performance advantages of the proposed algorithm and corroborate the theoretical analysis.	baseline (configuration management);computer simulation;converge;convex optimization;etsi satellite digital radio;expectation–maximization algorithm;exponential hierarchy;interference (communication);iteration;iterative method;mimo;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;mean squared error;multi-objective optimization;optimization problem;pareto efficiency;penalty method;program optimization;social inequality;transceiver	Yuquan Li;Shiqi Gong;Chengwen Xing;Zesong Fei;Xinge Yan	2017	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2722478	electronic engineering;mimo;penalty method;control theory;computer simulation;computer science;convex optimization;transmission (telecommunications);multi-objective optimization;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;maximization	EDA	37.05855040610323	90.15585661663755	29321

Observing that the globally optimal point lies on the boundary of the feasible region, we transform the utility maximization problem into a more structured problem in the form of maximizing the minimum weighted utility. Then, we develop a centralized algorithm for the minimum weighted utility maximization problem as a benchmark. Next, by using extended duality theory, we introduce penalty multipliers and decompose the minimum weighted utility maximization problem into subproblems for individual users. Appealing to the simulated annealing method, we propose a distributed stochastic power control algorithm, where each user stochastically adjusts its target utility to improve the overall system utility. Although the underlying optimization problem is nonconvex, our algorithm can guarantee global optimality although the convergence rate may be slow due to the usage of simulated annealing. We improve the convergence rate further by devising an enhanced algorithm based on the geometric cooling schedule.	benchmark (computing);centralized computing;computer cooling;distributed algorithm;entropy maximization;expectation–maximization algorithm;feasible region;global optimization;hoc (programming language);lagrange multiplier;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;optimization problem;penalty method;rate of convergence;simulated annealing	Lei Yang;Yalin Evren Sagduyu;Junshan Zhang;Jason H.

In this paper, we propose a frequency collision elimination method based on negotiation and noncooperative game to avoid frequency collisions between neighboring femtocells. The frequency collisions inside a cluster are figured out by using the negotiation mechanism. The game theoretical mechanism deals with the inter-cluster frequency collisions. The femtocell network gets an equilibrium point rapidly by using the proposed methods in the context of stable femtocell network topology. Furthermore, the method is achievable in realistic communication system. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly reduces the interference and considerably increases the average capacity of femtocells.	algorithm;compaq lte;emoticon;information exchange;interference (communication);markov chain;multidimensional digital pre-distortion;network topology;prospective search;simulation;stationary process;stochastic matrix;throughput	Xiong Zhou;Suili Feng;Yuehua Ding	2014	JCM	10.12720/jcm.9.11.836-842	computer science;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	29.77679351105147	93.93089011279248	29794
c591f654a80e9e8ede8535422cb885d550639fe0	distributed interference-aware power control in ultra-dense small cell networks: a robust mean field game		In ultra-dense small cell networks, interference mitigation is very important due to severe interference. Interference dynamics caused by time-varying environment should be aware and characterized when an interference-aware power control policy is designed to mitigate interference. Meanwhile, interference perception should not be naturally assumed to have complete information with certainty. Generally, it is known that a generic player will react to all the players actions and states in a power control game, which involves huge interference-related information exchange with dynamics and uncertainties. Therefore, to reduce requirements of complete information, we formulate a robust power control mean field game taking the uncertainties of both state dynamics and cost functions into consideration. To achieve the robust power control, we regard the power control problem as a game with players whose individual states are combined by a disturbance term and a Brownian motion. We derive the robust Fokker–Planck–Kolmogorov and Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equations, and based on which we propose the robust interference-aware power control algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the improved performance and the robustness of the proposed algorithm.	algorithm;bellman equation;brownian motion;hamilton–jacobi–bellman equation;information exchange;interference (communication);jacobi method;requirement;simulation	Chungang Yang;Haoxiang Dai;Jiandong Li;Yue Zhang;Zhu Han	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2799138	complete information;power control;computer science;robustness (computer science);information exchange;small cell;distributed computing;interference (wave propagation);mean field theory	Mobile	33.04789444638113	96.16456689438407	29888

We introduce the notion of interference self-mitigating beamforming (ISM-BF), where each transmitter minimizes the interference it causes to other users while satisfying its own signal-to-inter-ferenceplus-noise ratio requirement. The computation of the optimal transmit beamformers is shown to decouple into a generalized eigenvector problem. In addition, we analyze the optimality and uniqueness of the proposed distributed beamforming solution. Numerical simulations of the sum rate performance of ISM-BF show it to be a viable alternative to interference alignment-based techniques.	beamforming;brainfuck;computation;implicit shape model;interference (communication);mimo;numerical linear algebra;simulation;transmitter	Jianqi Wang;Amitav Mukherjee;A.

In the proposed method, we select base station (BS) antennas for each user and optimize their CRBF weights under two different types of power constraints, which are the total relay power constraint and individual relay power constraints, by exploiting the notion of the maximization of the worst-case received signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR). The optimization problem of the CRBF weights can be efficiently solved using a semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique.We derive an iterative CRBF scheme to jointly select the BS antennas and optimize the CRBF weights to maximize the worst SINR among all users. Simulation results validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the tradeoffs between the number of BS antennas and the number of relays in the CRBF system.	anisotropic filtering;beamforming;best, worst and average case;etsi satellite digital radio;expectation–maximization algorithm;interference (communication);iterative method;lagrangian relaxation;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;multi-user;numerical analysis;optimization problem;relay;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;spectral efficiency;time complexity	Da Wang;Lin Bai;Chen Chen;Ye Jin;Jinho Choi	2012	2012 18th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC)	10.1109/APCC.2012.6388093	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering	Robotics	36.8011723820568	89.78916842667454	30025

The aim is to design the MIMO relay amplification matrix (i.e., the relay beamformer) to maximize the achievable communication sum rate through the relay. The design problem for the case of single-antenna users can be cast as a non-convex optimization problem, which, in general, belongs to a class of NP-hard problems. We devise a method based on the minorization-maximization technique to obtain quality solutions to the problem. Each iteration of the proposed method consists of solving a strictly convex unconstrained quadratic program. This task can be done quite efficiently, such that the suggested algorithm can handle the beamformer design for relays with up to ~70 antennas within a few minutes on an ordinary personal computer. Such a performance lays the ground for the proposed method to be employed in medium-scale (or lower regime massive) MIMO scenarios.	anisotropic filtering;beamforming;convex function;convex optimization;expectation–maximization algorithm;iteration;mimo;mathematical optimization;np-hardness;optimization problem;personal computer;quadratic programming;relay	Mohammad Mahdi Naghsh;Mojtaba Soltanalian;Petre Stoica;Maryam Masjedi;Björn E.

Since the downlink traffic is larger in magnitude than the uplink, use of femtocells provides a good solution. Femto-cells not only increase the throughput but also the overall capacity of the system while operating in the same licensed spectrum. Because of their operation in the same spectrum, interference becomes a major problem. In this paper, we study the downlink performance of a heterogeneous network by proposing a Reverse frequency allocation (RFA) scheme by dividing the cell service area into multiple regions and assign frequencies to various cell entities in such a way that the major interference is avoided. RFA scheme not only improves the spectral efficiency by utilizing the complete spectrum within one cell but also eliminates the strong interference due to macro base station on femto users.We analyze and evaluate the achievable performance of this technique for the downlink scenario. Using simulations, we show that under reasonable signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) values, multiple regions enhance the performance of users by decreasing the overall system outage probability. It is shown that a 4-region RFA scheme provides almost double performance gain over a 2-region RFA scheme for the same set of parameters.	analysis of algorithms;data recovery;downtime;entity;frequency allocation;interference (communication);loss function;multitier architecture;quality of service;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;software deployment;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;throughput	Rehan Zahid;Atta-ur-Rahman;Syed Ali Hassan	2014	2014 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2014.6906388	telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	27.4623659826187	89.77245785472282	30219

Quttoum), rihab.boukhris.1@ens.etsmtl.ca (R. In this paper, we address the autonomic resource management problem for Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) in the presence of stochastic and selfish VPN operators. Resource management is one of the most important problems that faces Internet Service Providers. In the literature, the Autonomic Service Architecture is proposed to provide a resource management model that allows systems to manage themselves and aiming to utilize optimally the unused resources. Unfortunately, this model suffers from two major limitations. First, unused resources from underloaded VPNs (lenders) are utilized over the overloaded ones (borrowers) without considering the unexpected changes of the VPNs’ state, which may often happen in the case of multimedia transmissions. This may affect negatively the Quality-of-Service (QoS) of the lenders while improving the QoS of the borrowers. Second, underloaded VPNs’ operators might behave selfishly and refuse to lend their unused (spare) resources to other overloaded VPNs. To overcome these limitations, we propose a distributed autonomic resource management, which is modeled as a repeated non-cooperative game with stochastic and selfish players. The classical Tit-for-Tat strategy is modified to cope with VPN operators who are not always able to lend some resources to others. Four different strategies are derived from Tit-for-Tat to motivate VPN operators to lend their resources to others. As far as we know, our work is among the first efforts that uses repeated non-cooperative game theory to motivate selfish participants to cooperate and to distinguish between stochastic and purely selfish VPNs’ operators. In our setting, this results in cooperative sharing of unused resources among VPNs. Simulation results show that Tit-for-Tat strategy leads to deadlocks, while our strategies assure good gains to cooperative VPN operators and punish the selfish ones. 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We consider two major candidate methods for RA preamble allocation and management, which are under consideration for possible adoption in Long Term Evolution (LTE)-Advanced. One method, Method 1, is to completely split the set of available RA preambles into two disjoint subsets: one is for human-to-human (H2H) customers and the other for M2M customers/devices. The other method, Method 2, is also to split the set into two subsets: one is for H2H customers only whereas the other is for both H2H and M2M customers. We model and analyze the throughput performance of two methods. Our results demonstrate that there is a boundary of RA load below which Method 2 performs slightly better than Method 1 but above which Method 2 degrades throughput to a large extent. Our modeling and analysis can be utilized as a guideline to design the RA preamble resource management method.	compaq lte;m2m (eclipse);machine to machine;random access;throughput;traffic collision avoidance system	Ki-Dong Lee;Sang G.

While interference mitigation to the PU spectral band from the SU’s transmission has received a lot of attention in recent literature; the novelty of our work is in considering a more realistic and effective approach of dividing the PU into sub-bands, and ensuring that the interference to each of them is below a specified threshold. With this objective, and within a power budget, we execute the tasks of power allocation, bit loading and sizing the sub-carrier bandwidth for an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based SU. After extensively analyzing the solution form of the optimization problems posed for the resource allocation, we suggest iterative algorithms to meet the aforementioned objectives. The algorithm for sub-carrier bandwidth sizing is novel, and not previously presented in literature. A multiple SU scenario is also considered, which entails assigning sub-carriers to the users, besides the resource allocation. Simulation results are provided, for both single and multi-user cases, which indicate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in a CR environment.		Vinay Thumar;Taskeen Nadkar;Gopavajhula P. S.

045a4114a7f73b9ebc44c451ea0382c17b2759de	cooperative target assignment and dwell allocation for multiple target tracking in phased array radar network		Abstract Motivated by networked anti-missile defense applications, a cooperative target assignment and dwell allocation (CTADA) algorithm is developed for multiple target tracking (MTT) in phased array radar (PAR) network. The basis of the CTADA scheme is to not only optimize the target-to-radar assignment, but also effectively allocate the limited time resource of each PAR to its responsible targets, such that the MTT performance could be efficiently improved in overload situations (the number of targets greatly exceeds the number of PARs). We formulate the resource allocation framework as a mathematical optimization problem, and use the normalized Bayesian Cramer-Rao lower bound as its objective function. The resulting optimization problem consists of two adaptable parameters, one for target-to-radar assignment and the other for dwell allocation. By exploiting the unique relationship between these two adaptable parameters, an efficient two-step solution technique, which consists of a convex relaxation step and a heuristic dividing step, is developed for the CTADA optimization problem. Simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed CTADA algorithm, in terms of the worst case tracking accuracy of the multiple targets.	phased array	Junkun Yan;Wenqiang Pu;Hongwei Liu;Shenghua Zhou;Zheng Bao	2017	Signal Processing	10.1016/j.sigpro.2017.05.014	mathematical optimization;control theory;weapon target assignment problem;mathematics;real-time computing;upper and lower bounds;heuristic;optimization problem;resource allocation;phased array	Robotics	35.60866176803726	93.78905989651327	31602

In this paper, an energy-efficient user association scheme is proposed for heterogeneous networks (HetNets) using an evolutionary game theoretic approach to maximize the energy efficiency of the whole network with the consideration of fairness among users. The dynamics of user association is formulated as the process of an evolutionary game. Each user in HetNets is modeled as a player who adjusts and chooses its base station (BS) selection strategy in order to ensure its payoff no less than the average payoff of the population. In the proposed evolutionary game based user association scheme, the learning process is formulated as replicator dynamics. The user association process ends when the system reaches an equilibrium state, where all players get the evolutionary stability strategy in the game. Simulation results show that the proposed user association scheme significantly improves both energy efficiency and user fairness compared to the conventional reference signal receiving power (RSRP) based user association scheme. Comparing with Nash Bargaining Solution (NBS) based user association scheme, the proposed scheme achieves comparable energy efficiency with reduced computation complexity and improved user fairness.	computation;fairness measure;game theory;nash equilibrium;netbeans ide;simulation;time complexity	Kaifeng Han;Dantong Liu;Yue Chen;Kok Keong Chai	2014	2014 IEEE Fourth International Conference on Big Data and Cloud Computing	10.1109/BDCloud.2014.18	simulation;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;efficient energy use	Robotics	31.06306208039406	94.12064743682684	31971
121bfd28cb80be76bbe5cb4359430324d5d2459e	a highly available spectrum allocation service model in dynamic spectrum market	dynamic spectrum allocation	Dynamic spectrum access and adaptive spectrum allocation can significantly improve the resource utilization in dynamic spectrum market. To achieve this, it is important to stimulate the primary license holders to open up their under-utilized spectrum for sharing and adaptive allocation so as to maximize the secondary user's transmission reliability with the minimum cost. In this paper, we propose a highly available spectrum allocation service model that adopts a parallel mechanism to improve the transmission reliability. A greedy algorithm is presented for minimizing the secondary user's cost with satisfied reliability requirement. Furthermore, a dynamic programming algorithm is developed for maximizing the secondary user's reliability with satisfied cost requirement. Simulation results show that, by using the proposed service model, spectrum utilization can be improved significantly and purchase price from secondary users is relatively stable.	frequency allocation	Yingwei Jin;Lulu Sun;Yanming Shen;Keqiu Li;Geyong Min	2012	Future Generation Comp.

24312df6db3958204cafafe018de07729ca5f0e2	design of a cognitive vlc network with illumination and handover requirements		In this paper, we consider a cognitive indoor visible light communications (VLC) system, comprised of multiple access points serving primary and secondary users through the orthogonal frequency division multiple access method. A cognitive lighting cell is divided into two non-overlapping regions that distinguish the primary and secondary users based on the region they are located in. Under the assumption of equal-power allocation among subcarriers, each region is defined in terms of its physical area and the number of allocated subcarriers within that region. In this paper, we provide the lighting cell design with cognitive constraints that guarantee fulfilling certain illumination, user mobility, and handover requirements in each cell. We further argue that, under some conditions, a careful assignment of the subcarriers in each region can mitigate the co-channel interference in the overlapping areas of adjacent cells. Numerical results depict the influence of different system parameters, such as user density, on defining both regions. Finally, a realistic example is implemented to assess the performance of the proposed scheme via Monte Carlo simulations.	adaptive server enterprise;cognition;frequency divider;interference (communication);monte carlo method;requirement;simulation;subcarrier;vlc media player;wireless access point	Marwan Hammouda;Jürgen Peissig;Anna Maria Vegni	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC Workshops)	10.1109/ICCW.2017.7962699	simulation;telecommunications	Robotics	27.40236848843957	89.1661923467235	32056

Dense deployment of base stations will have small cells, necessitating frequent handovers. Moreover, small cell solutions such as femtocells may lack low-delay backhaul connections to the operator core's network where handover procedures are coordinated. As a result, handover delays can be large, impacting signal quality severely. The proposed relay-based hierarchical mobility scheme forwards data over-the-air to other base stations close to mobile as the mobile moves but before the network point of attachment can be switched. Hybrid ARQ and randomized beamforming are used to opportunistically gain the benefits of relays with no explicit coordination between the relay base stations and the source or mobile. Thus, the protocol is attractive for high-speed dynamic environments and can be implemented with minimal messaging overhead. A simulation of the protocol in a 3GPP Long-Term Evolution (LTE) cellular system with dense cells and high-speed mobiles shows the ability of the protocol to mitigate short-term rate outages during handover with significant improvements for delay sensitive applications.	attachments;backhaul (telecommunications);beamforming;compaq lte;computer simulation;hybrid automatic repeat request;overhead (computing);randomized algorithm;relay;simulation;software deployment	Sundeep Rangan;Elza Erkip	2011	2011 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference - GLOBECOM 2011	10.1109/GLOCOM.2011.6134476	communications protocol;cellular network;hybrid automatic repeat request;real-time computing;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;base station;handover;lte advanced;operating system;wireless network;automatic repeat request;mobile computing;femtocell;wireless;computer network	Mobile	25.107457171807845	89.36494082130989	32088
826f6978a493bfb2bac48e5a864869d2683b6f6d	power optimization and subcarrier allocation for downlink mimo-ofdma based cognitive radio networks		This paper presents a novel resource allocation framework for downlink transmissions in MIMO-OFDMA based cognitive radio (CR) networks. In this literature, due to the coexistence of primary and secondary users (SUs) in the same geographical area, the interference induced to the primary users’ (PUs) bands from SUs’ transmissions should be less than the tolerable interference threshold predefined by PU. Hence, the optimal resource allocation strategy is performed subject to the total power constraint in the cognitive base station and the interference power constraint for PUs so that the downlink sum throughput of the CR network can be maximize without causing unacceptable interference. To this aim, two sub-problems are presented and solved theoretically based on convex optimization framework that can be used in the main body of the proposed algorithm. Regarding to the first sub-problem, the resources are distributed among all SUs in a way that just the total power constraint is satisfied. Also, the sum throughput is maximized as the interference power onto the PUs’ bands keeps in a tolerable range in the second sub-problem. So, in order to find the optimum solution, our algorithm consists of three parts. The first two parts include these sub-problems while the last section includes a combination of them. For complexity reduction, two sub-optimal resource allocation algorithms are introduced based on the simplification of main problem constraints. The performance of different approaches is investigated via simulation. Conducted simulation results show that the optimal algorithm achieves better performance in comparison with benchmark algorithms and converges to sub-problem solutions in high and low regimes of interference thresholds.	cognitive radio;mimo;mimo-ofdm;mathematical optimization;power optimization (eda);subcarrier;telecommunications link	Mahla Mohammadi;Seyed Mehdi Hosseini Andargoli	2018	Wireless Networks	10.1007/s11276-017-1463-8	throughput;subcarrier;mimo;cognitive radio;convex optimization;telecommunications link;computer science;mathematical optimization;resource allocation;power optimization	Mobile	30.787026230554883	91.35673229669025	32271

FFR is a promising resource allocation technique that can effectively mitigate inter-cell interference (ICI) in OFDMA networks. The proposed scheme enhances the conventional FFR by enabling adaptive spectral sharing per cell load conditions. Such adaptation has significant benefits in a practical environment where traffic load in different cells may be asymmetric and time-varying. The dynamic feature is accomplished via a graph approach in which the resource allocation problem is translated to a graph coloring problem. Specifically, in order to incorporate various versions of FFR in our framework, we construct a graph that matches the specific version of FFR and then color the graph using the corresponding graph algorithm. The performance improvement enabled by the proposed dynamic FFR scheme is further demonstrated by computer simulation for a 19-cell network with asymmetric cell load. For instance, the proposed dynamic FFR scheme can achieve a 12% and 33% gain in cell throughput and service rate over conventional FFR, and render a 70% and 107% gain in cell throughput and service rate with respect to the reuse-3 system.	algorithm;allan variance;compaq lte;computer simulation;graph (discrete mathematics);graph coloring;ici (programming language);interference (communication);list of algorithms;throughput	Ronald Y.

In addition to its traditional last-hop usage, it has also been widely employed for Internet access infrastructure such as wireless mesh networks (WMNs). A problem that is envisioned in the near future is the spectrum scarcity, which could be a serious threat to cope with the ever increasing demand. Regulators are aware about this problem and they have already started to look for more available spectrum. One of the possibilities that has emerged is to allow secondary assignments in licensed bands, based on the recent cognitive radio networks (CRNs) paradigm. In this context, we focus our work in the analysis of optimum spectrum allocation mechanisms for a cognitive wireless multihop mesh network. We introduce a stochastic model to formulate the problem, considering primary users’ activity and a periodically scheduled assignment scheme. To solve the problem we propose a novel robust solution, for which we develop a decentralized algorithm implementation. Furthermore, we evaluate our proposal through extensive simulations, showing for instance its superiority compared with an expectation based approach.	algorithm;cognitive radio;event-driven programming;experiment;frequency allocation;frequency band;gradient descent;internet access;mathematical optimization;mesh networking;overhead (computing);programming paradigm;real-time clock;real-time computing;requirement;simulation;software deployment;statistical model;throughput;turing completeness;white spaces (radio);wireless mesh network	Germán Capdehourat;Federico Larroca;Pablo Belzarena	2016	Ad Hoc Networks	10.1016/j.adhoc.2015.05.021	wireless mesh network;cognitive radio;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;order one network protocol;computer security;computer network	Mobile	26.171817388105154	93.74601096824685	32374

The traditional power consumption minimization problem with quality of service (QoS) constraints is reestablished from the distributed small cell eNodeB (SeNB) sleep algorithm. The proposed algorithm consists of a Rate- based Access and Scheduling (RAS) algorithm and a distributed Diluted Load based Sleep (DLS) algorithm. In RAS algorithm, a many-to-many matching model is adopted to deal with the UE access and resource allocation problem. In DLS algorithm, a metric called Diluted Load is introduced to determine the sleep SeNB and solve the sleep optimization problem in a distributed way. By alternately conducting RAS and DLS algorithms, the energy efficiency of small cells keeps improving. Simulation results show that our algorithm can achieve lower power consumption as well as lower UE blocking ratio compared with existing sleep algorithms.	access control;algorithm;blocking (computing);dls format;iterative proportional fitting;many-to-many;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;quality of service;scheduling (computing);simulation;unreal development kit	Yang Liu;Hui Tian;Gaofeng Nie	2015	2015 IEEE 82nd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2015-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2015.7391103	algorithm design;electronic engineering;real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;interference;signal-to-noise ratio	EDA	27.74076448500364	91.59167436653091	32727
f51850db33baaa13b40959f509905c0610fc149d	secrecy energy efficiency optimization for cooperative jamming in cognitive radio networks		In this paper, we address the secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) optimization problem in a cognitive radio network (CRN). The SEE is defined as the ratio of the secrecy rate and the total power consumption. In the CRN, a secondary user transmitter (SU-Tx) sends a message to a secondary user receiver (SU-Rx). At the same time, one of the trustworthy SU-Txs acts as a jammer to transmit artificial noise to protect the transmitted message from a potential eavesdropper (Eve). We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the SEE by designing the beamforming vectors of SU-Tx and the jammer. This non-convex problem is first reformulated into a convex problem via the difference of two-convex functions (D.C.) programming. Next, we develop two iterative optimization algorithms by using the Dinkelbach’s method. Finally, comprehensive simulation results are presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed SEE maximization scheme.	beamforming;brainfuck;cognitive radio;convex function;convex optimization;eve;expectation–maximization algorithm;iteration;iterative method;mathematical optimization;numerical method;optimization problem;radio jamming;scheme;simulation;superuser;transmitter	Yingkun Wen;Tao Jing;Yan Huo;Zhen Li;Qinghe Gao	2018	2018 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC)	10.1109/ICCNC.2018.8390398	transmitter;cognitive radio;convex optimization;linear programming;mobile computing;beamforming;distributed computing;computer science;maximization;optimization problem	EDA	37.363402567465606	90.23935940982588	32958

We propose an algorithm for mode selection that can be utilized by femtocells to adaptively manage themselves in different modes to optimize the performance of the overall cross-tier macro-femto network. We show simulation results that illustrate how the self-configurability is implemented for femtocells. Hence femtocells can achieve better resource allocation and enhanced coverage advantages which eventually lead to better results in terms of a signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), spectral efficiency and overall network capacity.	algorithm;interference (communication);multitier architecture;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;spectral efficiency	Furqan Hameed Khan;Young-June Choi	2012	2012 9th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks (SECON)	10.1109/SECON.2012.6275800	cognitive radio;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;sensor;radio resource management;resource management;interference;signal-to-noise ratio;computer network	Mobile	27.860419941121577	90.28359656172623	33006

In database-driven cognitive radio, PUs and SUs must provide their locations to enable dynamic channel allocation, which raises location privacy breach concern. Previous studies only focus on unilateral privacy preservation, i.e., Only PUs' or SUs' privacy is preserved. In this paper, we propose to protect bilateral location privacy of a PU and an SU. The main challenge lies in how to coordinate the PU and SU to maximize their utility provided that their location privacy is protected. We first introduce a quantitative method to calculate both PU's and SU's location privacy, and then design a novel privacy preserving Utility Maximization protocol (UMax). UMax allows for both PU and SU to adjust their privacy preserving levels and optimize transmit power iteratively to achieve the maximum utility. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that our proposed mechanism can efficiently increase the utility of both PU and SU while preserving their location privacy.	bilateral filter;case preservation;cognitive radio;differential privacy;expectation–maximization algorithm;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);iterative method;one-class classification;privacy law;simulation;superuser;utility	Zhikun Zhang;Heng Zhang;Shibo He;Peng Cheng	2015	2015 IEEE 12th International Conference on Mobile Ad Hoc and Sensor Systems	10.1109/MASS.2015.93	privacy software;cognitive radio;information privacy;computer science;interference;internet privacy;privacy;world wide web;computer security;differential privacy;computer network	Mobile	35.77698544535999	92.45137284460314	33080

However, it is still largely unexplored how content sharing could benefit from utilizing multi-hop rather than conventional single-hop D2D communications. As a step towards this end, this paper proposes a generalized two-level Stackelberg game theoretic framework to enable content sharing with multi-hop D2D communication capabilities. At the lower level, a Nash bargaining subgame is proposed to provide the routing and pricing graphs, where a novel incentive mechanism is adopted to stimulate cooperation. At the upper level, the set of participants is decided to ensure all participants contribute to the content sharing. An additional pricing plan is introduced to make sure that the final pricing is practical and feasible. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate that the proposed game theoretic framework could not only jointly deal with participants selection, routing and pricing in D2D content sharing, but also effectively restrict utilities and transmission resources to only contributive participants.	cost efficiency;game theory;nash equilibrium;numerical analysis;numerical method;peer-to-peer;routing	Yujian Fang;Yue-Zhi Zhou;Xiaohong Jiang;Di Zhang;Yaoxue Zhang	2017	2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)	10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038368	computer network;computer science;stackelberg competition;subgame;bargaining problem;incentive;restrict;distributed computing;cellular network;graph	HCI	30.894060787330254	95.37878479247992	33369

In this paper, we provide an interference coordination framework for a two-tier heterogeneous network (HetNet) that consists of a massive-MIMO enabled macro-cell base station (MBS) and a number of full-duplex small-cell base stations (SBSs). To suppress the interferences and maximize the throughput, the full-duplex mode of each SBS at the wireless backhaul link (i.e., in-band or out-of-band), which has a different impact on the interference pattern, should be carefully selected. To address this problem, we propose two centralized algorithms, a genetic algorithm (GEA) and a greedy algorithm (GRA). To sufficiently reduce the computational overhead of the MBS, a distributed graph coloring algorithm (DGCA) based on price is further proposed. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms significantly improve the system throughput.	backhaul (telecommunications);benchmark (computing);centralized computing;computation;dgca (computing);duplex (telecommunications);genetic algorithm;graph coloring;greedy algorithm;interference (communication);multi-user mimo;multitier architecture;numerical linear algebra;out-of-band agreement;overhead (computing);smart battery system;telecommunications link;throughput;time complexity	Zhaoyang Zhang;Wei Lyu	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1631/FITEE.1700047	duplex (telecommunications);communications system;mimo;throughput;distributed algorithm;computer network;heterogeneous network;interference (wave propagation);computer science;base station	Embedded	28.90994721408669	91.08467808408616	33450

IEEE 802.11n technology is developed due to the ever increasing demand for higher data rate and quality of service (QoS). However, there is an unmanaged and rapid growth of wireless devices in unlicensed frequency bands. WLANs experience significant interference from near-by environment which lead to significant performance degradation. The impetus of the present study is to describe a novel distributed algorithm that will allow interfering access points (APs) to select appropriately the channel band that will experience minimal interference. Therefore, a fair share of available spectrum is achieved. We investigate the IEEE 802.11n WLAN where a large number of clients attempt the same high bit rate from the single AP.

The proposed framework allows high flexibility on the quality of service (QoS) provision by exploiting the link quality variation. It associates a standard target tracking algorithm with a dynamic target QoS determined by a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller that induces an opportunistic behavior. Strict QoS requirements can also be fulfilled by choosing appropriately the weighting parameters of the LQR synthesis. To prevent performance degradation due to measurement uncertainties, robust solutions are developed.

76ceec9a28a43026bddbdf402b185c1abadb69b5	artificial noise aided secure precoding for mimo untrusted two-way relay systems with perfect and imperfect channel state information		Physical-layer secure is an important issue for untrusted relay systems. In this paper, we investigate secure precoding design for non-regenerative multiple-input multiple-output untrusted two-way relay systems, where artificial noise (AN) is applied at the source and the relay is untrusted. We aim to maximize the secrecy sum rate by jointly designing the source’s signal and AN precoders and the relay’s precoder, under the sources and relay transmit power constraints. We consider two scenarios that perfect and imperfect channel state information of all the channels is available. For the former, we convert the secure precoding problem to a difference of convex programming and develop a constrained concave convex procedure based iterative algorithm which can obtain a local optimal solution. We also provide asymptotic analysis on the maximum secrecy sum rate when the relay transmit power approaches infinity, and propose alternating optimization method to compute asymptotic optimal precoders. For the latter, we model the channel uncertainties by using worst-case criterion and propose the weighted minimum mean square error based method to solve the robust secure precoding problem. Numerical simulations are presented to show the effectiveness of our proposed schemes.	algorithm;best, worst and average case;channel state information;concave function;convex optimization;iterative method;mimo;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;numerical method;relay;simulation	Quanzhong Li;Liang Yang	2018	IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security	10.1109/TIFS.2018.2825944	mimo;channel state information;artificial intelligence;computer science;precoding;theoretical computer science;pattern recognition;relay;artificial noise;imperfect	Metrics	37.74745562510264	89.6201940514365	34093

Then, we formulate another problem where the secondary users are guaranteed a portion of the primary utility, on a long term basis, in return for cooperation. In both scenarios, our proposed schemes are shown to outperform non-cooperative scheduling schemes, in terms of both individual and total expected utility, for a given set of feasible constraints.

Our design is to maximize the minimum harvested energy among the multi-antenna energy receivers (ERs) while guaranteeing the secure communication requirement at the information receiver (IR) by optimizing the transmit beamforming vectors and power splitting ratio jointly. The considered max-min fair problem is non-convex and hard to tackle. Using the semi-definite relaxation (SDR) technique, we solve this problem by carrying out a one-dimensional search which refer to the solution of a series of semi-definite programs (SDPs). Also, we provide the closed-form solution based on Lagrange duality and prove that the utilized SDR is tight. Simulation results show our proposed robust scheme is more efficient than the conventional isotropic scheme in terms of energy harvesting.	beamforming;duality (optimization);etsi satellite digital radio;lagrange multiplier;linear programming relaxation;max-min fairness;maxima and minima;multi-user;secure communication;semi-supervised learning;semiconductor industry;simulation;system analysis;telecommunications link	Wei Wu;Wang Baoyun	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2015.7249074	mathematical optimization;transmitter;secure communication;erbium;telecommunications;computer science;interference;energy harvesting;robustness	EDA	37.29999378601784	90.11800412674678	34746

In standard FFR, the number of OFDMA sub-bands and the reuse factor are fixed. Whereas this works well for an idealized cell pattern, it is neither directly applicable nor adequate for real-life networks with irregular cell layouts. In this article, we consider a generalized FFR (GFFR) scheme to allow for flexibility in the total number of sub-bands as well as the number of sub-bands in each cell-edge zone, to enable network-adaptive FFR. In addition, the GFFR scheme takes power assignment in consideration. We formalize the complexity of the optimization problem, and develop an optimization algorithm based on local search to maximize the cell-edge throughput. Numerical results using networks with realistic radio propagation conditions demonstrate the applicability of the GFFR scheme in performance engineering of OFDMA networks. Introduction Orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) is a current technology for broadband radio access. In OFDMA, the radio spectrum is split into a large number of channels, referred to as sub-carriers. Data transmission is performed simultaneously over multiple sub-carriers, each carrying a low-rate bit stream. OFDMA is very flexible in exploring multi-user diversity with high spectrum efficiency and scalability. The technique is part of the downlink air interface in the fourth generation cellular systems based on 3GPP long term evolution (LTE) standards (see [1]), and IEEE 802.16 WiMAX (see [2]). Orthogonal frequency division multiple access subcarriers are orthogonal to each other. As a result, intracell interference is not present. Inter-cell interference, on the other hand, becomes a performance-limiting factor. For this reason, interference mitigation has become an important topic in performance engineering of OFDMA networks. *Correspondence: Lei.Chen@liu.se 1Department of Science and Technology, Campus Norrköping, Linköping University, SE-60174, Norrköping, Sweden Fractional frequency reuse One sub-carrier allocation scheme in multi-cell OFDMA networks is frequency reuse with factor one (reuse-1), in which the entire spectrum is made available in all cells. Here and throughout the article, a reuse factor of X means that the spectrum block in question is used in every group of X cells. Users that benefit from the reuse-1 scheme are those located close to a base station antenna, i.e., users in the cell center. Because the channel condition is good and the interference from other cells is relatively low, the throughput in cell-center zones grows by bandwidth. For users located at cell-edge areas, however, the performance typically suffers severely in the reuse-1 scheme, because of the high interference from the surrounding cells in relation to the signal of the home cell. In other words, celledge zones are much more sensitive to interference than bandwidth. Previous studies (e.g., [3]) indicate that, if the overall system throughput is the only performance target, then reuse-1 is the best choice. At the same time, the resulting performance in the cell-edge zones tends to be unacceptably low. To balance the performance of cell center against that of cell edge, interference avoidance and mitigation techniques have been investigated in recent years.

In FFR, the service area of every cell is split into a center zone and an edge zone. The spectrum is correspondingly partitioned into two parts. One part is allocated with reuse-1 in all cell-center zones. The second part is further split into sub-bands. These sub-bands, to be used in the cell-edges zones, have a higher reuse factor. As a result, significant interference reduction is achieved in cell-edge zones. In standard FFR, derived for an ideal network layout with hexagonally shaped cells, the edge band is split into three sub-bands, each with a reuse factor of three (reuse-3); every edge zone is allocated one of the three sub-bands, see Figure 1 for an illustration. For the cell layout in Figure 1, the standard sub-band allocation pattern with reuse-3 is very intuitive. The allocation pattern ensures that the sub-band of a cell-edge zone is not reused in any of the neighboring cells. In reallife cellular networks, however, the amount of interference is very irregular over the service area. The cells differ greatly in the number of significant interferers as well as the respective amounts of interference, causing difficulties in applying standard FFR. As the number of surrounding cells varies from one cell to another, allocating the sub-bands optimally is not straightforward. For the same reason, a single reuse factor, if applicable at all, is no longer optimal. In addition, because the sensitivity to interference varies by cell, the allocation of one sub-band per edge zone may not be adequate. Finally, scalability becomes an issue, because it is not optimal to replicate the allocation pattern of one part of the network to another. A generalized FFR scheme In this article we present and evaluate a generalized FFR (GFFR) scheme, in order to overcome the limitations of standard FFR in dealing with real-life networks with irregular cell layout. As a result, the allocation pattern is adapted to the characteristics of each individual network. The GFFR scheme that we consider extends the standard one in three aspects. First, the frequency band used for cell-edge zones can be partitioned into any number of sub-bands. Doing so is potentially useful for interference avoidance in cells with many surrounding interfering	access network;algorithm;allan variance;bandwidth (signal processing);bitstream;campus party;compaq lte;data recovery;entity–relationship model;frequency band;frequency divider;interference (communication);local search (optimization);mathematical optimization;mobile phone;multi-user;optimization problem;performance engineering;real life;scalability;self-replicating machine;software propagation;spectral efficiency;springer (tank);subcarrier;telecommunications link;throughput	Lei Chen;Di Yuan	2012	EURASIP J.

We consider a group of SU's with limited spectrum sensing capabilities working cooperatively to find primary channel spectrum holes. The objective is to design the optimal sensing and access policies that maximize the total secondary throughput on primary channels accrued over time. Although the problem can be formulated as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), the optimal solutions are intractable. Instead, we find the optimal sensing policy within the class of myopic policies. Compared to other existing approaches, our policy is more realistic because it explicitly assigns SU's to sense specific primary channels by taking into account spatial and temporal variations of primary channels. Contributions: (1) formulation of a centralized spectrum sensing/access architecture that allows exploitation of all available primary spectrum holes; and (2) proposing sub-optimal myopic sensing policies with low-complexity implementations and performance close to the myopic policy. We show that our proposed sensing/access policy is close to the optimal POMDP solution and outperforms other proposed strategies. We also propose a Hidden Markov Model based algorithm to estimate the parameters of primary channel Markov models with a linear complexity.	access control;algorithm;centralized computing;coefficient;cognitive radio;computation;heuristic;hidden markov model;hungarian algorithm;iterative method;markov chain;partially observable markov decision process;primary channel;simulation;stationary process;superuser;throughput	Yang Li;Sudharman K.

6f2cd18790e99e75e76845dc8c354ffcf4f71567	a realistic error model of imperfect csi in cognitive radio channels		Regarding the channel state information (CSI) in a cognitive radio (CR) channel, it is often realistic to assume that the secondary user (SU) knows perfectly its direct link, but it is not realistic to assume that it also knows its interfering links to the primary receivers (PRs). Traditional power allocation and scheduling algorithms in CR channels have been based on the assumption of global perfect channel knowledge at the secondary transmitter (ST). In this paper, we analyze the impact of channel estimation errors on the secondary user and on the primary users as well. We propose a novel error model which is a more realistic error model comparing to the classic one that describe the estimation error of the interfering links to the PRs. On the one hand, the robustness of water-filling algorithms which allow the SU to minimize its power consumption under QoS and CR interference power constraints to channel estimation errors in the SU interfering links. On the other hand, we analyze the possible impact of these estimation errors on the PU interference constraints. We consider the worst case with respect to the estimation errors at the SU as well as the worst estimation error that effect the interference created to the PU. Our analysis shows that the water-filling algorithm not only provides robustness in terms of power consumption but also in terms of scheduling of the SU given the realistic estimation error model.	best, worst and average case;channel state information;cognitive radio;inline linking;interference (communication);iterative method;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;one-class classification;optimization problem;power gain;scheduling (computing);superuser;transmitter;water filling algorithm;worst-case scenario	Raouia Masmoudi	2017	2017 9th International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)	10.1109/ICUMT.2017.8255179	cognitive radio;quality of service;robustness (computer science);channel state information;algorithm design;scheduling (computing);computer science;distributed computing;transmitter;communication channel	EDA	35.762788163393765	89.68740453920189	35295

Different from previous works in this area that mainly focus on secrecy rate maximization or power minimization problems, here, we aim to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the system subject to the secret rate and transmit power constraints, which is a nonconvex optimization and hard to tackle. To solve it, we first transform it into an equivalent parameterized polynomial subtractive form and then approximate the nonconvex equivalent problem into a convex optimization problem by means of Taylor series expansion. Based on that, an iterative algorithm with proved convergence is proposed, and this algorithm is also extended to an imperfect-channel-state-information case. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms traditional design methods in terms of EE.	approximation algorithm;channel state information;convex optimization;expectation–maximization algorithm;iterative method;mimo;mathematical optimization;numerical method;optimization problem;polynomial;series expansion	Haiyang Zhang;Yongming Huang;Shidang Li;Luxi Yang	2014	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2014.2331273	mathematical optimization;taylor series;control theory;mathematics	EDA	37.43622220043753	90.33491103352412	35346

Traditionally, users watching different channels are organized into separate overlays, where there is no cooperation among different channels. However, based on measurement studies, cross-channel cooperation is found to be desirable due to the bandwidth imbalance among different channels. In this paper, we focus on studying the characteristics of existing and potential designs to help system designers choose proper cross-channel cooperation strategies considering efficiency and implementation complexity. Specifically, we propose simple models based on network flow graphs for three general designs, namely Naive Bandwidth allocation Approach (NBA), Passive Channel-aware bandwidth allocation Approach (PCA) and Active Channel-aware bandwidth allocation Approach (ACA) respectively, which capture the key characteristics of different designs. We develop closed-form results for two-channel systems. Then, we use extensive numerical simulations to compare the three designs for various peer population distributions, upload bandwidth distributions and channel structures. Our analytical and simulation results show that: 1) Though the NBA design can be implemented with low complexity, it cannot efficiently use user's bandwidth in general cases; 2) the PCA design can achieve the same bandwidth utilization efficiency as the ACA design in general cases; and 3) the ACA design should be used for special applications and systems in which a user is restricted to watch only one channel at a time.	american cryptogram association;content delivery network;flow network;iptv;numerical analysis;peer-to-peer;principal component analysis;simulation;streaming media;throughput;upload	Miao Wang;Lisong Xu;Byrav Ramamurthy	2010	2010 17th IEEE Workshop on Local & Metropolitan Area Networks (LANMAN)	10.1109/LANMAN.2010.5507144	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network	Metrics	30.751782311696523	98.03547199234036	35482

In order to address this issue, mobile operators have adopted static Intercell Interference Coordination (ICIC) strategies, including Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR), given their low complexity and easy implementation. However, recent results made evident the need for additional research efforts as the performance of FFR is poor in realistic cellular deployments. Thus, this paper presents a solution to this problem by means of a novel multiobjective optimization framework able to adapt FFR to any realistic cellular layout. By tuning the operational parameters of FFR at cell level, the proposed scheme succeeds in finding solutions outperforming reference schemes and baseline designs in terms of network capacity and cell edge performance while keeping energy consumption as low as possible.	allan variance;baseline (configuration management);catastrophic interference;compaq lte;genetic algorithm;ici (programming language);interference (communication);mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;relevance;software propagation;statistical interference	David G.

In addition, next generation wireless systems needs to provide flexible transmission rate to each terminal. In this paper, a utility-based game-theoretic model is proposed to study the joint power and rate control problem in spectrum underlay fashion in cognitive networks. We adopt a novel utility function based on cognitive network which focuses on social optimal resource allocation through pricing. Further, we show an interference threshold elasticity perspective, which is the key for primary network to maximize its utility by increasing its transmitted power to adjust the tolerable interference constraint. And also, the cognitive network can increase its total throughput capacity. In Stackelberg game, the primary user and the cognitive radio users interact with each other by adjusting their own actions. The cooperative cognitive networks model follows the “best-effort” principle as well as the win-win perspective of primary-cognitive user. Numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the model.

In this paper, with the joint impact of user preference and selfishness, the D2D assisted content dissemination process is investigated in order to maximize the offloading gain via D2D communications. An alternative group pushing optimization (AGPO) algorithm is proposed to solve the formulated nonconvex problem. In addition, for the special case of two groups, the optimal solution is derived in closed-form to help validate the algorithm. Finally, the simulation results show that the AGPO algorithm converges to the global optimum and has a much lower complexity compared to exhaustive search.	algorithm;brute-force search;global optimization;mathematical optimization;simulation	Yi-Jin Pan;Cunhua Pan;Huiling Zhu;Qasim Zeeshan Ahmed;Ming Chen;Jiangzhou Wang	2017	2017 IEEE 85th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2017.8108251	computer network;global optimum;computer science;brute-force search;special case;selfishness;cellular network	EDA	30.987066264490892	92.83693033078418	35864

The assignment between users and subcarriers is allocated together with the users' transmit powers for energy efficiency maximization, by means of a novel approach which merges the popular Dinkelbach's algorithm with the frameworks of distributed auction theory and stable matching. Two distributed algorithms are presented, which can be implemented in a fully decentralized way. The former is guaranteed to converge to the global optimum of the system energy efficiency, up to a threshold which can be set in advance, while the latter enjoys weaker optimality properties, but has an even lower computational complexity. Additionally, we develop a novel energy consumption model which explicitly accounts for the energy consumption due to feedback transmissions. Employing this new model, it is shown that the proposed distributed algorithms can even outperform centralized resource allocations which require a larger feedback energy consumption.	centralized computing;computational complexity theory;converge;distributed algorithm;expectation–maximization algorithm;fractional programming;global optimization;interference (communication);mimo;maxima and minima;stable marriage problem;subcarrier	Alessio Zappone;Eduard Axel Jorswieck;Amir Leshem	2016	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2016.2621379	game theory;mathematical optimization;real-time computing;computer science;resource management;distributed computing;efficient energy use;statistics;mimo	Mobile	32.32569663205848	92.92386304999255	36023
243bcd7b9396dbb0d8c21ec32aa353658fa15a05	two-dimensional distributed spectrum reusing in cognitive radio network: based on game theory		We investigate the global throughput maximization of distributed spectrum reusing (DSR) in cognitive radio (CR) network, which reaches the two-dimensional spectrum multiplexing. Most previous works only consider the temporal-domain accessing, which greatly underutilize the spectrum resources. In this paper, we propose a new temporal-spatial spectrum reusing scheme by fully exploiting the location information of devices, where multiple users can access one channel simultaneously. In distributed applications, the global information will be unavailable, and therefore a non-cooperative game is formulated. It is proved as an exact potential game (EPG), which has at least one pure strategy Nash equilibrium (NE). Then, an improved decentralized reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is developed to achieve the NE points. The network performance is evaluated by computer simulations.	ansi escape code;cognitive radio;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;distributed computing;expectation–maximization algorithm;game theory;local optimum;multi-user;multiplexing;nash equilibrium;network performance;q-learning;reinforcement learning;throughput;utility	Chaoqiong Fan;Bin Li;Chenglin Zhao;Arumugam Nallanathan	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2017.7996999	cognitive radio;computer network;real-time computing;game theory;potential game;reinforcement learning;strategy;computer science;network performance;multiplexing;communication channel	Robotics	32.949742806891464	94.57281857144058	36217

We propose polynomial-time message-passing based algorithms, one of which is guaranteed to yield a solution that is within a constant fraction of the optimal solution and is also asymptotically optimal in the limit as the number of subcarriers in the system goes to infinity. The message-passing based algorithm is also extended to solve the resource allocation problem over a multi-cell uplink in a distributed fashion. Our algorithms account for finite input alphabets and non-ideal practical outer codes. Extensive simulations are performed to assess the performance of the proposed algorithms and it is shown that they yield near-optimal solutions at a low complexity and with a low memory requirement.	asymptotically optimal algorithm;code;message passing;np-hardness;polynomial;set packing;simulation;subcarrier;telecommunications link;time complexity	Kai Yang;Narayan Prasad;Xiaodong Wang	2009	2009 Conference Record of the Forty-Third Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers	10.1109/TCOMM.2011.020811.090778	distributed algorithm;real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;theoretical computer science;np-hard;distributed computing	Theory	33.47606424284263	90.91485145389204	36273

Improving the efficiency of mobile networks, both in terms of services and energy consumption, is thus critical for sustaining this growing demand. While the adoption of new technologies such as small cell networks and cognitive radio reduces deployment and operational costs, challenges remain on how the data traffic can be efficiently processed and transported over the mobile backhaul network. In this paper, we aim to improve the energy efficiency of mobile backhaul networks, while simultaneously balancing the traffic load on its various backhaul nodes, in order to maintain the required service quality. We first formulate a multi-objective optimisation problem, then propose a distributed traffic control algorithm to solve it. We show the convergence of the algorithm through Lyapunov analysis; and numerical simulations illustrate the results. We find that the traffic dynamics pose notable challenges for operators to plan, design and operate mobile backhaul networks when aiming to achieve the desired energy-performance tradeoffs.	algorithm;augmented lagrangian method;backhaul (telecommunications);cognitive radio;computer simulation;distributed algorithm;global optimization;iterative method;lagrange multiplier;load (computing);load balancing (computing);lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;scheduling (computing);smartphone;software deployment;tablet computer;total system power	Tao Lin;Tansu Alpcan;Kerry Hinton;Arun Vishwanath	2015	2015 IEEE Conference on Control Applications (CCA)	10.1109/CCA.2015.7320843	real-time computing;simulation;engineering;small cell;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	25.24165740998467	92.78921459504092	36544

In the derivation process, we reveal the new property that the optimization problem of downlink spatial scheduling is equivalent to that of uplink scheduling under the BS's zero-forcing beamforming. Using this property, an efficient downlink scheduling algorithm is presented, applying the principle of an uplink scheduling algorithm. Numerical results show that the presented spatial scheduling achieves a much higher system throughput than a multiuser MIMO system without spatial scheduling or with conventional spatial scheduling by linear processing.

In order to solve this non-convex problem, we first decompose the original problem into a sequence of parallel subproblems which can optimized separately. For each subproblem, a base station employs dirty paper coding to maximize the EE for users within a cell while regulating interference induced to other cells. Since each sub-problem can be transformed to a convex multiple-access channel problem, the proposed method provides a closed-form solution for power allocation. Then, based on the derived optimal covariance matrix for each subproblem, a local optimal solution is obtained to maximize the sum EE. Finally, simulation results show that our algorithm based on non-linear precoding achieves about 20 percent performance gains over the conventional linear precoding method.	algorithm;convex optimization;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;multi-user;nonlinear system;simulation;weight function	Xin Gui;Kyoung-Jae Lee;Jaehoon Jung;Inkyu Lee	2016	Journal of Communications and Networks	10.1109/JCN.2016.000122	mathematical optimization;telecommunications;zero-forcing precoding;interference;efficient energy use;precoding;statistics;mimo	AI	36.508610885604	89.75758235114732	36623
3f30533eb59a1799a0de439fcfb49bb89da2464c	an improved centralized cognitive radio network spectrum allocation algorithm based on the allocation sequence		The demand of the wireless communications service is increasing in recent years, and the demand of the wireless communication rate is increasing too. However, the static spectrum allocation mechanism results in lots of free spectrum resources in space, and the spectrum is wasted. The cognitive radio technology with intelligent searching and efficient utilization of the idle spectrum resources just provides the opportunity to use the free spectrum resources. Thus, the spectrum allocation technology of the cognitive radio has also been more and more broadly concerned. In order to avoid the interference, a mathematical model of spectrum allocation for cognitive radio spectrum allocation algorithm is established through a graph theory. The spectrum allocation algorithms with different allocation objectives based on graph theory are studied according to the different network structures. After the basic ideas and allocation processes of these algorithms are described, a centralized network spectrum allocation algorithm based on the allocation sequence is proposed. Simulation results show that the improved algorithm can significantly reduce the time overhead and can have better fairness compared with other existing Collaborative-Max-Sum-Reward (CSUM), Collaborative-Max-Min-Reward (CMIN), and Collaborative-Max-Proportional-Fair (CFAIR) algorithms under the same design criterion.	algorithm;centralized computing;cognitive radio	Jianli Zhao;Jinsha Yuan	2013	IJDSN	10.1155/2013/875342	mathematical optimization;cognitive radio;simulation;max-min fairness;computer science;static memory allocation;distributed computing;bandwidth allocation	Robotics	29.348692971187745	93.45723005836494	36672

Email: ayaz.uet@gmail.com Abstract Energy efficiency (EE) is currently the key performance evaluation metric for wireless networks. This paper considers the maximization of EE of an uplink wireless network that uses single-carrier frequency division multiple access. The EE metric considered is bits/Joule, and a joint power and subchannel allocation problem is formulated to maximize this EE metric under constraints on the minimum achieved data rate of each user, the maximum transmit power budget of each user, and the exclusive as well as the consecutive allocation of single-carrier frequency division multiple access subchannels among the users. This problem is a nonlinear and combinatorial optimization problem, and its optimal solution is prohibitively difficult. To make the problem tractable and find its optimal solution, it is transformed into an equivalent binary integer programming problem, which is a standard set partitioning problem. This approach named as the optimal energy-efficient (OPT-EE) algorithm finds optimal solution with significantly reduced computational complexity compared to the solution of the original problem. In addition, a heuristic suboptimal energy-efficient approach is also investigated, which has acceptable performance with much less computational complexity compared to the OPT-EE algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of OPT-EE and heuristic suboptimal energy-efficient algorithms and their comparison with the available work in the literature.	carrier frequency;cobham's thesis;combinatorial optimization;computation;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;data rate units;digital subchannel;electrical engineering;email;expectation–maximization algorithm;frequency divider;heuristic;integer programming;java platform, enterprise edition;joule;linear programming;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;optimization problem;partition problem;performance evaluation;telecommunications link;uncompressed video	Farooq Alam Orakzai;Ayaz Ahmad;Mohammad Toaha Raza Khan;Muhammad Ather Iqbal	2017	Trans.

However, the power strategy space of the existing Nash non-cooperative power games are generally statically pre-determined without adapting to the changing wireless environment. To address this problem, we explore a novel framework of Nash non-cooperative power game with dynamic and environment-adaptive power strategy space. Then, we propose a non-cooperative water-filling power game with pricing (WFPGP), wherein the power strategy space is dynamically determined by iterative water- filling algorithm. We derive the sufficient condition for the existence and uniqueness of the WFPGP game which can be implemented in a distributed manner. Simulation results are used to compare the performance of WFPGP with the other Nash non- cooperative power games and confirm the stable and superior performance advantages of WFPGP.	iterative method;multi-user mimo;nash equilibrium;power player super joy iii;simulation;telecommunications link;throughput;water filling algorithm	Shu Fu;Zhou Su	2017	2017 IEEE 86th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2017.8288173	throughput;computer network;wireless network;uniqueness;dynamic demand;equilibrium point;telecommunications link;wireless;computer science;distributed computing;precoding	Mobile	32.41458512075439	94.03787691102794	37402

It is known that NOMA is beneficial when the difference between two channel gains is very large and therefore the two channels are separable. We study general wireless MIMO-NOMA networks in which the two channels might be non-separable. Based on channel state information, we formulate and solve a non-convex optimization problem in order to maximize the sum rate and provide guaranteed rate to the weaker user. We divide the non-convex optimization problem into two parts and propose algorithms for solving them.

07df8494067240547ff8dbef5d5936ed074ceb33	efficient resource allocation in wireless network virtualization: a joint design of adverse selection and moral hazard		Wireless network virtualization has been envisioned as a promising technology to enhance resource utilization and reduce expenditure. In this paper, we propose a virtual resource allocation strategy in a mobile virtual network, which reuses spectrum resource to reduce the physical resource that service providers (SPs) need to purchase and also enhance spectrum efficiency. Mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) benefit not only from sales of the spectrum resource, but also from its reuse levels by SPs. However, the SPu0027s service quality requirement and user channel state information are hidden information to the MVNO, and are the basis needed for the MVNOu0027s resource allocation design. Besides, how many users will be arranged to reuse is a hidden action, independently decided by the SPs themselves, which the MVNO is unable to know. To deal with the two kinds of asymmetric information problems, we design contracts which include two parts of fees charged for each SP. First of all, SPs are classified into different types based on their distinct characteristics and assigned with corresponding resource prices to deal with the hidden information problem. Then to incentivize higher resource reuse level, rank-order tournament (ROT) design is adopted to obtain the MVNOu0027s commission rates for SPs. Numerical results show that our scheme can improve the utility of both SPs and MVNOs as well as the spectrum efficiency.	channel state information;design by contract;moral hazard;spectral efficiency	Chuyi Guo;Yanru Zhang;Li Wang;Zhu Han;Ping Zhang	2017	2017 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)	10.1109/ICCChina.2017.8330394	resource management;virtualization;wireless network;computer network;service provider;reuse;virtual network;computer science;resource allocation;spectral efficiency	Mobile	29.958521680765664	94.84108046878859	38588

When each spatially distributed user in the wireless system is assumed to have i.i.d. scalar CSI values, the optimal fixed-rate and entropy-constrained point density functions are established in the high-resolution regime for the quantization of the CSI feedback to a centralized scheduler under the mean square error (MSE) criterion. The spatially distributed nature of the users leads to a distributed functional scalar quantization approach for the optimal high resolution point densities of the CSI feedback. Under a mild absolute moment criterion, it is shown that with a greedy scheduling algorithm at the centralized scheduler, the optimal fixed-rate point density for each user corresponds to a point density associated with the maximal order statistic distribution. This result is generalized to monotonic functions of arbitrary order statistics. Optimal point densities under entropy-constrained quantization for the CSI are established under mild conditions on the distribution function of the CSI metric.	centralized computing;channel state information;codebook;feedback;greedy algorithm;image resolution;lloyd's algorithm;maximal set;mean squared error;multi-user;quantization (signal processing);scheduling (computing)	Matthew Pugh;Bhaskar D.

Various existing facilities including mobile devices with idle resources, vehicles, and MEC servers deployed at base stations or road side units, could act as edges in the network. Since task offloading incurs extra transmission energy consumption and transmission latency, two key questions to be addressed in such an environment are (i) should the workload be offloaded to the edge or computed in terminals? (ii) Which edge, among the available ones, should the task be offloaded to? In this paper, we formulate the task assignment problem as a one-to-many matching game which is a powerful tool for studying the formation of a mutual beneficial relationship between two sets of agents. The main goal of our task assignment mechanism design is to reduce overall energy consumption, while satisfying task owners' heterogeneous delay requirements and supporting good scalability. An intensive simulation is conducted to evaluate the efficiency of our proposed mechanism.	abbreviations;access network;activity selection problem;algorithm;assignment problem;assumed;augmented reality;computation (action);computational complexity theory;computer simulation;conceptualization (information science);conflict (psychology);drug vehicle;edge computing;futures studies;genetic heterogeneity;heuristic (computer science);heuristics;interference (communication);linear programming;map7 gene;matching;manuscripts;mathematical optimization;mental association;mobile applications;mobile device;natural science disciplines;one-to-many (data model);programming, linear;quality of service;requirement;scalability;serial digital video out;server (computer);software-defined networking;uncompressed video;virtual private server	Bo Gu;Yapeng Chen;Haijun Liao;Zhenyu Zhou;Di Zhang	2018		10.3390/s18082423	electronic engineering;quality of service;cloud computing;mobile edge computing;engineering;distributed computing;edge computing	Robotics	29.88622024158003	96.81054934338766	39035

Through modeling the access of PUs and multiple classes of SUs as continuous-time Markov chains, we analyze the overall system performance with consideration of a grade-of-service guarantee for both the PUs and the SUs. In addition, two new call admission control (CAC) strategies are devised in our models to enhance the maximum admitted traffic of SUs for the system. Numerical results show that the proposed heterogeneous-prioritized policy achieves higher maximum admitted traffic for SUs. The trade-off between the system’s serving capability and the fairness among multiple classes of SUs is also studied. Moreover, the proposed CAC strategies can achieve better performance under max-sum, proportional, and max-min fairness criteria than the conventional CAC strategies.

To improve system throughput and increase resource utilization, a novel interference coordination scheme is proposed. The proposed scheme includes two steps. First, in order to mitigate the interference from D2D transmission to cellular communication, we propose an efficient power control scheme to obtain an upper bound of D2D transmitter power. Next, based on the upper bound, two resource block (RB) allocation rules aiming to control the interference from cellular networks (CNs) to receivers in D2D multicast group are proposed. Simulation results show that by applying the proposed scheme, the performance of the hybrid system can be significantly improved compared to the conventional ways.	hybrid system;interference (communication);mobile phone;multicast;simulation;throughput;transmitter	Dongyu Wang;Xiaoxiang Wang;Yuan Zhao	2012	2012 IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2012.6398945	transmitter;electronic engineering;telecommunications;power control;computer science;radio resource management;co-channel interference;radio receiver;computer network	Mobile	31.560482486761604	89.4956257806913	39155

Due to the increasing number of vehicles and the users' various requirements, resource allocation problem in vehicular networks becomes more serious and has attracted researchers' attention. In this paper, we investigate the resource allocation in software defined fog vehicular networks where we formulate the problem as a mean-field game (MFG). We present a state space function by considering both interference factors and energy availability. Then the problem can be modeled as a cost minimization with the constraint of state space. Through the mean-field approximation method, we derive the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) and Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equations. A joint finite difference algorithm is proposed to solve the coupled HJB and FPK equations. The numerical results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.	algorithm;approximation;fifth generation computer;finite difference;finite difference method;hamilton–jacobi–bellman equation;interference (communication);jacobi method;kalman filter;kolmogorov complexity;lagrange polynomial;linear programming relaxation;longest common subsequence problem;loss function;numerical analysis;numerical method;requirement;smart battery system;state space	Yaomin Zhang;Haijun Zhang;Keping Long;Xiaoming Xie;Victor C.

3fe2224fcc1b743e5db60f294b050464da266123	joint subcarrier and power allocation for ofdma based mobile edge computing system		By offloading computationally intensive tasks to the edge cloud provided by the cellular base stations, the mobile edge computing (MEC) technique has the potential to realize the critical millisecond-scale latency requirement of next generation mobile services. In this paper, we investigate the joint subcarrier and power allocation problem in an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) based MEC system to minimize the maximal delay of each mobile device. The partial data offloading scenario is considered where mobile data can be computed at both local devices and the edge cloud. Since the problem is a combinatorial optimization one, we first propose a lower-bound algorithm by relaxing the channel allocation indicators into continuous variables. Then, to find a low-complexity feasible solution, we further develop a heuristic algorithm which separates subcarrier assignment and power allocation. The performances of our proposed algorithms are finally tested by extensive numerical simulations.	algorithm;combinatorial optimization;concave function;convex optimization;edge computing;fairness measure;frequency divider;heuristic (computer science);mathematical optimization;maximal set;mobile app;mobile device;numerical analysis;optimization problem;performance;serial digital video out;simulation;subcarrier	Mengyuan Li;Shuo Yang;Zhenduo Zhang;Jinke Ren;Guanding Yu	2017	2017 IEEE 28th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2017.8292207	subcarrier;computer network;mobile broadband;orthogonal frequency-division multiple access;cloud computing;mobile edge computing;combinatorial optimization;computer science;channel allocation schemes;base station	Mobile	31.164089241338907	92.04521151455104	39535
c8227f02e976dc016242a7a9ffe5e46240bb1a37	dynamic spectrum pricing with secondary user's normal demand preference		During secondary user’s dynamic access to authorized spectrum, a key issue is how to ascertain an appropriate spectrum price so as to maximize primary system’s benefit and satisfy secondary user’s diverse spectrum demands. In this paper, a scheme of pricing-based dynamic spectrum access is proposed. According to the diverse qualities of idle spectrum, the proposed scheme applies a Hotelling game model to form the spectrum pricing problem. Firstly, establish a model of spectrum leasing, among which the idle spectrum with different qualities constitutes a spectrum pool. 1en, divide the idle spectrum into equivalent width of leased channels, which will be uniformly sold in order. Secondary users can choose proper channels to purchase in the spectrum pool according to their spectrum usage preferences which are subject to normal distribution and affected by the spectrum quality along with market estimation. 1is paper analyzes the effect of spectrum pricing according to the primary system’s various tendencies to spectrum usage and economic income. Numerical results evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed pricing method in improving the primary system’s profits.	algorithm;authorization;centralized computing;iterative method;nash equilibrium;performance;utility	Li Wang	2018	Mobile Information Systems	10.1155/2018/3572508	computer network;mathematical optimization;normal distribution;profit (economics);computer science;economic income;idle;communication channel	Metrics	30.33824417846162	95.59636276936698	39581

However, all existing studies on such cooperative cognitive radio networks (CCRNs) operate in the temporal domain only, which limits the performance of both PUs and SUs. On the other hand, multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) enables transmission of multiple independent data streams in the spatial domain to improve capacity. Taking advantage of the MIMO technique in CCRNs is an unexplored area that we investigate in this paper. We propose a novel MIMO-CCRN framework, which enables the SUs to utilize MIMO techniques to cooperatively relay the traffic for the PUs, while concurrently accessing the same channel to transmit their own traffic. Specifically, we consider two typical network scenarios. For the case of a general PU link and multiple SUs, we provide theoretical analysis for the link rates and then formulate an optimization model based on a Stackelberg game to maximize the utilities of PUs and SUs. In addition, we extend our analysis to a practical cellular network with multiple MIMO-empowered femtocells, and provide an algorithm to find a stable matching of the PUs and SUs. Evaluation results show that high utility gains are achieved by both PUs and SUs by leveraging MIMO spatial cooperation in our proposed framework.	algorithm;cognitive radio;cooperative mimo;ibm systems network architecture;iterative method;mimo;mathematical optimization;programming paradigm;relay;simulation;stable marriage problem;systems architecture;transmitter	Sha Hua;Hang Liu;Xuejun Zhuo;Mingquan Wu;Shivendra S.

It is well known that energy harvesting is one of the most important technologies of the green communication. Due to the intermittency of the renewable energy and the different space of the Base stations (BSs), the renewable energy cooperation is necessary to improve the renewable energy efficiency. In this paper, we propose a renewable energy cooperation scheme among different BSs, in which one BS can collect (share) energy from (to) another BSs. It is obvious that the energy cooperation efficiency will be improved when the number of the BSs that join the cooperation scheme is large. In this paper, our objective is to minimize the networks delay of each BS. To minimize the networks delay, it is reasonable that each BS hopes to transfer its energy to another BSs as little as possible, and collects energy from another BSs as much as possible. Thus, the objective of each BS are conflicting. We formulate the joint optimization problem into a many-objective mixed integer optimization problem which is difficult to optimize. We adopt the evolutionary many-objective algorithm based on decomposition and reference distance to optimize the problem. Simulation results show that the effectiveness of the algorithm.	combinatorial optimization;evolutionary algorithm;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;reference distance;simulation;spectral efficiency;subcarrier;video projector	Qiang Wang;Hailin Liu;Yiu-ming Cheung	2016	2016 12th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security (CIS)	10.1109/CIS.2016.0053	renewable energy;mathematical optimization;simulation;resource management;statistics	EDA	30.096663229285916	93.13628477285124	39764

Cellular users and D2D pairs help each other to improve their respective performance. Specifically, via coalition formation, cellular users release some of their spectrum to D2D pairs so as to start the communications of the D2D pairs; at the same time, D2D pairs help to relay the messages of the cellular users. The D2D pairs are thought to be socially untrusted to the cellular users, as thus, a secrecy problem for cellular users comes into being due to the relaying. Then we address this problem from a physical layer security perspective. A coalition formation algorithm is designed to solve the spectrum management problem in this cooperative system.

The algorithm attempts to maximize the sum over user utilities, where each user's utility is a function of his total transmission rate. Users exchange interference prices reflecting the marginal cost of interference on each sub-channel, and then update their power allocations given the interference prices and their own channel conditions. A similar algorithm was studied earlier assuming that each user's utility function is a separable function of the user's rate per sub-channel. Here, we do not assume this separability. We give a different algorithm for updating each user's power allocation and show that this algorithm converges monotonically. Numerical results comparing this algorithm to several others are also presented.	distributed algorithm;frequency divider;interference (communication);linear separability;marginal model;multiplexing;numerical method;transmitter;utility	Changxin Shi;Randall Berry;Michael L.

d5cadba77f43a867b78650b70ae7b53f3d94f319	on the design of computation offloading in cache-aided d2d multicast networks		As the demand of data-hungry and computing intensive tasks grows dramatically, cache-aided device-to-device multicast (D2MD) networks are introduced, which can offload traffic from the base stations to D2D users (DUEs) directly to alleviate the heavy burden on backhaul links and improve the energy and spectrum efficiency. However, most previous works ignored the limitation of battery power and scarce computing capabilities of DUEs. In this paper, we study the computation and traffic offloading in cache-aided D2MD networks for the content delivery and delay sensitive task offloading services. Firstly, in order to provide stable multicast links and enhanced computing resources, a D2D cluster head (DCH) selection strategy is proposed that jointly considers the social attributes, available energy, and transfer rate of DUEs. Secondly, to improve the efficiency of content distribution and optimize the energy consumption of content delivery, we propose a novel multicast-aware coded and cooperative caching scheme, which may increase the opportunity for D2D multicasting to obtain the desired contents. Thirdly, considering the DUEs association, uplink full duplex DCH transmission power allocation, and mobile edge computing computation resource scheduling, an optimization computation offloading model is formulated. On this basis, we model the computation offloading and resource allocation optimization problem. Furthermore, we transform this problem into user allocation optimization problem and resource allocation optimization problem (RAOP), and RAOP is proved as a convex problem, and the optimal resource allocation solution is found. Finally, the simulation results show that our proposed schemes can effectively decrease the energy consumption and computing costs.	backhaul (telecommunications);cache;cluster headache;computation (action);computation offloading;convex optimization;digital distribution;duplex (telecommunications);edge computing;financial cost;mathematical optimization;multicast;optimization problem;remote audio output protocol;resource allocation;scheduling (computing);scheduling - hl7 publishing domain;simulation;social characteristics;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;contents - htmllinktype	Dongyu Wang;Yanwen Lan;Tiezhu Zhao;Zhenping Yin;Xiaoxiang Wang	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2876893	computer network;multicast;scheduling (computing);cache;mobile edge computing;distributed computing;computer science;computation offloading;resource allocation;optimization problem;spectral efficiency	Metrics	29.850890685945025	93.21139505052321	39920

Given the rigidity of current allocations, several spectrum occupancy studies have indicated a low utilization over both space and time. Hence, to satisfy the demands of applications it can be inferred that dynamic spectrum usage is a required necessity. Centralized Dynamic Spectrum Allocation (DSA) and Distributed Dynamic Spectrum Selection (DSS) are two paradigms that aim to address this problem, whereby we use DSS (distributed) as an umbrella term for a range of terminologies for decentralized access, such as Opportunistic Spectrum Access and Dynamic Spectrum Access. This paper presents a survey on these methods, whereby we introduce, discuss, and classify several proposed architectures, techniques and solutions. Corresponding challenges from a technical point of view are also investigated, as are some of the remaining open issues. The final and perhaps most significant contribution of this work is to provide a baseline for systematically comparing the two approaches, revealing the pros and cons of DSA (centralized) and DSS (distributed) as methods of realizing spectrum sharing.	baseline (configuration management);centralized computing;collegehumor;mathematical optimization;pareto efficiency;requirement;software deployment;spectral efficiency;umbrella term	Gbenga Salami;Olasunkanmi Durowoju;Alireza Attar;Oliver Holland;Rahim Tafazolli;Hamid Aghvami	2011	IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials	10.1109/SURV.2011.041110.00018	spectrum management;spectrum;cognitive radio;explosive material;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;decision support system;telecommunications;computer science;interference;terminology;computer security;time division multiple access;computer network;satisfiability	Mobile	26.724340287944784	94.16860089364542	40776
40a4ffd4baa2f4f936395d49857bab67fca63183	a primary user emulation attack countermeasure strategy and energy-efficiency analysis in cognitive radio networks		Due to the fact that security and energy efficiency are investigated separately in the conventional Primary User Emulation Attack (PUEA) countermeasure strategy in Cooperative Spectrum Sensing (CSS) process, the tradeoff between security and energy efficiency is discussed in this paper. CSS can improve detection performance whereas energy consumption will dramatically boost up with the increasing of cooperative users. To tackle this problem, we set CSS energy efficiency in the presence of PUEA as optimal objective, whereas secure detection performance and secure false alarm threshold as the constraint conditions. The optimal problem is resolved to achieve a trade-off between energy efficiency and security in the presence of PUEA attack. The optimal fusion threshold K and optimal cooperative user numbers can be obtained in secure CSS with energy efficiency maximization, which guarantees energy efficiency as well as secure CSS detection performance. The proposed PUEA countermeasure strategy detection performance is presented and compared with traditional Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC) fusion rule. Simulation results show that, the proposed strategy is immune to PUE interference power, and it provides high robustness to PUEA attack, which implements the trade-off between security and energy efficiency in Cognitive Radio Network (CRN) effectively.	cascading style sheets;cognitive radio;emulator;expectation–maximization algorithm;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;optimization problem;phy (chip);power usage effectiveness;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;superuser	Yunchuan Wang;Xiaorong Xu;Weiwei Wu;Jianrong Bao	2017	JCM	10.12720/jcm.12.1.1-7	computer network;cognitive radio;efficient energy use;distributed computing;computer science;emulation;countermeasure	Mobile	35.27415270639661	95.7978104485949	40816

To optimize the overall utility of a cooperative CRN, we first investigate the cooperation between a single pair of PU and SU with Stackelberg game model, where PU determines access time allocation while SU determines relaying power for the PU. Based on the analytical results, cooperation pairing between multiple PUs and SUs is modeled as a bipartite matching problem and solved using Gale-Shapley algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that, with the proposed schemes, overall utility for PUs and SUs can be balanced with low computational complexity.	access time;algorithm;cognitive radio;computational complexity theory;ibm systems network architecture;matching (graph theory);numerical method;one-class classification;pareto efficiency;relay;simulation;stable marriage problem;superuser;throughput	Lifeng Hao;Sixing Yin;Zhaowei Qu	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-40352-6_5	simulation;telecommunications;engineering;communication	AI	32.04427366794091	93.72586585424713	41137

In the recent years many researchers have proposed different approaches to minimize energy consumption in LTEA according to mobile users' point of view. In this paper we analyze the energy consumption of the network according to the operators' point of views. Network sharing and the Self Organized Network (SON) technologies are attractive solutions for cost reduction, and minimizing energy utilization in LTEA. The purpose of this paper is to provide a novel framework for minimizing energy cost per bit and assist with Self Organized Load Balancing algorithm (SO-LB) in shared network. Simulation results show that, by employing SO-LB in a shared network, it is possible to save 15-20% of the energy normally consumed in the LTEA non shared networks.	algorithm;lattice boltzmann methods;load balancing (computing);point of view (computer hardware company);simulation	Shahid Mumtaz;Valdemar Monteiro;Jonathan Rodriguez;Christos Politis	2012	2012 International Conference on Telecommunications and Multimedia (TEMU)	10.1109/TEMU.2012.6294729	simulation;energy;energy conservation;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;load balancing;distributed computing;quantum mechanics;computer network	HPC	24.703000184019146	92.83879068423144	41240

This downlink scenario is more difficult to handle than its uplink counterpart, since all users are coupled by transmit filters and powers. Our main result is to show that downlink and uplink share the same normalized MSE achievable region under a sum power constraint. Thus, the problem of downlink transmitter design can be solved by focusing on an equivalent uplink problem, which has a more suitable structure and allows for efficient algorithmic solutions. As application examples, we solve the problem of minimizing the maximal normalized MSE of all users (fairness), and the problem of minimizing the sum of all normalized MSE (overall efficiency).	fairness measure;mimo;mathematical optimization;maximal set;mean squared error;multi-user;multipoint ground;point-to-multipoint communication;telecommunications link;transmitter	Shuying Shi;Martin Schubert	2005	Proceedings.

We use the theory of non-cooperative games to propose a distributed framework to optimize the covariance matrices of the information signal and AN at each link. To tackle the non-convexity of each link/player's optimization problem, we recruit a relaxed equilibrium concept in game theory, called quasi-Nash equilibrium (QNE). Under the assumption of no coordination between links, we derive sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the resulting QNE. It turns out that the uniqueness of QNE is not always guaranteed, especially in the case of high interference. Hence, multiple QNEs might exist, and an ordinary updating process (e.g., Gauss-Seidel, Jacobi, or asynchronous update) does not guarantee the convergence to a QNE. Instead, by using the Tikhonov regularization method for variational inequality problems, we modify our algorithm to guarantee the game's convergence to a QNE even in the case of having multiple QNEs. The modified algorithm also allows the links to select between multiple QNEs so as to reduce the received interference at the legitimate receivers. Simulations are then used to confirm the above theoretical findings and the efficacy (in terms of secrecy sum-rate, convergence guarantee, and energy efficiency) of the latter algorithm.	algorithm;arc (programming language);calculus of variations;computer simulation;critical section;game theory;gauss–seidel method;ibm notes;interference (communication);jacobi method;loss function;mimo;mathematical optimization;matrix regularization;nash equilibrium;optimization problem;overhead (computing);selection algorithm;social inequality;the australian;variational inequality	Peyman Siyari;Marwan Krunz;Diep N.

To account for interferenc constraints of this type, we consider a flexible spectrum access pricing scheme that charges SUs based on the interfer ence that they cause to the system’s PUs (individually, globally, or both), and we examine how SUs can maximize their achievable transmission rate in this setting. We show that the resulting non-cooperative game admits a unique Nas h equilibrium under very mild assumptions on the pricing mechanism employed by the network operator, and under both s tatic and ergodic (fast-fading) channel conditions. In addition, we derive a dynamic power allocation policy that c onverges to equilibrium within a few iterations (even for large numbers of users), and which relies only on local signa l-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) measurements; importantly, the proposed algorithm retains its convergen ce properties even in the ergodic channel regime, despite the inherent stochasticity thereof. Our theoretical analy sis is complemented by extensive numerical simulations whi ch illustrate the performance and scalability properties of t he proposed pricing scheme under realistic network conditi ons.	cognitive radio;ergodicity;expectation–maximization algorithm;interference (communication);iteration;numerical analysis;scalability;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;throughput	Salvatore D'Oro;Panayotis Mertikopoulos;Aris L.

This paper combines D2D technology with the traditional cellular network to form a hybrid network to improve video subscriber users’ experience. The proposed scheme is formulated into a joint mode selection, resource, and power allocation problem based on interference mitigation, which is proven to be NP-hard. Then, we divide it into two sub-problems, where the first one is model selection to maximize the number of D2D users who can access the systems, and the other is to assign appropriate MCS and resource blocks to each video layer. To solve these two problems, we present a greedy algorithm and a heuristic algorithm, respectively. Simulation results show that our hybrid cellular and D2D communications network can effectively increase the capacity of system users, and the mixed network video multicast model can improve the overall system throughput while providing better video quality.

22bb2e784bd1c8db33054cdf51d727080c94d779	cooperative beamforming for cognitive radio systems with multiple primary and secondary receivers in presence of asynchronous interferences		In this paper, we develop a cooperative beamforming technique for a cooperative cognitive radio (CR) system with multiple secondary cooperative transmitters (SCTs), secondary receivers (SRs) and primary receivers (PRs) in presence of asynchronous interferences. The objective of the beamforming technique is to maximize the minimum data rate of the SRs subject to transmission power constraints at the SCTs as well as asynchronous interference power constraints at the PRs. The optimal beamforming design is a quadratically constrained quadratic program max-min optimization problem, which is non-convex and non-linear. Therefore, we reformulate the optimal beamforming design as a quasi-convex problem by using the so-called semidefinite program (SDP) relaxation technique that can be solved using the standard SDP solvers and bisection method. However, the computational complexity of the optimal beamforming technique is high. Therefore, we study important properties of the optimization problem and propose a low complexity suboptimal beamfoming technique by using the properties.	beamforming;bisection method;cognitive radio;computational complexity theory;convex function;convex optimization;cooperative mimo;data rate units;elegant degradation;interference (communication);linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;optimization problem;quadratic programming;quadratically constrained quadratic program;semidefinite programming;transmitter	Selvakumar Tharranetharan;Md.

The satisfaction oriented resource allocation (SORA) algorithm, based on low complexity heuristics, divides the users into two sets: satisfied and unsatisfied. Then, it performs resource allocation taking advantage of channel frequency selectivity and the characteristics of each set. The main advantage of the proposed algorithm is the capacity of keeping a high number of users satisfied by resources from users that would be unsatisfied in any case.	algorithm;channel capacity;frequency divider;heuristic (computer science);proportionally fair;quality of service;requirement;schedule (project management);scheduling (computing);selectivity (electronic);simulation;throughput	Ricardo B. dos Santos;Francisco Rafael Marques Lima;Walter C.

With virtualization, resource utilization is higher, system performance is improved and the investment capital is lower. However, there are remaining challenges to be addressed before wireless virtualization is widespread deployed. One challenge is user association which has great influence on the performance of the wireless virtualization network. Traditionally, user associates to the base station (BS) who provides the highest signal to interference plus noise ratio (max-SINR). However, this scheme may not guarantee the quality of service (QoS) of users and backhaul constraint of infrastructure providers (InPs). This motivates us to investigate the user association problem in virtualized cellular networks in this paper. We formulate the user-BS association as a matching game. We show that the preferences used to rank one another are independent and affected by the existing matching. Therefore, this game can be classified as the one-to-many matching game with externalities. In addition, we present a distributed algorithm to find the stable outcome of this game. Simulation results show that the presented association scheme is better than traditional scheme.	backhaul (telecommunications);distributed algorithm;interdependence;interference (communication);matching (graph theory);one-to-many (data model);quality of service;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;wireless access point	Tra Huong Thi Le;Nguyen H.

This distribution is trivial in single-technology systems but remains unresolved for heterogeneous wireless systems. This letter addresses this allocation problem not paying attention to the weights calculation, because this issue has been widely studied in the past. The novel proportionally fair scheduler for heterogeneous wireless systems (PFS-H) is based on linear programming and allocates any arbitrary resource quantity to users that are simultaneously served by several technologies. Given a priority list, the solution of the optimisation problem divides users and technologies into clusters to perform the fairest allocation of resources among users while maximising its usage. Results show that the PFS-H improves fairness up to 60% as compared with a single-technology policy.

In such systems, in fact, many users transmit over the same radio channel using the same frequency band and time slots so that the signal of an individual user becomes interference for the other users. Hence the transmission power levels need to be smartly manipulated so as to achieve an adequate quality of service for as many users as possible and, thus, an efficient network utilization. Conventional power control algorithms adopt the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) as controlled variable and neglect the important effects of the manipulated control variables (transmission powers) and of the retransmission mechanism on the queueing dynamics. In this paper, we pursue a different queue-based approach which takes into account the queuing dynamics and adopts the queue size as controlled variable. In particular, a novel queue-based power control algorithm with low on-line computational burden is proposed and its performance is evaluated both theoretically and via simulation experiments.	algorithmic efficiency;centralized computing;computation;distributed algorithm;experiment;frequency band;game theory;interference (communication);online and offline;optimal control;performance evaluation;programming paradigm;quality of service;retransmission (data networks);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;subject matter expert turing test;telecommunications network	Luigi Chisci;Romano Fantacci;Lorenzo Mucchi;Tommaso Pecorella	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2006.255446	signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;in situ resource utilization;quality of service;telecommunications;power control;computer science;resource management;frequency;signal-to-noise ratio;radio frequency;bandwidth;wireless;computer network	Mobile	29.03274695649117	94.534896677337	42582

This mapping, however, cannot be selected arbitrarily. Together with the signals from the other network relays, it has to allow the destinations to be able to recover the source data from the available observations. Moreover the mapping should optimize a local relay utility function. This task can be easily solved in centralized networks. In decentralized ones, such as sensor or smart metering networks, a mapping assignment should be derived from mutual node communication, cooperation and/or signaling. In this paper we focus on the practical hardware implementation of such a distributed algorithm called a Distributed Learning Algorithm (DLA). In a two source, two relay and two destination network scenario we have implemented a non-cooperative game-based process that selects the WPLNC mapping of each individual relay node guaranteeing invertibility of WPLNC at the destinations as well as optimizing the relay's utility function, namely the output modulation cardinality. The implementation testbed is based on Software Defined Radio (SDR) modules and it is used to verify the algorithm properties in real-world conditions.	centralized computing;distributed algorithm;drive letter assignment;etsi satellite digital radio;linear network coding;linear programming relaxation;local optimum;modulation;mutual exclusion;optimization problem;relay;relay channel;sensor;smart meter;source data;testbed;utility	Tomas Hynek;David Halls;Jan Sýkora	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)	10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247496	synchronization;transmitter;wireless wan;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;phase-shift keying;wireless network;wireless;computer network	Mobile	36.970367311259885	89.0649103801992	42818
30fd46ce4015b6809a0f15139b3c552ab0e16b8d	a decentralized reciprocity calibration approach for cooperative mimo		As a key technology to improve the coverage and throughput of distributed wireless network, cooperative multiple-input multiple-output (CO-MIMO) system jointly manipulates the precoders of multiple distributed base stations (BSs) to serve multiple mobile stations, simultaneously. However, in time division duplexing mode, independent ambiguity multiplicative factors induced by practical transceiver radio frequency circuits will break the reciprocity between the uplink–downlink channels, resulting in the failure of cooperative precoding in multiple BSs. In this paper, we develop an efficient decentralized reciprocity calibration approach with low overhead and complexity for CO-MIMO systems. Specifically, the calibration problem of CO-MIMO is first modeled as a least square (LS) problem. Based on the decomposition theory, the LS problem is decomposed into a master problem and several subproblems. In order to avoid gathering channel state information from distributed BSs, the master problem is solved jointly and iteratively at the BSs’ side, while the subproblems are solved independently at each BS. According to the decomposition results and the solving strategy, the calibration process is described as a decentralized algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate that better performance could be achieved compared with the centralized approach.

We present an artificial intelligence (AI) case based reasoning (CBR) framework that enables autonomous self-deployment in which the network can learn the environment by means of sensing and perception. New actions, i.e. extender positions, are created by problem-specific optimization and semisupervised learning algorithms that balance exploration and exploitation of the search space. An IEEE 802.11 standard compliant simulations are performed to evaluate the framework on a large scale and compare its performance against existing conventional coverage maximization approaches. Experimental evaluation is also performed in an enterprise environment to demonstrate the competence of the proposed AI-framework in perceiving such a dense scenario and reason the extender deployment that achieves user quality of service (QoS). Throughput fairness and ubiquitous QoS satisfaction are achieved which provide a leap to apply AI-driven self-deployment in wireless networks.	artificial intelligence;autonomous robot;backhaul (telecommunications);case-based reasoning;digital media player;expectation–maximization algorithm;fairness measure;machine learning;mathematical optimization;quality of service;semi-supervised learning;simulation;software deployment;throughput	Erma Perenda;Ramy Atawia;Haris Gacanin	2018	CoRR		software deployment;computer network;throughput;wireless network;wireless;distributed computing;computer science;quality of service;case-based reasoning;artificial intelligence;maximization;extender	AI	25.31827226674621	95.34019847587916	43087

We consider a point-to-multipoint (PMP) WiMAX network where base station (BS) schedules downlink packets for simultaneous transmissions to multiple users using the WiMAX OFDMA system. WiMAX OFDMA standard specifies several subcarrier permutation options, such as the partial usage of subcarriers (PUSC), full usage of subcarrier (FUSC), and the band adaptive modulation and coding (band-AMC) among others, for mapping the physical subcarriers into logical subchannels assigned to users by the BS schedulers. In this paper, we propose the use of threshold testing prior to the process of subchannel assignment to users by the BS scheduler, as a means of throughput enhancement. In the proposed threshold-based multiuser scheduling scheme, the BS scheduler selects at any time instant users whose channel gains in the available subchannels equal or exceed a predetermined energy threshold. Thus, only users who can maximize BS throughput on the available subchannels are assigned data transmission opportunities which enhance the BS data rate, albeit at the expense of fairness to users. We quantify the throughput enhancement of the proposed system and illustrate its benefits by numerical simulations.	computer simulation;data rate units;digital subchannel;fairness measure;multi-user;multipoint ground;numerical analysis;point-to-multipoint communication;scheduling (computing);telecommunications link;throughput	Ahmed Iyanda Sulyman	2011	EURASIP J.

In this paper, HARQ timing issue in LTE system is investigated and novel HARQ feedback signalling design schemes for dynamic TDD system are proposed.

In this paper, we propose a Location-aware Online Truthful doUble auction Scheme (LOTUS), which incorporates the buyers' location information into auction mechanism design. In the online auction, the biggest challenge is how to allocate the spectrums based on the knowledge in the current time slot, without knowing the spectrum requests that may come afterward. To solve this problem, we propose considering the opportunity cost of allocating the spectrum to a buyer based on his local interference conditions. We introduce the “interference discount” to markdown a buyer's bid if he induces a wide range of interference. Furthermore, we take into account the spectrum heterogeneity and design mechanisms that guarantee the economic robustness of the auction. The simulation results show that LOTUS outperforms the existing online auction mechanism, significantly improving buyers' and sellers' utility.	interference (communication);simulation	Yanjiao Chen;Peng Lin;Qian Zhang	2014	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/DySPAN.2014.6817834	combinatorial auction;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;resource management;interference;wireless;cost accounting;bandwidth allocation	Mobile	30.02261158355499	95.70743639430029	43210

In [1], coordinated port selection was shown to achieve significant performance gains. However, in the system considered therein, the ports in each cell were constrained to transmit only to user terminals (UTs) in that cell. In this work, we consider a generalization of the problem considered in [1] by alleviating this constraint. We formulate the problem of determining the ports that maximize the minimum signal to interference plus noise ratio observed by the UTs as a binary-constrained optimization problem. Observing that it is NP-hard, we propose a semidefinite relaxation and Gaussian randomization based technique to obtain close-to-optimal solutions. Our simulation results show that the performance achieved by the proposed technique approaches that of the optimal solution. It is also shown that the proposed technique outperforms the one in [1], particularly for cell-edge UTs, albeit with an increased computational complexity.	computational complexity theory;constrained optimization;constraint (mathematics);gaussian blur;interference (communication);linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;np-hardness;optimization problem;relaxation (approximation);semidefinite programming;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;telecommunications link	Gurhan Bulu;Talha Ahmad;Ramy H.

Further, (the receivers of) mobile users dynamically time-share between the cellular and D2D networks. We develop algorithms for channel allocation and mobile-user receiver mode selection (choosing which network to participate in) with the objectives of minimizing delay for cellular traffic, and capacity maximization for D2D traffic. Our proposed solution takes advantage of the unique features offered by large and densified cellular networks such as multi-point connectivity, channel diversity, spatial reuse and load distribution. Given a BS-to-mobile delay requirement of d + 1 time-slots, we show that by appropriately scheduling channels and receiver modes, we can (with exponentially high probability) guarantee that cellular traffic reaches its intended destination within d timeslots. By leveraging spatial channel reuse, we show that this is achieved by utilizing a vanishingly small fraction of the available spatial capacity. Further, in the presence of delay-constrained cellular traffic, our scheduling algorithm guarantees D2D traffic can achieve rates within a (1-1/d) factor of the corresponding achievable rates without cellular traffic.	expectation–maximization algorithm;ibm notes;load balancing (computing);multitier architecture;norm (social);scheduling (computing);set packing;spatial capacity;tier 1 network	Subhashini Krishnasamy;Sanjay Shakkottai	2015	2015 13th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks (WiOpt)	10.1109/WIOPT.2015.7151087	cellular traffic;real-time computing;mobile telephony;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;resource management;operating system;interference;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	29.58165169563164	91.2779854961122	43412

Cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) has been adopted to exploit spatial diversity in cognitive radio networks (CRNs). Since CSS is subject to attacks from malicious users, several secure schemes have been proposed recently. But, they only utilize current information to estimate the reliability of secondary users. In this paper, we propose a trustworthy CSS scheme based on Dempster-Shafer theory. It evaluates the trustworthiness degree of each user with two indicators, which are the current reliability and the historical reputation. Besides, it takes advantage of Dempster-Shafer theory's ability to reflect uncertainty in the evaluation as well. Simulation results have shown that the proposed scheme is effective to counter with different attacks patterns.	cascading style sheets;cognitive radio;cooperative mimo;simulation;trust (emotion);trustworthy computing	Shuo Feng;Xueqiang Zheng;Ran Liu;Juan Chen;Suqin Xu;Linyuan Zhang	2014	2014 IEEE/ACIS 13th International Conference on Computer and Information Science (ICIS)	10.1109/ICIS.2014.6912099	cognitive radio;dempster–shafer theory;telecommunications;computer science;information security;computer security	Mobile	47.767873316263255	88.8034800389139	43452

In the proposed system, only one SU is assigned to a particular band. The optimization problem used to obtain the stability region's envelope (closure) is shown to be a linear program. We compare the stability region of the proposed system with that of a system where each SU chooses a band randomly with some assignment probability. We also compare with a fixed (deterministic) assignment system, where only one SU is assigned to one of the primary bands all the time.

Each cell is partitioned into three sectors. All the available subcarriers are divided into two groups. One is reused in the central region of the sectors, and another is divided into three parts used orthogonally for the edge of the three sectors (no overlap). Which subcarrier group a user can use is dependent on the location or the received signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) of the user. Thus, intra-cell orthogonality is guaranteed, and inter-cell interference can be greatly reduced. All the subcarriers may use the same transmit power in this scheme. Simulation results show that this scheme can bring higher system throughput and lower CCI, and it also can increase the data rate at the cell edge.	allan variance;channel capacity;controlled cryptographic item;data rate units;disk sector;frequency divider;interference (communication);multiplexing;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;subcarrier;throughput;uncompressed video	Haipeng Lei;Lei Zhang;Xin Zhang;Dacheng Yang	2007	2007 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2007.4394228	signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;frequency allocation;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;co-channel interference;wireless	Arch	28.647682013354736	89.33893587483148	43674

This assumption has been proven to be very reasonable when circuit voice was the dominant service and backhaul capacity provisioning in BS accounting for the peak rate of the radio link was an economically feasible option. However, as traffic continues increasing and enhanced air interfaces are been deployed, a growing concern is that also the mobile backhauling can become a bottleneck in certain deployment scenarios. In this paper we present a BS assignment algorithm designed to optimize radio resource usage while simultaneously considering potential capacity limitations in mobile backhauls. The BS assignment problem is formulated using a cost-based framework and mapped into a Multiple-Choice Multidimensional Knapsack Problem (MMKP) that is solved by means of a heuristic algorithm with polynomial time. The proposed algorithm is evaluated and compared to two schemes based exclusively on radio conditions. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can assign more users than existing algorithms without violating radio and transport constraints in partially backhaul limited scenarios.	algorithm;assignment problem;backhaul (telecommunications);heuristic (computer science);knapsack problem;provisioning;simulation;software deployment;time complexity	Hiram Galeana-Zapién;Francisco Novillo;Ramon Ferrús	2008	IEEE GLOBECOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.965	cellular network;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	25.52465780592988	93.55891086669995	44246

The randomized UCRC design is modeled as a multi-timescale non-convex problem to optimize the average weighted sum rate (WSR). We first decompose the problem into short-term precoding and medium-term UCRC subproblems. Then we propose a low complexity algorithm which finds the optimal solution for week interference regime and achieves good performance for general cases. Finally, we exploit PHY caching at RRH node of the C-RAN to reduce the fronthaul loading. We show that there is a phase transition of the PHY caching gain according to the skewness of the popularity distribution. Specifically, when the skewness parameter is larger than 1, a large saving in C-RAN fronthaul loading is possible even when the RRH cache capacity is small compared to the total content size.	c-ran;cache (computing);cluster analysis;convex optimization;interference (communication);phy (chip);radio access network;randomized algorithm;remote radio head;waist-to-height ratio;weight function	An Liu;Vincent K.

d8c7c7a2c5bfb6cb03ab8f4a03dfacd507ad7b75	a base station dtx scheme for ofdma cellular networks powered by the smart grid		Discontinuous transmission (DTX) is an efficient technology to improve the energy efficiency of the wireless cellular networks. DTX enables the deactivation of some components of the base station in sufficient short time, which can decrease the energy consumption without affecting the normal operation of the mobile networks. In addition, we consider distributed smart grid which can power the cellular networks using renewable and conventional energy. The distributed smart grid has many different energy retailers with variant energy resource, such as solar energy, wind energy, and conventional energy. Comparing with conventional energy, the renewable energy is more environmental friendly, but more expensive. As a result, it is necessary to obtain a good tradeoff between the operation cost and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. In this paper, we jointly optimize the DTX, resource allocation, and smart grid energy procurement to maximize the profit of the network operators and minimize the GHG emission. We formulate the joint optimization problem as a mixed integer programming problem. By exploiting the structure of the coupled constraint of the problem, we propose a suboptimal distributed algorithm based on the Lagrangian dual method, and the algorithm can be performed at cellular network and smart grid alternately, which can significantly decrease the signaling and computational overhead. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed DTX scheme can significantly enhance the energy saving, and further improve the energy efficiency of the cellular networks.

269f3689ba9cebb4b84945325174c23f8f61a64a	mu-mimo resource optimization for device-to-device underlay downlink cellular networks		Device-to-Device (D2D) is an emerging technology that is typically employed as an underlay of the uplink (UL) cellular networks. The downlink cellular spectrum, however, is rarely reused by D2D links due to the strong interference from the base station to the D2D receivers. To this end, we propose to enable D2D transmissions in the downlink by multiplexing D2D and cellular users using beamforming techniques. In particular, a cross-layer design approach is adopted to jointly optimize beamforming, spectrum allocation, and power control, so that the total system transmission power is minimized. To deal with the non-convex and combinatorial nature of the problem, we transform the formulation into a convex optimization problem by identical deformation and relaxations, and propose a semidefinite relaxation (SDR) based algorithm to approximate the optimal solution. Moreover, we focus on the feasibility of the convex problem, and propose an improved algorithm which reduces the probability of users out of service. The simulation results show that the performance of our proposed algorithm is close to the optimal solution, and the improved algorithm gives a higher efficiency on user admission control.	approximation algorithm;beamforming;convex optimization;etsi satellite digital radio;frequency allocation;interference (communication);linear programming relaxation;mimo;mathematical optimization;multiplexing;optimization problem;quadratically constrained quadratic program;relaxation (approximation);simulation;telecommunications link	Chen Xu;Lingyang Song;Yingjun Angela Zhang	2014	2015 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7417831	telecommunications;power control;computer science;radio resource management;resource management;interference;computer network	Mobile	31.354161827471117	91.8669918893056	45382

HetNets necessitate optimal power allocation, spectrum resource allocation, and cell selection to meet the quality of service requirements. In this paper, we formulate energy efficiency maximization problem in terms of resource allocation and cell selection for HetNets, where objective is to maximize the network throughput per unit network power consumption. Formulated optimization problem is non-linear fractional programming problem. We use Charnes-Cooper transformation to convert proposed fractional programming problem into concave optimization problem. We propose outer approximation algorithm (OAA) to solve the converted concave optimization problem. The proposed algorithm is evaluated by extensive simulation work. The performance of ε-optimal solution obtained by OAA method is shown for different network parameters, such as number of users, required date rate, and capacity of network.	approximation algorithm;concave function;entropy maximization;fifth generation computer;fractional programming;linear-fractional programming;mathematical optimization;non-functional requirement;nonlinear system;open agent architecture;optimization problem;relay;simulation;throughput	Mudassar Ali;Saad B.

However, when the received PU signal is weak, spectrum sensing by individual SUs becomes unreliable. To improve sensing accuracy, SUs can form disjoint coalitions and cooperate to discover idle time slots. These spectrum opportunities are then shared among the coalition members in a coordinated manner. It is proposed to decouple the coalition formation and the access (payoff) allocation problems by modeling these processes as a two-layer coalitional game. This game fosters cooperation by providing each SU with the access opportunities it deserves. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed game outperforms previously investigated collaborative sensing and access approaches in terms of energy efficiency, throughput, and fairness.	cognitive radio;fairness measure;ibm systems network architecture;one-class classification;superuser;throughput	Yuan Lu;Alexandra Duel-Hallen	2015	2015 49th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)	10.1109/CISS.2015.7086824	cognitive radio;simulation;telecommunications;computer security	Mobile	32.630973690934425	94.73105307219667	45952

Monotonicity is one of the most important and fundamental characteristics of a function, which can be exploited to derive and analyze the optimal solutions. In this paper, we discover that in several cases taking advantage of the monotonicity in the field of positive semidefinite matrices, the considered optimization problems can be significantly simplified e.g., the dimensionality of the variables are reduced from matrix variates to be vector ones with much lower dimensionality. We believe that just like convexity, monotonicity, especially for positive semi-definite matrices, will have a critical role in the future wireless designs.	convex function;derive;mimo;mathematical optimization;semiconductor industry;semidefinite programming;monotone	Chengwen Xing;Shaodan Ma;Yiqing Zhou	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Communication Systems	10.1109/ICCS.2014.7024785	matrix splitting;matrix analysis;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;eigendecomposition of a matrix;sparse matrix;linear matrix inequality;matrix multiplication;linear programming;mathematics;state-transition matrix;matrix decomposition;semidefinite programming;transceiver;mimo	Robotics	38.24685787178889	91.3090169222783	46159

In the system with MRSs, some of mobile stations (MSs) can act as relay stations (RSs) that forward other MSs data from/to the base station (BS). Compared with the fixed RSs, MRSs have several advantages such as low deployment costs and high flexibility. In this paper, we study an opportunistic subchannel scheduling in orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) cellular networks with MRSs. We formulate a stochastic optimization problem to maximize the sum-rate of the system with MRSs while satisfying the minimum average data rate requirement for each MS, and then develop an optimal opportunistic subchannel scheduling algorithm by solving it. Through simulation results, we show the performances of our algorithm.	algorithm;broadcast relay station;crew scheduling;data rate units;digital subchannel;entropy maximization;frequency divider;linear function;mathematical optimization;multidimensional digital pre-distortion;norm (social);numerical method;optimization problem;p (complexity);performance;powerpc 400;quality of service;roland gs;scheduling (computing);scott continuity;simulation;software deployment;spectral efficiency;stochastic optimization;subderivative;subgradient method;telecommunications link	Jee-Hun Song;Hee-Tae Roh;Jang-Won Lee	2014	2014 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)	10.1109/ICTC.2014.6983168	fair-share scheduling;cellular network;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	31.438617475573942	91.31700975156936	46510

623d1fbcdd0c5d60901bd130726bfe5955a1031f	spatial deep learning for wireless scheduling.		The optimal scheduling of interfering links in a dense wireless network with full frequency reuse is a challenging task. The traditional method involves first estimating all the interfering channel strengths then optimizing the scheduling based on the model. This model-based method is however resource intensive and computationally hard, because channel estimation is expensive in dense networks; further, finding even a locally optimal solution of the resulting optimization problem may be computationally complex. This paper shows that by using a deep learning approach, it is possible to bypass channel estimation and to schedule links efficiently based solely on the geographic locations of transmitters and receivers for networks in which the channels are largely functions of distance dependent path-losses. This is accomplished by unsupervised training over randomly deployed networks, and by using a novel neural network architecture that takes the geographic spatial convolutions of the interfering or interfered neighboring nodes as input over multiple feedback stages to learn the optimum solution. The resulting neural network gives near-optimal performance for sum-rate maximization and is capable of generalizing to larger deployment areas and to deployments of different link densities. Moreover, to provide fairness, this paper proposes a novel scheduling approach that utilizes the sum-rate optimal scheduling algorithm over judiciously chosen subsets of links for maximizing a proportional fairness objective over the network. The proposed approach shows highly competitive and generalizable network utility maximization results.

The proposed target function is the weighted sum rate, which preserves relative QoS between users. Being the overall problem non-convex in terms of transmitted power, we propose to solve it distributedly, where each femto access point (FAP) optimizes a convex function for some measured interference levels. If the optimization is done independently at each FAP, we can formulate the overall problem as a non-cooperative game where each action is taken as a selfish response to the own FAP channel states and to the interference generated by other FAP decisions. The resulting iterative waterfilling algorithm provides a local optimum solution which is known to be far from optimal efficiency, in general. Alternatively, a better solution can be found by coordinating the FAPs in terms of exchanging interference prices. Assuming that the air interface could provide much larger spectral efficiency than the Internet Service Provider (ISP) wired connection, the problem solved at each FAP must include restrictions on the sum rate perceived by the femto users (FUEs). Numerical results compare gains obtained by pricing exchange and from pure competition in dense FAP deployments.	algorithm;centralisation;convex function;face animation parameter;interference (communication);iterative method;local optimum;mimo;mathematical optimization;quality of service;self-organization;semiconductor industry;spectral efficiency;system analysis;telecommunications link;weight function;wireless access point	Adrian Agustin;Josep Vidal;Olga Muñoz	2011	2011 Future Network & Mobile Summit		electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	Mobile	31.56381944601691	92.94669268472941	46654

First, the comprehensive analysis is carried out to derive that the LTE transmission failure caused by the IDC interference from WiFi radio is related to the number of sub-frames overlapped with the WiFi transmission (called overlapped sub-frame). After that, consider the number of the detected overlapped subframes may be larger than that used to declare the serious IDC interference, an enhanced scheme is proposed to allow the enhanced NodeB (eNB) inform UE the threshold on the number of detected overlapped sub-frames. The numerical and simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme can largely reduce the detection overhead.	coexist (image);compaq lte;data center;failure rate;interference (communication);numerical analysis;overhead (computing);simulation	Weiwei Wang;Yanling Lu;Haibo Xu;Hua Zhou	2012	2012 IEEE 75th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VETECS.2012.6240034	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;co-channel interference;computer network	Mobile	25.41140635488887	88.60379607359249	46752
cb9076446ca415cd8da70e5e2ce3f9b7b932af5a	resource allocation for energy harvesting assisted d2d communications underlaying ofdma cellular networks		Device-to-Device (D2D) communications underlaying cellular communications has been explored in the literature for a while since the benefits of enhanced sum throughput and more efficient spectrum usage have been proven very promising through the activation of direct transmissions between a pair of devices. To achieve better performance in terms of energy preservation, we consider introducing energy harvesting (EH) mechanism into the traditional D2D model. Our aim is to maximize sum throughput for D2D users without compromising the QoS performance of cellular users (CUs) in an EH-aided communications model. D2D transmissions will only be activated at the beginning of a time slot if there remains enough energy, which is set as a lower threshold, for one-slot data transmission in the batteries of D2D users. Otherwise, it will switch into energy harvesting mode until the energy level in the batteries rises back to an upper threshold. The formulated optimization problem is a nonlinear mixed integer problem. Since it is mathematically challenging to get an optimal solution, we aim for a suboptimal solution with an iterative joint resource block and power resource allocation algorithm. Then we compare this heuristic algorithm with a simplified version where the constraints to make sure that every D2D user has at least one RB for communications are slighted. Numerical simulation results show that energy harvesting mechanism can efficiently power D2D communications underlaying cellular networks. They also corroborate higher sum throughput under different parameter settings of our first proposed approach.	algorithm;energy level;exception handling;exponential hierarchy;heuristic (computer science);iterative method;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;optimization problem;simulation;throughput;transmitter;while	Shuo Yu;Waleed Ejaz;Ling Guan;Alagan Anpalagan	2017	2017 IEEE 86th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2017.8288333	computer network;throughput;heuristic (computer science);resource management;computer science;quality of service;real-time computing;data transmission;cellular network;resource allocation;optimization problem	Mobile	30.817403825238994	91.71829738465591	46935
8dbefdb0587a97a11fa98e2d1051ffb46f29dbf0	inference-based distributed channel allocation in wireless sensor networks		Interference-aware resource allocation of time slots and frequency channels in single-antenna, halfduplex radio wireless sensor networks (WSN) is challenging. Devising distributed algorithms for such task further complicates the problem. This work studies WSN joint time and frequency channel allocation for a given routing tree, such that: a) allocation is performed in a fully distributed way, i.e., information exchange is only performed among neighboring WSN terminals, within communication up to two hops, and b) detection of potential interfering terminals is simplified and can be practically realized. The algorithm imprints space, time, frequency and radio hardware constraints into a loopy factor graph and performs iterative message passing/ loopy belief propagation (BP) with randomized initial priors. Sufficient conditions for convergence to a valid solution are offered, for the first time in the literature, exploiting the structure of the proposed factor graph. Based on theoretical findings, modifications of BP are devised that i) accelerate convergence to a valid solution and ii) reduce computation cost. Simulations reveal promising throughput results of the proposed distributed algorithm, even though it utilizes simplified interfering terminals set detection. Future work could modify the constraints such that other disruptive wireless technologies (e.g., full-duplex radios or network coding) could be accommodated within the same inference framework.	belief propagation;casio loopy;channel (communications);computation;distributed algorithm;duplex (telecommunications);emoticon;factor graph;information exchange;interference (communication);iterative method;linear network coding;message passing;randomized algorithm;routing;software propagation;throughput	Panos N.

0eec896e827539a79b789487b89b4530bb409e54	statistical analysis and optimization of a fifth-percentile user rate constrained design for ffr/sfr-aided ofdma-based cellular networks		Interference mitigation strategies are deemed to play a key role in the context of the next generation (B4G/5G) of multicellular networks based on orthogonal frequency division multiple access. Fractional and soft frequency reuse (FFR, SFR) constitute two powerful mechanisms for intercell interference coordination that have been already adopted by emerging cellular deployments as an efficient way to improve the throughput performance perceived by cell-edge users. This paper presents a novel optimal fifth-percentile user rate constrained design for FFR/SFR-based networks that, by appropriately dimensioning the center and edge regions of the cell, rightly splitting the available bandwidth among these two areas while assigning the corresponding transmit power, allows a tradeoff between cell throughput performance and fairness to be established. To this end, both the cumulative distribution function of the user throughput and the average spectral efficiency of the system are derived assuming the use of the ubiquitous proportional fair scheduling policy. The mathematical framework is then used to obtain numerical results showing that the novel proposed design clearly outperforms previous schemes in terms of throughput fairness control due to a more rational compromise between average cell throughput and cell-edge ICIC.	fair-share scheduling;fairness measure;frequency divider;interference (communication);next-generation network;norm (social);numerical analysis;proportionally fair;scheduling (computing);spectral efficiency;throughput	Jan Garc&#x00ED;a-Morales;Guillem Femenias;Felip Riera-Palou	2018	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2017.2782943	computer network;proportionally fair;throughput;scheduling (computing);computer science;orthogonal frequency-division multiple access;distributed computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;spectral efficiency;bandwidth (signal processing);cellular network	Mobile	28.52896362324442	91.76301180569995	47067
b8acf882defc20e7affc117f9d6ae7e5f942ac87	centralized energy-efficient multiuser multiantenna relaying in next-generation radio access networks		This paper addresses the design of a multiuser relaying subnetwork within a cloud radio access network (C-RAN) from an energy-efficient perspective. In the relaying subnetwork, multiple source–destination pairs communicate with the assistance of multiple remote radio heads (RRHs) connected to the baseband unit pool. Exploiting the flexible centralized processing structure of C-RAN, where RRHs can be adaptively activated/deactivated, we formulate the problem as a quality-of-service (QoS) based network energy minimization problem via joint RRH selection and relaying matrix optimization. Since the resultant optimization problem is nonconvex and mathematically challenging, we propose an iterative solution based on the concept of the re-weighted $l_1$  norm, along with a block-coordinate descent type algorithm. The active RRHs are then determined in a single attempt by thresholding a group sparsity pattern associated with the set of all RRH relaying matrices. To circumvent a potentially undesirable condition, where the selected subset of RRHs fails to simultaneously satisfy all the destination users’ QoS levels, we conceive a UE admission control mechanism for overcoming the associated infeasibility problem. Our simulation results demonstrate the explicit benefits of the proposed design approach, which results in a significantly lower energy consumption of the relaying subnetwork than conventional cooperative relaying.	algorithm;baseband;c-ran;centralized computing;coordinate descent;energy minimization;iterative method;mathematical optimization;multi-user mimo;optimization problem;quality of service;radio access network;remote radio head;resultant;semidefinite programming;simulation;sparse matrix;subnetwork;thresholding (image processing)	Jiaxin Yang;Benoît Champagne;Yulong Zou;Lajos Hanzo Hanzo	2017	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2017.2677880	quality of service;electronic engineering;computer network;cloud computing;radio access network;computer science;admission control;subnetwork;access network;optimization problem;baseband;distributed computing	Vision	31.553016633226317	91.39056025423953	47093

The existing spectrum sensing approaches formed based on quickest detection theory rely on the assumption that the occupancy states of different spectrum bands over a wideband spectrum are statistically independent. This is an assumption that cannot be met in practice, especially in broadband communication schemes in which radio channels are dynamically grouped in bundles and allocated to different users based on the users' traffic needs. As a result of such channel grouping and allocation, the occupancy states of the channels, especially the adjacent ones, are correlated. This paper, in contrast to the existing literature on quickest spectrum sensing, considers a wideband spectrum in which the occupancy states of different channels follow a pre-specified dependency kernel. The objective is to design the quickest spectrum sensing approach for identifying spectrum holes, which aims to minimize the average delay in identifying spectrum opportunities while assuring, in parallel, certain guarantees on the quality of the decision. The closed-form characterization of the optimal sensing scheme is delineated and it is shown that this optimal scheme has low computational complexity.	computational complexity theory;concave function;detection theory;kernel (operating system);linear search;maxima and minima;sampling (signal processing)	Ali Tajer;Javad Heydari	2015	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2451101	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;telecommunications;network switch;computer science;sensor;cognitive neuroscience of visual object recognition;mathematics;correlation	Mobile	38.22964077020375	93.80902762357346	47096

Such adjustment exploits link status and hence, users are aware of channel conditions as they deter- mine the data rates. Users are encouraged to maximize utilities of others as they maximize their own due to forced cooperation resulting from the pricing/costing effect attached to transmit power choices. This is equivalent to super-modular game, thus, network utility maximisation (NUM) problem is formulated and anal- ysed using such tool.	interference (communication)	Fredrick Mzee Awuor;Karim Djouani;Kimutai Kimeli;Dorothy A.

The proposed solution guarantees a minimum spectrum share for each user while also takes advantage of the multicast transmission mode. The presence of multiple antennas in both transmitter and receiver offers spatial diversity to the system along with the frequency diversity added by the OFDMA access scheme. The computational complexity is reduced from exponential to linear and validation of the proposed solution is achieved through various simulation scenarios in comparison with other multicast and unicast reference schemes used in MIMO-OFDMA systems.

We also propose the capacityloss-based and maximum absolute values algorithms to recover the above constraint on the ASF matrix.

We employ two well-known measures to characterize the quality of local utility functions: Price of Anarchy (PoA) and Price of Stability (PoS), which provide a measure the best and worst Nash equilibrium, respectively. Our main results characterize the tradeoff between optimizing the PoA and optimizing the PoS; we show that if optimal PoA (resp. PoS) is achieved, there is a limitation on the achievable PoS (resp. PoA). Further, we show that the Shapley value objective function is the unique rule which optimizes PoA followed by PoS, and the marginal contribution rule is the unique rule which optimizes PoS followed by PoA. Lastly, we show that relaxation in the objective of optimizing PoA impacts the attainable PoS guarantees.	anarchy;linear programming relaxation;loss function;marginal model;nash equilibrium;optimal design;optimization problem;price of stability	Emily Jensen;Jason R.

However, since femtocells and macrocell are deployed into a coexisted heterogeneous network, handoff from macrocell to femtocell turns out to be one of the major design issues to achieve better user experience provided by femtocells. In general, the macrocell user equipment (MUE) selects a handoff target femtocell base station (FBS) in the handoff procedure solely based on the received signal strength indicator (RSSI), signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR), or signal to noise ratio (SNR). Although this approach is very simple and easy to implement, it can result in load imbalance among FBSs. Hence, this paper proposes a novel game-based handoffmechanism that combines the modified Dutch Auction (MDA) and stochastic election process (SEP) to jointly take the uplink and downlink signal qualities and load balance of the handoff candidate FBSs into consideration when selecting handoff target FBS. Besides, in order to speed up the execution of the handoff mechanism and reduce the percentage of handoff failures, the Fast SEP and Go Back B are further developed, respectively. Simulation results confirm that the proposed MDA+Fast SEP+Go Back B handoff mechanism provides better load balance, faster handoff and higher percentage of successful handoffs.	compaq lte;function-behaviour-structure ontology;interference (communication);load balancing (computing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;symantec endpoint protection;telecommunications link;user experience	Chih-Cheng Tseng;Hwang-Cheng Wang;Kuo-Chang Ting;Chih-Chieh Wang;Fang-Chang Kuo	2017	J.

We first model the problem as a utility maximization problem, then, because of the integral nature of association, the problem being NP-hard, we decompose it into two sub-problems: the client association problem on one hand, and the joint airtime sharing and contention resolution problem on the other. We show that, for each fixed association pattern, the corresponding joint airtime sharing and contention resolution problem can be solved in polynomial time. To solve the client association problem, we propose the so-called Swap localized algorithm. The Swap procedure iteratively swaps clients between pairs of neighbour access points (APs) if the swap leads to an improvement in the global utility. Simulation results show that, the proposed algorithm is significantly better than RSSI-based heuristic, and quickly leads to a near-optimal solution.	airtime;algorithm;download;entropy maximization;fairness measure;heuristic;lookup table;maximum throughput scheduling;np-hardness;network utility;paging;polynomial;precomputation;simulation;telecommunications link;throughput;time complexity;wireless access point	Jun Zhang;Jason Min Wang;Ying Wang;Brahim Bensaou	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2013.6655554	time complexity;throughput;real-time computing;telecommunications link;computer science;np-hard;distributed computing;computational complexity theory;bandwidth;wireless;computer network	Robotics	30.86111439804448	92.54868657681568	49136

These VNs share the wireless spectrum and they are supposed to meet various requirements of different SPs. In order to satisfy the requirements such as quality of service (QoS), fairness and isolation, efficient and flexible slicing and scheduling schemes are necessary. In this paper, to meet the different rate requirements of VNs, we propose a novel slicing and scheduling scheme. In this scheme, each VN is assigned a certain number of sub-channels to provide services to its users. This number is changeable, which reflects the dynamic adjustability of our scheme. Scheduling isolation among VNs is realized in this scheme, which means that users in different VNs will not be scheduled together, and different scheduling schemes can be used for different VNs based on our scheme. Simulation results show that our scheme provides a good balance between fairness and throughput. More importantly, it provides an efficient method for meeting different rate targets of VNs.	compaq lte;fairness measure;quality of service;requirement;schedule (project management);scheduling (computing);simulation;telecommunications link;throughput	Mengshi Hu;Yongyu Chang;Yang Sun;Hongdou Li	2016	2016 19th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications (WPMC)		quality of service;throughput;real-time computing;service provider;computer network;virtualization;wireless network;telecommunications link;scheduling (computing);slicing;computer science	Embedded	27.201365672632924	92.59869111736214	49147

In this paper, we study the performance of the spectrum allocation and the system utility of the CoMP systems. First, we combine the hybrid division duplex (HDD) with a CoMP system to form a CoMP–HDD system, for the purpose of guaranteeing the quality demand of the channel state information (CSI) feedback. Second, in order to improve the system utility and the spectrum allocation efficiency of the CoMP–HDD system, we utilize the auction theory for the spectrum allocation. A system utility maximization problem is formulated as an NP-hard problem.

1910cff3643968d5844394ef2bde5997ca6cdf34	energy-efficient power control in interference-limited spectrum sharing networks based on multi-objective optimization		Spectrum sharing networks deployment is considered a promising solution for meeting the exponential increase in demand of data rate in wireless network. However, excessive communication energy consumption and interference is the critical issue, particularly for spectrum sharing networks. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient power control scheme for downlink transmission of interference-limited spectrum sharing networks, which is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem based on pricing function. The pricing function is proposed for controlling the inter-tier interference level. The multi-objective optimization problem, considering the mix-min fairness of smallcells and the inter-tier interference constraint to improve the energy efficiency, is introduced in detail. We deal with this problem by using nondominated sorting genetic algorithm version II (NSGA-II). Simulation results show that the proposed energy-efficient power control scheme achieves remarkably excellent performance, comparable with the existing scheme.	data rate units;experiment;fairness measure;genetic algorithm;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;multi-objective optimization;multistage interconnection networks;multitier architecture;optimization problem;quality of service;simulation;software deployment;sorting;telecommunications link;time complexity	Jiajia Zhu;Run-ze Wu;Ankun Yang;Yanhua He;Hailin Hu;Liangrui Tang	2017	2017 13th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)	10.1109/FSKD.2017.8393227	mathematical optimization;wireless network;power control;genetic algorithm;telecommunications link;energy consumption;electric power system;multi-objective optimization;computer science;optimization problem	Mobile	29.242904645948848	91.70358823530387	49681

The optimal method typically relies on an iterative process that is computationally intensive, and it does not provide insight into the allocation process for higher order M-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations. A sequence of two fast energy allocation algorithms are proposed in this work. First, a basic energy allocation algorithm is developed by solving a simple set of linear equations directly. It is shown to be near-optimal for almost the entire signal-to-noise ratio range. Based on this direct method, we can analyze asymptotic limits of the approximation error, carrier energy, and carrier rate conveniently. Then, we present an advanced algorithm that enhances the performance of the basic algorithm via iteration. The convergence of the advanced algorithm is studied, and an estimate of its computational complexity is derived. It is worthwhile to point out that, while limits for the special case with uniform noise and binary phase-shift keying modulation were studied previously, the derived asymptotic performance here works for a more general case with nonuniform noise and M-QAM constellations. Finally, we examine these limits with several types of multimedia and nonmultimedia sources, and show that our algorithms perform well regardless of the source type.	algorithm;approximation error;computational complexity theory;converge;delta modulation;delta-sigma modulation;direct method in the calculus of variations;iteration;key (cryptography);linear equation;memory management;noise (electronics);quality of service;reduction (complexity);requirement;signal-to-noise ratio;simple set;simulation	Michael A.

We propose in this paper, a strategy to minimize the total transmit power in a decode-and-forward (DF) multi-user, multi-relay cooperative uplink, such that each user satisfies its quality-of-service (QoS) data rate. Each user in the proposed system transmits its own data towards the base station and also serves as a relay for other users. The base station assigns one or more relays to each user in order to minimize total power in the uplink. The relay selection is based upon the instantaneous user to base station channels, inter-user channels and also the target rates of the users. The simulation results indicate significant power savings over a non-cooperative uplink, under proposed joint relay selection and power minimization algorithm in a DF cooperative uplink when using a space-time coded cooperative diversity.	algorithm;cooperative mimo;data rate units;direction finding;hybrid automatic repeat request;iterative method;multi-user;quality of service;relay;simulation;telecommunications link	Kanchan G.

The stochastic optimization model is employed to maximize the network utility, which is defined as the difference between the HetNet's throughput and the total energy consumption cost. In harmony with the hierarchical architecture of HetNet, the problem of stochastic optimization of resource allocation is decomposed into two subproblems by the Lyapunov optimization theory, associated with the flow control in transport layer and the power allocation in physical (PHY) layer, respectively. For avoiding the signaling overhead, outdated dynamic information, and scalability issues, the distributed resource allocation method is developed for solving the two subproblems based on the primal-dual decomposition theory. After that, the adaptive resource allocation algorithm is developed to accommodate the time- varying wireless network only according to the current network state information, i.e. the queue state information (QSI) at radio access networks (RAN) and the channel state information (CSI) of RANs-UE links. The tradeoff between network utility and delay is derived, where the increase of delay is approximately linear in V and the increase of network utility is at the speed of 1/V with a control parameter V .

We can, therefore, intuitively predict the trend that users are expecting to enjoy HD video chats via utilizing their smartphones. Most of the current Internet services, however, cannot support the live HD video transmissions because of their low uplink rate. In order to overcome this limit, we propose to offload the uplink transmissions to cooperative users via cognitive radio networks. Specifically, we first divide the video stream into several substreams according to the H.264/SVC standard and the cooperative users’ uplink rates. Then, the cooperative users are selected by employing our proposed optimal multiple stopping method. Finally, the substreams are assigned to the selected cooperative users by a 0-1 Knapsack-based allocation algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can successfully support 720P HD video chats.	smartphone	Tao Jing;Xuewei Cui;Wei Cheng;Shixiang Zhu;Yan Huo;Xiuzhen Cheng	2015	EURASIP J.

5f0ffe65ac638327757d8036fc44270d6eb09932	learning oriented cross-entropy approach to user association in load-balanced hetnet		This letter considers optimizing user association in a heterogeneous network via utility maximization, which is a combinatorial optimization problem due to integer constraints. Different from existing solutions based on convex optimization, we alternatively propose a cross-entropy (CE)-based algorithm inspired by a sampling approach developed in machine learning. Adopting a probabilistic model, we first reformulate the original problem as a CE minimization problem which aims to learn the probability distribution of variables in the optimal association. An efficient solution by stochastic sampling is introduced to solve the learning problem. The integer constraint is directly handled by the proposed algorithm, which is robust to network deployment and algorithm parameter choices. Simulations verify that the proposed CE approach achieves near-optimal performance quite efficiently.

The proposed scheme has iterative property and is carried out round-by-round. In each round, each secondary user selects a few primary channels as the candidates for sensing based on primary signal-to-noise ratio. Then, the users with the same selected channel collaboratively form coalitions through coalitional game and thereby multiple games are played concurrently over multiple channels. After generating stable coalitional structure, the best coalition on each channel is chosen to perform the cooperative spectrum sensing. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can significantly increase the number of available channels, which can be sensed with predefined miss detection and false alarm probabilities.	cognitive radio;game theory;iterative method;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Weiwei Wang;Behzad Kasiri;Jun Cai;Attahiru Sule Alfa	2010	2010 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference GLOBECOM 2010	10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5684337	game theory;cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	33.0886951799882	95.1802508963191	50584

In cognitive radio networks (CRNs), primary users (PUs) are allowed to lease out their unused spectrum to share with cognitive users (CUs). In a CRN consisting of multiple PUs and CUs, the spectrum pricing and resource allocation scheme have to be optimally designed, so that the efficient spectrum sharing among PUs and CUs can be supported and the QoS requirements of both PUs and CUs can be guaranteed. In this paper, we consider the joint spectrum pricing and resource allocation problem of a CRN with imperfect channel condition, i.e., channel state information of the PUs is not fully accessible to the CUs. To characterize the willingness of PUs to share subchannels and the intention of CU on accessing subchannels, a pricing scheme for both PUs and CUs is designed. Addressing the competition of CUs in channel accessing and power allocation, a non-cooperative Game model is formulated. Through solving the Nash equilibrium solution of the Game model, the optimal pricing and resource allocation strategy can be obtained. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.	algorithm;channel state information;cognitive radio;frequency allocation;game theory;nash equilibrium;numerical method;requirement;tip (unix utility)	Rong Chai;Li Zhou;Na Zhao;Xiaoya Lin	2014	9th International Conference on Communications and Networking in China	10.1109/CHINACOM.2014.7054358	pricing;games;benchmark;cognitive radio;simulation;computer science;resource management;computer network	Mobile	31.62762088873696	94.2878022193934	50863

Cooperative diversity is a technique where multiple users share their resources to realize a spatial diversity gain through cooperation. In this paper, the problem of downlink subcarrier allocation in a cooperative multiuser system is investigated. We assume a single-cell case where the base station has perfect knowledge of subchannel gains and all the mobile users are paired in cooperative groups. The mobile users in one cooperative group relay their partner data stream which is received from base station using a time division protocol. Based on the capacity contribution from the relaying terminal, a new parameter called cooperation coefficient is introduced. Considering the cooperation among users in assigning the subcarriers, a new subcarrier allocation algorithm is proposed. The performance of the proposed algorithm is then evaluated for different values of cooperation coefficients and is shown to maintain the same level of fairness but higher data rates compared with a similar algorithm which does not consider cooperation.	algorithm;coefficient;consensus dynamics;cooperative mimo;digital subchannel;fairness measure;multi-user;relay;simulation;subcarrier;telecommunications link	Hamed Rasouli;Sanam Sadr;Alagan Anpalagan	2008	IEEE GLOBECOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.788	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;cooperative diversity;computer network	Robotics	32.496483272392645	90.15890780056834	51092

And both secondary-to-primary and primary-to-secondary interference must be taken into consideration. To achieve these goals, we develop several joint distributed beamforming and power allocation algorithms. The development is based on the assumption of the availability of channel state information (CSI) of the relay-transceiver channels and the second-order-statistics (SOS) of all channels. For single-relay and multi-relay systems, a closed-form solution and an exhaustive-search optimal algorithm, respectively, are developed. This optimal algorithm, despite its high computational complexity, serves as a useful benchmark. Moreover, two low-complexity suboptimal algorithms are proposed, both of which compute sub-optimal power allocations and beamformers. A 10-dB SINR improvement by the optimal algorithm and similar gains by both proposed suboptimal algorithms are achievable.	algorithm;anisotropic filtering;beamforming;benchmark (computing);channel state information;computational complexity theory;interference (communication);memory management;optimization problem;relay;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;social inequality;transceiver	Chintha Tellambura	2014	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2014.2358953	telecommunications;relay channel;computer network	Mobile	35.57887254989609	89.95058544308706	51331

It can be done by carrying out negotiation among secondary users. However, significant overhead may be incurred by the negotiation since the negotiation needs to be done frequently due to the rapid change of primary users' activity. In this paper, a channel selection scheme without negotiation is considered for multi-user and multi-channel cognitive radio systems. To avoid collision incurred by non-coordination, each secondary user learns how to select channels according to its experience. Multi-agent reinforcement leaning (MARL) is applied in the framework of Q-learning by considering opponent secondary users as a part of the environment.

ecc23ff25d9e1ac16b67f71c0f64ff4c183c3b50	distributed online optimization of fog computing for selfish devices with out-of-date information		By performing fog computing, a device can offload delay-tolerant computationally demanding tasks to its peers for processing, and the results can be returned and aggregated. In distributed wireless networks, the challenges of fog computing include lack of central coordination, selfish behaviors of devices, and multi-hop signaling delays, which can result in outdated network knowledge and prevent effective cooperations beyond one hop. This paper presents a new approach to enable cooperations of  $N$  selfish devices over multiple hops, where selfish behaviors are discouraged by a tit-for-tat mechanism. The tit-for-tat incentive of a device is designed to be the gap between the helps (in terms of energy) the device has received and offered; and indicates how much help the device can offer at the next time slot. The tit-for-tat incentives can be evaluated at every device by having all devices broadcast how much help they offered in the past time slot, and used by all devices to schedule task offloading and processing. The approach achieves asymptotic optimality in a fully distributed fashion with a time-complexity of less than  $\mathcal {O}(N^{2})$ . The optimality loss resulting from multi-hop signaling delays and consequently outdated tit-for-tat incentives is proved to asymptotically diminish. Simulation results show that our approach substantially reduces the time-average energy consumption of the state of the art by 50% and accommodates more tasks, by engaging devices hops away under multi-hop delays.	asymptotically optimal algorithm;computer simulation;constant term;directed acyclic graph;drift plus penalty;emoticon;existential quantification;expanded memory;feasible region;fog computing;lyapunov fractal;lyapunov optimization;mathematical optimization;multidimensional digital pre-distortion;online and offline;online optimization;return of results;simulation;social inequality;software propagation;time complexity;xfig	Xinchen Lyu;Wei Ni;Hui Tian;Ren Ping Liu;Xin Wang;Georgios B.

51febd553a5471a816c6eed718d08683673359d3	target selection for tracking in multifunction radar networks: nash and correlated equilibria		We consider a target selection problem for multitarget tracking in a multifunction radar network from a game-theoretic perspective. The problem is formulated as a noncooperative game. The radars are considered to be players in this game with utilities modeled using a proper tracking accuracy criterion and their strategies are the observed targets whose number is known. Initially, for the problem of coordination, the Nash equilibria are characterized and, in order to find equilibria points, a distributed algorithm based on the best response dynamics is proposed. Afterward, the analysis is extended to the case of partial target observability and radar connectivity and heterogeneous interests among radars. The solution concept of correlated equilibria is employed and a distributed algorithm based on the regret matching is proposed. The proposed algorithms are shown to perform well compared to the centralized approach of significantly higher complexity.	centralized computing;distributed algorithm;game theory;multi-function printer;nash equilibrium;radar;regret (decision theory);selection algorithm	N M Seminina;Hans Driessen;Alexander G.

We formulate the problem as minimizing the total power consumed at the base station under constraints on the ergodic capacities from multiple users, the total number of subcarriers, and the number of radio frequency (RF) chains. A three-step searching algorithm is developed to solve this problem. We then analyze the impact of spatial-frequency resources, overall SE requirement and user fairness on the SE-EE relationship. Analytical and simulation results show that increasing frequency resource is more efficient than increasing spatial resource to improve the SE-EE relationship as a whole. The EE increases with the SE when the frequency resource is not constrained to the maximum value, otherwise a tradeoff between the SE and the EE exists. Sacrificing the fairness among users in terms of ergodic capacities can enhance the SE-EE relationship. In general, the adaptive configuration of spatial and frequency resources outperforms the adaptive configuration of only spatial or frequency resource.	ergodicity;fairness measure;frequency divider;java platform, enterprise edition;mimo;multi-user;radio frequency;search algorithm;simulation;spectral efficiency;subcarrier;telecommunications link	Zhikun Xu;Chenyang Yang;Geoffrey Ye Li;Shunqing Zhang;Yan Chen;Shugong Xu	2013	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2012.100512.110760	mathematical optimization;3g mimo;electronic engineering;real-time computing;multi-user mimo;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;mimo-ofdm;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics	HPC	29.263682847929154	90.68403540227688	51860

The performance results show that interesting synergic effects can be obtained in terms of user satisfaction probability by using both DCA and FH.

First, we derive in closed form the optimal pair of transmit power and receive filter for a fixed transmit filter by unifying the minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) filtering with the SISO-equivalent power allocation, as an iterative approach is not guaranteed to converge to global optimum. Second, we propose a heuristic algorithm to approximate the optimal transmit filter for a fixed receive filter. Furthermore, we study the well-known null-space projection constraint and derive a singular value decomposition (SVD)-based solution for the arbitrary-rank self-interference channel by generalizing the optimal solution under the assumption of rank-1 self-interference channel. Finally, we combine these solutions into a partially iterative algorithm in order to address the global optimization as our observations justify that some of the aforementioned schemes converge to the optimal solution under certain criteria. The numerical analysis of the proposed iterative algorithm demonstrates close-to-optimal performance relative to the theoretical upper bound of the end-to-end link in terms of maximum achievable throughput.	approximation algorithm;beamforming;channel state information;coherence (physics);converge;cooperative mimo;duplex (telecommunications);end-to-end principle;global optimization;heuristic (computer science);interference (communication);iterative method;kernel (linear algebra);many antennas;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;numerical method;operator overloading;relay;singular value decomposition;soft-in soft-out decoder;throughput;transmitter;whole earth 'lectronic link	Umut Ugurlu;Taneli Riihonen;Risto Wichman	2016	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2015.2396684	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;numerical analysis;computer science;control theory;mathematics;decomposition;beamforming	Metrics	38.060441230823265	89.8966629794831	52133
f86e12b017278ac4e479cbce87ce85fe2d464bc8	optimal beamforming and power splitting design for swipt under non-linear energy harvesting model		This paper investigates the joint optimal beamforming and power-splitting receiver architecture design for simultaneous information and power transfer (SWIPT) under non-linear energy harvesting (EH) circuit environment, where hybrid access point (H-AP) equipped with multiple antennas simultaneously transmits information and power to multiple single-antenna users. For such a system, in order to achieve green communication design, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the total transmit power of H-AP subjecting to the required signal-to-interference-plus- noise ratio (SINR) and the harvested power constrains at each user under non-linear EH model. Since the problem is non-convex, the relaxed semidefinite program (SDP) is used to solve it, and it is proved that the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) process is tight and our optimal solution achieves the global optimum. Numerical results show that a considerable gain could be achieved if the SWIPT beamforming vector and the power splitting ratios are jointly designed under the non-linear EH model compared with traditional linear EH model, since the non-linear EH model captures and matches the real EH circuits' non-linear features. Moreover, the feasible region of traditional linear EH model in the non-linear EH circuit environment is also characterized.	beamforming;etsi satellite digital radio;exponential hierarchy;feasible region;global optimization;interference (communication);linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;multi-user;nonlinear system;numerical method;optimization problem;relaxation (approximation);semidefinite programming;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;wireless access point	Ruihong Jiang;Ke Xiong;Pingyi Fan;Shaohong Zhong;Zhangdui Zhong	2017	GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254849	real-time computing;transmitter power output;electronic circuit;energy harvesting;control theory;feasible region;beamforming;computer science;optimization problem;maximum power transfer theorem;signal-to-noise ratio	EDA	37.848036107299	90.36489218185226	52160
b8b6fb9c09af05e3b7b9a1d172bddd07ff2a04d3	uav-enabled multiuser wireless power transfer: trajectory design and energy optimization		This paper investigates an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled multiuser wireless power transfer (WPT) system, where a UAV-mounted energy transmitter (ET) is dispatched to broadcast wireless energy to charge multiple energy receivers (ERs) on the ground. To ensure efficient and fair WPT, we maximize the minimum of the energy harvested by all ERs during a given charging period, by optimizing the UAVu0027s trajectory subject to its maximum speed constraints. Such a min-energy maximization problem, however, is non-convex, and thus is challenging to be directly solved. To tackle this problem, we first consider an ideal case by ignoring the UAVu0027s maximum speed constraint, and show that the relaxed problem can be optimally solved via the Lagrange dual method. The obtained trajectory solution implies that the UAV should hover over a set of fixed locations with optimal allocation of the hovering time among them. Then, for the general case with the UAVu0027s maximum speed constraint considered, we propose a new successive hover-and-fly trajectory motivated by the optimal trajectory in the ideal case, and obtain efficient trajectory designs by applying the successive convex programing (SCP) optimization technique. Numerical results show that our proposed trajectory designs significantly improve the min-energy transferred to all ERs, as compared to other benchmark schemes.	aerial photography;benchmark (computing);convex function;duality (optimization);entropy maximization;expectation–maximization algorithm;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;multi-user;numerical method;transmitter;unmanned aerial vehicle	Jie Xu;Yong Zeng;Rui Zhang	2017	2017 23rd Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC)	10.23919/APCC.2017.8304077	computer science;real-time computing;transmitter;mathematical optimization;wireless;trajectory;energy minimization;wireless power transfer;broadcasting;maximization	EDA	35.02905299148404	92.57992685187757	52590

In particular, we propose a distributed algorithm that matches each source-destination pair with a particular jammer. Our algorithm caters for three channel state information (CSI) assumptions: global CSI, local CSI, and local CSI without the eavesdropper channel. We prove that our algorithm has many desirable properties. First, the outcome of the proposed algorithm results in a stable matching, which is important if the source and jamming nodes are selfish. Second, the secrecy rate of the proposed algorithm converges to the secrecy rate of a centralized optimal solution, if the price step-number is sufficiently small. Third, our algorithm converges only after a small number of iterations, and its overhead is relatively small. Fourth, our algorithm has a significantly lower complexity than a centralized optimal approach.	centralized computing;channel state information;complexity;distributed algorithm;iteration;overhead (computing);radio jamming;stable marriage problem	Siavash Bayat;Raymond H.

3eca483e3fe632fd4872bca8118fc6ba8a3e1e45	robust cooperative spectrum sensing based on adaptive reputation and evidential reasoning theory in cognitive radio network		In this paper we investigate the problem of cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) in cognitive radio networks (CRNs) in the presence of malicious attacks from secondary users (SUs). We propose a novel CSS approach based on a new adaptive reputation and evidential reasoning theory (ERT) to detect the malicious SUs, to strengthen the sensing ability, and to keep good stability and generalization ability. Different from the previous work, we assume that the fusion center has no prior information of the radios in CRNs except the condition that the honest SUs are in majority. Specifically, to counter different attack strategies, we present an adaptive reputation which fully considers the signal-to-noise ratio, historical sensing data information, and current local sensing results via an energy detection method. The proposed adaptive reputation can effectively identify the malicious SUs when the CRNs are with single-attack or multiple-attack models. Furthermore, we present a CSS scheme via the proposed adaptive reputation and ERT on the basis of local sensing results derived from the energy detection method. The new CSS scheme has good robustness and generality and can decrease the computational complexity and overcome the evidence conflict problems of Dempster–Shafer theory-based CSS schemes. Extensive simulations are carried out to demonstrate the performance and the superiority of the proposed approach in contrast with previous methods.	cognitive radio	Jingping Wang;Qing Guo;Wei Xing Zheng;Qihui Wu	2018	CSSP	10.1007/s00034-018-0774-z	mathematical optimization;robustness (computer science);mathematics;computational complexity theory;cognitive radio;generality;machine learning;evidential reasoning approach;artificial intelligence;reputation	AI	47.90100321399497	88.77684975889437	52793

Assuming that perfect channel-state information (CSI) for all channels is not available at the BS, the uncertainty of the CSI is modeled by an Euclidean ball-shaped uncertainty set. To optimally design transmit beamforming weights and receive power splitting, an average total transmit power minimization problem is investigated subject to the individual harvested power constraint and the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio constraint at each user. Due to the channel uncertainty, the original problem becomes a homogeneous quadratically constrained quadratic problem, which is NP-hard. The original design problem is reformulated to a relaxed semidefinite program, and then two different approaches based on convex programming are proposed, which can be solved efficiently by the interior point algorithm. Numerical results are provided to validate the robustness of the proposed algorithms.	algorithm;beamforming;channel state information;convex optimization;interference (communication);interior point method;mathematical optimization;multi-user;np-hardness;numerical method;optimization problem;quadratic equation;robust optimization;semidefinite programming;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;system analysis;transceiver	Zhongyong Wang;Kyoung-Jae Lee;Zheng Chu;Inkyu Lee	2016	Journal of Communications and Networks	10.1109/JCN.2016.000026	mathematical optimization;telecommunications;energy harvesting	Mobile	37.27126387913822	90.07074154194596	52834
4dbba97dddf5243a8fbe993e6e42a69f185923f7	interference-aware spectrum handover for cognitive radio networks	interference temperature;spectrum handover;power control	Cognitive radio (CR) is a promising technique for future wireless networks, which significantly improves spectrum utilization. In CR networks, when the primary users (PUs) appear, the secondary users (SUs) have to switch to other available channels to avoid the interference to PUs. However, in the multi-SU scenario, it is still a challenging problem to make an optimal decision on spectrum handover because of the the accumulated interference constraint of PUs and SUs. In this paper, we propose an interference-aware spectrum handover scheme that aims to maximize the CR network capacity and minimize the spectrum handover overhead by coordinating SUs’ handover decision optimally in the PU–SU coexisted CR networks. On the basis of the interference temperature model, the spectrum handover problem is formulated as a constrained optimization problem, which is in general a non-deterministic polynomial-time hard problem. To address the problem in a feasible way, we design a heuristic algorithm by using the technique of Branch and Bound. Finally, we combine our spectrum handover scheme with power control and give a convenient solution in a single-SU scenario. Experimental results show that our algorithm can improve the network performance efficiently.

In this paper, cognitive radios have been employed to obtain more spectrum by utilizing unused licensed spectrum in an opportunistic manner. Defining the opportunity cost as the consumed energy per achieved unit of free spectrum, we propose a cooperative sensing scheduling framework to optimize the cost with the consideration of the sensing, reporting and channel switching costs in terms of energy expenditure subject to a licensed user protection threshold. In the proposed scheme, all primary channels are scheduled to be cooperatively sensed within a cycle which consists of rounds. In every round, secondary/unlicensed users (SUs) are first assigned to cooperatively sense the scheduled primary/licensed user (PU) channels. Consequently, SUs report their local sensing results to a fusion center for a global decision. Finally, SUs assigned to sense other PU channels perform channel switching for the next round. This scheme not only provides a feasible network set up in case there does not exist a sufficient number of SUs to satisfy the PU protection in a single round, but also offers an apparent reduction in the opportunity cost.	cognitive radio;ibm systems network architecture;scheduling (computing)	Abdulkadir Celik;Ahmed E.

Joint processing (JP) in CoMP technology provides multiple data transmission points for each user among multiple cooperated radio base stations. Handover is one of the key components in cellular network mobility management. A handover algorithm is needed for making a handover decision. In this paper, a capacity integrated CoMP handover algorithm supporting JP in LTE-A system is proposed. Capacity integrated CoMP handover algorithm aims to ensure the radio resources are efficiently used in the system in both capacity and channel quality domains while reducing unnecessary feedbacks. Simulation results show that capacity integrated CoMP handover algorithm not only can improve the system throughput but also minimize the system delay, packet loss, and less total number of handovers than open literature CoMP handover algorithm.	algorithm;compaq lte;digi-comp i;entity–relationship model;multipoint ground;network packet;proxy mobile ipv6;public lending right;simulation;throughput	Cheng-Chung Lin;Kumbesan Sandrasegaran;Xinning Zhu;Zhuliang Xu	2012	2012 18th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC)	10.1109/APCC.2012.6388207	real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering;soft handover;computer network	Mobile	26.068305838784617	90.10764675984478	53256

But such a dynamic spectrum access strategy requires an effective method for estimating the impact of the LTA-Advanced RAN operation on the primary user and minimizing it. LTE-Advanced provides a useful feature, namely the minimization of drive test (MDT) reporting system, wherein the network collects measurement data performed by the user equipment. Each report provides position and signal strength information. In this paper, we compare the performance of some spatial interpolation methods that would be used to reconstruct the interference map of an LTE-Advanced RAN based on the MDT reports. In this way, the MNO can determine if an LSA channel could be used without potential harm to the primary user operation just by checking the estimated interference map. Furthermore, the performance of different interpolation methods for establishment of interference map is analyzed, when the MDT reports containing errors in the values or locations of the reported measurements. Estimation accuracy is also evaluated respect to spatial correlation.	catastrophic interference;cognitive radio;compaq lte;effective method;elegant degradation;interference (communication);investigative data warehouse;kriging;multivariate interpolation;radio access network;statistical interference;utility functions on indivisible goods	Juan Diego Naranjo;Azad Ravanshid;Ingo Viering;Rüdiger Halfmann;Gerhard Bauch	2014	2014 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2014.6952411	cognitive radio;telecommunications;radio resource management;remote radio head;computer network	Mobile	26.466178115698657	89.59108877071968	53730
9c69bf8e7583087ca56a1329c135c83e1471c4b8	availability-aware cell association for hybrid power supply networks with adaptive bias		New challenges have emerged from the integration of renewable energy sources within the conventional electrical grid which powers base stations (BS). Energy-aware traffic offloading brings a promising solution to maintain the user performance while reducing the carbon footprint. Focusing on downlink cellular networks consisting of on-grid, off-grid and hybrid BSs, we propose a novel poweraware biased cell association where each user independently partitions BSs into two sets and applies different association biases for each, depending on the type of power, renewable or not, that can be requested for service. The gain provided by such strategy regarding the probability of power outage and the average grid power consumption is investigated. To capture their dual nature, the bias applied for association with a hybrid BS is not constant among users nor over time, and is dynamically tailored to the fluctuations of the BS battery level, the user power requirement and the estimated power consumed to serve other users potentially associated with the same BS. Such approach allows to efficiently share the available energy among BSs and turns high heterogeneity in the BS powering into advantage.	algorithm;downtime;exptime;integrated circuit layout design protection;power supply;rechargeable battery;recursion;stochastic matrix;telecommunications link	Fanny Parzysz;Christos V.

d3e9bb2f8cabe92c1e41a4c9732fab1068956fcb	efficient joint power and admission control in underlay cognitive networks using benders' decomposition method		Abstract In this paper, the joint power and admission control (JPAC) problem in cognitive radio networks is studied. This problem is decomposed into two subproblems, by utilizing the Benders’ decomposition theory, which are efficiently addressed. Specifically, the former is a simple linear optimization problem which a closed-form expression for its optimal solution is derived, and the latter is solved via an iterative distributed power control algorithm. Furthermore, we use the outcomes of the decomposed two subproblems to propose a sequential searching JPAC algorithm with a novel removal metric whereas minimal number of SUs are sequentially removed. In an infeasible system, where the minimum target signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratios (SINRs) of all primary and secondary users are not simultaneously reachable, our proposed JPAC algorithm guarantees protecting all primary users while the maximal number of SUs are admitted and supported with their target SINRs. Not only our proposed algorithm does converge to an equilibrium, but also outperforms existing algorithms in terms of average outage ratio and average aggregate power, as demonstrated through the extensive simulations.	benders decomposition;cognitive network	Fahime Khoramnejad;Mehdi Rasti;Hossein Pedram;Mehdi Monemi	2018	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2018.07.018	computer science;mathematical optimization;real-time computing;distributed power;cognitive radio;admission control;linear programming;benders' decomposition;cognitive network	Robotics	33.810820099352206	92.23105880717749	53839
13c7ffb1809d1e4ebb9858c2aaba0f51099abf0f	energy-efficient radio remote units placement for single-user uplink in c-ran	energy efficient;rrus placement;c ran	SUMMARY#R##N##R##N#Because of the increasing energy consumption in radio access networks, a new radio access network called Cloud radio access network (C-RAN) has attracted increasing attention. In C-RAN, the distributed radio remote units (RRUs) are located in different sites and the placement of RRUs will influence the system performance. However, few researches investigate the optimal RRU placement from the perspective of energy efficiency, which is one of the most important characteristics of C-RAN. In this paper, we first derive the energy efficiency of C-RAN to achieve certain QoS requirements considering the circuitry energy consumption. Then, we obtain the optimal placement of RRUs by minimizing the consumed energy per bit. Numerical results are also presented to validate the analysis.

12d57bbb30724111bbac40cc67d8818fca1e32d4	energy efficient beamforming design for full-duplex mimo interference channels		We consider the beamforming design to maximize the energy-efficiency (EE) of a K link multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) interference channel, where each link consists of two full-duplex (FD) nodes. We first transform the original fractional form optimization problem into an equivalent subtractive-form optimization problem by exploiting the properties of fractional programming, and then perform a two-layer optimization scheme. In the outer layer, the EE parameter is searched using a simple one-dimensional search, and in the inner layer, the relationship between Weighted-Sum-Rate (WSR) and Weighted Minimum-Mean-Squared-Error (WMMSE) problems is exploited to solve the subtractive form optimization problem. Simulation results show that the EE of FD systems is lower than that of half-duplex (HD) systems, as FD nodes need to overcome self-interference (SI) which leads to high power consumption.	algorithm;beamforming;duplex (telecommunications);fractional programming;interference (communication);iterative method;mimo;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;numerical analysis;optimization problem;simulation;stationary process;transmitter;waist-to-height ratio	Ali Cagatay Cirik;Sudip Biswas;Satyanarayana Vuppala;Tharmalingam Ratnarajah	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2017.7996750	mimo;duplex (telecommunications);computer science;efficient energy use;mathematical optimization;fractional programming;interference (wave propagation);beamforming;optimization problem;communication channel	Robotics	36.90694746451672	90.02069034139132	54025
324ef5627fc65e8f546efe24754f0ddef567ea4a	dc programming and dca for enhancing physical layer security via cooperative jamming		Abstract The explosive development of computational tools these days is threatening security of cryptographic algorithms, which are regarded as primary traditional methods for ensuring information security. The physical layer security approach is introduced as a method for both improving confidentiality of the secret key distribution in cryptography and enabling the data transmission without relaying on higher-layer encryption. In this paper, the cooperative jamming paradigm - one of the techniques used in the physical layer is studied and the resulting power allocation problem with the aim of maximizing the sum of secrecy rates subject to power constraints is formulated as a nonconvex optimization problem. The objective function is a so-called DC (Difference of Convex functions) function, and some constraints are coupling. We propose a new DC formulation and develop an efficient DCA (DC Algorithm) to deal with this nonconvex program. The DCA introduces the elegant concept of approximating the original nonconvex program by a sequence of convex ones: at each iteration of DCA requires solution of a convex subproblem. The main advantage of the proposed approach is that it leads to strongly convex quadratic subproblems with separate variables in the objective function, which can be tackled by both distributed and centralized methods. One of the major contributions of the paper is to develop a highly efficient distributed algorithm to solve the convex subproblem. We adopt the dual decomposition method that results in computing iteratively the projection of points onto a very simple structural set which can be determined by an inexpensive procedure. The numerical results show the efficiency and the superiority of the new DCA based algorithm compared with existing approaches.	algorithm;centralized computing;confidentiality;convex function;cooperative mimo;cryptography;download;encryption;information security;key (cryptography);key distribution;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimization problem;programming paradigm;radio jamming;signal processing;time complexity	Tran Thi Thuy;Le Thi Hoai An;Tao Pham Dinh	2017	Computers & OR	10.1016/j.cor.2016.11.003	mathematical optimization;key distribution;decomposition method (constraint satisfaction);encryption;distributed algorithm;physical layer;theoretical computer science;cryptography;convex function;optimization problem;computer science	AI	37.66104824377095	90.97426779418929	54103
168047435fc5c047e0725094847350ba37acf7ba	throughput maximization for laser-powered uav wireless communication systems		Laser power has become a viable solution to provide convenient and sustainable energy supply to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In this paper, we study a laser-powered UAV wireless communication system, where a laser transmitter sends laser beams to charge a fixed-wing UAV in flight, and the UAV uses the harvested laser energy to communicate with a ground station. To maintain the UAV's sustainable operation, its total energy consumption cannot exceed that harvested from the laser transmitter. Under such a laser energy harvesting constraint, we maximize the downlink communication throughput from the UAV to the ground station over a finite time duration, by jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory and its transmit power allocation. However, due to the complicated UAV energy consumption model, this problem is non-convex and difficult to be solved. To tackle the problem, we first consider a special case with a double-circular UAV trajectory which balances the tradeoff between maximizing the performance of laser energy harvesting versus wireless communication at the UAV. Next, based on the obtained double-circular trajectory, we propose an efficient solution to the general problem, by applying the techniques of alternating optimization and sequential convex programming (SCP). Finally, numerical results are provided to validate the communication throughput performance of the proposed design.	aerial photography;convex function;convex optimization;expectation–maximization algorithm;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;telecommunications link;throughput;transmitter;unmanned aerial vehicle	Jie Ouyang;Yueling Che;Jie Xu;Kaishun Wu	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC Workshops)	10.1109/ICCW.2018.8403572	throughput;real-time computing;transmitter power output;laser power scaling;energy harvesting;wireless;energy consumption;computer science;transmitter;convex optimization	Robotics	34.997654211451206	92.6289332341179	54315
78c4aa50a688ca4c4f19a5a900a547413c90563d	transceiver design for mimo vlc systems with integer-forcing receivers		In this paper, we investigate the transceiver design for multiple-input multiple-output visible light communication (VLC) systems that employ the integer-forcing (IF) lattice decoding technique. To facilitate the joint design of the transmitter precoder, the integer matrix and the receiver equalizer, we first give a necessary and sufficient condition for the integer matrix to be invertible over 1-D lattice. Based on this condition, we then propose a new method for choosing the integer matrix which achieves better performance than the existing lattice reduction method. Moreover, taking into account two typical constraints in VLC, we optimize transmit and receive matrices using the conditional gradient method or the projected gradient method. Finally, the integer matrix and the transmit and receive matrices are jointly optimized in an iterative manner. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance improvement achieved by the proposed framework.	equalization (communications);frank–wolfe algorithm;gradient method;hp 48 series;ibm notes;iterative method;lattice reduction;mimo;negativity (quantum mechanics);newton's method;simulation;transceiver;transmitter;vlc media player	Nuo Huang;Xiaodong Wang;Ming Chen	2018	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2017.2774458	integer matrix;3g mimo;invertible matrix;mathematical optimization;computer science;mimo;real-time computing;gradient method;matrix (mathematics);decoding methods;lattice reduction	Vision	39.574786106109606	89.5422260552439	54384

They propose a novel approach in a new perspective: namely, user navigation, to improve the CA performance of an LTE-A system in the indoor environment. The proposed indoor user navigation (IUN) algorithm exploits the a priori knowledge of radio interferences between femtocells to build a geometric quality-of-service (QoS) map, which can be utilised to navigate users toward the locations suitable for performing CA to satisfy the QoS requirements. The simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed IUN algorithm to improve the CA performance in terms of the aggregate throughput for the LTE-A femtocell networks.	compaq lte	Chiapin Wang;Shih-Hau Fang;Wen-Hsing Kuo;Hsiao-Chun Wu	2017	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2016.0082	simulation;calcium;telecommunications;computer network	Robotics	26.12364812274752	90.60662697605358	54454

Finally, we propose a two-step optimization procedure for optimizing the feedback algorithm for real-life cellular standards.	algorithm;feedback;mathematical optimization;polling (computer science);real life;scheduling (computing);transmitter	Vegard Hassel;David Gesbert;Mohamed-Slim Alouini;Geir E.

4dec439ebcdd8d75bfc9a91d3bd3f27cdf80ca9c	distributed mimo precoding for in-band full-duplex wireless backhaul in heterogeneous networks		This paper investigates distributed MIMO precoding design to maximize the weighted sum rate in a heterogeneous network where the multiple input multiple output full-duplex (MIMO-FD) small cells reuse the downlink spectrum of the macro base-station (BS) to exchange backhaul information. The multi-antenna BS transmits signals to the cellular users using the dirty paper coding technique and the MIMO-FD small cells apply FD precoding structures to effectively balance the received signal, the self-interference (SI), and the co-channel interference (CCI). Since the optimization problem is shown to be nonconvex, obtaining the global optimum is challenging. A low-complexity solution with distributed implementation is introduced with proved convergence. By applying the successive convex approximation technique and the duality between the broadcast channel and the multiple access channel, the original nonconvex problem is decomposed into a sequence of convex subproblems, which can be solved analytically and separately at each small cell and macro BS with limited channel state information exchange. Simulation results confirm the convergence and demonstrate the benefits of the introduced algorithm. It is shown that the SI and CCI can be suppressed effectively with sufficient cancellation power and number of transmit antennas at the FD small cells.	algorithm;approximation;backhaul (telecommunications);channel state information;duplex (telecommunications);global optimization;information exchange;interference (communication);mimo;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;simulation;telecommunications link;vergence;weight function	Yi Ci Li;Peng Fan;Lingjia Liu;Yang Yi	2018	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2017.2713413	electronic engineering;mimo;duplex (telecommunications);channel state information;computer science;telecommunications link;precoding;dirty paper coding;backhaul (telecommunications);zero-forcing precoding	Mobile	36.81555620442186	89.79039085682747	55782

We used a Gram matrix approach for robust determination of sensor locations by minimizing the interferences (maximizing the signal strength) among sensors for engine health monitoring systems. In order to solve the problem of optimum placement, an iterative algorithm for maximizing the determinant of the Gram matrix is proposed and implemented. The sensitivity criterion proposed in this paper is the spectral number of the Frobenius norm of the Gram matrix associated with sensor readings. We derived the necessary conditions under which the number of sensors and the optimal sensor locations will remain unchanged when the data measured for sensitivity analysis is affected by AWGN. Our theoretical results are verified by simulations providing details concerning numerical implementations.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;catastrophic interference;colors of noise;global optimization;gramian matrix;interference (communication);iterative method;mathematical optimization;matrix multiplication;numerical analysis;numerical method;optimization problem;robustness (computer science);sensor;simulation;statistical interference;utility functions on indivisible goods	Paul Cotae;Sireesha Yalamanchili;C.

However, challenges arise in the femtocell planning and management, particularly due to interference occuring when femtocells are deployed in a co-channel with the macrocell. The cognitive radio inspired femtocell is one of the solutions to mitigate interference. In this study, the cognitive scheme is enhanced by enabling the femtocell to take advantage of LTE channel-dependent scheduling in order to predict the future resources of nearby victim macro- users and avoid using them. Simulation results show that the co-channel interference on the macrocell downlink signal is minimal, and therefore performance is improved under the condition that the cognitive femtocell operates adaptively and monitors spectrum allocations continuously.	cognitive radio;compaq lte;interference (communication);low-power broadcasting;scheduling (computing);simulation;software deployment;telecommunications link	Sinan A.

BitC allows BSNs to adapt their configurations (sensing intervals and sampling dates as well as data transmission intervals) to operational conditions (e.g., data request patterns) with respect to multiple conflicting performance objectives such as resource consumption and data yield. BitC theoretically guarantees that each BSN performs an evolutionarily stable configuration strategy, which is an equilibrium solution under given operational conditions. Simulation results verify this theoretical analysis; BSNs seek equilibria to perform adaptive and evolutionarily stable configuration strategies.

The goal of the BSs is to improve cell-edge performance by selecting the subset of ports that maximizes the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio of the user terminals in a coordinated manner. This problem is cast as a binary-constrained optimization problem, which is known to be NP-hard. To circumvent this difficulty, the semidefinite relaxation technique is used to efficiently generate Gaussian distributed vectors. Simulation results show that rounding a relatively small number of these vectors yields close-to-optimal solutions of the original problem.	constrained optimization;constraint (mathematics);etsi satellite digital radio;gaussian blur;interference (communication);linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;max-min fairness;multistage interconnection networks;np-hardness;optimization problem;polynomial;relaxation (approximation);rounding;semidefinite programming;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;telecommunications link	Talha Ahmad;Ramy H.

Conventionally, dynamic spectrum access is conducted through (double) spectrum auction, where a third-party auctioneer collects bids from buyers and sellers, and determines the spectrum allocation. Rather than placing bids only on individual channels, combinatorial spectrum auction allows buyers to express their valuations for different combinations of channels. However, auction mechanisms are generally vulnerable to the collusion between the auctioneer and buyers or sellers. Furthermore, to find the optimal allocation in combinatorial auction is usually NP-hard. In this paper, we propose to leverage a many-to-many matching framework to realize combinatorial spectrum trading. Unlike traditional many-to-many matching problem, spectrum matching is more challenging, because spectrum allocation is interference-limited rather than quota-limited. To deal with this problem, we propose a novel matching algorithm, which takes buyers' interference relationship into consideration. We theoretically prove that the matching result is individual rational, strong pairwise stable and is a subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium of the corresponding spectrum bargaining game. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can converge to a stable matching within a few iterations.	algorithm;catastrophic interference;converge;crowdsourcing;frequency allocation;interference (communication);iteration;machine to machine;many-to-many;matching (graph theory);mathematical optimization;np-hardness;nash equilibrium;simulation;stable marriage problem;walrasian auction	Linshan Jiang;Haofan Cai;Yanjiao Chen;Jin Zhang;Baochun Li	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2016.7511434	von neumann stability analysis;combinatorial auction;computer science;resource management;interference;mathematical economics;wireless;cost accounting;bandwidth allocation	Mobile	32.24630635193613	93.68375515857504	56221

However, mobile devices are provided with small batteries that can be drained quickly by high data rate transmission. Motivated by the fundamental requirement of extending the battery utilization time per charge of mobile devices, this work presents two power-efficient schedulers for mixed streaming services in LTE uplink systems. Our objective is to minimize the total transmission power for all users. The proposed schedulers are subject to rate, delay, contiguous allocation, and maximum transmission power constraints. We first consider an optimal scheduler that uses binary integer programming (BIP). Then, we propose an iterative scheduler that performs a low-complexity greedy algorithm which solves the BIP problem. We compare the performance of the proposed schedulers to the state-of-the-art schedulers such as the energy-aware resource allocation (EARA) [1] and the proportional fair (PF) [2] in terms of rate, delay, average transmission power and complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed schedulers offer a remarkable transmission power reduction as compared to the PF and the EARA schedulers, and satisfy the QoS requirements.	compaq lte;computational complexity theory;data rate units;greedy algorithm;integer programming;iterative method;linear programming;mobile device;performance per watt;proportionally fair;quality of service;requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation;telecommunications link;transmitter;uncompressed video	Mohamad Kalil;Abdallah Shami;Arafat J.

This paper proposes two cross-provider localization algorithms via a cooperative approach, which are called linear regression (LR) and locally cooperative embedding (LCE), to efficiently exploit the complementary information from each network provider. The former chooses the provider weights that minimize the mean-square positioning errors. The latter dynamically embeds the cooperation and iteratively refines the positioning process according to each provider's local accuracy surrounding the user. This paper applies the proposed cross-provider positioning algorithms to actual Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) networks, using a dual-subscriber-identity-module (SIM) mobile phone connecting to multiple providers simultaneously. On-site experiments clearly demonstrated that the proposed cross-provider approaches provide better positioning accuracy than any individual provider, where LCE achieves the best performance.	algorithm;experiment;lr parser;mobile phone;subscriber identity module	Shih-Hau Fang	2013	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2012.2217161	embedded system;mobile identification number;subscriber identity module;telecommunications;gsm services;engineering;mobile phone signal;mobile phone tracking;mathematics;iterative method;mobile station;timing advance;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	36.893785522562375	97.21477108018252	56487

A reservation-based medium access control protocol is assumed where the base station (BS) allocates transmission slots to the system mobile stations based on their requests. Each station is assumed to have a tunable transmitter and tunable receiver. For this network architecture, the scheduling algorithms can be classified into two categories: contiguous and non-contiguous, depending on whether slots are allocated contiguously to the mobile stations. The main objective of the scheduling algorithms is to achieve high channel utility while having low time complexity. In this paper, we propose three scheduling algorithms termed contiguous sorted sequential allocation (CSSA), non-contiguous round robin allocation (NCRRA) and non-contiguous sorted round robin allocation (NCSRRA). Among these, CSSA schedules each station in contiguous mode, while other two algorithms, NCRRA and NCSRRA, schedule stations in non-contiguous mode. Through extensive analysis and simulation, the results demonstrate that the CSSA with only slightly increased complexity can achieve much higher channel utility when compared to the existing contiguous scheduling algorithms. The NCRRA and NCSRRA on the other hand, results in significantly lower complexity, while still achieving the optimal channel utility compared to existing non-contiguous scheduling algorithms.	scheduling (computing)	Chonggang Wang;Bo Li;Krishna M.

At different levels of wireless channel knowledge, the problem of interest is beamforming to optimize the users’ quality-of-service (QoS) in terms of their secrecy throughputs or maximize the network’s energy efficiency under users’ QoS. All these problems are seen as very difficult optimization problems with many nonconvex constraints and nonlinear equality constraints in beamforming vectors. The paper develops path-following computational procedures of low-complexity and rapid convergence for the optimal beamforming solution. Their practicability is demonstrated through numerical examples.		Zhichao Sheng;Hoang Duong Tuan;Trung Quang Duong;H.

5a24196bf3b1b76702009f4ce0d6f9b6ac5c5b2c	optimal resource allocation for non-real time visible light communication networks		In this paper, we consider the optimal joint resource alloca- tion problem of subcarrier and power for non-real time wireless networks that use visible light communication (VLC) technology. VLC has been recognized as a promising technology as it allows to transmit data in considerably higher orders of magnitude compared to traditional radio frequency (RF) methods (3). Therefore, it is expected that most of the current existing protocols for resource allocation using traditional RF technologies will adapt to VLC technology in the near future. We model the resource allocation problem by means of a mixed integer nonlinear optimization problem that we further linearize using a piecewise linear approximation method. The latter allows to compute optimal and near optimal solutions for the problem. Optimal solutions can be obtained as long as the number of line segments is sufficiently large. Subsequently, we propose a variable neighborhood search based decomposition proce- dure that allows to compute, in average, tight near optimal solutions in less than one second compared to the high CPU time required by the piecewise linear model.	telecommunications network	Fabián Seguel;Pablo Adasme;Ismael Soto;Belarmino Nuñez	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-44215-0_16	mathematical optimization;real-time computing;simulation;mathematics	Theory	26.28527561202711	99.25390740796244	56842

To comply with the decentralized wireless networks' architecture, we propose to decompose the MUMDP into multiple local MDPs using Lagrangian relaxation. Unlike in conventional multi-user video transmission solutions stemming from the network utility maximization framework, the proposed decomposition enables each wireless user to individually solve its own local MDP (i.e. dynamic single-user cross-layer optimization) and the network coordinator to update the Lagrangian multipliers (i.e. resource prices) based on not only current, but also the future resource needs of all users, such that the long-term video quality of all users is maximized. This MUMDP solution provides us the necessary foundations and structures for solving multiuser video communication problems. However, to implement this framework in practice requires statistical knowledge of the experienced environment dynamics, which is often unavailable before transmission time. To overcome this obstacle, we propose a novel online learning algorithm, which allows the wireless users to simultaneously update their policies at multiple states during each time slot. This is different from conventional learning solutions, which often update the current visited state per time slot. The proposed learning algorithm can significantly improve the learning performance, thereby dramatically improving the video quality experienced by the wireless users over time. Our simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed MUMDP framework as compared to conventional multi-user video transmission solutions.	augmented lagrangian method;backward induction;bellman equation;computation;concave function;convex function;convex optimization;duality gap;dynamic programming;emoticon;expanded memory;expectation–maximization algorithm;lagrange multiplier;lagrangian relaxation;linear programming relaxation;mud;marginal model;markov chain;markov decision process;mathematical induction;mathematical optimization;multi-user;network packet;network utility;optimization problem;recursion;reinforcement learning;sample rate conversion;scheduling (computing);semiconductor research corporation;simulation;sketch;social inequality;state transition table;stemming;stochastic matrix;subgradient method;time-varying network	Fangwen Fu;Mihaela van der Schaar	2010	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2010.100403	real-time computing;simulation;resource allocation;computer science;resource management;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	25.27564063234854	96.76074596715411	57492

However, a non-optimized deployment of these APs can reduce the network performance significantly due to the excessive interference. The optimization of the channel and transmit power is an efficient method to reduce the interference and therefore guarantee a minimally acceptable performance. In this paper, we propose a heuristic algorithm to find a proper channel and transmit power configuration for all APs within a network. The algorithm evaluates the network, using theoretical models, and employs several techniques to optimize the channel and the transmit power to increase the network performance. We also estimate the complexity of the proposed algorithm comparing it with an exhaustive search approach. The results show that the proposed algorithm can arrive at a solution very close to the optimal with a much reduced computational complexity.	heuristic;iterative method	Giovanna G.

Scalable transmission enables dynamic adaption of source information to the condition of user equipment (UE) devices and, thus, is suitable for cellular networks in which the transmission link quality substantially varies over space and time. Two novel transmission schemes are proposed, namely, layered digital transmission and layered hybrid digital–analog (LHDA) transmission. Leveraging tools from stochastic geometry, a comprehensive analysis is conducted focusing on three key performance metrics: outage probability, high-definition probability, and average distortion. The results show that both proposed transmission schemes can provide a scalable video experience for UE devices. For LHDA transmission, the optimal power allocation between digital and analog transmissions is also analyzed. When the proportion of frequency resource allocated to the femtotier exceeds a certain threshold, LHDA transmission is preferable by enabling continuous quality scalability, thus avoiding the cliff effect.	cliff effect;data compression;distortion;downtime;hd radio;hdmi;scalability;scalable video coding	Liang Wu;Yi Zhong;Wenyi Zhang;Martin Haenggi	2017	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2016.2569088	transmission;electronic engineering;real-time computing;scalability;frequency allocation;mobile telephony;distortion;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;computer network	Mobile	25.061674131188298	90.32068984675536	57632

A potential solution to increase the network capacity while saving energy is to offload part of the traffic through femtocells. In this paper, we propose a reverse auction based on Vickrey-Clarke-Grove (VCG) mechanism in the heterogeneous network, which incentives femtocell owners to rent their under-utilized spectrum for the offloading purpose. The auction allows the mobile network operator to explicitly mark their personal preferences towards different femtocells, and also take the location availability into consideration. Further, we address a greedy algorithm to avoid the high time complexity problem of VCG mechanism, which has satisfactory economic properties as well as acceptable computational complexity, and turns to be more suitable for large-size network realization.	access network;computational complexity theory;edmund m. clarke;greedy algorithm;network performance;time complexity;vii;wireless access point	Yulin Jia;Ming Zhao;Kaiwei Wang;Wuyang Zhou	2014	2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992118	simulation;telecommunications;business;computer network	Mobile	29.520808837458425	95.70396877014772	57662

In this paper, we consider possible power saving by reducing the number of active BSs and adjusting the transmit power of those that remain active while maintaining a satisfying service for all users in the network. We thus introduce a joint optimization problem that minimizes the network power consumption of the network and the sum of network user transmission delays. Our formulation allows us to investigate the tradeoff between power and delay by tuning the respective weighting factors. Moreover, to reduce the computational complexity of the optimal solution of our non-linear optimization problem, we convert it into a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem. We provide extensive simulations for various decision preferences such as power minimization, delay minimization and joint minimization of power and delay. The results we present show that we obtain power savings of up to 16% compared to legacy network models.	access network;cobham's thesis;computational complexity theory;depletion region;heuristic (computer science);integer programming;internet;linear programming;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;optimization problem;simulation;wireless access point	Farah Moety;Samer Lahoud;Kinda Khawam;Bernard Cousin	2013	2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666627	minimisation;mathematical optimization;real-time computing;integer programming;nonlinear programming;computer science;linear programming;telecommunications service;computational complexity theory;computer network	Arch	25.27396581043801	93.5308088557429	57829

In this paper, we investigate the robust distributed power control problem in cognitive radio networks by considering the uncertainty of channel gains. Our objective is to minimize the total power consumption of cognitive transmitters under both QoS constraint at each cognitive receiver and interference constraint at primary receiver. The uncertainty of channel gain is described using ellipsoid sets and the robust power control problem can be formulated as a semi-infinite programming (SIP) problem. It can be transformed to a second order cone programming (SOCP) problem by considering the worst cases of constraints. We apply the dual decomposition theory to solve the robust power control problem in a distributed way. To reduce the overhead of message passing among all cognitive users, an asynchronous iterative algorithm is then proposed and its convergence is also proved. Numerical results show that when there is uncertainty of channel gains, by using the proposed robust algorithms, both the primary user interference constraint and the target SINR requirement of each cognitive receiver can be guaranteed.	algorithm;channel state information;cognition;cognitive radio;elegant degradation;interference (communication);iterative method;lagrangian relaxation;message passing;numerical method;overhead (computing);second-order cone programming;semi-infinite programming;semiconductor industry;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;transmitter	Shunqiao Sun;Weiming Ni;Yu Zhu	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/icc.2011.5963428	cognitive radio;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;iterative method;computer network	Mobile	35.8511122032639	91.48128134921978	57840
8fd129efbe8b06b376c92a50d5bea37a272e68b0	optimal resource allocation in a price based opportunistic cognitive radio network		In this paper, we consider a cooperative cognitive radio network where the fusion center acts as final decision maker as well as resource allocator. The secondary users access the licensed band only when the primary user is inactive. The fusion center behaves as a profit seeking entity, which charges the secondary users for letting them use the licensed band. However, the fusion center pays a penalty to the primary network for causing interference. Hence to improve detection performance, the fusion center encourages the SUs to perform cooperative spectrum sensing. Moreover, we map the secondary users' average data rate with a payoff. All the secondary users maintain data buffers and pay to the fusion center according to their traffic type. The fusion center tries to maximize it's own utility while maintaining non-negative utilities at the secondary users. Feasible conditions which guarantee non-negative utilities at secondary users are evaluated. We show that the optimal number of observations which is required for spectrum sensing at secondary users strongly depends on the interference penalty paid by the fusion center. The secondary users get time durations for accessing the licensed band according to their stored energies and paid costs to the fusion center.	cognitive radio;data rate units;interference (communication)	Nilanjan Biswas;Goutam Das;Priyadip Ray	2018	2018 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2018.8377236	computer network;resource management;real-time computing;quality of service;cognitive radio;fusion center;remuneration;stochastic game;resource allocation;computer science	Mobile	28.02799830485614	96.91251585651547	58273

More specifically, the C- RAN minimizes the total downlink transmit power subject to the quality of service (QoS) constraints for small cell user equipments (SUEs), power budgets of small cells, interference thresholds for macro UEs (MUEs), and practical fronthaul capacity constraints. This problem is a mixed integer nonlinear problem (MINLP). Moreover, the problem can become infeasible which necessitates the employment of some form of admission control (AC). Therefore, relying on the framework of successive convex approximation (SCA), we propose a low-complexity solution for the original non- convex MINLP by solving a series of convex problems, which is guaranteed to converge to a local optimum solution. Numerical results indicate the performance of the proposed formulation and demonstrate the underlying tradeoffs among the SUEs' QoS requirements, number of admitted SUEs, total downlink transmit power, and the available fronthaul capacity.	approximation;c-ran;converge;convex optimization;digital subchannel;interference (communication);local optimum;mathematical optimization;multitier architecture;network performance;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method;optimization problem;quality of service;radio access network;requirement;telecommunications link	Amr Abdelnasser;Ekram Hossain	2014	2015 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7417612	telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;baseband;interference;computer network	Embedded	31.466959383158457	92.13825544858008	58602

In return, it rewards the SUs with an incentive time during which they can use the complete licensed bandwidth to transmit their own data, without the need for spectrum sensing. With the objective of maximizing the time incentive, we develop a MAC layer resource allocation strategy and a corresponding routing technique. A low-complexity decoupled cross-layer design is proposed to make the symbiotic relaying scheme practically workable. Simulation results are provided, which are indicative of the effectiveness of the proposed design.	cognitive radio;computational complexity theory;data rate units;design rationale;entropy maximization;ibm systems network architecture;microsoft research;relay;routing;simulation;throughput;transceiver	Vinay Thumar;Taskeen Nadkar;Uday B.

Our goal is to design an optimal MIMO beamforming for secondary users (SUs), considering imperfect interference channel-state information (CSI). Specifically, we optimize the energy efficiency (EE) of SUs, given that the transmission power constraint, the robust interference power constraint, and the minimum transmission rate are satisfied. To solve the optimization problem, we first characterize the uncertainty of CSI by bounding it in a Frobenius-norm-based region and then equivalently convert the robust interference constraint to a linear matrix inequality (LMI). Furthermore, a feasible ascent direction approach is proposed to reduce the optimization problem into a sequential linearly constrained semidefinite program, which leads to a distributed iterative optimization algorithm for deriving the robust and optimal beamforming. The feasibility and convergence of the proposed algorithm is theoretically validated, and the final experimental results are also supplemented to show the strength of the proposed algorithm over some conventional schemes in terms of the achieved EE performance and robustness.	algorithm;beamforming;channel state information;interference (communication);iterative method;linear matrix inequality;mimo;mathematical optimization;matrix multiplication;optimization problem;semidefinite programming;social inequality;times ascent	Daxin Tian;Jianshan Zhou;Zhengguo Sheng;Victor C.

The secondary users can adapt the spectrum buying behavior (i.e., evolve) by observing the variations in price and quality of spectrum offered by the different primary users or primary service providers. The primary users or primary service providers can adjust their behavior in selling the spectrum opportunities to secondary users to achieve the highest utility. In this paper, we model the evolution and the dynamic behavior of secondary users using the theory of evolutionary game. An algorithm for the implementation of the evolution process of a secondary user is also presented. To model the competition among the primary users, a noncooperative game is formulated where the Nash equilibrium is considered as the solution (in terms of size of offered spectrum to the secondary users and spectrum price). For a primary user, an iterative algorithm for strategy adaptation to achieve the solution is presented. The proposed game-theoretic framework for modeling the interactions among multiple primary users (or service providers) and multiple secondary users is used to investigate network dynamics under different system parameter settings and under system perturbation.	algorithm;cognitive radio;game theory;interaction;iterative method;nash equilibrium	Dusit Niyato;Ekram Hossain;Zhu Han	2009	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2008.157	game theory;mathematical optimization;cognitive radio;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;iterative method;computer network	Metrics	35.12977654988601	94.59015571191942	58759

Assuming the data symbols of each user is only known by one eNB, a novel RNTP-based resource block (RB) allocation scheme is presented and carried out in two steps: 1) Each eNB partitions RBs for celledge and cell-center users, and then transmits such information to other eNBs within RNTP bit maps; 2) Based on the received RNTP bit maps, a novel scheduling algorithm is proposed to allocate RBs for cell-edge and cell-center users in each eNB. Simulation results show that the proposed RNTP-based RB allocation scheme improves the cell-edge users' performance, and yields up a certain overall cell throughput enhancement.	algorithm;compaq lte;interaction;interference (communication);map;scheduling (computing);simulation;telecommunications link;throughput	Ying Wang;Weidong Zhang;Fei Peng;Yuan Yuan	2013	2013 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2013.6555099	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;scheduling;computer network	Mobile	28.32370770618603	89.40118979082187	59611

In particular, we focus on the time-varying nature of the observation quality of the environment in practical networks which leads to uncertainty in satisfying QoI requirements specified by end users. The goal of this paper is to meet QoI requests from end users with minimum resources. Specifically, power is allocated dynamically depending on observation accuracies and QoI requirements. We formulate a dynamic scheme for scheduling with the objective of minimizing the energy consumption at the network while satisfying constraints on outage probability for QoI. Lyapunov stability arguments are used to define a policy based on the instantaneous observation qualities and QoI requirement satisfaction levels. Numerical results demonstrate that significant improvements in delivered QoI are realized with identical power expenditure using our QoI-aware resource allocation algorithm compared with traditional maximum-rate schedulers.	algorithm;downtime;information sensitivity;lyapunov fractal;memory management;requirement;scheduling (computing)	Ertugrul Necdet Ciftcioglu;Antonios Michaloliakos;Konstantinos Psounis;Thomas F.

As a consequence, solving the use case of CCO is particularly difficult. This letter proposes an efficacious modification of the antenna tilt-based SON algorithm by Berger et al. We propose using a probability distribution function (PDF) of throughput measurements and an estimate of the number of covered and uncovered users of each cell considered for optimization in order to construct an objective function that is better suited to jointly maximize throughput and coverage. Due to the limited amount of data required for computing the algorithm's objective function, the SON solution proposed can be implemented not only following a centralized but also following a distributed architecture. Simulations show that the SON algorithm can exploit this additional information to increase its performance in terms of throughput gains.	algorithm;centralized computing;correctness (computer science);distributed computing;loss function;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;organizing (structure);portable document format;self-organization;simulation;throughput	Sascha Berger;Albrecht J.

The bandwidth under consideration may be either in an unlicensed spectrum or in an unused licensed band. Spectrum sharing is achieved via a mechanism in which a cognitive radio acting as the auctioneer advertises spectrum availability to bidding cognitive radios and defines a puzzle to solve as a method to access it. The cognitive radios act as bidders by computing the solution to the problem (i.e., the “puzzle”). The winner is the bidder who submits the first correct bid and thus gains access to the spectrum for the next time interval. We consider two different variances of our scheme based on parallelizable and non-parallelizable problems and demonstrate that the latter provides a fair auction in contrast to the former. We propose a verification database to counter malicious “greedy” players. Our algorithm provides a centralized, easy-to-implement, and computationally fast multiple-access scheme that is verifiable by all participating cognitive radios.	accessibility;broadcast delay;centralized computing;cognitive radio;distributed database;formal verification;greedy algorithm;malware;processing delay	Khashayar Kotobi;Philip B.

b9b0bf5168675e86b8f01c1158f70abd5862c7fd	an adaptive time division scheduling based resource allocation algorithm for d2d communication underlaying cellular networks		This paper proposes an adaptive time division scheduling (ATDS) based resource allocation algorithm for device-to-device (D2D) communication underlaying cellular networks. The proposed ATDS algorithm introduces an adaptive TDS strategy, in which all D2D pairs in a cellular system are adaptively scheduled into a series of timeslots for communication based on an improved proportional fairness algorithm. For a particular timeslot, the scheduling priority of each D2D pair is first determined based on both the data transmission rate and the rate satisfaction ratio of each D2D pair. Then, a set of D2D pairs are assigned to the timeslot based on the priorities determined and only those D2D pairs with higher priorities are assigned to the timeslot. After that, the spectrum resources of cellular users are allocated for each D2D pair assigned to the timeslot. Simulation results show that the proposed ATDS algorithm can not only achieve a larger system throughput but also achieve a better fairness as compared with a couple of resource allocation algorithms that do not use time division scheduling.	algorithm;fairness measure;memory management;proportionally fair;randomized algorithm;scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput	Jun Zheng;Biwei Chen;Yuan Zhang	2014	2015 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7417632	fair-share scheduling;transmitter;real-time computing;max-min fairness;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;rate-monotonic scheduling;resource management;distributed computing;interference;computer network	Embedded	28.01337928699954	92.56506416472567	60083

Spectrum sensing methods are often used for finding free channels to be used by CR. Recently, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing system (OFDM) has been suggested as a candidate technology for multicarrier-based CR systems. However, one problem that appears in OFDM systems is the high Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR). In this paper, the effect of PAPR reduction of the primary signal on the performance of the multiband joint detection for wideband spectrum sensing and the profit of the primary user will be investigated. Moreover, the optimal solutions for the multi-band joint detection for the non-cooperative and cooperative schemes will be analyzed by considering the primary user's PAPR reduction. Also, the wideband cooperative spectrum sensing to improve the signal detection with high reduction in the PAPR will be suggested. Simulation results show that the PAPR reduction decreases the total price of the primary user and the aggregate opportunistic throughput of the secondary user. The cooperative scheme is effective in improving the performance in terms of the aggregate opportunistic throughput with PAPR reduction.	power architecture platform reference	Hefdhallah Sakran;Mona Shokair;S.

Aiming at improving the user's quality of experience, we study the network selection problem with time-varying user demand and non-uniform network handoff costs in a dynamic environment. One appealing solution in converging the time-vary user demand and the diverse network performance is dynamic network selection, which, however, poses the dilemma between satisfying user demand and controlling the network handoff cost. To get around this problem, we propose an online network selection algorithm to learn the optimal network selection policy with network handoff cost consideration. In addition, we exploit the inherent dependency in the problem and derive another two algorithms with much faster convergence speed. Simulations reveal that the proposed algorithms can achieve 10%~ performance gain over existing methods.	computer simulation;network performance;on the fly;selection algorithm	Zhiyong Du;Qihui Wu;Panlong Yang	2014	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2014.011214.132617	throughput;real-time computing;intelligent computer network;wireless wan;network architecture;heterogeneous network;quality of service;convergence;network management station;computer science;wireless network;network simulation;distributed computing;computer network	Metrics	24.67671787852023	96.90332791256101	60110

We jointly consider the constraints of quality of service (QoS), maximum power, and minimum rates in the network to obtain optimal available subcarrier sets and transmission power. The fairness of resource allocation is guaranteed by incorporating the probability that a subcarrier is occupied into the link capacity expression. We present a distributed subcarrier selection and power allocation algorithm and evaluate the algorithm through simulations. Our results confirm that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of throughput, the number of secondary links admitted, and the fairness of resource allocation.	algorithm;cognitive radio;fairness measure;frequency divider;hoc (programming language);loss function;maximum power transfer theorem;modulation;multi-user;optimization problem;quality of service;simulation;spectral efficiency;subcarrier;throughput	Songtao Guo;Yunqiang Zhang;Yuanyuan Yang	2011	2011 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference - GLOBECOM 2011	10.1109/GLOCOM.2011.6134317	wireless ad hoc network;max-min fairness;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;distributed computing;computer network	Robotics	32.71560469514747	91.21892374974524	60247

The SM is connected to the geo-location database (GLDB) to periodically obtain the available spectrum fragments, and is responsible for assigning the available spectrum to the white space devices (WSDs) in its coverage region. The spectrum available is usually fragmented with different bandwidths, and the bandwidth required by the WSDs can also be diverse. Unlike existing works which assume complete knowledge of all WSDs' bandwidth requirements before assignment, we consider the more practical settings that WSDs request bandwidth in a sequential manner. Upon the arrival of a bandwidth request, the SM has to determine which fragment the request should be assigned to, without a prior knowledge of the bandwidths of the future requests. We are interested in designing the spectrum assignment policy at the SM upon each arrival of bandwidth request. The above problem is formulated as a stochastic sequential decision-making problem. The optimal spectrum assignment policy to maximize the overall spectrum utilization of the TVWS network is computed through the value iteration method. We demonstrate the performance advantage of our proposed optimal spectrum assignment policy over two heuristic policies through numerical results. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first paper that addresses the modeling and design considering the sequential behaviors of WSDs for GLDB-based TVWS network.	bandwidth (signal processing);centralized computing;geolocation;heuristic;iteration;markov decision process;numerical analysis;requirement;white spaces (radio)	Yiyang Pei;Yugang Ma;Edward Chu Yeow Peh;Ser Wah Oh;Ming-Hung Tao	2015	2015 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2015.7127441	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network;bandwidth allocation	EDA	27.797664026317587	96.87862632230262	60288

In this paper we discuss how to distribute radio resource management in a multi-radio access network, and identify three main distribution strategies: network centralized, network distributed and finally the option of having multi-access radio resource management located in the terminal. A combination of network distributed and terminal based radio resource management appears to be the best choice for dynamic multi-access radio resource management in most scenarios.

In this paper, we investigate the uplink interference situation in 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long-Term Evolution (LTE) HetNet and the corresponding impacts on the efficiency of UL link adaptation, with the focus on small cells. It is observed that the efficiency of UL link adaptation of LPN cells is seriously affected by a small number of dominant interferers. In addition, we study two Uplink Coordinated Multi-point (UL CoMP) schemes which exploit the fluctuation nature of UL interference strength to mitigate the influences. A simplified approach to perform cooperative link adaptation for HetNet is also addressed. System level simulations are carried out to evaluate these schemes, and promising performance gains are observed.	compaq lte;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;quantum fluctuation;requirement;simulation;software deployment;telecommunications link	Qiang Li;Yu-chun Wu;Shulan Feng;Philipp Zhang;Yongxing Zhou	2013	2013 IEEE 77th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2013.6692492	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	Mobile	26.51709074733789	89.04763795569303	60881

In particular, we develop a unified cross-layer model that captures interaction between the physical and network layers. By partitioning each cell into cell partitions we can explicitly model the inter-cell interference and location-dependent users' QoSs. This enables us to design an efficient BS switching mechanism that can maintain user QoS requirements while exploiting heterogeneous traffic distribution over space and time for energy saving. In addition, we develop a power control algorithm that can further improve the energy efficiency. Specifically, we propose a power control strategy that adjusts the cell zooming level for the chosen network configuration by using non-cooperative game theory. We prove that the proposed power control algorithm converges to the Nash equilibrium of the corresponding power control game. Importantly, the proposed BS switching and cell zooming design can be implemented distributively. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy and the significant energy saving gains of the proposed algorithms via numerical studies.	algorithm;control theory;game theory;interference (communication);nash equilibrium;numerical analysis;quality of service;requirement	Long Bao Le	2012	2012 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2012.6503333	real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	28.703174143256206	91.91862982316603	61084

Many of the decision making will need an optimization core for determining the optimum assignment for the control variables. This needs to be on-line to take care of the dynamics of the network and user contexts with strict time budgets. Moreover the overall network system is highly non-linear and often the state relations are analytically not tractable. An efficient search algorithm using a system model incorporating aspects of system ontology is be of value. Here a signed graph based methodology is proposed to incorporate the knowledge of influence relationship between state variables to guide a heuristic optimization process. The proposed methodology is illustrated using a typical wireless link optimization problem.	care-of address;cobham's thesis;cognition;cognitive network;cognitive radio;combinatorial optimization;heuristic;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;online and offline;ontology (information science);optimization problem;search algorithm;signed graph	P.

In the schemes with active link protection, the signal to interference plus noise (SINR) requirements of the new users are gradually approached without violating the existing links. In this paper, we consider a downlink cellular scenario, in which new nomadic cells seek admission to the network. A distributed power control algorithm with active cell protection is presented, where a cell is said to be active if it has sufficient resources to support the connected users and, otherwise, it is said to be inactive. With the proposed algorithm, inactive cells lower their loads by gradually performing power ramping, while active cells scale their transmission power accordingly, to avoid being overloaded. We prove the active cell protection property and compare the convergence of the algorithm under different interference assumptions. Further, we present an algorithm for adapting the power ramping factor in power limited scenarios for further performance enhancements.	algorithm;control theory;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);requirement;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;telecommunications link	Zhe Ren;Markus Jäger;Slawomir Stanczak;Peter Fertl	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2015.7248842	telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	26.35709353430787	93.26770727897521	61184

The existing routing approaches in cognitive radio networks (CRN) do not take into account spectrum trading as well as spectrum competition among licensed users (PUs). This paper introduces a novel routing algorithm that is based on spectrum trading and spectrum competition for cognitive radio networks while supporting different QoS levels for unlicensed users (SUs). The proposed path selection algorithm among different paths is based on user profiles which contain parameters such as SU identification, number of hops, channel identification, neighbor identification, probabilities of idle slots and PU presence. Each node shares its profile with the neighbor PU, which then exchanges its profile with other PUs and decides based on the information received. In spectrum trading phase a PU calculates its price based on the SU requirements. In spectrum competition phase a new coefficient α is defined that controls the price because of competition among PUs and depends on many factors such as the number of primary users, available channels, and duration of the usage. All possible paths are managed and categorized based on the level of QoS requested by SUs and the price offered by the PU.	categorization;coefficient;cognitive radio;ibm systems network architecture;quality of service;requirement;routing;selection algorithm;superuser;user profile	Saed Alrabaee;Anjali Agarwal;Nishith Goel;Marzia Zaman;Mahmoud Khasawneh	2012	2012 Seventh International Conference on Broadband, Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications	10.1109/BWCCA.2012.106	routing;cognitive radio;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	28.203848558061686	95.43362857507016	61297

Large part of this promise is going to be fulfilled by ultra dense network(UDN). However, dense network suffers from interference challenges. In this work, we investigated the performance of interference aware dynamic pilot scheduling scheme for UDN using 3D map based channel model. Initial Pilot scheduling has been carried out using location-aware scheduling scheme which results in minimum tolerable level of channel state information (CSI) error. Following initial schedule, dynamic rescheduling has been carried out by letting 20% of users to move at constant speed towards their respective destination. The impact of different design criteria such as pilot reuse distance, deployment planning, and the frequency of rescheduling (as signaling over head) for various user density and mobility are assessed. Moreover, the probability of successfully rescheduling users within the coherence time has been studied for the dynamic scheduling scheme. Results show that dynamic pilot scheduling scheme has higher probability of successfully rescheduling users in high mobility environment. Furthermore, this work demonstrates that locationaware pilot scheduling with received signal strength (RSS) based rescheduling scheme can be taken as a promising solution to the CSI uncertainty problem so that the full advantage of enabling technologies of 5G can be utilized.	algorithm;channel (communications);channel state information;control plane;interference (communication);location awareness;overhead (computing);rss;scheduling (computing);semi-continuity;simulation;software deployment;velocity (software development)	Estifanos Yohannes Menta;Kalle Ruttik;Riku Jäntti	2017	2017 IEEE Conference on Standards for Communications and Networking (CSCN)	10.1109/CSCN.2017.8088635	channel state information;scheduling (computing);dynamic priority scheduling;real-time computing;fair-share scheduling;interference (wave propagation);two-level scheduling;schedule;communication channel;computer science	Mobile	25.285612526852777	89.91833489011432	61320

A unique characteristic of this problem is the tradeoff between sufficient indoor coverage and limited outdoor leakage, which has to be met without explicit knowledge of the environment. In this paper, we address the small base station(SBS) transmit power assignment problem based on stochastic bandit learning with a continuous set of arms to avoid the constant performance loss or heavy workload on initialization caused by crude or excessive sampling in the previous strategies. With the aim of minimizing the expected cumulative performance loss, we capture the unimodality of the performance function which efficiently accelerates the search for the globally optimal power value. Simulations mimicking practical deployments are performed for both single and multiple SBS scenarios, and the resulting power settings are compared to the state-of-the-art solutions. Significant performance gains of the proposed algorithms are observed.	algorithm;assignment problem;coat of arms;computer simulation;deployment environment;interference (communication);maxima and minima;online machine learning;performance tuning;power glove;sampling (signal processing);smart battery system;software deployment;spectral efficiency;spectral leakage;triune continuum paradigm	Zhiyang Wang;Cong Shen	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC Workshops)	10.1109/ICCW.2018.8403499	workload;unimodality;real-time computing;computer science;transmitter power output;deployment environment;assignment problem;signal-to-noise ratio;initialization;convergence (routing)	Mobile	31.779741894054478	96.43264135436924	61564
65e2d526cf0294e5afc32ee9d7d77594ad5f02ac	resource allocation for ofdm relaying wireless power transfer based energy-constrained uav communication network		This paper proposes an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) relaying wireless power transfer based protocol for energy-constrained unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication network. At the first step of the proposed protocol, the energy-constrained UAV separates the received signals into two disjoint subcarrier groups to perform energy harvesting (EH) and information decoding (ID). At the second step, UAV forwards the received information signals with the energy harvested a priori. Based on the proposed protocol, this paper aims to find the joint optimization of subcarrier grouping and power allocation for maximizing the transmission rate under the EH constraint. We further solve such a joint resource allocation problem via dual decomposition after transforming it into an equivalent convex optimization problem. Simulation results indicate that the performance of our proposed protocol can be significantly improved for the OFDM relaying based UAV communication network.	aerial photography;convex optimization;demultiplexer (media file);exception handling;frequency divider;lagrangian relaxation;mathematical optimization;multiplexing;optimization problem;simulation;subcarrier;telecommunications network;unmanned aerial vehicle	Weidang Lu;Shanzhen Fang;Yi Gong;Liping Qian;Xin Liu;Jingyu Hua	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC Workshops)	10.1109/ICCW.2018.8403627	real-time computing;resource management;resource allocation;subcarrier;telecommunications network;computer science;computer network;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;wireless power transfer;decoding methods;convex optimization	Robotics	34.816442866385614	89.9673979267639	61573

The joint transceiver beamformer design is introduced to minimize the transmit power at secondary base station (SBS) while simultaneously controlling the interference to primary users (PUs) and satisfying the secondary users (SUs) signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) based on the convex optimization method. Due to the limited cooperation between SBS and PUs, the channel state information (CSI) usually cannot be obtained perfectly at the SBS in cognitive system. In this study, both perfect and imperfect CSI scenarios are considered in the beamformer design, and the proposed method is robust to CSI error.

5ccbaf1e4dffeced2d345f3a3813fab27d133795	on energy efficiency of prioritized iot systems		The inevitable deployment of 5G and the Internet of Things (IoT) sheds the light on the importance of the energy efficiency (EE) performance of Device-to- Device (DD) communication systems. In this work, we address a potential IoT application, where different prioritized DD system, i.e., Low-Priority (LP) and High-Priority (HP) systems, co-exist and share the spectrum. We maximize the EE of each system by proposing two schemes. The first scheme optimizes the individual transmission power and the spatial density of each system. The second scheme optimizes the transmission power ratio of both systems and the spatial density of each one. We also construct and analytically solve a multi- objective optimization problem that combines and jointly maximizes both HP and LP EE performance. Unique structures of the addressed problems are verified. Via numerical results we show that the system which dominates the overall EE (combined EEs of both HP and LP) is the system corresponding to the lowest power for low/high power ratio (between HP and LP systems). However, if the power ratio is close to one, the dominating EE corresponds to the system with higher weight.	internet of things;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimization problem;software deployment	Abdulrahman Alabbasi;Basem Shihada;Cicek Cavdar	2017	GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254464	communications system;real-time computing;software deployment;resource management;efficient energy use;computer science;internet of things;optimization problem;transmission (mechanics)	EDA	25.221865333958167	90.66428634944252	61793

However, the success of dynamic spectrum access will not be possible without the evolution of an spectrum and service market which is both stable and efficient. In this paper, we investigate the dynamic access spectrum from the economic point of view. We study three-layer spectrum market with spectrum holder, wireless service provider and end users. In a duopoly situation, two wireless service providers participate in bandwidth competition to purchase spectrum and price competition to attract end users, with the aim of maximizing their own profit. We formulate the wireless service providers' competition as a two-stage game. Under general assumptions about the pricing and demand functions, a unique equilibrium is identified as the outcome of the game, which shows the stability of the market. We further evaluate the market efficiency in a special case of symmetric wireless service providers and affine pricing and demand functions. The result shows the efficiency of the equilibrium is of reasonable level even with non-cooperative wireless service providers.	entropy maximization;existential quantification;multitier architecture;nist hash function competition;next-generation network	Juncheng Jia;Qian Zhang	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2008.928	service provider;pricing;spectrum management;game theory;spectrum;efficient-market hypothesis;tiered service;demand curve;profitability index;bandwidth allocation	Mobile	29.64551106781788	95.7048148998051	62323

However, realization of this technology in today's multiple input multiple output (MIMO) wireless systems requires the sophisticated design of joint computation offloading and other communications functions such as channel state information (CSI) estimation and resource allocation. In this paper, we study the optimization of computation task offloading and resource allocation in MIMO wireless systems considering perfect and imperfect CSI estimation. Our design aims to minimize the maximum weighted energy consumption (Min-max W.C.E) subject to practical constraints on computing and radio resources and service latency. The optimal and sub-optimal algorithms are proposed to solve the underlying mixed integer non-linear problem (MINLP). In particular, the bisection search and difference of convex (DC) optimization methods are employed to determine the global and sub-optimal solutions for the perfect and imperfect CSI scenarios, respectively.

In particular, we propose: (1) A novel cost function (to be minimized) that contains, in addition to the common load factors, other utilization ratios for aggregate capacity, codes, power, and users without service. (2) A novel encoding scheme, and modifications for the crossover and mutation operators, tailored for resource assignment in WCDMA networks. The experimental work points out that our GGA approach exhibits a superior performance than that of the conventional method (which minimizes only the load factors), since all users receive the demanded service along with a minimum use of the assigned resources (aggregate capacity, power, and codes).	genetic algorithm	Lucas Cuadra;Sancho Salcedo-Sanz;A.

However, the corresponding traffic overhead for massive channel state information (CSI) acquisition poses a serious obstacle to the design objective of achieving low network latency. This paper studies a cache-aided dense Fog-RAN by proposing a topo-logical content delivery approach to maximize the achievable degrees-of-freedom (DoF) based only on the network topologies and side message information. Specifically, we present a generalized low-rank matrix completion approach, for which, we propose a Riemannian trust-region algorithm based on Burer-Monteiro factorization to solve a fixed rank subproblem in complex field by semidefinite lifting.

56be41bcdab720a11011f6372d24217b9204c29d	mobile edge computing via a uav-mounted cloudlet: optimal bit allocation and path planning		Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been recently considered as means to provide enhanced coverage or relaying services to mobile users (MUs) in wireless systems with limited or no infrastructure. In this paper, a UAV-based mobile cloud computing system is studied in which a moving UAV is endowed with computing capabilities to offer computation offloading opportunities to MUs with limited local processing capabilities. The system aims at minimizing the total mobile energy consumption while satisfying quality of service requirements of the offloaded mobile application. Offloading is enabled by uplink and downlink communications between the mobile devices and the UAV that take place by means of frequency division duplex (FDD) via orthogonal or non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes. The problem of jointly optimizing the bit allocation for uplink and downlink communication as well as for computing at the UAV, along with the cloudlet’s trajectory under latency and UAV’s energy budget constraints is formulated and addressed by leveraging successive convex approximation (SCA) strategies. Numerical results demonstrate the significant energy savings that can be accrued by means of the proposed joint optimization of bit allocation and cloudlet’s trajectory as compared to local mobile execution as well as to partial optimization approaches that design only the bit allocation or the cloudlet’s trajectory.	approximation;cloudlet;computation offloading;duplex (telecommunications);edge computing;frequency divider;mathematical optimization;mobile app;mobile cloud computing;mobile device;motion planning;non-functional requirement;telecommunications link;unmanned aerial vehicle	Seongah Jeong;Osvaldo Simeone;Joonhyuk Kang	2016	CoRR			Mobile	30.110156867117745	90.85655167871177	64046

Previous approaches for this problem are based on semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and require randomization and costly power scaling which is avoided in our approach. The proposed technique can be viewed as a non-trivial extension of the iterative second-order cone programming (SOCP) approach, which is restricted to the case of instantaneous (rank-one) CSI, to the beamforming problem with higher-rank channel covariance matrices. Computer simulations reveal that the proposed technique exhibits superior performance in terms of total transmitted power at a reduced computational complexity as compared to the SDR method.	beamforming;channel state information;computation;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;conic optimization;etsi satellite digital radio;image scaling;iterative method;lagrangian relaxation;linear programming relaxation;multicast;quality of service;second-order cone programming;transmitter	Nils Bornhorst;Marius Pesavento	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288605	covariance matrix;mathematical optimization;convex optimization;quality of service;second-order cone programming;theoretical computer science;mathematics;iterative method;computational complexity theory	Robotics	37.39842716615352	90.39748912108135	64182
39167d33d909bed85e41b3ae43078426cc854437	novel subcarrier pairing strategy for df relayed secure ofdma with untrusted users		This paper investigates joint resource allocation problem involving subcarrier allocation, subcarrier pairing (SCP), and power allocation for maximizing sum secure rate in a decode-and-forward (DF) relay assisted OFDMA system with untrusted users. Optimal SCP is highlighted as a novel notion of channel gain tailoring rather than conventional channel gain matching. It is proven that the optimal SCP intends to pair subcarriers such that the variance between the effective channel gains is minimized. It is also shown that depending on the individual power budget constraints at source and the relay, SCP can take either a subordinate role for improving the energy efficiency or the main role of improving the spectral efficiency of the system. SCP as a channel gain tailoring strategy and its role in improving the spectral as well as energy efficiency of cooperative secure communication are highlighted through the simulation results.	direction finding;relay;secure communication;simulation;spectral efficiency;subcarrier	Ravikant Saini;Deepak Mishra;Swades De	2017	2017 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2017.8269225	computer network;subcarrier;power budget;computer science;secure communication;resource allocation;pairing;communication channel;spectral efficiency;relay	Mobile	34.823475524972906	89.11061232894244	64224
b677b25f32ffb3271ffcd1722fa1dea21d0e5644	a big data deep reinforcement learning approach to next generation green wireless networks		Recent advances in networking, caching and computing technologies can have great impacts on the developments of green heterogeneous wireless networks, where different sizes of cells co-exist. Nevertheless, these important enabling technologies have traditionally been studied separately in the existing works on wireless networks. In this paper, we propose an integrated framework that can enable dynamic orchestration of networking, caching and computing resources to improve the performance of green heterogeneous wireless networks. We use an energy-efficient caching strategy based on storing maximum-distance separable (MDS) encoded packets. The resource allocation strategy in this framework is formulated as a joint optimization problem. The decision on how to allocate the dynamic resources is very complicated when considering networking, caching and computing. Therefore, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning approach, which can effectively handle systems with large complexity. In addition, we use Google TensorFlow to implement deep reinforcement learning. Simulation results with different system parameters are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.	approximation algorithm;big data;cache (computing);mathematical optimization;optimization problem;reinforcement learning;simulation;tensorflow	Ying He;Zheng Zhang;Yanhua Zhang	2017	GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254717	orchestration (computing);wireless network;computer network;dynamic priority scheduling;big data;reinforcement learning;network packet;computer science;optimization problem;resource allocation	Mobile	25.015688812710312	94.74855384977448	64346

However, this method may as well reduce the coverage and hence it is not evident whether the energy savings can compensate for the network throughput reduction. In this paper, we propose and analyze two sleep mode strategies, namely random and strategic sleeping, for energy efficient cellular networks. Using stochastic geometry, we model the switching off BS operation and obtain analytical results for the coverage probabilities and the area spectral efficiency under different cell sleeping strategies. Specifically, the effect of proposed sleep mode policies on the power consumption and on the energy efficiency is investigated. We first show that the performance gains depend on the level of background noise. Furthermore, numerical results show the effectiveness of an activity-based sleeping strategy in maximizing the energy efficiency of macrocellular networks.	numerical analysis;sleep mode;spectral efficiency;throughput	Yong Sheng Soh;Tony Q.

The spectral-energy efficiency trade-off is of primary significance to determine how much energy per bit is required in a wireless communication system to achieve a specific spectral efficiency. In this paper, we study energy-efficient resource allocation scheme for Orthogonal Frequency- Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) systems with multiple users. The trade-off between spectral and energy efficiencies is analyzed under the constraint of maintaining the fairness among users. We first formulate the energy-efficient optimization problem as an integer fractional programming. We then apply an iterative fractional method to simplify the problem to integer linear programming (ILP) problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the impact of user's quality of service (QoS) is minor on the energy efficiency when a large spectral efficiency is required.	fairness measure;fractional programming;integer programming;iterative method;linear programming;mathematical optimization;multi-user;optimization problem;quality of service;simulation;spectral efficiency;subcarrier	Fourat Haider;Cheng-Xiang Wang;Harald Haas;Erol Hepsaydir;Xiaohu Ge	2012	2012 IEEE 75th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VETECS.2012.6240331	channel allocation schemes;mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;real-time computing;integer programming;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;quality of service;energy conservation;computer science;linear programming	Embedded	30.874298875964787	91.96347133808455	64432

dd590dbd24667b8c80c26e9373fec6bb0fd1df40	investigating the energy-efficiency/delay jitter trade off for volte in lte downlink		The term Energy Efficiency (EE) is turning out to be a radical characteristic for today's 4G networks — which provide energy-hungry wireless services — especially from the battery-limited devices' perspective. In addition to the EE, meeting firm levels for the quality-of-service (QoS) of those energy demanding applications is inevitable. In this paper we study the EE of the user equipment (UE) in the LTE downlink and the delay jitter as a fundamental QoS metric for various real-time applications. The study focuses mainly on the Voice over LTE (VoLTE) traffic as being a heavily used service. We provide a multiobjective optimization for both the EE and the delay jitter subject to fixed delay budget. To address the complexity of the proposed optimal scheduler, two different heuristic algorithms were developed. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed schedulers achieve better trade-off for the EE versus the delay jitter compared to existing state-of-the-art schedulers.	algorithm;compaq lte;heuristic;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;packet delay variation;quality of service;real-time clock;scheduling (computing);telecommunications link	Karim Hammad;Abdallah Moubayed;Serguei Primak;Abdallah Shami	2017	2017 IEEE 28th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2017.8292492	user equipment;computer network;real-time computing;multi-objective optimization;quality of service;telecommunications link;efficient energy use;trade-off;computer science;resource allocation;jitter	Embedded	25.65678952972816	93.19860143890385	65202

An MVNO seeks transmission opportunities (TXOPs) on the PO’s licensed spectrum channel(s) by spectrum sensing. Since licensed primary users (PUs) often have higher transmission priority, TXOPs available to the MVNO are directly determined by PUs’ transmission behaviors. In this paper, we present the first study that uses a pricing scheme to regulate PUs’ transmission behaviors so that TXOPs for an MVNO are improved, meanwhile quality-of-service (QoS) of PUs can be guaranteed as well. Our idea is to design a non-uniform pricing scheme that regulates PUs to transmit based on a time-varying non-uniform transmission cost. We model the optimal pricing problem as a hierarchical game where the interaction between the PO and PUs is modeled as a Stackelberg game and the spectrum random access among PUs is modeled as a non-cooperative game. We first solve the non-cooperative game among PUs, as a building block, then we embed its outcome to a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework to solve the whole optimal pricing problem. We strictly shows that there could be multiple optimal pricing schemes for a PO.

The objective is to jointly perform user selection and design analog-digital hybrid beamformers in order to maximize a given utility function while satisfying various pertinent constraints. The problem is combinatorial and impractical to solve optimally for a large system. In order to overcome the problem we develop a low-complexity heuristic algorithm. We propose a novel metric to judiciously select a predefined number of appropriate users and to pick congruent analog beamformers from a given dictionary based on the sparse regression techniques. Complementary digital beamformers are then designed for the selected users and fixed analog beamformers. Through simulations we analyze the performance of the proposed technique and compare it with the performance of standard techniques.	algorithm;beamforming;dictionary;heuristic (computer science);load balancing (computing);mimo;mathematical optimization;matrix multiplication;multi-user;optimization problem;relevance;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;sparse matrix;utility	Ganapati Hegde;Marius Pesavento	2018	2018 IEEE 10th Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop (SAM)	10.1109/SAM.2018.8448558	mathematical optimization;mimo;computer science;architecture;heuristic (computer science);linear programming;signal-to-noise ratio;base station;beamforming	Mobile	35.25184994571793	90.97939768184627	65390

A design focusing on a given (pre-specified) primary system is expected to result in improved performance, by exploiting system's specific operational features. This paper provides a suitable system model and a highly efficient opportunistic spectrum assignment algorithm under an infrastructure-based architecture, assuming a mobile WiMAX network as the primary system.	algorithm;function model	Dimitris Tsolkas;Dionysis Xenakis;Nikos I.

To deal with this, techniques for increasing the capacity of the cell must be adopted. Clustering nodes into small groups with low power will enable reusing the available frequency and thus expanding the capacity of the network. In this paper, clustering is implemented in a way to configure the nodes into groups each having one cluster-head (CH) that communicates directly with the Base Station (BS), while other nodes, called slaves, relay their communication through cluster-head nodes. The implementation of different clustering strategies that are adapted for the LTE environment is proposed. Two of the well-known clustering algorithms, namely K-means and the Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC), are used for this purpose. Moreover, the use of selection strategy for configuring the nodes is also implemented and compared with the other two clustering techniques. A proper frequency allocation and power control scheme is implemented in order to avoid excessive interference and get valid clustering formations in all cases.	algorithm;blocking (computing);cluster analysis;compaq lte;computer cluster;frequency allocation;high-availability cluster;interference (communication);k-means clustering;relay;requirement;user requirements document;whole earth 'lectronic link	Maryam Hajjar;Ghadah Aldabbagh;Nikos Dimitriou	2015	2015 21st Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC)	10.1109/APCC.2015.7412593	constrained clustering;data stream clustering;real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering;hierarchical network model;computer network	Mobile	26.70019872482244	88.76156498606301	65860

In this paper, we investigate the downlink resource allocation problem for on-demand CM services in HSR OFDMA systems with a cellular/infostation integrated network architecture. The resource allocation problem is formulated as a two-stage optimization programming, which aims at maximizing the total reward of delivered services then minimizing the weighted total number of cumulative discontinuity packets over the trip of the train. An equivalent one-stage programming is proposed to resolve the difficulty of multi-stage optimization. The resultant mixed integer programming (MIP) is NP-hard in general, we thus reformulate it as a sparse ℓ0-minimization problem and then relax it to a linear programming (LP). Furthermore, a reweighted ℓ1-minimization technique is applied to improve the system performance. Simulation results are provided to validate the proposed algorithms.	approximation algorithm;circuit minimization for boolean functions;cobham's thesis;data integrity;hierarchical state routing;itil;integer programming;linear programming;mathematical optimization;np-hardness;network architecture;optimization problem;reflections of signals on conducting lines;resultant;scott continuity;simulation;sparse matrix;telecommunications link;throughput	Yan Lei;Qian Yang;Chao Shen;Shengfeng Xu;Ning Zhang;Zhangdui Zhong	2015	2015 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2015.7127738	multi-frequency network;real-time computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Robotics	26.354143818051092	94.68704426287302	66157

In most previous works on relay-based cellular networks, scheduling at relay stations (RSs) is not allowed. Hence, each RS should immediately transmit all the received data from the base station (BS) in the first phase in a time-slot to mobile stations (MSs) in the second phase in the same time-slot. In this strategy, the effective data rate of the two-hop transmission (BS-RS and RS-MS) is limited to the rate of the link with worse channel state among two links. Hence, in those systems, even though opportunistic scheduling is allowed in the BS, time-varying channel state of each link cannot be fully exploited, which may result in wastes of radio resources. However, if opportunistic scheduling is allowed not only at the BS but also at each RS, the BS and each RS can fully exploit time-varying channel state of each link, so that more efficient radio resource allocation is possible. We formulate a stochastic optimization problem that aims at maximizing the average sum-rate of relay-based networks where the time-varying wireless channel is modeled as a stochastic process. By solving the problem, we develop an optimal power scheduling algorithm which can be implemented in a distributed manner at the BS and each RS. Simulation results show that by allowing opportunistic scheduling at both the BS and RSs, we can improve system performance more significantly.	algorithm;broadcast relay station;crew scheduling;data rate units;download;internet relay chat;location-based service;mathematical optimization;multi-user;optimization problem;reed–solomon error correction;scheduling (computing);simulation;stochastic optimization;stochastic process	Byung-Gook Kim;Jang-Won Lee	2009	2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917864	fair-share scheduling;stochastic process;cellular network;real-time computing;telecommunications;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;base station;operating system;round-robin scheduling;scheduling;computer network	Mobile	31.890533802613216	88.95939090742097	66777

In this technique, some of the transmission resources are allocated to common pilot signals which constitute a significant overhead in current standards. This can be traced to the worst-case design approach adopted in these systems where the pilot spacing is chosen based on extreme condition assumptions. This suggests extending the set of the parameters that can be adaptively adjusted to include the pilot density. In this paper, we propose an adaptive pilot pattern scheme that depends on estimating the channel correlation. A new system architecture with a logical separation between control and data planes is considered and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is chosen as the access technique. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can provide a significant saving of the LTE pilot overhead with a marginal performance penalty.	aqua;best, worst and average case;channel state information;compaq lte;direct-broadcast satellite;elegant degradation;frequency divider;marginal model;memory management;multiplexing;overhead (computing);simulation;systems architecture	Abdelrahim Mohamed;Oluwakayode Onireti;Muhammad Ali Imran;Ali Imran;Rahim Tafazolli	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2015.7248657	real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;base station;lte advanced;pilot;correlation;physical layer	Robotics	28.03075133837983	88.85313562890589	66849

Considering a utility function for each terminal, the purpose of power control in wireless data networks is to maximize network utility. In the proposed game, the pricing function is a linear function of the terminal's signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR). We first prove that the new game is a supermodular game and then we show the strategy space of the new game is such that it is possible to reach better equilibrium point compared to pricing function based on terminal's power. Simulation results show that the game with the proposed pricing function can improve the utility and power consumption of the terminals at equilibrium.	computer terminal;control theory;interference (communication);linear function;network utility;personal computer;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;supermodular function	Abdorasoul Ghasemi;Karim Faez;Mehdi Dehghan	2006	IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VTCF.2006.249	pricing;multipath propagation;game theory;minimax;equilibrium point;decision-making;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;quality of service;telecommunications;power control;computer science;path loss;economic model;wireless network;zero-sum game;algorithmic game theory;computer network	Mobile	31.28897208473555	95.14671328895754	66964

f1ebb960bca2d50cd5426cabfa216ffec14fefad	an examination of the benefits of scalable tti for heterogeneous traffic management in 5g networks		The rapid growth in the number and variety of connected devices requires 5G wireless systems to cope with a very heterogeneous traffic mix. As a consequence, the use of a fixed transmission time interval (TTI) during transmission is not necessarily the most efficacious method when heterogeneous traffic types need to be simultaneously serviced. This work analyzes the benefits of scheduling based on exploiting scalable TTI, where the channel assignment and the TTI duration are adapted to the deadlines and requirements of different services. We formulate an optimization problem by taking individual service requirements into consideration. We then prove that the optimization problem is NP-hard and provide a heuristic algorithm, which provides an effective solution to the problem. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm is capable of finding near-optimal solutions to meet the latency requirements of mission critical communication services, while providing a good throughput performance for mobile broadband services.	greedy algorithm;heuristic (computer science);mathematical optimization;mission critical;np-hardness;numerical method;optimization problem;requirement;scalability;scheduling (computing);spectral efficiency;throughput;time complexity	Emmanouil Fountoulakis;Nikolaos Pappas;Qi Liao;Vinay Suryaprakash;Di Yuan	2017	2017 15th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks (WiOpt)	10.23919/WIOPT.2017.7959871	latency (engineering);computer network;computer science;throughput;scalability;real-time computing;scheduling (computing);heuristic (computer science);transmission time interval;traffic mix;optimization problem	Embedded	26.15258693688392	93.91934539309466	68116

Our study shows that there exists a counterpart linear MUT scheme for any given linear MUD scheme. The counterpart linear MUT can be readily designed from the original linear MUD associated with considering the power constraint on the transmitted signals as well as the availability of the knowledge about the noise presenting at the remote terminals. With the aid of our obtained theory, then, three types of MUT algorithms are derived and investigated in correspondence with the well-known linear processing schemes in the fields of MUD, including matched-filtering (MF), zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean-square error (MMSE).	algorithm;mud;mathematical optimization;multi-user;preprocessor;program optimization;transmitter;whole earth 'lectronic link;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding	Lie-Liang Yang	2007	2007 IEEE 65th Vehicular Technology Conference - VTC2007-Spring	10.1109/VETECS.2007.398	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;matched filter	EDA	38.67756530687896	89.1665999916143	68453

We consider the forward link of a single cell with orthogonal codes and voice traffic. The base station announces a price per unit transmitted power and a price per code, and the users respond according to their individual utilities. The objective is to set prices to maximhe either total user utility or total revenue. The solution to the former problem (maximize utility) is presented. To study the latter problem we derive the large system revenue as the number of users and codes tend to infinity with 6xed ratio. The large system revenue depends on the distribution of utilities and path loss across the user population, and may not be a unimodal function of the prices. Numerical results based on a simple model €or user utility show how the optimal prices and revenue vary with the offered load.	code;telecommunications link	Peijuan Liu;Michael L.

In fact, interference from other users in the same cooperation cluster is turned into useful signal energy in such systems. While cooperation is generally beneficial, the system behavior largely depends on the power control and scheduling strategies employed, as demonstrated in this paper. We investigate different combinations of these two mechanisms and provide insights into the system behavior considering spectral efficiency, fairness and energy efficiency.	algorithm;consensus dynamics;control theory;fairness measure;interference (communication);scheduling (computing);spectral efficiency;systems design;telecommunications link;throughput	Fabian Diehm;Guo-Xiong Chen;Gerhard P.

Our solution for the problem relies on a resource coordination scheme that utilizes the spatial distribution of the transceivers for channel reuse and time-slot division multiplexing for downlink transmission sharing among all participating BSSs. In this paper we show that an OBSS environment can be modeled by a planar graph and the OBSS group coordination assignment problem can be considered as a vertex coloring problem whose solution involves at most four colors. The graph coloring solution algorithm for the OBSS group coordination assignment is presented. The actual coloring is demonstrated, using a heuristics of Maximum Degree First.

In this paper, we consider the two-dimensional optimization to lexicographically minimize the on-grid energy consumption in heterogeneous networks (HetNets). All the base stations (BSs) therein are envisioned to be powered by both power grid and renewable energy sources, and the harvested energy can be stored in rechargeable batteries. The lexicographic minimization of on-grid energy consumption involves the optimization in both the space and time dimensions, due to the temporal and spatial dynamics of mobile traffic and green energy generation. The reasonable assumption of time scale separation allows us to decompose the problem into two sub-optimization problems without loss of optimality of the original optimization problem. We first formulate the user association optimization in space dimension via convex optimization to minimize total energy consumption through distributing the traffic across different BSs appropriately in a certain time slot. We then optimize the green energy allocation across different time slots for an individual BS to lexicographically minimize the on-grid energy consumption. To solve the optimization problem, we propose a low complexity optimal offline algorithm with infinite battery capacity by assuming non-causal green energy and traffic information. The proposed optimal offline algorithm serves as performance upper bound for evaluating practical online algorithms. We further develop some heuristic online algorithms with finite battery capacity which require only causal green energy and traffic information. The performance of the proposed optimal offline and online algorithms is evaluated by simulations.	causal filter;convex optimization;heuristic;imperative programming;lexicographical order;lexicography;mathematical optimization;norm (social);online algorithm;online and offline;optimization problem;rechargeable battery;simulation	Dantong Liu;Yue Chen;Kok Keong Chai;Tiankui Zhang;Maged Elkashlan	2015	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2470659	renewable energy;mathematical optimization;simulation;computer science;engineering;resource management;mathematics	Metrics	25.5871611924474	93.69548506839364	69833
f9b3f5fd00d6ae9c1c15bd2efec5cb5148bc2dd9	signal and interference alignment via message passing for mimo interference channels		A novel algorithm for the design of linear precoding and equalisation in multiple-input multiple-output interference channels is proposed that is based on the minimisation of the interference-plus-signal leakage. The interference-plus-leakage criterion, unlike the more conventional interference leakage metric for interference alignment, considers not only the power of the interference caused to unintended receivers but also the power of the useful signal that is u0027spilledu0027 outside the receiving subspace of the intended receiver. The proposed algorithm tackles the problem via the application of the min-sum message passing algorithm to a factor graph constructed on the interference graph of the network. The scheme can be seen as a generalisation of a number of previously proposed algorithms, including the alternating optimisation schemes for interference leakage minimisation and interference-plus-signal leakage minimisation. The approach inherits the advantages of these schemes of returning unitary precoding and equalisation matrices, hence simplifying the task of low-rate feedback to the transmitters and receivers, and of allowing a distributed implementation. Numerical results show that the scheme provides advantages in terms of achievable sum-rate and convergence with respect to the mentioned existing related strategies.

The problem can be transformed into a series of convex weighted sum rate problems and iteratively solved by standard solvers. However, even with the efficient interior-point method in the latest solver, the computational effort to solve the convex problem in each iteration is still prohibitively high. We propose an efficient algorithm that utilizes the convexity of the rate region to reduce number of iterations. It consists of power bisection and optimal user weights search. The algorithm avoids the full search for the optimal user weights. By continuously constructing a convex rate polyhedron, it determines the feasibility of the current rate target at a early phase and immediately goes to the power bisection without knowing the optimal user weights. The proposed algorithm is compared with the existing methods and is shown to be significantly more efficient than the existing methods in terms of computational complexities.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;computation;convex function;convex optimization;eisenstein's criterion;interior point method;iteration;mimo-ofdm;multi-user mimo;numerical analysis;polyhedron;solver;telecommunications link;weight function	Xiaojia Lu;Antti Tölli;Markku J.

To mitigate the cross-tier interference, the neighboring area where the macro mobile station (MMS) is regarded as neighboring MMS (NMMS) is decided according to the average signal-to-interference-ratio (ASIR) threshold; then the total spectrum resource is partitioned by the femtocell and its NMMS. Subsequently, RA for each femto-cell is implemented as a strategic non-cooperative game by which the inter-femto interference is mitigated. Simulation results show that better performance can be achieved in terms of macrocell throughput, femtocell throughput on each subcarrier, MMS and femto mobile station (FMS) CDF of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), with negligible femtocell throughput sacrifice.	function-behaviour-structure ontology;geometric modeling;interference (communication);iterative method;multitier architecture;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;subcarrier;throughput;traffic collision avoidance system	Shiying Han;Boon-Hee Soong;Quang Duy La	2012	IEEE international Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting	10.1109/BMSB.2012.6264260	channel allocation schemes;electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;co-channel interference;computer network	Mobile	27.47145294072763	89.37602492396606	70172

Unlike the traditional deployment, we consider the scenario with picocell eNodeB (PeNB) at the edge instead of under the umbrella of macrocells in HetNet. In the novel scheme, one PeNB with directional antennas is deployed on the border of neighbor macrocells which is equivalent to a combiner of PeNBs to associate MeNBs around. Compared with the traditional scheme, we have proved that the novel scheme performs better in fairness and efficiency, in terms of coverage area (proportional to offload rate), spectrum and energy efficiency for both edge users and overall users. Meanwhile, the technologies that try to reduce the difference and imbalance of the transmit power in HetNet obtain more inherent gains in the novel scheme, such as cell range expanded (CRE). Our results show that, the scheme proposed is also a spectrum and energy efficient heterogeneous deployment scheme that the energy efficiency is increased from 20% up to nearly 60%.	cell (microprocessor);diplexer;fairness measure;software deployment	Qiuyan Liu;Peng Zhang;Yuping Zhao	2013	JNW	10.4304/jnw.8.10.2422-2428	real-time computing;heterogeneous network;telecommunications;computer science;lte advanced;operating system;efficient energy use;computer network	Mobile	25.77949705822772	90.12637038674816	70191

In this paper, we propose dynamic spectrum access algorithms allowing relay-assisted downlink to opportunistically transmit over the uplink spectrum, thereby maximizing its usage efficiency. Specifically, uplink sub-carrier allocation and scheduling based on spectrum sensing are jointly designed for minimizing received interference and thereby enhancing throughput under the constraint of interference. The proposed algorithms support both centralized and distributed implementation.

However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no effective scheduling algorithms with low complexity and overhead in CoMP-CSB scenario as yet. Thus, in this paper, we propose three novel opportunistic scheduling algorithms in CoMP-CSB scenario. All of them jointly consider the intended channel condition of the scheduled user from its serving cell and the orthogonality between the intended channel and the corresponding interference channels to concurrently scheduled users in nearby cells, thus exploiting multi-user diversity (MUD) and mitigating ICI at the same time. Algorithm 1 cooperatively chooses the most orthogonal user pair within a candidate user set in which all users have a large local channel feedback, while Algorithm 2 concurrently schedules the user pair with the largest ratio between the local channel feedbacks and the aforementioned orthogonality within the same candidate user set. Algorithm 3 performs in the way similar to the proportional fairness scheduling, while making a proper modification for its usage in CoMP-CSB scenario. The performance of the proposed scheduling algorithms are evaluated through simulation. Results show that, they all can significantly enhance the received signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) with relatively good fairness guarantee, thus achieving larger throughputs and utilities than several well-known scheduling algorithms. Algorithm 2 even outperforms Algorithm 1 when the aforementioned candidate user set is big enough in size and has a bit more overhead/complexity. Furthermore, Algorithms 3 is the best one among all the three proposed algorithms, but it requires more overhead/complexity than Algorithm 1 and 2. Finally, we give the optimal parameter for all of the three proposed algorithms, which can make a good tradeoff between performance and overhead/complexity.	algorithm;beamforming;catastrophic interference;collection of computer science bibliographies;complexity;crew scheduling;fairness measure;ici (programming language);interference (communication);mud;multi-user;overhead (computing);proportionally fair;scheduling (computing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;throughput	Hao Wang;Nan Liu;Ping Wu;Zhiwen Pan;Xiaohu You	2013	Science China Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-013-4822-9	fair-share scheduling;natural science;real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;rate-monotonic scheduling;distributed computing;computer security	Metrics	31.960829804831626	89.61608959678261	70247
7cd8492d43a353296f07ec3e98f1377d30276a1e	gpi-based secrecy rate maximization beamforming scheme for wireless transmission with an-aided directional modulation		In a directional modulation network, a general power iterative (GPI) based beamforming scheme is proposed to maximize the secrecy rate (SR), where there are two optimization variables required to be optimized. The first one is the useful precoding vector of transmitting confidential messages to the desired user while the second one is the artificial noise (AN) projection matrix of forcing more AN to eavesdroppers. In such a secure network, the paramount problem is how to design or optimize the two optimization variables by different criteria. To maximize the SR (Max-SR), an alternatively iterative structure (AIS) is established between the AN projection matrix and the precoding vector for confidential messages. To choose a good initial value of iteration process of GPI, the proposed Max-SR method can readily double its convergence speed compared to the random choice of initial value. With only four iterations, it may rapidly converge to its rate ceil. From simulation results, it follows that the SR performance of the proposed AIS of GPI-based Max-SR is much better than those of conventional leakage-based and null-space projection methods in the medium and large signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regions, and its achievable SR performance gain gradually increases as SNR increases.	beamforming;confidentiality;converge;expectation–maximization algorithm;floor and ceiling functions;general-purpose input/output;iteration;kernel (linear algebra);large-signal model;mathematical optimization;modulation;nyquist rate;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectral leakage;transmitter	Hai Yu;Siming Wan;Wenlong Cai;Ling Xu;Xiaobo Zhou;Jin Wang;Yongpeng Wu;Feng Shu;Jiangzhou Wang;Jianxing Wang	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2812180		HPC	38.693110186593	89.64741545169832	70389

A network of secondary users (SUs) opportunistically accesses portions of the spectrum left unused by a licensed network of primary users (PUs). A central controller (CC) schedules the spectrum bands detected as idle for access by the SUs, based on compressed measurements acquired by the SUs. The sparsity in the spectrum occupancy dynamics is exploited: leveraging the spectrum occupancy estimate in the previous slot, the CC needs to estimate only a sparse residual uncertainty vector via sparse recovery techniques, so that only few measurements suffice. The sensing probability of the SUs and the spectrum scheduling are adapted over time by the CC, based on the current spectrum occupancy estimate, and jointly optimized so as to maximize the SU throughput, under constraints on the PU throughput degradation and the sensing cost incurred by the SUs. A compact state space representation and decoupling of the state estimator from the CC are proposed: the estimator provides a maximum-a-posteriori spectrum estimate, as well as false-alarm and mis-detection error probabilities for the bins detected as busy and idle, respectively, based on which the CC performs scheduling and sensing decisions. Simulation results demonstrate improvements up to 11% in the SU throughput over a static sensing scheme.	agile software development;algorithm;compressed sensing;coupling (computer programming);elegant degradation;ibm systems network architecture;mathematical optimization;scheduling (computing);simulation;sparse matrix;state-space representation;throughput	Nicolò Michelusi;Urbashi Mitra	2014	2014 52nd Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)	10.1109/ALLERTON.2014.7028585	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering	Mobile	26.589210926834678	97.57112149485894	70615

In CR networks, a spectrum selection scheme is an important process to efficiently exploit the spectrum holes, and an efficient channel allocation scheme must be designed to minimize interference to the primary network as well as to achieve better spectrum utilization. In this paper, we propose a multichannel selection algorithm that uses spectrum hole prediction to limit the interference to the primary network and to exploit channel characteristics in order to enhance channel utilization. The proposed scheme considers both the interference length and the channel capacity to limit the interference to primary users and to enhance system performance. By using the proposed scheme, channel utilization is improved whereas the system limits the collision rate of the CR packets.	channel capacity;cognitive radio;interference (communication);selection algorithm;simulation;throughput	Juhyeon Lee;Hyung-Kun Park	2014	Journal of Communications and Networks	10.1109/JCN.2014.000032	channel allocation schemes;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	27.449103332478494	96.51816056037204	70848

If the network topology is known to all participants, then it is possible to compute an optimal power assignment in polynomial time. In realistic environments, however, such global knowledge is usually not available to every node. In addition, protocols that are based on global computation cannot support mobility and hardly adapt when participants dynamically join or leave the system. In this paper we present and analyze a fully distributed power control protocol that is based on local information. For a set of communication pairs, each consisting of a sender node and a designated receiver node, the algorithm enables the nodes to converge to the optimal power assignment (if there is one under the given constraints) quickly with high probability. Two types of bounded resources are considered, namely, the maximal transmission energy and the maximum distance between any sender and receiver. It is shown that the restriction to local computation increases the convergence rate by only a multiplicative factor of O(log n + log log Ψmax), where Ψmax is the maximal power constraint of the network. If the diameter of the network is bounded by Lmax then the increase in convergence rate is given by O(log n + log log Lmax).	coefficient;computation;converge;embedded system;existential quantification;iterative method;maximal set;network topology;randomized algorithm;rate of convergence;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;time complexity;with high probability	Zvi Lotker;Merav Parter;David Peleg;Yvonne Anne Pignolet	2011	2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM	10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935077	communications protocol;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;real-time computing;convergence;telecommunications;power control;computer science;mathematics;distributed computing;interference;radio receiver;computational complexity theory;signal-to-noise ratio;computer network	Theory	34.12720119918863	94.12526561590674	71003
149892447a1cbc504aba5e1ba9efe4509915e883	effective-capacity based gaming for optimal power and spectrum allocations over big-data virtual wireless networks		Big data transmission on a wireless network environment focuses on sharing the large volume information data with the effective capacity guaranteed. Wireless network virtualization provides an efficient technique to implement the big data transmission by enabling multiple virtual wireless networks (VWNs) to be mapped onto one physical substrate wireless network (SWN), downloading the information data from SWN. One of the most important challenges of this technique lies in how to efficiently allocate the wireless resources of physical wireless networks to the multiple virtual wireless network users, considering the quality of service for the data transmission. To overcome these difficulties, in this paper we propose a novel auction based scheme to resolve the wireless resources allocation problem in terms of transmit power and wireless spectrum. We formulate this wireless resources allocation problem as an auction process where each mobile user bids for the limited wireless resources from physical substrate wireless networks, and competes with the other mobile-user players bidding for the same resources. First, the mobile users derive their bids for transmit powers, which indicate their willingness to pay for the transmit powers, aiming at maximizing their payoffs (performance-gain minus cost) on each subchannel. Then, according to the derived available transmit power on each subchannel, mobile users derive their bids for the number of subchannels, aiming at maximizing their overall payoffs. The SWN assigns these two types of wireless resources to each mobile user according to the bids for all virtual users. Finally, as the mobile users' bidding processes proceed iteratively, our proposed games are guaranteed to converge to the Nash Equilibrium, where the benefits of SWN and mobile users are both optimized, thus maximizing the aggregate effective capacities for our resources-virtualized big data transmission wireless networks. The extensive simulation results obtained validate and evaluate our proposed schemes.	aggregate data;big data;converge;digital subchannel;download;nash equilibrium;quality of service;simulation	Qixuan Zhu;Xi Zhang	2014	2015 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7417711	games;cognitive radio;wireless wan;heterogeneous network;quality of service;wireless site survey;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;resource management;wireless network;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;base transceiver station;municipal wireless network;wi-fi array;fixed wireless;wireless intrusion prevention system;computer network	Mobile	29.619417210712616	94.24368529298283	71026

However, the high traffic demands and the increased number of nomadic users have led dense eNodeB coverage, thus challenging the SON management in terms of energy efficiency. Considering these crucial SON challenges, we propose a novel adaptive network coverage model for energy-efficient SONs using a special spatial optimization method. This novel method is based on the Voronoi diagram optimization to provide the minimum number of active eNodeBs for high energy saving. The proposed model mathematically analyzes all the operating eNodeBs deployed in a specific SON area in terms of the utilization, by identifying them by a two-parameter function. These are the spatial coordinates and the utilization of the eNodeB. This eNodeB-specific mathematical model leads to find the redundant eNodeBs with less utilization, deactivate them and rearrange the coverage area with the remaining active eNodeBs using the Voronoi specific optimization. This optimization is solved by a novel heuristic with the aid of a parameter called assignment factor, in order to maximize the utilization for the remaining active eNodeBs in the green SON architecture. This spatial optimization based algorithm aims to adaptively deploy energy-effective cell coverage. The thorough evaluation results prove the generic energy-efficiency of the proposed adaptive coverage algorithm while maintaining the ENodeB utilization above the satisfying QoS levels.	algorithm;compaq lte;coverage data;heuristic;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;next-generation network;organizing (structure);self-organization;self-organizing map;software deployment;voronoi diagram	Gokhan Secinti;Berk Canberk	2014	2014 IEEE 11th Consumer Communications and Networking Conference (CCNC)	10.1109/CCNC.2014.6866616	simulation;telecommunications;computer network	EDA	25.29593639355078	91.8661904382607	71076

However, care must be taken to ensure that interference from autonomously deployed small cells is tightly controlled when developing such policies. This paper presents a dynamic spectrum access framework that enables small cells employing a specific Radio Access Technology (RAT) to access the spectrum allocated to other RATs as secondary users without degrading the performance of primary RATs. Secondary small cells opportunistically access unutilized spectrum in their coverage area and the protection of primary RATs is achieved by preventing secondary small cells from accessing spectrum when a potential interference scenario is detected. A system where HSPA and LTE-Advanced are co-deployed is considered. Simulation results show that substantial performance gains for both RATs are achieved by increasing spectrum utilization through secondary access for small cells. Furthermore, gains are achieved without degrading the performance of primary RATs.	cognitive radio;compaq lte;interference (communication);simulation	Ahmed Alsohaily;Elvino S.

We then address the associated network-wide spectral efficiency (SE) and energy spectral efficiency (ESE) optimization problems. More specifically, the network's MIMO channels are mathematically decomposed into several effective multiple-input-single-output (MISO) channels, which are essentially spatially multiplexed for transmission. Hence, these effective MISO channels are referred to as spatial multiplexing components (SMCs). For the sake of improving the SE/ESE performance attained, the SMCs are grouped using a pair of proposed grouping algorithms. The first is optimal in the sense that it exhaustively evaluates all the possible combinations of SMCs satisfying both the semi-orthogonality criterion and other relevant system constraints, whereas the second is a lower-complexity alternative. Corresponding to each of the two grouping algorithms, the pair of SE and ESE maximization problems are formulated, thus the optimal SMC groups and optimal power control variables can be obtained for each subcarrier block. These optimization problems are proven to be concave, and the dual decomposition approach is employed for obtaining their solutions. Relying on these optimization solutions, the impact of various system parameters on both the attainable SE and ESE is characterized. In particular, we demonstrate that under certain conditions the lower-complexity SMC grouping algorithm achieves 90% of the SE/ESE attained by the exhaustive-search based optimal grouping algorithm, while imposing as little as 3.5% of the latter scheme's computational complexity.	beamforming;computational complexity theory;concave function;expectation–maximization algorithm;extensible storage engine;java platform, standard edition;lagrangian relaxation;mimo;mathematical optimization;relay;semiconductor industry;spatial multiplexing;spectral efficiency;spectral method;subcarrier;system analysis	Kent Tsz Kan Cheung;Shaoshi Yang;Lajos Hanzo Hanzo	2014	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2014.2348996	communications protocol;mimo-ofdm;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;interference;spatial multiplexing;multiplexing;wireless;statistics;mimo	Mobile	35.54177992349963	89.9335026999068	71203

LR-PON extends the coverage span of PONs from the traditional 20 km range to 100 km and consolidates the multiple optical line terminals (OLTs) and central offices, thus reducing the operational cost and serving many more users. There are two type of LR-PONs: “tree-and-branch” and “ring-and-spur” LR-PON. To “green” the LR-PON and make it energy-efficient, we study a network planning approach based on user behaviors. By considering the different network usage behaviors of different kind of users (i.e., daily bandwidth demand profiles), we can assign users (e.g., business and residential users) efficiently to different wavelengths in “tree-and-branch” or “ring-and-spur” LR-PONs at networking planning stage and achieve high network utilization at all times. Heuristic searches can provide such assignments and their approximate solutions are very close to the lower bound. The behavior-aware user assignment achieves significant improvement over the traditional method in terms of used wavelengths and could thus saves the energy consumed by the LR-PON.	10g-pon;approximation algorithm;file spanning;heuristic;internet access;lr parser;passive optical network;telephone exchange	Luping Shi;S.-S.

To this end, we model the carrier aggregation using an i - th frequency diversity policy, wherein each component carrier is provided with a maximal ratio combining. An ascending order is employed for the aggregation using maximal ratio combining receiver. Additionally, due to the dispersed nature of the channels, we assume an independent but non-identically distributed (i.n.i.d.) η - μ distribution for each channel branch. Having defined this model, we formulate the maximization problem over the transmit power of each CC with frequency diversity provision over the heterogeneous fading channels. The problem is solved using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) as a dual decomposition application providing robustness.

We are interested in improving the utilization of the resources through price adjustments as compared to the case where the prices are kept fixed.

As a remedy to the limited capability of a single node or network, cooperative communication technique has a potential to further improve the performance of cognitive networks, especially for spectrum sensing based cognitive networks. Given that spectrum efficiency of a cognitive network is determined jointly by spectrum sensing and access capabilities, it makes sense to employ cooperative techniques to enhance their performance. This article offers a tutorial on various cooperative techniques in cognitive networks, with its emphasis on spectrum sensing and access based cooperation, interference constraint based adaptive cooperative feedback, rateless network coding based cooperative transmission, and limited cooperation based interference coordination. Finally, numerical results are given to showcase advantages of the proposed cooperative schemes for cognitive networks.	cognitive network;cognitive radio;interference (communication);linear network coding;numerical analysis;spectral efficiency	Xiaoming Chen;Hsiao-Hwa Chen;Weixiao Meng	2014	IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials	10.1109/SURV.2014.021414.00066	cognitive radio;telecommunications;radio resource management;cooperative diversity;computer network	Mobile	34.729121041392624	91.90567151485124	71674

340c24273465156d579a367d1c1b1ec271f66050	a thompson sampling approach to channel exploration-exploitation problem in multihop cognitive radio networks		Cognitive radio technology is a promising solution to the exponential growth in bandwidth demand sustained by increasing number of ubiquitous connected devices. The allocated spectrum is opened to the secondary users conditioned on limited interference on the primary owner of the band. A major bottleneck in cognitive radio systems is to find the best available channel quickly from a large accessible set of channels. This work formulates the channel exploration-exploitation dilemma as a multi-arm bandit problem. Existing theoretical solutions to a multi-arm bandit are adapted for cognitive radio and evaluated in an experimental test-bed. It is shown that a Thompson sampling based algorithm efficiently converges to the best channel faster than the existing algorithms and achieves higher asymptotic average throughput. We then propose a multihop extension together with an experimental proof of concept.	algorithm;cognitive radio;interference (communication);multi-armed bandit;numerical analysis;performance;sampling (signal processing);testbed;thompson sampling;throughput;time complexity	Viktor Toldov;Laurent Clavier;Valeria Loscrì;Nathalie Mitton	2016	2016 IEEE 27th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2016.7794785	mathematical optimization;cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;artificial intelligence;computer network	Mobile	31.086155734939407	96.47038856340554	71721

A power control game is formulated considering both interference between nearby networks and energy efficiency of WBANs. We derive a distributed power control algorithm called ProActive Power Update (PAPU), which can efficiently find the Nash Equilibrium representing the best tradeoff between energy and network utility. A realistic power control procedure is proposed assuming limited cooperation between WBANs. We compare our algorithm with the ADP algorithm where users are punished for interfering with others and we show that our solution can utilize energy much more efficiently by only sacrificing a small amount of network utility. In addition, we show that by adjusting the energy price, PAPU provides a methodology for application scenarios where WBANs have different energy constraints and quality of service requirements.	algorithm;game theory;interference (communication);nash equilibrium;network utility;non-functional requirement;numerical analysis;quality of service;simulation;testbed;usb on-the-go	Gengfa Fang;Eryk Dutkiewicz;Kegen Yu;Rein Vesilo;Yiwei Yu	2010	2010 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference GLOBECOM 2010	10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683900	games;game theory;algorithm design;quality of service;telecommunications;power control;computer science;body area network;distributed computing;interference;efficient energy use;nash equilibrium;wireless;computer network	EDA	30.890092917111357	93.60891706291804	72096

In this paper, we have proposed an efficient scheduling scheme for IEEE 802.16j networks, which maximizes the number of connections that are scheduled in a particular time slot. The proposed scheme schedules the connections based on their priority, which is decided by the quality of service (QoS) requirement of the connections. A selected connection can be scheduled in the current timeslot only if it is not having interference with any of the already scheduled connections. Our algorithm considers scheduling of lower priority connections even if any higher priority connection is not scheduled due to interference. Thus, the delay for lower priority connections is reduced without increasing the delay for higher priority connections. In addition, our algorithm achieves higher frame utilization and higher system throughput by reducing the length of the schedule. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, minimum sum power, subject to meeting user's demand is considered. There are two channel allocation schemes, localized and interleaved. In localized scheme, a block of convective channels in the spectrum is allocated to each user. In interleaved scheme, channels will be spread out over the spectrum and will be distributed equidistantly. It has been previously assumed that when a block of channels is assigned to a user, the same amount of power will be allocated to each channel. However, the power could be used more efficiently without this assumption. We show that the resulting power allocation problem can be solved in linear time and propose an optimal power allocation procedure. Next, the effect of this new power optimization procedure is investigated numerically. In the next part of paper, we prove that for the interleaved scheme, Minimum sum power problem with or without this new power optimization is polynomial solvable. Finally, we numerically compare localized and interleaved SC-FDMA with and without power optimization. The results show that the localized scheme with the new power optimization yields the best performance.	carrier frequency;decision problem;drum memory;frequency divider;internationalization and localization;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;polynomial;polynomial-time approximation scheme;power optimization (eda);time complexity	Ghafour Ahani;Di Yuan;Wei Ding	2016	2016 IEEE 21st International Workshop on Computer Aided Modelling and Design of Communication Links and Networks (CAMAD)	10.1109/CAMAD.2016.7790340	channel allocation schemes;mathematical optimization;telecommunications;computer science	EDA	31.81311463702121	91.91095454614678	72372

In this paper, we consider the two-stage EE optimization problem, which consists of a joint spectrum and power allocation problem in the first stage, and a context-aware D2D peer selection problem in the second stage. We provide a general tractable framework for solving the combinatorial problem, which is NP-hard due to the binary and continuous optimization variables. In each stage, user equipments (UEs) from two finite and disjoint sets are matched in a two-sided stable way based on the mutual preferences. First, the preferences of UEs are defined as the maximum achievable EE. An iterative power allocation algorithm is proposed to optimize EE under a specific match, which is developed by exploiting nonlinear fractional programming and Lagrange dual decomposition. Second, we propose an iterative matching algorithm, which first produces a stable match based on the fixed preferences, and then dynamically updates the preferences according to the latest matching results in each iteration. Finally, the properties of the proposed algorithm, including stability, optimality, complexity, and scalability, are analyzed in detail.

In this paper, we propose a robust power allocation formulation that guarantees the localization accuracy in the presence of parameter uncertainty for network localization. We first consider wireless network localization (WNL) as an example of active localization, and derive sequential upper and lower bounds for the worst-case localization accuracy as well as their convergence rates. Built on these bounds, we transform the robust formulation into a sequence of second-order cone programs (SOCPs) that yield asymptotically optimal solutions. We also develop an efficient near-optimal SOCP-based algorithm using a relaxation method. Then, we extend all the results to passive localization through the example of radar network localization (RNL).

One of the major concerns in VLC implementation is developing resource allocation schemes that maintain or increase channel throughput, ensure fairness and fast link recovery while reducing delay. To address this challenge, the characteristics of VLC channel is modeled in detail mathematically and the resource allocation problem is formulated for a centrally controlled indoor VLC system in this paper. We focus on a VLC system providing location based services and it is shown that the resource allocation problem can be solved by optimal scheduling, and the solution has to consider different transmission scenarios based on different transmitters and receivers' locations. Specifically, a scheduling algorithm using proportional fair principle is proposed and the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperform the maximum rate scheduling and round robin by balancing the user throughput and fairness among users. A prototype of the VLC system is currently under development to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system.	algorithm;diode;fairness measure;interference (communication);location-based service;oled;proportionally fair;prototype;radio frequency;round-robin scheduling;scheduling (computing);simulation;stationary process;telecommunications link;throughput;transmitter;tree network;vlc media player;vector product format	Ojemba Babatundi;Lijun Qian;Julian Cheng	2014	2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992032	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;maximum throughput scheduling;computer network	Mobile	30.865932905029698	89.83148832561508	72994

Each source wishes to transmit its data to its corresponding destination through the relay network. Each relay in the network transmits a properly scaled version of its received signal thereby cooperating with other relays to deliver each source's data to the corresponding destination. Assuming a minimal cooperation among the relaying nodes, we design a distributed beamformer such that the total relay transmit power dissipated by all relays is minimized while, at the same time, the quality of services at all destinations are guaranteed to be above certain pre-defined thresholds. We show that using a semi-definite relaxation approach, the power minimization problem can be turned into a semi-definite programming (SDP) optimization, and therefore, it can be solved efficiently using interior point methods.

The SA-BPS is considered not only to be used for inner layer user pairing within femtocell user equipments (HUEs) to increase spectrum efficiency, but also to be used for cross layer user pairing between HUEs and macrocell user equipments (MUEs) to cancel the cross layer interference from MUEs to HUEs. As a growth control coefficient is used in SA-BPS to control the growth of average BER of users in the pairing group, rapid user BER deterioration can be prevented by adopting a proper coefficient. Simulation results show that, the SA-BPS outperforms RPS, DPS, and the conventional SA algorithm in terms of BER performance, whether used for inner layer user pairing or cross layer user pairing. Also, the mode switching signal to interference ratio (SIR) threshold between inner and cross layer user pairing are obtained by simulation in three cross layer interference power distribution scenarios.	algorithm;bit error rate;coefficient;compaq lte;interference (communication);loss function;mimo;optimization problem;pictbridge;round-robin scheduling;scheduling (computing);simulated annealing;simulation;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;web server;x.690	Jie Wang;Chen Xu;Xiaohu You	2014	Science China Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-014-5120-x	telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Networks	28.4287617413726	92.026725655996	73163

The management of this kind of indoor deployments is very challenging and low complexity inter-cell interference coordination techniques are needed to address the situation of massive interference. This paper proposes a self-configurable coordinated scheduling algorithm, based on a distributed fractional frequency reuse scheme. The algorithm is able to adapt to different load conditions, adjusting the frequency reuse pattern and allocating users to the most appropriate frequency band, depending on the distribution of interference. The performance of the algorithm has been assessed through simulations considering cells and users with multiple antennas, configuration in which the interference coordination algorithms do not usually achieve significant gains. Still being feasible and simple to implement, this algorithm achieves a significant improvement in the power consumption and cell-edge user throughput even in low cell density cases. When increasing the number of small cells, results show also an improvement in the average user throughput and cell spectral efficiency.	algorithm;frequency band;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;olami–feder–christensen model;scheduling (computing);simulation;software deployment;source code control system;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;throughput;wireless access point	Sonia Gimenez;David Martín-Sacristán;Daniel Calabuig;Jose F.

To solve this challenging problem efficiently, we first derive closed-form expressions for the spectral efficiency and the power control parameters (related to per-RAU transmit power constraint) with zero-forcing (ZF) and maximum ratio transmission (MRT) beamforming, and then develop a computationally feasible power allocation algorithm using the tools of fractional programming and sequential convex approximation. The derived closed-form expressions are functions of only slowly changing large-scale fading which enables us to solve the optimization problem over a longer time interval. The proposed power allocation algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker points of the original non-convex EE maximization problem. The simulation results demonstrate the accuracy of the derived expressions and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, some insightful conclusions are arrived at from the EE comparisons between different beamforming schemes (ZF and MRT) and different antenna deployments (distributed and co-located).

9f4c14ac072b1005319b39d66d82c8c2ea240b40	on spectrum sharing among micro-operators in 5g		The growing demand in indoor small cell networks has given rise to the concept of micro-operators (MOs) for local service delivery. We model and analyze a spectrum sharing system involving such MOs where a buyer MO buys multiple licensed subbands provided by the regulator. All small cell base stations (SBSs) owned by a buyer MO can utilize multiple licensed subbands. Once the buyer MO obtain subbands, it allows other MOs to share these subbands. A deterministic model in which the location of the SBSs are known can lead to unwieldy problem formulation, when the number of SBSs is large. As such, we adopt a stochastic geometric model of the SBS deployment instead of a deterministic model. Assuming that the locations of the SBSs can be modeled as a homogeneous Poisson point process, we find the downlink signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) coverage probability and average data rate for a typical user (UE) served by the buyer MO in a spectrum sharing environment. In order to satisfy the QoS constraint, we provide a greedy algorithm to find how many licensed subbands and which subband the buyer MO should purchase from the regulator. We also derive the coverage probability of the buyer MO for interference limited system.	cell (microprocessor);data rate units;geometric modeling;greedy algorithm;itil;interference (communication);micro isv;point process;quality of service;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;smart battery system;software deployment;telecommunications link	Tachporn Sanguanpuak;Sudarshan Guruacharya;Ekram Hossain;R.

Supporting the network with additional BSs increases the total capacity of the network. However, this process may reduce the energy efficiency of the network. The proposed algorithm studies the energy efficiency aspect of the micro BS deployment problem. The deployment problem can be divided into two subproblems: choosing candidate locations for micro BSs and selecting the optimum set among these candidates. Inhomogeneous distribution of the candidate locations is misleading for different user sets. Selecting the optimum micro BSs among the candidate locations is a combinatorial problem. To provide an approximate solution to this problem, we propose a greedy algorithm. Our simulation results demonstrate that by optimizing the BS location and the number of BSs to be deployed, the energy efficiency of the system with only macro BSs can be improved up to 1.4-1.65 times for a range of realistic micro BS transmit power levels.	approximation algorithm;greedy algorithm;semantic network;simulation;software deployment	Cemil Can Coskun;Ender Ayanoglu	2014	IEEE Wireless Communications Letters	10.1109/LWC.2014.2356203	telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	26.000184154851222	91.8857526006565	73298

We perform power allocation across different subcarriers for the source and the relay, as well as subcarrier pairing at the relay, so as to maximize the achievable sum rate subject to individual power budget constraint at each transmit node, and therefore formulate the joint power allocation and subcarrier pairing optimization problem. Due to the interdependency in the power allocation between self-interference subcarrier and outgoing subcarrier at the relay node, we propose a suboptimal scheme to trade the performance for computational complexity. Then dual decomposition technique is employed for power allocation, while the subcarrier pairing problem is solved by Hungarian algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed resource allocation scheme can significantly improve system performance.	computational complexity theory;duplex (telecommunications);hungarian algorithm;interdependence;interference (communication);lagrangian relaxation;mathematical optimization;numerical method;one-way function;optimization problem;relay;simulation;subcarrier	Na Li;Yong Li;Mugen Peng;Wenbo Wang	2016	2016 IEEE 83rd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2016.7504451	electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;resource management;frequency-division multiplexing;relay channel;wireless;computer network	Metrics	35.00332697154875	89.55415353899214	73775

The analysis of the available white space at sea, as well as the framework, is presented. Specifically, a bilevel game with two stages of PUs-to-SUs primary users to secondary users and SUs-to-SUs is proposed, to address the resource allocation issue of Decode-and-Forward DF relay mode with maximal-ratio combining MRC receiving mode in destination. Stackelberg game with priority is employed between PU and SUs, while a symmetrical system model is considered among SUs-to-SUs. The game theoretic procedure that converges to Nash equilibrium based on the utility and payoff function is illustrated. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed strategy could effectively increase the throughput as well as the payoffs of the system.

However, the scarcity of unallocated radio spectrum bands, coupled with the need to provide ubiquitous wireless data services with different Quality of Service (QoS) requirements to a large number of users, has continued to drive extensive research efforts in radio resource management (RRM). In order to adapt to the changing wireless channel conditions and meet the varying and diverse QoS requirements, much of the published work in RRM has focused on exploiting multi-user and multi-channel diversities and more recently on exploiting multi-application diversity to take advantage of the mechanisms and optimization features introduced in the air interfaces. In this paper, we propose a bitQoS-aware resource allocation framework to increase the flexibility and granularity of the resource allocation algorithms by adaptively matching the QoS requirements of the user application bits to the characteristics of the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) subcarriers in a mixed-traffic environment. We show through an adaptive joint subcarrier, power and bit allocation algorithm, that with the finesse control of bitQoS-aware scheduling, it is possible to simultaneously achieve both an increase in user throughput and a reduction in user packet drop probability by accepting a within scheduling delay threshold increase in user latency. The performance gains obtainable are quantified in terms of system throughput, user throughput, user latency, user jitter and user packet drop probability for systems under different traffic loads.	algorithm;assignment (computer science);binary prefix;bisection method;bit-level parallelism;comparison sort;computational complexity theory;conditional (computer programming);fm broadcasting;mathematical optimization;memory management;multi-user;multiplexing;network packet;numerical analysis;overhead (computing);quality of service;radio resource management;requirement;rewrite (programming);sl (complexity);scheduling (computing);simulation;software deployment;sorting;spectral efficiency;star catalogue;subcarrier;throughput	Chi En Huang;Cyril Leung	2012	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2012.2189030	real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;computer network	Mobile	27.812107758086732	92.0896922032293	73900

The power control problem is modeled as a non-cooperative game. The existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium in the game is established, and an iterative water-filling algorithm is proposed to efficiently reach the Nash equilibrium. It is shown that the Nash equilibrium point corresponds to a competitively optimal power allocation in the interference network. Based on this result, an adaptive power control algorithm for upstream VDSL power back-off is developed. The power control algorithm takes into account the loop transfer functions and cross-couplings, and allows the loops to negotiate the best use of power and frequency. This new algorithm is found to have a substantial performance improvement when compared to current methods.	backoff;interference (communication);iterative method;multi-user;nash equilibrium;water filling algorithm	Wei Yu;George Ginis;John M.

The existing schemes in CCRNs allocate the spectrum resource only to the cooperative relay SU. However, this may lead to the waste of spectrum resource, especially when the relay SU has light traffic load or poor channel condition. To better utilize the spectrum among all SUs in a secondary network, we design a spectrum resource utilization maximization scheme with joint consideration of relay selection and spectrum scheduling problems. With the goal to maximize the throughput of the secondary network, our scheme allocates spectrum among all SUs according to the diversity of secondary traffic load and the channel conditions. Besides, considering that the SUs are always energy limited, we also formulate the energy constraint for each SU to avoid the energy consumption exceeding the total available energy. Moreover, we study the resource allocation problem from long-term view under dynamic network setting, and design an online algorithm to solve it. Through extensive simulations, we show that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing schemes in terms of secondary network throughput.	cognitive radio;entropy maximization;online algorithm;relay;scheduling (computing);simulation;superuser;throughput;transmitter	Yan Long;Hongyan Li;Hao Yue;Miao Pan;Yuguang Fang	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2014.6883528	online algorithm;throughput;cognitive radio;simulation;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;manganese;resource management;scheduling;computer network	Mobile	29.822693626255873	93.41812933475953	74884

A network of secondary users (SUs) opportunistically accesses portions of the spectrum left unused by a network of licensed primary users (PUs). A central controller (CC) schedules the traffic of the SUs over the spectrum bands, based on distributed compressed spectrum sensing performed by the SUs. Both sensing and scheduling are controlled based on the current spectrum occupancy belief, with the goal to maximize the SU throughput, under constraints on the PU throughput degradation and the sensing-transmission cost incurred by the SUs. The high optimization complexity is reduced by proposing a partially myopic scheduling strategy, where the total traffic of the SUs is determined optimally via dynamic programming, whereas the allocation of the resulting total traffic across frequency bands is determined via a myopic maximization of the instantaneous trade-off between PU and SU throughputs, which can be solved efficiently using convex optimization tools. Structural results of the partially myopic scheduling strategy are proved. Simulation results demonstrate how the proposed framework allows to balance optimally the cost of acquisition of state information via distributed spectrum sensing and the cost of data transmission incurred by the SUs, while achieving the best trade-off between PU and SU throughput under the resource constraints available.	acknowledgement (data networks);agile software development;convex optimization;dynamic programming;elegant degradation;expectation–maximization algorithm;frequency band;ibm systems network architecture;mathematical optimization;one-class classification;open-shop scheduling;partially observable markov decision process;scheduling (computing);simulation;superuser;throughput	Nicolò Michelusi;Urbashi Mitra	2015	2015 24th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)	10.1109/ICCCN.2015.7288389	fair-share scheduling;mathematical optimization;real-time computing;telecommunications;dynamic priority scheduling;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	26.635607891513377	97.448507168815	75056

Power optimization of mobile radio systems has gained attention of network operators because energy costs make up a huge part of operational expenditure. In this regard, deployments of low power small cell base stations considerably raise the challenge of energy-efficient cellular networks. Network densification refers to densification over space, for example dense small cell deployment like picocell, femtocell, and frequency utilization of larger segments of radio spectrum in dissimilar bands. In this article we have illustrated the cause factors of densification and described its effects. The deployment layouts of different base stations are studied and compared with conventional macro-femtocell systems from the perspective of area power consumption and signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio.

One prominent example is cellular communication where service providers seek to utilize the costly resources in the most effective way. In this work, we investigate an uplink resource allocation scheme that takes into account the buffer occupation at the transmitter to retain a given level of quality of service (QoS). First, we regard exact results for the class of Poisson traffic where we investigate the sensitivity of the resource adaptation and QoS level to the actuating variables. We show relevant resource savings in comparison with a static allocation. Further, we regard a queueing setting with general random arrival and service processes. In particular, we consider the service of wireless fading channels. We show two different resource adaptation mechanisms that depend on the strictness of different assumptions. Finally, we present simulation results that show substantial resource savings using the queue-aware scheduling scheme, where we provide insight on the implementation and operation of such an adaptive system.	adaptive system;algorithm;channel (communications);mathematical optimization;mobile phone;multi-user;quality of service;scenario (computing);scheduling (computing);simulation;telecommunications link;telecommunications network;transmitter	Amr Rizk;Markus Fidler	2015	2015 IFIP Networking Conference (IFIP Networking)	10.1109/IFIPNetworking.2015.7145299	real-time computing;resource allocation;computer science;radio resource management;distributed computing;computer network	Metrics	27.774851731004343	95.50158146534314	75755
fd823e1c6c2c6123d5d40f1b6c835c7f48006554	a novel compressed sensing ultra-wideband channel estimation method based on non-convex optimization	compressed sensing;non convex optimization;channel estimation;ultra wideband	Due to the low power spectral density and complicated transfer propagation of ultra-wideband UWB signal, it is important to estimate UWB channel accurately. But it is difficult to sample UWB signals directly due to their wider band width. However, compressed sensing CS theory provides a feasible way through lower sampling speed. Common CS-UWB channel estimation methods adopt convex optimization, non-sparse or non-restricted form. In order to strengthen the restriction on sparsity of the reconstructed channel vector, a non-convex optimization method is proposed in this paper to estimate UWB channel. Proposed method sets the objective function as a non-convex optimization model using lp-norm. This model is combined as a convex function to approximate the objective function and reconstruct the UWB channel vector iteratively. Because lp-norm is closer to l0-norm than l1 and l2-norm, its restriction on sparsity of objective vector is stricter. The simulation results show that this method can enhance reconstruction performance compared with existing CS-UWB channel estimation methods.

b651df98cb18eabde0942cc350c613fcded2d9c7	ac-poca: anticoordination game based partially overlapping channels assignment in combined uav and d2d-based networks		Device-to-device (D2D)-enabled wireless networks are becoming increasingly popular. However, in remote, rural, and disaster affected areas, it is difficult to construct such wireless networks due to the unavailability or inadequacy of cellular infrastructures. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be a good candidate to promptly construct the D2D-enabled wireless network. However, the assignment of the radio channels of the nodes (i.e., UAVs and user terminals) is challenging due to the availability of only a limited number of orthogonal channels and the interference issue resulted from using arbitrary channels. Furthermore, the dynamic topology and high mobility of nodes in such a combined UAV and D2D-based network make conventional channel assignment (CA) algorithm no longer suitable. In this paper, we formally address this problem, and demonstrate how partially overlapping channels (POCs) and game theory can be exploited to alleviate the problem. In this vein, we propose a distributed anticoordination game based POC assignment algorithm referred to as AC-POCA. In our proposed AC-POCA, the nodes use only local information to play the game, and reach a steady state, uniqueness of which is verified through analysis. Also, the upper bound of AC-POCA (i.e., price of anarchy) is analytically evaluated, which is corroborated by simulation results. In addition, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of AC-POCA in terms of good throughput and low signaling overhead in a dynamic environment.	ac adapter;aerial photography;algorithm;anarchy;game theory;interference (communication);overhead (computing);simulation;steady state;throughput;unavailability;unmanned aerial vehicle	Fengxiao Tang;Zubair Md.

In this paper, first, benefits of RE in the uplink and downlink are reviewed, emphasizing its definitive merit for uplink communications. It is shown that while RE also improves the fairness in the downlink, it may seriously degrade the total system capacity if no ICIC is utilized. Then, a novel cell-selection technique that capitalizes on subframe-blanking at the macrocell is introduced for improving the downlink capacity and fairness. System level simulation results show that the proposed cellselection method adaptively achieves a good balance between sum capacity and fairness, and can be used in place of biasbased cell-selection.	channel capacity;fairness measure;interference (communication);relativistic electron beam;semantic network;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;telecommunications link;throughput	Ismail Güvenç;Moo-Ryong Jeong;Ibrahim Demirdogen;Balkan Kecicioglu;Fujio Watanabe	2011	2011 IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Fall)	10.1109/VETECF.2011.6092863	throughput;electronic engineering;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;interference;signal-to-noise ratio;computer network	HPC	26.756459944062897	88.7771694714384	76274

In each cell, only a subset of the available subchannels are allocated to mobile stations (MS) in a given time slot so as to limit the interference to neighboring cells; also, each base station (BS) uses a fixed transmit power on every allocated subchannel. The objective is to allocate the available subchannels in each cell to the MSs in the cell for downlink transmissions taking into account the channel qualities from BSs to MSs as well as traffic requirements of the MSs so as to maximize the weighted sum of throughputs of all the MSs. First, we show that this problem is NP-Complete. Next, we show that when the potential interference levels to each MS on every subchannel are above a threshold (which is a function of the transmit power and the channel gain to the MS from the BS it is associated with), the problem can be optimally solved in polynomial-time via a reduction to the matching problem in bipartite graphs. Also, we design two heuristic algorithms for the general problem: a greedy distributed algorithm and a simulated annealing based algorithm. The distributed algorithm is fast and requires only message exchanges between neighboring BSs. The simulated annealing based algorithm is centralized and allows a tradeoff between quality of solution and execution time via an appropriate choice of parameters. Finally, we study the performance of the above algorithms via simulations, which show that the distributed algorithm on average achieves an objective function value that is 0.6 times that obtained by the simulated annealing based algorithm using only a small fraction of the number of computations.	analysis of algorithms;cell (microprocessor);centralized computing;computation;digital subchannel;distributed algorithm;greedy algorithm;heuristic;interference (communication);karp's 21 np-complete problems;loss function;optimization problem;polynomial;requirement;run time (program lifecycle phase);simulated annealing;simulation;statistical interference;telecommunications link;time complexity;weight function	Ashwathi Nambiar;Gaurav S.

Resource allocation, as an effective interference mitigation technique, is a key technique in the OFDMA system. In this paper, we investigate a novel resource allocation algorithm based on game theory. Firstly, available subcarriers are allocated according to the normalized channel gain. When it comes to power allocation, a novel non-cooperative game model based on arc tangent function is established. To ensure fairness, we introduce a pricing function to the utility function. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can acquire higher rate than previous algorithms at a reasonable power cost. Moreover, our proposed algorithm can converge within 5 iterations with low complexity.	algorithm;converge;fairness measure;game theory;interference (communication);iteration;performance per watt;simulation;subcarrier;telecommunications link;utility	An Wang;Yueming Cai;Zhao Hou	2011	2011 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2011.6096820	mathematical optimization;simulation;telecommunications;computer science	EDA	32.199281881697296	92.59699390986796	76366
86b2c096ac9ce4e49ecb9db9bb617e677a1de6b9	distributed mode and power selection for non-orthogonal d2d communications: a stochastic approach		The coexistence of device-to-device (D2D) and cellular communications in the same band is a promising solution to the dramatic increase of wireless networks traffic load, in particular in the presence of local traffic, when source and destination nodes are in close proximity. In this case, the mobile nodes can communicate in a semi-autonomous way (D2D mode), with minimal or no control by the base station (BS), but they may create a harmful interference to the cellular communications. In order to avoid it, we design a distributed approach that allows the mobile node to acquire in real time local information by observing few channel and topology parameters. Based on this information, each user can infer in advance not only the quality of its transmission, but also its impact on other ongoing surrounding communications toward the BS. This enables a smart, adaptive mode, and power selection performed with a network wide perspective. Differently from most approaches, this selection is made autonomously by each D2D sources, with no need for a centralized scheduling. We compare our strategy to the state-of-the-art in the same distributed network scenario, showing the importance of exploiting local information for a dynamic, interference aware power, and mode selection.	autonomous robot;centralized computing;coexist (image);distributed mode loudspeaker;interference (communication);pdf/a;scheduling (computing);semiconductor industry	Federico Librino;Giorgio Quer	2018	IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking	10.1109/TCCN.2018.2809721	computer science;wireless network;computer network;quality of service;probabilistic logic;scheduling (computing);telecommunications link;communication channel;cellular network;base station	Mobile	26.277047886078268	90.75196198598405	76571

Although dynamic frequency and power allocation has been well studied separately, very few results have been reported on dynamic joint frequency and power allocation. In this paper, we propose a dynamic frequency and power allocation algorithm for the DownLink (DL) of OFDMA-based cellular networks, where frequency resources are allocated to cells by a central broker to minimize long-term cell-edge inter-cell interference. Moreover, each cell independently assigns its available frequency resources and power to users in a way that its total DL transmission power is minimized while meeting the throughput demands of its users. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm provides significant improvements in network outage performance, capacity, and throughput as compared with existing schemes.	algorithm;centralized computing;downtime;expectation propagation;greedy algorithm;heuristic (computer science);interference (communication);mathematical optimization;memory management;network performance;optimization problem;simulation;telecommunications link;throughput;vii	David López-Pérez;Xiaoli Chu;Jie Zhang	2012	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2012.081412.110705	channel allocation schemes;electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;resource management;computer network	Mobile	28.604722353735088	90.70283443766516	76649

This new communication paradigm, however, requires a well-designed spectrum allocation mechanism. In this paper, we propose an auction framework for cognitive radio networks to allow unlicensed secondary users (SUs) to share the available spectrum of licensed primary users (PUs) fairly and efficiently, subject to the interference temperature constraint at each PU. To study the competition among SUs, we formulate a non-cooperative multiple-PU multiple-SU auction game and study the structure of the resulting equilibrium by solving a non-continuous two-dimensional optimization problem. A distributed algorithm is developed in which each SU updates its strategy based on local information to converge to the equilibrium. We then extend the proposed auction framework to the more challenging scenario with free spectrum bands. We develop an algorithm based on the no-regret learning to reach a correlated equilibrium of the auction game. The proposed algorithm, which can be implemented distributedly based on local observation, is especially suited in decentralized adaptive learning environments as cognitive radio networks. Finally, through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed auction framework in achieving high efficiency and fairness in spectrum allocation.	cognitive radio;converge;distributed algorithm;experiment;fairness measure;frequency allocation;game mechanics;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;one-class classification;optimization problem;programming paradigm;simulation;superuser	Lin Chen;Stefano Iellamo;Marceau Coupechoux;Philippe Godlewski	2010	2010 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM	10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462143	auction algorithm;distributed algorithm;cognitive radio;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network;bandwidth allocation	Mobile	32.53306993113559	93.61994013364537	76707

For the frequency-selective Rayleigh propagation channels, the proposed approach exploits the decoupled direct and image channels, and the knowledge of the effective channel statistics to realize dual linear-minimum-mean-square-error (LMMSE) channel estimators. We develop the pilot power distribution and positioning approach for the training sequence design under the channel mean-square-error (MSE) minimization criterion considering the existence of IQI and guard bands. For the pilot power allocation, we formulate the problem into semi-definite programming whereas positions are assigned with either a heuristic greedy method or fairness instigating genetic combinatorial optimization. Simulation results indicate that with the proposed pilot design, it is possible to achieve a better MSE performance than the conventional MU channel estimation methods and introduce user fairness when selecting pilot composition from the shared pool of resources.	brute-force search;channel (digital image);channel state information;coefficient;combinatorial optimization;computational complexity theory;emoticon;fairness measure;greedy algorithm;heuristic;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;multi-user;numerical analysis;optimization problem;pilot;rayleigh–ritz method;semiconductor industry;semidefinite programming;simulation;software development kit;software propagation;telecommunications link	Aamir Ishaque;Pranav Sakulkar;Gerd Ascheid	2014	2014 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2014.6952234	mathematical optimization;telecommunications;mathematics	EDA	34.976998527791636	90.36742820555787	76982

These requirements demand for efficient and intelligent use of spectrum. The system model and the problem of the optimum spectrum allocation in cognitive radios are introduced and formulated in this paper. We derived a lower limit of the demanded allocations for all the users in the system and obtain the optimal solution which attains this lower bound. An algorithm which finds these optimum values of the demanded allocations is introduced to find the optimum spectrum allocation in time domain. The convergence of this algorithm is shown using the eigen values of the Gram matrices. Simulations are provided to support the mathematical formalism and the convergence of the algorithm to optimal solution.	algorithm;cognitive radio;computer simulation;eigen (c++ library);frequency allocation;game theory;gramian matrix;requirement;semantics (computer science)	Madhusudhan R.

Furthermore, a larger part of the traffic is generated by applications that require high data rates. Techniques including Coordinated Multipoint transmission (CoMP) can increase the data rates, but at the cost of a high overhead. The overhead can be reduced if only a subset of the users is served with CoMP. In this paper, we propose a user selection approach, including pre-selection of CoMP users and short term scheduling, that takes user requirements into account. Users that require a high data rate to reach an acceptable level of service satisfaction are selected to use coherent joint processing CoMP in some of their downlink transmission bandwidth. Simulation results show that both the number of satisfied users and fairness are improved with the proposed user selection as compared to user selection that does not consider individual user requirements.	coherence (physics);control unit;data rate units;fairness measure;multipoint ground;overhead (computing);requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation;telecommunications link;transmission (bittorrent client);user requirements document;utility	Annika Klockar;Mikael Sternad;Anna Brunstrom;Rikke Apelfrojd	2014	2014 11th International Symposium on Wireless Communications Systems (ISWCS)	10.1109/ISWCS.2014.6933479	real-time computing;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;interference;fading;bandwidth;communications system;computer network	Arch	28.707899898555297	89.33819925869462	77165

Besides the important implications for energy consumption, the trend towards densification calls for more and more wireless links to forward a massive backhaul traffic into the core network. It is critically important to take into account the presence of a wireless backhaul for the energy-efficient design of HetNets. In this paper, we provide a general framework to analyze the energy efficiency of a two-tier MIMO heterogeneous network with wireless backhaul under spatial multiplexing and dynamic time division duplex. We find that a two-tier HetNet with wireless backhaul can be significantly more energy efficient than a one-tier cellular network. However, this requires the backhaul bandwidth to be carefully allocated according to the network load conditions.	backhaul (telecommunications);duplex (telecommunications);mimo;multitier architecture;spatial multiplexing;throughput	Howard H.

c68f56695a57b8dd2e13aac1fbb27e9d65d6f280	semrsa: spectrum efficient modulation-aware dynamic routing & spectrum allocation in elastic optical network		Nowadays, Elastic optical network (EON) provides a long term solution to handle enormous volume of data traffic that arises out of recent developments in mobile technologies, cloud computing, video-on-demand etc. In dynamic environment, setting up and tearing down the spectrums in the optical path may generate spectral fragmentation thus presenting a major obstacle for the effectiveness of elastic spectral allocation. A routing and spectrum allocation (RSA) problem in EON is constrained by three factors: spectrum continuity, sub-carrier contiguity and guard band. With Orthogonal Frequency division Multiplexing (OFDM) technologies, EON is able to make efficient use of spectrum based on distance adaptive modulation format. This paper proposes a novel spectral efficient heuristic SEMRSA for dynamic RSA problem in EON by using modulation-aware concept and satisfying those three constraints. Routing in SEMRSA may take preferably single (if possible) / multiple paths for allocating a connection request to guarantee number of sub-carrier requirement for a connection request as low as possible. Simulation results show that SEMRSA results in lower blocking and higher spectral efficiency compared to a recent approach MMRSA which uses multipath routing associated with modulation awareness concept.	blocking (computing);cloud computing;computation (action);fragmentation (computing);frequency allocation;heuristic;modulation;multipath routing;multiplexing;neural network simulation;rsa problem;scott continuity;spectral efficiency;subcarrier	Sudip Bandyopadhyay;Vishal Dey;M.

Here, a multi-antenna relay linearly precodes the received (uplink) signals from multiple users before forwarding the signal in the downlink, where the purpose of precoding is to let each user receive its desired signal with interference from other users suppressed. The problem of optimizing the precoder based on sum-rate maximization criteria is typically non-convex and difficult to solve. The main contribution of this paper is that we show the sum-rate maximization problem can be converted to an equivalent weighted sum-MSE minimization problem and can therefore be solved using an iterative algorithm proposed in our previous work. Asymptotic analysis reveals that, with properly chosen initial values, the proposed iterative algorithms are asymptotically optimal in both high and low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regimes for MIMO switching, either with or without self-interference cancellation (a.k.a., physical-layer network coding). Numerical results show that the optimized MIMO switching scheme based on the proposed algorithms significantly outperforms existing approaches in the literature.	asymptotically optimal algorithm;channel state information;converge;convex function;entropy maximization;expectation–maximization algorithm;initial condition;interference (communication);iterative method;linear network coding;mimo;mathematical optimization;multi-user;numerical method;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;telecommunications link;weight function;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Fanggang Wang;Xiaojun Jenny Yuan;Soung Chang Liew;Dongning Guo	2013	2013 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2013.6555129	linear network coding;multi-user mimo;telecommunications;control theory;mathematics;beamforming;precoding;statistics	Mobile	38.30633672813029	89.77391363060703	77832

Coordinated multipoint (CoMP) communication is a new method that helps with the implementation of dynamic base station coordination for energy efficient communications. On the other hand, the power grid infrastructure is experiencing a significant shift from the traditional electricity grid to the smart grid. In this paper, we consider not only energy efficient communications but also the dynamics of the smart grid in designing green wireless cellular networks. We formulate the system as a Stackelberg game, which has two levels: a cellular network level and a smart grid level. Simulation results show that the smart grid has significant impacts on green wireless cellular networks, and our proposed scheme can significantly reduce operational expenditure and CO2 emissions in green wireless cellular networks.	decision problem;grid computing;multipoint ground;procurement;queueing theory;real-time clock;simulation	Shengrong Bu;Fei Richard Yu;Yegui Cai;Peter Xiaoping Liu	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2012.6364971	game theory;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;smart grid;computer network	Mobile	25.683560670281675	92.6153885344962	77920

In such networks, transmission powers of SUs are limited by an average total transmission power constraint and by a constraint on the average interference power that SUs cause to the primary base-station. We first establish the joint optimality of water-filling power allocation and threshold-based scheduling policies for DTPIL networks. We then show that the secondary network throughput under the optimal DPASP scales according to 1/enh log log (N), where nh is a parameter obtained from the distribution of STSB channel power gains and N is the total number of SUs. From a practical point of view, our results signify the fact that distributed cognitive multiple access networks are capable of harvesting multiuser diversity gains without employing centralized schedulers and feedback links as well as without disrupting primary's quality-of-service (QoS).	access network;centralized computing;interference (communication);multi-user;quality of service;scheduling (computing);throughput;transmitter	Ehsan Nekouei;Hazer Inaltekin;Subhrakanti Dey	2013	2013 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2013.6620510	transmitter;cognitive radio;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;scheduling;computer network	Arch	32.51000473152088	90.68115844555767	78248

Spectrum coordination techniques have been shown to substantially alleviate the crosstalk problem. The equal level of error protection that these techniques provide can however be excessive for some applications. Many applications with diverse error protection requirements can be sharing the same connection. In this paper, two novel rate adaptive spectrum management algorithms are presented that enable a different level of error protection for different applications. The algorithms are generalizations of the globally optimal OSB and the locally optimal DSB algorithms for systems that incorporate unequal error protection. Through simulation, it is shown that unequal error protection can lead to significant performance gains.	algorithm;crosstalk;digital subscriber line;elegant degradation;local loop;local optimum;maxima and minima;oracle service bus;requirement;simulation	Jeroen Verdyck;Paschalis Tsiaflakis;Marc Moonen	2015	2015 23rd European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)	10.1109/EUSIPCO.2015.7362624	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science	EDA	43.60371269032714	90.39148556359717	78524

In this paper, we optimize the transmit precoders, the receiver decoders, and the relay AF matrices to maximize the achievable sum rate. First, the total signal to total interference plus noise ratio (TSTINR) maximization approach is proposed to approximate the sum rate maximization problem as a lower bound. Under individual user and individual relay transmit power constraints, an efficient alternating direction algorithm is proposed to maximize the TSTINR. Then, we modify our TSTINR model as well as the algorithm to guarantee multiple data stream transmission, by requiring the precoding matrices to have a certain number of orthogonal columns. We propose the stream selection for preprocessing, and prove that the stream selection problem to maximize the sum rate is NP-hard. Simulation results show that our proposed stream selection TSTINR model achieves much higher sum rate compared to the existing model with the same computational cost; the proposed algorithm solves the problems efficiently, and the computation time is significantly reduced.	anisotropic filtering;approximation algorithm;column (database);computation;computational complexity theory;expectation–maximization algorithm;interference (communication);mimo;np-hardness;preprocessor;relay;selection algorithm;simulation;time complexity	Cong Sun;Eduard Axel Jorswieck;Ya-Xiang Yuan	2016	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2016.2607143	mathematical optimization;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;interference;computational model;approximation algorithm;statistics;mimo	Mobile	38.772731082687436	89.53544368679579	78587

However, in these systems Inter-Cell Interference (ICI) still poses a real challenge that limits the system performance, especially for users located at the cell edge. Inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC) has been investigated as an approach to alleviate the impact of interference and improve performance in OFDMA-based systems. A common ICIC technique is interference avoidance in which the allocation of the various system resources (e.g., time, frequency, and power) to users is controlled to ensure that the ICI remains within acceptable limits. This paper surveys the various ICIC avoidance schemes in the downlink of OFDMA-based cellular networks. In particular, the paper introduces new parameterized classifications and makes use of these classifications to categorize and review various static (frequency reuse-based) and dynamic (cell coordination-based) ICIC schemes.	adaptive algorithm;autonomous robot;catastrophic interference;categorization;cell (microprocessor);cell signaling;centralized computing;disk sector;elegant degradation;frequency band;ici (programming language);interference (communication);multiplexing;parameterized complexity;real-time clock;scheduling (computing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;subcarrier;telecommunications link;throughput	Abdelbaset S.

In this study, the authors consider the joint optimisation of resource allocation in wireless backhaul links and user-centric clustering in the access links. The objective is to maximise the weighted sum rate of all users under the backhaul resource constraints. To solve this intractable problem, they first adopt the l1-norm approximation approach to convert the non-convex backhaul constraints into the solvable forms. They then reformulate the objective function as a set of second-order cone constraints based on the sequential parametric convex approximation method. An iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the transformed problem based on its special property.

03067055b0304cf78309f064f5c5a651a6164e34	voice capacity over lte in pmr context : challenges and solutions. (capacité de la voix sur lte dans le contexte pmr : défis et solutions)		The Professional Mobile Radio (PMR) network, which is used for public safety operation, has to evolve to the broadband solutions to satisfy the user demands in the future. In the current broadband technologies Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard, developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), is considered as one of the potential candidates for the next generation of PMR. Despite the fact that LTE supports high-speed data transmission and supports different packet sizes by using Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC), LTE is not yet optimized for low bit rate voice communication, especially in case of using LTE in Professional Mobile Radio (PMR) context. Therefore, in this dissertation, we present several new proposed solutions for enhancing the voice capacity of LTE in the PMR context for both uplink and downlink transmission. The new proposed solutions, based on existent LTE standards with minor modifications, allow reducing both control and data overhead of Voice over LTE (VoLTE) in PMR context. After a general introduction, we introduce the Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard in the perspective of PMR network and present the two biggest issues that affect the voice capacity of LTE in the PMR context: data and control overhead in chapter 2. In chapter 3, we introduce our new proposed architecture and our new proposed scheduling method for multiplexing voice packets from different users into one same LTE packet in the downlink transmission to reduce the difference between the LTE packet size and PMR voice payload. In this new proposed architecture, the multiplexing size can be modified according to the Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS), the payload of users and the LTE bandwidth. The new proposed scheduling method is used to transmit the multiplexed packets to corresponding users. This new proposed scheduling method is implemented by negligible modifications in MAC layer. Therefore, this new multicast does not require additional components in LTE architecture. The average voice data capacity gain of the proposed method is about 242.4%. In the best case the proposed method can multiply the voice data capacity by a factor of 7.5. Chapter 4 concentrates on the solutions to reduce the control overhead issue in the multiplexing scheme. In this chapter, two new approaches are developed: RNTI aggregation method and Group RNTI method. The new proposed RNTI aggregation method uses Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) channels with high format, created by the aggregation of PDCCH channels with low format, to transmit several RNTIs of different UEs in a same multiplexing group. In the new proposed Group RNTI method, UEs having the same Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) will be clustered in one or more groups. Each group is assigned a common Group RNTI. Control information is sent for groups rather than for each UE. The new proposed RNTI aggregation method can increase the voice control capacity of the multiplexing scheme up to 170%; while the new proposed Group RNTI reduces the control overhead up to 77%. We also evaluate and compare the two new proposed methods for different scenarios in order to offer recommendations. In chapter 5, we propose another method for enhancing voice capacity of LTE in the PMR context: CDMA-OFDM combination method. In this chapter, we present a new architecture, a novel algorithm for determining the spreading factor, code assignment and resource allocation for the new proposed CDMA-OFDM combination method. In addition, a new design for DMRS for the CDMA-OFDM combination method for the uplink transmission is also discussed in this chapter. The new proposed CDMA-OFDM combination method can be applied for both uplink and downlink. The CDMA-OFDM combination method significantly increases the capacity of VoLTE over PMR context. On average, the proposed CDMA-OFDM combination method can double the voice data capacity in comparison with the LTE standard. While the purpose of the proposed Multi-users Multiplexing method and the proposed CDMA-OFDM combination method is to increase the size of payload, the new proposed Adaptive Physical Resource Block method, presented in chapter 6, is to design a more efficient and more consistent User Assignment Resource Unit for the LTE in the PMR Context. In this proposed method, we reorganize the structure of the Physical Resource Block (PRB) to optimize the voice capacity of LTE downlink in the PMR Context. Available PRBs in each subframe are reorganized into a number of Sub Physical Resource Blocks (subPRBs). The number of control symbols can be selected with more flexibility. The proposed method allows reducing both data overhead and control overhead for Voice over LTE downlink in PMR context. On average, the voice capacity gain is shown to have about 144.5% in comparison with the LTE standard. We compare the advantages and disadvantages of these three new proposed methods for enhancing Voice Capacity over Long-Term Evolution (LTE) in PMR Context: the proposed Multi-users Multiplexing Method, the proposed CDMA-OFDM Combination Method and the proposed Adaptive Physical Resource Block Method in chapter 7. We offer suggestions and recommendations for the use of each method. We conclude and discuss perspectives in chapter 8. In this PhD thesis, we have presented the main challenges affecting the capacity of the voice over LTE in the PMR context. We proposed several new solutions for enhancing capacity of voice over LTE in the PMR context for both uplink and downlink, for both data plan and control plan. Even of these new proposed methods are implemented by negligible modifications of existent LTE standards, the efficiency obtained from these methods is very impressive. On average, the proposed methods can double the voice capacity. These results reaffirm that the existent broadband solutions are not entirely suitable for low data rate applications. Therefore, the service providers need to forecast and take into account the different services when building new standards for the next generation networks (e.g. 5G, 6G) to ensure the efficient use of radio resources. On the basis of analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of three methods, we also recommend of using CDMA-OFDM Combination Method method as the main method for enhancing Voice Capacity over LTE in PMR Context. The CDMA-OFDM Combination method can reduce both control and data overhead and apply to both uplink and downlink without requiring new additional components to the system.	advanced mezzanine card;algorithm;best, worst and average case;compaq lte;linear algebra;mimo-ofdm;modulation;multicast;multiplexing;network packet;next-generation network;overhead (computing);pmr446;scheduling (computing);telecommunications link;uncompressed video;voice command device	Manh Cuong Nguyen	2015				Mobile	27.220284847969968	93.06510987508709	79192

In this model participants cooperate to enable a group of mobile users to access Internet while they have no or limited connectivity. One of the key research problems in UPC is giving incentives to mobile network subscribers to promote active participation. In this work we propose a scheme to give incentives to mobile subscribers of a network assisted User Provided Network (UPN) in which subscribers with limited or no connectivity access Internet while still charging to their own quota. Our scheme proposes a simple and applicable bargaining based mechanism to encourage mobile network subscribers to join the protocol to provide UPC. Since the scheme is network assisted network operators are expected to support and do not impose any restrictions on the protocol. In this scheme utility and cost functions are defined for participants in terms of provided throughput and battery energy, and the protocol operates iteratively as in the case of a real world bargaining.	quality of service	Sinan Emre Tasçi;Ömer Korçak	2016		10.1109/PIMRC.2016.7794851	simulation;telecommunications;computer security;computer network	Theory	30.37910172312371	95.36611285661259	79294

However, such performance enhancement is limited by mutual interference and energy availability, especially when the deployment of D2D links is ultra-dense. In this paper, we present a distributed power control method for ultra-dense D2D communications underlying cellular communications. In this power control method, in addition to the remaining battery energy of the D2D transmitter, we consider the effects of both the interference caused by the generic D2D transmitter to others and the interference from all others caused to the generic D2D receiver. We formulate a mean-field game (MFG) theoretic framework with the interference mean-field approximation. We design the cost function combining both the performance of the D2D communication and cost for transmit power at the D2D transmitter. Within the MFG framework, we derive the related Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman and Fokker–Planck–Kolmogorov equations. Then, a novel energy and interference aware power control policy is proposed, which is based on the Lax–Friedrichs scheme and the Lagrange relaxation. The numerical results are presented to demonstrate the spectrum and energy efficiency performances of our proposed approach.	algorithm;approximation;bellman equation;c date and time functions;finite difference;game theory;gradient;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);hamilton–jacobi–bellman equation;interference (communication);jacobi method;kolmogorov equations;lagrange polynomial;linear programming relaxation;longest common subsequence problem;lookup table;loss function;numerical analysis;numerical method;online and offline;performance;proximity communication;relaxation (approximation);relaxation (iterative method);software deployment;theory;transmitter	Chungang Yang;Jiandong Li;Prabodini Semasinghe;Ekram Hossain;Samir Medina Perlaza;Zhu Han	2017	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2016.2641959	games;transmitter;simulation;telecommunications;power control;computer science;mathematical model;mathematics;interference;efficient energy use;spectral efficiency	Mobile	30.778059312472244	92.20065555460262	79815

The ultimate goal is to minimize the reconstruction distortion at the fusion center. This optimization problem is, unfortunately, non-convex. To circumvent that, we propose two suboptimal strategies: 1) a joint sensor selection and power allocation (JSS-EH) scheme that, we prove, is capable of iteratively finding a stationary solution of the original problem from a sequence of surrogate convex problems and 2) a separate sensor selection and power allocation (SS-EH) scheme, on which basis we can identify a sensible sensor selection and analytically find a power allocation policy by solving a convex problem. We also discuss the interplay between the two strategies. Performance in terms of reconstruction distortion, impact of initialization, actual subsets of selected sensors, and computed power allocation policies is assessed by means of computer simulations. To that aim, an EH-agnostic sensor selection strategy, a lower bound on distortion, and an online version of the SS-EH and JSS-EH schemes are derived and used for benchmarking.	computer simulation;convex function;convex optimization;distortion;exception handling;exponential hierarchy;iteration;javascript style sheets;journal of statistical software;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;scheme;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;stationary state	Miguel Calvo-Fullana;Javier Matamoros;Carles Antón-Haro	2016	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2016.2611859	mathematical optimization;simulation;wireless sensor network;distortion;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;efficient energy use;energy harvesting	AI	36.37901213023675	89.23655427244655	79866

For the access link, a subset of APs are selected to serve the members of each multicast group using joint multicast beamforming technique. For the backhaul link, the orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) technology is adopted schedule the transmission from the BS to the set of APs selected by each UE. To account for the wireless backhaul constraints, the problem is formulated as a joint optimization problem of multicast beamformer design in access links and resource allocation in backhaul links, which is a non-convex mixed integer programming problem. This problem is transformed to a tractable form using the successive convex approximation and re-weighted ℓ1-norm techniques, which is solved using an iterative algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that proposed scheme can converge to the stationary point under different network settings.	algorithm;approximation;backhaul (telecommunications);beamforming;call stack;cluster analysis;cobham's thesis;converge;frequency divider;ibm notes;integer programming;iterative method;linear programming;mathematical optimization;multicast;optimization problem;simulation;sparse;stationary process;taxicab geometry;wireless access point	Huibo Liu;Cunqing Hua;Yifeng Luo	2016	2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)	10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636848	multicast;telecommunications;protocol independent multicast;computer science;distributed computing;source-specific multicast;xcast;computer network	Mobile	31.646854818870217	92.0565390133944	79996
22bcf05d68a973920f1c866f242b1bff6dbb631c	overlapping coalition formation games-based resource allocation for device-to-device communication in lte-a network		In the long-term evolution-advanced system, device-to-device (D2D) communication brings many significant benefits, such as low power consumption, low delay, high bit rates and efficient frequency utilisation. However, these potential advantages hinge on the intelligent resource allocation approach between D2D user equipments (DUEs) and cellular user equipments (CUEs). Different from existing work that focused on the scenario that one CUE shares spectrums with one D2D pair and thus disjoint groups are formed to use spectrums, in our paper, we proposed a coalition formulation game with overlapping coalitions. In this game, we model the resource sharing problem as a transferable coalition formation game where there exists intersection among these coalitions and the DUEs can make a decision to join or leave a coalition according to the merge-and-split rule. Consequently, not only one D2D pair can employ the same resource with multiple CUEs but also the channel of one CUE can be allocated to multiple D2D pairs in order to maximise the frequency efficiency and the system sum throughput. In particular, we consider the practical case and study the effect that only imperfect channel state information (CSI) can be obtained on the stable coalition formation game. A discrete-time Markov chain-based analysis is presented to obtain the stable coalition structure, and the complexity of employing this scheme is evaluated. Extensive numerical results show that the proposed overlapping coalition formulation game-based scheme results in better performance compared to the traditional existing methods even in the imperfect CSI scenarios.

23d96415227e5d6f36d64cbc9d9489188e8cab05	online layered learning for cross-layer optimization of dynamic multimedia systems	cross layer multimedia system design;rate distortion;learning algorithm;cross layer optimization;real time;reinforcement learning;foresighted decision making;multimedia systems;learning methods;layered reinforcement learning;markov decision process;cross layer;cross layer adaptation to support real time requirements	In our recent work, we proposed a systematic cross-layer framework for dynamic multimedia systems, which allows each layer to make autonomous and foresighted decisions that maximize the system's long-term performance, while meeting the application's real-time delay constraints. The proposed solution solved the cross-layer optimization offline, under the assumption that the multimedia system's probabilistic dynamics (e.g. the application's rate-distortion-complexity behavior) were known a priori, by modeling the system as a layered Markov decision process. In practice, however, these dynamics are unknown a priori and therefore must be learned online. In this paper, we address this problem by allowing the multimedia system layers to learn, through repeated interactions with each other, to autonomously optimize the system's long-term performance at run-time. We propose two reinforcement learning algorithms for optimizing the system under different design constraints: the first algorithm solves the cross-layer optimization in a centralized manner, and the second solves it in a decentralized manner. We analyze both algorithms in terms of their required computation, memory, and inter-layer communication overheads. In our experiments, we demonstrate that decentralized learning can perform equally as well as centralized learning, while enabling the layers to act autonomously. Additionally, we show that existing myopic learning algorithms deployed in multimedia systems perform significantly worse than our proposed foresighted learning methods.	algorithm;autonomous robot;broadcast delay;centralized computing;computation;distortion;experiment;interaction;machine learning;markov chain;markov decision process;mathematical optimization;online and offline;real-time transcription;reinforcement learning;run time (program lifecycle phase)	Nicholas Mastronarde;Mihaela van der Schaar	2010		10.1145/1730836.1730843	error-driven learning;simulation;computer science;machine learning;distributed computing	AI	25.090014118970757	97.18722260977925	80811

However, both SeNB and MeNB may suffer significant performance degradation due to inter/intra-tier interference. Meanwhile, the energy efficiency (EE) is another promising requirement especially when SeNB/MeNB are densely deployed. In this paper, a utility function with an α-adjustable parameter is proposed to achieve an optimal tradeoff between EE and SE. Then, an energy-aware capacity offload between the MeNB and multiple SeNBs is formulated as a Nash bargaining game, which is significantly simplified during the following analysis. To attain a win-win optimality for both the relatively involved SeNBs and MeNB, an energy-aware trigger of source-MeNB, interference-related right selected target-SeNB, and mutual interference compensation are all provided in this paper, which help to attain more dimensions of diversities and gains. Finally, simulation results show the improved performance of our proposed scheme.	elegant degradation;interference (communication);multitier architecture;nash equilibrium;simulation;software deployment;spectral efficiency;utility	Chungang Yang;Kun Guo;Min Sheng;Jiangdong Li;Jian Yue	2014	2014 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2014.6952513	telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	30.1061856190033	90.716019048564	80830

A best-response power control algorithm is derived from successive convex approximations, and a single power update is performed at each scheduling interval. In the high-SINR regime, the power control algorithm achieves maximum network throughput. Extending the approach to general SINR (where optimal interference mitigation is NP-hard), we propose queue-driven, convex-approximations power control, together with randomization. Our low complexity algorithms are amenable to distributed implementation, and simulation results illustrate their very satisfactory throughput performance.	approximation;expectation–maximization algorithm;interference (communication);randomized algorithm;real-time clock;scheduling (computing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;throughput	Konstantinos P.

Then, the secondary users (SUs) can bid for spectrum in multiple auction or sealed auction way. In this paper, we address the problem of distributed spectrum sharing in the cognitive networks where multiple owners sell their spare bands to multiple SUs. Each SU equips multi-interface/multi-radio, so that SU can buy spare bands from multiple owners. On the other hand, each owner can sell its spare bands to several SUs. There are two questions to be addressed for such an environment: the first one is how to select bands/the owners for each SU; the second one is how to decide the competitive prices for the multiple owners and multiple SUs. We propose a two-sided \textit{multi-band market game} theoretic framework to jointly consider the benefits of all SUs and owners. The equilibrium concept in such games named \textit{core}. The outcomes in the core of the game cannot be improved upon by any subset of players. These outcomes correspond exactly to the price-lists that competitively balance the benefits of all SUs and owners. We show that the core in our model is always non-empty. The measurement of price is set to discrete value. Subsequently, the core of the game is defined as \textit{discrete core}. The Dynamic Multi-band Sharing (DMS) Algorithm is proposed to converge to the discrete core of the game. With small measurement of price, the algorithm can achieve the optimal performance compared with centralized one in terms of total profit of the system.	algorithm;centralized computing;cognitive network;cognitive radio;converge;multi-user;regular expression;software framework;superuser;theory	Dapeng Li;Youyun Xu;Jing Liu;Xinbing Wang;Zhu Han	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2010.5502755	game theory;cognitive radio;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;computer network	Robotics	31.424637108272588	94.93560050627974	80911

In adaptive CoNap network, multiple neighboring base stations (BSs) form a cluster and each BS operates in either a transmit mode (TM) or a nap mode (NM) in each time slot. The dynamic assignment of TM and NM to each BS is implicitly coordinated among multiple BSs. This implicit coordination is realized by a binary general flickering pattern matrix (FPM) through adaptively selected mapping matrix (MM). To track the time-varying traffic demand, we develop an adaptive algorithm to dynamically select the appropriate MM from a predefined MM set by taking into account the network quality of service (QoS) requirement. Our numerical results based on a realistic energy consumption model in a cellular network show that as high as 40% saving can be achieved without compromising the network QoS.	adaptive algorithm;backhaul (telecommunications);computer simulation;energy drift;numerical analysis;overhead (computing);propt;physical address extension;quality of service;selection algorithm;vehicle identification number;virtual 8086 mode	Koichi Adachi;Jingon Joung;Sumei Sun;Peng Hui Tan	2013	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2013.101613.121873	real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	27.768453545911935	91.65823498291785	81130

Micro base station deployment increases the total capacity of the network. However, increasing the number of micro base stations excessively may reduce the energy efficiency of the network. Therefore, in this paper, we examine the energy efficiency aspect of the micro base station deployment problem. This problem can be divided into two subproblems: choosing feasible candidate micro base station locations and selecting the optimum set of micro base stations among the candidate locations. The proposed algorithm first chooses the subset of the feasible locations as candidate locations, and then selects the micro base stations which maximize the energy efficiency of the network iteratively. It is shown that the proposed algorithm is a constant-factor approximation of the optimal solution. Our simulations demonstrate that proposed algorithm improves the energy efficiency of the network up to 12% for low-loaded scenarios and 98% for the high-loaded scenarios.	approximation;greedy algorithm;heuristic;microsoft windows 98;requirement;semantic network;simulation;software deployment;throughput	Cemil Can Coskun;Ender Ayanoglu	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2015.7248290	mathematical optimization;greedy algorithm;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Robotics	25.92571203252077	92.00065878933539	81198

Meanwhile, along with the recent contribution to performance enhancement with the frequency reuse-1 for Licensed-Assisted Access using LTE (LAA) system, we propose a new scheme, referred to as alignment reference interval adaptation-based LAA (ARIA-LAA), by combining the advantages of each conventional scheme into a unified access framework. Our simulation results demonstrate that ARIA-LAA is a novel scheme of spectrum sharing with spatial reuse for LAA that can increase the overall system capacity while satisfying the fair-coexistence requirement. Its implementation is simple and robust as only a single design parameter is dynamically controlled and optimized for adaptation to the varying traffic load.	aria;channel capacity;coexist (image);compaq lte;mathematical model;simulation	Chan S.

In hybrid networks consisting of D2D and cellular links, finding the optimal interference management is challenging. In particular, we show that the problem of maximizing network throughput while guaranteeing predefined service levels to cellular users is non-convex and hence intractable. Instead, we adopt a distributed approach that is computationally extremely efficient, and requires minimal coordination, communication and cooperation among the nodes. The key algorithmic idea is a signaling mechanism that can be seen as a fictional pricing mechanism, that the base stations optimize and transmit to the D2D users, who then play a best response (i.e., selfishly) to this signal. Numerical results show that our algorithms converge quickly, have low overhead, and achieve a significant throughput gain, while maintaining the quality of cellular links at a predefined service level.	algorithm;converge;interference (communication);network performance;numerical linear algebra;overhead (computing);throughput	Qiaoyang Ye;Mazin Al-Shalash;Constantine Caramanis;Jeffrey G.

We propose a novel DC decomposition for the objective function and use DCA (DC algorithms) to solve this problem. The main advantage of the proposed DC decomposition is that it leads to strongly convex quadratic sub-problems that can be easily solved by both distributed and centralized methods. The numerical results show the efficiency of this DC decomposition compared with the one proposed in ([2]). The DC decomposition technique in this article may be applied for a wide range of multiuser DC problems in communication systems, signal processing and networking.

Savings in capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operational expenditures (OPEX) can be achieved in both the network deployment and network operation phase. Particularly, self-organized optimization of network coverage and network capacity is a key challenge to cope with the boost in mobile data traffic that is expected in the next years and to benefit from the growing market. We present a traffic-light-related approach to autonomous self-optimization of tradeoff performance indicators in LTE multitier networks. Introducing a low-complexity interference approximation model, the related optimization problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program and is embedded into a self-organized network operation and optimization framework. Tuning site activity, transmission power, and antenna downtilt are parameters of eNodeBs and Home eNodeBs. The optimization procedure is carried out considering time-variant optimization parameters that are automatically adapted with respect to changes in the network. Simulation-based evaluation of representative case studies demonstrates applicability and the benefit potential of our overall concept.	adaptive filter;algorithm;approximation;autonomous robot;cluster analysis;compaq lte;computation;computational complexity theory;elegant degradation;embedded system;emoticon;heuristic (computer science);interference (communication);java hotspot virtual machine;linear programming;mathematical optimization;multitier architecture;optimization problem;organizing (structure);program optimization;propagation constant;robustness (computer science);scalability;self-organization;simulation;social capital;software deployment;state space;telecommunications link;test case	Alexander Engels;Michael Reyer;Xiang Xu;Rudolf Mathar;Jietao Zhang;Hongcheng Zhuang	2013	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2013.2256441	simulation;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;resource management;capital expenditure;computer network	Mobile	25.228769718503884	92.08578834103834	81553

We propose a framework to analyze three facets of this idea: video distortion, transmit power, and delay. In the scenario considered here, both the transmitter and end-users are equipped with multi-antenna transceivers. The goal is to broadcast video to all users; however, the video is differentiated in quality to match the spatial and temporal variation of the channel. An emerging coding standard that is well-suited to this scenario is the Scalable Video Coding (SVC) extension of H.264. We employ the medium-grain scalability (MGS) feature of SVC, which allows us to generate quality-scalable layers from a single video sequence. For transport, the transmitter employs the block-diagonal zero-forcing (ZF) precoding technique, a well-known technique which yields good performance. With these assumptions, the idea here is to compute a precoder at fixed intervals. Crucially, the cross-layer framework allocates layers of video to the end-users jointly with precoder computation. The framework also ensures that delay and buffer constraints are met, which is necessary for real-time video. In terms of solution approach, the problem turns out to be a difficult mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problem. However, we show that it is tractable via a primal-dual method. We analyze performance in various configurations, gaining insight into the relationship between the main system parameters.	arithmetic underflow;cobham's thesis;column generation;computation;computational complexity theory;converge;data compression;distortion;encoder;forward error correction;greedy algorithm;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;mimo;mathematical optimization;multi-user;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;optimization problem;parsing;real-time clock;real-time transcription;scalability;scalable video coding;signal-to-noise ratio;transceiver;transmitter;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding	Jun Xu;Raju Hormis;Xiaodong Wang	2010	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2010.100416	scalable video coding;zero forcing equalizer;transmitter;telecommunications;nonlinear programming;computer science;block-matching algorithm;transmitter power output;motion compensation;precoding;encoding;computer network;transceiver;mimo	Vision	37.404493373489856	94.19223055848094	81625
5f36485c102f6f2e27a15eaa8db1550dde71bfc5	hierarchical beamforming in cran using random matrix theory		In this paper, we propose a hierarchical beamforming approach for the downlink of a multicellular multiuser system with cloud radio access network (CRAN) which requires reduced fronthaul transmissions while benefiting from the centralized functionality of the cloud. We design the hierarchical beamforming as a concatenation of two beamformers. The first one is called inner beamformer and it is designed at the base station (BS) based on the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) of its own users. For this beamformer, the BSs apply regularized zero-forcing (RZF). The second one is called outer beamformer and it is defined at the cloud based on the global but only statistical CSI. All outer beamformers are designed together at the cloud to allow coordination among the BSs. This hierarchical approach provides a combination of distributed and centralized precoding and so it manages the intra- cell as well as the inter-cell interference. Because the cloud has only statistical channel knowledge, we apply random matrix theory to obtain deterministic approximations of the useful power, intra-cell and inter-cell interference power at every user. These approximations are closed-form expressions and allow the cloud to optimize the outer beamformers for diverse objectives. In this work, we propose a low complexity iterative outer beamformer design based on block diagonalization which maximizes the system sum rate. Simulations show that the deterministic approximations are tight and that the proposed hierarchical beamforming achieves a higher sum rate compared to the conventional distributed RZF.	approximation;beamforming;centralized computing;channel state information;computer simulation;concatenation;interference (communication);iterative method;multi-user;radio access network;telecommunications link;zero-forcing precoding	Boriana Boiadjieva;Hussein Al-Shatri;Anja Klein	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2018.8422455	mathematical optimization;real-time computing;channel state information;precoding;telecommunications link;radio access network;beamforming;cloud computing;computer science;signal-to-noise ratio;communication channel	Mobile	32.09529504660418	90.30930833362613	81662

The objective is to maximize the sum rate subject to the secondary BS transmit power, minimum required rates for secondary users, and PUs’ interference power constraints. The utility function of interest is nonconcave and the involved constraints are nonconvex, so this problem is hard to solve. Nevertheless, we propose a new iterative algorithm that finds local optima at the least.

c2cd372ec9fae39bb94470af51870213c2f88b81	rank-constrained beamforming for mimo cognitive interference channel		This paper considers the spectrum sharing multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cognitive interference channel, in which multiple primary users (PUs) coexist with multiple secondary users (SUs). Interference alignment (IA) approach is introduced that guarantees that secondary users access the licensed spectrum without causing harmful interference to the PUs. A rank-constrained beamforming design is proposed where the rank of the interferences and the desired signals is concerned. The standard interferences metric for the primary link, that is, interference temperature, is investigated and redesigned. The work provides a further improvement that optimizes the dimension of the interferences in the cognitive interference channel, instead of the power of the interference leakage. Due to the nonconvexity of the rank, the developed optimization problems are further approximated as convex form and are solved via choosing the transmitter precoder and receiver subspace iteratively. Numerical results show that the proposed designs can improve the achievable degree of freedom (DoF) of the primary links and provide the considerable sum rate for both secondary and primary transmissions under the rank constraints.	beamforming;interference (communication);mimo	Duoying Zhang;Yao Zhang;Zujian Wu;Huiqin Du	2016	Mobile Information Systems	10.1155/2016/2152538	telecommunications	Mobile	38.25822898628388	89.97639398020291	81752

The considered SINR expressions naturally arise in relay-assisted systems. The energy efficiency is measured in bit/Joule and is defined as the ratio of a proper function of the SINR, divided by the consumed power. Unlike most previous related works, in the definition of the consumed power, not only the transmit power, but also the circuit power needed to operate the devices is accounted for. A non-cooperative game theoretic approach is employed and distributed power control algorithms are proposed. For both SINR expressions (a) and (b), it is shown that the competitive power allocation problem always admits a Nash equilibrium. Moreover, for the SINR (a), the equilibrium is also shown to be unique and the best-response dynamic is guaranteed to converge to such unique equilibrium. For the two-user case, the efficient computation of the Pareto frontier of the considered game is addressed, and, for benchmarking purposes, a social optimum solution with fairness constraint is derived.	catastrophic interference;computation;converge;emoticon;expectation–maximization algorithm;fairness measure;game theory;interference (communication);joule;nash equilibrium;pareto efficiency;relay;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio	Alessio Zappone;Zhijiat Chong;Eduard Axel Jorswieck;Stefano Buzzi	2013	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2013.031313.121103	games;game theory;mathematical optimization;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;transmitter;heterogeneous network;telecommunications;power transmission;power control;computer science;interference;efficient energy use;signal-to-noise ratio;nash equilibrium	Mobile	33.10996341730952	93.15107517470032	81836

The proposed algorithm first guarantees that the links between AP and client stations are robust to the inter-cell interference via TPC. Next, it minimizes contention between neighboring APs via DCA utilizing a novel metric and annealed Gibbs sampler. Through ns-3 simulations based on measurement in real office environments, we demonstrate that JACPoT reduces uplink frame collisions by 36% and significantly enhances both data and voice traffic delivery."""	algorithm;centralized computing;executable;gibbs sampling;ibm tivoli storage productivity center;interference (communication);radio resource management;sampling (signal processing);simulation;telecommunications link;wireless access point	Seongwon Kim;Yeonchul Shin;Seungmin Yoo;Sunghyun Choi	2014	2015 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7417222	real-time computing;telecommunications;power control;computer science;radio resource management;interference;wi-fi array;signal-to-noise ratio;measurement;computer network	Mobile	25.795737633317152	90.09007077733476	81846

To address this problem, this paper proposes a distributed power self-optimization scheme for the downlink of dense femtocell networks. First, a non-cooperative power self-optimization game framework is established based on the exact potential game, which is demonstrated to converge to a pure and unique Nash Equilibrium. Then, a novel convex pricing mechanism is presented to price the transmit power of femtocells. Finally, combined with Firefly Intelligence Optimization (FIO), an effective power self-optimization algorithm with guaranteed convergence is proposed to achieve the Nash Equilibrium. With practical LTE parameters and 3GPP dual-strip femtocell model, simulation results show that the proposed scheme dramatically reduce femtocells transmit power while improving the throughput of dense femtocell networks compared to the scheme with non-linear pricing.	algorithm;compaq lte;converge;firefly;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;nash equilibrium;nonlinear system;program optimization;simulation;software deployment;telecommunications link;throughput	Xidong Wang;Wei Zheng;Jingfang Liu;Wei Li;Xiangming Wen	2013	2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666457	pricing;game theory;mathematical optimization;simulation;telecommunications	Mobile	30.97502790256774	93.25809562978748	81877
80fa8fc1f8fbaf74f489137db6590c6aab026b4d	jamming partner selection for maximising the worst d2d secrecy rate based on social trust		Device-to-device (D2D) communications have recently attracted broad attention, owing to its potential ability to improve spectrum and energy efficiency within the existing cellular infrastructure. Without sophisticated control, D2D users themselves are not powerful enough to resist eavesdropping or fight against security attacks. This work investigates how to select jamming partners for D2D users to thwart eavesdroppers by exploiting social relationship with the help of full channel state information (CSI) and partial CSI, respectively. We aim to maximise the worst-case eavesdropping by selecting jammer node and allocating transmit power for both source and jammer nodes. We first present a heuristic genetic algorithm-based solution to address the problem. We then propose low-complexity optimisation solutions by considering the upper and lower bounds of power allocation. Numerical results show that the proposed schemes can achieve better performance through finding an appropriate partner.

In this contribution, we introduce an extension of the SeDJoCo problem and address its links to the field of Independent Vector Analysis (IVA) and to CBF in a multicast framework. A solution of the extended SeDJoCo problem is proposed by extending the LU decomposition-based concept that is frequently used for joint matrix diagonalization.

In this case, the users of different MVNOs, who have taken part in network sharing, can connect to the same radio access network (RAN). In the shared network, a certain available capacity of a MVNO depends on how much this MVNO pays. However, spectrum allocation among MVNOs only by this method is not reasonable, which will lead to unfair competition and reasonless utilization of radio resources, even waste. Though there have been some existing schemes to resolve this problem, they either don't make full use of spectrum or may destroy the basic interest of MVNOs. This paper discusses a new scheme(BMSN-OSS, Based Multi-operator Shared Network Opportunistic Spectrum Sharing) for how the radio resources may be allocated and shared among the MVNOs in such a multi-operator LTE network. This scheme can not only make the best of unoccupied spectrum reasonably, but also can guarantee all of the MVNOs' interest.	blocking (computing);compaq lte;erlang (unit);fairness measure;frequency allocation;open sound system;radio access network;service-level agreement;spectral efficiency;telecommunications network;traffic exchange	Peipei Wang;Ben Wang;Weidong Wang;Yinghai Zhang;Weidong Wang	2012	2012 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Cloud Computing and Intelligence Systems	10.1109/CCIS.2012.6664299	spectrum management;radio access network;cognitive radio;telecommunications;radio resource management;small cell;computer security;computer network;umts terrestrial radio access network	Mobile	26.115424144033657	93.11240518500462	82160

In the proposed scheme, according to frequency resource and time resource, layered coding and erasure-correction coding are adopted, respectively. Layered coding divides the data into base layer and enhancement layer, which transmits the data in different rates to maximize the system capacity; erasure-correction coding compensates for the possible packet loss due to instantaneous channel information. To complete subcarrier allocation and bit loading for the coding-based scheme, a practical algorithm is designed. As only the users' mean channel gains are required, the proposed scheme reduces the overheads required for instantaneous channel information and is suitable for a fast time-varying fading environment. Numerical results show that the coding-based scheme can get significant performance improvement compared with the scheme without coding.	algorithm;channel capacity;channel state information;multicast;network packet;scheduling (computing);subcarrier;throughput	Mingming Li;Xiaoxiang Wang;Hongtao Zhang;Mingwei Tang	2012	2012 IEEE 75th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VETECS.2012.6239867	real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;radio resource management;operating system;scheduling;encoding;computer network	Mobile	30.884844290430237	89.03748237171497	82398

Using the same spectrum as the macrocells, small cells would allow increased spatial reuse of bandwidth. In industrialized countries, the deployment of new small cells by another actor (tier) to cover the outage improves the service with a lower cost. In this paper, we investigate cell association issue in heterogeneous networks composed of small and macrocells operating in the same spectrum. In contrast to the related work, we consider that the small cells are a cellular network belonging to another tier. Hence, there is competitiveness between the two tiers in order to selfishly maximize the gain while respecting the User Equipment (UE) Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. We propose a model based on game theory in order to get the best distribution of user equipments among small and macro base stations.	game theory;interference (communication);multitier architecture;quality of service;requirement;software deployment;sun outage;throughput	Khaoula Dhifallah;Yvon Gourhant;Sidi-Mohammed Senouci	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2017.7996440	heterogeneous network;user equipment;software deployment;computer network;quality of service;macro;small cell;computer science;cellular network;base station	Mobile	25.842964011591096	89.4862253114248	82646
da6b0eb68d8f40df4f6697680ac5152dedc60502	energy efficiency maximization of full-duplex two-way relay-assisted device-to-device communications underlaying cellular networks	signal image and speech processing;information systems applications incl internet;communications engineering networks	With the substantial progress in self-interference (SI) cancelation, the full-duplex (FD) technique, which allows the communication user to transmit and receive signals over the same frequency band simultaneously, enables a significant enhancement of spectral efficiency (SE) in comparison with the traditional half-duplex (HD) technique. Recently, relay-assisted device-to-device (D2D) communications underlaying cellular networks have aroused a great deal of research interests due to its high SE. For the new meaningful paradigm of the combination of the FD and the amplify-and-forward (AF) relay-assisted D2D communications, analyzing the SE and energy efficiency (EE) is crucial, which have not been investigated in the existing works. In this paper, we focus on the EE of the FD twoway (FDTW) relay-assisted D2D communications with uplink channel reuse by considering the residual SI at the D2D users and compare it with the HD counterpart. Our goal is to find the optimal transmission powers and amplification gain to maximize the system EE while guaranteeing SE requirements and maximum transmission power constraints. A new two-tier alternative iteration optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem. Simulation results show that (1) the results obtained by the proposed algorithm is very close to those obtained by the exclusive searching method, (2) smaller residual power of SI leads to better performance of EE and SE, (3) the SE obtained by FDTW relay-assisted D2D networks is higher than the SE obtained by the HD counterpart, and (4) the EE comparison of FDTW relay-assisted D2D networks and its HD counterpart depends on the residual power of SI. The EE obtained by FDTW relay-assisted D2D is higher than the EE obtained by HD counterpart only when the residual power of SI is sufficiently small.	duplex (telecommunications);expectation–maximization algorithm;fd trinitron/wega;frequency band;interference (communication);iteration;mathematical optimization;multitier architecture;optimization problem;programming paradigm;relay;requirement;simulation;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link	Yiliang Chang;Hongbin Chen	2016	EURASIP J.

3203b3ff32521f6f5642cd4e68b20d3cdfa97f9c	a decomposition method for frequency assignment in multibeam satellite systems		As a result of the continually growing demand for multimedia content and higher throughputs in wireless communication systems, the telecommunication industry has to keep improving the use of the bandwidth resources. This access to the radiofrequency spectrum is both limited and expensive, which has naturally lead to the definition of the generic class of combinatorial optimization problems known as “Frequency Assignment Problems” (FAP). In this article, we present a new extension of these problems to the case of satellite systems that use a multibeam coverage. With the models we propose, we make sure that for each frequency plan produced there exists a corresponding satellite payload architecture that is cost-efficient and decently complex. Two approaches are presented and compared : a global constraint program that handles all the constraints simultaneously, and a decomposition method that involves both constraint programming and integer linear programming. For the latter approach where two subproblems are studied, we show that one of them can be modeled as a multiprocessor scheduling problem while the other can either be seen as a path-covering problem or a multidimensionnal bin-packing problem depending on the assumptions made. These analogies are used to prove that both the subproblems addressed in the decomposition method belong to the category of NP-hard problems. We also show that, for the most common class of interference graphs in multibeam satellite systems, the maximal cliques can all be enumerated in polynomial time and their number is relatively low, therefore it is perfectly acceptable to rely on them in the scheduling model that we derived. Our experiments on realistic scenarios show that the decomposition method proposed can indeed provide a solution of the problem when the global CP model does not.	algorithm;assignment problem;bin packing problem;clique (graph theory);combinatorial optimization;computation;constraint programming;cost efficiency;covering problems;experiment;face animation parameter;gurobi;integer programming;interference (communication);linear programming;mathematical optimization;maximal set;multiprocessing;multiprocessor scheduling;np-hardness;performance;radio frequency;scheduling (computing);set packing;solver;time complexity	Jean-Thomas Camino;Christian Artigues;Laurent Houssin;Stéphane Mourgues	2015			mathematical optimization;computer science;linear programming;mathematics;distributed computing;multiprocessor scheduling;algorithm	AI	31.382508319342243	99.05377676085529	82675

In this paper, a resource allocation scheme is developed for a downlink multi-user NOMA system. An optimization problem is formulated to maximize the sum rate under the total power and proportional rate constraints. Due to the complexity of computing the optimal solution, we develop a low complexity sub-optimal solution for a two-user scenario and then extend it to the multi-user case by proposing a user-pairing approach as well as a number of power allocation techniques that facilitate dealing with a large number of users in NOMA system. Simulation results support the effectiveness of the proposed approaches and show the close performance to the optimal one. In addition, we propose a new hybrid multiple access technique that combines the properties of NOMA and the orthogonal frequency division multiple access. Simulation results show that the proposed hybrid method provides better performance than NOMA in terms of the overall achievable sum rate and the coverage probability.	frequency divider;mathematical optimization;multi-user;optimization problem;scenario (computing);simulation;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link	Ziad Qais Al-Abbasi;Daniel K.

4e5641ec0fe3b66ba573f2e52f1c7005b3698d81	on linear precoding for the two-user miso broadcast channel with confidential messages and per-antenna constraints		We study the design of linear precoders for secure transmission in the two-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast channel with confidential messages (BC-CM). The transmitter has multiple antennas, and each user has a single receive antenna. Two independent messages are simultaneously transmitted, one intended for each user, and each message should be kept confidential from the other user. Assuming real-valued transmitted signals, we design the linear precoders subject to total and per-antenna average power constraints, and also subject to amplitude constraints. In both cases, we tackle the design problem via weighted secrecy sum rate maximization. The resulting problem, however, involves a fractional objective, making it nonconvex and difficult to solve. Nevertheless, we show that this difficult problem can be transformed into a more tractable problem, for which a solution can be obtained by an iterative search algorithm. In addition, we characterize a condition under which the obtained solution is guaranteed to be optimal. Furthermore, we show that the problem formulation and solution approach can be easily extended to handle the robust version of the design problem with uncertain channel information. We provide numerical examples to demonstrate the performance of the proposed precoder in terms of the achievable secrecy rate regions subject to the aforementioned constraints. We also demonstrate the performance of the robust precoder under different channel uncertainty levels.	brute-force search;cobham's thesis;concave function;confidentiality;deferred procedure call;entropy maximization;iterative method;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimization problem;quasiconvex function;reflections of signals on conducting lines;search algorithm;secure transmission;signal-to-noise ratio;social inequality;subderivative;subgradient method;system analysis;transmitter	Ayman Mostafa;Lutz H.-J.

c7225edafcd7b60654c62b852e8e3ac0b37c7053	outage-constrained secure d2d underlay communication with arbitrarily distributed csi uncertainty		This paper considers a cellular multiple-input single- output (MISO) system overheard by multiple eavesdroppers, in the presence of one pair of single- antenna device-to-device (D2D) nodes working as an underlay. The D2D nodes are permitted to access the cellular channel for their own communications. We assume that the channel state information (CSI) on all links is imperfect, and more specifically, the CSI error follows an arbitrary distribution with only the first and second moments available at the transmitter. Our goal is to design the covariances of confidential message and artificial noise, as well as the transmit power at the D2D transmitter, such that the total consumed power is minimized subject to a sequence of worst-case outage constraints on the received signal- to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at each receiver. The worst-case outage constraints are imposed to satisfy SINR outage requirement under arbitrarily distributed CSI uncertainty. The resulting problem is challenging to solve due to its inherently complex structure. However, we reveal its hidden convexity by carrying out a duality-based reformulation. Then it is proved that the proposed method always yield a single- stream beamforming solution. The complexity analysis of our proposed method is also presented. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed design is demonstrated by simulations.	analysis of algorithms;beamforming;best, worst and average case;channel state information;confidentiality;downtime;interference (communication);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;system analysis;transmitter	Weidong Mei;Zhi Chen;Jun Fang	2017	GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254009	computer network;channel state information;transmitter power output;topology;computer science;underlay;beamforming;transmitter;artificial noise;communication channel;signal-to-noise ratio	Mobile	37.45751846269298	89.62276132046767	82875

In order to reduce the energy consumption of a FiWi enhanced LTE-A HetNet, we should offload the traffic of lightly loaded BSs to other active BSs and turn them into sleep state, while in order to provide stable service to more user equipments (UEs), we should put as many BSs into active state as possible. Obviously, there is a trade-off between minimizing the energy consumption and maximizing the number of UEs associated with the BSs. However, previous research works either focused on energy consumption minimization or placed emphasis on UE connection maximization, and few of them integrate these two parts together and give an optimal solution. Toward this end, this article studies the issues in energy consumption minimization with the UE connection constraint in FiWi enhanced LTE-A HetNets, and propose a heuristic greedy solution to find an optimal list of active BSs and their associated UEs.	backhaul (telecommunications);compaq lte;expectation–maximization algorithm;greedy algorithm;heuristic;optical fiber;radio access network;user experience	Jiajia Liu;Hongzhi Guo;Zubair Md.

dc5e724a9378bd753b9ab5637a9bf9a8fd7800d6	throughput maximization for wireless powered non-orthogonal multiple access networks with multiple antennas		The non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique can provide higher spectral efficiency and massive connectivities to wireless networks. The wireless power transfer (WPT) technique is a controllable and promising way to solve the energy scarcity problem of wireless devices. In this paper, we introduce the NOMA and WPT techniques into a multi-user wireless network, where multiple users need to transmit their information to an information receiver within a very limited spectrum and they suffer from the energy scarcity problem. We consider a harvest-then-transmit protocol by dividing each transmission block into two time-slots. In the first time-slot, a power station sends dedicated energy to the users via wireless energy beamforming. In the second time-slot, using their harvested energy in the previous time-slot, the users transmit their information to the information receiver in the NOMA manner. In this network, the throughput can be optimized by jointly optimizing the energy beamforming at the power station, the transmit powers of the users, as well as the time allocation between the two time-slots. We propose an algorithm to find the optimal solution of the throughput maximizing joint energy beamforming and resource allocation problem. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves higher throughput than the benchmark scheme.	access network;beamforming;benchmark (computing);expectation–maximization algorithm;multi-user;simulation;spectral efficiency;throughput	Haoran Pang;Guangchi Zhang;Qingqing Wu;Miao Cui	2017	2017 23rd Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC)	10.23919/APCC.2017.8304022	real-time computing;computer science;wireless network;computer network;throughput;wireless;beamforming;wireless power transfer;spectral efficiency;resource allocation;access network	Mobile	31.37254836339978	91.16394960944902	83200

The OFDMA-based channel-width adaptation based on traffic demand has been studied in wireless networks with sufficient spectral resources. However, the traffic demand may not be fully satisfied in resource-limited scenarios. In this paper, we study the channel-width adaptation problem in wireless mesh networks (WMNs) with limited spectral resources. More specifically, considering diverse quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, a QoS-aware channel-width adaptation scheme is proposed. First, resource allocation with QoS-aware channel-width adaptation is modelled as an optimization problem. Genetic algorithm is employed to get a near-optimal solution. Then, in order to reduce the computational complexity, a greedy algorithm is developed to suit the highly dynamic traffic demand. Simulation results show that the proposed low-complexity algorithm can guarantee the QoS support in resource-limited scenarios.	benchmark (computing);computational complexity theory;genetic algorithm;greedy algorithm;mathematical optimization;mesh networking;optimization problem;quality of service;requirement;simulation;software release life cycle;wireless mesh network	Hao Li;Jiliang Zhang;Qi Hong;Hui Zheng;Yang Wang;Jie Zhang	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2016.7511082	wireless mesh network;genetic algorithm;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;resource management;wireless network;distributed computing;interference;computer network	Robotics	28.250878868407185	93.04004193848486	83401

Scalable Video Coding (SVC) is efficient for rate adaptation and unequal protection in wireless networks where heterogeneous mobile clients have different hardware specifications and time-varying channel conditions. Using the scalability characteristics of SVC, we propose a general approach to ensure fairness for multiple scalable video downlink from a multiple-antenna base station. The fairness is achieved by packet priority analysis referring to layer dependency from application layer and a MAXMIN resource allocation at the physical layer. Based on packet priorities, time-frequency resource, power and modulation schemes are adaptively selected for transmission. This scheme significantly improves the overall system performance and guarantee fairness among users, as demonstrated by experimental comparisons with conventional radio resource allocation schemes.	fairness measure;mimo-ofdm;minimax;modulation;multi-user mimo;multiplexing;network packet;scalability;scalable video coding;standard database management analysis;telecommunications link	Maodong Li;Zhenzhong Chen;Yap-Peng Tan	2011	2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5938148	fairness measure;real-time computing;time–frequency analysis;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;max-min fairness;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;computer network	Embedded	30.63864090975571	89.16416790941118	83799
125a3a6d04519bdc86ae8eee0fcda94a5de21c8b	an efficient hybrid spectrum access algorithm in ofdm-based wideband cognitive radio networks	selection;hybrid access strategy;wideband spectrum sensing;throughput maximization;cognitive radio networks	In cognitive radio networks, wideband spectrum sensing is a promising technology which allows a secondary user (SU) to detect the signals of primary users (PUs) over multiple channels, the sensing overhead is reduced effectively. Together with spectrum sensing, spectrum access strategy affects the system performance. In this paper, we propose an efficient hybrid access algorithm in OFDM-based wideband uplink model. An SU senses multiple channels via wideband spectrum sensing, and accesses these channels via a hybrid access strategy. The sensing time and transmission power of each channel are jointly optimized, in order to maximize the ergodic throughput of SUs, while the interferences to PUs are under the predefined thresholds. It is shown that the optimization problem can be formulated as a convex problem. Moreover, in order to reduce the computational complexity, two low complexity spectrum sensing and access schemes are proposed, in which the SU selects several specific channels to sense, and accesses all channels via a modified hybrid access strategy. For sensing channels selection, we present an effective selection criterion and an optimal selection order. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the system performance.	algorithm;cognitive radio	Chao Yang;Yuli Fu;Yan Zhang;Yi Liu	2014	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2012.07.041	selection;cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science	Mobile	33.35343075728155	89.92415026861053	83900

How to choose the subset of the original constellation phasers appears to be challenging and interesting to the researchers. There hardly exists any literature which studies the feasibility and the solution of constellation subset selection in details. Here we dedicate to this problem in both theoretical exploration and algorithm design. In this paper, we introduce the detailed theoretical analysis regarding the mathematical properties of the commonly-used constellations and then facilitate the constellation subset selection problem. The CSS problem can be formulated as the maximization of the minimum inter-phaser distance within a constellation subset subject to the symmetry and rate constraints. Based on our problem formulation, we design two algorithms to solve this problem thereby. Our complexity analysis evinces the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.	algorithm design;analysis of algorithms;cascading style sheets;expectation–maximization algorithm;modulation;selection algorithm;sun constellation system	Hsiao-Chun Wu;Shih Yu Chang	2010	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2010.07.090500	algorithm design;feasibility study;mathematical optimization;telecommunications;computer science;machine learning;mathematics;subset sum problem	Vision	39.1512454173735	89.58939305651195	84087

In this paper, we propose an interference control scheme that allows multiple secondary systems to maintain their aggregate interference at the TV receivers under specific protection limits. The main characteristic of the proposed scheme is the small signaling overhead required for the cooperation between the secondary systems. The secondary systems need only to communicate their locations to a central network controller. The controller can then allocate the transmission power levels to the different systems such that the TV receivers are sufficiently protected. At the same time, the sum of the transmission power levels allocated to the secondary systems is maximized.	aggregate data;centralized computing;interference (communication);network interface controller;overhead (computing);software deployment;white spaces (radio)	Konstantinos Koufos;Kalle Ruttik;Riku Jäntti	2011	2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140042	transmitter;multi-band device;telecommunications;power control;computer science;interference;fading	Arch	31.351203286914764	89.39951639612751	84465

In this paper, we propose a novel teletraffic-based approach to save power consumption of a three-cell microcellular network. When the traffic load in the middle cell is lower than certain threshold, the cell can be switched-off and its users will be covered by increasing the transmission power of one sector antenna in each of the two neighboring cells. Numerical results demonstrate that at a moderate cost of increased antenna transmission power of the two sectors, significant amount of network power can be saved for the whole network.	mathematical optimization;maximum power transfer theorem;mobile device;multitier architecture;requirement;simulation	Ziaul Haq Abbas;Frank Yong Li	2011	2011 IEEE 36th Conference on Local Computer Networks	10.1109/LCN.2011.6115535	cellular network;mobile telephony;telecommunications;hysteresis;network switch;computer science;operating system;mobile device;signal-to-noise ratio;computer network	Mobile	25.078985655119983	90.59163935987753	84523

However, choosing appropriate relay nodes is critical to maximize the overall network performance. In this paper, we consider the assignment problem of relay nodes in a cooperative wireless network, where physical relay infrastructures and relay supporting services (relay assignment) are independently operated by different selfish entities with each being driven by its own benefit. We first formulate the problem as a repeated double auction by taking into account the benefits of all entities. Specifically, we consider a system that consists of a set of source-to-destination pairs, where the source nodes are grouped into groups and each of them is represented by a group agent. We assume that both the source nodes and the group agents seek opportunities to maximize their own benefits through various means including untruthful bidding and collusion with each other, and so on. To maximize the social benefit of the system that include the benefits of the source nodes, the relay nodes and the auctioneer, we devise an auction which we refer it to as the repeated multi-heterogeneous-item double auction with collusion resistance. We also analytically show that this auction is not only truthful but also collusion resistant. The experimental results indicate that the proposed auction is effective in collusion-resistance.	assignment problem;auction algorithm;channel capacity;entity;experiment;network performance;rationality;real-time bidding;relay;remote database access;simulation;software deployment	Zichuan Xu;Weifa Liang	2012	2012 IEEE 9th International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems (MASS 2012)	10.1109/MASS.2012.6502545	telecommunications;computer science;sensor;double auction;network performance;relay channel;computer security;computer network	Mobile	32.148856446414854	94.71367578223985	84861

Two main considerations in designing such a system are algorithms for the selection of coding and modulation schemes based on the channel quality of the link and algorithms for the selection of the user to whom a particular slot is assigned. We propose a systematic approach to optimize the mapping between signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) and modulation and coding scheme (MCS) to maximize the throughput by taking into account the type of HARQ scheme employed. We also propose to incorporate frame error rate (FER) and retransmission information as a part of the scheduling decision. The proposed scheduler ranking methods based on using an effective rate rather than the instantaneous rate provide natural priority to retransmissions over new transmissions, and priority to users with better channel quality. Extensive simulation results comparing performance of the proposed methods to conventional methods are presented.	adaptive coding;algorithm;channel state information;computation;data system;hybrid automatic repeat request;interference (communication);modulation;multi categories security;network packet;optimizing compiler;proportionally fair;retransmission (data networks);scheduling (computing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;telecommunications link;throughput	Haitao Zheng;Harish Viswanathan	2005	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2004.843012	link adaptation;telecommunications;computer science;adaptive system;wireless;statistics;computer network	Mobile	33.46410607393959	89.14467688533652	84970

For a multiple primary channels (PCs) scenario, the SUs are generally allowed to utilize all the idle PCs in order to maximize the system throughput. In the conventional approach, the SUs sense all the PCs to maximize the number of channels available for data transmission. However, the increase in the number of PCs sensed by the CR network will increase the time consumption in the sensing phase, and thus degrades the time available for data transmission. The goal of this work is to find the pre-determined optimal number of channels utilized for data transmission to maximize the system throughput. Compared to the real-time adaptation approach, our proposed scheme can be easily applied to practical systems and achieve a throughput very close to the ultimate system throughput, but without the need of real-time computation burden.	cognitive radio;computation;computational complexity theory;expectation–maximization algorithm;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;real-time clock;throughput;transmitter	Yuh-Ren Tsai;Yung-Cheng Chao	2012	2012 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2012.6503303	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer network	Embedded	27.381873495627133	97.09163049273229	85006

We test the proposed scheme on a realistic scenario using a practical low complexity channel predictor, suitable for implementation at the mobile stations. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms previous prediction-based RA strategies without prediction error characterization, and the system throughput is comparable to the case with perfect channel state information in the transmitter.	algorithm;channel state information;kerrison predictor;mobile phone;simulation;telecommunications link;throughput;traffic collision avoidance system;transmitter	Jorge F.

With the combination of the min-max criterion and the VNS-based algorithm, both the optimal gain of each subchannel and the uplink effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) can be obtained simultaneously. By minimizing the maximum of carrier powers output from the satellite transponder, the proposed criterion aims at reducing the difference among carrier powers in the satellite transponder as much as possible to avoid carrier power being irregular so that we can optimally set the transponder's operating point to improve the transponder power utility, and minimize each terminal's uplink EIRP so that as many links as possible could be supported and thus the system capacity could be enhanced. Furthermore, this proposed approach is generalized to analyze the capacity of classical transponder systems. Practical examples are also presented to verify the proposed approach's superior performance in improving a digital channelized SATCOM system's capacity.	aggregate data;algorithm;channel capacity;channelization (telecommunications);communications satellite;digital subchannel;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;multistage interconnection networks;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;operating point;simulation;telecommunications link;transponder;variable neighborhood search;zero suppression	Zhiming Yang;Zhigang Cao	2012	IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems	10.1109/TAES.2012.6237618	electronic engineering;telecommunications;noise;electrical engineering;transponder;interference;earth;channel capacity;communications satellite;physics;satellite	EDA	39.02025689326283	90.84456154706308	85040

There are two major directions for the spectrum allocation: licensed (e.g., 4G cellular service) and unlicensed services (e.g., Super Wi-Fi service). The 4G service provides a ubiquitous coverage, has a higher spectrum efficiency, and often charges users a high service price. The Super Wi-Fi service has a limited coverage, a lower spectrum efficiency, but often charges users a low service price. The spectrum regulator now simply allocates the spectrum to maximize its income, but such an income-centric allocation does not ensure the best spectrum utilization by the users. This motivates us to design a new spectrum allocation scheme which jointly considers the spectrum regulator's income and the users' aggregate utility by investigating three market tiers: the spectrum regulator, 4G and Super Wi-Fi operator coalitions, and all the wireless users. We formulate it as a three-stage game and derive the unique subgame perfect equilibrium. Compared with the traditional income-centric allocation, we prove that the proposed scheme significantly improves users' aggregate utility with a limited spectrum regulator's income loss.	aggregate data;frequency allocation;spectral efficiency	Yanjiao Chen;Lingjie Duan;Jianwei Huang;Qian Zhang	2015	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2015.2393309	spectrum management;games;game theory;frequency allocation;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;wireless network;computer security;wireless;computer network;bandwidth allocation	Mobile	29.746204229322075	95.48957913788554	85150

The base station (BS) unicasts or multicasts the content to selected MTs that, in turn, either unicast or multicast it to other MTs, forming a multihop ad hoc network with a predefined maximum allowed number of hops. This paper presents the optimization formulations whose solution gives the exact optimal set of receiving MTs from the BS, the optimal multihop ad hoc network, and the optimal unicasting and multicasting transmission bit rates that minimize the total energy consumption of the MTs. Second, a simplified multicasting formulation is proposed that has a close-to-optimal performance with notably lower computational complexity. Third, interference avoidance among the transmitting MTs is considered. For each presented formulation, the complexity is identified, and results show that some formulations can be efficiently solved for medium network sizes, while others are more computationally complex. Thus, polynomial-time heuristic solutions are presented that have close-to-optimal performance. Results demonstrate remarkable energy consumption reduction gains and wireless resources savings under various network scenarios.	computational complexity theory;download;heuristic;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);mathematical optimization;multicast;open content;time complexity;transmitter;unicast	Lina Al-Kanj;Zaher Dawy	2015	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2014.2352355	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;transmission;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;interference;spread spectrum;wireless;computer network	Mobile	29.87324921282669	92.71696283010003	85224

We demonstrate that the precoding in beam domain is optimal when different users transmit data in non-overlapping beams. To satisfy the condition of optimality, a greedy algorithm with low complexity is proposed to select users and allocate beams for transmission based on statistical channel state information (CSI) by maximizing the deterministic equivalent approximation of the average sum rate.

Based on the channel quality indicator (CQI), feedback rate for each MS is determined exploiting the signaling of MAC layer automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocol, users application and mobility profile. More specifically, DCRA first derives the optimal average feedback window values based on the user velocity and service class for a target packet error rate. Using this information, DCRA can then allocate the CQI resource dynamically on frame-by-frame basis. Simulations comparing our approach to an exiting Doppler based mechanism show that DCRA reduces the feedback overhead significantly while maintaining the application QoS constraints.	algorithm;automatic repeat request;bit error rate;computer simulation;doppler effect;multi-user;network packet;overhead (computing);quality of service;telecommunications link;velocity (software development);window function	Mohammad Abdul Awal;Lila Boukhatem	2011	2011 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2011.5779132	real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;quality of service;bit error rate;doppler effect;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;base station;resource management;mobile station;automatic repeat request;signal-to-noise ratio;computer network	Embedded	30.292892143317687	89.17545761939688	85590

A heuristic algorithm based on the semidefinite relaxation is then developed to obtain antenna array excitation weights with low computational complexity. Simulation results show that the performance of our algorithm is superior to that of antenna downtilt optimization algorithm.	algorithm;beamforming;computation;computational complexity theory;heuristic (computer science);lagrangian relaxation;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;program optimization;simulation	Dongdong Fan;Zhouyun Wu;Aiping Huang;Hongcheng Zhuang;Tony Q.

However, due to the instable energy supply and the limited battery capacity, renewable energy cannot guarantee to provide the perpetual operation for wireless sensor networks (WSN). The coexistence of renewable energy and electricity grid is expected as a promising energy supply manner to remain function of WSN for a potentially infinite lifetime. In this paper, we propose a new system model suitable for WSN, taking into account multiple energy consumptions due to sensing, transmission and reception, heterogeneous energy supplies from renewable energy, electricity grid and mixed energy, and multi-dimension stochastic natures due to energy harvesting profile, electricity price and channel condition. A discrete-time stochastic cross-layer optimization problem is formulated to achieve the optimal trade-off between the time-average rate utility and electricity cost subject to the data and energy queuing stability constraints. The Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty with perturbation technique and block coordinate descent method is applied to obtain a fully distributed and low-complexity cross-layer algorithm only requiring knowledge of the instantaneous system state. The explicit trade-off between the optimization objective and queue backlog is theoretically proven. Finally, through extensive simulations, the theoretic claims are verified, and the impacts of a variety of system parameters on overall objective, rate utility and electricity cost are investigated.	algorithm;coexist (image);coordinate descent;drift plus penalty;lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;program optimization;simulation;theory	Weiqiang Xu;Yushu Zhang;Qingjiang Shi;Xiaodong Wang	2015	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2015.2394799	mathematical optimization;telecommunications;computer science;electricity;stand-alone power system;radio frequency	Mobile	30.900359095499624	90.37005138287414	86118

Different from previous works, the price per resource unit is defined on a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) scale and users bid for the resources that maximize their own utility function.

Considering the selfish nature of the femtocell, how to provide enough incentives to the femtocell base station (FBS) for sharing its resources with the FURUs is challenging. Different from the previous works in this area, we adopt the Stackelberg-game modeling to represent the competition behaviors of the FBS and the users. Specifically, the proposed framework has the FBS to allocate resources to the FURUs through pricing while maintaining the quality of service (QoS) of the FRUs, which is done via the optimal solutions of the maximization of the utility functions of the buyers and the revenue of the seller. Simulation results show that upon the QoS of the FRUs are protected, the FBS dynamically determines the list of the accessible FURUs according to the assigned gain to the FURUs and the change of the FRUs' QoS demands.	access control;expectation–maximization algorithm;function-behaviour-structure ontology;multi-user;quality of service;registered user;simulation	Chengyi Liu;Song Xing;Lianfeng Shen	2015	2015 IEEE 26th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2015.7343472	computer simulation;database index;random variable;quality of service;computer science;yttrium;computer security;statistics;computer network	Arch	30.862566489574174	94.87492976178983	86521

The proposed sub-carrier allocation algorithm utilizes the baseband resource pool of C-RAN to achieve the centralized allocation of sub-carriers. In order to reduce the interference of edge users that share the same sub-carrier, and enhance the sys- tem throughput, the most shared sub-carriers are allocated to the user of central cell. The system throughput can be improved at the sacrifice of fairness decrement.

Considering the computational complexity of designing coordinated beamformers for dense networks, low-complexity and suboptimal precoding strategies are often adopted. However, it is not clear how much performance loss will be caused. To enable optimal coordinated beamforming, in this paper, we propose a framework to design a scalable beamforming algorithm based on the alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Specifically, we first propose to apply the matrix stuffing technique to transform the original optimization problem to an equivalent ADMM-compliant problem, which is much more efficient than the widely-used modeling framework CVX. We will then propose to use the ADMM algorithm, a.k.a. the operator splitting method, to solve the transformed ADMM-compliant problem efficiently. In particular, the subproblems of the ADMM algorithm at each iteration can be solved with closed-forms and in parallel. Simulation results show that the proposed techniques can result in significant computational efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art interior-point solvers. Furthermore, the simulation results demonstrate that the optimal coordinated beamforming can significantly improve the system performance compared to sub-optimal zero forcing beamforming.	algorithm;beamforming;computation;computational complexity theory;cooperative multitasking;iteration;list of operator splitting topics;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;scalability;simulation;software deployment;the matrix;throughput;wireless access point	Yuanming Shi;Jun Zhang;Khaled Ben Letaief	2014	2014 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7037367	algorithm design;mathematical optimization;computer science;theoretical computer science;computational complexity theory;wireless	Mobile	39.11092931162798	91.66002808154148	86857

Based on game theory, we propose an auction framework, where the parent MR serves as the auctioneer while its children MRs act as bidders and compete for time-slots. We derive a payment function from radio resource used for relaying traffic instead of money, so as to simplify the implementation and avoid the possible security problems from monetary payment. We prove the existence and uniqueness of Nash Equilibrium and propose a stochastic best response updating algorithm to allow the bids to iteratively converge to NE in a practical distributed fashion.

38b9e22b2a091c1eac8de9b80a3d5f1611a931fa	quantified spectrum sharing: motivation, approach, and benefits		A significant portion of the radio frequency spectrum remains underutilized with exclusive and static allocation of spectrum. The growing demand for spectrum has spurred a need for dynamic spectrum sharing paradigm. While the new dynamic spectrum sharing paradigm helps to improve utilization of the precious spectrum resource, there exist several obstacles on the technical, regulatory, and business fronts for the adoption of the new paradigm. In this paper, we investigate the limitations of the existing techniques and argue for quantified approach to dynamic spectrum sharing and management. We introduce a quantified approach to spectrum sharing based on defining and enforcing quantified spectrum-access rights. By discretizing the spectrumspace in the time, space, frequency dimensions, this approach enables quantifying the spectrum consumed by individual transceivers. It enables defining and enforcing a quantified spectrum-access policy in realtime. The proposed quantified approach brings in simplicity, precision and efficiency in terms of spectrum commerce and operations while addressing the key technical and regulatory challenges.	access control;discretization;existential quantification;frequency allocation;interference (communication);logical equality;programming paradigm;radio frequency;real-time transcription;routing;spectral density;transceiver;transmitter	Nilesh Khambekar;Chad M.

By treating the multi-cell multi-user resource allocation as resource partitioning among multiple r use patterns, we propose a unified framework to analyze and compare a wide r ange of user association and resource allocation strategies for HetNets, and provid e a benchmark of ultimate limit on network performance. The enabling mechanisms are a novel formulati on to considerall possible patterns or any pre-defined subset of patterns and an efficient sparsity-pur suit algorithm. More importantly, in view of the fact that multi-cell resource allocation is very comput ational demanding, our framework provides a systematic way to trade off performance for the reduction of computational complexity by restricting the candidate patterns to a small number of featurepatterns. Relying on the sparsity-pursuit capability of the proposed algorithm, we develop practical guideline t o identify the feature patterns in the given HetNet. Our treatment is very general in that it covers the ca se where users are allowed to associate with multiple base stations and the more restrictive situation w here the number of serving base stations for each user is limited to one or a given number. Numerical resul ts how that the identified feature patterns can significantly improve the existing strategies, and join tly optimizing the user association and resource allocation indeed brings considerable gain.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);computational complexity theory;genera;multi-user;network performance;numerical method;semantic network;sparse matrix;unified framework	Quan Kuang;Wolfgang Utschick;Andreas Dotzler	2014	CoRR		simulation;computer science;data mining	AI	29.9989920303249	91.92428655282076	87443

CPS is typically designed as a networked system of interacting sensors, actuators, and embedded computing devices to monitor and control the physical world. Thus, one of the essential building blocks of such a system is a highly efficient networking infrastructure. In this paper, we aims to develop an efficient wireless networking technology which can be utilized in CPS. More specifically, we develop a cross-layer optimization model based on the Network Utility Maximization (NUM) framework and its distributed solution for wireless multihop multicast networks exploiting multi-user diversity. It is known that the capacity of a wireless network can be increased by exploiting different channel conditions at different users, i.e., multi-user diversity; however, it is yet to be determined how much performance gain can be achieved by exploiting multi-user diversity in wireless multihop multicast networks. To address this problem, we extend the NUM framework and derive a new optimization problem including the benefits of multi-user diversity for multicasting scenarios in wireless multihop networks under a probabilistic media access control (MAC). In our problem, multi-user diversity is achieved via opportunistic scheduling. Then, we propose a distributed approximation algorithm for the problem. Our numerical results confirm that the benefit of multi-user diversity is prominent in a wireless multihop network with multicast flows.	access control;approximation algorithm;computation;crew scheduling;cyber-physical system;embedded system;expectation–maximization algorithm;interaction;linear network coding;mathematical optimization;multi-user;multicast;network utility;numerical analysis;optimization problem;scheduling (computing);sensor;simulation	Wooseong Kim;Joon-Sang Park;Sanghyun Ahn	2013	The Journal of Supercomputing	10.1007/s11227-013-0929-4	multicast;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;cooperative diversity;wi-fi array;computer network	Mobile	32.05766247300266	88.77702739356822	87464

However, most previous works on PF only consider the single cell scenario. This paper focuses on the problem of achieving global PF in a generalized multiple base station multiple user network. The problem is formulated as a maximization model and solved using dual method. By decomposing the dual objective function, we get a pricing based PF algorithm. Optimality of this algorithm is presented. Although the algorithm is derived using fixed link rate assumption, it can still achieve network wide PF in the presence of time varying rates. We show that the proposed algorithm is suitable for distributed systems in the sense that it does not need any inter base station communication at all. Simulations illustrate that compared with traditional local PF scheduling, global PF scheduling achieves higher throughput, lower throughput oscillation and greater fairness.	computation;computer simulation;distributed computing;dynamic graphics project;expectation–maximization algorithm;fairness measure;loss function;optimization problem;pf (firewall);proportionally fair;scheduling (computing);throughput	Hui Zhou;Pingyi Fan;Xiang-Gen Xia;Khaled Ben Letaief	2010	2010 IEEE Wireless Communication and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2010.5506472	fairness measure;real-time computing;simulation;computer science;base station;operating system;maximum throughput scheduling;computer network	Robotics	31.913724945070772	93.08590709355715	87684

We focus on the problem of maximizing the overall spectral efficiency while maintaining the QoS requirements of users, including bit error rate and individual minimum rate requirements. Under the assumption of equal power allocation, an efficient algorithm is proposed to obtain the suboptimal solution of the resource allocation. In this algorithm, we first introduce some positive multipliers, one for each user, according to their minimum rate constraints (MRC), and then a parallel subcarrier-and-bit allocation scheme is designed using these multipliers with low complexity. The numerical results show that our algorithm not only substantially reduces the computational complexity of the existing algorithm, but also provides a noticeable performance improvement.	algorithm;bisection method;bit error rate;computational complexity theory;multi-user;numerical analysis;numerical method;requirement;spectral efficiency;subcarrier;telecommunications link;vergence;x.690	Wei Xu;Chunming Zhao;Peng Zhou;Yijin Yang	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2007.847	real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;quality of service;bit error rate;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;computational complexity theory;wireless;spectral efficiency;computer network	Robotics	33.83478081228712	90.65764570524283	87692

An important issue is the interference leaked to the primary users (PUs) resulting from the transmission between the SN base station and the secondary users (SUs). Our aim is to provide the SUs with a minimum acceptable quality-of-service (QoS), while keeping the interference to the PUs below a given threshold. Previous solutions for this scenario involve several coarse approximations. Here we avoid these approximations and obtain an exact reformulation of the worst-case problem using Lagrange duality. Finally, we use semideﬁnite relaxation (SDR) to convert the resulting problem to a convex form. Computer simulations show that the SDR step does not involve any approximation as the resulting solution is always rank-one.	approximation;beamforming;best, worst and average case;cognitive radio;duality (optimization);etsi satellite digital radio;interference (communication);lagrange multiplier;linear programming relaxation;quality of service;simulation;telecommunications link	Imran Wajid;Marius Pesavento;Yonina C.

From the three optimizations, we propose an optimal maximum throughput approach and a suboptimal zero-forcing (ZF)-RBF-based approach. The time slot is divided into two phases: The first phase is for energy transfer in downlink, and the second phase is for space-division multiple access in uplink. The optimal approach relies on iterations, whereas the ZF-RBF approach does not require any iterations for simple implementation. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes offer spatial multiplexing gain for a wide range of path-loss exponent and harvested energy level, with the ZF-RBF approach exhibiting a limitation when the harvested energy level is low.	beamforming;energy level;expectation–maximization algorithm;iteration;mimo-ofdm;mathematical optimization;maximum throughput scheduling;multi-user mimo;radial basis function network;simulation;spatial multiplexing gain;telecommunications link;telecommunications network;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding	Duckdong Hwang;Dong In Kim;Tae-Jin Lee	2016	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2015.2453206	throughput;electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;antenna;iterative method;multiplexing	Visualization	35.39603165491037	89.6643364072459	87770

Links can interfere with each other due to their proximity and transmission power if they use the same frequency channel. Given that a frequency channel is the most important and scarce resource in a wireless network, we wish to minimize the total number of different frequency channels used. We can assign the same channel to multiple different links if the assignment is done in a way that avoids co-channel interference. Given a conflict graph which shows conflicts between pairs of links if they are assigned the same frequency channel, assigning channels to links can be cast as a minimum coloring problem. However the coloring problem is complicated by the fact that acceptably small levels of interference between pairs of links using the same channel can accumulate to cause an unacceptable level of total interference at a given link. In this paper we develop fast and effective methods for frequency channel assignment in multi-hop wireless networks via new heuristics for solving this extended coloring problem. The heuristics are orders of magnitude faster than an exact solution method while consistently returning near-optimum results.	assignment problem;channel (communications);heuristic (computer science)	Aizaz U.

It is able to avoid the widely used “quiet periods,” which have at least the following two disadvantages. First, periodical interruption of the secondary transmissions will degrade the QoS of secondary networks (e.g., decreased system capacity, increased packet delay, etc.). Second, tight synchronization becomes necessary but very difficult to implement in the distributed networks. With the assistance of geolocations of the primary transmitters and the secondary users, the proposed method is able to differentiate the target primary signal power from the co-channel and adjacent-channel interference produced by the simultaneous data transmissions in the secondary networks. Then, the interference can be cancelled when constructing the test statistic for the energy detectors. Both analyzing and simulation results show that the proposed method is able to successfully cancel the interference and can achieve a good performance.	channel capacity;cognitive radio;coherence (physics);geolocation;interference (communication);interrupt;network packet;quality of service;real-time clock;sensor;simulation;transmitter	Bingxuan Zhao;Shigenobu Sasaki	2013	IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology	10.1109/ISSPIT.2013.6781880	synchronization;transmitter;adjacent-channel interference;cognitive radio;quiet period;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;interference;signal-to-noise ratio;detection theory;computer network	Embedded	27.55659802698338	97.26682598173478	88026

However, unlike the zero-interference ZF,the optimal power allocation issue using CIR is a nonconvex optimization problem which will become more intractable with nonconvex QoS constraints. In this paper we focus on the challenging QoS-aware optimal power allocation problem, aiming to maximize the system sum rate and guarantee the users’ minimum data rates. As a result, an “Iterative Geometric Programming” (IGP) strategy is proposed which transforms the underlying problem to a series of tractable Geometric Programming (GP) problems through an iterative convex approximation. Extensive simulations have been conducted and the results indicate that IGP is quite suitable to tackle the problem, which can achieve a good balance between the system sum rate and the individual QoS requirements.

Due to the tremendous propagation loss of mmWave communication, device-to-device (D2D) communications are widely used over directional mmWave networks to improve the network throughput. In this paper, a new time resource sharing scheme is proposed based on Stackelberg game for interference D2D links to further enhance the network throughput. The D2D links causing interference can access to the time resource by paying higher price, while the D2D links causing no interference can also be scheduled in the scheme. Concurrent transmission scheduling between D2D links causing interference is formulated as a non-cooperative game, which achieves a distributed transmission power control solution among the interference D2D links. Moreover, the price strategy can be adjusted by setting the interference threshold such that the transmission quality can be guaranteed. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve significant network throughput gain compared with traditional concurrent transmission scheme.	distributed transmission system;fifth generation computer;interference (communication);operand forwarding;scheduling (computing);simulation;software propagation;throughput	Yu Li;Zufan Zhang;Wei Wang;Honggang Wang	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2017.7996369	throughput;resource management;power control;computer network;computer science;scheduling (computing);stackelberg competition;shared resource;transmission (mechanics);cellular network	Mobile	26.506763830040803	92.08810907429259	88743

Simulation results show that the proposed resource allocation algorithm can improve the capacity significantly compared with static FDMA fixed allocation algorithm and the MIMO-OFDMA scheme, and the more important thing is that it can make the capacity be distributed more fairly, very close to the ideal rate constraints, among users than the scheme which maximizes the system capacity only.	fairness measure;multi-user;subcarrier;user space	Jian Xu;Jong-Soo Seo	2010	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-009-9677-4	real-time computing;space–time block code;max-min fairness;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;mathematics	Mobile	33.29771024293499	90.44074254463256	88887

The subcarrier allocation for multicast services in multicarrier systems is a feasible solution to overcome the capacity limitation by exploiting the frequency diversity among subcarriers. However, most of the current subcarrier allocation algorithms are limited to unicast services. In this paper, we propose an optimal subcarrier allocation algorithm for multicast services with Quality of Services (QoS) guarantees. A low-complexity suboptimal algorithm is also proposed, which includes three steps: Conservative Allocation, Greedy Step and Iterative Enhancement. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms significantly outperform the conventional multicast transmission scheme while at the same time guaranteeing the minimum data rates of all users. Moreover, simulation results also show that the performance difference between the optimal and suboptimal algorithms is small.	greedy algorithm;iso 10303;iterative method;memory management;multicast;quality of service;requirement;simulation;subcarrier;throughput;unicast	Lin Tian;Di Pang;Yubo Yang;Jinglin Shi;Gengfa Fang;Eryk Dutkiewicz	2010	2010 IEEE Wireless Communication and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2010.5506421	multicast;telecommunications;protocol independent multicast;computer science;resource management;distributed computing;iterative method;source-specific multicast;xcast;computer network	Mobile	33.38311355521507	90.73264565662998	88933

We consider the power optimization under brightness and communication requirements for RGB LEDs, and model the color constraint using the MacAdam ellipse instead of a fixed point in the chromaticity diagram. Then an optimization problem is formulated to determine the transmission power consumption and the corresponding coordinates in the chromaticity diagram. We propose a novel two-step algorithm to solve the optimization problem with lower implementation complexity. Numerical results show that the proposed approach shows the same performance as the optimal solution using a brute-force method, and requires the lower power consumption using MacAdam ellipse instead of merely a fixed point in the chromaticity diagram.	algorithm;computational complexity theory;diagram;fixed point (mathematics);mathematical optimization;numerical method;optimization problem;power optimization (eda);requirement;vlc media player	Shun Lou;Chen Gong;Nan Wu;Zhengyuan Xu	2017	Journal of Communications and Information Networks	10.1007/s41650-017-0043-5	chromaticity;fixed point;control theory;power optimization;rgb color model;visible light communication;macadam ellipse;brightness;mathematics;optimization problem	EDA	36.898226435671724	92.64438967145712	89031

In this paper, a downlink transmission mode selection method is proposed, aiming at improving cell-edge throughput without reducing cell-center user rate. To reduce the adverse impact of the overhead, we select the following users for CoMP transmission: those can obtain significant performance gain from CoMP and those can increase the multiplexing gain. A threshold for large scale SINR is defined to find cell-edge users. An adaptive orthogonal threshold is designed for selecting partner users for the cell-edge users. Impact of the two thresholds are analyzed and performance of the proposed method are evaluated through simulations, which shows evident performance gain over both Non-CoMP and Full-CoMP systems.	coherence (physics);multiplexing;oracle call interface;overhead (computing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;throughput	Qian Zhang;Chenyang Yang	2011	2011 IEEE 73rd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VETECS.2011.5956634	spectrum;cellular network;electronic engineering;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;base station;antenna;interference;signal-to-noise ratio;multiplexing;computer network;data transmission;mimo	Mobile	28.37783309327277	88.96180334055379	89125

In order to limit the forced termination probability of secondary users a fractional guard channel reservation scheme is applied to give priority to spectrum handovers over new arrivals. We show that, contrary to what has been suggested, the reservation parameter cannot be adequately adjusted as a result of maximizing the throughput of secondary users. Instead we propose and explore two alternative configuration methods. The proposed methods are based on optimization problems that target the existing trade-off between blocking new sessions of secondary users and dropping ongoing ones.

e5116d52fd0d1931528fbf2a4dcefa22ad7c5de2	kolkata paise restaurant game for resource allocation in the internet of things		The Internet of Things (IoT) is a promising networking technology that will realize many innovative smart city applications. It is anticipated that the number of connected IoT devices will greatly outweigh the available communication resources, and, thus, a key challenge is to optimize the allocation of wireless resources among the IoT devices, which are often limited in their functionality. In this paper, a distributed approach is proposed for enabling IoT devices with incomplete information and multiple objectives to effectively utilize the limited communication resources. In particular, a massive IoT consisting of IoT devices with imperfect knowledge competing over limited communication resources is formulated using a novel Kolkata paise restaurant game. For the formulated game, it is shown that the socially optimal solution coincides with the Nash equilibrium. Furthermore, a learning framework is developed to enable the IoT devices to autonomously learn their equilibrium strategies to optimize their transmission. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme in increasing the number of successful transmissions as a function of the amount of available information, device density, and transmission probability is analyzed. Simulation results show that the proposed learning framework can significantly increase the percentage of communication resources used to successfully transmit by up to threefold, compared to a baseline random allocation scheme. The results also show that the proposed learning framework with imperfect knowledge is more effective in an IoT with higher device density.	baseline (configuration management);internet of things;nash equilibrium;optimization problem;preference learning;simulation;smart city	Taehyeun Park;Walid Saad	2017	2017 51st Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers	10.1109/ACSSC.2017.8335666	smart city;mathematical optimization;resource management;wireless sensor network;complete information;wireless;computer science;distributed computing;nash equilibrium;internet of things;resource allocation	AI	31.21949337045073	96.1466162302905	89324

Let edge users be the users beyond a certain distance to the associated BS in their covering cell, where the receiving intended signal is relative small. Throughput of edge users is the key metric measuring system performance. Originally designed for improving the performance of edge users under different scenarios, many technologies of user scheduling and power allocation, such as coordinated multipoint and Nash noncooperative power game are proposed. However, the existing algorithms are generally heuristic leading to a large performance gap in different scenarios. In this paper, we formulate a joint optimization to integrate user scheduling and power allocation into a unified optimization framework. By proposing a novel power-fractionizing mechanism, binary optimization can be avoided and the scheduling can be incorporated into the power allocation process. Thereafter, the joint optimization problem is then transformed into a signomial programming (SP) problem, which is further approximated by iteratively solving a series of tractable geometric programming problems that can converge to at least a local optimum of the SP problem. Unlike the existing heuristic algorithms dedicated to specific scenarios, our algorithm is more robust and environment adaptive. Simulation results show that the proposed joint optimization outperforms the existing heuristic approaches by significantly improving the total edge user throughput with stable performance.	approximation algorithm;cobham's thesis;converge;geometric programming;heuristic;local optimum;mathematical optimization;multipoint ground;nash equilibrium;optimization problem;scheduling (computing);signomial;simulation;throughput	Shu Fu;Hong Wen;Bin Wu	2018	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2016.2644664	fair-share scheduling;dynamic priority scheduling;scheduling (computing);scheduling (production processes);mathematical optimization;two-level scheduling;geometric programming;computer science;rate-monotonic scheduling;optimization problem	Metrics	33.80513285687384	91.85486100530458	89503

In D2D communications, mobile nodes can communicate in a semi-autonomous way, with minimal or no control by the base station (BS). In this context, we address the problem of the coexistence of cellular and D2D tiers in the uplink frequencies, where a D2D source is allowed to transmit without direct control of its scheduling by the base station (BS). In order to limit the interference, we add a punishment mechanism triggered by the BS to limit the activity of disturbing terminals. We propose a context- aware channel access mechanism for a D2D source, where the context-awareness is obtained by 1) observing the topology and the wireless transmissions in the proximity of the D2D source, and 2) exploiting the past knowledge learned thanks to a Bayesian network approach. To design the channel access mechanism, we study the tradeoff between maximizing the end-to-end throughput and minimizing the interference to the cellular tier. We then evaluate the performance improvement of the proposed solution, showing the effectiveness of the learning mechanism and the advantages of context awareness.	autonomous robot;bayesian network;capacity loss;centralized computing;coexist (image);context awareness;end-to-end encryption;interference (communication);multitier architecture;real-time clock;scheduling (computing);semiconductor industry;telecommunications link;throughput;time-varying network	Federico Librino;Giorgio Quer	2016	2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7841714	throughput;telecommunications link;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;interference;computer network	Mobile	26.332245654479983	90.85132119290786	89528

We propose a joint power allocation and subcarrier pairing scheme which maximizes the transmission rate subject to total network power constraint.

In this case, the roles of infrastructure providers (InPs) and mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) can be logically separated and the resources (e.g., subchannels, power, and antennas) of a base station owned by an InP can be transparently shared by multiple MVNOs, while each MVNO virtually owns the entire BS. Naturally, the issue of resource allocation arises. In particular, the InP is required to abstract the physical resources into isolated slices for each MVNO who then allocates the resources within the slice to its subscribed users. In this paper, we aim to address this two-level hierarchical resource allocation problem while satisfying the requirements of efficient resource allocation, strict inter-slice isolation, and the ability of intra-slice customization. To this end, we design a hierarchical combinatorial auction mechanism, based on which a truthful and sub-efficient resource allocation framework is provided. Specifically, winner determination problems (WDPs) are formulated for the InP and MVNOs, and computationally tractable algorithms are proposed to solve these WDPs. Also, pricing schemes are designed to ensure incentive compatibility. The designed mechanism can achieve social efficiency in each level even if each party involved acts selfishly. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.	bayesian network;cobham's thesis;coupling (computer programming);fairness measure;fifth generation computer;greedy algorithm;heuristic (computer science);inp (database);mimo;numerical method;public key infrastructure;requirement;telephone exchange;value (ethics)	Kun Zhu;Ekram Hossain	2016	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2015.2506578	mechanism design;virtualization;simulation;incentive compatibility;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;resource management;operating system;distributed computing;mobile computing;wireless;computer network;mimo	Mobile	30.100978422179868	94.97293931431014	89647

Furthermore, OFDMA-based femtocells have proven to be highly versatile when dealing with cross-layer co-channel interference thanks to the allocation of frequency subchannels. However, concerns still exist related to the impact of the different access methods to femtocells in an overlayed network. Femtocells based on a Closed Subscribers Group, where only device owners are allowed connectivity introduce severe interference to macrocell users. On the other hand, Open Access femtocells where any user can connect, does not bring many advantages to the femtocell owner. In this paper, an intermediate access method based on a limited access is proposed. The performance of the model is evaluated throughout system-level simulations and it is shown that limited access contributes to seriously reduce cross-layer interference while guaranteeing a minimum performance to the femtocell subscribers.	constructive solid geometry;interference (communication);normalized frequency (fiber optics);simulation;throughput;user experience	Alvaro Valcarce Rial;David López-Pérez;Guillaume de la Roche;Jie Zhang	2009	2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5450325	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Arch	26.929177667689423	89.45645903010616	89743

A distributed association and power update algorithm is proposed and shown to converge to a Nash equilibrium of a noncooperative game. We consider network models with discrete mobiles (yielding an atomic congestion game), as well as a continuum of mobiles (yielding a population game). We find that the equilibria need not be Pareto efficient, nor need they be system optimal. To address the lack of system optimality, we propose pricing mechanisms. It is shown that these mechanisms can be implemented in a distributed fashion.	algorithm;converge;nash equilibrium;network congestion;pareto efficiency;telecommunications link;triune continuum paradigm	Chandramani Kishore Singh;Anurag Kumar;Rajesh Sundaresan	2016	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking	10.1109/TNET.2015.2417217	non-cooperative game;pricing;games;cellular network;simulation;mobile telephony;telecommunications;power control;computer science;base station;operating system;interference;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	31.174133784562237	94.83536429978041	89816

The problem formulation captures the heterogeneity of the medium, in terms of different service areas, channel conditions, available resources at BSs/APs of different networks, and different available maximum power at the MTs. In addition, the framework is implemented in a decentralized manner which is desirable in a case that different networks are operated by different service providers.

This important resource management problem is shown to be NP-hard. In this paper, a novel semi-distributed algorithm, called SD-MUCS, is proposed for the multichannel conflict-free TDMA link scheduling. SD-MUCS is designed based on the semi-distributed architecture as one of the most promising proposed network structures for 5G. Thus, it takes advantage of parallel processing while imposing a tolerable overhead on the network. Compared to the existing link schedulers, SD-MUCS offers a more spectrally efficient solution which well suits massive expected demand in 5G.	central processing unit;centralized computing;distributed algorithm;distributed computing;np-hardness;overhead (computing);parallel computing;parallel programming model;scheduling (computing);secure digital;semiconductor industry;serializability	Zahra Naghsh;Shahrokh Valaee	2017	2017 51st Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers	10.1109/ACSSC.2017.8335586	architecture;mathematical optimization;resource management;reuse;network topology;computer science;scheduling (computing);time division multiple access;schedule;parallel processing;distributed computing	Mobile	28.869893962682767	94.3671859388601	90092

We model the network as a parallel Gaussian interference channel and we introduce a fully decentralized algorithm (based on trial and error) able to statistically achieve a configuration where the performance demands are met. Contrary to existing solutions, our algorithm requires only local information and can learn stable and efficient working points by using only one bit feedback. We model the network under two different game theoretical frameworks: normal form and satisfaction form. We show that the converging points correspond to equilibrium points, namely Nash and satisfaction equilibrium. Similarly, we provide sufficient conditions for the algorithm to converge in both formulations. Moreover, we provide analytical results to estimate the algorithm's performance, as a function of the network parameters.

78dcae4783f37ffca07696e1cedfd71d1ffae633	psma for 5g: network throughput analysis		In this paper, a new approach for multiple access (MA) in fifth generation (5G) of cellular networks called power domain sparse code multiple access (PSMA) is proposed. In PSMA, we adopt both the power domain and the code domain to transmit multiple users' signals over a subcarrier simultaneously. In such a model, the same sparse code multiple access (SCMA) codebook can be used by multiple users where, for these users, power domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) technique is used to send signals non-orthogonally. Although different SCMA codebooks are orthogonal and produce no interference over each other, the same codebook used by multiple users produces interference over these users. We investigate the signal model as well as the receiver and transmitter of the PSMA method. To evaluate the performance of PSMA, we consider a single cell with multiple users. In this case, our design objective is to maximize the system sum rate of the network subject to some system level and QoS constraints such as transmit power constraints. We formulate the proposed resource allocation problem as an optimization problem and solve it by successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is investigated using numerical results.	approximation algorithm;codebook;fifth generation computer;interference (communication);iteration;iterative method;mathematical optimization;multi-user;neural coding;numerical analysis;optimization problem;power domains;simulation;sparse matrix;subcarrier;throughput;transmitter	Mohammad Moltafet;Nader Mokari;Mohammad R.

In order to improve power and spectrum utilization while mitigate the intra-beam interference and inter-beam interference, the crucial challenge is joint precoding design for multiple terminals. This paper proposes a hybrid full frequency (HFF) joint precoding scheme and chooses transmit power minimization as the energy efficient optimization problem which can be formulated as an indefinite quadratic optimization program. An optimization algorithm based on semidefinite programming (SDP) is designed to obtain the optimal objective. Simulation results demonstrate the performance improvement of proposed HFF joint precoding outperforms conventional frequency reuse and existing algorithms with respect to per feed power on-board constrained.	algorithm;communications satellite;interference (communication);mimo;mathematical optimization;on-board data handling;optimization problem;semidefinite programming;simulation;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding	Hongjun Li;Feihong Dong;Yuanzhi He;Bo Jing;Jingchao Wang;Fu-Chun Han;Jing Wang	2016	2016 IEEE 83rd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2016.7504222	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;logic gate;zero-forcing precoding;control theory;mathematics;interference;precoding;satellite;statistics	EDA	37.998364607572285	90.82398657719466	90295
ae60fd9f0f313cc46a5a73be6d2aba2fbd54c381	optimally myopic scheduling policy for downlink channels with imperfect state observation		We consider a downlink channel scheduling problem in a wireless communication system where a base station serves a user by a number $N$ of multistate Markov channels. In each time slot one channel is allocated to the user according to imperfect state observation information, and some reward is accrued depending on the state of the allocated channel. The objective is to design a scheduling policy that maximizes the expected accumulated discounted reward over an infinite time horizon. Mathematically, the decision-making problem can be formulated into a restless multiarmed bandit with exponential memory and time complexity. One of the feasible policies is the myopic (or greedy) one, which only maximizes the immediate reward with linear complexity. Specifically, we carry out a theoretical analysis on the performance of the myopic policy with imperfect observation, introduce the monotone likelihood ratio order to characterize the evolving structure of information states, and establish a set of closed-form conditions to guarantee the optimality of the myopic policy in downlink channel allocation.	greedy algorithm;markov chain;multi-armed bandit;scheduling (computing);telecommunications link;time complexity;monotone	Kehao Wang	2018	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2018.2800697	time complexity;computer network;mathematical optimization;job shop scheduling;time horizon;channel allocation schemes;scheduling (computing);computer science;markov process;communication channel;markov chain	Embedded	27.203963261794133	97.27865935158844	90520

USN has emerged as a key networking architecture in 5G wireless networks. It can improve network coverage and boost system capacity. However, the dense overlapped deployment of small cells leads to a complex interference problem. In this paper, we jointly implement multi-domain interference management technology to mitigate interference, where we jointly investigate the OFDMA scheduling, interference alignment (IA), TDMA scheduling, and power optimization. We formulate the small cells' interference coordination problem as an overlapping coalition formation game (OCFG). OCFG can help to effectively perform IA. Based on this, we propose a distributed joint interference management (JIM) scheme. By using the proposed algorithm, each SBS can interact and self-organize into a stable overlapping coalitional structure and reduce interference from different domains, thus optimizing the tradeoff between the benefits and costs. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed JIM yields a performance improvement in terms of the system throughput, compared to others.	algorithm;catastrophic interference;channel capacity;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;power optimization (eda);scheduling (computing);self-organization;simulation;smart battery system;software deployment;throughput	Jia Xiao;Chungang Yang;Jiaheng Wang;Haoxiang Dai	2016	2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752514	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	Mobile	26.5366829177249	90.73905945483614	90560

EGT is a suitable tool to address the problem of resource allocation in self-organizing small cells since it allows the players with bounded-rationality to learn from the environment and take individual decisions for attaining the equilibrium with minimum information exchange. EGT-based resource allocation can also provide fairness among users. We show how EGT can be used for distributed subcarrier and power allocation in orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)-based small cell networks while limiting interference to the macrocell users below given thresholds. Two game models are considered, where the utility of each small cell depends on average achievable signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and data rate, respectively. Forthe proposed distributed resource allocation method, the average SINR and data rate are obtained based on a stochastic geometry analysis. Replicator dynamics is used to model the strategy adaptation process of the small cell base stations and an evolutionary equilibrium is obtained as the solution. Based on the results obtained using stochastic geometry, the stability of the equilibrium is analyzed. We also extend the formulation by considering information exchange delay and investigate its impact on the convergence of the algorithm. Numerical results are presented to validate ourtheoretical findings and to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in comparison to a centralized resource allocation scheme.	algorithm;centralized computing;data rate units;exptime;evolutionary governance theory;fairness measure;fixed point (mathematics);game theory;hp 48 series;information exchange;interference (communication);like button;numerical method;organizing (structure);rationality;self-organization;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;subcarrier;uncompressed video	Prabodini Semasinghe;Ekram Hossain;Kun Zhu	2015	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2014.2318700	games;mathematical optimization;evolutionary game theory;self-organization;simulation;poisson point process;resource allocation;computer science;resource management;theoretical computer science;interference;small cell;scattering;signal-to-noise ratio;statistics;stochastic geometry	Metrics	31.596805438149342	93.25823857259134	90974

The asymptotic noise-limited regime is also discussed as a special case.

However, not only the energy scarcity, but also the quality of service (QoS) guarantees need to be taken into account for the WSNs. Different types of applications in the WSNs impose the new challenge on heterogeneous QoS provisioning for the WSNs. To solve the above problem, in this paper, we develop the joint downlink energy assignment and uplink power control scheme with the heterogeneous statistical QoS provisioning (HeP) for wireless powered sensor networks (WPSNs). In particular, we build up the HeP model, where the aggregate effective capacity (AEC) is defined as the aggregate throughput under the statistical QoS constraints for the WPSNs. Based on the mode, we formulate the AEC maximization problems for uniformed time division and dynamic time allocation scenarios, respectively. For the uniformed time division scenario, we divide the AEC maximization problem into the hybrid access point determined downlink energy assignment problem and the sensor node determined uplink power control problem. Then, we solve these problems and obtain the corresponding closed-form solutions. For the dynamic time allocation scenario, we develop the joint time allocation, downlink energy assignment, and uplink power control scheme to maximize the AEC and iteratively derive the scheme. Extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effect of heterogeneous statistical QoS on our developed resource allocation schemes for WPSNs. The results show that the HeP resource allocation schemes are superior to the schemes with homogeneous statistical QoS guarantees.	aggregate data;assignment problem;echo suppression and cancellation;entropy maximization;expectation–maximization algorithm;provisioning;quality of service;rain fade;sensor node;simulation;telecommunications link;throughput;wireless access point	Ya Gao;Wenchi Cheng;Hailin Zhang;Yuquan Li	2017	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2694046	real-time computing;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Embedded	31.176041324437303	90.92089810647852	91246

However, this mechanism requires the users' voluntary contributions, which cannot be guaranteed since users are selfish and only care about their own performance. Furthermore, users may have heterogeneous costs (which are their private information) to forward packets, and they may lie about their costs if cheating can improve their utilities. To address these problems, in this paper, we model the interaction among users in the wireless multicast system as a multiseller multibuyer payment-based game, where users pay to receive relay service and get paid if they forward packets to others. A simplified case with homogeneous users that have the same cost to forward packets is investigated first. Then, for the case with heterogeneous users, to encourage users to tell their true costs, we use the second-price sealed-bid auction, which is a truth-telling auction, since bidding the true cost is a weakly dominant strategy. To analyze the multiseller multibuyer payment-based game, we observe that under different selected prices, the game can converge to different equilibria, resulting in different user free-riding probabilities and system throughput. We also study the price selection problem and derive the optimal price that maximizes the system throughput.

Because the formulated problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problem with an extremely high computational complexity, we propose a low-complexity suboptimal algorithm, which is a two-step separated subchannel and power allocation algorithm. In the first step, subchannels are allocated to each user, whereas in the second step, the optimal power allocation is carried out on the basis of the given subchannel allocation and the nonlinear interval Gauss–Seidel method. Simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can achieve a good trade-off between the efficiency and the fairness compared with two other existing relevant algorithms. In particular, the proposed algorithm can always achieve 100% fairness under various conditions.

We consider multi-antenna base stations (BSs) and single-antenna users, BS coordination, 3D antenna patterns, and fair scheduling. We investigate the impact of the elevation angle of the BS antenna pattern, denoted as tilt, on the performance of the considered SCN when employing either a conventional uncoordinated transmission mode or a fully coordinated transmission mode. Using the results of this investigation, we propose a novel hybrid-mode transmission technique that can achieve a performance comparable to that of a fully coordinated transmission but with a significantly lower complexity and signaling requirement. The main idea is to divide the coverage area into two so-called vertical regions and jointly adapt the transmission mode and the tilt at the BSs when serving each region. A fair scheduler is used to share the time-slots between the vertical regions and among the users in each region.	fair-share scheduling;radiation pattern;scheduling (computing);telecommunications link	Nima Seifi;Robert W.

As an information-theoretic paradigm, secrecy rate derives bounds for secure transmission when the channel to the eavesdropper is known. However, such bounds are shown to be restrictive in practice and may require exploitation of specialized coding schemes. In this paper, we employ the concept of directional modulation and follow a signal processing approach to enhance the security of multiuser multi-input multioutput (MIMO) communication systems when a multiantenna eavesdropper is present. Security enhancement is accomplished by increasing the symbol error rate at the eavesdropper. Unlike the information-theoretic secrecy rate paradigm, we assume that the legitimate transmitter is not aware of its channel to the eavesdropper, which is a more realistic assumption. We examine the applicability of MIMO receiving algorithms at the eavesdropper. Using the channel knowledge and the intended symbols for the users, we design security enhancing symbol-level precoders for different transmitter and eavesdropper antenna configurations. We transform each design problem to a linearly constrained quadratic program and propose two solutions, namely the iterative algorithm and one based on nonnegative least squares, at each scenario for a computationally efficient modulation. Simulation results verify the analysis and show that the designed precoders outperform the benchmark scheme in terms of both power efficiency and security enhancement.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;benchmark (computing);information theory;iterative method;mimo;mimo-ofdm;modulation;multi-user;multi-user mimo;non-negative least squares;numerical analysis;performance per watt;programming paradigm;quadratic programming;secure transmission;sensor;signal processing;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;symbol level;transmitter;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Ashkan Kalantari;Mojtaba Soltanalian;Sina Maleki;Symeon Chatzinotas;Björn E.

At the same time, the future cellular networks will have to fulfill stringent latency constraints. To that end, one problem that is posed as a potential showstopper is extreme congestion for requesting uplink scheduling over the physical random access channel (PRACH). Indeed, such congestion drags along scheduling delay problems. In this paper, the use of self-organized device-to-device (D2D) clustering is advocated for mitigating PRACH congestion. To this end, the paper proposes two D2D clustering schemes, namely; Random-Based Clustering (RBC) and Channel-Gain-Based Clustering (CGBC). Accordingly, this paper sheds light on random access within the proposed D2D clustering schemes and presents a case study based on a stochastic geometry framework. For the sake of objective evaluation, the D2D clustering is benchmarked by the conventional scheduling request procedure. Accordingly, the paper offers insights into useful scenarios that minimize the scheduling delay for each clustering scheme. Finally, the paper discusses the implementation algorithm and some potential implementation issues and remedies.	approximation algorithm;bell's theorem;benchmark (computing);cluster analysis;cylinder-head-sector;exptime;emoticon;interference (communication);mass effect trilogy;mathematical optimization;network congestion;optimization problem;overhead (computing);physical review a;random access;role-based collaboration;scheduling (computing);self-organization;software bug;telecommunications link;traffic collision avoidance system	Mohammad Gharbieh;Ahmed Bader;Hesham Elsawy;Hong-Chuan Yang;Mohamed-Slim Alouini;Abdulkareem Adinoyi	2018	CoRR		electronic engineering;stochastic geometry;computer network;scheduling (computing);latency (engineering);telecommunications link;cluster analysis;computer science;random-access channel;random access;cellular network	Metrics	25.195010563989733	89.58268071170305	91559
f2b94482f6c4d1c1f319a73b3987f55ed22db0d2	a handoff algorithm based on estimated load for dense green 5g networks		Two important challenges facing 5G are energy efficiency and mobile users' mobility in heterogeneous wireless networks (HetNets). One of the important techniques for improving energy efficiency is base station (BS)'s switching between ON and OFF modes which allows the BS to turn off some its components in lower load situations. In this paper, we address user's seamless mobility problem and propose a handoff (HO) algorithm based on BS's estimated load. The proposed HO algorithm based on estimated load (PHA-EL) balances load by imposing HOs from highly loaded BSs to lightly loaded BSs. When a BS is overloaded, the user's quality of service (QoS) will degrade and therefore the PHA-EL is used to improve system throughput. The PHA-EL algorithm is combined with BSs which are able to switch between ON and OFF modes (PHA-EL/ON-OFF switching) in order to improve the energy efficiency of the system.Therefore, this algorithm achieves both energy- and spectral- efficiency. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm yields better performance in terms of average number of HOs, average load per BS and average payoff per BS, compared to baseline algorithm.	algorithm;baseline (configuration management);function overloading;interference (communication);load (computing);quality of service;seamless3d;simulation;spectral efficiency;throughput	Atefeh Hajijamali Arani;Mohammad Javad Omidi;Abolfazl Mehbodniya;Fumiyuki Adachi	2014	2015 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7417634	games;real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;network switch;computer science;wireless network;interference;computer network	HPC	25.707387996163416	91.2528475816117	91776

One of the most fundamental problems in cooperative spectrum sensing is how to assign Secondary Users (SUs) to sense different primary channels such that SUs can achieve a good balance between sensing accuracy and the exploration of potential “spectrum holes”. This problem becomes more challenging when the primary channels require heterogeneous detection probabilities for incumbent protection. In this paper, the Cooperative Sensing Scheduling with QoS guarantee (CSS-Q) problem is studied for designing energy-efficient CRNs.We first explore the inherent structure of the CSS-Q problem and find several useful properties for it. Then, based on these properties a novel and efficient algorithm is proposed to solve the problem optimally. Sufficient numerical results are also presented to validate our analysis.	algorithm;cascading style sheets;cognitive radio;numerical analysis;numerical method;provisioning;quality of service;requirement;scheduling (computing);vp/css	Xiangxia Sun;Tengyi Zhang;Danny H.

The problem is to efficiently manage inter-cell interference in a multi-cell environment, by so-called transmitter cooperation, in order to reduce the diminishing effects of interference on the networks performance. To allow for application in deployable networks, an utmost concern of the presented algorithm is to provide a low-complexity solution avoiding costly combinatorial or non-convex optimization problems. The problem is solved by a network wide successive allocation of data streams and choosing linear transmit and receive filters for each data stream, such that interference is completely avoided. By embedding our new algorithm in a more general framework for interference coordination, we can show relevant gains for network performance where especially the cell-edge users profit.	algorithm;channel state information;convex optimization;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;multi-user mimo;network performance;overhead (computing);simulation;telecommunications link;transmitter	Andreas Dotzler;Wolfgang Utschick;Guido Dietl	2011	2011 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2011.5779413	transmitter;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;distributed computing;statistics	Metrics	35.39459198998014	91.2537560998881	91844

Aiming to derive the maximum performance of the LTE uplink in terms of both average cell throughput and cell-edge user throughput, the optimization formulation of packet scheduling problem in LTE uplink is proposed in this paper. The optimization formulation defines the packet scheduling problem as a transform of the knapsack problem and utilizes the integer linear programming (ILP) method to provide the feasible optimum resource allocation based on the combination of allocable resources with various constraints in LTE uplink. Moreover, to reduce the complexity of the ILP, a limitation on the valid combination of allocable resources is also considered. Simulation results show that the feasible optimum solution derived by the proposed optimization formulation, has a significant improvement of up to 40% and 263.8% over the heuristic proportional fairness packet scheduling in terms of the average cell throughput and cell-edge user throughput, respectively. The feasible optimum solution derived by the proposed optimization formation is useful for evaluating various heuristic resource allocation algorithms.	algorithm;carrier frequency;compaq lte;fairness measure;heuristic;instruction scheduling;integer programming;knapsack problem;linear programming;mathematical optimization;memory management;network packet;proportionally fair;scheduling (computing);simulation;telecommunications link;throughput	Xiaoqiu Wang;Satoshi Konishi	2010	2010 IEEE 71st Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2010.5493797	mathematical optimization;real-time computing;integer programming;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;scheduling	Mobile	28.091393048140205	92.76994292577899	91924

However, several challenges need to be met in order to fulfil these promises. Femto-cells are likely to be deployed in an adhoc manner due to the infeasibility of carrying out comprehensive spectrum planning as in legacy cellular networks. One of the major issues with such a deployment is the problem of interference between cells. It is possible that femto-cells may interfere with their neighboring cells if they use the same frequency resources. This paper proposes a distributed radio resource management (DRRM) algorithm to address this problem and studies its performance through experiments in a test-bed. Results from this study indicate that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve performance compared to the randomized allocation regime. In light of the deployment considerations, the results are particularly significant given the simplicity and practicality of the proposed solution.	autonomous robot;distributed algorithm;experiment;interference (communication);performance evaluation;radio resource management;randomized algorithm;randomness;software deployment;testbed	Parag Kulkarni;Sedat Gormus;Woon Hau Chin;Russell J.

The conventional approach guaranteeing global optimality is to solve an integer programming model with explicit SINR constraints. These constraints are however numerically very difficult. We develop a new integer programming algorithm based on a much more effective representation of the SINR constraints. Computational experiments demonstrate that the new approach performs significantly better in proving optimality.	branch and cut;computation;exact algorithm;experiment;integer programming;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;numerical stability;programming model;requirement;scheduling (computing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio	Antonio Capone;Lei Chen;Stefano Gualandi;Di Yuan	2011	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2011.030311.100777	mathematical optimization;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;telecommunications;computer science;linear programming;theoretical computer science;wireless network;mathematics	Vision	35.07282936333902	91.80013944808967	92357

The general principle of resource allocation in an OFDMA system is to assign each subcarrier to the user with the best channel condition for that subcarrier. However, in delay tolerant traffic, current work did not consider that packets on retransmissions may have different allocation criteria from those on their first transmissions. In this paper, the resource allocation scheme is investigated by considering different criterions to packets on first transmissions and on retransmissions. Under a bit error rate (BER) constraint, the objective is to maximize the throughput of packets on first transmissions, meanwhile decreasing the longest packet delay caused by retransmitted packets and guaranteeing all packets on retransmissions to be sent out. A low-complexity suboptimal algorithm that separates allocation for packets on retransmissions and on first transmissions is proposed. In the proposed algorithm, for packets on retransmissions the resource allocation can be formulated to minimize power consumption; for packets on first transmissions the resource allocation is carried out to maximize throughput. Adaptive modulation scheme is adopted to guarantee the BER constraint, except the modulation for each retransmitted packet remains the same. In order to improve retransmission liability, the retransmitted packets are combined with its failed packets in previous transmission.	algorithm;bit error rate;frequency divider;hybrid automatic repeat request;mathematical optimization;memory management;modulation;multi-user;network packet;numerical analysis;performance evaluation;retransmission (data networks);subcarrier;telecommunications link;throughput;x.690	Xiaoyan Liu;Huiling Zhu	2010	2010 IEEE 71st Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2010.5493995	throughput;real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;index term;quality of service;telecommunications link;bit error rate;link adaptation;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;resource management;automatic repeat request;signal-to-noise ratio;wireless;computer network;out-of-order delivery;modulation	Embedded	33.228423551262814	89.89385598699475	92532

To improve the performance of in-network caching in device-to-device (D2D) communications, caching placement and content delivery should be jointly optimized. To this end, we jointly optimize caching decision and content discovery strategies by considering the successful content delivery in D2D links for maximizing the in-network caching gain through D2D communications.Moreover, an in-network caching placement problem is formulated as an integer nonlinear optimization problem. To obtain the optimal solution for the proposed problem, Lagrange dual decomposition is applied in order to reduce the complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has a near-optimal performance, approaching that of the exhaustive search method. Furthermore, the proposed scheme has a notable in-network caching gain and an improvement in traffic offloading compared to that of other caching placement schemes.

In this paper, we propose a transmit power control for energy efficient operation of a dense small cell network. We cast the power control problem as a noncooperative game to satisfy the design requirement that small cells do not need any information exchange among them. We analyze the sufficient condition for the existence of a Nash equilibrium (NE) state of the proposed game. We also analyze that the NE state is unique by transforming the original nonlinear fractional programming problem into a nonlinear parametric programming problem. Through simulation studies, we verify our analysis results. In addition, we show that the proposed method achieves higher energy efficiency of a network and balances the energy efficiency among cells more evenly than the methods based on the AIMD (additive increase and multiplicative decrease) algorithm.

In addition, the exploration process is exclusively induced by the failure of the channel choice and directs the agent to the next best channel. The quantum technique is compared with traditional reinforcement learning, random assignment reinforcement learning, and random dynamic channel assignment algorithms. This quantum technique is shown to increase the speed of learning convergence of traditional reinforcement learning by up to 40 times. Thus, system capacity can be improved in terms of the number of users by (9-84) %, and provides a significant average file delay reduction of 26% on average, and throughput improvement of up to 2.8%.	algorithm;channel capacity;machine learning;reinforcement learning;telecommunications network;throughput	Sinan Nuuman;David Grace;Tim Clarke	2015	2015 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference Workshops (WCNCW)	10.1109/WCNCW.2015.7122566	throughput;cognitive radio;convergence;computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;machine learning;reinforcement learning;computer network	Robotics	26.672123107132442	96.64626974208025	93461

The imposed variational optimization framework provides an interesting link between the a posteriori probability (APP) based demodulators and the linear SISO equalizers, enabling us to gain new insight into the optimality of these equalizers in the context of turbo processing.

In this paper, we discussed the basic theory of NOMA system first of all. Then, we studied the systems capacity optimization problem of NOMA system under the constraints of total transmit power and the minimum rate of the weaker user. Then a tree topology power allocation algorithm is discussed, which achieves the same performance as the FSPA method. but its computation complexity decreases from exponential to constant. The results of numerical simulation showed proposed algorithm has lower computational complexity and can realize higher system capacity. Meanwhile, higher system capacity can be achieved through adjusting the power allocation factor α in FPA algorithm.	algorithm;capacity optimization;channel capacity;coefficient;computation;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;horner's method;mathematical optimization;multi-user;network topology;numerical analysis;optimization problem;requirement;search algorithm;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;time complexity;tree network;tree structure;tree traversal	Ying Lin;Suoping Li;Duo Peng;Yamei Xu	2017	2017 13th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)	10.1109/FSKD.2017.8393219	transmitter power output;mathematical optimization;capacity optimization;network topology;computation;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;computer science;algorithm;spectral efficiency	HPC	32.66388909702738	91.16024327107777	93933

In this paper, an underlay SR model is proposed for an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) system to share the spectrum of a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) system through intelligently exploiting the interference margin provided by the CDMA system when operating with a low system load. The asymptotic signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the CDMA system is used to quantify the interference margin, which interestingly does not depend on the instantaneous information (spreading codes and channel state information) of the CDMA system, thanks to its internal power control. By using the transmit power constraints together with the derived interference margin, the uplink resource allocation problem for OFDMA system is formulated and solved through dual decomposition method. The proposed SR system only requires high level system parameters from the CDMA system, hence, the upgrading of legacy CDMA system is not needed. Simulation results have verified our theoretical analysis, and validated the effectiveness of the proposed resource allocation algorithm and its capability to protect the legacy CDMA users.	algorithm;channel state information;code;full-spectrum light;high-level programming language;interference (communication);lagrangian relaxation;load (computing);programming paradigm;radio resource management;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link	Shiying Han;Ying-Chang Liang;Boon-Hee Soong	2014	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2418196	channel allocation schemes;cellular network;electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;radio resource management;resource management;interference;cdma spectral efficiency;signal-to-noise ratio;fading;computer network	Mobile	32.741540996867506	92.17283235854542	94109
76de5985f1ce8c383e5b1b8787455e4a53abfb7f	a unified approach towards green resource allocation in relay-assisted multiuser networks		The rapid growth in energy consumption due to strong demands of wireless multimedia services, has become a major concern from an environmental perspective. In this paper, we investigate a novel energy-efficient resource allocation scheme for relay-assisted multiuser networks to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the network by jointly optimizing the subcarrier pairing permutation formed in one-to-many/many-to-one manner, subcarrier allocation, as well as the power allocation all together. By analyzing the properties of the complex mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, which is generally very difficult to solve in its original form, we transform the problem into an equivalent convex problem by relaxing the integer variables using the concept of subcarrier time sharing, and by applying a successive convex approximation approach. Based on the dual decomposition method, we derive an optimal solution to the joint optimization problem. Numerical results are provided to validate the theoretical findings and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.	algorithm;approximation;convex optimization;lagrangian relaxation;mathematical optimization;multi-user;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;numerical method;one-to-many (data model);optimization problem;relay;subcarrier;time-sharing	Keshav Singh;Ankit Gupta;Sudip Biswas;Tharmalingam Ratnarajah	2017	GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254216	decomposition method (constraint satisfaction);nonlinear programming;resource management;computer network;subcarrier;mathematical optimization;energy consumption;computer science;convex optimization;optimization problem;resource allocation	Robotics	31.82095810232395	92.23592622944645	94202

Having the choice of their power control policy, transmitters are concerned with energy constraints: instantaneous energy-efficiency and long-term energy consumption. The individual optimization of the average energy-efficient utility over a finite horizon is studied by using control theory and a coupled system of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Fleming equations is obtained. Even though the existence of a solution to the corresponding stochastic differential game is proven, the game is difficult to analyze when the number of transmitters is large (in particular, the Nash equilibrium analysis becomes hard and even impossible). But when the number of transmitters is large, the stochastic differential game converges to a mean-field game which is ruled by a more tractable system of equations. A condition for the uniqueness of the equilibrium of the mean-field game is given.	bellman equation;cobham's thesis;coefficient;control theory;game theory;interaction;jacobi method;mathematical optimization;nash equilibrium;numerical analysis;transmitter	François Mériaux;Samson Lasaulce	2011	International Conference on NETwork Games, Control and Optimization (NetGCooP 2011)		price of stability;bondareva–shapley theorem;implementation theory;minimax;mathematical optimization;example of a game without a value;simulation;extensive-form game;information set;repeated game;mathematics;stochastic game;screening game;normal-form game;zero-sum game;mathematical economics;algorithmic game theory;equilibrium selection;symmetric game;solution concept	Robotics	33.541292335482204	95.00991647249913	94503

We strictly prove that such a relaxation does not change the optimality for these subproblems. Then the global optimal solutions of the original non-convex problem can be obtained via a one-dimensional search.

The severe interference in the downlink from the femtocells should be controlled to guarantee the Quality of Service (QoS) required by the macrocell users. We used clustering method for grouping femtocells according to their geographical localizations. For this scenario, we proposed a hybrid scheme that combines both centralized and distributed schemes to minimize the total power consumption at femtocells, while guaranteeing the QoS of their users. Simulation results showed that our proposed power scheme can allocate power efficiently on the resource blocks in femtocells while obtaining a small performance reduction in femtocell compared to the fully distributed scheme. As well, our method minimized the signaling overhead compared to the fully centralized power allocation scheme.	algorithm;centralized computing;cluster analysis;compaq lte;constructive solid geometry;function-behaviour-structure ontology;interference (communication);overhead (computing);quality of service;rss;scheduling (computing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;software deployment;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;throughput;whole earth 'lectronic link	Reben Kurda;Tara Ali-Yahiya;Derya Yiltas-Kaplan;Pinar Kirci	2015	2015 14th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications (ITST)	10.1109/ITST.2015.7377401	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	Mobile	27.420831107474253	90.75257769284083	94552

Therefore, after proving the matroid structure of the underlying combinatorial optimization problem, we develop fast-implementable iterative greedy-type algorithms that converge to the desired optimal discrete loading.

f14a9fdbb15932bae04973cfb6282ed7cd8eaa82	optimal training design for mimo systems with general power constraints		Training design for general multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is investigated in this paper. Unlike prior designs that are applicable only for centralized MIMO systems with total power constraints, general power constraints are considered here. They cover total power constraints, individual power constraints, and mixed individual and per-user sum-power constraints as special cases. By writing the MIMO received signals in matrix and vector forms, respectively, and using Kronecker structured channel and noise statistics, three channel estimation schemes, i.e., right estimation, left estimation, and right-left estimation, are discussed. Their corresponding training designs are considered individually with the general power constraints. Under each channel estimation scheme, optimal training sequences to maximize the mutual information between the true channel and its estimated counterpart, and to minimize the mean square error (MSE) of the channel estimate are, respectively, proposed in semiclosed forms. The relationship between the two design criteria, i.e., the mutual information maximization and the MSE minimization, is clearly revealed. The optimal training designs under the three estimation schemes are also compared in depth. It is demonstrated that right estimation exploits less statistical information about the channel and noise, and provides worse performance than the left estimation but with lower computational complexity. On the other hand, right-left estimation performs in between the other two and provides a good compromise between complexity and performance. Finally, the optimality and effectiveness of the proposed training designs are verified by extensive simulations.	centralized computing;channel state information;computational complexity theory;expectation–maximization algorithm;mimo;mean squared error;mutual information;simulation	Shuai Wang;Shaodan Ma;Chengwen Xing;Shiqi Gong;Jianping An;H.

28468f8ca2a9da8333098d97282cfd4527aff524	joint stochastic geometry and mean field game optimization for energy-efficient proactive scheduling in ultra dense networks		In this paper, we investigate the energy efficiency performance of optimal proactive scheduling strategies in the context of ultra-dense networks. The network consists of a superposition of homogeneous Poisson point process, whereas the users requests follow a space-time homogeneous point process. The objective is to define the optimal transmission powers at any time, that allows to completely serve every user request, while minimizing the total consumed energy. We also assume the system has predictive knowledge about the future transmission contexts. The problem is cast as a dynamic stochastic game which is hard to solve in ultra-dense networks, due to a complex coupling in the interference term, the large number of elements interacting, as well as uncertainties on the channel dynamics, interference, and future requests. Our contribution first lies in addressing the inherent complexity issue of the optimization, by transitioning into an equivalent and more tractable mean field game. Second, we propose to combine this mathematical framework with elements of stochastic geometry. The numerical simulations provide good insights on notable performance gains in terms of energy efficiency, compared to reference scheduling strategies. Additional simulations harnessing the impact of future knowledge uncertainty on the performance of the proposed strategies are also provided.	algorithmic efficiency;bs 7799;centralized computing;cobham's thesis;combinatorial optimization;computation;computational complexity theory;docsis set-top gateway;distributed algorithm;heuristic (computer science);integrated development environment;interaction;interference (communication);loss function;mathematical optimization;multi-user;numerical analysis;point process;program optimization;quantum superposition;queueing theory;real-time computing;scheduling (computing);simulation;software deployment;transmission (bittorrent client);transmitter	Matthieu de Mari;Emilio Calvanese Strinati;M.

The exponential growth of mobile data traffic would lead to dense deployment of small base stations and eventually higher energy consumption in Fifth Generation (5G) wireless networks. We formulate a dynamic cell zooming and base stations sleep optimization algorithm for dense heterogeneous networks as a Linear Programming (LP) problem in order to not only minimize the system power consumption but also to guarantee the quality of service to end user. This is possible by optimally zooming the coverage area of macro base stations and small cells based upon real time traffic conditions. We characterize the optimal as well as provide an approximate solution, which, however, performs very closely to the optimum. The extensive performance evaluation of our proposed dynamic cell zooming algorithm shows that our proposed algorithm can significantly decrease both system energy consumption and outage probability.	approximation algorithm;cell (microprocessor);downtime;fifth generation computer;linear programming;mathematical optimization;performance evaluation;quality of service;software deployment;time complexity	Hafiz Yasar Lateef;Muhammad Zeeshan Shakir;Muhammad Ismail;Amr Mohamed;Khalid A.

We formulate two sparse beamforming techniques as ¿0-norm optimisation problems and apply a method that can replace ℓ0-norm with ℓ1-norm and iteratively updated the weight factors to obtain a sufficient sparsity solution called reweighted ℓ1-norm minimisation. For user-centric clustering technique, each user terminal selects a cluster of BSs, whereas, for BS-centric clustering technique, the BSs with a shortage of power budget are authorised to select an optimal number of user terminals based on their available energy budget. In both techniques, we investigate the optimal tradeoff between the BS-receiver cooperation links, the overall energy consumption by the BSs and the energy purchased by the retailer from the realtime market, whilst accounting for the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). Extensive simulation results confirm that the proposed sparse beamforming techniques significantly improve the infeasibility of a full cooperation in CoMP-SWIPT networks and reveal that the BS-centric clustering is more profitable than the user-centric clustering in real-time energy balancing.

fc275096df5b43b596d49d6722d73ddc0fe0ac4f	mobile edge computing for cellular-connected uav: computation offloading and trajectory optimization		This paper studies a new mobile edge computing (MEC) setup where an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is served by cellular ground base stations (GBSs) for computation offloading. The UAV flies between a given pair of initial and final locations, during which it needs to accomplish certain computation tasks by offloading them to some selected GBSs along its trajectory for parallel execution. Under this setup, we aim to minimize the UAV's mission completion time by optimizing its trajectory jointly with the computation offloading scheduling, subject to the maximum speed constraint of the UAV, and the computation capacity constraints at GBSs. The joint UAV trajectory and computation offloading optimization problem is, however, non-convex and thus difficult to be solved optimally. To tackle this problem, we propose an efficient algorithm to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution. Numerical results show that the proposed design significantly reduces the UAV's mission completion time, as compared to benchmark schemes.

We first establish a system model and a unified capacity maximization framework for a two-hop opportunistic relaying scheme where the source node (S) transmits signals to multiple relay nodes (R) in the first time slot, and the selected relay antennas and their corresponding relay nodes receive, decode and forward the messages to the destination (D) in the second time slot. Based on the system model, we develop a transmit antenna selection algorithm that maximizes the network capacity assuming that the channel state information is available at the receivers but not available at the transmitters, and total transmit power constraints are imposed on source/relay transmitters. The proposed algorithm first constructs a sorted list of relay antennas with decreasing S-R capacities, then iteratively maximizes the R-D capacity over a candidate antenna set using a low-complexity, near-optimal antenna selection scheme. The candidate set is reduced in the next iteration according to the selected antenna set of the current iteration. The overall network capacity is computed for the selected antenna sets of all iterations, and the set yielding the highest S-R-D capacity is the solution to the maximization problem. We show that this novel iterative algorithm achieves near-optimal solution and has a polynomial-time complexity. We also derive the lower and upper bounds of the achievable network capacity for both average capacity and outage capacity. Numerical examples show the significant performance gains obtained via the proposed scheme compared to its conventional counterparts.	broadcast relay station;brute-force search;channel capacity;channel state information;combinatorial optimization;computational complexity theory;condition number;downtime;expectation–maximization algorithm;iteration;iterative method;mathematical optimization;maximal set;np-hardness;numerical method;optimization problem;polynomial;selection algorithm;sorting algorithm;time complexity;transmitter;utility;whole earth 'lectronic link	Weiliang Zeng;Chengshan Xiao;Youzheng Wang;Jianhua Lu	2010	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2010.090210.091634	computer simulation;mathematical optimization;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;iterative method;relay channel;statistics	Mobile	34.95100514806013	90.21154936531892	96247

Assuming that the MBS protects itself by pricing the interference power from the femtocell users, the femtocell users set their transmission powers by competitively selecting the interference power fractions under the constraint of the total tolerable interference. The problem of femtocell users’ competitive interference occupation process is cast into a non-cooperative interference power purchase game, and the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium is proved. Then, a distributed interference power fraction iterative algorithm is developed to find the Nash equilibrium of the game, and the convergence analyses in both synchronous and asynchronous cases are presented. The distributed implementations are also shown. Simulation results show the convergence of the interference power fraction iterative algorithm and the effectiveness of the proposed interference control scheme.

Most existing works on JPAC assume the perfect instantaneous channel state information (CSI). In this paper, we consider the JPAC problem with the imperfect CSI, i.e., we assume that only the channel distribution information (CDI) is available. We formulate the JPAC problem into a chance (probabilistic)-constrained program, where each link's SINR outage probability is enforced to be less than or equal to a specified tolerance. To circumvent the computational difficulty of the chance SINR constraints, we propose to use the sample (scenario) approximation scheme to convert them into finitely many simple linear constraints. Furthermore, we reformulate the sample approximation of the chance SINR-constrained JPAC problem as a composite group sparse minimization problem and then approximate it by a second-order cone program (SOCP). The solution of the SOCP approximation can be used to check the simultaneous supportability of all links in the network and to guide an iterative link removal procedure (the deflation approach). We exploit the special structure of the SOCP approximation and custom-design an efficient algorithm for solving it.

Due to the need to accommodate both closed and open access subscribers, quality of service (QoS) provisioning for LTE-based hybrid access femtocells has become more challenging. This paper addresses this issue and proposes a new dynamic resource management scheme for such hybrid architectures. In particular, the proposed scheme first classifies and performs lexicographic admission control on the incoming traffic data flows using an optimal greedy algorithm. A suboptimal delay-bounded packet scheduling algorithm and a dual decomposition-based power allocation algorithm are developed to solve the non-convex maximization problem such that the weighted sum rate of each femtocell is maximized, subject to bounded packet delays and power constraints. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can significantly outperform existing schemes in terms of QoS, throughput and fairness.	compaq lte;entropy maximization;fairness measure;greedy algorithm;lagrangian relaxation;lexicography;network packet;paywall;provisioning;quality of service;scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput;weight function	Ying Loong Lee;Jonathan Loo;Teong Chee Chuah	2018	IEEE Systems Journal	10.1109/JSYST.2016.2569825	computer science;computer network;throughput;scheduling (computing);real-time computing;quality of service;greedy algorithm;network packet;cellular network;distributed computing;provisioning;femtocell	Metrics	28.300899012778668	93.70546683143708	96466

In particular, in a multi-user multiconcurrent-transmission network, effects of the resource sharing of a relay by its served users on the relay selection strategy need to be taken into account. There is little research on this investigation in literature. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient and fair relay selection strategy, in which individual user’s QoS requirement is inherently taken into account. In terms of efficiency, the proposed strategy is of low computational complexity. In terms of fairness, the system resource is utilized fairly among all relaying nodes so that the system has the best potential to accommodate as many users as possible. Simulation results indicate that the proposed selection strategy outperforms many existing ones, therefore justifying our arguments.

8d8bcbee011807429767f1bb43a130f3dbfde0d3	multi-channel resource allocation toward ergodic rate maximization for underlay device-to-device communications		In underlay device-to-device (D2D) communications, a D2D pair reuses the cellular spectrum causing interference to regular cellular users. Maximizing the performance of underlay D2D communications requires joint consideration for the achieved D2D rate and the interference to cellular users. In this paper, we consider the D2D power allocation optimization over multiple resource blocks (RBs), aimed at maximizing either the ergodic D2D rate or the ergodic sum rate of D2D and cellular users, under the long-term sum-power constraint of the D2D users and per-RB probabilistic signal-to-interference-and-noise (SINR) requirements for all cellular users. We formulate stochastic optimization problems for D2D power allocation over time. The proposed optimization framework is applicable to both uplink and downlink cellular spectrum sharing. To solve the proposed stochastic optimization problems, we first convexify the problems by introducing a family of convex constraints as a replacement for the non-convex probabilistic SINR constraints. We then present two dynamic power allocation algorithms: a Lagrange dual-based algorithm that is optimal but with a high computational complexity and a low-complexity heuristic algorithm based on dynamic time averaging. Through simulation, we show that the performance gap between the optimal and heuristic algorithms is small, and the effective long-term stochastic D2D power optimization over the shared RBs can lead to substantial gains in the ergodic D2D rate and the ergodic sum rate.	approximation algorithm;computation;computational complexity theory;convex hull;duality (optimization);ergodic theory;ergodicity;expectation–maximization algorithm;heuristic (computer science);interference (communication);mathematical optimization;memory management;optimization problem;power optimization (eda);requirement;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;stochastic optimization;subderivative;subgradient method;telecommunications link;throughput;transmitter	Ruhallah AliHemmati;Min Dong;Ben Liang;Gary Boudreau;S.

A reinforcement learning based resource assignment algorithm has been introduced to work in conjunction with the topology management scheme.

In this paper, an improved structure of Phantom cell heterogeneous networks (HetNets) is proposed to fulfil these requirements in the next generation cellular networks.It will be shown that the proposed orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) based structure can be employed in both indoor and outdoor environments by applying two individual frequency bands. Furthermore, the resource allocation problem of the proposed structure is investigated in downlink path. To this aim, a proper algorithm is presented in order to maximize the total throughput of all phantom cell users' equipments with regard to the protected minimum network capacity of the existing macrocell. To fulfil the objective goal, an iterative approach is employed in which OFDM subchannels and power transmitted by base stations are sequentially assigned and optimized at each step for every single frequency band. It is showed that the overall joint subchannel and power allocation algorithm converges to local maximum of the original designed problem. Performance improvement of the proposed algorithm is confirmed in both indoor and outdoor environments by numerical results.

This problem is formulated as a normal form noncooperative game. The utility function models inelastic demand. An example demonstrates that in the fading channel, in some networks, a pure strategy equilibrium does not exist with strictly positive probability. Hence, the probability of existence of an equilibrium is analyzed and bounds are computed. To this end, the problem of finding equilibria is transformed into a constraint satisfaction problem. Next the letter considers the incomplete information setting, with compact convex channel power gains. The resulting Bayesian game is proven to possess at least one pure Bayesian-Nash equilibrium in on-off threshold strategies.

Auction theory, as a subfield of economics and business management, has been introduced to provide an interdisciplinary technology for radio resource allocation (e.g., subchannels, time slots, and transmit power levels) in the wireless systems. By using various auction approaches, such radio resources are efficiently allocated among users and providers of services in the systems. Participants (i.e., users and providers) of an auction have their own strategies that follow the incentives and rules brought by the auction. Auction methods are widely employed in areas such as cognitive radio, cellular networks, and wireless mesh networks. This paper gives a comprehensive survey of recent auction approaches (i.e., auction-based applications and mechanisms) applied in wireless and mobile systems. First, auction theory and different types of auction are introduced. The motivation of using auction in wireless systems is given. Then, the reviews of auction approaches applied in the single-hop and multi-hop wireless networks are provided.

e07a2bc65e362026b997c2e86f222cf90c8c80e9	an adaptive learning based network selection approach for 5g dynamic environments		Networks will continue to become increasingly heterogeneous as we move toward 5G. Meanwhile, the intelligent programming of the core network makes the available radio resource be more changeable rather than static. In such a dynamic and heterogeneous network environment, how to help terminal users select optimal networks to access is challenging. Prior implementations of network selection are usually applicable for the environment with static radio resources, while they cannot handle the unpredictable dynamics in 5G network environments. To this end, this paper considers both the fluctuation of radio resources and the variation of user demand. We model the access network selection scenario as a multiagent coordination problem, in which a bunch of rationally terminal users compete to maximize their benefits with incomplete information about the environment (no prior knowledge of network resource and other users’ choices). Then, an adaptive learning based strategy is proposed, which enables users to adaptively adjust their selections in response to the gradually or abruptly changing environment. The system is experimentally shown to converge to Nash equilibrium, which also turns out to be both Pareto optimal and socially optimal. Extensive simulation results show that our approach achieves significantly better performance compared with two learning and non-learning based approaches in terms of load balancing, user payoff and the overall bandwidth utilization efficiency. In addition, the system has a good robustness performance under the condition with non-compliant terminal users.	access network;agent-based model;bandwidth (signal processing);converge;experiment;load balancing (computing);nash equilibrium;pareto efficiency;performance;quantum fluctuation;requirement;selection algorithm;simulation;throughput	Xiaohong Li;Ru Cao;Jianye Hao	2018	Entropy	10.3390/e20040236	robustness (computer science);mathematical optimization;real-time computing;reinforcement learning;dynamic bandwidth allocation;mathematics;heterogeneous network;load balancing (computing);core network;access network;adaptive learning	ML	24.90343883982462	96.89393371689864	97338

Based on measurements of a scalable video codec, concave and nonconcave utility functions are proposed. Two approaches to solving the utility maximization problem in a modular fashion are considered, one based on Lagrange duality, the other based on a projected gradient algorithm. Both methods yield the optimum solution for concave utilities. In the nonconcave case, simulation results show almost identical performance for both methods under the assumption that the dual solution is found. In contrast, the dual approach fails if the dual subproblems can only be solved to local optimality.	codec;concave function;convex function;duality (optimization);entropy maximization;euler–lagrange equation;expectation–maximization algorithm;gradient;heuristic;international ergonomics association;lagrangian relaxation;local convergence;local optimum;mathematical optimization;scalability;simulation;telecommunications link;utility	Johannes Brehmer;Wolfgang Utschick	2008	2008 6th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks and Workshops	10.4108/ICST.WIOPT2008.3207	algorithm design;mathematical optimization;duality;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications link;peak signal-to-noise ratio;telecommunications;interpolation;computer science;resource management;theoretical computer science;wireless network;mathematics;utility	Vision	35.14995134210861	91.34313441618033	97586

The secondary (or cognitive) network consists of a pair of single-antenna transceiver nodes and a non-regenerative two-way relay with multiple antennas which aids the communication process between the transceiver pair. The secondary nodes share the spectrum with a licensed primary user (PU) while guaranteeing that the interference to the PU receiver is maintained below a specified threshold. We consider two robust designs: the first is based on the minimization of the total transmit power of the secondary relay node required to provide the minimum quality of service, measured in terms of mean-square error (MSE) of the transceiver nodes, and the second is based on the minimization of the sum-MSE of the transceiver nodes. The robust designs are based on worst-case optimization and take into account known parameters of the error in the CSI to render the performance immune to the presence of errors in the CSI. Though the original problem is non-convex, we show that the proposed designs can be reformulated as tractable convex optimization problems that can be solved efficiently. We illustrate the performance of the proposed designs through some selected numerical simulations.	best, worst and average case;csi-dos;channel state information;cobham's thesis;cognitive network;cognitive radio;convex function;convex optimization;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);list of http status codes;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;numerical analysis;quality of service;relay;robustness (computer science);simulation;transceiver	P.

For a fault-tolerant cooperative spectrum sensing scheme, the most important issue is to distinguish whether the CR user is reliable or not. In this paper, a reputation-based cooperative mechanism is presented to alleviate the influence of the unreliable sensing results from CR users suffering shadowing and the false sensing data from malicious CR users on the detection result at the FC. In proposed fault-tolerant cooperative scheme, each cooperative CR user has a reputation degree which is initialized and adjusted by the FC and used to weight the sensing result from the corresponding user in the fusion process at the FC. And then, two reputation degree adjusting methods are presented to manage the reputation degree of each CR user. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can not only weaken the harmful influence caused by malicious CR users, but also alleviate the corrupted detection problem resulting from destructive channel condition between the primary transmitter and the CR user. Moreover, the detection performance of the fault-tolerant cooperative scheme, which has a feasible computational complexity and needs no instantaneous SNRs, is close to that of the optimal scheme.	cognitive radio	Huifang Chen;Ming Zhou;Lei Xie;Xu Jin	2013	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-012-0943-5	fault tolerance;cognitive radio;simulation;telecommunications;reputation;computer science;aerospace;computer security;computer network	Mobile	47.67115222838203	89.02789368301364	97638

Cooperative transmission has been recognized as one of the most effective paradigms to achieve higher system performance in terms of lower bit-error rate, higher throughput, larger coverage, more efficient energy utilization, and higher network reliability. This dissertation studies the location planning for the deployment of broadband access networks and explores the great potential of cooperative transmission in the context of single-cell cooperative relaying and multi-cell cooperative transmission, respectively. The placement problem is investigated in two categories of network deployment environment, i.e., an existing wireless access network and a perspective broadband access network, respectively. In an existing wireless access network, to solve some practical problems such as the requirements of capacity enhancement and coverage extension, relay stations (RSs) are introduced in the network architecture. We propose two optimization frameworks with the design objectives of maximizing cell capacity and minimizing number of RSs for deployment, respectively. Mathematical formulations are provided to precisely capture the characteristics of the placement problems. The corresponding solution algorithms are developed to obtain the optimal (or near-optimal) results in polynomial time. Numerical analysis and case studies are conducted to validate the performance benefits due to RS placement and the computation efficiency of the proposed algorithms.

Thus, new revolutionary solutions are needed to enhance their energy efficiency. In this paper, we propose an enhanced energy efficiency scheme for wireless systems based on sharing the energy between different cells to optimize the overall cost. The objective is to encourage cooperation between cells/micro-grids to exchange additional/needed power function of their respective throughput demand and energy availability. We propose a pricing scheme for the energy exchange and a power procurement and resource allocation strategy per operator to maximize the revenue of each operator. We derive analytic expressions for power procurement considering uniform power allocation over users. Then, we consider adaptive power allocation per user depending on channels and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements and propose a scheme to derive the global power procurement solution. Our simulation results show the feasibility of the proposed scheme allowing to enhance the energy efficiency of the hybrid powered wireless system while optimizing the revenue of the different involved operators.	interference (communication);marginal model;microgrid;procurement;quality of service;requirement;simulation;throughput;vii	Mahdi Ben Ghorbel;Mohsen Guizani;Amr Mohamed;Bechir Hamdaoui	2016	2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7842085	simulation;quality of service;procurement;computer science;resource management;wireless	EDA	26.04004801282168	92.49394831725829	97928

In this paper, we investigate multiple access scheduling methods for downlink orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in diffuse optical wire- less networks. Unlike the radio frequency (RF) channel, the DOW channel has low-pass filter characteristics and so requires different scheduling methods than those developed for the RF channel. Multi-user diversity orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems nominate a cluster of subcarriers with the largest signal-to-noise-ratio for transmission. However, in a DOW channel, most users would choose the lowest frequency clusters of subcarriers. To remedy this problem, we make two proposals. The first is to use a variable cluster size across the subcarriers; the lower frequency clusters will have fewer subcarriers while the higher frequency clusters will have more subcarriers. This will equalize the capacity of the clusters. The second proposal is to randomize a user's cluster selection from a group of clusters satisfying a minimum threshold. Through simulation it is shown that combining these strategies can increase the throughput while ensuring a fair distribution of the available spectrum.	frequency divider;low-pass filter;mimo-ofdm;multi-user;multiplexing;optical wireless;point-to-point protocol;radio frequency;scheduling (computing);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;subcarrier;telecommunications link;throughput;transmitter	Sarah Kate Wilson;JoAnne Holliday	2011	Journal of Communications and Networks	10.1109/JCN.2011.6157482	low-pass filter;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	30.48697920184511	89.60630618699966	98051

For multiuser cognitive radio systems, there exist two crucial issues in resource allocation: fairness and efficiency, in order to balance the two issues, we proposed a new utility-based cross-layer resource allocation algorithm, which can not only control the interference to primary users caused by secondary users, but also balance the spectral efficiency and fairness among cognitive users. Further, the optimal NP-hard resource allocation problem in multiuser OFDM-based systems is reduced to the sub-optimal solution by dividing the original problem into the subcarrier allocation problem and the power allocation problem. It is shown that the proposed algorithm can obtain the best performance in terms of the average rate or the utility among existing algorithms, and at the same time, all the users obtain fair resource allocation.

In order to gain non-asymptotic feasibility with minimal intervention, we first investigate a communication strategy that enables IA by feedforwarding a subset of messages with minimal rate. In a second step, we replace the proposed feedforward strategy by an analogous cyclic interference alignment and cancellation scheme with a backhaul network on the receiver side and also by its dual cyclic interference neutralization scheme with a backhaul network on the transmitter side.	backhaul (telecommunications);feedforward neural network;interference (communication);transmitter	Henning Maier;Rudolf Mathar	2014	2014 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW 2014)	10.1109/ITW.2014.6970798	telecommunications;control theory;mathematics	Mobile	42.13249893356274	89.09873971615882	98345
672ba6c3400ed9f2bc96a4a85d63c31b5848eb1e	a low-complexity algorithm for utility based spectrum coordination in dsl systems	sista	The static resource allocation which is usually assumed for the DSL physical layer leaves unused a significant portion of the achievable rate region. An alternative approach is to divide time into slots of short duration, and to change the resource allocation from each time slot to the next. A crosslayer scheduler then chooses a different resource allocation setting for each time slot by defining a utility function for each user n, and solving the corresponding network utility maximization (NUM) problem. For spectrum coordination, this NUM problem is non-convex and solving it is NP-Hard. This paper therefore introduces a fast algorithm, referred to as NUM-DSB, which converges to a local solution of the NUM problem. NUM-DSB can be applied to any NUM problem, regardless of the considered utility functions's characteristics. Simulation results show that NUM-DSB can compete with the state of the art algorithm for smooth non-convex network utility maximization.	convex function;digital subscriber line;entropy maximization;expectation–maximization algorithm;np-hardness;network utility;scheduling (computing);simulation	Jeroen Verdyck;Chris Blondia;Marc Moonen	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7952839	computer science	Robotics	31.496729622861984	92.24400489153291	98476

However, because of the diverse behavior of primary users (PU) in different spectrum bands, spectrum holes exhibit diverse characteristics, which in turn affect the performance of a learning algorithm. This paper studies the effect of the PU's activity on channel predictability. In particular, we introduce a Markov process-based learning algorithm, and we investigate the dependency of its spectrum decisions on the duty cycle (DC) and on the complexity of each channel activity, for both synthetic and real data. Our findings show that the probability of finding a free channel among a group of considered channels strongly depends on the DC and the complexity of the channel activity. Moreover, it is possible to reduce the number of observed channels without compromising the probability of finding a free channel, by only considering the more informative channels.	approximation algorithm;complexity;duty cycle;ibm systems network architecture;information;lz77 and lz78;one-class classification;synthetic intelligence	Hamed Ahmadi;Irene Macaluso;Luiz A.

0efac937e389cdb0cb8fbad73e0f99b3563c887f	incentive mechanism design for computation offloading in heterogeneous fog computing: a contract-based approach		Fog computing is a promising solution for new emerging applications requiring intensive computation resources and low latency. Devices at the edge of network can share idle resources and collaboratively accomplish the computing tasks in fog computing. Thus, task publishers have heterogeneous options when offloading computing tasks considering the quality of transmission links, energy consumption and other hardware constraints of fog nodes. To incentivize these devices to participate in computation offloading, effective incentive mechanisms are needed. In this paper, utilizing the framework of contract theory, we formulate the negotiation between task ublisher and fog nodes as an optimization problem. The optimal contract is the Nash equilibrium solution achieved by task publisher and fog nodes. Simulation results show that an optimal contract can maximize the utility of task publisher meanwhile guarantee the individual rationality and incentive compatibility of fog nodes. Therefore, edge devices can be incentivized effectively to involve in the computation offloading.	computation offloading;edge device;fog computing;mathematical optimization;nash equilibrium;optimization problem;rationality;simulation;theory	Ming Zeng;Yong Li;Ke Zhang;Muhammad Waqas;Depeng Jin	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2018.8422684	edge device;real-time computing;task analysis;incentive compatibility;latency (engineering);edge computing;computer science;idle;computation offloading;incentive	HPC	30.770047210986373	94.09725469113272	98583

A multiple-input single-output (MISO) primary link shares the spectrum with a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) secondary link, which in return acts as an amplify-and-forward (AF) relay, forwarding the primary message. The considered problem is the maximization of the secondary energy efficiency (EE) subject to a primary rate requirement. The resulting optimization problem is a fractional program which can not be tackled by traditional fractional optimization methods. Two algorithms are proposed, based on an interplay between fractional programming and sequential optimization theory, which trade-off performance and complexity. Numerical results demonstrate the merits of the proposed algorithms both in terms of energy-efficient performance and complexity.	algorithm;anisotropic filtering;cognitive radio;complexity;computational complexity theory;convex optimization;duplex (telecommunications);entropy maximization;first-order predicate;fractional programming;mimo;mathematical optimization;memory management;optimization problem;relay;system analysis	Alessio Zappone;Bho Matthiesen;Eduard Axel Jorswieck	2016	2016 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNCW.2016.7552685	programming;transmitter;3g mimo;telecommunications;computer science;statistics;computer network;mimo	Embedded	35.77404520655588	90.58030485060895	99145

The problem of non-cooperative SU downlink energy-efficiency is investigated using a game theoretic approach. We reformulate the EE optimization problem as a non-cooperative power allocation game (NPAG). A distributed power control algorithm is proposed to find the optimal power allocation strategy for each secondary base station on each subcarrier. The proposed non-cooperative game is demonstrated to reach a Nash-equilibrium (NE) point. Simulation analyses are then provided in order to validate the efficiency of our proposed distributed algorithm and also to highlight the advantages of using FBMC as a modulation technique if compared to OFDM.	cognitive radio;converge;distributed algorithm;expectation–maximization algorithm;filter bank;game theory;mimo-ofdm;mathematical optimization;modulation;multiplexing;nash equilibrium;numerical analysis;optimization problem;simulation;subcarrier;telecommunications link	Juwendo Denis;Mylene Pischella;Didier Le Ruyet	2016	2016 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2016.7564785	games;cognitive radio;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;interference;computer network;modulation	Robotics	33.2618065614076	91.70679720281078	99291

In this paper, we investigate joint source and relay precoding design based on the mean-square-error (MSE) criterion in MIMO two-way relay systems, where two multiantenna source nodes exchange information via a multiantenna amplify-and-forward relay node. This problem is non-convex and its optimal solution remains unsolved. Aiming to find an efficient way to solve the problem, we first decouple the primal problem into three tractable subproblems, and then propose an iterative precoding design algorithm based on alternating optimization. The solution to each subproblem is optimal and unique, thus the convergence of the iterative algorithm is guaranteed. Second, we propose a structured precoding design to lower the computational complexity. The proposed precoding structure is able to parallelize the channels in the multiple access (MAC) phase and broadcast (BC) phase. It thus reduces the precoding design to a simple power allocation problem. Last, for the special case where only a single data stream is transmitted from each source node, we present a source-antenna-selection (SAS)-based precoding design algorithm. This algorithm selects only one antenna for transmission from each source and thus requires lower signalling overhead. Comprehensive simulation is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of all the proposed precoding designs.	algorithm;broadcasting (networking);cobham's thesis;computational complexity theory;convex function;duality (optimization);iterative method;mimo;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;optimization problem;overhead (computing);relay;simulation;spectral efficiency	Rui Wang;Meixia Tao	2012	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2011.2178598	algorithm design;telecommunications;computer science;zero-forcing precoding;control theory;mathematics;precoding;statistics	EDA	38.93806216238303	88.66885656317731	99608

Heterogeneous networks are economical because both cell tiers share the same scarce and expensive spectrum. However, customers at cell edges experience severe cross-tier interference in channel sharing Het-Nets, resulting in poor service quality. Techniques for improving fairness globally have been developed in previous works. In this paper, a novel method for service differentiation at the level of individual customers is proposed. The proposed algorithm redistributes spectrum on a millisecond timescale, so that premium customers experience minimum downlink rates exceeding a target threshold. System level simulations indicate that downlink rate targets of at least 1 [Mbps] are always satisfied under the proposed scheme. By contrast, naive scheduling achieves the 1 [Mbps] target only 83% of the time. Quality of service can be improved for premium customers without significantly impacting global fairness metrics. Flexible service differentiation will be key to effectively monetizing the next generation of 5G wireless communications networks.	algorithm;data rate units;differentiated service;fairness measure;hall-effect thruster;interference (communication);monetization;multitier architecture;natural computing;network congestion;next-generation network;norm (social);quality of service;scheduling (computing);simulation;streaming media;telecommunications link;telecommunications network;time complexity	David Lynch;David Fagan;Stepán Kucera;Holger Claussen;Michael O'Neill	2018	2018 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)	10.1109/CEC.2018.8477871	artificial intelligence;computer science;machine learning;computer network;telecommunications link;wireless;quality of service;scheduling (computing);schedule;service quality;heterogeneous network;communication channel	Mobile	25.780414632451148	93.15576308987237	99661

Since the end-to-end sum rate maximization problem is intractable, we tackle a simplified problem where we maximize the sum of the harvested energy at the relays, we employ the block diagonalization (BD) procedure at the source, and we mitigate the interference between the relay- destination channels. The interference mitigation at the destinations is managed in two ways: either to fix the interference covariance matrices at the destination and update them at each iteration until convergence, or to cancel the interference using an algorithm similar to the BD method. We provide numerical results to show the relevance of our proposed solution.	algorithm;antenna farm;blu-ray;direction finding;end-to-end principle;entropy maximization;gaussian elimination;interference (communication);iteration;mimo-ofdm;multi-user mimo;numerical analysis;relay;relevance	Fatma Benkhelifa;Ahmed Kamal Sultan-Salem;Mohamed-Slim Alouini	2016	2016 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2016.7849055	telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	36.99811384000162	89.33402832399985	99792

They exhibit high energy efficiency, wide unlicensed communication bandwidth as well as innate security; hence, they may become part of future wireless systems. However, considering the limited coverage and dense deployment of light-emitting diode (LED) lamps, traditional network association strategies are not readily applicable to VLC networks. Hence, by exploiting the power of online learning algorithms, we focus our attention on sophisticated multi-LED access point selection strategies conceived for hybrid indoor LiFi-WiFi communication systems. We formulate a multi-armed bandit model for supporting the decisions on beneficially selecting LED access points. Moreover, the ‘exponential weights for exploration and exploitation’ algorithm and the ‘exponentially weighted algorithm with linear programming’ algorithm are invoked for updating the decision probability distribution, followed by determining the upper bound of the associated accumulation reward function. Significant throughput gains can be achieved by the proposed network association strategies.	algorithm;diode;linear programming;machine learning;multi-armed bandit;oled;reinforcement learning;software deployment;throughput;time complexity;tree accumulation;vlc media player;wireless access point	Jingjing Wang;Chunxiao Jiang;Haijun Zhang;Xin Zhang;Victor C.

The basic steps enabling self-optimization typically require listening to the environment, learning and adapting resource allocation consequently. In this work, we propose a joint optimization of sensing parameters and radio resource allocation in order to maximize the opportunistic throughput, under the constraint of limiting undue interference towards primary users. The method applies to wireless networks where the sensing nodes are allowed to cooperate to improve their local decision capabilities using a fully decentralized approach based on distributed consensus. The proposed optimization maximizes the opportunistic throughput, taking into account decision errors, sensing time and time necessary to achieve a consensus over the sensed variables. Because of the lack of knowledge of the channel between the cognitive users and the macro-users, the interference constraint is formulated in probabilistic form, depending on the spatial distribution of the nodes and on the channel fading model. Our formulation allows us to find the optimal false alarm rate and, consequently, the optimal decision thresholds jointly with the optimal power/bit allocation. Finally, we show that, given a total power budget constraint, there is an optimal way of distributing the available power between the power spent to achieve consensus and the power spent for transmitting the data payload.	approximation algorithm;chandra–toueg consensus algorithm;consensus (computer science);converge;convex optimization;digital subchannel;expectation–maximization algorithm;geometric graph theory;interference (communication);loss function;mathematical optimization;nash equilibrium;numerical analysis;optimization problem;point process;random geometric graph;self-organization;throughput;transmitter	Stefania Sardellitti;Sergio Barbarossa	2013	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2013.2267737	telecommunications;radio resource management;probability;mathematics;distributed computing;small cell;statistics;computer network	Mobile	27.542445580009925	89.7907084944089	99896

It is well-known that the user selection plays a crucial role in improving the performance of multiuser precoding with ZF and DPC. While the user selection criteria based on the sum-rate maximization are extensively studied for ZF and DPC, it is relatively not well investigated for the vector perturbation (VP) approach, which is known to be near optimal. In this paper, we derive a user selection criterion for VP and a greedy algorithm for the user selection in a multiuser system.	deferred procedure call;expectation–maximization algorithm;greedy algorithm;multi-user;telecommunications link;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding	Jinho Choi	2013	2013 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2013.6555075	mathematical optimization;greedy algorithm;multi-user mimo;telecommunications link;theoretical computer science;zero-forcing precoding;mathematics;precoding;encoding;statistics;mimo	DB	36.511912370463094	89.97951547756192	99988

It utilizes the same time-slots, frequency and spreadingcodes for all the users. It uses the power-domain and assign different power levels to users for multiple access. The uplink (UL) communication in the present 4G-Networks is performed by the base station (BS) that uses a request-grant mechanism in which a large-overhead and latency is produced. This issue will get more severe in upcoming 5G-Networks. For this purpose, a grant-free NOMA for UL communication, in which dynamic compressedsensing (DCS) algorithm will perform multi-user detection (MUD) as well as data-detection is proposed. It deploys the temporalcorrelation of active-user sets (AUS) in adjacent time-slots from which the estimated AUS is used as the prior-knowledge to estimate AUS in the next time-slot. For the downlink (DL) communication, the proposed system performance evaluation is performed using Rician fading-channels for Cooperative Relaying System (CRS) NOMA.

2411fd133d4e879e79bc0581019617ec4ddc42b0	spectrum sharing in energy harvesting cognitive radio networks: a cross-layer perspective		In the paper, we present a cross-layer perspective on data transmission in energy harvesting cognitive radio networks (CRNs). The delay optimal power allocation is studied while taking into account the randomness of harvested energy, data generation, channel state and the grid price. To guarantee primary user (PU)’s transmission, its Signal-Interference-Ratio (SIR) should be no less than a threshold. Each user, including PU as well as secondary user (SU), has energy harvesting devices, and the PU can also purchases the grid power. Each user is rational and selfish to minimize its own the buffer delay. We formulate a stochastic Stackelberg game in a bilevel manner. After decoupling via rewriting the objective and constraints, an equivalent tractable reconstruction is derived. First, we give a distributive algorithm to obtain the Nash equilibrium (NE) of the lower level SUs’ noncooperative stochastic game. Thereafter, the stochastic Stackelberg game is discussed under the circumstances that there is no information exchange between PU and SU. Distributed iterative algorithms are designed. Furthermore, a distributive online algorithm is proposed. Finally, simulations are carried out to verify the correctness and demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed algorithms.	cobham's thesis;cognitive radio;constraint (mathematics);correctness (computer science);coupling (computer programming);ibm systems network architecture;information exchange;interference (communication);iterative method;nash equilibrium;numerical method;one-class classification;online algorithm;online and offline;randomness;rewriting;simulation	Tian Zhang;Wei Chen	2016	CoRR		mathematical optimization;simulation;telecommunications;computer science	ECom	33.23895590128815	94.13399741371789	100260

However, decoupling the role of traditional ISPs into Infrastructure Providers (InPs) and Service Providers (SPs), also brings some new challenges to us. For example, how to fairly and efficiently share the sacred physical resources of InPs among multiple SPs is a key problem. The interaction between InPs and SPs, such as cooperation and competition, makes this topic even more complicated. In this paper, we develop a novel approach to encourage efficient behavior in solving the interaction between InPs and SPs by introducing economic incentives, in the form of Game Theory. Based on the non-cooperative game model, a bandwidth allocation scheme in the network virtualization environment is established, using the concept of the Nash Equilibrium. Then we propose an iterative algorithm to find the Nash Equilibrium and solve the bandwidth allocation problem. Finally, we demonstrate the convergence and the effectiveness of our scheme in the experiments.	algorithm;coupling (computer programming);experiment;game theory;hardware virtualization;iterative method;keystone effect;nash equilibrium	Ye Zhou;Yong Li;Guang Sun;Depeng Jin;Li Su;Lieguang Zeng	2010	2010 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference GLOBECOM 2010	10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5684331	service provider;game theory;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;distributed computing;computer network	Metrics	29.26809918266094	95.25746972750031	100319

Hence, reliable detection of available spectrum is foundation of cognitive radio technology. To ensure unimpaired operation of primary users, cooperative spectrum sensing is needed. To reduce the network overhead of cooperative spectrum sensing, a novel cooperative spectrum sensing algorithm based on credibility is proposed. In particular, the close-form expressions for probability of detection and false-alarm are derived for the novel algorithm, and expression for the average overhead used for cooperation is given.

The aim is to maximize a common data rate that can be offered to each user with a guaranteed maximum rate-outage probability. A target bit-error rate is also guaranteed with a maximum outage probability. The channel model takes into account the propagation path-loss in addition to log-normal shadowing and Rayleigh fading. The channel-state information available about each user corresponds to the shadowed path-loss that we define. We use the well-known frequency-reuse partitioning as an inter-cell interference mitigation technique. We suggest a simple threshold-based method for optimizing the reuse scheme. This method allows us to transform the considered optimization problem into a tractable one that we resolve numerically. Simulation results allows us to validate the proposed method and to compare the average achieved performance to that obtained with static BS-assignment and/or static frequency-reuse scheme.	algorithm;bit error rate;channel (communications);channel state information;cobham's thesis;data rate units;downtime;fairness measure;global variable;inter-protocol exploitation;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;modulation;numerical analysis;numerical method;optimization problem;overhead (computing);quality of service;rayleigh fading;scheme;simulation;sion's minimax theorem;software propagation;subcarrier;sun outage;telecommunications link;whole earth 'lectronic link;x.690	Ayman Alsawah;Inbar Fijalkow	2008	2008 IEEE 19th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2008.4699939	optimization problem;adjacent-channel interference;frequency allocation;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;quality of service;bit error rate;link adaptation;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;rayleigh fading;interference;shadow mapping;log-distance path loss model;fading;bandwidth;statistics;computer network	Embedded	32.41225917571968	89.17361852190983	100653
3b4e58e72dd8da03c5b98dea6959743c64c306c6	spectral efficiency of multi-user adaptive cognitive radio networks		In this correspondence, the comprehensive problem of joint power, rate, and subcarrier allocation have been investigated for enhancing the spectral efficiency of multi-user orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) cognitive radio (CR) networks subject to satisfying total average transmission power and aggregate interference constraints. We propose novel optimal radio resource allocation (RRA) algorithms under different scenarios with deterministic and probabilistic interference violation limits based on perfect and imperfect availability of cross-link channel state information (CSI). In particular, we propose a probabilistic approach to mitigate the total imposed interference on the primary service under imperfect cross-link CSI. A close form mathematical formulation of the cumulative density function (cdf) for the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is formulated to evaluate the resultant average spectral efficiency (ASE). Dual decomposition is utilized to obtain sub-optimal solutions for the non-convex optimization problems. Through simulation results, we investigate the achievable performance and the impact of parameters uncertainty on the overall system performance. Furthermore, we present that the developed RRA algorithms can considerably improve the cognitive performance whilst abiding to the imposed power constraints. In particular, the performance under imperfect crosslink CSI knowledge for the proposed ‘probabilistic case’ is compared over the conventional scenarios to show the potential gain in employing this scheme.	adaptive server enterprise;aggregate data;algorithm;artificial intelligence;catastrophic interference;channel state information;cognitive network;cognitive radio;convex optimization;interference (communication);lagrangian relaxation;mathematical optimization;multi-user;resultant;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;spectral efficiency;subcarrier;transmitter;while	H.

This paper makes a case for a macrocell femtocell overlay network that utilizes PNC to mitigate the UL interference at the HNB. In closed subscriber group (CSG) UL information exchange, a Macrocell User Equipment (MUE), especially situated at coverage area's edge of a macrocell nodeB (MNB), creates interference that could make the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratios (SINR) of the neighboring HNB to fall below the acceptable threshold. In a bid to ensure that the Service Quality (QoS) of femtocell and macrocell users are guaranteed, we propose to use PNC at the HNB by taking advantage of both the signals from the MUE and the Home User Equipment (HUE), rather than considering the signal from the MUE as interference. The paper develops the analytical expression of outage probability in closed-form, or equivalently the cummulative distribution function (CDF) for the received SINR of the proposed system is provided. Our results show that PNC is suitable for interference mitigation in femtocell network and it provides significant gain over the traditional scheme.	constructive solid geometry;downtime;information exchange;interference (communication);linear network coding;macrocell array;multitier architecture;overlay network;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;situated;telecommunications link	Wasiu Opeyemi Oduola;Lijun Qian;Xiangfang Li;Deepak Kataria	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommunications Systems (ANTS)	10.1109/ANTS.2013.6802849	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	Mobile	27.354896253998724	88.99933413380579	100722

BSC maximizes its gains over non-cooperation (NC) in a network wherein interference from cooperating BSs is the main limitation. However, at locations where the signals from non-cooperating BSs are the dominant interference, the gains are minimal. Therefore, for every user equipment, the set of cooperating BSs must be properly selected in order to achieve the potential gains of BSC in a cellular network. In this paper, various BSC cluster types and cell regions are introduced, and the impact of dynamic clustering on BSC spectral efficiency is discussed. It is shown that to maximize the spectral efficiency gains of BSC multi-user MIMO to a UE, the BSs which induce the strongest received signal powers must be selected for cooperation. Simulation results show that by performing dynamic clustering, the geographical area at which BSC achieves better spectral efficiency over NC can be significantly increased over that of static clustering.	agile software development;assistive technology;binary symmetric channel;cluster analysis;compaq lte;geographic coordinate system;interference (communication);multi-user mimo;scheduling (computing);simulation;spectral efficiency;unreal development kit	Ian Dexter Garcia;Naoki Kusashima;Kei Sakaguchi;Kiyomichi Araki	2010	21st Annual IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2010.5671660	telecommunications;computer science;base station;computer network	Mobile	28.196496839069216	89.13426092197804	100949

With this respect, we study the effect of joint routing, spreading code and power allocation on the network throughput. A solution for joint routing and spread-spectrum channelization is proposed as a localized approximation of the throughput-maximizing problem. Specifically, power and spreading code are allocated to guarantee the quality of service of the on-going primary and secondary transmissions, while the routing algorithm dynamically selects relays based on the network traffic dynamics and on the achievable data rates on different secondary links.	algorithm;approximation;channelization (telecommunications);coexist (image);cognitive network;cognitive radio;constrained optimization;constraint (mathematics);convex function;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;hoc (programming language);interaction;interdependence;mathematical optimization;np-hardness;network packet;optimization problem;quality of service;relay;routing;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;throughput	Kanke Gao;Lei Ding;Tommaso Melodia;Stella N.

In our previous work, we formulated the joint control problem as a sparse ℓ0-minimization problem and relaxed it to a ℓ1-minimization problem. In this work, we propose to approximate the ℓ0-optimization problem by a p norm minimization problem where 0 <; p <; 1, since intuitively p norm will approximate 0 norm better than 1 norm. We first show that the ℓp-minimization problem is strongly NP-hard and then derive a reformulation of it such that the well developed interior-point algorithms can be applied to solve it. The solution to the ℓp-minimization problem can efficiently guide the link's removals (deflation).

We first define a utility function at each sector aiming at maximizing sum of average SINR, and implement the fairness factor which enables the resource allocator to schedule resources fairly among the users. Then, for the fairness-aware utility function, the optimization problem is solved using the iterative Hungarian. In multi-cell system, as the users suffer a uncorrelated inter-cell interference, it is difficult to find the globally optimal radio resource allocation. We propose a distributed allocation method which avoids the drastic interference level changes. Results exhibit that the proposed allocation method has a robustness to the interference variation and can be close to the globally optimal allocation.	fairness measure;hungarian algorithm;ici (programming language);interference (communication);iterative method;local optimum;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;meltwater entrepreneurial school of technology;optimization problem;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;telecommunications link;utility	Jung-Hoon Noh;Seong-Jun Oh	2009	2009 IEEE 70th Vehicular Technology Conference Fall	10.1109/VETECF.2009.5378857	optimization problem;throughput;electronic engineering;real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;max-min fairness;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;resource management;static memory allocation;mathematics;interference;iterative method;signal-to-noise ratio;fading;bandwidth;global optimization	Robotics	32.54497896287704	90.58363879923112	101402
2bab8306a06173a4c07c016839fcf690b29d97dc	sequential incomplete information game in relay networks based on wireless physical layer network coding		A performance of a network based onWireless Physical Layer Network Coding (WPLNC) crucially depends on local mapping functions selected by every individual relay. As a whole the mappings must enable the destination to recover desired source data but they must also be reasonable from relays’ point of view. This is important especially in distributed and decentralised networks where the relays’ mappings are not given in advance but they emerge from interaction among relays. In this paper we focus on a toy example of relay network where a sequential selection of the WPLNC mappings takes place. We assume that the first relay may suffer from low battery level which may affect its selection of WPLNC mappings and that the second relay can deduce the battery state from observed actions and alter its behaviour to cope with the situation. For this scenario we discuss and evaluate an existence of game equilibria.	linear network coding;relay;source data	Tomas Hynek;Jan Sýkora	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-23440-3_4	telecommunications;distributed computing;computer network	AI	33.53727498947587	96.97450426021018	101480

The secrecy sum rate is used as the metric of security, which is the rate difference between the legitimate information exchange between the terminals and the information leakage to the eavesdropper. We propose two-phase analog network coding (ANC) and power allocation scheme for the relay nodes and terminals to enhance the security of the data exchange. Three different schemes are proposed. The first scheme is the optimal ANC to achieve the maximum secrecy sum rate, i.e. secrecy capacity, which is found to be mathematically difficult to solve. Two suboptimal schemes are proposed with and without the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) of the eavesdropper, respectively. The solutions of both schemes are shown to be unique and globally optimum, which are solved by convex optimization techniques. Numerical evaluation results of the obtained secrecy sum rate and transmit power are provided and analyzed to show the properties and efficiency of the proposed ANCs.	channel state information;convex optimization;information exchange;information leakage;linear network coding;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;rayleigh–ritz method;relay;spectral leakage;two-phase commit protocol;two-phase locking	Huiming Wang;Qinye Yin;Xiang-Gen Xia	2011	2011 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference - GLOBECOM 2011	10.1109/GLOCOM.2011.6134383	data exchange;linear network coding;convex optimization;quality of service;information exchange;telecommunications;computer science;noise;channel state information;physical layer;statistics;computer network	Mobile	37.41197400442139	89.79197241633264	101604

To allocate the resource more effectively, we propose a novel algorithm from the perspective of both time domain and power domain. On the one hand, we propose an adaptive Almost Blank Subframe (ABS) configuration scheme to dynamically match the network resources with the real-time load. On the other hand, we propose a utility function of macrocells' power control and a corresponding scheduling scheme to make a tradeoff between the two-tier macro-pico networks and protect the victim users as well. The existence of the optimal solution to the problem is proved, and Differential Evolution (DE) is applied to find the optimal solution. System level simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can not only enhance the load balance between macrocell and picocell, but also provide a great improvement on the performance of edge users with little overall throughput cost.	algorithm;differential evolution;load balancing (computing);multitier architecture;pico;power domains;real-time clock;scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput;utility	Hao Zhou;Hailun Xia;Caili Guo;Rui Han;Yaguang Wu	2014	2014 IEEE 80th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2014-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2014.6965851	electronic engineering;real-time computing;engineering;computer network	Embedded	27.89026808307874	91.14858556199343	102030

A Stackelberg game is formulated to model the interactions between the BS and D2D users. Specifically, the BS sets prices to a maximize its revenue subject to an interference temperature constraint. For given specified prices, the D2D users competitively adapt power allocation strategies for their individual utility maximization. We first analyze the competition among the D2D users by noncooperative game theory and an iterative based distributed power allocation algorithm is proposed. Then, depending on how much network information the BS knows, we develop two pricing algorithms, i.e., uniform pricing with limited network information and differentiated pricing with global network information.	aggregate data;entropy maximization;expectation–maximization algorithm;frequency response;game theory;global network;interaction;interference (communication);iteration;iterative method;multitier architecture	Yuan Liu;Suili Feng	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2014.6884153	simulation;telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	30.966976327311766	94.72577865903091	102321

Auction is an efficient way to allocate resources to those who value them the most. The large pool of spectrums to be released, especially the ones in TV Whitespace, consist of wide-range frequencies. Apart from spatial reuse, spectrum heterogeneity imposes new challenges for spectrum auction design: 1) Wireless service providers with different targeted cell coverages have different spectrum frequency preferences; 2) interference relationship is frequency-dependent due to frequency-selective signal fading. Unfortunately, existing spectrum auction mechanisms either assume spectrum valuation is homogeneous or use homogeneous interference graph to group buyers who can reuse the same spectrum. In this paper, we propose TAMES, an auction framework for heterogeneous spectrum transaction. We consider a multi-seller-multi-buyer double auction, in which every buyer submits a bid, consisting of the spectrum demand and a bidding profile of prices for spectrums contributed by all sellers. A novel buyer grouping approach is proposed to tackle the problem of heterogeneous interference graph. TAMES is proved to be truthful as well as individually rational. The simulation results show that TAMES significantly improves spectrum utilization, sellers' revenue and buyers' utility by making smart use of spectrum heterogeneity, while keeping low running time comparable with existing auction mechanisms. Moreover, via simulation, we show how to help buyers obtain continuous spectrums which further improves buyers' satisfaction.	communications satellite;interference (communication);simulation;spectrum analyzer;time complexity;value (ethics)	Yanjiao Chen;Jin Zhang;Kaishun Wu;Qian Zhang	2014	IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems	10.1109/TPDS.2013.294	spectrum auction;auction algorithm;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;operating system;revenue equivalence;interference;double auction;auction theory;wireless;cost accounting;forward auction	Mobile	30.08817906330329	95.66378959275602	102536

In this paper we consider a coordinated beamforming approach whereby multiple base stations jointly optimize their downlink beamforming vectors in order to simultaneously improve the data rates of a given group of cell edge users. Assuming perfect channel knowledge, we formulate this problem as the maximization of a system utility function (which balances user fairness and average user rates), subject to individual power constraints at each base station. We show that, for the single carrier case and when the number of antennas at each base station is at least two, the optimal coordinated beamforming problem is strongly NP-hard for both the harmonic mean utility function and the proportional fairness utility function. For the min-rate utility function, we show that the problem is solvable in polynomial time.	beamforming;decision problem;entropy maximization;fairness measure;interference (communication);maxima and minima;proportionally fair;telecommunications link;time complexity;utility	Ya-Feng Liu;Yu-Hong Dai;Zhi-Quan Luo	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2010.5496027	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;base station;signal processing;harmonic analysis;mathematics	Mobile	33.428023116324084	90.57922679152087	102648

On the other hand, Energy Harvesting (EH) technologies are increasingly adopted due to sustainability and economic advantages. Power consumption due to baseband processing has a huge share in the total power consumption breakdown of smaller base stations. Given that such base stations are powered by EH, in addition to QoS constraints, energy availability also conditions the decision on where to place each baseband function in the system. This work focuses on determining the performance bounds of an optimal placement of baseband functional split option in virtualized small cells that are solely powered by EH. The work applies Dynamic Programming (DP), in particular, Shortest Path search is used to determine the optimal functional split option considering traffic QoS requirements and available energy budget.	baseband;dynamic programming;exception handling;mathematical optimization;online optimization;phy (chip);pathfinding;quality of service;radio access network;requirement;search algorithm;shortest path problem;simulation	Dagnachew Azene Temesgene;Nicola Piovesan;Marco Miozzo;Paolo Dini	2018	CoRR		computer network;dynamic programming;quality of service;radio access network;energy harvesting;distributed computing;computer science;cloud computing;shortest path problem;base station;baseband	Embedded	25.156431692545816	92.79625564170111	102825

The resource allocation algorithm aims to maximize the CR network throughput under PUs interference constraints. In this paper, CR interference introduced into PUs sub-bands is modeled as a composite of two parts; CR Out-of-Band (OOB) emissions and the interference arising as a result of imperfect spectrum sensing. The uplink subcarrier and power allocation is a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem, for which obtaining the optimal solution is known to be NP-Hard. In this paper, we propose a three steps heuristic solution to the uplink resource allocation problem. We show through simulation that the proposed algorithm exhibits near-optimal performance and comes with a significant reduction in computational complexity when compared to that of obtaining the optimal solution.	algorithm;cognitive radio;computational complexity theory;generalized assignment problem;heuristic;interference (communication);np-hardness;nonlinear programming;out-of-bag error;out-of-band agreement;simulation;subcarrier;telecommunications link;throughput	Sami M.

In this paper, we particularly focus on linear relay filter designs that effectively minimize the mean square error of SUs while providing a certain level of quality of service for the primary network. To this end, we first propose an iterative algorithm that identifies a solution based on an alternating optimization technique. Then, a closed-form relay filter design is presented, which employs a high signal-to-noise ratio approximation to reduce the computational complexity. Through the simulation results, we confirm that the proposed closed-form relay filter design outperforms conventional approaches and provides the performance close to the proposed iterative algorithm with much reduced complexity.	algorithm;approximation;computational complexity theory;filter design;iterative method;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;multi-user;quality of service;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Haewook Park;Chang-Ick Song;Hoon Lee;Inkyu Lee	2015	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2014.2331245	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;quality of service;computer science;theoretical computer science;iterative method;relay channel;signal-to-noise ratio;computer network	EDA	38.29478040868612	89.13812196102162	103565
1c6faca12baa33e45ca5dcfb33d1b5225699dc94	an efficient location aware distributed physical resource block assignment for dense closed access femtocell networks	energy efficiency;macro femto cellular network;resource allocation;power control	The demand for higher data-rate in the indoor environment is unrelenting, and has triggered a huge deployment of Femto Base Stations (FBSs) in such environments. A large portion of these FBSs are privately owned and operate in closed access mode. However, due to aggressive spectrum reuse among these FBSs, co-tier interference is very high. Techniques relying on Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR) will not scale in these dense FBS networks as the effective available spectrum per FBSs will be a little to support any meaningful data-rate at any FBS. Moreover, the techniques that use both power control and sub-channel allocation usually operate in a centralized fashion. Hence, these are a huge burden to the entire system. To handle this additional interference without significantly affecting spectrum efficiency, efficient location aware Physical Resource Block (PRB) assignment among interfering FBSs is necessary. In this paper, we formulate the PRB assignment problem as a Mixed Integer Non-Linear Program (MINLP) that exploits User Equipment (UE) location with respect to its interfering FBSs. Since the optimization problem is NP-hard, we propose a twofold solution which can efficiently reuse the PRBs while maintaining the interference below a threshold. First, an iterative elimination algorithm for PRB allocation and second, an adaptive PRB power control to find the required transmission power which minimizes interference. The proposed technique operates in a distributed manner and improves per FBS PRB reuse, energy efficiency, system blocking. Obtained results are verified using extensive simulations. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

f833d6259d7bacd5cefe5aed1ebb221795a2dbe7	resource allocation for weighted sum-rate maximization in multi-user full-duplex device-to-device communications: approaches for perfect and statistical csis		In this paper, we investigate the resource allocation problem for multi-user full-duplex device-to-device (D2D) underlay communication, considering both perfect channel state information (CSI) and statistical CSI scenarios. In perfect CSI scenario, the weighted sum-rate maximization problem under cellular users’ minimum rate constraints is formulated as a mixed integer programming problem. To solve the challenging problem, we decouple it into two subproblems as power allocation and channel assignment. Then we proposed a power allocation algorithm based on difference of two convex functions programming and a channel assignment algorithm based on Kuhn–Munkres algorithm, respectively. In statistical CSI scenario, we formulate the resource allocation problem as an outage probability constrained weighted ergodic sum-rate maximization problem. To solve the problem, the closed-form expressions of outage probability and weighted ergodic sum-rate are derived first. Then we decouple resource allocation problem into power allocation and channel assignment. An optimization solution that consists of a 2-D global searching and Kuhn–Munkres algorithm is then developed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can improve the weighted sum-rate of full-duplex D2D communications significantly both in perfect CSI and statistical CSI scenarios and confirm the accuracy of our derived closed-form expressions.	channel state information;convex function;downtime;duplex (telecommunications);ergodicity;expectation–maximization algorithm;genetic algorithm;integer programming;linear programming;mathematical optimization;multi-user;simulation;weight function	Song Li;Qiang Ni;Yanjing Sun;Geyong Min	2017	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2751084	channel state information;duplex (telecommunications);telecommunications link;distributed computing;mathematical optimization;channel allocation schemes;maximization;integer programming;communication channel;resource allocation;mathematics	EDA	35.51203735293672	90.26779934273695	104361

Challenges come with the reuse of the limited frequency resource for improving spectral efficiency, which always introduces serious mutual inter- and intracell interference between or among small cells and macrocells. The opportunities refer to more potential chances of inter- and intratier cooperations among small cells and macrocells. Energy efficiency will be a critical performance requirement for future green communications, especially when small cells are densely deployed to enhance the quality of user's experience. We exploit the potential cooperation diversities to combat the interference and energy management challenges. To capture the complicated interference interaction and also the possible coordination behavior among small cells and macrocells, this paper proposes a novel bargaining cooperative game (BCG) framework for energy efficient and interference-aware power coordination in a dense small cell network. In particular, a new adjustable utility function is employed in the BCG framework to jointly address both the spectral efficiency and energy efficiency issues. Using the BCG framework, we then derive the closed-form power coordination solutions and further propose a joint interference-aware power coordination scheme (Joint) with the considerations of both interference mitigation and energy saving. Moreover, a simplified algorithm (Simplified) is presented to combat the heavy signaling overhead, which is one of the significant challenges in the scenario of extensive deployment of small cells. Finally, numerical results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed Joint and Simplified schemes.	algorithm;coefficient;game theory;interaction;interference (communication);mathematical model;multi-agent system;numerical analysis;overhead (computing);simulation;software deployment;spectral efficiency;utility	Chungang Yang;Jiandong Li;Alagan Anpalagan;Mohsen Guizani	2016	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2015.2489215	telecommunications;radio resource management;computer network	Mobile	26.604040392598154	90.70944305126457	104418

BSs are connected to the non-renewable energy source used by a BS when it cannot harvest enough energy to serve its connected users. A double auction trading framework is proposed to motivate BSs with the extra harvested energy to share their surplus energy with BSs that have not harvested sufficient energy. In addition, BSs with energy deficit are stimulated to buy surplus energy of other BSs which results in reducing of the non-renewable energy consumption. The algorithm satisfies truthfulness, individual rationalities and budget balance. Moreover, it reaches the Nash equilibrium. The extra harvested energy is distributed by the smart grid that prevents energy accumulation which results in the waste of the harvested energy due to limited battery capacities. To reduce smart grid usage in distributing energy, an optimization is embodied in the proposed algorithm to assign BSs with energy deficit to near BSs with extra harvested energy. Simulations results show that the non-renewable energy consumption reduces dramatically when the algorithm is applied. In addition, BSs gain more profit, consequently, their utility functions enhance.	algorithm;centralized computing;computer simulation;mathematical optimization;multitier architecture;nash equilibrium;tree accumulation	Navid Reyhanian;Behrouz Maham;Vahid Shah-Mansouri;Chau Yuen	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2016.7511350	stochastic process;simulation;telecommunications;electrical engineering;smart grid;energy harvesting;statistics	Robotics	31.408642134710394	95.5129530616864	104436

Dynamic resource allocation is essential to guarantee quality of service (QoS) and enhance the network performance. We propose a novel resource allocation framework to cope with the time-varying channel conditions, co-channel interferences, and different QoS requirements in various kinds of services. We define a QoS measurement for delay sensitive applications. We introduce a credit system, where users have their autonomy to decide when and how to use their resources, and users can borrow or lend resources from the system. We also develop a simple feedback mechanism to report the system with the users’ QoS satisfaction levels and channel conditions. Then the system will adapt its resource allocation strategy according to the users’ feedbacks to favor the users with the bad QoS satisfaction levels or the good channels. We develop adaptive algorithms at both the user and system levels. From simulations, the proposed algorithms efficiently allocate the resources to different types of users. The users’ delay constraints are satisfied and the links can survive under a long period of bad channels.	adaptive algorithm;autonomy;network performance;quality of service;requirement;simulation	Zhu Han;Z.

In doing so, we keep the outage probability of users below their predefined threshold with minimal power consumption. To reduce the complexity, we apply the notion of chance constraint robust optimization to the outage probability. This approach preserves the convexity of the problem and maintains its tractability. For solving the reformulated problem, a distributed probabilistic robust power algorithm is developed based on the standard interference function and local convergence, which utilizes infrequent message passing. We derive the conditions for the convergence of our algorithm, and prove the optimality of the equilibrium.	algorithm;convex function;downtime;interference (communication);local convergence;mathematical optimization;message passing;randomness;robust optimization;robustness (computer science)	Saeedeh Parsaeefard;Ahmad R.

Meanwhile, the existing resource allocation algorithms bring about high complexity and large overhead. By tracking channel variation as well as arrival and departure of users, we propose a hybrid centralized/distributed resource allocation algorithm to maximize the number of GP users, with lower complexity and smaller overhead. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the system performance compared to the existing algorithms such as Q-FCRA.	algorithm;backhaul (telecommunications);cell (microprocessor);centralized computing;computational complexity theory;elegant degradation;ici (programming language);interference (communication);memory management;overhead (computing);quality of service;simulation;telecommunications link;throughput	Kan Wang;Yinghong Ma;Hongyan Li;Peng Liu;Hongguang Sun;Hao Zhang	2013	2013 IEEE 78th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2013.6692059	adjacent-channel interference;real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;computer network	Mobile	27.973691005726565	90.45477180417329	105151

The proposed algorithm is rooted in the homotopy continuation techniques commonly used to solve systems of nonlinear equations. Homotopy methods find the solution of a target system by smoothly deforming the known solutions of a start system which can be trivially solved. The key observation leading to a simple start system is realizing that the inverse IA problem, i.e, finding the channels that satisfy the IA conditions given a set of precoders and decoders, is linear and, therefore, a convenient trivial system. Once the start system has been solved, standard prediction and correction techniques are applied to track the solution all the way to the target system. Our results show that the proposed algorithm is able to consistently find solutions achieving the maximum number of degrees of freedom (DoF) whereas alternating minimization techniques, which typically work well for the interference channel (IC), repeatedly fail for the XN. Further, the algorithm provides insights into the feasibility of alignment in MIMO X networks for which theoretical results are scarce.	algorithm;apollonian network;interference (communication);mimo;nonlinear system;numerical continuation;smoothing	Oscar Gonzalez;Jacobo Fanjul;Ignacio Santamaría	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6854794	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;machine learning;control theory;mathematics;interference;degrees of freedom;statistics	EDA	42.15958539859904	89.20467419183574	106134

c768229dbd77a7dda6c32289d52c06d8b11ee706	the rival might be not smart: revising a cdma jamming game		Due to the shared and open-access nature of the wireless medium, wireless networks are vulnerable to interference in the form of jamming attacks. In the research literature, game theory is a commonly employed tool to describe such jammming attacks as well as to design anti-jamming (defense) strategies. An advantage of such an approach is that it allows one to consider the adversary as a smart agent, who flexibly responds to the action of the other agents. In this paper, we put forward a question: what happen if the rival is smart? How does a priori knowledge about this impact on the rivals strategies. We formulate a jamming problem in a CDMA-style network as a Bayesian game between a jammer and a user with two-sided incomplete information about the type of rival it faces. We prove that the equilibrium exists and is unique. Closed form criteria to establish whether the equilibrium is an inner or boundary equilibrium is established. We derive monotonicity properties for the superposition of the two best response strategies, which allows us to develop an algorithm based on the bisection method to find the fixed point (i.e. equilibrium) of this superposition of best response strategies. Our algorithm can be considered as a learning algorithm since it allows to reduce the zone of uncertainty for the equilibrium by a half per iteration.	adversary (cryptography);algorithm;bisection method;electronic counter-countermeasure;fixed point (mathematics);game theory;interference (communication);iteration;malware;radio jamming;scientific literature	Andrey Garnaev;Wade Trappe	2018	2018 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2018.8377296	real-time computing;complete information;wireless network;game theory;bayesian game;best response;mathematical optimization;adversary;fixed point;bisection method;computer science	ECom	34.63281544404709	96.37674465787704	106741
1a72984e65df62b8f9082a429333992afb5fd682	downlink energy efficiency of power allocation and wireless backhaul bandwidth allocation in heterogeneous small cell networks		The widespread application of wireless services and dense devices access has triggered huge energy consumption. Because of the environmental and financial considerations, energy-efficient design in wireless networks has become an inevitable trend. To the best of our knowledge, energy-efficient orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) heterogeneous small cell optimization comprehensively considering energy efficiency maximization, power allocation, wireless backhaul bandwidth allocation, and user quality of service is a novel approach and research direction, and it has not been investigated. In this paper, we study the energy-efficient power allocation and wireless backhaul bandwidth allocation in OFDMA heterogeneous small cell networks. Different from the existing resource allocation schemes that maximize the throughput, the studied scheme maximizes energy efficiency by allocating both transmit power of each small cell base station to users and bandwidth for backhauling, according to the channel state information and the circuit power consumption. The problem is first formulated as a non-convex nonlinear programming problem and then it is decomposed into two convex subproblems. A near optimal iterative resource allocation algorithm is designed to solve the resource allocation problem. A suboptimal low-complexity approach is also developed by exploring the inherent structure and property of the energy-efficient design. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms by comparing with the existing schemes.	algorithm;backhaul (telecommunications);channel state information;entropy maximization;frequency divider;iterative method;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;quality of service;simulation;telecommunications link;throughput	Haijun Zhang;Hao Liu;Julian Cheng;Victor C.

cf76dc103d4661198657fda017e2c1020af651b6	a coalition formation game based relay selection scheme for cooperative cognitive radio networks	cognitive radio networks;cooperative communication;multi-relay selection;coalition formation game	In a cognitive radio network, cooperative communications between a primary user (PU) and a second user (SU) may be able to significantly improve the spectrum utilization, and thus, the network performance. To be specific, the PU can select a number of SUs as its relays to cooperatively transmit its data. In turn, these relays can be granted access to the licensed channel of the PU to transmit their data. In this paper, an effective cooperation strategy for SUs is presented. We formulate the problem of cooperative relay selection as a coalition formation game, and develop a utility function based on the game. The utility function considers various factors such as transmission power and noise level. With the utility function, a distributed coalition formation algorithm is proposed, which can be used by SUs to decide whether to join or leave a coalition. Such a decision is based on whether it can increase the maximal coalition utility value. We rigorously prove that our proposed coalition formation algorithm can terminate and reach a stable state. Finally, this paper demonstrates that the proposed scheme is able to enhance the network throughput via a simulation study.	cognitive radio;relay	Yan Huo;Lingling Liu;Liran Ma;Wei Zhou;Xiuzhen Cheng;Tao Jing;Xiaobing Jiang	2017	Wireless Networks	10.1007/s11276-016-1298-8	computer network;throughput;cognitive radio;network performance;computer science;relay;distributed computing;communication channel	Mobile	33.08197361513619	95.36939581615529	106880

Recent research has proposed many effective methods for cross-tier interference mitigation, but unfortunately, the optimal spectrum access scheme remains unknown. In this paper, a cognitive spectrum access scheme is proposed, where each femtocell can dynamically explore and access the idle macro-tier spectrum besides its dedicated femto-tier spectrum. The optimum probabilities for each femtocell to access the femto-tier and idle macro-tier spectrum which maximize the area spectral efficiency (ASE) are investigated. With perfect spectrum sensing, the ratio between the optimum probabilities to access the femto-tier and macro-tier spectrum is equal to the amounts of available subchannels in the femto-tier and macro-tier spectrum for most cases. With non-perfect spectrum sensing, a lower bound of the optimum probability to access the femto-tier spectrum is determined, which is a piecewise function of the femtocell intensity. Simulation results validate the accuracy of our analytical results and reveal the advantages of the proposed scheme over existing schemes.	adaptive server enterprise;interference (communication);maxima and minima;multitier architecture;simulation;spectral efficiency	Lu Hong Yang;Shenghui Song;Khaled Ben Letaief	2014	2014 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7037478	cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;interference;femtocell;wireless;computer network	Mobile	27.911555881589223	89.76725024629584	106909

Such an aggressive reuse of spectral resources increases the level of co-channel interference, and calls for advanced multi-cell interference coordination techniques to capitalize cell densification gains. One option to address this problem is to use multiple antennas at the Base Stations (BSs), and implement Transmit Beamforming (TBF) to coordinate the interference generated to neighboring cells. A small cell BS should be low-cost by definition, and should be designed to serve typically a small number of Mobile Stations (MSs). Accordingly, we consider that each BS uses the same TBF vector to communicate with its associated MSs in the whole frequency band, and that the optimal TBF vector is determined utilizing a cooperative decentralized scheme. The proposed scheme seeks the maximization of a global utility function of the whole Small Cell Network (SCN), and relies solely on the exchange of low-rate signaling information among neighboring cells. As expected, the gain of the proposed cooperative TBF scheme increases as the number of MSs per cell decreases. A similar behavior is observed when the number of cooperative BSs per cell cluster grows. Thus, the proposed scheme seems to be applicable to SCNs with notable performance gains.	beamforming;centralized computing;entropy maximization;expectation–maximization algorithm;frequency band;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;mobile device;optimization problem;round-robin scheduling;scheduling (computing);telecommunications link;utility	Alexis Alfredo Dowhuszko;Furqan Ahmed;Olav Tirkkonen	2013	2013 First International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)	10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2013.6623394	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;radio resource management;computer network	Mobile	27.24819631581448	89.76050820794583	107415

We study the achievable performance of such networks through a cross-layer design framework. We formulate the joint problem of routing, link scheduling and power allocation as a mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP) and we use column generation (CG) to decompose and linearize it, and hence, solve it. Our numerical results show that when SIC and power control are combined, around 75% performance improvement in dense networks may be achieved in comparison with a network that does not incorporate any advanced interference management techniques.	catastrophic interference;column generation;interference (communication);linear programming;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;routing;scheduling (computing);simplified instructional computer;throughput	Mina Yazdanpanah;Samir Sebbah;Chadi M.

d37205264350cf8651fabfe0cb51b688dbd8cb0f	energy-efficient resource scheduling within drx cycles for lte-a networks with carrier aggregation		For the future-generation wireless communications, the carrier aggregation (CA) of third generation partnership project (3GPP) long-term evolution-advanced (LTE-A) is one of the most promising technologies, which can support significant high data rates over wide frequency bandwidths for various real-time services/applications. To reduce the energy consumption, the LTE-A standard defines the discontinuous reception (DRX) mechanism that allows user equipments (UEs) to turn off radio interfaces when no data is expected to be received. However, how to allocate resource optimally within the DRX cycle for UEs with the CA technology is still an open issue. In this paper, we address the resource scheduling with CA within the DRX cycle, with an objective that maximizes the spectrum utilization while minimizes UE wake-up time. We formulate this problem and propose an energy-efficient iterative heuristic. Our scheme consists of two phases; the first phase determines the scheduling order of component carriers (CCs) to improve the resource efficiency, whereas the second phase minimizes UEs’ unnecessary wake-up periods by optimizing their resource intervals from different CCs. Extensive simulation results show that our scheduling achieves better performance than the existing schemes.	compaq lte;discontinuous reception;heuristic;iterative method;real-time clock;scheduling (computing);simulation;uptime	Lokesh Sharma;Jia-Ming Liang;Shih-Lin Wu	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2833887	lte advanced;resource management;throughput;discontinuous reception;computer network;resource efficiency;3rd generation partnership project 2;quality of service;scheduling (computing);computer science	Embedded	25.90341312918019	92.38026166843504	107882
e962ea1b8d3986878800125c98ce0604736f5b8c	estimating the distance between macro base station and users in heterogeneous networks		In underlay heterogeneous networks (HetNets), the distance between a macro base station (MBS) and a macro user (MU) is crucial for a small-cell base station (SBS) to control the interference to the MU and achieve the coexistence. To obtain the distance between the MBS and the MU, the SBS needs a backhaul link from the macro system, such that the macro system is able to transmit the information of the distance to the SBS through the backhaul link. However, there may not exist any backhaul link from the macro system to the SBS in practical situations. Thus, it is challenging for the SBS to obtain the distance. To deal with this issue, we propose a median based (MB) estimator for the SBS to obtain the distance between the MBS and the MU without any backhaul link. Numerical results show that the estimation error of the MB estimator can be as small as 4%.	backhaul (telecommunications);coexist (image);interference (communication);smart battery system	Lin Zhang;Wenli Zhou;Wanbin Tang;Gang Wu;Zhi Chen	2017	2017 14th IEEE Annual Consumer Communications & Networking Conference (CCNC)	10.1109/CCNC.2017.7983257	telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	26.38425536446314	88.7232920852075	107962

The relays use the decode-and-forward protocol while all transmissions use orthogonal frequency division multiplexing. The key to our approach is fractional cooperation: there may be fewer relays than sources and not all source subcarriers are relayed. Optimal matching of the sources subcarriers with those of the relays is a combinatorial problem with exponential complexity. We develop an upper bound on the max-min rate and present an algorithm with a close to optimum performance. Furthermore, our simulation results show that for certain number of sources in a network, accounting for the overhead due to relaying, there is an optimal number of relays maximizing the max-min rate. This number is in general less than the number of sources.	algorithm;frequency divider;maxima and minima;multi-source;multiplexing;multistage interconnection networks;optimal matching;overhead (computing);relay;shortest path problem;simulation;subcarrier;time complexity	Ehsan Karamad;Raviraj S.

For this, the ability for spectrum sensing, spectrum sharing, choosing the best spectrum among the available options, and dynamically adapting transmission parameters based on the activity of the licensed spectrum owners must be integrated within cognitive radio users. Specifically in cognitive radio ad hoc networks, distributed multihop architecture, node mobility, and spatio-temporal variance in spectrum availability are some of the key distinguishing factors. In this article the important features of CRAHNs are presented, along with the design approaches and research challenges that must be addressed. Spectrum management in CRAHNs comprises spectrum sensing, sharing, decision, and mobility. In this article each of these functions are described in detail from the viewpoint of multihop infra-structureless networks requiring cooperation among users.	cognitive radio;communications protocol;end-to-end principle;full-spectrum light;hoc (programming language);ibm systems network architecture;multi-user;network packet;network performance;programming paradigm;propagation constant;protocol stack;scheduling (computing)	Ian F.

In this work, we consider a 5G Superfluid network, as an outcome of the H2020 project SUPERFLUIDITY. The project exploits the concept of Reusable Functional Block (RFB), a virtual resource that can be deployed on top of 5G physical nodes. Specifically, we focus on the management of the RFBs in a Superfluid network to deliver a high definition video to the users. We design an efficient algorithm, called P5G, which is based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Our solution targets different Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), including the maximization of user throughput, or the minimization of the number of used 5G nodes. Results, obtained over a representative scenario, show that P5G is able to wisely manage the RFBs, while always guaranteeing a large throughput to the users.	computation;computational complexity theory;data rate units;electronic product code;expectation–maximization algorithm;logical connective;p5 (microarchitecture);particle swarm optimization;serial digital video out;throughput;time complexity	Mohammad Shojafar;Luca Chiaraviglio;Nicola Blefari-Melazzi;Stefano Salsano	2017	GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254683	performance indicator;throughput;algorithm;minification;computer science;maximization;exploit;particle swarm optimization	HPC	26.195030954768708	93.15021178199197	108545

This paper proposes a resource allocation strategy for the uplink fractional frequency reuse in the variant soft frequency reuse. Soft frequency reuse means that the resources of every sector are separated into a home partition and two side partitions. While resources of the home partition may be allocated to all users, resources of the side partitions are available for cell center users only. The main contribution of this paper is to use the most robust and power-efficient modulation and coding schemes on the side partitions as long as resources are available. A simulation study shows that with non-saturated users the system capacity can be increased when preferring power-efficient modulation and coding schemes on the side partitions.	channel capacity;interference (communication);modulation;simulation;telecommunications link	Florian Wamser;David Mittelstädt;Dirk Staehle;Phuoc Tran-Gia	2010		10.1145/1868521.1868544	wimax;electrical efficiency;telecommunications link;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;computer network	Mobile	27.9221270140029	89.8765526620238	108655

For cognition in WSNs, spectrum sensing is one of the most crucial function to prevent hazardous interferences with the licensed users and to identify available spectrum for improving the spectrum utilization. In this paper, we propose a robust cooperative spectrum sensing method based on Dempster-Shafer (D-S) theory. Firstly, taking into account the increase of transmitted data with the rise of the number of sensor nodes and the power limitation of nodes, we propose to adapt the D-S theory to the binary hypothesis test at the local sensing sensor node, in order to reduce the amount of control data to be transmitted. Secondly, we consider that some cognitive nodes may not work as expected. Hence, facing this problem of faulty nodes in CWSNs, we propose an evaluation method which considers simultaneously the sensor node reliability and the mutually supportive degree among different sensor nodes to support adapted decision. Simulation results show that the proposed method allows to improve significantly the detection performance compared to other techniques, even in presence of faulty nodes.	algorithm;cognition;download;sensor node;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;testbed;tip (unix utility);transmitter;phpmyadmin	Shaoyang Men;Pascal Chargé;Sébastien Pillement	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)	10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247201	wireless sensor network;sensor node;reliability theory;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;mathematical model;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;signal-to-noise ratio;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;robustness	Mobile	47.736446349012446	88.81016495154289	108775

In this paper we investigate the potential of using power back-off (PBO) as a means to achieve higher energy efficiency. Based on a global energy optimisation formulation we derive an energy efficient PBO (EEPBO) algorithm. Through simulation we compare EEPBO with continuous bit-loading to the near-optimal energy efficient spectrum balancing (EESB) algorithm and an integer bit-loading version of EEPBO with energy efficient iterative spectrum balancing (EEISB). By restricting the search to practical levels of PBO parameters instead of optimizing the bit-loading on each and every carrier separately we see a significant reduction in computational complexity. It also means that EEPBO is already supported by current VDSL2 systems. Still, even after restricting the spectrum to what the PBO in VDSL2 allows we can show, through simulations, that EEPBO achieves the same level of energy efficiency as the near-optimal methods. This high performance and low-complexity together with standard compliance makes EEPBO a very attractive choice for future energy efficient transmission in VDSL2.	algorithm;computational complexity theory;iterative method;mathematical optimization;modem;plate boundary observatory;simulation;standards-compliant	Tomas Nordström;Driton Statovci;Martin Wolkerstorfer	2009	2009 17th European Signal Processing Conference		mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science	EDA	32.297700476243875	91.99197621973882	108776

The users' data signals are transmitted cooperatively via the base stations (BSs) of a cluster within the sectorized multicell heterogeneous cellular network. Exhaustive search as the optimal scheduling method is extremely complex, particularly for large numbers of users requesting service. We therefore propose suboptimal scheduling algorithms based on the lower complexity metaheuristic stochastic optimization techniques of simulated annealing (SA) and particle swarm (PS). Moreover, a hybrid algorithm combining the traits of PS and a greedy scheduler is also proposed. The performance and complexity of these algorithms are evaluated for a heterogeneous system model employing different precoding methods. Assessing the algorithms' performance via computer simulations, the effectiveness of the proposed schemes in terms of sum rate is demonstrated, yielding performance very close to that of the exhaustive search at much lower complexity. For each precoding method used in the employed system model, the best corresponding approach to scheduling from our proposed algorithms is determined.	backhaul (telecommunications);blu-ray;brute-force search;channel state information;computer simulation;deferred procedure call;expectation–maximization algorithm;fairness measure;greedy algorithm;heterogeneous computing;hybrid algorithm;mimo;mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;modulo operation;multi-user;proportionally fair;scheduling (computing);simulated annealing;stochastic optimization;swarm;telecommunications link;utility;web server	Hakimeh Purmehdi;Robert C.

32935ccdc50383d42929a3beefe93b2f3b1ffc75	joint mode selection and resource allocation in underlaying d2d communication		Device-to-device (D2D) communication as an underlay to cellular networks is a promising technology to improve network capacity and user experience. However, it depends on elegant resource management between cellular users and D2D pairs. In this work, we study the problem of D2D communication underlaying cellular networks sharing uplink resources, which focuses on maximizing the sum rate of D2D pairs while guaranteeing the quality of existing cellular users. A three-step scheme is proposed. We first conduct mode selection to decide whether a D2D pair can share links with a cellular user. And then, we match a cellular user with each D2D pair based on the principle of fairness and try to maximize the sum rate of D2D pairs. Finally, a joint power control strategy is developed and a closed-form of solution is provided. The superiority of the proposed scheme is demonstrated in the numerical results.

In this paper, we extend our framework for integrated self-organizing networks by the energy saving management self-organizing network use case. In contrast to coordination among multiple use cases, this approach targets at an integrated solution, where the coordination is inherent in the optimization enabling managing multiple use cases concurrently. Moreover, it considers dynamic traffic and interference situations, and predicts cell loads for various network configurations based on measurements of receiving and traffic conditions. Using the cell load as a proxy for evaluating network performance and base station energy consumption, we show that a joint optimization of cell individual offsets and antenna downtilts is superior to the adjustment of cell individual offsets only. Throughout a day, we observe remarkable improvements in user throughputs and reduction in network energy consumption further enhanced by switching off base stations.	cell (microprocessor);interference (communication);mathematical optimization;network performance;next-generation network;organizing (structure);self-organization;self-organizing map	Henrik Klessig;Albrecht J.

The approach employs discrete mathematical programming, which is potentially complex, and analytical solutions are not available. In this paper, sub-optimal approaches are examined. In particular, analytical expressions are derived for optimal resource allocation involving a single MS. Based on the single-MS solution, a sub-optimal, sequential optimization procedure for multiple MS's is presented. Numerical results show that when the order for allocating resources to MS's is judiciously chosen based on the MS channel conditions and/or traffic loads, the sequential solution is an attractive alternative to the more complex joint optimization. This is especially true when radio resources are scarce.	computational complexity theory;discrete optimization;floor and ceiling functions;load balancing (computing);mathematical optimization;modulation;multi categories security;nonlinear programming;numerical method;optimization problem;overlap–add method;scheduling (computing);telecommunications link;xfig	Raymond Kwan;Cyril Leung	2007	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2007.06030059	code division multiple access;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;computer network	Mobile	32.79993588257672	89.66523308598383	109327

We provide the optimality conditions that need to be satisfied by the powers associated with the users' codewords and derive the closed form expressions for the optimal powers. We propose two algorithms that can be used to optimize the powers to achieve any desired rate pair on the rate region boundary: a projected subgradient algorithm, and an iterative waterfilling-like algorithm based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions for optimality, which operates one user at a time and converges much faster. We observe that, utilization of power control to take advantage of the diversity offered by the cooperative OFDMA system, not only leads to a remarkable improvement in achievable rates, but also may help determine how the subchannels have to be instantaneously allocated to various tasks in cooperation. Simulations show that the gain from power allocation is still significant even when the CSI feedback is limited.	algorithm;channel state information;code word;digital subchannel;duality (optimization);ecmascript;frequency divider;iteration;iterative method;karush–kuhn–tucker conditions;lagrange multiplier;lagrangian (field theory);markov chain;multi-user;rate of convergence;rewriting;scenario (computing);simulation;social inequality;subderivative;subgradient method;tucker decomposition;vii	Sezi Bakim;Onur Kaya	2013	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2012.120412.120030	mathematical optimization;real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;power control;resource allocation;computer science;mathematics;markov process;encoding	Mobile	35.62917656559286	88.69558467567396	109492
c35d75edc34a175e45e002b716590a944cb9461f	joint allocation of uplink and downlink resources for interactive mobile cloud applications		Cloud-based mobile applications are interactive in nature. Due to the strong correlation between uplink request and downlink response, it is irrational to optimize the uplink and downlink resource allocation problem separately and independently. In this paper, the joint uplink and downlink resource allocation problem for interactive mobile cloud applications is considered. The data exchange characteristics between mobile terminal and cloud server is investigated and a novel traffic model including both uplink and downlink transmission queues is constructed. Based on the new traffic model, the resource allocation problem can be formulated as a constrained Markov Decision Process. The objective is to minimize the application response time, that is, the roundtrip delay of causally related packet group PG pairs, with a constraint on PG drop rate. The Q-learning algorithm and Value Iteration Algorithm are employed to obtain a solution that converges to the optimal one. To combat the curse of dimensionality, a sub-optimal solution is proposed to solve the problem with an acceptable complexity. Numerical results indicate that the reduced complexity solution can achieve a delay performance approximate to that of the optimal solution and outperform other allocation schemes.

eb35676c6a0e5d614f50c44d5f14234427c9dde5	device-to-device communications in multi-cell lte-advanced networks with cloud radio access network architecture		Device-to-device communications underlaying LTE-Advanced wireless networks reuse cellular spectrum to establish direct links between users without traversing the base stations or the cellular network. In this paradigm, there is a need to allocate the resources with a view to maximizing the utility (e.g., the total throughput) and mitigating the interference caused by sharing the same spectrum between cellular users and D2D pairs. This article, which is tutorial in nature, proposes a scheme for maximizing the total number of active D2D pairs and reused channels while minimizing the aggregate transmit power of cellular users and D2D pairs and maintaining their required QoS to the extent possible. This reduces the load on base stations, lessens power consumption, and improves spectrum efficiency beyond the conventional cellular frequency reuse schemes. Unlike many existing works that assume a single cell, we consider a multi-cell scenario in which the transmitter and the receiver of each D2D pair can be in the same cell or in different cells, and each user can simultaneously transmit over multiple reused channels. The allocation is done via a centralized baseband processing in the cloud radio access network architecture. Simulations show that via our proposed scheme, more users (both cellular users and D2D pairs) can simultaneously communicate, and the total system throughput is also significantly increased.	aggregate data;baseband;centralized computing;cloud computing;compaq lte;interference (communication);network architecture;programming paradigm;quality of service;radio access network;spectral efficiency;throughput;transmitter	Sajjad Mehri Alamouti;Ahmad R.

c7b8131b92ea53ffbbcce81b70a600df682c9a14	efficient graph-based resource allocation scheme using maximal independent set for randomly- deployed small star networks	internet of things;maximal independent set;resource allocation;sensor network;small cell networks	In future scenarios of heterogeneous and dense networks, randomly-deployed small star networks (SSNs) become a key paradigm, whose system performance is restricted to inter-SSN interference and requires an efficient resource allocation scheme for interference coordination. Traditional resource allocation schemes do not specifically focus on this paradigm and are usually too time consuming in dense networks. In this article, a very efficient graph-based scheme is proposed, which applies the maximal independent set (MIS) concept in graph theory to help divide SSNs into almost interference-free groups. We first construct an interference graph for the system based on a derived distance threshold indicating for any pair of SSNs whether there is intolerable inter-SSN interference or not. Then, SSNs are divided into MISs, and the same resource can be repetitively used by all the SSNs in each MIS. Empirical parameters and equations are set in the scheme to guarantee high performance. Finally, extensive scenarios both dense and nondense are randomly generated and simulated to demonstrate the performance of our scheme, indicating that it outperforms the classical max K-cut-based scheme in terms of system capacity, utility and especially time cost. Its achieved system capacity, utility and fairness can be close to the near-optimal strategy obtained by a time-consuming simulated annealing search.	channel capacity;dmz (computing);fairness measure;gucy2c protein, human;graph - visual representation;independent set (graph theory);interference (communication);maximal independent set;maximal set;procedural generation;programming paradigm;randomness;resource allocation;simulated annealing;social security number;subscriber identity module	Jian Zhou;Lusheng Wang;Weidong Wang;Qingfeng Zhou	2017		10.3390/s17112553	wireless sensor network;graph theory;simulated annealing;engineering;small cell;maximal independent set;interference (wave propagation);mathematical optimization;distributed computing;resource allocation;star network	Metrics	29.25681907954297	91.16378114587773	109778

Allowing all cells to transmit on the whole bandwidth unveils large potential gains in terms of spectral efficiency, in comparison with conventional cellular systems. Such a scenario, however, is often deemed unfeasible because of the strong multiple access interference (MAI) that negatively affects system performance. This paper presents a layered architecture that integrates a packet scheduler with an adaptive resource allocator that was explicitly designed to take care of the MAI. Each cell performs its resource management in a distributed way with no central controller. Iterative resource allocation assigns radio channels to the users to minimize interference. Packet scheduling guarantees that all users get a fair share of resources, regardless of their position in the cell. This scheduler-allocator architecture integrates both goals and is able to self-adapt to any traffic and user configuration. An adaptive distributed load control strategy can reduce the cell load so that the iterative procedure always converges to a stable allocation, regardless of the interference. Numerical results show that the proposed architecture guarantees both high spectral efficiency and throughput fairness among flows.	algorithm;care-of address;catastrophic interference;column (database);control theory;fairness measure;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);iterative method;linear programming;load management;max-min fairness;multistage interconnection networks;network packet;network scheduler;optimization problem;polyhedron;proportionally fair;scheduling (computing);simulation;social inequality;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;the matrix;throughput;traffic collision avoidance system;unimodular polynomial matrix	Marco Moretti;Alfredo Todini;Andrea Baiocchi;Giulio Dainelli	2011	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2011.2119501	real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;distributed computing;scheduling;computer network	Networks	32.24789430334785	90.73060156117258	109835

Most previous works assume that there are multiple source-destination pairs and multiple relay nodes in a network where each node only serves as one role: either transmission node or relay node. However, this assumption will not always hold in practice where each node has its own information to transmit. This paper studies the maximal lifetime scheduling problem for cooperative communication with guaranteed throughput service in a network environment where there are multiple source-destination pairs and each node can serve as both two roles: transmission node and """"relay"""" node. We first analyze the power allocation of optimal lifetime for a single source-destination pair with a bounded throughput in different communication modes, and then design an optimal polynomial-time algorithm to maximize the network lifetime. This algorithm is based on iteration and tries to find a better solution than that before in each iteration. After that, the optimality of this algorithm has been proved formally. The simulation results show that the algorithm can prolong about 199% lifetime than that of direct transmission."""	algorithm;cooperative mimo;iteration;maxima and minima;maximal set;polynomial;relay;scheduling (computing);throughput;time complexity;xfig	Gang Liu;Liusheng Huang;Hongli Xu;Wang Liu;Yindong Zhang	2010	2010 Proceedings of 19th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks	10.1109/ICCCN.2010.5560158	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;operating system;wireless network;iterative method;computer network	Robotics	33.93040974907314	91.2217182184468	110708

The energy harvesting maximization (EHM) problem is challenging to directly solve, we resort to Bernstein-type inequality restriction technique to reformulate the original problem as a tractable approximated version.

On one hand, the primary link attempts to maximize its quality of service in terms of Signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), accounting for the possible contribution from cooperation. On the other hand, nodes in the secondary network compete among themselves for transmission within the leased time-slot following a distributed heterogeneous opportunistic power control mechanism. The cooperation and competition between the primary and secondary network are cast in the framework of sequential game.

7f1df48115d2eb2a2732d8ef592ef829988391a5	downlink packet scheduling algorithm using tabu method in lte systems		This paper addressed the problem of packet scheduling (PS) on the 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) downlink (DL). The main contribution of this work was to propose a new scheduling and resource allocation scheme that deals with QoS requirements. The objectives of this proposed scheduler are to maximize the system’s sum throughput, to allow a fair distribution of available RBs and to handle GBR and NGBR traffic in LTE downlink systems. The performance of the proposed approach was compared with previous resources allocation and scheduling algorithms such as Best-CQI, RR, and QoE downlink schedulers. Simulation results show that it is possible to achieve a considerable gain in both system’s throughput and fairness.	algorithm;compaq lte;scheduling (computing);tabu search;telecommunications link	Radhia Khdhir;Kais Mnif;Lotfi Kamoun	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-22572-2_1	fair-share scheduling;computer network	Embedded	27.607164919842994	92.914140226497	111560

While most of the previously proposed MAC protocols for CR networks are heuristic and are based on the simplistic protocol model, we design a distributed MAC protocol using the more accurate signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) model. First, we assume that the secondary users are cooperative and formulate the problem of assigning transmission and listening probabilities for random access as a non-convex network utility maximization problem. We propose a three-phase algorithm that converges to a near-optimal solution after solving a number of convex optimization problems distributively. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm based on the SINR model achieves a higher aggregate throughput than other schemes which are based on the protocol model. Then, we consider the case that the secondary users are rational. We use coalitional game theory to study the incentive issues of user cooperation in a given channel for the SINR model. In particular, we use the solution concept of the core to analyze the stability of the grand coalition, and the solution concept of the Shapley value to fairly divide the payoff among the users. We show that the Shapley value lies in the core when all the users are one-hop neighbours of each other. We illustrate the Shapley value and the core with a numerical example.	access control;aggregate data;cognitive radio;convex optimization;distributed algorithm;entropy maximization;game theory;heuristic;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;network utility;numerical analysis;optimization problem;random access;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;stable marriage problem;throughput	Man Hon Cheung;Vincent W.

Their performance is evaluated in a non-linear environment that models the satellite channel behaviour. The stochastic approach consists in the exploration and validation of new load configurations for the downlink channel. Since the carriers have different powers, the complexity of the problem is high. An analytical approach is used for calculating the number and the power of 3 order inter-modulation products, which may also be used for higher order contributions. After this, comparisons between classic and stochastic techniques, in terms of computational time and allocation quality, are shown.	communications satellite;computation;delta-sigma modulation;nonlinear system;telecommunications link;time complexity	Giuseppe Baruffa;Saverio Cacopardi;Fabrizio Frescura;Gianluca Reali	2001	European Transactions on Telecommunications	10.1002/ett.4460120108	genetic algorithm;higher-order logic;frequency allocation;simulated annealing;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science	HPC	44.76209530181565	89.58626362768992	112176

This spectrum is used to establish a secondary network that serves real time connections. The size of leased spectrum influences both the admitted traffic of SUs and the cost of spectrum. For this spectrummarket, we present unsupervised learning paradigm as a means for extracting the optimal control policy for spectrum trading. This policy gives spectrum owner the opportunity to maximize its profit by adapting network resources to the changes in the network status and the market conditions. To meet different requirements, the problem is formulated as reward maximization with penalty for delay. The numerical results show that the proposedmachine learningmethod is able to find an efficient trade-off between profit loss, and average delay for SUs.	cognitive radio;elegant degradation;embedded system;entropy maximization;expectation–maximization algorithm;ibm systems network architecture;numerical analysis;optimal control;optimizing compiler;programming paradigm;quality of service;rl (complexity);requirement;unsupervised learning;wireless mesh network	Ayoub Alsarhan;Ahmad Quttoum;Yousef Kilani	2017	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-017-4274-4	lease;wireless network;cognitive radio;computer network;computer science;real-time computing;unsupervised learning;markov decision process;wireless mesh network;maximization;optimal control	Mobile	26.10041912048582	96.28337915977252	112275

In this scenario, the BS is equipped with multiple antennas, and each user is wiretapped by a specific eavesdropper where each user or eavesdropper is equipped with one antenna. It is supposed that the BS employs transmit beamforming with a given requirement on sum transmitting power. The object is to maximize the sum secrecy rate (SSR) of the network, which leads to a nonconvex complicated structure, and makes he considered beamforming design problem difficult to handle. To solve this problem, a beamforming design scheme is proposed to transform the original problem into a convex approximation problem, by employing semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and first-order approximation technique based on Taylor expansion. Besides, with the advantage of low complexity, a zero-forcing (ZF) based beamforming method is presented in the case that BS is able to nullify he eavesdroppers' rate. Numerical results show that the former strategy achieves better performance than the later one, which is mainly due to the ability of optimizing beamforming direction, and both outperform the traditional signal-to-leakage-and-noise ratio (SLNR) based algorithm.	algorithm;beamforming;channel state information;etsi satellite digital radio;first-order predicate;fractal dimension;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;multi-user;open research;order of approximation;relaxation (approximation);spectral leakage;system analysis;telecommunications link;transmitter;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding	Pu Zhao;Meng Zhang;Huiye Qiu;Hanwen Luo;Wen Chen	2014	2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992154	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;telecommunications;mathematics	Mobile	37.57552622732674	90.05543964908495	112635
3294ba9aea2c1ea11c9e6b2d70f289b1596da682	throughput and energy efficiency maximization for cognitive relay system	throughput;energy efficiency;stability;cognitive radio	Cognitive radio technology, which allows secondary user (SU) to utilize the spectrum holes left by primary user (PU), was proposed to solve spectrum under-utilization problem. However, due to sensing error, SUu0027s transmission will bring negative effects to PUu0027s communication. Recently, cooperative relay technology was introduced to solve this problem. In this paper, a cooperative framework, which allows SU to act as a relay for primary link when needed, is considered and then a cognitive relay scheme is proposed. In order to maximize SUu0027s throughput while keeping the system stable, we study and obtain SUu0027s optimal strategy (i.e., relaying strategy and power allocation) by a constrained optimization problem. Since energy consumption is also an important problem for cognitive radio networks, we also investigate SUu0027s optimal strategy to maximize SUu0027s energy efficiency while keeping the system stable. The numerical results show that the cognitive relay scheme can achieve higher throughput and energy efficiency than reference schemes.	expectation–maximization algorithm;relay;throughput	You Xu;Yunzhou Li;Ming Zhao;Hongxing Zou	2012	IEICE Transactions		throughput;cognitive radio;simulation;stability;telecommunications;computer science;efficient energy use;computer network	SE	32.263495976644776	93.8206831620452	112719
0478dfe2fd6b694127c72066c544381ea22d481f	robust secure beamforming for wireless powered full-duplex systems with self-energy recycling		In this paper, we study a multiuser wireless powered communication system, where an energy-constrained full-duplex information transmitter (IT), powered by wireless energy from a dedicated energy transmitter (ET), intends to send confidential information to the information receiver (IR) in the presence of multiple idle users that could be the potential eavesdroppers. In the practical scenario of imperfect channel state information and assuming that the idle users need to harvest energy from the ET, we aim to maximize the worst-case secrecy rate at the IR by jointly optimizing the transmit covariance matrix at the ET as well as the information beamforming and artificial noise covariance at the IT, subject to their individual transmit power constraints and the minimum required power transferred to the idle users. We employ the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and extended S-procedure approaches to transform the original nonconvex optimization problem into convex problem, which can be efficiently solved by solving a sequence of semidefinite programs. Furthermore, we show that the SDR is tight since there always exists a rank-one optimal solution. For performance comparison, two heuristic schemes for ease of implementation are also developed. Numerical results are presented to show the effectiveness of our proposed schemes.	beamforming;best, worst and average case;channel state information;confidentiality;convex optimization;duplex (telecommunications);etsi satellite digital radio;heuristic;lagrangian relaxation;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;multi-user;numerical method;optimization problem;s-procedure;semidefinite programming;transmitter	Wei Wu;Wang Baoyun;Yong Zeng;Haiyang Zhang;Zhenxing Yang;Zhixiang Deng	2017	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2017.2744982	electronic engineering;duplex (telecommunications);channel state information;communications system;transmitter power output;real-time computing;covariance;beamforming;computer science;idle;optimization problem	Mobile	37.431251040045886	89.98629901743294	112724

Different from homogeneous network settings, the inevitable requirement of robustly protecting the quality-of-service (QoS) of all prioritized macrocell user equipments (MUEs) here lays a major obstacle that hinders the successful application of any available solutions. Directly targeting at this central issue, the first algorithm jointly maximizes the total utility of both user classes. Specifically, we adopt the log-barrier penalty method to effectively enforce the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) imposed by the macrocell, paving the way for the adaptation of load-spillage solution framework. On the other hand, the second algorithm is applied to the scenario where only the sum utility of all FUEs needs to be maximized. At optimality, we show that the MUEs' prescribed SINR constraints are met with equality in this case. With the search space for Pareto-optimal SINRs substantially reduced, the second algorithm features scalability, low computational complexity, short converging time, and stable performance. We prove that the two developed algorithms converge to their respective global optima, and more importantly, they can be implemented in a distributive manner at individual links. Effective mechanisms are also available to flexibly designate the access priority to MUEs and FUEs, as well as to fairly share radio resources among users.

8d9a0d65207c195d16fefc5b4fb44e8579ee1e42	downlink resource allocation in ofdma wireless networks under power amplifier non-linearity		In this study, the physical layer resource allocation in orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) systems is studied by considering the non-linear effects of power amplifier (PA). The non-linearity produces cross-correlation among the subcarriers and results in deteriorating the OFDMA subcarriers orthogonality. Hence, the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) of the output signal of PA for OFDMA signal with different power scaling factors for subcarriers is derived. Then, the theoretical SIR is verified by simulation result. Next, the optimisation problem is designed to maximise the total achievable downlink rate of all users by assigning subcarriers and power scaling factors. This non-convex problem is solved by comprehensive learning particle swarm optimisation. The simulation results show that when PA is non-linear, better total rate is achieved by considering non-linearity in resource allocation compared with the conventional resource allocation techniques.	audio power amplifier;convex optimization;cross-correlation;image scaling;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;particle swarm optimization;simulation;subcarrier;telecommunications link	Mina Baghani;Abbas Mohammadi;Mahdi Majidi	2017	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2016.0811	computer network;wireless network;mathematics;signal-to-interference ratio;physical layer;telecommunications link;amplifier;resource allocation;particle swarm optimization;orthogonality	Mobile	33.09069403790472	91.66653492223585	113029

Based on the DP solutions which are impractical, two new algorithms suitable for next generation wireless networks are proposed. The first one is an integrated hard handoff/power control scheme that endeavors a tradeoff between three performance criteria: transmitted power, number of handoffs, and call quality. The second is a soft handoff/power control algorithm that also takes into account the additional cost of utilizing soft handoff. The proposed algorithms present a paradigm shift in integrated handoff/power control by capturing the tradeoff between user satisfaction and network overhead, therefore enjoy the advantages of joint resource allocation, and provide significant improvement over existing methods. The achievable gains and the tradeoffs in both algorithms are verified through simulations.	algorithm;computation;delay slot;dynamic programming;elegant degradation;gradient descent;iterative method;local optimum;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;next-generation network;open research;overhead (computing);programming paradigm;sampling (signal processing);simulation;telecommunications link	Mehmet Akar	2009	Wireless Networks	10.1007/s11276-007-0069-y	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;handover;computer network	Mobile	31.665551940176613	91.44914793621352	113745

The basic scenario is that a cluster of source nodes cooperatively forms multiple data-carrying beams toward multiple destination nodes. To resolve the hidden node problem, we impose a link constraint on the receive power at each unintended destination node. Then the problem becomes to optimize the transmit powers and beam weights at the source cluster subject to the maximal transmit power constraint, the minimal receive signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at the destination nodes, and the minimal receive power constraints at the unintended destination nodes. We first propose an iterative transmit power allocation algorithm under fixed beamformers subject to the maximal transmit power constraint, as well as the minimal receive SINR and receive power constraints. We then develop a joint optimization algorithm to iteratively optimize the powers and the beamformers based on the duality analysis. Since channel state information (CSI) is required by the sources to perform the above optimization, we further propose a cooperative scheme to implement a simple CSI estimation and feedback mechanism based on the subspace tracking principle. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms.	algorithm;beamforming;channel state information;feedback;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);iterative method;mathematical optimization;maximal set;performance;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation	Chuxiang Li;Xiaodong Wang	2008	EURASIP J.

3d2b3ae3bdadcfd5f7950fab01e78df26df977db	joint antenna selection and transceiver design for mu-mimo mmwave systems		This paper considers the uplink of large-scale multiple-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) millimeter wave (mmWave) systems, where a number of mobile stations (MSs) communicate with a single base station (BS) equipped with a large-scale antenna array, for application to fifth generation (5G) wireless networks. Within this context, the use of hybrid transceivers along with antenna selection can significantly reduce the implementation cost and energy consumption of analog phase shifters and low-noise amplifiers (LNA). We aim to jointly design the MS beamforming vectors, the hybrid receiving matrices (baseband and analog) and the antenna selection matrix at the BS in order to maximize the achievable system sum-rate. By exploiting the special structure of the problem and linear relaxation, we first convert this problem into three subproblems which are solved via an alternating optimization (AO) method. Specifically, the antenna selection matrix is optimized via the concave-convex procedure (CCCP); the weighted mean-square error minimization (WMMSE) approach is used to find the solution for the transmit beamformer; and the hybrid receiver is obtained via manifold optimization (MO). The convergence of the proposed algorithm is analysed and its effectiveness is verified by simulation.	algorithm;ambient occlusion;baseband;beamforming;computational complexity theory;concave function;fifth generation computer;linear programming relaxation;low-noise amplifier;mimo-ofdm;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;multi-user mimo;numerical analysis;selection algorithm;simulation;telecommunications link;transceiver	Xiongfei Zhai;Yunlong Cai;Qingjiang Shi;Minjian Zhao;Geoffrey Ye Li;Benoît Champagne	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2017.7996971	real-time computing;mimo;electronic engineering;transceiver;multi-user mimo;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;antenna array;beamforming;base station;baseband	Mobile	38.232690059867515	90.23053989783844	114072

In this paper, we develop a proper inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC) scheme for downlink co-channel interference through cognitive sensing performed by subnet nodes in heterogeneous network (Het-Net). The more co-channel interference is avoided by cognitive interference model, the more power is saved for the macro BS and subnet nodes. The strategy framework of the cognitive critical ratio and power reward factor is set up for interference management aiming to get the maximum net saving power for the macro BS and subnet nodes. We use multiple objective non-linear programming (MONLP) and genetic algorithm (GA) to obtain the global optimum solution. Finally, the practical implementation in Het-Net for long term evolution advanced (LTE-A) is designed. The numerical evaluation and system simulation results demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed ICIC scheme.	compaq lte;genetic algorithm;global optimization;hall-effect thruster;interference (communication);linear programming;low-power broadcasting;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;relay;simulation;software release life cycle;subnetwork;telecommunications link	Bo Li	2011	2011 IEEE 73rd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VETECS.2011.5956782	electronic engineering;genetic algorithm;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;nonlinear programming;computer science;engineering;computer network	Mobile	29.533099439120672	91.94825814781976	114618

We consider a scenario where users served by a base station face interference from a neighboring base station. We model the interference from the neighboring base station as an ON/OFF renewal process, that arises due to its idle and busy cycles. The users feedback their downlink signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) values to their base station, but these values are outdated. In this setting, we characterize how the resource allocation layer can optimally exploit the reported SINR values, which could be unreliable due to time-varying interference. In particular, we propose resource allocation policies in two well-known paradigms. First, we address the problem of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$\alpha $ </tex-math></inline-formula>–fair scheduling, and propose a policy that ensures asymptotic convergence to the optimal <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$\alpha $ </tex-math></inline-formula>–fair throughput. Second, we propose a throughput optimal resource allocation policy, i.e., a policy that can stably support the largest possible set of traffic rates under the interference scenario considered. Estimating the outage probability from the outdated SINR values plays an important role in both scheduling paradigms, and we accomplish this using tool from renewal theory."""	advanced transportation controller;algorithm;cobham's thesis;downtime;fairness measure;gradient;instruction unit;interference (communication);lyapunov fractal;scheduling (computing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;stochastic approximation;telecommunications link;throughput	Ravi Kiran Raman;Krishna P.

No-reference logarithmic model is introduced to quantify service experience for each user and the objective is to maximize sum of all user’s mean of score (MOS). We firstly formulate the optimal problem into an S-dimensional (S-D) assignment problem. Then, to solve this problem, the modified Lagrangian relaxation algorithm is deduced to obtain the suboptimal result of joint user-paring and subchannel allocation. The merits of this solution are as follows. First, the gap between its results and the global optimal one can be quantified and controlled by balancing the complexity and accuracy, which merit the other suboptimal algorithms do not have. Secondly, it has the polynomial computational complexity and the worst case complexity is O(3LN³), where L is the maximum iteration time and N is the number of subchannels. Simulations also prove that our proposed algorithm can effectively improve quality of experience and the gap between our proposed and the optimal algorithms can be controlled below 8%.	mimo	Yahui Hu;Song Ci	2015	TIIS	10.3837/tiis.2015.10.004	mathematical optimization;simulation;computer science;theoretical computer science	HPC	33.40026343695905	91.69834637792823	115122

This paper investigates the sum rate maximization problem for NOMA system over a frequency selective fading channel with its users being paired according to their channel powers. A hierarchical power allocation process is proposed, whereby the users are divided into two groups such that a closed form power allocation solution can be applied. This divide-and allocate approach is repeated until all users are allocated with a transmission power. The proposed architecture facilitates a large number of users for NOMA system.

Due to their dense deployment, some SCs will not be connected directly to the core network, and thus, they may forward their traffic to the neighboring SCs until they reach it, thereby forming a multihop backhaul (BH) network. This is a promising solution, since the expected short length of BH links enables the use of millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies to provide high-capacity BH. In this context, user association becomes challenging due to the multihop BH architecture, and therefore, new optimal solutions should be developed. Thus, in this paper, we study the user association problem aiming at the joint maximization of network energy efficiency (EE) and spectrum efficiency (SE), without compromising the user quality of service (QoS). The problem is formulated as an  $\varepsilon$-constraint problem, which considers the transmit energy consumption both in the access network, i.e., the links between the users and their serving cells, and the BH links. The optimal Pareto-front solutions of the problem are analytically derived for different BH technologies, and insights are gained into the EE and SE tradeoff. The proposed optimal solutions, despite their high complexity, can be used as a benchmark for the performance evaluation of user association algorithms. We also propose a heuristic algorithm, which is compared with reference solutions under different traffic scenarios and BH technologies. Our results motivate the use of mmWave BH, whereas the proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal performance.	access network;adaptive algorithm;backhaul (telecommunications);benchmark (computing);entropy maximization;expectation–maximization algorithm;heuristic (computer science);pareto efficiency;performance evaluation;quality of service;software deployment;spectral efficiency;unreal development kit;x86	Agapi Mesodiakaki;Ferran Adelantado;Luis Alonso;Marco Di Renzo;Christos V.

The use of a large number of IoT devices makes the spectrum scarcity problem even more serious. The usable spectrum resources are almost entirely occupied, and thus, the increasing radio access demands of IoT devices cannot be met. To tackle this problem, the Cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) has been proposed. In a CIoT network, secondary users, i.e., sensors and actuators, can access the licensed spectrum bands provided by licensed primary users (such as telephones). Security is a major concern in CIoT networks. However, the traditional encryption method at upper layers (such as symmetric cryptography and asymmetric cryptography) may be compromised in CIoT networks, since these types of networks are heterogeneous. In this paper, we address the security issue in spectrum-leasing-based CIoT networks using physical layer methods. Considering that the CIoT networks are cooperative networks, we propose to employ cooperative jamming to achieve secrecy transmission. In the cooperative jamming scheme, a certain secondary user is employed as the helper to harvest energy transmitted by the source and then uses the harvested energy to generate an artificial noise that jams the eavesdropper without interfering with the legitimate receivers. The goal is to minimize the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) at the eavesdropper subject to the quality of service (QoS) constraints of the primary traffic and the secondary traffic. We formulate the considered minimization problem into a two-stage robust optimization problem based on the worst-case Channel State Information of the Eavesdropper. By using semi-definite programming (SDP), the optimal solutions of the transmit covariance matrices can be obtained. Moreover, in order to build an incentive mechanism for the secondary users, we propose an auction framework based on the cooperative jamming scheme. The proposed auction framework jointly formulates the helper selection and the corresponding energy allocation problems under the constraint of the eavesdropper's SINR. By adopting the Vickrey auction, truthfulness and individual rationality can be guaranteed. Simulation results demonstrate the good performance of the cooperative jamming scheme and the auction framework.	as-interface;addresses (publication format);allocation;anatomic node;bands;best, worst and average case;channel state information;computer security;confidentiality;cooperative multitasking;encryption;genetic heterogeneity;interference (communication);internet of things;jam;mathematical optimization;node - plant part;optimal stopping;optimization problem;personnameuse - assigned;programming languages;public-key cryptography;quality of service;radio jamming;rationality;relay device component;robust optimization;robustness (computer science);semantic network;semiconductor industry;semidefinite programming;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;symmetric-key algorithm;telephone;time complexity;transmitter device component;anatomical layer;disease transmission;sensor (device)	Zhen Li;Tao Jing;Liran Ma;Yan Huo;Jin Qian	2016		10.3390/s16030339	vickrey auction;telecommunications;engineering;computer security;computer network	Mobile	34.06926337394646	95.08475223246968	115165

We first formulate the problem as an Integer Linear Program (ILP) whose objective is to minimize the number of allocated RBs of a closed femtocell, while guaranteeing minimum throughput for each user. In view of the NP-hardness of the ILP, we then propose an intelligent optimization algorithm called ACO- HM algorithm with reduced polynomial time complexity. In the ACO-HM algorithm, the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm is to allocate appropriate RBs to mobile users, while the Harmonic Mean (HM) method is to select a better MCS than the MINimum/MAXimum MCS selection schemes (MINIMAX). Simulation results show that compared with the ACO-MIN algorithm and the ACO-MAX algorithm, the proposed ACO- HM algorithm achieves better performance with fewer RBs and provides Quality-of-Service (QoS) guarantees.	algorithm;ant colony optimization algorithms;compaq lte;linear programming;mathematical optimization;max;minimax;modulation;multi categories security;multitier architecture;np-hardness;quality of service;simulation;telecommunications link;throughput;time complexity	Longfei Li;Xin Chen;Xudong Xiang	2014	The 2014 5th International Conference on Game Theory for Networks	10.1109/GAMENETS.2014.7043723	mathematical optimization;real-time computing;computer science;theoretical computer science	Robotics	28.03992294156683	92.98698746557147	115312

In this paper, we consider the joint design of beam selection and precoding to maximize the sum rate of a downlink single-sided lens MU-MIMO mmWave system under transmit power constraints. We first formulate the optimization problem into a tractable form using the popular weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) approach. To solve this problem, we then propose an efficient joint beam selection and precoding algorithm based on the innovative penalty dual decomposition (PDD) method. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can achieve near-optimal performance when compared to the fully digital precoding scheme and thus outperform the competing methods.1	algorithm;cobham's thesis;entropy maximization;expectation–maximization algorithm;lagrangian relaxation;mimo;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;multi-user mimo;optimization problem;radio frequency;simulation;telecommunications link	Rongbin Guo;Yunlong Cai;Qingjiang Shi;Minjian Zhao;Benoît Champagne	2017	2017 IEEE 28th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2017.8292406	mimo;transmitter power output;real-time computing;multi-user mimo;wireless;telecommunications link;antenna array;precoding;minimum mean square error;computer science;electronic engineering	Embedded	38.3883409997912	90.29942545602091	115406

In the considered system, two selfish user nodes can act as a source as well as a potential relay for each other. A transmission node with energy limitation is willing to seek cooperative relaying only if the data-rate achieved through cooperation is not lower than that achieved without cooperation by consuming the same amount of energy. The cooperative strategy of a node can be defined as the number of data-symbols and power that it is willing to contribute for relaying purpose. We formulate this two-node fair and efficient resource sharing problem as a bargaining game. Since the Nash bargaining solution (NBS) to the game is computationally complex to obtain, a low-complexity algorithm to search the suboptimal NBS is proposed. Simulation results show that the NBS results are fair in that both nodes could experience better performance than if they work independently. And the NBS results are efficient in that the performance loss of the game to that of the maximal overall rate scheme is small while the maximal-rate scheme is unfair.	algorithm;game theory;mathematical optimization;maximal set;multi-user mimo;nash equilibrium;netbeans ide;relay;scheme;simulation;telecommunications network	Guopeng Zhang;Li Cong;Enjie Ding;Kun Yang;Xiaodong Yang	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/icc.2011.5962621	simulation;computer science;resource management;distributed computing;time division multiple access;computer network	Robotics	32.31007032946911	93.93343966711537	115642

The framework for this analysis assumes users and base stations (BSs) to be independently marked point processes in R2. The relationship between spatially averaged rate, user density, and base station density, which is an extension of findings in [1], is used in an affine power model to estimate the energy that can be saved by the two methods under consideration. The primary contribution of this paper constitutes an analytic relationship between spatially averaged rate, user density, BS density, transmit power, and the noise power. Another key contribution is a proof that shows that power saved by using sleep modes (or turning off BSs) is always greater than the power saved by varying the BW, for a system model implementing an affine power model (described here) when traffic densities below full load are considered.	approximation;assertion (software development);bandwidth (signal processing);kernel density estimation;mathematical model;noise power;sleep mode	Vinay Suryaprakash;Albrecht J.

However, the time allocation is still an important issue that limits the performance of this system seriously. Unlike the centralized distribution methods under complete information in previous studies, in this paper, we introduce a financing contract mechanism to solve the time allocation problem with strongly incomplete information, where the primary user (PU) only knows the probability distribution of each secondary transmitter’s (ST’s) type. In this contract, the PU and SUs act as the seller and buyers, respectively. The mutually beneficial relationships between the PU and SUs can be linked with the signed contract about the amount of the signal transmitting time and the payment. Then, we discuss three cases where either or both adverse selection and moral hazard are present due to the information asymmetry. Moreover, the optimal contracts under three scenarios are further formulated and solved by using the Lagrangian multiplier method. Finally, simulation results show that compared with the case of complete information the contract with adverse selection and moral hazard has a small performance loss, which is acceptable on account of the practical superiority of the strongly incomplete information case.

In this paper, we introduce coordinated multi-point (CoMP) and carrier aggregation (CA) techniques in HetNets to guarantee the availability of all user equipment (UE), where the CoMP improves the single-path availability, and the CA enhances availability via multi-carrier gain combining. To characterize the availability, we first derive an exact closed-form expression for the availability of a random UE in a CoMP and CA-enabled HetNets. To achieve the maximum UE availability, we formulate a max-min optimization problem. To solve it, we then propose a two-step optimization algorithm (TSOA) and a joint (JTOA). The TSOA is based on heuristic algorithm for the optimal subcarrier assignment and UE association, and based on the Lagrangian dual method for the power allocation. The JTOA is based on genetic algorithm to achieve the interaction between the first step and the second step. Our results showcase the effective of our proposed JTOA, and the effective of the CoMP in availability improvement in HetNets.	computer simulation;genetic algorithm;haptic technology;heuristic (computer science);high availability;lagrange multiplier;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;numerical method;optimization problem;pico;software release life cycle;subcarrier	Jie Jia;Yansha Deng;Jian Chen;Abdol Hamid Aghvami;Arumugam Nallanathan	2017	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2679747	user equipment;subcarrier;genetic algorithm;high availability;latency (engineering);computer science;computer network;heuristic (computer science);cellular network;distributed computing;optimization problem	Visualization	30.801898506107875	93.22510221083694	116935

In this article, we propose a hybrid beamforming and vehicle-selection framework for vehicle-toinfrastructure communications to broadcast high-speed confidential messages. A one-dimensional roadway scenario having multiple lanes is considered, and the concept of secure region and interference-selection region is, respectively, developed for each roadside unit. We formulate an optimization problem of maximizing secrecy sumrate with the constraint of orthogonality-based vehicle selection. The original problem is then divided into two subproblems subtly. In terms of the first subproblem, we, by exploiting the orthogonality assumption, obtain a corresponding secure beamformer for each vehicle located in the secure region to reduce the interference and confidential information leakage. Based on secure beamformers, the second subproblem is changed to be a vehicle-selection problem, which is then solved by adopting hierarchical agglomerative clustering method and implemented by two proposed novel algorithms blending vehicle selection with beamformer generation. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in the respect of secrecy sumrate compared with the conventional zero-forcing beamforming using semi-orthogonal user selection algorithms. Furthermore, simulations show how our proposed algorithms resist against eavesdropping from collusive vehicles located in the same secure region by flexibly altering the size of secure region and interferenceselection according to the traffic density.	alpha compositing;beamforming;c-ran;cluster analysis;confidentiality;cyber-physical system;hierarchical clustering;information leakage;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;optimization problem;quantum lc circuit;selection algorithm;semiconductor industry;simulation;spectral leakage;video content protection system;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Dongyang Xu;Pinyi Ren;Qinghe Du;Li Sun	2016	IJDSN	10.1177/1550147716662783	simulation;telecommunications;computer security	Mobile	37.15417787284027	91.96796187574279	117117

The architecture for implementation of DSA has been proposed in IEEE 1900.4 standard. Under the IEEE 1900.4 framework, we envisage a scenario in which, the spectrum available with the WSP is inadequate to serve the aggregate demands of channels or the spectrum, from its radio access networks (RANs). Hence, a plausible solution has been sought in this work that employs and implements the notion of the Bankruptcy Game to formulate a policy decision which would certainly be agreeable to all the RANs. Maximization of proportional fairness (PF) is selected as the potential objective of the WSP. To arrive at an efficient solution that suits the objective of the WSP, we have proposed a novel heuristic namely, H_MPF and have compared the performance of the H_MPF with those of the Shapley value and simulated annealing based channel allocation (SACA) techniques considering solution quality and computational time as the performance indices.	access network;aggregate data;dyspan;expectation–maximization algorithm;fairness measure;frequency allocation;heuristic;proportionally fair;simulated annealing;time complexity	Ayan Paul;Mainak Sengupta;Madhubanti Maitra	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommuncations Systems (ANTS)	10.1109/ANTS.2015.7413621	simulation;telecommunications;operations management;business	Embedded	27.531839399833647	93.72964903775143	117415

The proposed scheme is based on the estimation of signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratios (SINRs) by antenna array measurement and using this estimate in transmission power control. Hence power control algorithms needing SINR-levels can be applied instead of the simple relay power control. The SINR estimation technique does not require any additional measurements compared to a separate adaptive beamforming and power control, since the required measurements are needed for the adaptive beamforming update. The estimation is based on the knowledge of the level of caused interference to the multiple access links in the same cell, and the utilization of relay power control commands in SINR estimation.	adaptive beamformer;algorithm;beamforming;interference (communication);relay;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;telecommunications link	Vesa Hasu;Heikki N.

We first design two transmission schemes based on the rules of regularized channel inversion (RCI) for both power splitting (PS) and time switching (TS) receiver architectures, namely, RCI-PS and RCI-TS schemes. For each scheme, we derive channel-independent expressions to approximate the secrecy sum rate and the harvested power in the large-system regime where K,N → ∞ with a fixed ratio β =K/N. Based on the large-system results, we jointly optimize the regularization parameter of the RCI and the PS ratio or the TS ratio such that the secrecy sum rate is maximized subject to an energy-harvesting constraint. We then present the tradeoff between the secrecy sum rate and the harvested power achieved by each scheme, and find that neither scheme always outperforms the other one. Motivated by this fact, we design an RCI-hybrid scheme based on the RCI and a newly proposed hybrid receiver architecture. The hybrid receiver architecture takes advantages of both the PS and TS receiver architectures. We show that the RCI-hybrid scheme outperforms both the RCI-PS and RCI-TS schemes.	approximation algorithm;confidentiality;multi-user;system analysis	Biao He;Nan Yang;Shihao Yan;Xiangyun Zhou	2016	IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing	10.1109/JSTSP.2016.2608792	telecommunications;computer science;interference;broadcasting;precoding;physical layer;wireless;computer network	Mobile	37.167948633992786	89.60399877252193	117486

8febf226202ce8f2840898c99fa18eda222831fc	performance of power allocation of relay stations for cognitive radio based cooperative communication systems		Cognitive radio (CR) allows unauthorized users to access authorized band without interfering the authorized user, thereby improving the bandwidth efficiency. In addition, cooperative communications with relay stations (RSs) can be used to improve throughput performance of 4G downlink network. In this study a cognitive radio assisted cooperation (CRAC), which combines advantages of CR and cooperative communications with RSs, is considered for resources allocation in the downlink orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) networks. Two adaptive power allocation schemes, throughput based power allocation of RS (Thr-RS) and utility based power allocation of RS (Uti-RS) are presented. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed Uti-RS allocation schemes can not only enhance throughput, but also improve fairness and utility of users for CRAC communication systems.	authorization;broadcast relay station;cosmo-rs;cognitive radio;fairness measure;frequency divider;internet relay chat;reed–solomon error correction;reflow soldering;simulation;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;throughput	Yung-Fa Huang;Tan-Hsu Tan;Yu-Shing Lee;Hsing-Chung Chen	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-61542-4_52	computer science;throughput;rss;computer network;communications system;cognitive radio;orthogonal frequency-division multiple access;telecommunications link;relay;spectral efficiency	Mobile	31.75618428361903	88.9270399160192	117645

In a CDR scheme the relay has a central role in managing the interference and boosting the overall system performance. In this letter we consider the case in which an amplify-and-forward relay has multiple antennas and can use beamforming to support the coordinated transmissions. We focus on one representative traffic type with one uplink user and one downlink user. Two different criteria for relay beamforming are analyzed: maximal weighted sum-rate and maximization of the worst-case weighted SNR. We propose iterative optimal solutions, as well as low-complexity near-optimal solutions.	beamforming;best, worst and average case;entropy maximization;expectation–maximization algorithm;interference (communication);iterative method;mathematical optimization;maximal set;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;telecommunications link;weight function	Fan Sun;Elisabeth de Carvalho;Petar Popovski;Chan Dai Truyen Thai	2012	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2012.2211588	telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;wsdma;relay channel;computer network	Mobile	35.461102355405245	89.45686826161074	118175

Moreover, ultra dense networks (UDNs) combined with mmWave technology are expected to increase both energy efficiency and spectral efficiency. In this paper, user association and power allocation in mmWave-based UDNs is considered with attention to load balance constraints, energy harvesting by base stations, user quality of service requirements, energy efficiency, and cross-tier interference limits. The joint user association and power optimization problem are modeled as a mixed-integer programming problem, which is then transformed into a convex optimization problem by relaxing the user association indicator and solved by Lagrangian dual decomposition. An iterative gradient user association and power allocation algorithm is proposed and shown to converge rapidly to an optimal point. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is analyzed and its effectiveness compared with existing methods is verified by simulations.	algorithm;cognition;converge;convex optimization;gradient;integer programming;interference (communication);iterative method;lagrangian relaxation;load balancing (computing);mathematical optimization;max;multitier architecture;network utility;non-functional requirement;numerical analysis;optimization problem;rate of convergence;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;spectral efficiency;support vector machine;user experience	H.

On one hand, the integration of cloud computing into the mobile environment enables mobile cloud computing (MCC) systems; on the other hand, the powerful computing platforms in the cloud for radio access networks lead to a novel concept of cloud radio access networks (C-RAN). In this paper, we study the topology configuration and rate allocation problem in C-RAN with the objective of optimizing the end-to-end performance of MCC users in next generation wireless networks. An intrinsic issue related to such system is that only sub-optimal decisions can be made due to the fact that the channel state information is outdated. We employ a decision-theoretic framework to tackle this issue, and maximize the system throughput with constraints on the response latency experienced by each MCC user. Using simulation results, we show that, with the emergence of MCC and C-RAN technologies, the design and operation of future mobile wireless networks can be significantly affected by cloud computing, and the proposed scheme is capable of achieving substantial performance gains over existing schemes.	access network;c-ran;channel state information;emergence;end-to-end encryption;mobile cloud computing;mobile phone;next-generation network;simulation;theory;throughput	Yegui Cai;Fei Richard Yu;Shengrong Bu	2014	2014 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)	10.1109/INFCOMW.2014.6849260	radio access network;cloud computing;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;cloud testing;distributed computing;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	25.012178106895195	90.82132002775188	118942

Then we model resource allocation problem as a noncooperative game. Based on the game, we devise a iterative algorithm called DRA that requires no coordination among the base stations. We prove that there exists a Nash equilibrium for the game and the equilibrium is unique in some constrained environment. The proposed DRA algorithm turns out to converge to the equilibrium within a small number of iterations.	centralized computing;converge;distributed algorithm;dynamic resolution adaptation;game theory;interference (communication);iteration;mathematical optimization;nash equilibrium;norm (social);utility	Hojoong Kwon;Byeong Gi Lee	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2006.255764	price of stability;implementation theory;game theory;mathematical optimization;simulation;telecommunications;extensive-form game;computer science;base station;resource management;distributed computing;normal-form game;algorithmic game theory;solution concept	Robotics	32.366552091580076	92.93138406844878	119034

However, two important challenges are introduced: 1) the underutilization for macrocell in ABS and 2) the optimal downlink association may not be optimal for uplink transmission, i.e., downlink/uplink decoupling (DUDe). In this paper, we first propose a novel method based on configuring uplink transmission in the macrocell in ABSs (UM-ABS) for eICIC to improve the efficiency of the ABS. Then, the UM-ABS and DUDe are formulated as an optimization problem of investigating the joint load balancing of downlink and uplink for eICIC in heterogeneous networks (HetNets) while considering different service classes. The problem is actually a mixed binary integer programming problem, which is difficult to solve. We provide a relaxed-rounding solution to the model. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed algorithm achieves superior performance in comparison to state-of-the-art methods in terms of system throughput and the rate gain for users.	algorithm;channel capacity;coupling (computer programming);experiment;integer programming;interference (communication);liang-jie zhang;linear programming;load balancing (computing);low-power broadcasting;mimo;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;numerical method;optimization problem;rounding;semantic network;telecommunications link;throughput;yang	Jie Zheng;Jiandong Li;Nannan Wang;Xiaoniu Yang	2017	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2016.2633480	electronic engineering;macrocell;computer network;throughput;heterogeneous network;telecommunications link;load balancing (computing);load management;computer science;optimization problem	Mobile	29.91599312988028	91.5205268362314	119503

We devise dynamic resource allocation (DRA) algorithms that can minimize the QoS violation ratio (i.e., the ratio of the number of users who fail to get the requested data rate to the total number of users in the overall network). We assume an OFDMA system that allows dynamic control of frequency reuse factor (FRF) of each sub-carrier. The proposed DRA algorithms determine the FRFs of the sub-carriers and allocate them to the users adaptively based on inter-cell interference and load distribution. In order to reduce the signaling overhead, we adopt a hierarchical resource allocation architecture which divides the resource allocation decision into the inter-cell coordinator (ICC) and the base station (BS) levels. We limit the information available at the ICC only to the load of each cell, that is, the total number of sub-carriers required for supporting the data rate requirement of all the users. We then present the DRA with limited coordination (DRA-LC) algorithm where the ICC performs load-adaptive inter-cell resource allocation with the limited information while the BS performs intra-cell resource allocation with full information about its own cell. For performance comparison, we design a centralized algorithm called DRA with full coordination (DRA-FC). Simulation results reveal that the DRA-LC algorithm can perform close to the DRA-FC algorithm at very low signaling overhead. In addition, it turns out to improve the QoS performance of the cell-boundary users, and achieve a better fairness among neighboring cells under non-uniform load distribution.	algorithm;cell (microprocessor);centralized computing;data rate units;dynamic resolution adaptation;fairness measure;frequency divider;frequency response;interference (communication);load balancing (computing);overhead (computing);simulation;subcarrier	Hojoong Kwon;Won-Ick Lee;Byeong Gi Lee	2009	Journal of Communications and Networks	10.1109/JCN.2009.6388370	real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;resource management	Metrics	29.701135972376026	89.81144844616209	119756

The purpose of resource allocation is to maximize the overall throughput, while satisfying the constraints on the individual power and the interference induced to the primary users (PUs). Additionally, different from the conventional resource allocation problem, the rate-guarantee constraints of the subcarriers are considered. We formulate the problem as a mixed integer programming task and adopt the dual decomposition technique to obtain an asymptotically optimal power allocation, subcarrier pairing and relay selection. Moreover, we further design a suboptimal algorithm that sacrifices little on performance but could significantly reduce computational complexity. Numerical simulation results confirm the optimality of the proposed algorithms and demonstrate the impact of the different constraints.	cognitive radio	Xuezhou Yang;Wei Tang;Wei Guo	2014	TIIS	10.3837/tiis.2014.07.008	mathematical optimization;real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science	Robotics	34.38788395775016	90.71414114786396	120063

To effectively manage the intercell interference, a heuristic scheme that jointly considers user scheduling and power control is proposed for multicell orthogonal frequency division multiple-access (OFDMA) networks with BS cooperation and limited backhaul capacity. First, a greedy user scheduling is proposed, taking both channel gain and the cost of directional cooperation into consideration. This scheme schedules the cell-edge users of all cells in the same subchannels. Second, under the guiding of user scheduling, the interference among cell-edge users of different cells can be preferentially cancelled with zero-forcing precoding. Third, a two-step power control is conducted to further improve cell-edge users performance. In the first step, with the strong duality of the nonconvex optimization subproblem, we obtain the minimum power consumption that guaranteeing the cellcenter users' rate requirement. In the second step, the residual power of per cell can be utilized to maximize cell-edge users performance. Then, with the fixed user scheduling, the iteration among interference cancelation and power control can be conducted until the backhaul capacity constraints are satisfied. Performance analysis proves the convergence of the proposed algorithm, and shows the effectiveness of the user scheduling. Simulation results show that, the proposed algorithm achieves a significant improvement of sum-rate for cell-edge users with negligible rate degradation for cell-center users.	backhaul (telecommunications);elegant degradation;frequency divider;greedy algorithm;heuristic;interference (communication);iteration;mathematical optimization;multi-user mimo;scheduling (computing);simulation;strong duality;zero-forcing precoding	Hao Xu;Pinyi Ren	2013	2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666348	fair-share scheduling;multi-user mimo;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;power control;computer science;radio resource management;scheduling;precoding;computer network	Mobile	31.89277215287666	90.92435180248779	120098
f7b899bc4609cd0b29716708dcdbcb92d2a7cdbf	joint cache placement and beamforming design for scalable videos in c-ran		This paper investigates the joint optimization of layered caching and beamforming design for scalable videos delivered by Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP in the multicell cloud radio access network. To transmit differential scalable videos, each video is divided into a base layer and a set of enhancement layers based on scalable video coding. Taking the layered property of scalable videos into account, we propose a layered caching scheme, i.e., multiple layers of different scalable videos are cached in the baseband unit pool and the cache-enabled cluster respectively, which alleviates the burden of backhaul links effectively. Since the quality of videos received by each user depends on the available bandwidth, the appropriate scalable videos are provided for users based on the transmission rates. To provide superior video quality for users, we aim to maximize the sum rate for users accessing the remote radio heads and regard the backhaul consumption as a quality of service constraint explicitly. Then, the weighted sum rate maximization problem is formulated, which can be converted into a quadratically constrained quadratic programming problem through the l0-norm approximation technique and the weighted minimum mean square error approach. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme.	approximation;backhaul (telecommunications);baseband;beamforming;binary-coded decimal;c-ran;cpu cache;cache (computing);data compression;dynamic adaptive streaming over http;expectation–maximization algorithm;hypertext transfer protocol;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;numerical method;quadratic programming;quadratically constrained quadratic program;quality of service;radio access network;requirement;scalability;scalable video coding;simulation;weight function	Mingfeng Ma;Tiejun Lv;Xuewei Zhang	2018	2018 15th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)	10.1109/ISWCS.2018.8491057	computer network;quality of service;cache;dynamic adaptive streaming over http;radio access network;scalable video coding;computer science;beamforming;video quality;backhaul (telecommunications)	Mobile	29.71764100781085	93.34566664715193	120271

The proposed RRM framework is applied in a centralised Cognitive Radio (CR) network architecture, where exploitation of the available TVWS by Secondary Systems is orchestrated via a Spectrum Broker. Efficient RRM framework performance, as a matter of maximum-possible resources utilization and benefit of Spectrum Broker, is achieved by proposing, implementing and evaluating an auction-based algorithm. This auction-based algorithm considers both frequency and time domain during TVWS allocation process which is defined as an optimization problem, where maximum payoff of Spectrum Broker is the optimization goal. Experimental tests that were carried-out under controlled conditions environment, verified the validity of the proposed framework, besides identifying fields for further research.	algorithm;centralisation;cognitive radio;mathematical optimization;network architecture;optimization problem;performance evaluation;prototype;radio resource management;white spaces (radio)	Athina Bourdena;George Mastorakis;Evangelos Pallis;Constandinos X.

We seek to design constellations that minimize the average electrical power, average optical power and peak optical power for a given minimum Euclidean distance between constellation points. The constellation design is formulated as a nonconvex optimization problem with a convex cost function, nonconvex quadratic constraints and second-order cone constraints. It is shown that this problem can be approximated by a second-order cone programming (SOCP) problem. We propose an iterative procedure in which the SOCP approximation is refined in each iteration. The new constellations are compared to the state-of-the-art constellations in terms of power efficiency. Our 32- and 64-point constellations outperform the corresponding QAM-based and face-centered cubic lattice constellations.	approximation algorithm;convex optimization;cubic function;euclidean distance;iteration;iterative method;loss function;mathematical optimization;modulation;optimization problem;performance per watt;second-order cone programming;subcarrier	Marko Beko;Rui Dinis;Miroslava Raspopovic;Vlatko Lipovac;Dzenan Strujic	2014	2014 International Conference on Telecommunications and Multimedia (TEMU)	10.1109/TEMU.2014.6917758	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;mathematics;optics	EDA	40.22331254031964	90.11063190213882	120415

Optimization approaches to spectrum sensing to-date have largely focused on maximizing throughput for secondary users while considering only a single parameter variable pertinent to sensing - notably the threshold or duration, but not both. In this work, we investigate the impact of true joint minimization under two performance criteria: a) minimization of the average time to detection of a spectrum hole and b) joint maximization of the aggregate opportunistic throughput. We show that the resulting non-convex problem is actually biconvex under practical conditions for which effective algorithms can be developed that yields reliable numerical procedures to solve the resulting optimization problem. The results show that the proposed approach can considerably improve system performance (in terms of the mean time to detect a spectrum hole and also the aggregate opportunistic throughput of both primary and secondary users), relative to the scenarios with only a single sensing variable or a sub-optimal ad-hoc optimization approach used for two variable case.	aggregate data;biconvex optimization;cognitive radio;convex optimization;emoticon;expectation–maximization algorithm;hoc (programming language);mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimization problem;relevance;throughput	Ling Luo;Sumit Roy	2012	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2012.072612.100605	mathematical optimization;cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;computer performance;statistics;computer network	Mobile	34.16292685084435	88.74745519360594	120460

These radios offer tremendous new capabilities, including high data rates and automatic traffic relay, but have large electromagnetic spectrum requirements. We explore the challenges faced by a spectrum manager in allocating the minimum number of channels to support communications for military forces conducting tactical operations. In previous work, we identified the vast computational challenges of solving this problem when considering the effects of cumulative co-channel interference. We present a new method to solve this problem using heuristic, integer optimization, and constraint programming techniques. We apply our methods to realistic data sets from a large U.S. Marine Corps combat scenario, and provide detailed performance results. We also outline our plan for further developing this method to consider multiple time steps. To our knowledge, we are the first to describe an algorithm for solving a realistic, large-scale interference-aware minimum-order channel assignment problem to global or near-global optimality.	algorithm;assignment problem;computation;constraint programming;experiment;frequency allocation;heuristic;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);irreducibility;mathematical optimization;purchasing;relay;requirement;rugged computer	Paul J.

The CPLD scheduler considers the condition of the physical channel and the length of packets at the same time, and optimally allocates the subcarriers in a frame. With this scheduler the system can achieve better system BER performance, and correspondingly superior PER performance. The system throughput is improved, at the same time the required bandwidth is guaranteed, and long term fairness for all the traffic in the system is provided. In order to reduce the algorithm complexity, a simplified CPLD is proposed, which maintains the system throughput as in the original scheduler, and guarantees the system performance with properly set system parameters. The superior performance of the proposed scheduler is demonstrated by simulation results.	algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);complex programmable logic device;fairness measure;generalized processor sharing;multiplexing;network packet;network scheduler;scheduling (computing);simulation;subcarrier;throughput;x.690	Zhifeng Diao;Dongxu Shen;Victor O.

db22602d9310ac1367114d0e9224f8e654265072	resource allocation for heterogeneous radio-frequency and visible-light networks	qa75 electronic computers computer science	In recent years, mobile data traffic demands have been increased exponentially, and the conventional cellular systems can no longer support the capacity demands. A potential solution for meeting such demands may be Heterogeneous Network (HetNet) techniques. A HetNet may integrate diverse radio access technologies (RAT) such as UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Networks (UTRAN), GSM/EDGE Radio Access and Network (GERAN), Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) as well as possibly Visible Light Communication (VLC) networks. The improved channel gain of the HetNet techniques is achieved by employing the small cells and by reduced transmission distance. However, the deployment of HetNet techniques also impose several technical challenges, for example the interference management, handovers, resource management and modelling of HetNets.#R##N##R##N#A HetNet relies on multiple types of access nodes in a wireless network. These access nodes can use either the same technology or different technologies. When the access nodes employ the same technology and use the same frequency band, a major problem is the Co-Channel-Interference (CCI) between these access nodes. We firstly investigate a Radio-Frequency (RF) based HetNet in Chapter 3, which is constituted by the macrocells and the femtocells. More explicitly, the impacts of femtocells on traditional macrocells are studied, when the macrocells are relying on Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR). The design, performance analysis and optimization problems of this FFR aided two-tier HetNet is investigated. We found the advantage of FFR eroded in dense femtocell scenarios and the optimized network tends to become a Unity Frequency Reuse (UFR) aided system. In order to mitigate the cross-tier interference, we proposed a statics spectrum allocation scheme, namely Swapping Spectrum Access (SSA). Both the Outage Probability (OP) of femtocell Mobile Terminals (MTs) in cell centre region and that of the macrocell MTs in the cell edge region is reduced by the proposed SSA. The optimized network using our SSA is more robust to the detrimental impact of femtocells.#R##N##R##N#Another constitution of a HetNet may rely on integrating different technologies of wireless communication networks. We focus on our attentions on a HetNet composing by a RF femtocell and a VLC network in Chapter 4 and 5. An important component of this architecture is its Resource Management (RM). We investigate the Resource Allocation (RA) problems, under the diverse quality of service (QoS) requirements in terms of data rate, fairness and the statistical delay requirements. Two types of MTs, multi-homing MTs and multi-mode MTs are considered, where multi-homing MTs have the capability of aggregating resources from different networks, while the multi-mode MTs always select a single network for their connection. We proposed a sub-optimal decentralized method for solving the RA problems of both the multi-homing MTs and multi-mode MTs. The simulation results confirm the conceived method is capable of satisfying the QoS requirements. Furthermore, we employ more sophisticated transmission strategies for the VLC network and study their performance in Chapter 5. Again, the RA problems of the HetNet relying on different transmission strategies are investigated.	radio frequency	Fan Jin	2015			simulation;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	Theory	26.274192808049698	89.1577960734724	120993

Such heterogeneity typically arises in wireless networks (e.g., servers may represent frequency bands, and the service rate of a user varies across bands). Users select servers in a distributed manner. They initially attach to an arbitrary server. However, at random instants of time, they may probe the load at a new server and migrate there to improve their service rate. We analyze the system dynamics under the natural Random Local Search (RLS) migration scheme, introduced in [5]. Under this scheme, when a user has the opportunity to switch servers, she does it only if this improves her service rate. The dynamics under RLS may be interpreted as those generated by strategic players updating their strategy in a load balancing game. We show that this game has pure Nash Equilibriums (NEs), and we analyze their efficiency. We further prove that when the user population grows large, pure NEs get closer to a Proportionally Fair (PF) allocation of users to servers, and we characterize the gap between equilibriums and this ideal allocation depending on user population. Under the RLS algorithm, the system converges to pure NEs: we study the time it takes for the system to reach the PF allocation within a certain margin.	algorithm;frequency band;load balancing (computing);nash equilibrium;proportionally fair;recursive least squares filter;server (computing);system dynamics	SeYoung Yun;Alexandre Proutière	2014	2014 48th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)	10.1109/CISS.2014.6814133	games;game theory;parallel processing;real-time computing;simulation;economics;resource allocation;computer science;resource management;wireless network;distributed computing;system dynamics;queueing theory;server;statistics;recursive least squares filter	Metrics	28.283990354710614	100.83040197989875	121015

We consider the robust secrecy rate maximization problem subject to the transmit power and the EH constraints by incorporating the norm-bounded channel uncertainty. This robust optimization problem is not convex, and thus, it can be reformulated as a convex one along with matrix transformations and convex conic optimization techniques, which is iteratively solved based on constrained concave-convex procedure-based algorithm.

Traffic in opposite directions over two wireless hops can utilize the advantage of network coding (NC) in order to decrease the number of transmissions used. We call such coded hops as “NC-links”. On the other hand, the multicast (MC) links can transmit data to several nodes at the same time, also yielding the improvement of the transmissions efficiency. However, there exists a certain level of ambiguity regarding how to coordinate NC and MC to improve the file sharing performance in wireless P2P content distribution systems. Considering both NC and MC gains, we investigate the content traffic splitting using the theory of a potential game and show that there is competition among destinations in order to minimize the total system transmission cost. Subsequently, we identify the equilibrium solution to this game and develop a two-level distributed control algorithm that allows each destination to select the source and split the traffic so as to adjust the content traffic based on the potential function in a distributed way. Through theoretical analysis and simulation results, we show that the proposed scheme is stable and effective.	digital distribution;distributed algorithm;distributed control system;file sharing;game theory;gradient descent;linear network coding;multicast;multipath propagation;numerical method;peer-to-peer;simulation	Dapeng Li;Guanglin Zhang;Feng Tian;Haitao Zhao	2015	2015 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference Workshops (WCNCW)	10.1109/WCNCW.2015.7122577	games;linear network coding;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;wireless network;distributed computing;wi-fi array;wireless;computer network	Mobile	26.593992558832664	95.20385570561315	121134

Among various DSM techniques, centralized optimal spectrum balancing (OSB) achieves the maximum possible data rates by computing the optimal power spectral densities (PSDs) for all modems in DSL systems. Unfortunately, its computational complexity grows exponentially in the number of users and becomes intractable for large . To reduce the complexity of OSB, this paper exploits the fact that the non-convex optimization problem in OSB can be reformulated as an equivalent global concave minimization problem by representing its objective function explicitly as the difference of two convex functions (dc). This dc structure makes the non-convex optimization problem in OSB suitable for being solved by various dc algorithms developed over the decades. In particular, a modified prismatic branch-and-bound algorithm, which only requires solving a sequence of linear programming subproblems, is applied to find the global optimum with substantial reduction in complexity especially for large .	algorithm;branch and bound;brute-force search;central processing unit;centralized computing;computational complexity theory;convex function;convex optimization;crosstalk;decibel;digital subscriber line;global optimization;linear programming;mathematical optimization;modem;multi-user;optimization problem;oracle enterprise service bus;oracle service bus;simulation;time complexity	Tho Le-Ngoc;Saswat Panigrahi	2008	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2008.917378	mathematical optimization;digital subscriber line;telecommunications;computer science;linear programming;mathematics	EDA	36.667260272028365	91.14160260117244	121157

This paper investigates effective cell association schemes for LB. Considering the centralized cellular network architecture with Super Base Stations (SBS), a centralized cell association scheme is proposed, where the calculations are all performed in the SBS and information exchange within the SBS is convenient. There is also no need for the users to feed back information. Thus the signaling overhead is reduced a lot. Moreover, to alleviate the sensitiveness to load changes, the load fairness index (LFI) is defined. The proposed scheme is not performed until the LFI is lower than a given threshold. It is verified by simulations that the proposed centralized cell association scheme can adjust the cell-specific bias according to the cell load and provide better geometry mean rate (GMR) and outage probability (OP) over the comparing schemes. Moreover, with the introduction of LFI, the number of LB performed can be effectively reduced with a lower LFI threshold, however, the system performance such as GMR and OP also degrades. Therefore, an appropriate LFI threshold is needed to balance the system performance and complexity.	centralized computing;complexity;computer performance;fairness measure;file inclusion vulnerability;game theory;information exchange;lattice boltzmann methods;load balancing (computing);network architecture;overhead (computing);semantic network;simulation;smart battery system;sun outage	Hongyan Du;Yiqing Zhou;Lin Tian;Xiaodong Wang;Zhengang Pan;Jinglin Shi;Yao Yuan	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2015.7248648	real-time computing;heterogeneous network;telecommunications;computer science;load balancing;computer network	Robotics	26.50286038321042	90.99628520022637	121312

3073834e64d6d1216a574e45f8f72cc1b48b48c7	optimal resource allocation with heterogeneous qos provisioning for wireless powered sensor networks		In this paper, we develop the resource allocation scheme with heterogeneous statistical QoS provisioning for wireless powered sensor networks (WPSNs). In particular, we build up the downlink energy transfer and heterogeneous statistical QoS provisioning uplink data transmission models, where the aggregate effective capacity (AEC) is defined as the aggregate throughput under the statistical QoS constraints, for WPSNs. Based on the models, we formulate the AEC maximization problem to jointly optimize the downlink energy assignment and uplink power control scheme. To efficiently solve this problem, we divide it into the hybrid access point determined downlink energy assignment problem and the sensor node determined uplink power control problem, solving which yields the joint downlink energy assignment and uplink power control scheme. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed heterogeneous QoS-driven resource allocation scheme. The obtained results show that the heterogeneous QoSdriven resource allocation scheme can significantly increase the AEC as compared with the homogeneous QoS-driven resource allocation scheme.	aggregate data;assignment problem;expectation–maximization algorithm;provisioning;quality of service;rain fade;sensor node;simulation;telecommunications link;throughput;wireless access point	Ya Gao;Wenchi Cheng;Hailin Zhang;Yuquan Li	2017	GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8253949	power control;quality of service;computer network;wireless sensor network;throughput;computer science;telecommunications link;resource management;sensor node;resource allocation	Embedded	31.224680723349845	90.83218952699268	121944

In that case, the users are directed to the macro-cell base station (MBS) in order to satisfy the service quality requirement. Coded caching is exploited here to minimize the amount of data downloaded from the MBS, taking into account the mobility of the users as well as the popularity of the contents. An optimal distributed caching policy is presented when the delay deadline is below a certain threshold, and a distributed greedy caching policy is proposed when the delay deadline is relaxed.

Interference management in the spatial domain through beamforming allows for increased reuse without having to sacrifice resources in the time or frequency domain. Existing beamforming techniques for spatial reuse, being coupled with client scheduling, face a key limitation in practical realization, especially with OFDMA small cells. In this context, we argue that for a practical spatial reuse system with beamforming, it is important to decouple beamforming from client scheduling. Further, we show that jointly addressing client association with beamforming is critical to maximizing the reuse potential of beamforming. Towards our goal, we propose ProBeam - a system for multi-cell beamforming and client association in OFDMA small cell networks. ProBeam incorporates two key components - a low complexity, highly accurate SINR estimation module that helps determine interference dependencies for beamforming between small cells; and an efficient, low complexity joint client association and beam selection algorithm for the small cells that accounts for scheduling at the small cells without being coupled with it. We have prototyped ProBeam on a WiMAX-based network of four small cells. Our evaluations reveal the accuracy of our SINR estimation module to be within 1 dB, and the reuse gains from joint client association and beamforming to be as high as 115 percent over baseline approaches.	baseline (configuration management);beamforming;interference (communication);next-generation network;scheduling (computing);selection algorithm;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;spectral efficiency	Jongwon Yoon;Karthikeyan Sundaresan;Mohammad Ali Amir Khojastepour;Sampath Rangarajan;Suman Banerjee	2016	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2015.2496586	wimax;estimation;throughput;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;wsdma;interference;small cell;beamforming;signal-to-noise ratio;mobile computing	Mobile	27.750709362040965	89.78170004917204	122461
6b0a99b2a375854fb0f1a7a88d096f501c6f4482	a contract based approach for electric vehicles charging in heterogeneous networks		With the help of mobile charging stations (MCSs), the charging service of electric vehicles (EVs) can be provided more easily with higher payoff and lower consumption, compared with the fixed charging stations (FCSs). Although many traditional approaches have been used to decide the pricing plans for FCSs, it can not be efficient to design the optimal pricing strategy for MCSs. In this paper, we propose a contract-based scheme to solve the problem of supplying power service to EV users. Firstly, considering quality of service (QoS) and mobility of MCS in the heterogeneous networks, we study and develop the utility function based on the relationship for MCS and EV users. Then, the charging problem for EV users is formulated as an optimization problem through the contract theory. Thirdly, we present the iterative algorithm to achieve the optimal solution. Our simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

We propose a new spread-spectrum management paradigm, in which, unlike mainstream dynamic spectrum access research, digital waveforms are designed to occupy the entire available spectrum, and to adaptively track the interference profile at the receiver to maximize the link capacity while avoiding interference to primary users. In this context, we study the problem of maximizing the network throughput of a multi-hop network through joint routing and spread-spectrum channelization. We first propose a centralized formulation of the network control problem. We then propose an algorithm that can be seen as a distributed localized approximation of the throughput-maximizing policy. We refer to the proposed jointly-designed routing and code-division channelization algorithm as ROCH (Routing and cOde-division CHannelization). Specifically, power and spreading code are jointly selected to maximize the pre-detection secondary \mathrm{SINR} while providing quality of service guarantees to on-going primary and secondary transmissions, while the routing algorithm dynamically selects relays based on the network traffic dynamics and on the achievable data rates on different secondary links. We study the throughput and delay performance of ROCH through a extensive simulation experiments, which demonstrate the appeal of the proposed framework through significant performance gains compared to baseline solutions.	algorithm;approximation;baseline (configuration management);centralized computing;channelization (telecommunications);coexist (image);cognitive network;cognitive radio;constrained optimization;constraint (mathematics);convex function;distributed control system;experiment;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);mathematical optimization;np-hardness;network packet;optimization problem;programming paradigm;quality of service;relay;routing;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;throughput	Lei Ding;Kanke Gao;Tommaso Melodia;Stella N.

This paper introduces stochastic resource allocation algorithms for both interweave (also known as overlay) and underlay cognitive radio paradigms. The algorithms are designed to maximize the weighted sum-rate of orthogonally transmitting secondary users under average-power and probabilistic interference constraints. The latter are formulated either as short- or as long-term constraints, and guarantee that the probability of secondary transmissions interfering with primary receivers stays below a certain pre-specified level. When the resultant optimization problem is non-convex, it exhibits zero-duality gap and thus, due to a favorable structure in the dual domain, it can be solved efficiently. The optimal schemes leverage CSI of the primary and secondary networks, as well as the Lagrange multipliers associated with the constraints. Analysis and simulated tests confirm the merits of the novel algorithms in: i) accommodating time-varying settings through stochastic approximation iterations; and ii) coping with imperfect CSI.	catastrophic interference;channel state information;cognitive radio;duality gap;expectation–maximization algorithm;functional programming;interference (communication);iteration;lagrange multiplier;mathematical optimization;memory management;optimization problem;requirement;resultant;statistical interference;stochastic approximation;transmitter;weight function	Antonio Garcia Marques;Luis M.

1f7b6e370c1bd7c3032250db7cb0849793ce4483	joint source-relay secure precoding for mimo relay networks with direct links		In this paper, we propose a joint source-relay precoding scheme to secure an amplify-and-forward multiple-input multiple-output wireless relay network in the existence of a multi-antenna eavesdropper. Different from existing works that only consider some specific signal design to simplify the problem, we take both the direct links from the source to the destination and to the eavesdropper into account, and investigate the general joint signal covariance matrices optimization problem to maximize the secrecy rate, which leads to a difficult non-convex optimization problem. To handle it, we propose a group alternating optimization algorithm to find a solution, which alternately optimizes the signal covariance matrix and the linear precoding matrix at the source and the relay, respectively. For optimizing the linear precoding matrix at the relay, the problem is still non-convex, and we propose a minorization–maximization (MM) method to handle it. The MM method transforms the original non-convex problem into a series of convex problems and guarantees the convergence of a local optimum. For optimizing the signal covariance matrix at the source, we reveal the convex–concave property of the problem, and find its global optimum using a barrier method combined with the Newton iteration. We also provide an initialization method to trigger the algorithm and analyze the convergence and complexity. The numerical results show the computational efficiency and the prominent performance of the proposed algorithm.	complexity;computation;concave function;convex optimization;expectation–maximization algorithm;global optimization;interior point method;iteration;local optimum;mimo;mathematical optimization;newton's method;numerical analysis;optimization problem;relay	Hui-Ming Wang;Ke-Wen Huang;Qian Yang;Zhu Han	2017	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2686870	control theory;local optimum;mimo;electronic engineering;covariance matrix;computer science;relay;mathematical optimization;precoding;covariance;optimization problem;zero-forcing precoding	ML	37.57689454572896	90.38097628393963	123247

In this paper, we investigate the joint resource block allocation and link adaptation problem with CA in LTE-A dwonlink. The problem is formulated as an Integer Programming problem aimed at maximizing the cell throughtput while guaranteeing Quality of Service (QoS) of each User Equipment (UE), in the form of the minimum transmission rate. We also consider the proportional fairness of radio allocation among UEs. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, we propose an efficient algorithm QA-PFRA. QA-PFRA consists of two phases. In the first one we assign radio resource to UEs successively for QoS requirements according to UEs' priority, and in the second one we assign CCs to other UEs to maximize the cell weighted throughput. We develop a simulator to evaluate the performance of QA-PFRA. For comparison, we also implement GA algorithm and ERAA algorithm. It is found that the cell throughput obtained by QA-PFRA is about 70 higher than that obtained by ERAA, and QA-PFRA can also achieve higher throughput compared with GA when the UEs are sparsely distributed in the cell. Furthermore, we can observe that Jain's fairness index obtained by QA-PFRA is about 10 higher than that obtained by GA and 40 higher than that obtained by ERAA.	algorithm;compaq lte;fairness measure;integer programming;np-hardness;proportionally fair;qa & ux manager;quality of service;requirement;simulation;software quality assurance;software release life cycle;throughput	Peisheng Yan;Xin Chen;Zhuo Li;Yudong Jia	2016	2016 12th International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Networks (MSN)	10.1109/MSN.2016.024	computer network;user equipment;quality of service;lte advanced;throughput;link adaptation;computer science;real-time computing;telecommunications link;integer programming;resource allocation	Mobile	27.672156242834212	92.65695325810279	123310
cad05c1aee23749e3037ecb9cff3b28fe90a89fd	energy aware optimal resource allocation in backhaul constraint wireless networks: a two base stations scenario		In future wireless communication systems, the capacity constrained backhaul gradually becomes bottleneck both in spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency, especially in joint processing of LTE-Advanced. This paper addresses the issue of energy aware resource allocation with limited backhaul capacity in uplink cooperative reception, where two base stations (BSs) equipped with single-antenna each serving multiple users with single-antenna via multicarrier are considered. We propose a novel energy efficient cooperative scheme based on compress-and-forward and user pairing to solve the problem in two base stations scenario. In order to maximize system throughput and increase energy efficiency under the limited backhaul capacity constraint, we formulate the joint optimization problem of user pairing, subcarrier mapping, and backhaul capacity sharing between different pairs (subcarriers). An energy efficient algorithm based on alternating optimization strategy and perfect mapping is proposed to solve this mixed integer programming problem. Simulations show that this allocation algorithm can improve the system capacity and energy efficiency significantly compared with the blind alternatives.	backhaul (telecommunications)	Yuan Gao;Peng Xue;Yi Li;Hongyi Yu;Xianfeng Wang;Shihai Gao	2015	IJDSN	10.1155/2015/472169	mathematical optimization;telecommunications;computer network	ECom	31.14260513357414	91.59549422107037	123591

LTE-A enhancements focus on the four areas of capacity, coverage, inter-cells coordination, and cost. Improvements in these areas are based on using several technologies. Multiple-Input Multiple Output/Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (MIMO/OFDMA) are two of the base technologies that will act as enablers. In this paper, we motivate the importance of intertechnologies and inter-entities cooperation, which can exploit heterogeneity as an enabler to improve the system capacity as well as the quality of service (QoS) for users. We present a new cooperative radio resource allocation scheme for LTE-A network to coordinate better utilization of network's available radio resources. We adopted the the 802.21 Media Independent Handover protocol (MIH) framework, in order to facilitate the exchange between heterogeneous network entities so as to insure self-configuration of radio resource management parameters. We worked on allocating the right PRB to the right user at the right time. We also analyzed some existing solutions and evaluate our proposed scheme using simulation analysis. Simulation results illustrate the performance gains brought by the proposed optimizations, especially for average throughput of macro-cell users comparing to their initial performance within two-tier LTE-A network.	channel capacity;compaq lte;entity;interference (communication);internet of things;mimo;multitier architecture;pseudorandom binary sequence;quality of service;radio resource management;simulation;throughput	Houda Mzoughi;Faouzi Zarai;Lotfi Kamoun	2016	2016 22nd Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC)	10.1109/APCC.2016.7581465	cellular network;real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering;radio resource management;computer network	Mobile	26.532359319788227	89.27155025565267	123715

Both the transmitters and receivers are equipped with multiple antennas. First, we derive an upper bound on the sum-rate capacity of the MIMO XC under individual power constraint at each transmitter. The sum-rate capacity of the two-user multiple access channel (MAC) that results when receiver cooperation is assumed forms an upper bound on the sum-rate capacity of the MIMO XC. We tighten this bound by considering noise correlation between the receivers and deriving the worst noise covariance matrix. It is shown that the worst noise covariance matrix is a saddle-point of a zero-sum, two-player convex-concave game, which is solved through a primal-dual interior point method that solves the maximization and the minimization parts of the problem simultaneously. Next, we propose an achievable scheme which employs dirty paper coding at the transmitters and successive decoding at the receivers. We show that the derived upper bound is close to the achievable region of the proposed scheme at low to medium SNRs.	approximation;concave function;expectation–maximization algorithm;hessian;interior point method;mimo;mimo-ofdm;minimax;transmitter	Ranga Prasad;N.

It is considered a promising solution to improve communication performance and network capacity of LTE-Advanced system. In addition, the direct proximity communication implies reduced delay and energy consumption. However, from the perspective of D2D networks, co-existence of multiple D2D User Equipments (UEs) is a challenging issue because of the proximity interference management, especially, without a central controller in a distributed scheme. In this article, we propose a novel distributed power control and collision resolution schemes, which can enhance discovery success of proximity devices conforming to LTE-A networks.

Resource partitioning between user and relay links, as well as configuration of relay cells is discussed. The problem of optimum allocation of resources from the available component carriers is analyzed from the end user performance point of view. In this paper the centralized network configuration scheme is utilized, i.e. the macro station controls resource assignment for all types of stations and links within its coverage area. For this scheme several carrier load balancing methods are investigated. The methods differ in criteria included in the decision process, starting from a purely random allocation and extending to a joint signal quality and load oriented approach. The methods are evaluated first by means of theoretical estimations, and later by system level simulations. The evaluations are done in the direction of two performance metrics, namely mean user throughput and uniformity of user throughputs across network. The conclusion from the conducted analysis is that most of the advanced balancing methods (i.e. not blind random) can provided significant performance uniformity improvements in the order of 10%, as well as mean performance gains of 2%. We note that in practical implementation, the selection of a specific method should also be based on the availability of required measurements.	allocative efficiency;centralized computing;circuit complexity;fairness measure;load balancing (computing);point of view (computer hardware company);relay;simulation;throughput	Jacek Gora;Adrian Bohdanowicz	2011	2011 Future Network & Mobile Summit		real-time computing;engineering;distributed computing;computer network	Metrics	25.264300428330042	88.64218680963518	124170

Rate allocation is performed on a per-frame basis; whereas within the frame, power control is performed at the symbol basis. A hierarchical rate allocation scheme is proposed, which together with the utility-based power control and the opportunistic fair scheduling scheme, maximizes the instantaneous weighted system throughput and the number of feasible users, and at the same time, guarantees the fairness among all users. In order to apply such a resource allocation framework to systems employing blind multiuser detection, we make use of the recent analytical results on the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio performance of the blind multiuser detectors, assuming multiple spreading codes are used to realize multiple data rates. Our results show that under the utility-based joint power and rate allocation framework, the system capacity is significantly enhanced by using blind multiuser detection and the fairness can be well guaranteed.	algorithm;channel capacity;code;fair-share scheduling;fairness measure;interference (communication);matched filter;multi-user;scheduling (computing);sensor;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;telecommunications link;throughput	Chuxiang Li;Xiaodong Wang;Daryl Reynolds	2005	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2005.846984	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;matched filter;utility	Mobile	34.223771212283246	89.65598675247146	124220

So far, most proposed opportunistic scheduling policies for ad hoc networks exploit local multiuser diversity, i.e., each transmitter selects its best receiver independently. However, due to co-channel interference, the decisions of neighboring transmitters are highly correlated. Furthermore, the neighboring links without a common sender also experience independent channel fading. Taking the contention relationship and the channel diversity among links into account, we extend the concept of multi-user diversity to a more generalized one, by which a set of senders cooperatively schedule the instantaneously and globally best out-going links, thus the spatial diversity of the channel variation can be further exploited. In this paper, we formulate the opportunistic scheduling problem with fairness requirements into an optimization problem and present its optimal solution, i.e., the optimal scheduling policy. We also propose GOS, a distributed Graph theory based and Opportunistic Scheduling algorithm, which modifies IEEE 802.11 protocol to implement the optimal scheduling policy. Theoretical analysis and simulation results both verify that our implementation achieves higher network throughput and provides better fairness support than the existing algorithms.	crew scheduling;distributed algorithm;fairness measure;geographical operations system;graph theory;greedy algorithm;hoc (programming language);independent set (graph theory);interference (communication);mathematical optimization;multi-user;open-shop scheduling;optimization problem;overhead (computing);requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput;transmitter	Qian Zhang;Zhisheng Niu	2009	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2009.070311	fair-share scheduling;wireless ad hoc network;telecommunications;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;graph theory;distributed computing;round-robin scheduling;computer network	Mobile	34.012270386061054	89.48895562746509	124629

Moreover, the fleeting nature of the available spectrum also hinders the communication as the radios must relinquish the acquired channels once the primary users of those channels return. In this paper, we propose a performance metrics based data channel allocation scheme for IEEE 802.22 networks where the base station allocates interference free channels to the consumer premise equipments using a spectrum map. The base station creates the spectrum map by using the raw spectrum usage data that are shared by a small subset of consumer premise equipments. The usage data are fused at the base station using a modified version of Shepard's interpolation technique. We construct a continuous and differentiable spatial distribution of spectrum usage that the base station consults to estimate the spectrum occupancy vector at any arbitrary location in its cell. Such spectrum usage is then utilized to proactively evaluate some key network and radio performance metrics which in turn help allocating the best candidate channel to a given consumer premise equipment ensuring highest achievable performance.	algorithm;channel (communications);cognitive radio;emoticon;experiment;interference (communication);interpolation;simulation;spectral density estimation;usage data	Saptarshi Debroy;Shameek Bhattacharjee;Mainak Chatterjee	2011	2011 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2011.6140036	spectrum;cognitive radio;telecommunications;interpolation;resource allocation;computer science;base station;computer network	Embedded	26.848204700108255	89.52449362928166	124857

Conventional schemes were proposed to optimize the system performance, such as bandwidth efficiency, bit error rate (BER), and etc. However, these schemes could result in the unfairness in resource allocation. Thus, in this work, a new resource allocation algorithm based on weighted round robin (WRR) is proposed to conquer this unfairness, improve the system throughput and maintain the queueing length of each individual stream to a predefined region. Meanwhile, combining the adaptive assignment in diverse subchannels not only augments the bandwidth efficiency but also suboptimizes the entire performance in the environment with the limited resource. The ability of maintaining the queueing length could guarantee the queueing delay according to Little's law. This feature makes the proposed approach suitable for delay constraint services.

Therefore, we propose an energy-aware dynamic network provisioning framework for realizing green mobile cellular systems by reducing energy consumption in access networks. Proposed mechanism allows base stations (BSs) to offload their entire traffic to the neighbors and thus allows some BSs to switch into sleep mode for saving energy. Four different traffic offloading schemes for redistributing users among the neighboring BSs are proposed and investigated. Flexible resource allocation is integrated in the system for maintaining quality of service (QoS) throughout the network. Furthermore, for avoiding the high complexity of the formulated generalized energy optimization problem, a heuristically guided algorithmic framework is developed. System performance is evaluated using extensive simulations demonstrating a substantial energy savings. Impact of the proposed network provisioning framework on the bandwidth utilization is also analyzed.	access network;computational complexity theory;heuristic;horseland;lh (complexity);mathematical optimization;mobile phone;optimization problem;provisioning;quality of service;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;sleep mode;smart battery system	Md.

In this paper we study different multiobjective metaheuristics to address the Frequency Assignment problem (FAP). In fact, solving optimization problems with multiple (often conflicting) objectives is, generally, a very difficult goal. This is the scenario in the FAP, where it is sought an assignment of frequencies to a number of transmitters in as efficient way as possible. The multiobjective FAP tries to minimize the number of interferences caused when a limited number of frequencies needs to be assigned to a high number of transceivers. Besides these interferences costs, the separation costs are also considered. Our approach uses a Multiobjective Variable Neighborhood Search (MOVNS) algorithm and also its variant Multiobjective Skewed Variable Neighborhood Search (MO-SVNS). Two real-world GSM networks were used, currently being in operation, to test the presented metaheuristics.	alfa (xacml);algorithm;assignment problem;experiment;face animation parameter;interference (communication);linear combination of atomic orbitals;mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;multi-objective optimization;nanosat mo framework;optimization problem;reduced cost;transceiver;transmitter;variable neighborhood search	Marisa da Silva Maximiano;Miguel A.

Given the inherent complexity of the corresponding joint optimization problem, in this paper we propose an approach where we treat the problem in three consecutive phases. First, the subcarrier allocation in terms of number of subcarriers allocated per user is obtained, by adopting a multilateral bargaining model, i.e. Rubinstein's bargaining model. Then, different realistic subcarrier mapping policies are proposed, towards determining the specific subcarrier assignment. Subsequently, an optimization problem with respect to user's uplink transmission power is formulated and solved, in order to determine the optimal power allocation per subcarrier assigned to each user in the previous phases. Emphasizing on energy efficiency, users' satisfaction is formulated through a properly defined utility-based framework that reflects the tradeoff between users' actual uplink throughput performance and their corresponding energy consumption. The performance evaluation of the proposed approach is achieved via modeling and simulation, and its superiority against other existing alternatives is demonstrated.	binomial options pricing model;carrier frequency;emoticon;fairness measure;frequency divider;holism;mathematical optimization;modelling of general systems;multi-user;network topology;next-generation network;numerical analysis;optimization problem;performance evaluation;simulation;subcarrier;telecommunications link;throughput	Eirini-Eleni Tsiropoulou;Aggelos Kapoukakis;Symeon Papavassiliou	2013	2013 IFIP Networking Conference		economics;telecommunications;operations management;computer network	Mobile	32.78843115658177	92.0574568626163	126148

It has been well recognized that the selection of relay nodes plays a critical role in the performance of multiple source-destination pairs. Unfortunately, all prior work has made an unrealistic assumption that each source-destination pair communicates over a dedicated channel with no mutual interference. In this paper, we study the problem of capacity maximization using cooperative communication in a cognitive radio network by jointly considering the relay assignment and channel allocation under a finite set of available channels, where the interference must be considered. It is proved to be NP-hard and a heuristic algorithm is proposed. Moreover, we exploit the network coding opportunities existing in CC that can further increase the capacity. Extensive simulations are conducted to show that the proposed algorithms can achieve high total capacity under various network settings.	channel capacity;cognitive radio;entropy maximization;expectation–maximization algorithm;heuristic (computer science);interference (communication);linear network coding;np-hardness;relay;simulation	Peng Li;Song Guo;Weihua Zhuang;Baoliu Ye	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2012.6364528	cognitive radio;spatial correlation;linear network coding;channel code;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;cooperative diversity;relay channel;channel capacity;statistics;computer network;mimo	Mobile	34.09630802090063	90.8495538703187	126167

Recently, PT has been applied as a spectrum management tool for cognitive radio for QoS management in CR and the pricing of CR access rights. PT is characterized by the analysis of risk and return, concepts that feature widely in wireless communications due to the random nature of traffic and radio channels. Compared with traditional CR resource management techniques (e.g., game theory), where the aim has been the maximization of QoS or another utility measure, the key advantage of PTbased resource management stems from the focus on both the mean utility achieved by a communication system, as well as utility variance. Ignoring QoS (e.g., throughput) variance in communication system design may lead to systems that are unusable by some applications, even though mean QoS remains high. In applications such as pricing-based spectrum management, PT analysis incorporates the variance of investment returns, a key measure of economic welfare, into pricing and trading strategies. In this article we examine the key concepts behind PT, risk and return, as well as their importance in CR and wireless communications. As examples, we analyze the application of PT in solving CR spectrum management problems through QoS management and pricing of spectrum access rights.	cognitive radio;communications satellite;expectation–maximization algorithm;game mechanics;game theory;global communications conference;image organizer;information engineering;institute of electronics, information and communication engineers;mathematical optimization;modern portfolio theory;quality of service;radio resource management;risk aversion;routing;systems design;throughput;traders;usability	Tadeusz A.

We are particularly interested in the case that CRs’ quantity is more than the available channels’, where traditional approaches will have high probabilities of collision. We first introduce a system model and an adaptive sensing threshold for available channels which is estimated according to the sensing probability of the specific sequential order. Then, we propose a channel sensing and access strategy that can adjust its sensing and access probabilities based on the crowded degree of sequential order. Last, we conduct extensive simulations to compare the performance of our approach with other typical ones.

Assuming that non-linear serial interference cancellation is performed at the receiver, the problem of noncooperative SINR maximization with respect to each user's spreading code and uplink receiver is first considered. It is shown that iterative SINR maximization converges in a finite number of steps, and that the equilibrium resulting from noncooperative behavior is also Pareto-optimal. Next, the problem of optimal multiuser detection for a system using the above optimal spreading codes is also considered, and it is shown that, for such a system, maximum likelihood detection entails a computational complexity that is exponential in the ratio between the number of users and the system processing gain, thus providing huge savings with respect to the general case wherein the optimal receiver has a complexity exponential in the number of users. While initially considering a simple frequencyflat synchronous CDMA system, the obtained results are then extended to more general scenarios, such as asynchronous CDMA systems, multipath CDMA channels, and multiuser multiantenna systems. Finally, the issue of non-cooperative power minimization and choice of the spreading code subject to a QoS constraints is also considered, and comparisons with the corresponding cooperative solution are also discussed. Numerical results corroborate the validity of the theoretical analysis, and show that the use of non-linear interference cancellation coupled with waveform adaptation brings remarkable performance gains with respect to linear multiuser receivers.	code;computational complexity theory;expectation–maximization algorithm;interference (communication);iterative method;mimo;mathematical optimization;multi-user;multipath propagation;nonlinear system;numerical method;pareto efficiency;process gain;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;telecommunications link;time complexity;waveform	Stefano Buzzi;Daniela Saturnino	2010	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2010.02.080375	computer simulation;game theory;code division multiple access;electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;signal processing;statistics	Mobile	34.23442425708472	90.04944199041744	127024
993d997dbadd3631d4b3312d5a8002996a91a0b7	a uniform-forcing transceiver design for over-the-air function computation		The future Internet-of-Things network is expected to connect billions of sensors, which incurs high latency for data aggregation. To overcome this challenge, a new technique called over-the-air function computation was recently developed to enable fusion center to receive a desired function directly. It utilizes the superposition property of wireless channel to realize the uniform summation of the desired function. In order to compensate the non-uniform fading of different sensors, we propose a novel uniform-forcing transceiver design for over-the-air function computation. A corresponding min-max optimization problem is formulated to minimize the distortion of the computation which is measured by mean squared error. Due to the non-convexity of the problem, it is relaxed to semidefinite programming first. Then, the performance of the initial solution is improved through successive convex approximation. Simulation results show that the proposed design is able to achieve significant performance gain with low complexity.

The first algorithm aims at optimizing the codewords assignment to the constellation points of a hexagonal grid to minimize the average Hamming distance between adjacent codewords. This codeword assignment is critical for the bit error rate performance that is usually more relevant than symbol error rate in coded schemes. We describe an efficient dynamic programming algorithm to solve this assignment problem. Then, we study the construction of the hexagonal grid that exploits the inherent redundancy in the hexagonal grid where the available constellation points for a given peak power are usually more than the grid size. Finally, we describe computationally efficient procedures for hard and soft decoding of hexagonal constellations. The proposed algorithms are shown to provide significant improvement for the bit error rate performance for both coded and uncoded schemes.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;assignment problem;bit error rate;cell signaling;code word;computation;dynamic programming;hamming distance;integer programming;requirement;x.690	Srinath Hosur;Mohamed F.

Geographically co-located RANs mutually cooperate each other through the combined use of base transceiver station (BTS) level intranetwork cooperation and RAN level internetwork cooperation. By jointly applying the two types of cooperation, BTSs within individual RAN as well as BTSs of several RANs communicate and intelligently cooperate for dynamically minimizing the number of active BTSs and thus reduce energy utilization at the access network level. Extensive simulations are carried out for exploring the degree of energy savings and sleeping patterns of BTSs of each cooperating RANs as well as that of the combined network. Simulation results show that through the proposed joint cooperation, each cooperating RAN gains substantial economical benefits by significantly reducing its energy expenditure. Furthermore, comparison with the cases of intranetwork and internetwork cooperation acting alone reveals that by participating in the joint cooperation, each RAN can achieve much higher energy savings.	access network;algorithm;broadcast television systems inc.;internetworking;mobile phone;network packet;simulation;transceiver	Md.

Especially, hotzone cells overlaid on a macrocell to cover hotspot areas are expected to prevail in HetNets, thus cost-effectively enhancing cellular capacity via spatial reuse of spectrum resource and offloading macrocells. In order to fully achieve such benefits, users need to be properly distributed/assigned to the overlaid hotzone cells such that the radio resources therein are fully utilized. To this end, we propose a new architecture called Adaptive Range Control of Hotzone Cells for Heterogeneous Networks (ARCHoN) that jointly controls the radio resource allocations and ranges of OFDMA-based hotzone cells. The use of cell ranges for distributing users in ARCHoN is advantageous in that it can be implemented within a conventional cell-selection framework without modifying user devices or an air interface. In ARCHoN, each cell allocates users radio (frequency, time and power) resources in a non-cooperative manner, deriving a sequence of allocations monotonically decreasing the entire load. For range control, two algorithms are proposed: per-cell and universal, which have a tradeoff between performance and computational complexity. The solution yielded by the combination of these radio resource and range control algorithms is analytically proven to converge to a unique fixed point. Our in-depth evaluation has shown ARCHoN to significantly improve the service quality of users; in an example simulation scenario, ARCHoN is shown to improve the signal-to-interference and noise ratios (SINRs) of users, on average, by up to 3.5 dB in downlink and 18.8 dB in uplink, over the case of the conventional handover framework.	algorithm;computational complexity theory;converge;decibel;fixed point (mathematics);frequency band;interference (communication);radio frequency;simulation;telecommunications link	Ji-Hoon Yun;Kang G.

It not only provides a high energy efficiency, but also maintains reliable connections. With the emergence of 5G mobile technology, the presence of device-to-device (D2D) communications within the cellular network has stimulated research on radio resource sharing. In this paper, we consider an underlay D2D network operating in a Rayleigh fading channel and propose a power allocation method that assigns transmit power levels to D2D UEs (DUEs) and cellular UEs (CUEs) such that the joint connection probability of DUEs and CUEs is maximized. The approach is formulated as a optimization problem, and we prove that the problem is log concave. Hence, the optimum powers for active UEs can be found easily using modern computational methods. Both the theoretical and simulated results show that the joint connectivity probability is improved by one to two orders of magnitude by applying the optimization procedure compared to conventional LTE open loop power allocation. This dramatic improvement comes at the cost of an increase in UE average transmit power. Thus, the proposed technique is well suited to 5G public safety and disaster relief communication modes where enhanced connectivity is the top priority.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);compaq lte;computation;concave function;emergence;mathematical optimization;multitier architecture;optimization problem;rayleigh fading;simulation;ues (cipher)	Jinchuan Tang;Justin P.

In this paper, we propose a Minimum Knapsack-based Interference-aware Resource Allocation (MIKIRA) approach to show that a channel sharing approach can be used to increase system sum rate, minimize the interference both at the evolved Node B (eNB) and the receiver of the D2D pairs, and most importantly achieve a good signal quality at the eNB in lower time complexity in an LTE cellular network. We compare the system sum rate, interference and Signal-to-Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) obtained by MIKIRA with a bipartite graph-based approach (GRA) for resource allocation and a random allocation approach. ¿From the results we find that MIKIRA shows improved performance when compared to other approaches in all of the metrics we used in the simulation. MIKIRA is more efficient in terms of time complexity (O(n2 log(n))) when compared with the GRA (O(n3)); and also results in higher quality signals as the SINR achieved at the eNB is much better than the other two approaches.	algorithm;compaq lte;interference (communication);scheduling (computing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;time complexity	Mohammad Tauhidul Islam;Abd-Elhamid M.

86065b69f91874532f3189af8085f67643ea7606	cooperative estimation of primary traffic under imperfect spectrum sensing and byzantine attacks		Cognitive radio (CR) systems exploit the accurate knowledge of primary traffic statistics to improve the CR performance and reduce the harmful interference on primary network. It is essential for cooperative CRs to operate in an efficient secured manner while estimating the primary statistics. In this paper, a new reporting mechanism for cooperative estimation of primary traffic is proposed to increase the spectrum and energy efficiency. This is achieved by the reduction of the reporting channel overhead from cooperative users to the fusion center. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme reduces significantly the signaling overhead, thus making the system more spectrum and energy efficient. Moreover, the openness of cooperative CR makes it susceptible to data falsification attacks, also known as Byzantine attacks. This attack poses a series of damages on the reliability of the estimation of primary traffic. In this paper, we define the types of malicious coordinated attacks on CRs and analyze the possibility of estimating the primary traffic statistics under these attacks. Moreover, we provide a simple yet effective countermeasure based on the proposed reporting for cooperative estimation. Simulation evaluation shows that the proposed algorithm provides an excellent countermeasure for spectrum sensing data falsification attacks.		A. S. M.

Our model explores the uncertainty of the jammer’s location by assuming the joint system knows only the a priori probabilities of jammer’s positions. The underlying problem is formulated and solved as a Bayesian game involving the joint radar/communication system and a jammer. We then explore how irrational behavior by the rivals can affect the equilibrium strategies by using prospect theory (PT). It is shown that the PT system strategy is not sensitive to the jammer’s probability weighting parameter, while jammer’s strategy is sensitive to probability weighted parameters of both rivals.	radar;theory	Andrey Garnaev;Wade Trappe;Athina P.

However, this mechanism requires users' voluntary contributions, which cannot be guaranteed since users are selfish and care only about their own performance. To stimulate user cooperation, in this work, we model the interaction among users in the wireless multicast system as a multi-buyer multi-seller price-based game, where users pay to receive relay service and get paid if they forward packets to others. It is a Stackelberg game, and backward induction is used to find the perfect Nash Equilibrium. We formulate the buyers' game as an evolutionary game and derive the evolutionarily stable strategy. Our simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed incentive mechanism.	backward induction;cooperative mimo;multicast;nash equilibrium;network packet;relay;simulation	Bo Hu;H.

The uplink performance region is studied here for such network employing orthogonal frequency-division multiple access. The authors characterise the limit of performance region using the Pareto boundary. This boundary describes all achievable performance results of beamformers and power allocation. Enabling BS allocation increases the spatial degree of freedom by cooperative reception but greatly complicates searching boundary of performance region. To overcome the complexity challenge, a fast and customised iterative algorithm is developed to check if an arbitrary given performance target is feasible. Using the proposed feasibility checking, the authors can characterise the Pareto-optimal boundary of uplink performance with activated BS allocation. The authors further study two types of BS allocation schemes, namely the network-centric and user-centric strategies. Comparison of both strategies is illustrated in the authors’ numerical examples.	algorithm;iterative method;pareto efficiency;telecommunications link	Li Lu;Desheng Wang;Yingzhuang Liu	2017	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2016.0767	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics	AI	30.525397268617887	91.13300200441905	129174

In the current work, a novel decentralized algorithm for Load Balancing in the downlink is suggested. Two are the major novelties in the analysis. (A) The algorithm is based on the solution of a mixed integer optimization problem solved using Lagrangian but not Linear Programming relaxation, which allows the solution to be binary for the user assignment variables. (B) Its implementation is based on exchange of certain prices among base stations and allows each of them to make choices individually without the aid of a central controller. The cell handover parameters are further adequately adjusted to enforce cell-edge users to migrate to their optimal base station. The algorithm aims at optimally balancing the load, while at the same time guaranteeing low levels of ICI. Its performance is evaluated through simulations, which illustrate the improvements provided on aggregate system utility.	aggregate data;algorithm;cell (microprocessor);compaq lte;ici (programming language);interference (communication);linear programming relaxation;load balancing (computing);mathematical optimization;optimization problem;simulation;telecommunications link;unbalanced circuit	Anastasios Giovanidis;Qi Liao;Slawomir Stanczak	2012	2012 International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas (WSA)	10.1109/WSA.2012.6181222	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;load balancing;computer network	Mobile	31.349365049545188	92.33443038941657	129177

Since each source and destination user uploads/downloads data when McRs are located in transmission range, we obtain more significant sum-throughput gain than fixed/no relay networks even if some packet delay might be burden for delay-sensitive cases. In this paper, we propose a couple of iterative algorithms: 1) water-filling power control (WFPC) for distance-based McR systems, 2) automatic initializing gradient algorithms (AIGA) that try to solve two optimization problems: 2-1) Sum-rate maximization, 2-2) Sum-MSE minimization. From the experimental results, utilizing McRs has much better sum-throughput performance than that of fixed/no relay cases, and WFBC also has the advantage in low SNR region. In addition, convergence points of general gradient methods highly depend on the step-size value, our proposed AIGA achieves lower complexity even if step-size is quite small.	algorithm;entropy maximization;gradient;iterative method;mathematical optimization;network packet;one-way function;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;throughput;upload	Byoung-Yoon Min;MinKeun Jeong;Dong Ku Kim;Kaibin Huang;Marios Kountouris	2013	2013 IEEE China Summit and International Conference on Signal and Information Processing	10.1109/ChinaSIP.2013.6625348	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science	Robotics	37.87590012718589	91.61211247812318	129181

This subject is addressed from the standpoint of different interrelated resource allocation mechanisms operating in multi-cell scenarios in order to exploit frequency and multi-user diversity: ICI coordination-avoidance and adaptive subcarrier and power allocation. Even though these methods can be applied in a stand-alone way, a significant performance improvement is achieved if they are jointly designed and operate in a combined basis. Several alternatives for mixed frequency and power ICI coordination schemes are proposed in this paper. Connected with a proper power mask-based design, the potential gain of a flexible frequency sectorization solution, halfway between fractional-soft frequency reuse and pure frequency sectorization, is explored. The main objective is to outperform fractional-soft frequency reuse offering an attractive trade-off between cell-edge user data rates and average cell throughput.

One of the most promising solutions is CoMP (Coordinated MultiPoint), which allows the involvement of multiple eNB in the transmission and reception process with a marked increase in throughput for users at the edge of cells. While downlink CoMP has been the focus of many works in the literature, in this paper we examine Uplink CoMP with Coordinated Scheduling in Heterogeneous Networks running LTE-A. We investigate its system-level performance through simulation in various realistic scenarios with frequency-selective Rayleigh fading. Specifically, we are interested in comparing the performance of Uplink CoMP with different cell types as well as different user participation to CoMP transmissions. Our simulation results confirm that edge users benefit from Uplink CoMP, although the overall throughput decreases. In order to mitigate the latter effect, we introduce two new parameters, called CoMP margin and CoMP Pool Percentage (CPP), and provide guidelines for their effective use.	compaq lte;consistent pricing process;pool (computer science);rayleigh fading;scheduling (computing);simulation;telecommunications link;throughput	Mohamad Tavakoli Sanij;Claudio Casetti	2016	2016 13th IEEE Annual Consumer Communications & Networking Conference (CCNC)	10.1109/CCNC.2016.7444754	telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	28.688473385594488	89.24644289890942	129854
07f0f255a2ed6a1533e85476d5efe1fb41bf2d0c	joint subcarrier assignment and power allocation in downlink scma systems		Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) represents a paradigm shift from conventional multiple access concept and is considered as a promising candidate multiple access technique for the fifth generation (5G) wireless communication systems. In this paper, we investigates the downlink resource allocation problem in SCMA systems. Taking user fairness into account, we formulate a problem to maximize the sum of logarithmic user data rate by jointly optimizing the subcarrier assignment and power allocation. The formulated problem is combinatorial and non-convex. To tackle this problem, we first convert the power allocation problem into a standard convex problem by assuming the subcarrier assignment is fixed. Based on this, then the algorithm ``remove and reallocate'' for joint power allocation and subcarrier assignment is proposed with low complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposal is near-optimal and can achieve good performance over both traditional OFDM systems and random subcarrier assignment in SCMA systems.	algorithm;convex function;convex optimization;data rate units;fairness measure;fifth generation computer;neural coding;programming paradigm;proportionally fair;simulation;sparse;subcarrier;telecommunications link;throughput	Wenfeng Zhu;Zheng Chen	2017	2017 IEEE 86th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2017.8288075	resource management;computer network;subcarrier;computer science;telecommunications link;wireless;convex optimization;distributed computing;resource allocation;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing	EDA	33.04066223357033	90.99199140666272	130389

In such a network, where licensed/primary users (who has the right to use the spectrum) and the unlicensed/secondary users coexist, a secondary spectrum market can be established where the primary network service provider charges the secondary users for the usage of the spectrum, while the secondary users also compete with each other for the access. Several important questions arise regarding the operation of such spectrum market: 1) how the spectrum should be priced; 2) how the secondary users should distributedly access the spectrum based on the spectrum price. To answer these questions, we interpret the available spectrum in the network as the aggregated interference tolerable at the receivers of the primary users, and introduce the notion of a market equilibrium in which the prices of the spectrum/interference are set correctly such that 1) the supply of the spectrum equals the demand of the spectrum, and 2) the secondary network is stable. We also developed an algorithm to distributedly compute such market equilibrium, and proved its convergence.	algorithm;coexist (image);cognitive radio;interference (communication);monopoly;network service provider;new source performance standard;purchasing	Mingyi Hong;Alfredo García	2010	8th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks		spectrum management;cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;computer network	ECom	31.55106509675785	95.57092545137102	130744

This predicates a need for offloading computationally intense parts of the applications to a resource strong cloud. Parallely, in the wireless networking world, the trend has shifted to multi-radio (as opposed to multi-channel) enabled communications. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive computation offloading solution that uses the multiple radio links available for associated data transfer, optimally. Our contributions include: a comprehensive model for the energy consumption from the perspective of the mobile device; the formulation of the joint optimization problem to minimize the energy consumed as well as allocating the associated data transfer optimally through the available radio links and an iterative algorithm that converges to a locally optimal solution. Simulations on an HTC phone, running a 14-component application and using the Amazon EC2 as the cloud, show that the solution obtained through the iterative algorithm consumes only 3% more energy than the optimal solution (obtained via exhaustive search).	algorithm;amazon elastic compute cloud (ec2);brute-force search;cloud computing;computation offloading;computer simulation;iterative method;local optimum;mathematical optimization;mobile device;optimization problem	S.

82070abfa974b90a6672d390cfbc6f85dd2026b5	scalable video multicast for multi-cell cellular wireless networks		—We consider adaptive-rate multicasting of video streams compressed by using Scalable Video Coding (SVC) over cellular wireless networks. Base station nodes coordinate the scheduling of their downlink transmissions to mitigate intercell interference; as well as, at times, to direct the multicast transmission of the same video streams to a group of clients, as implemented in a Multicast-Broadcast Single-Frequency Network (MBSFN) of LTE system operation. To enhance performance, we study the optimal configuration of a Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR) scheme. We classify cell users into two groups, based on their experienced SINR (signal-tointerference-plus-noise ratio) levels. Lower-SINR group users will be offered streams at a lower video quality level, while higher-SINR group members will be provided streams at a higher video quality level. For this purpose, through the proper joint setting of the channel encoding rate, video encoding rate and the scheduling schemes, we calculate the minimum bandwidth required per stream. We demonstrate the optimal design of such a system by considering a utility function that includes a metric expressing the user's willing-to-pay when the reception is of a sufficient high video-quality. We show that, under high cell coverage requirement, the proposed optimally configured FFR scheduling schemes offer a significantly enhanced performance behavior. We also show that such an MBSFN scheme that involves coordinated cooperation among 3 cells, combined with the optimal FFR scheme, outperforms a system that employs a regular MBSFN operation that involves cooperative transmissions among 7 and 19 cells.	compaq lte;data compression;interference (communication);multicast-broadcast single-frequency network;optimal design;scalable video coding;scalable video multicast;scheduling (computing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;streaming media;telecommunications link;utility	Hung-Bin Chang;Izhak Rubin;Ofer Hadar	2015	JCM	10.12720/jcm.10.9.715-727	multicast;ip multicast;inter-domain;reliable multicast;protocol independent multicast;pragmatic general multicast;internet group management protocol;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;xcast;computer network;multicast address	Mobile	27.106543253245462	94.73338396446997	130908

In general, SU transmitters need to adjust their transmission powers to maintain these constraints at all times. In this paper, we are interested in maximizing the number of concurrent SU flows under new PU arrivals and performing power allocation for SU links belonging to maintained data flows to maximize the minimum flow capacity. In particular, we develop a flow maintenance and power control scheme to solve this problem, which is referred to as Flow-Based Power Control (FBPC). The proposed scheme comprises two phases where we attempt to find a best set of flows with maximum size in the first phase and maximize the minimum flow capacity through power control in the second phase. To reduce computation complexity required in the first phase, we develop a flow combination metric, which is used to find the best flow combination. Moreover, we formulate power allocation problem that maximizes the minimum flow capacity and show how to transform it into a geometric convex program. Numerical results are presented to show the efficiency of the proposed flow combination metric and the desirable performance of the proposed two-phase flow maintenance and power control scheme.	blocking (computing);cognitive radio;computation;convex optimization;geometric programming;hoc (programming language);ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);metrics (networking);numerical method;quality of service;routing;superuser;transmitter;two-phase locking	Ba-Lam To;Thi Mai Trang Nguyen;Guy Pujolle	2012	2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314190	maintenance engineering;cognitive radio;real-time computing;flow network;geometric programming;minimum-cost flow problem;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	35.13256798530726	93.37865254944313	131448

We propose a method which diagonalizes the MSE matrix using singular value decomposition (SVD) and generalized SVD techniques. The proposed approach based on this diagonalized MSE matrix is suboptimal and aims to reduce the design complexity of the precoders. The solution can be obtained via an iterative water- filling technique.

The wide frequency spectrum of interest is segmented into frequency sub-bands due to software and hardware limitations. These sub-bands can be non-contiguous, and each may contain an arbitrary number of channels from an arbitrary number of systems. It is assumed that the CR can only sense one sub-band at a time. Three sub-band selection policies are proposed to find spectrum opportunities taking into account realistic hardware reconfiguration energy consumptions and time delays. Two of the proposed policies rely on the individual channel Markov properties and the sub-band Markov properties, respectively. Although these two policies may achieve good performance, they rely on complete knowledge of RF environment dynamics and thus may become computationally demanding. The third sub-band selection policy based on Q-learning is proposed to circumvent this. Performance of the three policies are compared and discussed against a performance upper-bound of the optimal solution to the corresponding partially observable Markov decision process formulation. The suitability of the Q-learning technique is validated by showing that it achieves good performance through numerical results in both simulated and real measured RF environments.	algorithm;cognitive radio;frequency band;markov chain;markov model;markov property;numerical analysis;partially observable markov decision process;partially observable system;q-learning;radio frequency;scheduling (computing);simulation;spectral density	Yang Li;Sudharman K.

This paper presents a novel solution that seamlessly integrates two technologies, mobile cloud computing and microwave power transfer (MPT), to enable computation in passive low-complexity devices such as sensors and wearable computing devices. Specifically, considering a single-user system, a base station (BS) either transfers power to or offloads computation from a mobile to the cloud; the mobile uses harvested energy to compute given data either locally or by offloading. A framework for energy efficient computing is proposed that comprises a set of policies for controlling CPU cycles for the mode of local computing, time division between MPT and offloading for the other mode of offloading, and mode selection. Given the CPU-cycle statistics information and channel state information (CSI), the policies aim at maximizing the probability of successfully computing given data, called computing probability, under the energy harvesting and deadline constraints. The policy optimization is translated into the equivalent problems of minimizing the mobile energy consumption for local computing and maximizing the mobile energy savings for offloading which are solved using convex optimization theory. The structures of the resultant policies are characterized in closed form. Furthermore, given non-causal CSI, the said analytical framework is further developed to support computation load allocation over multiple channel realizations, which further increases the computing probability. Last, simulation demonstrates the feasibility of wirelessly powered mobile cloud computing and the gain of its optimal control.	causal filter;central processing unit;channel state information;computation;convex optimization;instruction cycle;mathematical optimization;microwave;mobile cloud computing;mobile device;modern portfolio theory;multi-user;optimal control;resultant;sensor;simulation;wearable computer	Changsheng You;Kaibin Huang;Hyukjin Chae	2016	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2016.2545382	embedded system;real-time computing;mobile telephony;cloud computing;computer science;operating system;utility computing;mobile computing;computational model;energy harvesting;wireless	Mobile	30.72895143598738	90.96361353181844	132044

Optimality conditions for the FP problem are first introduced with the generalized convex function. Then, we derive the analytical solutions for the antennas both with and without transmitting at full power. Finally, the general solution and the entire algorithm are obtained.

However, the proposed algorithm is autonomous in the sense that it does not require the central unit to perform any state-machine process. Moreover, compared to other schemes it requires less information to be broadcast from the links.	algorithm;autonomous robot;finite-state machine;interference (communication)	Pouriya Sadeghi;M.

Thus, a novel cognitive radio resource management (RRM) is proposed to improve the spectrum utilization efficiency. An optimization framework for RRM is developed that makes the following contributions: (i) considering heterogeneous primary users (PUs) with multiple features stored in a radio environment map database, (ii) allowing variable CR demands, (iii) assuring interference protection towards PUs. After showing that the optimal solution is computationally infeasible, a suboptimal solution is consequently proposed. Performance evaluation is conducted in terms of total achieved data rate and satisfaction of CR requirements.	algorithm;cognitive radio;computational complexity theory;data rate units;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;performance evaluation;radio resource management;reflection mapping;requirement	Anna Vizziello;Ian F.

However, the spatial aspect is not yet well understood for the purpose of designing efficient spectrum sharing mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a framework of spatial spectrum access games on directed interference graphs, which can model quite general interference relationship with spatial reuse in wireless networks. We show that a pure Nash equilibrium exists for the two classes of games: (1) any spatial spectrum access games on directed acyclic graphs, and (2) any games satisfying the congestion property on directed trees and directed forests. Under mild technical conditions, the spatial spectrum access games with random backoff and Aloha channel contention mechanisms on undirected graphs also have a pure Nash equilibrium. We also quantify the price of anarchy of the spatial spectrum access game. We then propose a distributed learning algorithm, which only utilizes users' local observations to adaptively adjust the spectrum access strategies. We show that the distributed learning algorithm can converge to an approximate mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium for any spatial spectrum access games. Numerical results demonstrate that the distributed learning algorithm achieves up to 100 percent performance improvement over a random access algorithm.	anarchy;approximation algorithm;backoff;converge;directed acyclic graph;graph (discrete mathematics);interference (communication);nash equilibrium;network congestion;numerical method;random access	Xu Chen;Jianwei Huang	2015	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2014.2326673	games;game theory;throughput;simulation;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;interference;vegetation;nash equilibrium;wireless;computer network	Mobile	30.96929881766442	96.98318928802597	132881

While previous studies have mainly focused on theoretical gains and algorithms, this paper goes a step further, by assessing IA incorporated to a Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP)-like network. IA algorithms have been well studied in terms of transmissions performance and signaling cost, albeit for fixed number of users. In the current paper we evaluate the IA technique in more realistic scenarios, in which a scheduling policy is required towards providing service for a whole population of users while the sheer number of involved channels change all the time. The IA performance is shown to be in between the joint processing and conventional transmission schemes, which are distinguished by the coordination (or the lack of it) among the transmitters. By analyzing the impact of different scheduling policies based on distances between subspaces, it is concluded that the channel gains should not be disregarded by the schedulers when trying to improve system capacity.	algorithm;align (company);bus (computing);catastrophic interference;channel capacity;interference (communication);sara (computer);scheduling (computing);transmitter	Paulo G.

Based on Lagrangian duality, we reformulate the original problem into a dual uplink problem, which is expected to achieve the same optimal signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) as the primal downlink problem. The normalized dual uplink beamformer is the dominant eigenvector of a generalized eigenvalue decomposition (GEVD) problem, and the dual uplink transmit power can be solved iteratively. According to the duality theory, we develop an iterative algorithm and compare it with the beamformer-power iterative algorithm extended from [1].

9655a0b2b30fad4021451a9f14eaad4be7773abc	sdn-based efficient bandwidth allocation for caching enabled cognitive radio networks	routing protocols;resource management;interference;cognitive radio;bandwidth	In a cognitive radio network (CRN), allocating spectrum resources to terminals is a fundamental problem due to dynamic characteristics of wireless spectrum. However, distributed spectrum allocation schemes are usually sub-optimal due to lack of global information, and existing centralized schemes merely assume the existence of global information collection method without implementing the protocol. In this paper, we propose to use SDN framework for bandwidth allocation and global information collection. Our system, called software defined multi-hop cognitive radio network (SDM-CRN), has a centralized controller executing high level strategies of resource allocation by communicating with the terminals via the OpenFlow protocol. In SDM-CRN, all routers have caching capabilities so that a user request may be satisfied by local routers. Consequently, the traffic in CRNs may be unicast, muticast, converge-cast or hybrid. To satisfy these traffic demands, SDM-CRN jointly optimizes the selection of radio interfaces, channels, and power levels. We conjecture that this problem is NP-hard, and propose a heuristic algorithm. This algorithm constructs a 4-dimensional conflict graph (4-DCG), generates a set of maximal independent sets, and allocates spectrum to terminals by linear programming.

However, unique features of M2M communications, such as the larger number of connected devices and the diversity of applications, require specific enhancements to these cellular systems. Because of the nature of most of M2M applications, a large number of uplink transmissions is expected, rendering uplink scheduling as an essential issue towards supporting M2M communications via cellular networks. We propose two scheduling schemes for the uplink of LTE-based cellular systems, which take into account both the channel conditions and the maximum allowed delay of each device requesting to be served. In contrast to other scheduling algorithms no classes of devices are formed, but the exact delay constraint of each device is considered, approaching the requirements of M2M communications in a more realistic way. This way, the number of effectively served requests increases, while it becomes possible to exploit the exact delay constraints in order to put the devices in sleep modes, until next transmissions. It is also shown that dividing the devices into a limited number of QoS classes deteriorates the system's performance.	algorithm;compaq lte;internetworking;machine to machine;quality of service;requirement;scheduling (computing);sleep mode;telecommunications link	Athanasios S.

A unified system model is formulated relying on the dynamic state-space approach, by taking two coupling hidden states into accounts. A random finite set (RFS) inspired Bayesian algorithm is suggested to estimate unknown PU states recursively accompanying its time-varying locations. To avoid the mis-tracking aroused by the intermittent disappearance of PU, an adaptive horizon expanding (AHE) mechanism is designed.

Since the existing works based on the centralized manner require the heavy feedback overhead between a base station (BS) and relay stations (RSs), we design a resource allocation scheme in the semi-distributed manner to reduce the feedback overhead. In the proposed scheme, a frame is divided into subframes and the BS and RSs allocate the subchannel in the dedicated subframe to its associated mobile stations (MSs). In addition, the proposed scheme guarantees fairness among MSs with the throughput-optimal scheduling. Through the simulation, we show that the proposed scheme is effective to guarantee fairness among MSs while it achieves the higher average throughput than the existing opportunistic schemes.	algorithm;broadcast relay station;centralized computing;digital subchannel;fairness measure;iterative method;numerical analysis;overhead (computing);scheduling (computing);semiconductor industry;simulation;throughput	Chung-Woon Park;Ho-Jin Lee;Jong-Tae Lim	2012	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2012.052512.120291	fairness measure;database index;throughput;real-time computing;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;resource management;computer network	Mobile	31.626638578031283	89.53872263503278	133675

The mechanism adopts HJ algorithm to local search to prevent falling into the local optimum, and proposes a discrete QPSO algorithm to match the discrete spectrum assignment model. The mechanism has the advantages of approximating optimal solution, rapid convergence, less parameters, avoiding falling into local optimum. Compared with existing spectrum assignment algorithms, the simulation results show that according to different optimization objectives, the HJ-DQPSO optimization mechanism for multi-objective optimization can better approximate optimal solution and converge fast. We can obtain a reasonable spectrum allocation scheme in the case of satisfying multiple optimization objectives.	access network;approximation algorithm;cognitive radio;combinatorial optimization;converge;fairness measure;frequency allocation;heterojunction;hooke's atom;local optimum;local search (optimization);mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;network model;optimization mechanism;optimization problem;particle swarm optimization;quantum;simulation	Zhu Jiang;Xiong Jiahao;Chen Hongcui;Han Chao	2015	EAI Endorsed Trans.

However, a conventional D2D link is controlled by an eNB, and it still remains burdens to the eNB. We propose a completely distributed power allocation method for D2D communication underlaying LTE using deep learning. In the proposed scheme, a D2D transmitter can decide the transmit power without any help from other nodes, such as an eNB or another D2D device. Also, the power set, which is delivered from each D2D node independently, can optimize the overall cell throughput. We suggest a distirbuted deep learning architecture in which the devices are trained as a group, but operate independently. The deep learning can optimize total cell throughput while keeping constraints such as interference to eNB. The proposed scheme, which is implemented model using Tensorflow, can provide same throughput with the conventional method even it operates completely on distributed manner.	centralized computing;compaq lte;deep learning;distributed computing;global optimization;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;tensorflow;throughput;transmitter	Jeehyeong Kim;Joohan Park;Jaewon Noh;Sunghyun Cho	2018	CoRR		artificial neural network;throughput;transmitter power output;distributed power;architecture;transmitter;deep learning;computer network;artificial intelligence;computer science	Mobile	29.82282937633066	91.38491880635115	133958

The standard approach is to convert the problems into the form of semi-definite programming (SDP) with the aid of rank relaxation and later employ randomization techniques for solution search. However, in many cases, this approach brings solutions that are far from the optimal ones. We consider the problem of minimizing the total power transmitted by the antenna array subject to quality-of-service (QoS) at the secondary receivers and interference constraints at the primary receivers. It is shown that this problem, which is known to be nonconvex NP-hard, can be approximated by a convex second-order cone programming (SOCP) problem. Then, an iterative algorithm in which the SOCP approximation is successively improved is presented. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach in terms of total transmitted power and feasibility, together with a reduced computational complexity, as compared to the existing ones, for both the perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) cases. It is further shown that the proposed approach can be used to address the max-min fairness (MMF) based beamforming problem.	approximation algorithm;beamforming;best, worst and average case;channel state information;cognitive radio;computation;computational complexity theory;concave function;fairness measure;incremental funding methodology;interference (communication);iteration;iterative method;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;max-min fairness;maxima and minima;multicast;np-hardness;optimization problem;quadratic programming;quality of service;second-order cone programming;semiconductor industry;semidefinite programming;simulation	Marko Beko	2012	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2012.092712.120201	mathematical optimization;quality of service;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;iterative method;quadratic programming;semidefinite programming	Vision	37.65015958524278	90.16863624385044	134027

In this paper, an interference avoidance and resource allocation scheme based on PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) is proposed to maximize the system spectral efficiency by allowing more than one D2D pair to share the same frequency resource with one CUE. A mode selection scheme is also proposed after the mapping process of the PSO.

In this paper, we consider an underlay cognitive radio system where a large number of secondary users (SUs) can share the spectrum with a primary user (UP). We assume that M antennas are used at the cognitive base station (CBS) and the CBS does not have the full channel state information (CSI) from secondary users. We propose to study the problem of secondary users scheduling under the assumption of imperfect CSI of the interference channel between the CBS and the primary receiver. In order to minimize the interference to the UP, we propose to generate orthogonal beams to the estimate of the channel between the CBS and the PU. Then, to reduce the amount of required feedback, we propose a scheduling algorithm based on opportunistic beamforming. To further reduce the amount of feedback, a threshold is applied to the signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) feedback. For the proposed scheme, we develop a statistical analysis for the interference caused to the PU as well as the throughput of the secondary system.	algorithm;beamforming;channel state information;cognitive network;cognitive radio;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);one-class classification;scheduling (computing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;thresholding (image processing);throughput;transmitter;two-phase commit protocol	Ayman Massaoudi;Noura Sellami;Mohamed Siala	2013	2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666687	cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;operating system;antenna;co-channel interference;scheduling;precoding;computer network	Mobile	33.87654794983617	89.83476420725417	134155

To effectively deal with the dynamics of D2D based cellular networks, stochastic optimization problems are formulated, so as to optimize the long-term EE of both DUGs and CUTs under the constraints of queue stability, battery capacity and average transmission rate. With weighted sum method and Lyapunov optimization approach, we can sufficiently handle the non-convexity of the original problem by deriving an equivalent one. Through optimal solutions of the problems, each DUG and CUT can manage their power resources more efficiently, which improves their long-term EE performance individually.

The allocation mode is dynamically selected by a control unit (CU) depending on the changing interference pattern among individual FAPs. The FAPs are assumed to be mutually interfered if interference is higher than a specified threshold. In order to create interference matrix among the FAPs, we use Bron-Kerbosch algorithm. In case the FAPs are assessed to be interfered, the CU also allocates resources in the NAM mode in dynamic nature in dependence on current traffic load of the FAPs. The results indicate that the proposal offers significantly higher throughput for the macro users than other competitive schemes.

3d7cce6273d2d88736c57507b609ce8acd3b230a	qos-aware channel assignment for weighted sum-rate maximization in d2d communications		Underlaying device-to-device (D2D) communication links to a cellular network is a promising way to improve spectrum efficiency, for which the cross- link interference should be carefully controlled. Resource allocation has been widely utilized for managing interference in D2D networks. However, most previous works made simple assumptions by either ignoring the reliability requirement of D2D links or not allowing multiple D2D links to share the same channel. In this paper, we propose effective channel assignment algorithms to maximize the weighted sum-rate in a cellular network with underlaying D2D communications, where multiple D2D links are allowed to share the same channel. Meanwhile, the minimum Signal-to- Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) requirements for both cellular and D2D links are guaranteed. We first provide an optimal algorithm based on dynamic programming (DP) to serve as the performance benchmark, which enjoys much lower complexity compared to exhaustive search. To further reduce complexity, we then propose a cluster-based near-optimal channel assignment algorithm. Simulation results will demonstrate the advantage of allowing multiple D2D links to share the same channel in dense D2D networks, as well as verifying the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.	assignment problem;benchmark (computing);brute-force search;computer cluster;dynamic programming;expectation–maximization algorithm;interference (communication);quality of service;requirement;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;spectral efficiency;verification and validation;weight function	Rui Wang;Jun Zhang;Shenghui Song;Khaled Ben Letaief	2014	2015 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7417341	channel allocation schemes;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;resource management;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	30.32849461320048	91.98562010807927	135153

In this paper, we propose the optimal spectrum allocation strategy of cognitive radio NAN Gateway (NGW), which also acts as a spectrum collector by radio sensing and leasing from the providers for a fee. Since the service terminals in grid are heterogeneous based on different QoS requirements and willingness to pay, this paper uses differential pricing and admission control for different terminals to improve the benefits of NGW. The decision-making process for spectrum collection and allocation is modeled as a 4-stage Stackelberg gaming, where the optimal decision of radio sensing, spectrum leasing, admission control and differential pricing are deducted through a reverse derivation. A novel corresponding algorithm is also given to solve these optimal solutions efficiently. The numerical results verify the theoretical work sufficiently, meanwhile some obvious meaningful conclusions are drawn from the observation of numerical experiments.	algorithm;backward induction;cognitive radio;experiment;frequency allocation;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;requirement	Xueyao Zhao;Lei Feng;Xiao Cheng;Wenjing Li;Peng Yu;Xuesong Qiu;Lei Wei	2018	NOMS 2018 - 2018 IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium	10.1109/NOMS.2018.8406178	smart grid;quality of service;wireless sensor network;distributed computing;computer network;computer science;radio spectrum;admission control;cognitive radio;optimal decision;frequency allocation	Embedded	29.86515395949228	95.7739443817071	135535

058e35cd32f6e07d5fb560b1328880be73d6942e	optimal distributed channel assignment in d2d networks using learning in noisy potential games		We present a novel solution for Channel Assignment Problem (CAP) in Device-to-Device (D2D) wireless networks that takes into account the throughput estimation noise. CAP is known to be NP-hard in the literature and there is no practical optimal learning algorithm that takes into account the estimation noise. In this paper, we first formulate the CAP as a Stochastic Optimization Problem (SOP) to maximize the expected sum data rate. To capture the estimation noise, CAP is modeled as a noisy potential game, a novel notion we introduce in this paper. Then, we propose a distributed Binary Log-linear Learning Algorithm (BLLA) that converges to the optimal channel assignments. Convergence of BLLA is proved for bounded and unbounded noise. Proofs for fixed and decreasing temperature parameter of BLLA are provided. A sufficient number of estimation samples is given that guarantees the convergence to the optimal state. We assess the performance of BLLA by extensive simulations, which show that the sum data rate increases with the number of channels and users. Contrary to the better response algorithm, the proposed algorithm achieves the optimal channel assignments distributively even in presence of estimation noise.	algorithm;algorithmic learning theory;assignment problem;data rate units;log-linear model;optimization problem;simulation;stochastic optimization;throughput;transaction log;uncompressed video	Mohd.

c449ebcca7992e04844881ac17531d22f6d2bb62	joint dynamic switching point configuration and resource allocation in tdd-ofdma networks: optimal formulation and suboptimal solution		With the large increase in data services with asymmetric traffic loads, the time division duplexing TDD mode of operation of the next generation cellular wireless standards has gained an increasing interest from both cellular network operators and the research community. However, the introduction of TDD has raised several critical design requirements. Among others, the introduced flexibility in splitting resources between the uplink and downlink directions makes of the uplink/downlink switching point configuration a major design problem, especially that it is directly connected to other design aspects such as resource allocation and interference mitigation. In this paper, we formulate joint switching point configuration and resource allocation in TDD systems as an optimization problem with the objective of minimising the total interference under traffic load and other network constraints. The problem is then reformulated by linearizing some of the nonlinear terms. Because of the persistent difficulty of the problem, we propose a three-stage suboptimal algorithm. The algorithm clusters the cells in a given network into different groups depending on the susceptibility of cells to interfere on each other with emphasis on base station-base station and mobile station-mobile station interference. Switching point configuration using standardised long term evolution LTE frame structures and multicell resource allocation utilising uplink and downlink interference indicators are subsequently performed independently.

c617a99ccbfd00ff62ca556d7832729077c211a5	joint spatial relay distribution and resource allocation & icic strategies for performance enhancement for inband relay lte-a systems		Relaying is seen as a cost-effective solution to increase the coverage and improve the capacity for LTE-A networks. However, the resource allocation among different nodes and links and inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC) are important challenges in order to make the most of the potential benefits of relay deployments. This paper focuses on Type 1 half-duplex inband relaying. Several strategies related to radio resource partition and frequency reuse between nodes and links are proposed for various relay deployments. Modified FFR-based resource sharing schemes for ICIC are proposed for both access and backhaul subframes, jointly considering the impact of the number and location of relays on the sector. The real impact of the capacity of the backhaul link on system performance is explicitly taken into account. In addition, relay cell range expansion with several bias offsets is analyzed.	backhaul (telecommunications);catastrophic interference;compaq lte;duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);mathematical optimization;relay	Miguel Eguizabal;Ángela Hernández-Solana	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-10353-2_16	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	Mobile	26.78658404048107	88.60895265451227	136040

Both the uplink and the dual downlink are considered. Based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions associated with both problems, a relation between the two problems is discovered, which is termed the uplink-downlink duality in sum MSE under imperfect CSI. As a result, the MSMSEs in both links are the same and any admissible uplink design satisfying the KKT conditions can be translated for application to the downlink, and vice versa. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the duality and show the impact of imperfect CSI.	channel state information;karush–kuhn–tucker conditions;mimo-ofdm;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;multi-user mimo;regular expression;simulation;telecommunications link;transceiver;transmitter;tucker decomposition	Minhua Ding;Steven D.

043197abfa22e81e4c87c9f98eff302489d87963	a practical resource management scheme for cellular underlaid d2d networks		In this paper, we investigate a resource management scheme for cellular underlaid device-to-device (D2D) communications, which are an integral part of mobile caching networks. D2D communications are allowed to share radio resources with cellular communications as long as the generating interference of D2D communications satisfies an interference constraint to secure cellular communications. Contrary to most of the other studies, we propose a distributed resource management scheme for cellular underlaid D2D communications focusing on a practical feasibility. In the proposed scheme, the feedback of channel information is not required because all D2D transmitters use a fixed transmit power and every D2D transmitter determines when to transmit data on its own without centralized control. We analyze the average sum-rates to evaluate the proposed scheme and compare them with optimal values, which can be achieved when a central controller has the perfect entire channel information and the full control of all D2D communications. Our numerical results show that the average sum-rates of the proposed scheme approach the optimal values in low or high signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) regions. In particular, the proposed scheme achieves almost optimal average sum-rates in the entire SNR values in practical environments.	bitmap;cache (computing);centralized computing;computation;computational complexity theory;floor and ceiling functions;interference (communication);job scheduler;noise power;numerical analysis;overhead (computing);signal-to-noise ratio;telecommunications link;transmitter	Tae Won Ban	2017	Future Internet	10.3390/fi9040062	resource management;control theory;transmitter power output;computer network;computer science;transmitter;communication channel	Mobile	31.697485048824735	89.32342165824238	136218

In this work, we propose to jointly optimise energy efficiency (EE) and spectrum efficiency (SE) such that the network providers can dynamically tune the trade-off parameter for different design requirements. This paper formulates the EE-SE trade-off as a multi-objective optimisation problem (MOP) in the uplink of multi-user two-tier Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing Heterogeneous Networks. Using the weighted sum method, the MOP can be transformed into a single-objective optimisation problem (SOP). The proposed EE and SE trade-off optimisation problem is strictly quasi-concave. Hence, using Dual Decomposition approach, we derive the unique optimal solution. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and illustrate the fundamental tradeoff between EE and SE for different tradeoff parameters such as maximum transmission power and circuit power.	algorithm;cell (microprocessor);concave function;decstation;duality (optimization);lego digital designer;lagrangian relaxation;mathematical optimization;multi-user;multiplexing;multitier architecture;newton's method;numerical method;requirement;semantic network;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;weight function	Haris Pervaiz;Leila Musavian;Qiang Ni	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2015.7249184	telecommunications;resource allocation;small cell	Robotics	31.36369673090433	92.57330957188141	136377

Solving the arising scheduling problem by an exhaustive search is prohibitively complex due to its combinatorial nature so that the use of successive user allocation schemes has been proposed. We show that existing schemes lead to strongly suboptimal solutions in systems with a low number of degrees of freedom and that better performance can be achieved with a new scheduling criterion. By introducing additional correction steps, we end up with an efficient close-to-optimum algorithm.	algorithm;beamforming;brute-force search;quality of service;scheduling (computing);system analysis;zero-forcing precoding	Christoph Hellings;Michael Joham;Wolfgang Utschick	2010	2010 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference GLOBECOM 2010	10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683265	mathematical optimization;quality of service;computer science;resource management;mathematics;distributed computing	EDA	34.8098422034219	90.31206701488489	136476

602c8732da689dab8d1935a6b14427e567bef968	priority access and general authorized access interference mitigation in the spectrum access system		To meet the capacity needs of next generation wireless communications, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission has recently introduced the spectrum access system. Spectrum is shared between three tiers—incumbents, priority access licensees (PAL), and general authorized access (GAA) licensees. When the incumbents are absent, PAL and GAA share the spectrum under the constraint that GAA ensure the interference to PAL is no more than  $-$40 dBm with at least 99% confidence. We consider the scenario where locations are not shared between PAL and GAA. We propose a PAL–GAA cochannel interference mitigation technique that does not expose base station locations. Our approach relies on GAA sharing the distribution and maximum number of transmitters in a finite area. We show how PAL can derive the distribution of the aggregate interference using the probability density function and characteristic function, and notify GAA about the exclusion zones in space that will guarantee that the interference requirement is met. We also propose a numerical approximation using inverse fast Fourier and discrete Fourier transforms. Analytically calculated distribution aligns well with the numerical results. Additionally, we formulate an optimization problem for the optimal exclusion zone size. We analytically prove convexity of the problem. Our approach reduces the exclusion zone size by over 42%, which gives significantly more spectral opportunities to GAA in the spatial domain.	aggregate data;approximation;authorization;characteristic function (convex analysis);convex function;dbm;discrete fourier transform;fast fourier transform;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;next-generation network;numerical analysis;optimization problem;pal;transmitter	Ying He;Beeshanga Abewardana Jayawickrama;Eryk Dutkiewicz;Srikathyayani Srikanteswara;Markus Dominik Mueck	2018	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2018.2797970	probability density function;characteristic function (probability theory);fast fourier transform;computer network;cognitive radio;computer science;discrete fourier transform;base station;optimization problem;convexity	Metrics	28.119584874893473	89.72633632441877	137042

The original problem is indeed non-convex, and we prove the convexity of the problem after a series of convex transformation. An iterative approach is proposed to find the local optimal solution of the original problem for achieving the maximum EE. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the tradeoff between the EE and the SE.	cobham's thesis;convex function;convex optimization;interference (communication);iterative method;mathematical optimization;multi-user;noise power;optimization problem;quality of service;relay;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;spectral efficiency	Keshav Singh;Meng-Lin Ku;Jia-Chin Lin	2015	2015 IEEE 26th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2015.7343587	quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;antenna;computer network	Embedded	35.54768345437903	90.29320720658228	137487
ba65c1554891bf2209b3efc7ae189d9a4d535eaf	self-organizing flying drones with massive mimo networking		This article studies distributed algorithms to con-trol self-organizing swarm drone hotspots with massive MIMO networking capabilities — a network scenario referred to as OrgSwarm. We attempt to answer the following fundamental question: what is the optimal way to provide spectrally-efficient wireless access to a multitude of ground nodes with mobile base stations/aerial relays mounted on a swarm of drones and endowed with a large number of antennas; when we can control the position of many-antenna-enabled drones, access association of ground nodes to drones, and the transmit power of ground nodes? The article first derives a mathematical formulation of the problem of spectral efficiency maximization through joint control of the movement of many-antenna-enabled aerial drones, access association of single-antenna ground nodes to many-antenna drones, and transmit power of ground nodes. It is shown that the resulting network control problem is a mixed integer nonlinear nonconvex programming problem (MINLP). We then first design a distributed solution algorithm with polynomial computational complexity. Then, a centralized but globally optimal solution algorithm is designed based on a combination of the branch and bound framework and convex relaxation techniques to provide a performance benchmark for the distributed algorithm. Results indicate that the distributed algorithm achieves a network spectral efficiency very close (over 95% on average) to the global optimum.	aerial photography;benchmark (computing);branch and bound;centralized computing;computational complexity theory;distributed algorithm;entropy maximization;global optimization;hoc (programming language);linear programming relaxation;mimo;many antennas;maxima and minima;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;nonlinear system;organizing (structure);polynomial;relay;self-organization;simulation;spectral efficiency;swarm;television antenna;unmanned aerial vehicle	Zhangyu Guan;Nan Cen;Tommaso Melodia;Scott Pudlewski	2018	2018 17th Annual Mediterranean Ad Hoc Networking Workshop (Med-Hoc-Net)	10.23919/MedHocNet.2018.8407088	distributed computing;mimo;drone;swarm behaviour;distributed algorithm;branch and bound;spectral efficiency;computational complexity theory;base station;computer science	Mobile	30.78127379655024	93.11874272428415	137637
1d33626dc6ca87faf2401975f6272f467516ef96	downlink interference management in dense drone small cells networks using mean-field game theory		The use of drone small cells (DSCs) has recently drawn significant attentions as one key enabler for providing air-to-ground communication services in various situations. This paper investigates the co-channel deployment of dense DSCs, which are mounted on captive unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). As the altitude of a DSC has a huge impact on the performance of downlink, the downlink interference control problem is mapped to an altitude control problem in this paper. All DSCs adjust their altitude to improve the available signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). The control problem is modeled as a mean-field game (MFG), where the cost function is designed to combine the available SINR with the cost of altitude controling. The interference introduced from a big amount of DSCs is derived through a mean-field approximation approach. Within the proposed MFG framework, the related Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equations are deduced to describe and explain the control policy. The optimal altitude control policy is obtained by solving the partial differential equations with a proposed finite difference algorithm based on the upwind scheme. The simulations illustrate the optimal power controls and corresponding mean field distribution of DSCs. The numerical results also validate that the proposed control policy achieves better SINR performence of DSCs compared to the uniform control scheme.

Unlike previouscontributions, we consider a circular message exchange. First, an outer bound and achievable sum rateexpressions for different relaying protocols are derived for 3-way relay channels. The sum capacity ischaracterized for certain SNR regimes. Next, leveraging the derived achievable sum rate expressions,cooperative and competitive maximization of the energy efciency are considered. For the cooperativecase, both low-complexity and globally optimal algorithms for joint power allocation at the users and atthe relay are designed so as to maximize the system global energy efciency. For the competitive case, agame theoretic approach is taken, and it is shown that the best response dynamics is guaranteed to convergeto a Nash equilibrium. A power consumption model for mmWave board-to-board communications isdeveloped, and numerical results are provided to corroborate and provide insight on the theoreticalndings.Index TermsMulti-way networks, relay systems, energy efcienc y, green communications, resource allocation,fractional programming, monotonic optimization, game theory, 5G networks, mmWave communications,power control.	relay;throughput	Bho Matthiesen;Alessio Zappone;Eduard Axel Jorswieck	2014	CoRR		game theory;throughput;mathematical optimization;power control;best response;relay;fractional programming;nash equilibrium;computer science;resource allocation	OS	35.03285566615884	89.02942732457176	137881

Two possible subcarrier allocation methods are considered for soft hand-over. One method is to use an identical subcarrier set between the two cells participating in the hand-over. The other is to use different subcarrier sets between the two cells. As expected, the different subcarrier strategy is better in terms of diversity order and BER than the identical subcarrier strategy. It will be shown that the BER performance difference between the two strategies is more noticeable with contiguous subcarrier allocation. But the different subcarrier strategy consumes twice more frequency resources than the other, and there is a trade-off between the two strategies in terms of BER and frequency resources. By considering the trade-off, we also propose a subcarrier allocation strategy for soft hand-over.	subcarrier	Chanhong Kim;Jungwoo Lee	2012	TIIS	10.3837/tiis.2012.03.001	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science	ECom	29.112663429029247	89.4247103253846	138177

Since there is a large disparity between the transmit power levels of the macro and small cell base stations, the traditional downlink received signal strength indicator (RSSI) based user association results in extreme load imbalance and high uplink interference, which degrades the spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency, especially in uplink. Focusing on this, we propose energy efficiency-aware user association taking into account both uplink and downlink. However, the formulated non-convex and combinatorial problem cannot be distributively solved by convex optimization techniques or common game-theoretic methods. Thus, we apply the matching theory to develop a distributed user association algorithm, which reaches a stable matching upon convergence. Lastly, by comparing with two downlink-centric user association methods, the proposed algorithm is shown to have a superior performance in terms of energy efficiency, uplink capacity and energy saving.	algorithm;binocular disparity;convex optimization;game theory;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimization problem;semantic network;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;spectral efficiency;stable marriage problem;telecommunications link	Qiaoni Han;Bo Yang;Cailian Chen;Xin-Ping Guan	2016	2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752460	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering	Robotics	30.8142497371493	92.39940407154766	138263

Combining with millimeter wave (mmWave) and Sub-6GHz, we divide the optimization of system capacity into two Sub- optimization problems. Firstly, this paper proposes a resource allocation algorithm based on the maximum interference free group (MIFG) for the users in mmWave Pico BS (PBS). The capacity of each PBS is maximized by grouping users and maximizing the utilization of resource block (RB). Secondly, to ensure the service quality of users in Macro BS (MBS), a twostage QoS guaranteed greedy pair (TQGP) algorithm is proposed in this paper. Simulation results indicate that the proposed capacity efficient resource allocation strategy can improve the system capacity with user QoS guaranteed.	channel capacity;frequency band;greedy algorithm;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;multitier architecture;pico;quality of service;scheduling (computing);simulation	Xu Yang;Xiaohui Li;Wenjuan Pu;Danfeng Meng	2018	2018 IEEE 87th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2018.8417612	resource management;computer network;quality of service;computer science;heterogeneous network;resource allocation;optimization problem	Embedded	28.652300438927803	92.39688906152504	138441

To tackle these challenges, cloud-based cellular architectures have been proposed where virtual base stations (VBSs) play a key role. VBSs bring further energy savings but also demands a new energy consumption model as well as the optimization of computational resources. This paper studies the energy-delay tradeoffs of VBSs with delay tolerant traffic. We propose a computational-resource-aware energy consumption model to capture the total energy consumption of a VBS and reflect the dynamic allocation of computational resources including the number of CPU cores and the CPU speed. Based on the model, we analyze the energy-delay tradeoffs of a VBS considering BS sleeping and state switching cost to minimize the weighted sum of power consumption and average delay. We derive the explicit form of the optimal data transmission rate and find the condition under which the energy optimal rate exists and is unique. Opportunities to reduce the average delay and achieve energy savings simultaneously are observed. We further propose an efficient algorithm to jointly optimize the data rate and the number of CPU cores. Numerical results validate our theoretical analyses and under a typical simulation setting we find more than 60% energy savings can be achieved by VBSs compared with conventional base stations under the EARTH model, which demonstrates the great potential of VBSs in 5G cellular systems.	algorithm;central processing unit;cloud computing;computation;computational resource;data rate units;mathematical optimization;memory management;multi-core processor;next-generation network;simulation;uncompressed video;vbscript;weight function	Tao Zhao;Jian Wu;Sheng Zhou;Zhisheng Niu	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Communication Systems	10.1109/ICCS.2014.7024759	real-time computing;simulation;computer science;operating system;earth;computational model;computer network	Embedded	24.839937527133312	93.96173373954709	138489
df3b84aaa0c4450f6748dfc8f46e42ebba56bcc7	backhaul aware energy efficiency analysis of cache-enabled cellular networks (invited paper)		Caching at the edge has emerged as a promising technology to enhance the quality of service (QoS) of users and mitigate the backhaul load. Since the cache capacity is not arbitrarily large to store all contents, the backhaul can assist to fetch the contents from the core network. The network performance analysis of base station (BS) caching should consider the limited backhaul capacity. In this paper, we analyze the energy efficiency of the cache-enabled cellular networks considering the backhaul with stochastic geometry. First, the content coverage probability (CCP) based on the limited backhaul is analyzed. With the obtained CCP results, the expressions of throughput, power consumption and energy efficiency for a general case and a specific case with the mean load approximation are derived respectively. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of theoretical analysis and verify that BSs caching can dramatically improve energy efficiency on the condition that the content popularity is skewed and the backhaul capacity is relatively small.	approximation;backhaul (telecommunications);cache (computing);computer simulation;network performance;quality of service;throughput	Congshan Fan;Tiankui Zhang;Zhimin Zeng;Yue Chen	2018	2018 IEEE 87th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2018.8417654	computer science;quality of service;wireless sensor network;throughput;computer network;cache;backhaul (telecommunications);network performance;core network;cellular network	HPC	24.69059691874463	90.84904939252935	138592

Since femto APs can be deployed unpredictably in a macro cell area, interference to macro users and interference between femto APs in down-link (DL) cause a severe problem. In this paper, we describe the system model using a noncooperative game model. We formulate a payoff function to provide fairness and to minimize interference. At the same time, we prove that this function can be appeared as a supermodular type. Our power control algorithm based on the game model can be applied to the decentralized environment. This novel power control algorithm leads transmission power to reach a steady state condition, i.e. Nash Equilibrium (NE). Through mathematical analysis and numerical results, we show that our proposed power control algorithm has several good characteristics.	algorithm;fairness measure;game theory;interference (communication);nash equilibrium;numerical analysis;paywall;steady state;supermodular function;telecommunications link	Eun Jin Hong;Seyoung Yun;Dong-Ho Cho	2009	2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449782	nickel;database index;games;game theory;algorithm design;simulation;systems modeling;telecommunications;power control;computer science;mathematical model;distributed computing;interference;steady state;nash equilibrium	Mobile	31.537206753557957	94.57420769978111	138801

In this strategy, the interference temperature (IT) constraint is transformed to a performance index controlled by adjusting target signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR). And each active secondary user (SU) controls its transmission power related with its instantaneous SINR to track the target SINR and minimize the given performance index. Simulation results show that the two proposed power control strategies are effective and valid for the guarantee of SINR and IT requirements of both SUs and primary user (PU).	channel (communications);cognitive radio;computer simulation;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;optimal control;quantum fluctuation;requirement;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;state space;superuser	Shuying Zhang;Xiaohui Zhao	2017	2017 IEEE 86th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2017.8287970	electronic engineering;power control;linear-quadratic-gaussian control;linear-quadratic regulator;cognitive radio;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;computer science;regulator;control theory;signal-to-noise ratio;communication channel	Mobile	36.55902481570208	94.36103473228862	138996
3fddad76728051e7fc61a332802aa106f7ff9319	on the feasibility of interference alignment for mimo interference broadcast channels		In this paper, we analyze the feasibility of linear interference alignment (IA) for multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) interference broadcast channel (MIMO-IBC) with constant coefficients. We pose and prove the necessary conditions of linear IA feasibility for general MIMO-IBC. Except for the proper condition, we find another necessary condition to ensure a kind of irreducible interference to be eliminated. We then prove the necessary and sufficient conditions for a special class of MIMO-IBC, where the numbers of antennas are divisible by the number of data streams per user. Since finding an invertible Jacobian matrix is crucial for the sufficiency proof, we first analyze the impact of sparse structure and repeated structure of the Jacobian matrix. Considering that for the MIMO-IBC the sub-matrices of the Jacobian matrix corresponding to the transmit and receive matrices have different repeated structure, we find an invertible Jacobian matrix by constructing the two sub-matrices separately. We show that for the MIMO-IBC where each user has one desired data stream, a proper system is feasible. For symmetric MIMO-IBC, we provide proper but infeasible region of antenna configurations by analyzing the difference between the necessary conditions and the sufficient conditions of linear IA feasibility.	interference (communication);mimo	Tingting Liu;Chenyang Yang	2012	CoRR		3g mimo;co-channel interference	Crypto	42.094181139403176	88.85183302782974	139020

We model the target with a priori known target impulse response (TIR) structure along with an unknown reflection factor. As is known, the performance of the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) detector, for the case at hand, monotonically increases with the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Hence, we deal with the code design problem via maximizing the SINR. We also enforce a peak-to-average power ratio (PAR) constraint on the sought code. We devise a cyclic method to tackle the highly non-convex design problem.

11e332732a5c4c07248728dea5eb659d4e6c2784	a novel resource optimization scheme for multi-cell ofdma relay network	intra cell communication two way relay subcarrier assignment subcarrier pairing	In cellular networks, users communicate with each other through their respective base stations (BSs). Conventionally, users are assumed to be in different cells. BSs serve as decode-and-forward (DF) relay nodes to users. In addition to this type of conventional user, we recognize that there are scenarios users who want to communicate with each other are located in the same cell. This gives rise to the scenario of intra-cell communication. In this case, a BS can behave as a two-way relay to achieve information exchange instead of using conventional DF relay. We consider a multi-cell orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) network that comprises these two types of users. We are interested in resource allocation between them. Specifically, we jointly optimize subcarrier assignment, subcarrier pairing, and power allocation to maximize the weighted sum rate. We consider the resource allocation problem at BSs when the end users’ power is fixed. We solve the problem approximately through Lagrange dual decomposition. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes outperform other existing schemes.	algorithm;cell signaling;convex optimization;direction finding;frequency divider;information exchange;lagrange multiplier;lagrangian relaxation;mahdiyar;mathematical optimization;mobile phone;numerical analysis;optimization problem;relay;simulation;subcarrier;telecommunications link;weight function	Ning Du;Fa-Sheng Liu	2016	Frontiers of Information Technology & Electronic Engineering	10.1631/FITEE.1500294	telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	31.395366226859682	92.3505836496835	139863

7120aa0d2b78e75eda582aa89be54dd7e2c3b169	joint optimization of channel selection and frame scheduling for coexistence of lte and wlan		Recently, the interest in operating long term evolution (LTE) in unlicensed bands (i.e., LTE-U) has increased. However, since LTE does not sense for channel vacancy prior to transmissions, whereas a wireless local area network (WLAN) is based on carrier sensing multiple access, LTE interference severely degrades the performance of WLAN. To maximize the LTE throughput while maintaining fairness between LTE and WLAN, we formulate a joint optimization problem of channel selection and frame scheduling in LTE. As a practical solution of this problem, we propose a low-complexity heuristic algorithm called the sequential operation algorithm (SOA). Evaluation results demonstrate that SOA can achieve an LTE throughput comparable to that of the optimal solution, while maintaining fairness between LTE and WLAN by selecting appropriate channels and conducting effective frame scheduling.	algorithm;coexist (image);compaq lte;fairness measure;heuristic (computer science);interference (communication);mathematical optimization;optimization problem;scheduling (computing);throughput	Haneul Ko;Jaewook Lee;Sangheon Pack	2018	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2018.2805767	throughput;computer network;heuristic (computer science);scheduling (computing);wi-fi;computer science;communication channel;optimization problem	Mobile	27.84451146350532	92.23137611506465	140298

0de756fbc6ecec8d76ea92342470fd9769020d39	design and demonstration of an indoor visible light communication network with dynamic user access and resource allocation		We design and realize an indoor visible light communication (VLC) network based on the time division mechanism to mitigate inter-cell interference, which can support flexible access and resource allocation of multiple mobile users in the ultra-dense attocell layout. WiFi is adopted for the uplink feedback, including the user ID and channel state information. After receiving feedback, the central coordinator is capable of performing mobile user access, localization, handoff control and resource allocation. The data sent from the central coordinator is buffered at the distributed base stations within the attocells, and then transmitted to the scheduled user by downlink VLC. A real-time experimental platform including three attocells and two users is built up to evaluate the performance of the proposed VLC network. Furthermore, off-line measurements are conducted to find the optimal operating point of the system. Experimental results show that the bit error rate (BER) of the real-time transmission is below 6.3091 × 10−5, and the frame loss rates (FLRs) of static user and mobile user are about 0.1% and 8.2%, respectively.	an/flr-9;bit error rate;channel state information;data rate units;interference (communication);internationalization and localization;modulation;online and offline;operating point;real-time clock;telecommunications link;telecommunications network;throughput;transmitter;vlc media player;x.690	Mian Zeng;Kaixiong Zhou;Chen Gong;Shun Lou;Xianqing Jin;Zhengyuan Xu	2017	2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170965	computer network;bit error rate;computer science;real-time computing;handover;channel state information;telecommunications link;user identifier;visible light communication;resource allocation;base station	Mobile	28.51980458356259	90.68408708074675	141096
75181e314d4d6452b7912b8174d82e38c4caaf82	mimo-ofdm based energy harvesting cooperative communications using coalitional game algorithm		In this paper, we consider the problem of cooperative communication between relays and base station in an advanced Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) framework, under the assumption that the relays are supplied by electric power drawn from energy harvesting (EH) sources. In particular, we focus on the relay selection, with the goal to guarantee the required performance in terms of capacity. In order to maximize the data throughput under the EH constraint, we model the transmission scheme as a nontransferable coalition formation game, with characteristic function based on an approximated capacity expression. Then, we introduce a powerful mathematical tool inherent to coalitional game theory, namely: The Shapley value to provide a reliable solution concept to the game. The selected relays will form a virtual dynamically-configured MIMO network that is able to transmit data to destination using efficient space-time coding techniques. Numerical results, obtained by simulating the EH-powered cooperative MIMO-OFDM transmission with algebraic space-time coding, prove that the proposed coalitional game-based relay selection allows us to achieve performance very close to that obtained by the same system operated by guaranteed power supply. The proposed methodology is finally compared with some recent related state-of-the-art techniques showing clear advantages in terms of link performance and goodput.	acknowledgement (data networks);adaptive scalable texture compression;approximation algorithm;binary logarithm;channel capacity;characteristic function (convex analysis);computation;cooperative mimo;data compression;emoticon;exception handling;exponential hierarchy;fink;game theory;goodput;linear system;mimo-ofdm;multiplexing;nash equilibrium;power supply;proof of existence;relay;scott continuity;simulation;stable marriage problem;stationary process;strategic management;subcarrier;switch;throughput;time complexity;tomotaka takahashi;unicity distance	Ahmed Bannour;Claudio Sacchi;Yichuang Sun	2017	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2017.2768622	game theory;throughput;computer network;solution concept;mimo;goodput;simulation;distributed computing;mimo-ofdm;computer science;relay;shapley value	Metrics	33.32048647433191	94.18483188241517	141515
1a128deef0ed18f03ced113ab2b92cf939e91699	joint resource allocation with interference constraint for cognitive multi-hop wireless networks		In this paper, we propose a secondary user (SU) resource assignment algorithm for a multi-hop (MH) cognitive radio network to improve the end-to-end throughput. In the MH networks used for spectrum sharing, each SU needs to improve the throughput by taking the primary user (PU) protection into account. For overcoming this problem, we estimate the PU acceptable received power, which is determined by the acknowledgment packet (ACK) power from the PU receiver at each SU. With this estimation, we propose an SU optimal transmit power control algorithm to not only maximize the end-to-end throughput of the SU MH flow but also maintain the considered PU acceptable interference power. In this study, a distributed joint allocation algorithm has been used to solve the optimization problem and to effectively allocate the power of each SU. key words: cognitive radio, multi-hop network, resource allocation, joint allocation	acknowledgement (data networks);acknowledgment index;algorithm;cognitive radio;end-to-end principle;hop;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;modified huffman coding;network packet;optimization problem;superuser;throughput	Shuta Kako;Osamu Takyu;Takeo Fujii	2015	IEICE Transactions		cognitive radio;max-min fairness;resource allocation;computer science;radio resource management	Mobile	32.93504021161414	89.81199850069953	141530

As wired backhaul solutions may not be always practical or feasible, in this paper we consider wireless in-band backhaul for a network with macro cells and small cells. To improve the overall user experience in the network, efficient resource allocation and transmission schemes taking into account of both backhaul links and access links are proposed and associated optimization problems are formulated.

Heterogeneous networks (HetNets) have been considered as a new promising technique for expanding network coverage and improving EE. Robust resource allocation is a huge challenge when uncertainty parameters are involved in this issue. The problem is more significant in HetNets since perfect channel state information is not available at femtocell base station’s transmitters. In this paper, we study the downlink resource allocation in HetNets under outage probability constraint, and formulate the EE maximization problem as a nonlinear fractional programming problem. In order to solve the fractional programming problem, firstly, we transform the original problem into an equivalent optimization problem in a parametric subtractive form. Then based on the exponential distribution model under Rayleigh fading environment, the probability constraint is transformed into a deterministic constraint. Finally, we propose a two-loop iteration algorithm to find the optimal solution by using Dinkelbachs method and Lagrangian dual decomposition method. Simulation results demonstrate the convergence and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

As the spectrum of interest is licenced to primary network, power control must be carried out within the CR system so that no excessive interference is caused to PUs. In this study, the problem of power control is investigated in CR systems based on game theory subject to interference power constraint at PU and the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint of each CU. The objective is to reduce the power consumption caused by some CUs’ SINR over the target value. First, a non-cooperation power control game is formulated, and then an adaptive power control algorithm based on feedback function is proposed. Moreover, the existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium are proved. Simulation results show that, compared with other distributed algorithms, the proposed algorithm can reduce the power consumption and overcome the near-far effect.	coexist (image);cognitive radio;control theory;distributed algorithm;frequency band;game theory;interference (communication);nash equilibrium;one-class classification;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;tip (unix utility)	Guanglong Yang;Bin Li;Xuezhi Tan;Xiao Wang	2015	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2014.1109	game theory;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;cognitive radio;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics;nash equilibrium;statistics;computer network	Mobile	33.212895054264166	92.60701717070356	142230

This paper evaluates the performance of three RAT selection algorithms, load balancing based using maximum resource consumption, load balancing based using minimum resource consumption and service based algorithms, in terms of traffic distribution, blocking probability, throughput and throughput fairness for a co-located GERAN/UTRAN/WLAN network. Simulation results show that in terms of blocking probability, the service based algorithm is the worst one when the traffic load is high. In terms of data throughput, the load balancing based using maximum resource consumption algorithm performs better than the other two when the traffic load is low. However, the service based algorithm outperforms the other two when the traffic load is high. In terms of throughput fairness, the service based algorithm achieves the best performance.	blocking (computing);erlang (unit);fairness measure;heterogeneous computing;load balancing (computing);next-generation network;performance evaluation;quality of service;radio resource management;selection algorithm;simulation;throughput	Leijia Wu;Abdallah E.

In this context, we proposed a new Uplink scheduling scheme for LTE networks and compared its performances with other well known algorithms such as the RME (Recursive Maximum Expansion), the RR (Round Robin) and the BCQI (Best-CQI) Uplink scheduler's algorithms. The RR scheduler is characterized by a high fairness, but low data rates at cell level. On the other hand, the RME scheduler is characterized by its low complexity, but poor fairness. Also, the BCQI scheme is characterized by high data rates, but poor fairness. The main goal of our proposed scheme was to use the Tabu method for to schedule and optimize the allocation of a PRBs (Physical Resource Blocks) efficiently between different users. Simulation results show that the newly proposed scheduling algorithm allows a fair distribution of available LTE resources while keeping an high system's throughput.	algorithm;compaq lte;fairness measure;network packet;performance;radio resource management;recursion (computer science);round-robin scheduling;scheduling (computing);simulation;tabu search;telecommunications link;throughput	Radhia Khdhir;Kais Mnif;Lotfi Kamoun;Loutfi Nuaymi	2014	The 2014 International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications	10.1109/SNCC.2014.6866533	fair-share scheduling;real-time computing;earliest deadline first scheduling;dynamic priority scheduling;rate-monotonic scheduling;distributed computing;round-robin scheduling;computer network	HPC	27.58719227378402	92.7299022902608	142878

However, the severe interference under dense TP deployment in UCN from co-channel neighbor cell worsens the user performance. In this paper, to combat the fluctuation of user rate, a user-centric power control strategy is proposed, where TPs will take power control coefficient β to effectively mitigate the strong interference for each user within TPG of radius coefficient μ. Based on the strategy, semi-closed expressions of network downlink performance metric are first derived, including coverage probability and average achievable rate to the typical user, and average spectral efficiency of TP with the consideration of the impact of TPG overlapping on the signal link. The TPs and the users are modeled as independent 2-D Poisson point processes. The theoretical analysis confirms that the optimization of β and μ, which determine the area and intensity for power control, respectively, can realize the tradeoff between interference mitigation and resource utilization. Numerical results demonstrate significant performance gains of the user-centric power control strategy in coverage probability, average achievable user rate, and TP spectral efficiency, which can be improved at most by 30%, 15%, and 42%, respectively. In addition, the analysis gives the optimal values of β and μ according to the distance between TP and user.	coefficient;control theory;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;profiling (computer programming);quantum fluctuation;semiconductor industry;software deployment;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;time complexity	Hongtao Zhang;Zihua Yang;Yang Liu;Xing Zhang	2016	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2621183	user-centered design;real-time computing;telecommunications;power transmission;power control;computer science;operating system;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	26.150971354447847	89.57084586549149	142974

However, if relay nodes are supported, forming an efficient multicast topology is a challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a multi- hop multicast recipient maximization scheme for wireless relay networks. First, we formulate an important problem called Multi-Hop Recipient Maximization (MHRM), which involves allocating resources to the base-station and relay stations efficiently in order to maximize the number of recipients with the given budget and channel conditions. To solve MHRM, we propose a heuristic called Multicast Path Selection (MPS). We prove that MHRM is NP-hard, and also analyze MPS's computational complexity. The results of simulations conducted to evaluate the heuristic's performance demonstrate that, under variant conditions, MPS utilizes bandwidth resources and relay nodes effectively such that it significantly outperforms all existing approaches. To the best of our knowledge, MPS is the only scheme that focuses on this important issue and achieves such a satisfactory performance.	access network;broadcast relay station;computational complexity theory;entropy maximization;expectation–maximization algorithm;heuristic;hop;multicast;np-hardness;rss;simulation;wireless access point	Wen-Hsing Kuo	2011	2011 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference - GLOBECOM 2011	10.1109/GLOCOM.2011.6134536	multicast;decision support system;telecommunications;computer science;base station;resource management;operating system;distributed computing;source-specific multicast;computational complexity theory;xcast;wireless;computer network	Mobile	29.541473589192705	93.10180518767164	142981

State of the art MRO solutions have relied on expert knowledge, rule based algorithms to search the parameter space; yet it is unwieldy to design rules for all possible mobility patterns in any network. In this work, we present a Q-learning MRO solution, QMRO, which learns the required parameter values appropriate for specific velocity conditions in the individual cells. We compare QMRO against the best static reference configuration (Ref) that is obtained by sweeping the parameter space. Our results show that QMRO is able to learn parameter settings that achieve similar performance to Ref in a realistic network environment where users have dynamically varying velocities.	algorithm;autonomous robot;compaq lte;congruence of squares;hysteresis;lattice boltzmann methods;load balancing (computing);mathematical optimization;q-learning;self-organization;velocity (software development)	Stephen S.

We first propose a simple channel norm (CN) based scheme, which enables low-complexity implementation. Then, we propose a near-optimal user scheduling by jointly considering the pair-wise channels norms and orthogonality among all the users (CNO-A), which requires global channel state information (CSI) and centralized computation at the relay. It is noted that CNO-A scheme can achieve comparable performance as the optimal scheduling with reduced computational complexity. Finally, we propose a two-step selective CNO scheme (CNO-S), which strikes a flexible balance between complexity/CSI overhead and performance. CNO-S significantly reduces CSI overhead and computational complexity at the relay, while achieving comparable performance as the CNO-A scheme. Numerical results and complexity analysis not only show that the proposed schemes are feasible and effective, but also demonstrate their advantages over the existing schemes.	analysis of algorithms;anisotropic filtering;centralized computing;channel state information;computation;computational complexity theory;information exchange;linear network coding;numerical method;overhead (computing);relay channel;scheduling (computing)	Yan Wang;Hui Gao;Chau Yuen;Tiejun Lv	2015	2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145921	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;relay channel	Mobile	37.716780114378146	88.71471333444335	143063

The considered energy efficiency maximization problem which takes both dynamic and static power consumption into account is non-convex and hard to tackle. To address it, the optimization problem is first transformed into a parametric subtractive form using the classical fractional programming method. Then, by introducing the concept of the interference temperature used in cognitive radio networks, the parameterized subtractive form optimization problem is further decomposed into a master problem and a set of subproblems. Based on that, we exploit the convex approximation to develop a decentralized multi-cell multi-user algorithm, which is shown to converge and only needs limited information exchange between the coordinated BSs. Numerical results show that the proposed decentralized energy efficiency algorithm outperforms conventional power allocation algorithms and exhibits a performance close to the optimal centralized solution.	algorithm;algorithm design;approximation;beamforming;centralized computing;cognitive radio;converge;entropy maximization;fractional programming;information exchange;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;memory management;multi-user;numerical method;optimization problem;telecommunications link	Shiwen He;Wenyang Chen;Yongming Huang;Shi Jin;Lei Jiang;Gang Wang	2015	2015 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2015.7127527	fractional programming;mathematical optimization;cognitive radio;real-time computing;computer science;resource management	EDA	36.456576752768825	90.5714736861639	143576

The signal-to-noise-plus-interference (SINR) of the filter output is considered as the performance measure of the system. The design problem is cast as a max-min optimization problem to robustify the system SINR with respect to the unknown Doppler shifts of the targets. To tackle the design problem, which belongs to a class of NP-hard problems, we devise a novel method (which we call DESIDE) to obtain optimized pairs of transmit sequence and receive filter sharing the desired robustness property. The proposed method is based on a cyclic maximization of SINR expressions with relaxed rank-one constraints, and is followed by a novel synthesis stage. We devise synthesis algorithms to obtain high quality pairs of transmit sequence and receive filter that well approximate the behavior of the optimal SINR (of the relaxed problem) with respect to target Doppler shift. Several numerical examples are provided to analyze the performance obtained by DESIDE.	approximation algorithm;display resolution;doppler effect;expectation–maximization algorithm;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;np-hardness;numerical analysis;optimization problem;robustification;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio	Mohammad Mahdi Naghsh;Mojtaba Soltanalian;Petre Stoica;Mahmood Modarres-Hashemi;Antonio De Maio;Augusto Aubry	2014	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2013.2288082	doppler effect;telecommunications;signal processing;root-raised-cosine filter;control theory;interference	EDA	41.280743357234094	90.7429955323466	143672

D2D enables direct communication between mobile devices over the cellular band without utilizing infrastructure nodes such as base stations, thereby reducing the load on cellular base stations and increasing network throughput through spatial reuse of radio resources. Hence it is important to optimally allocate these radio resources. Furthermore, since the composition of a cellular macro cell is highly dynamic, it is critical to adaptively update the resource allocation for D2D communications rather than recomputing it from scratch. In this work, we develop the first online algorithm, namely ODSRA, for dynamic resource allocation while maximizing spatial reuse. At the core of the resource allocation problem is the online set multicover problem, for which we present the first deterministic O (log n log m)-competitive online algorithm, where n is the number of elements, and m the number of sets. By simulation, we show the efficacy of ODSRA by analyzing network throughput and other metrics, obtaining a large improvement in running time over offline methods.	approximation algorithm;baseline (configuration management);deterministic algorithm;expectation–maximization algorithm;ibm notes;list of software based on kodi and xbmc;mobile device;online algorithm;online and offline;randomized algorithm;simulation;spatial multiplexing;throughput;time complexity;vii	Alan Kuhnle;Xiang Li;My T.

In order to make the optimization problem tractable, we decompose the original problem into three sub-problems. Firstly, we derive the average outage probability function of the system with respect to the channel reuse radius. With a given outage probability threshold, the associated range of the channel reuse radius is obtained. In addition, a fairness-based distributed resource allocation (FDRA) algorithm is proposed to guarantee the fairness among cognitive small cell base stations (CSBSs). Finally, based on the channel reuse range we could find the maximum throughput of the small cell network tire. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FDRA algorithm could achieve a considerable performance improvement relative to the schemes in literature, while providing a better fairness among CSBSs.

Specifically, we propose beamforming (BF) schemes to utilize the interference from the terrestrial network as a green source to enhance the physical-layer security for the satellite network, provided that the two networks share the portion of millimeter-wave frequencies. Supposing that the satellite employs multibeam antenna while the base station is equipped with a uniform planar array, we first formulate a constrained joint optimization problem to minimize the total transmit power while satisfying both the quality-of-service requirement of the terrestrial user and the secrecy rate (SR) requirements of the satellite users. Since the formulated optimization problem is nonconvex and mathematically intractable, we then propose two BF schemes to obtain the optimal solutions with high computational efficiency. For the case of one eavesdropper (Eve), we present a method to convert the nonconvex SR constraint to a second-order cone one and then adopt a penalty function approach to obtain the BF weight vectors. In the case of multiple Eves, by introducing a list of auxiliary variables, we propose a two-layer iterative BF scheme using penalty function approach together with gradient-based method to calculate the BF weight vectors. Finally, simulation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed BF schemes.	algorithm;beamforming;brainfuck;computer simulation;constrained optimization;constraint (mathematics);etsi satellite digital radio;eve;gradient;interference (communication);inverted-f antenna;iterative method;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;penalty method;quality of service;requirement;same-day affirmation;second-order cone programming;secure communication;super-twisted nematic display;terrestrial television	Min Lin;Zhi Lin;Jun Yan;Jun-Bo Wang	2018	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2018.2832819	penalty method;mathematical optimization;transmitter power output;real-time computing;computer science;wireless;beamforming;base station;optimization problem;secure communication;resource allocation	Mobile	31.955958649582318	92.06437176677674	144150

VERUM is an adaptation of the well known Ausubel's clinching auction [1] to suit the dynamic spectrum sharing context. As a use case for VERUM, we consider TV white space (TVWS) spectrum sharing among home networks, and compare VERUM with two existing efficient and truthful multi-unit spectrum auction schemes, VERITAS and SATYA. Our evaluations, using real distributions of homes in a dense urban neighborhood in London and realistic TVWS spectrum availability maps for the UK, show that VERUM outperforms the other two schemes in terms of revenue, spectrum utilization and percentage of winning bidders.	iterative method;map;marginal model;privacy;white spaces (radio);whole earth 'lectronic link	Saravana Manickam;Mahesh K.

In this set-up, the resources of an OFDMA-based wireless network are shared among different slices where the minimum reserved rate is considered as the quality-of-service (QoS) requirement of each slice. We formulate the robust resource allocation problem against the worst-case CSI uncertainty, aiming to maximize the overall energy efficiency (EE) of VWN in terms of a newly defined slice utility function. Uncertain CSI is modeled as the sum of its true estimated value and an error assumed to be bounded in a specific uncertainty region. The formulated problem suffers from two major issues: computational complexity and energy-efficiency degradation due to the considered error in the maximum extent. To deal with these issues, we consider a specific form of uncertainty region to solve the robust resource allocation problem via an iterative algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

This is envisioned to deliver higher rate data services in flexible and cost-effective manner. However, in the HetNets, due to the coexistence of various nodes, traffic load variations are more pronounced which requires more dynamic resource management. On the other side, the effective management of resource can significantly impact on the experience of user equipment (UE) and network's performance. In this paper, we address a joint UE association (UEA) and downlink resource allocation problem in the HetNets. In this regard, we propose a UEA policy based on base stations' (BSs') estimated load and signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio at the location of UE. Furthermore, we apply a self- organizing mechanism to allocate the resource for jointly optimizing the power and channel allocation in a fully distributed way. Our proposed joint UEA and self-organizing resource allocation balances load among BSs and improves the energy efficiency of the network. Simulation results show that our proposed joint UEA and resource allocation yields significant performance gains up to 26.4% and 22% compared to the other benchmark schemes in terms of average energy consumption and average BS load, respectively.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);coexist (image);interference (communication);load balancing (computing);organizing (structure);self-organization;simulation;software deployment;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link	Atefeh Hajijamali Arani;Abolfazl Mehbodniya;Mohammad Javad Omidi;Fumiyuki Adachi	2016	2016 IEEE 84th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2016.7880962	real-time computing;network switch;computer science;engineering;resource management;wireless network;interference;computer network	Mobile	26.248151058792814	91.09311625092643	144616

c930bdb88ebb64fcf99e51d6f5f07347febeea27	optimal channel assignment schemes in underlay crns with multi-pu and multi-su transmission pairs		In underlay spectrum sharing scheme, both channel assignment and power allocation will affect network performance such as throughput, etc. This paper first defines the joint channel and power control problem, which aims to optimize the max-total and max-min throughput of SUs, with interference constraints on primary receivers. For the max-total problem, we formulate the problem as a bipartite matching and derive a maximum weighted matching based algorithm STMA to solve this problem. For the max-min problem, on the basis of the ORA algorithm, we derive a polynomial time algorithm OCAA to iteratively assign the channels to each SU pair under the power constraint. Simulation demonstrates, the throughput of SU network grows with the maximum transmission power of SUs below the interference power of PUs. STMA algorithm achieves an average of 46.67 % performance gain when path loss component (alpha =2 ) and 13.08 % enhancement when (alpha =3 ) compared with random algorithm. The OCAA algorithm effectively ensures the max-min fairness of the capacity among SU pairs in finite iterations and achieves at least 97 % performance gain than the random method under most cases.	one-class classification	Long Chen;Liusheng Huang;Hongli Xu;Hou Deng;Zehao Sun	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-21837-3_4	time complexity;power control;computer science;throughput;distributed computing;randomized algorithm;network performance;max-min fairness;bipartite graph;communication channel	Crypto	33.83112580863523	91.17869734971949	145446
aed577b6bdc78bf562643cb52a48cc8d79d8335a	radio resource management in lte femtocell networks		In wireless network system the resources are limited. Therefore, managing resources is considered as a challenging task. The resource are distributed among attached UEs, so allocating resources needs to be well controlled. Packet scheduler in LTE network is responsible for assigning resources to attached UEs. Also, femtocell network is considered as promising solution for poor channel in indoor environment. Femtocell deployment within macrocell (traditional base station) would increase the capacity of the cell. Therefore, incubating robust Packet Scheduler scheme within femtocell would deliver better capacity. In this work Packet Scheduler scheme is proposed. It performs with consideration of maximizing the capacity as well as preserving the fairness among UEs. A simulation is conducted in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme. The result shows that it outperforms well-known PF scheduler in terms of cell aggregated throughput and average throughput of UEs.	compaq lte;fairness measure;maximum throughput scheduling;network scheduler;pf (firewall);radio resource management;round-robin scheduling;scheduling (computing);simulation;software deployment;telecommunications link;throughput	Sultan Alotaibi;Robert Akl	2017	2017 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications (NCA)	10.1109/NCA.2017.8171396	network scheduler;throughput;computer network;wireless network;radio resource management;computer science;macrocell;resource management;scheduling (computing);femtocell	Mobile	26.00894507144293	91.29795698529854	145514

fdb0de8732954f7e488035e8d361c7c1b9d1888b	brains: joint bandwidth-relay allocation in multihoming cooperative d2d networks		Cooperative device-to-device (CD2D) communication has been considered to be a solution to capacity shortage problem. Combining multihoming and CD2D techniques together can potentially improve network performance. We propose a novel multihoming CD2D network, in which multiple homing mobile devices (MMDs) act as relays for the cooperative communications of ordinary mobile devices (OMDs). We formulate such joint bandwidth-relay allocation problem as a two-stage game, in order to deal with two challenges: how to motivate MMDs to lease spare bandwidths and help OMDs to choose appropriate MMD relays. In the first stage, we use a noncooperative game to model the competition between MMDs in terms of shared bandwidth and price. In the second stage, we model the behavior of OMDs selecting MMDs by an evolutionary game. We prove that there exists Nash equilibrium in the game and propose a distributed incentive scheme named incentive mechanism for efficient bandwidth relay sharing (IMES) to solve the joint bandwidth-relay allocation problem. Extensive simulation results show that the equilibrium can be achieved and the best response price of one MMD increases with the other's best price in the Stackelberg game. The utility of MMDs increases with the number of OMDs in each OMD group at the evolutionary equilibrium. The proposed algorithms are able to reduce average service delay by more than $25\%$ in comparison to the randomized scheme, which is frequently used in existing works. On average, IMES outperforms existing scheme by about $20.37\%$ in terms of utility of MMDs.	fairness measure;interference (communication);mikumikudance;mobile device;modified huffman coding;multihoming;multiple homing;nash equilibrium;network performance;polynomial-time approximation scheme;randomized algorithm;relay;simulation;terms of service	Long Chen;Jigang Wu;Hong-Ning Dai;Xiaoxia Huang	2018	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2018.2799970	computer network;multihoming;stackelberg competition;multiple homing;best response;nash equilibrium;computer science;network performance;bandwidth (signal processing);relay	Metrics	31.280363467301598	94.64973480656434	145676

At each slot, a relay and a node along the optimal non-cooperative path are opportunistically selected to transmit to the next-hop node in a cooperative manner. Being a promising scheme for fair resource allocation, the proportional fair scheduling (PFS) algorithm provides excellent balance between throughput and fairness via multi-user diversity and game-theoretic equilibrium. To maximize the overall utility along a cooperative multi-hop path, we apply the proportional fair (PF) criterion in selecting nodes and relays for cooperative transmission. Furthermore, we analyze and provide an analytical expression for end-to-end throughput of an opportunistic relaying, cooperative multi-hop path with proportional fairness constraints over a Rayleigh flat-fading channel. To our knowledge, it is the first time that a closed-form expression is obtained for the throughput of a proportional fair relaying, cooperative multi-hop path. This research is an extension of previous theoretical work on PF for cellular networks.	algorithm;end-to-end principle;fair-share scheduling;fairness measure;forward secrecy;game theory;hop;multi-user;proportionally fair;quality of service;rayleigh–ritz method;relay;scheduling (computing);throughput	Erwu Liu;Qinqing Zhang;Kin K.

Although some work has been done for dynamic spectrum access, the learning capability of cognitive radio networks is largely ignored in the previous work. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement-learning-based double auction algorithm aiming to improve the performance of dynamic spectrum access in cognitive radio networks. The dynamic spectrum access process is modeled as a double auction game. Based on the spectrum access history information, both primary users and secondary users can estimate the impact on their future rewards and then adapt their spectrum access or release strategies effectively to compete for channel opportunities. Simulation results show that the proposed reinforcement-learning-based double auction algorithm can significantly improve secondary users’ performance in terms of packet loss, bidding efficiency and transmission rate or opportunity access.	auction algorithm;cognitive radio;expected utility hypothesis;network packet;network performance;observed information;q-learning;rl (complexity);reinforcement learning;reserved word;simulation	Yinglei Teng;Fei Richard Yu;Ke Han;Yifei Wei;Yong Zhang	2013	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-012-0611-9	cognitive radio;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;double auction;reinforcement learning;computer network	Mobile	28.233999822681984	97.78350549938752	145810

Signal constellation design is an important problem for all kinds of communications. In this paper, we try to design the signal constellation for the intensity modulated FSO communications. A channel model is first established, which includes atmospheric loss, atmospheric turbulence and pointing error. Under the constraints of non-negativity, peak power and average power, a signal space is obtained. Then, a distance measure based on the non-coherent maximum likelihood detection is introduced. By maximizing the minimum distance, the signal constellation optimization problem is formulated. After that, an interior point method based algorithm is given to solve the optimization problem. Simulation results are presented to show the derived signal constellation.	algorithm;channel (communications);coherence (physics);interior point method;mathematical optimization;modulation;negativity (quantum mechanics);optimization problem;simulation;turbulence	Jin-yuan Wang;Jun-Bo Wang;Ming Chen	2014	9th International Conference on Communications and Networking in China	10.1109/CHINACOM.2014.7054302	atmospheric model;coherence;constellation diagram;telecommunications;intensity modulation;adaptive optics;wireless;optical communications repeater	EDA	40.342061338543395	89.9920896141902	145815

This is a challenging task due to the lack of a suitable closed form expression of the multiuser interference in a multi-rate context. Moreover, an exhaustive search for the optimal solution would be too prohibitive due to the high complexity induced. Our contribution can be summarized as follows: i) A new expression of the multiuser interference variance accounting for multi-rate communications is proposed. ii) Thanks to this, a computational efficient multi-rate allocation scheme is proposed. The algorithm allows to achieve high throughput while keeping a relatively low starvation rate and it outperforms a Max-Min algorithm with a fix rate for all users. Moreover, the simulations based on the theoretical analysis give insights on the influence of the different UWB parameters on the global throughput.	algorithm;brute-force search;catastrophic interference;computation;free variables and bound variables;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;interference (communication);maximum throughput scheduling;multi-user;performance;simulation;telecommunications link;throughput;ultra-wideband	Philippe Mary;Inbar Fijalkow;Charly Poulliat	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/icc.2011.5963113	high-throughput screening;time-hopping;throughput;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;ultra-wideband;brute-force search;interference;signal-to-noise ratio;computer network	HPC	33.530515619358454	90.78998139935946	146015

In this paper, we address these issues using a two-level dynamic scheme. First, we assign the MUs with the optimum number of subchannels that achieves an operator's required balance between macro users' satisfaction and maximization of network efficiency. Then, the remaining subchannels are left to be shared by a number of small cells. In the latter step, a transmit power adaptation method using a noncooperative game-theoretic approach is developed to reduce cochannel interference in the whole network. The problem is formulated by allowing multiple neighboring small cells to share each subchannel (i.e., universal frequency reuse in the small cell level). We fully characterize the pricing factor in the penalty part of the utility function. The existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium (NE) are analyzed and proved. Then, a distributed iterative algorithm based on the fixed-point theorem is proposed to attain the equilibrium of the game. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in different network topologies.	digital subchannel;expectation–maximization algorithm;fixed-point theorem;game theory;interference (communication);iterative method;nash equilibrium;network topology;simulation;utility	Ali Y.

9ad293e584c5c0fe411601c760d4584a58a1eb41	gospal: an efficient strategy-proof mechanism for constrained resource allocation		We consider allocation of a resource to multiple interested users with a constraint that if the resource is allocated to user i, then it cannot be allocated simultaneously to a predefined set of users si. This scenario arises in many practical systems that include wireless networks and constrained queuing systems. It is known that the socially optimal strategy-proof mechanism is not only NP-hard, but it is also hard to approximate. This renders optimal mechanism computationally infeasible to use in practice. Here, we propose a computationally efficient mechanism and prove it to be strategy-proof. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the social utility of the proposed scheme is close to that of the optimal. Further, we demonstrate how the proposed mechanism can be used for fair and efficient short-term spectrum allocation in resource-constrained large wireless networks.

The spectrum of interest is divided into a set of independent, orthogonal subchannels. The communication of the PU is of high priority and the quality of service (QoS) is guaranteed by the minimum rate constraint. On the other hand, the communication of the SU is of low priority and the SU opportunistically accesses the subchannels that were previously discarded by the PU during power allocation. The BS assigns fractions ?? and ?? of the total available transmit power to the PU and the SU respectively. Two power allocation schemes with opportunistic subchannel access are proposed, in which the optimal values of ??’s are also obtained. The objective of one scheme is to maximize the rate of the SU, and the objective of the other scheme is to maximize the sum rate of the SU and the PU, both under the PU minimum rate constraint and the total transmit power constraint. Extensive simulation results are obtained to verify the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.

This paper aims to set up a framework for joint resource allocation in the forward link of a multi-cell wireless multimedia system. The approach we take is based on the notion of utility. That is, each user, or each class of users, is assumed to have a utility function that describes the user's monetary satisfaction, namely utility, as a function of received quality of service (QoS). We concentrate on revenue maximization, namely, the objective is to maximize the total profit generated by selling the resource to users. In addition to their scientific merit, the results are of high value to manufacturers of cellular infrastructures and network operators alike. We characterize the optimal prices and the optimal resource partition between voice and data services for an individual cell with limited power or rate. Two-cell revenue maximization has been investigated. With limited power, not all power needs to be used when the revenue is maximized.	expectation–maximization algorithm;mathematical optimization;quality of service;telecommunications link;utility	Chi Zhou;Dayou Qian;Niki Pissinou;Kia Makki	2004	2004 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (IEEE Cat.

b6e7ae0362719e69cbffab35b60675420954866d	a colonel blotto game for anti-jamming in the internet of things		The Internet of Things (IoT) is envisioned to be a large-scale system that interconnects sensors, mundane objects, and other physical devices via an effective communication infrastructure. Given the heterogeneous and large-scale nature of the IoT, security has emerged as a key challenge. This challenge is further exacerbated by the fact that security solutions for the IoT must account for the limited computational capabilities of the IoT's nodes. That makes enhancing the security at the physical layer level an attractive solution for IoT networks. In this paper, a novel anti- jamming mechanism is proposed to enable a fusion center to defend the IoT from a malicious radio jamming attack. The problem is formulated as a Colonel Blotto game in which the fusion center, acting as defender, aims to detect the jamming attack by increasing the number of bits allocated to certain nodes for reporting their measured interference level, while the jammer aims to disturb the network performance and still be undetected. To solve this game, an algorithm based on fictitious play is proposed to reach the equilibrium of the game. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism outperforms the mechanism of allocating the available bits in a random manner for two different cases of network architecture.	algorithm;converge;electrical connection;electronic counter-countermeasure;interference (communication);internet of things;iteration;nash equilibrium;network architecture;network performance;radio jamming;sensor;simulation;tree network	Mina Labib;Sean Ha;Walid Saad;Jeffrey H.

It refers to an innovative technology that enables User Equipments (UEs) to communicate directly with each other without using the eNodeB. This is indeed a challenging technique for mission-critical communications, e.g. in public protection and disaster relief (PPDR) application. In such a critical application, energy efficiency is an important factor for long and reliable communication. This can be achieved using more spectrum applying the D2D paradigm in Heterogeneous Networks (HetNet). In this work, we simulate an LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) HetNet consisting of both macro and pico Base Stations (BSs). Spectrum allocation and mode selection is devised for the associated UEs in order to enhance their energy efficiency that will lead to higher lifetime. In particular, a number of Component Carriers (CC) are considered available for allocation to the BSs in order to utilize Carrier Aggregation (CA) of LTE-A while mode selection decisions are made by each BS in order to balance between power consumption minimization and UE target data rate achievement. Under this framework, a power minimization problem is formulated in order to provide a joint spectrum allocation and mode selection. This problem is solved using a state of the art optimization method known as proximal minimization algorithm. The obtained simulation results reveal the energy efficient spectrum allocation and mode selection according to channels' quality that can balance between achieving high data rate requirements and power minimization as an important factor to mission-critical applications such as PPDR services.	algorithm;apollonian network;compaq lte;data rate units;frequency allocation;mathematical optimization;mission critical;multi-user;programming paradigm;requirement;simulation	Apostolos Galanopoulos;Konstantinos Kousias;Nikolaidou Aikaterini;Fotis Foukalas;Tamer Khattab	2016	2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)	10.1109/INFCOMW.2016.7562116	telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	26.313093730636254	92.15707458291992	147662
ab0a568390c719e5516b0513ad97a345fffc6bb9	cross-layer qoe optimization for d2d communication in cr-enabled heterogeneous cellular networks		Device-to-device (D2D) communication based on cognitive radio (CR) technology can significantly improve the coverage and spectral efficiency. Existing research on D2D communications mainly focus on optimizing the network quality of service in single-tier networks. However, the exponential growth in data traffic has inspired the move from traditional single-tier cellular networks toward heterogeneous cellular networks. Hence, in this paper, we consider a CR-based HetNet coexisting with cognitive D2D pairs and cellular users, where the cellular users are primary users and D2D pairs are secondary users. Considering quality of experience (QoE) is an important metric to quantify and measure quality of experience from the user perspective, we focus on the QoE optimization of the D2D pairs via the BS association, the discrete power control, and the resource block (RB) assignment. To do so, we first formulate the cross-layer optimization problem to maximize the average QoE of the D2D pairs while satisfying the QoE requirements of cellular users. We then propose the centralized resource allocation, namely the genetic algorithm (GA), and semi-distributed resource allocation method, namely Stackelberg game based algorithm, to solve the non-convex optimization problem. The GA is proposed to ensure the maximum achievable QoE with known channel state information (CSI), whereas the Stackelberg game based algorithm is proposed to cope with the strong needs for distributed D2D solutions with only local CSI of each D2D link. Our proposed algorithms can achieve substantial improvement of QoE performance for D2D pairs via increasing the number of RBs.

The power consumption model is based on a series of step functions that allow to model, among others, radio frequency circuits being on/off and the startup power consumption of the transmitter. After showing that the sum-rate maximization problem is nonsmooth, nonconvex, and NP-hard, the Iterative Smooth and Convex approximation Algorithm (ISCA) is proposed, which successively approximates the step functions by proper smooth functions to obtain a sequence of smooth nonconvex problems that can be solved by means of the successive convex approximation method. It is demonstrated that the ISCA distributedly converges to a stationary solution of the sum-rate maximization problem. For the particular case of point to point communications, the numerical results show that the ISCA is able to avoid bad stationary solutions, performing close to the globally optimal solution. The performance of the ISCA is also evaluated in the interference channel and with real solar energy harvesting data.	approximation algorithm;expectation–maximization algorithm;interference (communication);international symposium on computer architecture;iterative method;maxima and minima;np-hardness;numerical analysis;point-to-point (telecommunications);radio frequency;stationary process;stationary state;transmitter	Maria Gregori;Miquel Payaró;Daniel Pérez Palomar	2016	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2016.2556658	mathematical optimization;transmitter;telecommunications;mathematics;energy harvesting;wireless	Mobile	36.68256355633206	90.86243609615555	148640

To avoid extensive information exchange with the access point in centralized approaches, we propose a distributed threshold-based scheme, where each user accesses multiple channels simultaneously based on a comparison between measured channel gains and a channel gain threshold. Each user will adapts its channel gain threshold based on local measurements of collision on each channeland the energy consumption for channel contention. The problem is formulated as a constrained non-cooperative game. We show existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium. A gradient-based algorithm is proposed to update the channel gain threshold. Furthermore, the convergence of this algorithm is proved. In addition, for heterogeneous systems, our proposed scheme can maintain multiuser diversity gains considering the time-varying channel gain and energy consumption. Compared with peer distributed OFDMA schemes and random channel selection algorithms, our proposed schemes reduce overhead and achieve a higher throughput.	algorithm;centralized computing;expectation–maximization algorithm;gradient;information exchange;iteration;iterative method;multi-user;nash equilibrium;overhead (computing);scheduling (computing);simulation;telecommunications link;throughput;wireless access point	Bo Yang;Yanyan Shen;Mikael Johansson;Xin-Ping Guan	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2010.5502753	game theory;throughput;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;wireless network;computer network	Mobile	32.803414748252194	94.0156664129605	149086
789bbd48ab6af0d02a6a7cf0249fad7fa11c637a	device-to-device communications enabled multicast scheduling with the multi-level codebook in mmwave small cells		To keep up with the rapid growth of mobile data, there are increasing interests to deploy small cells in millimeter wave (mmWave) bands to underlay the conventional homogeneous macrocell network as well as in exploiting device-to-device (D2D) communications to improve the efficiency of the multicast service that supports content-based mobile applications. To compensate for high propagation loss in the mmWave band, high-gain directional antennas have to be employed, while it is critical to optimize multicast service in order to improve the network performance. In this paper, we develop an efficient multicast scheduling scheme for small cells in the mmWave band, called MD2D, where both D2D communications in close proximity and multi-level antenna codebook are utilized. Specifically, a user partition and multicast path planning algorithm is proposed to partition the users in the multicast group into subsets and to determine the transmission node for each subset, so as to achieve optimal utilization of D2D communications and multi-level antenna codebook. Then a multicast scheduling algorithm schedules the transmission for each subset. Furthermore, in order to optimize the network performance, the optimal choice of user partition thresholds is analyzed. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the MD2D achieves the best performance, in terms of network throughput and energy efficiency, compared with other existing state-of-the-art schemes. MD2D improves the network throughput compared with the second-best scheme by about 27%.	algorithm;automated planning and scheduling;codebook;loss function;mobile app;motion planning;multicast;network performance;optimization problem;performance evaluation;schedule (computer science);scheduling (computing);software propagation;throughput;time complexity	Yong Niu;L.

59bec14d58aa81e529d961c6eaac6428f6bddbc9	an energy and cost aware framework for cell selection and energy cooperation in rural and remote femtocell networks		To extend cellular coverage in rural and remote regions, deployment of femtocells is the most promising solution. The unavailability of round the clock grid power can be compensated by the use of renewal energy sources such as wind and solar. Additionally, energy cooperation among femtocells can further reduce the overall need for grid energy thereby lowering the operators’ operational expenditure. In this paper, we consider a network of femtocells primarily powered by a hybrid (solar and grid) energy source, and provide an energy and cost aware framework for energy cooperation and cell selection. Our proposed framework not only considers the energy consumption at the femtocells but also the associated cost and losses due to energy storage and cooperation. Our results show that our proposed framework has the potential to simultaneously improve the performance of the network in terms of energy consumption and cost.	cell (microprocessor);digital subchannel;face animation parameter;quality of service;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;software deployment;unavailability	Rahul Thakur;Sudeepta Mishra;Chebiyyam Siva Ram Murthy	2017	IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking	10.1109/TGCN.2017.2736007	renewable energy;unavailability;computer network;operations management;energy consumption;operating expense;efficient energy use;cost efficiency;energy storage;femtocell;engineering	Mobile	25.31136244117703	92.66709890032861	149208
800dcb50bd8dd3b1135d7f4ad9b8c2ab8fbbf5da	spectrum allocation with asymmetric monopoly model for multibeam-based cognitive satellite networks		With the rapid development of modern satellite communications, broadband satellite services are experiencing a period of remarkable growth in both user population and available bandwidth. Efficient spectrum management is required in order to meet the ever-increasing demand for broadband spectrum. In this paper, a spectrum allocation scheme for cognitive satellite networks is proposed to improve spectrum efficiency by addressing the situation that scarce spectrum resource is under-utilized while the overall demands of cognitive satellite users are not satisfied. The proposed scheme is devised to optimize bandwidth efficiency by achieving the Bayesian equilibrium through spectrum competition among cognitive satellite users. Due to the scarcity of spectrum resource, satellite systems have to eliminate some of the cognitive users’ transmission information types in order to fulfill the spectrum needs of priority users. After declining one or several kinds of modulation modes, cognitive users can update their spectrum lists. With the increase in number of cognitive users and their corresponding transmission information types, the complexity of the optimization problem increases significantly and becomes a computation burden to cognitive satellite systems. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a simplified solution for spectrum resource optimization in a computation-efficient manner. Through rounds of eliminating operations, the satellite systems can identify the final Bayesian equilibrium as an optimal spectrum allocation strategy. We also provide proofs for the existence of Bayesian equilibrium. Numerical results are given to evaluate the performance of our proposed method from diverse perspectives.	bayesian network;cognition;communications satellite;computation;frequency allocation;mathematical optimization;modulation;monopoly;optimization problem;spectral efficiency	Feng Li;Xin Liu;Kwok-Yan Lam;Zhenyu Na;Jingyu Hua;Jian Wang;Li Wang	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2797278	spectrum management;communications satellite;resource management;computer network;frequency allocation;distributed computing;computer science;bandwidth (signal processing);spectral efficiency;optimization problem;population	Mobile	28.566868025711326	95.66457713014493	149530

However, cooperation also introduces additional reporting time corresponding to the number of cooperative secondary users (SUs), which may decrease the throughput of the CRN. In this paper, a problem of jointly optimizing the sensing time, sensing threshold and numbers of cooperative SUs for each channel in multi-channel CRN is formulated to maximize the average achievable throughput of CRN while guaranteeing the priority of the primary user (PU) and the spectrum opportunity for the SUs. Numerical results show that the redundant SUs involved in the spectrum sensing may reduce average throughput, and an improvement in the throughput of the CRN is achieved through the joint optimization.	cognitive radio;greedy algorithm;ibm systems network architecture;line search;mathematical optimization;multipath propagation;numerical analysis;throughput	Jin-Ling Xu;Ming Chen;Nan Wang	2013	2013 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing	10.1109/WCSP.2013.6677094	cognitive radio;telecommunications;engineering;computer security;computer network	Mobile	33.639929073508306	88.9398170021972	149726
6a8c2746d9152c97192351d82ed34b17c925e646	qoe-aware resource allocation for d2d communications in unlicensed spectrum		This paper studies the QoE-aware resource allocation for device-to-device communications in unlicensed spectrum (D2D-U), which can meet the explosively growing data traffic and provide higher user's satisfaction in 5G networks. Specifically, channel access and power allocation are jointly considered for the D2D-U system and an optimization problem is formulated with the objective of balancing the overall system throughput and fairness of D2D-U and WiFi for coexistence. In order to reduce the complexity, this problem is decomposed into two subproblems, accordingly, two algorithms are proposed which are QoE-aware power allocation algorithm and rate-based fair duty cycle algorithm (F-DCA). In the QoE-aware power allocation algorithm, we employ the difference convex (D.C.) method to transfer the non-convex problem into convex optimization, which can greatly reduce the complexity. In the F-DCA, we adopt an iteration method to allocate the appropriate time proportion for the D2D-U system adaptively according to the load of the WiFi network. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithms achieve better performance compared with the traditional methods.	algorithm;coexist (image);computation;convex optimization;data rate units;digital communications associates;duty cycle;fairness measure;iteration;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;simulation;throughput	Yu Jin;Shaoyi Xu	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC Workshops)	10.1109/ICCW.2018.8403523	convex optimization;duty cycle;computer science;throughput;spectrum management;resource management;real-time computing;resource allocation;optimization problem;communication channel	Robotics	30.71273219426562	92.56017228928323	149878

This paper presents a subchannel and power allocation protocol that maximizes the energy efficiency (EE) of transmissions from a cognitive base station operating in the TV white spaces. The system model conforms to the IEEE 802.22 standard, and the proposed two-step solution to the EE maximization problem satisfies users' minimum rate requirements and keeps the interference to the primary users in the neighboring areas below a specified threshold. The first step of the protocol is a near-optimal but low-complexity subchannel assignment. This is followed by an optimal power allocation procedure that is obtained by analyzing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. The computational complexity of the resulting resource allocation protocol is the same as that of the least complex resource allocation protocol for orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) downlinks in the literature. Simulation results show that our protocol achieves higher EE compared with a modified and improved version of the OFDMA protocol from the literature.	amplifier;binary logarithm;cognitive radio;computational complexity theory;constraint (mathematics);decibel;digital subchannel;expanded memory;expectation–maximization algorithm;frequency band;frequency divider;hp 48 series;interference (communication);karush–kuhn–tucker conditions;lagrange multiplier;like button;powerpc;requirement;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;singular value decomposition;throughput;tucker decomposition;white spaces (radio)	Kandasamy Illanko;Muhammad Ali Naeem;Alagan Anpalagan;Dimitrios Androutsos	2016	IEEE Systems Journal	10.1109/JSYST.2015.2393834	communications protocol;cognitive radio;electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;base station;resource management;computer network	Networks	33.44184689497582	91.07410666387372	149946

Closed-form expressions for the optimal powers at the Nash equilibrium are derived, and a unified formulation is proposed to allow a more elaborated power allocation method to be adopted, in which the terminals, using the synchronization-oriented approach, can revert to the data-detection optimal criterion after synchronization is over.	coexist (image);game theory;lock (computer science);mathematical optimization;nash equilibrium;telecommunications link;throughput;unified framework;utility	Giacomo Bacci;Marco Luise	2010	2010 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference GLOBECOM 2010	10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5684239	game theory;synchronization;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;distributed computing	Robotics	33.99862224954448	89.89686896330777	149971

A Service Level Agreement (SLA) between xDSL and the femtocell operator (mobile operator) to reserve some bandwidth for the upcoming femtocell calls can increase the satisfaction level for femtocell users. In this paper, we propose a SLA negotiation procedure for femtocell networks. The Bandwidth Broker controls the allocated bandwidth for femtocell users. Then, we propose the dynamically reserved bandwidth scheme to increase the femtocell user's satisfaction level.

However, the back-room dealing (i.e., the frauds of the untrustworthy auctioneer and the bid-rigging between the greedy bidders and the insincere auctioneer) poses serious security challenges, leading to failures of all existing secure auction designs in allocating spectrum bands. In this paper, we propose a secure combinatorial spectrum auction (SCSA) by utilizing homomorphic encryption to prevent the backroom dealing. The idea in SCSA is to incorporate cryptographic techniques into the spectrum auction to address the frauds and bid-rigging. It computes and reveals the results of spectrum auction while the actual bidding values of bidders are kept confidential. SCSA also provides a corresponding procedure in implementing the combinatorial spectrum auction under the interference constraints. We show that compared with existing secure spectrum auction designs against the untrustworthy auctioneer, SCSA is much more efficient in both communication and computational complexity; and compared with other spectrum auction designs with security consideration, SCSA can effectively thwart the back-room dealings due to the untrustworthy auctioneer without too much performance degradation.	computation;computational complexity theory;confidentiality;cryptography;elegant degradation;frequency allocation;greedy algorithm;homomorphic encryption;interference (communication);spectral efficiency;subnetwork;time complexity;white spaces (radio)	Miao Pan;Xiaoyan Zhu;Yuguang Fang	2012	Wireless Networks	10.1007/s11276-011-0390-3	cognitive radio;homomorphic encryption;computer science;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Security	35.19553267814975	95.84140567913082	150072

In general, an iterative algorithm is required to find a feasible power allocation for all the transmitters. We obtain simple sufficient conditions using existing bounds to test the convergence of an iterative power control algorithm in terms of the number of sub-carriers, channel gains and the target Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) of the users. We consider two cases: 1) where the channel conditions are deterministic. 2) where the conditions change randomly based on some probability distribution. For the first case, we derive a condition which results in a Pareto optimal solution. For the random channel condition case, we determine a condition which leads to a solution that converges in distribution. We show through numerical examples that the powers of the nodes converge when sufficient conditions are satisfied, and diverge when they are not satisfied. We also show that our conditions can be applied in power based admission control.	algorithm;centralized computing;control flow;converge;ibm tivoli storage productivity center;interference (communication);iterative method;numerical analysis;pareto efficiency;randomness;requirement;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;transmitter	R.

However, mainstream research in this field focuses on optimizing physical layer performance measures, with little consideration for application-specific and network-wide performance measures. In this paper, the problem of joint video encoding rate control, power control, relay selection and channel assignment is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear problem(MINLP), and a solution algorithm based on a combination of the branch and bound framework and convex relaxation techniques is then proposed. The proposed solution jointly allocates channel, power, video encoding rate, and relay nodes for secondary users to maximize the video quality under the constraints posed by delay-sensitive video applications. Performance evaluation results show that cognitive networks with cooperative relaying can provide considerably higher video quality (in terms of the average peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR)) than solutions that do not rely on cooperation or without dynamic spectrum allocation.	algorithm;branch and bound;buffalo airstation;cognitive network;cognitive radio;cooperative mimo;data compression;frequency allocation;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);linear programming relaxation;multi-user mimo;nonlinear system;peak signal-to-noise ratio;performance evaluation;quality of service;relay;streaming media	Zhangyu Guan;Lei Ding;Tommaso Melodia;Dongfeng Yuan	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/icc.2011.5962936	cognitive radio;real-time computing;integer programming;telecommunications;nonlinear programming;computer science;resource management;cooperative diversity;computer network	Mobile	32.23258255455266	91.69415278448172	150435
9958c84968a5317a9f84cd4ee120068a6d467b43	adaptive channel selection and slot length configuration in cognitive radio	cognitive radio;spectrum access;markov process	This paper investigates the channel selection and slot time configuration in a cognitive radio network with a number of potential channels. Each channel alternates between ON state i.e., the primary user is using the channel and OFF state i.e., the primary user does not use the channel, and the state evolution process is modeled as a continuous-time Markov process. The traffic parameters the transition rates of the Markov process also evolve with time, modeled as a discrete-time Markov process. A secondary user adopts a slotted structure with dynamic slot length. At each slot, the secondary user needs to determine which channel to sense and, if the channel is sensed idle, how long the slot length should be. Considering both the amount of data that the secondary user can transmit and the duration when the secondary user interferes with primary activities, a reward definition is given. Based on the reward definition, an adaptive channel selection and slot length configuration method is proposed, which includes a reward maximization procedure to maximize the achieved reward and an update procedure for the channel state belief vector and traffic parameter state belief vector. Numerical results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and features of the proposed method.

This paper proposes a novel coordinated random beamforming and user-scheduling strategy to improve the throughput of users served by the femtocell access point (FAP) while satisfying the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of users served by both MBS and FAP. The strategy, termed as QoS-aware coordinated scheduling (QACS), requires limited coordination between the MBS and FAP, i.e., only the indexes of the qualified beams are shared. Exact statistical analysis for the ergodic achievable rate of both FAP and MBS with the proposed strategy are presented. Scheduling fairness is also addressed for the proposed QACS.	beamforming;ergodicity;face animation parameter;fairness measure;low-power broadcasting;quality of service;requirement;scheduling (computing);throughput;wireless access point	Jun Zhu;Hong-Chuan Yang	2017	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2016.2628387	throughput;computer network;heterogeneous network;scheduling (computing);quality of service;computer science;femtocell;beamforming	Mobile	27.489493401547495	91.14617293239996	150745
aa8b2e52d3bc34adc299d36e23f4dbad5506fe8c	a distributed implementation of mobility load balancing with power control and cell reselection in 4g network		We consider a self-organizing network (SON) capability of mobility load balancing in a 4G network, which determines the transmission power level for individual base stations and cell reselection for individual mobile stations such that the network-wide load is minimized while satisfying the minimum signal-tonoise and interference ratio (SINR) requirement of individual users. Both centralized and distributed schemes are proposed. The centralized scheme is based on the greedy algorithm, serving as a performance bound to the distributed scheme. The distributed scheme is to solve the system-wide optimization problem in the flat network model, i.e. no central control node. Furthermore, it requires relatively low inter-cell exchange information among neighboring cells over an inter-cell channel, e.g. X2 interface in the LTE network. The proposed design objective is to minimize the number of mobile users that do not satisfy the specified average throughput, while distributing the user traffic load as uniformly as possible among the neighboring cells. Our simulation results for a uniform user distribution demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve up to almost 80% of a load balancing gain that has been achieved by a greedy algorithm in the centralized optimization.

This multidimensional optimization is an NP-hard problem. In this paper we propose a suboptimal solution to this multidimensional optimization problem, which is based on bargaining game theory. The paper proposes also traffic dependent utility functions which take into account the QoS requirements of the associated packet stream. The results obtained by computer simulations, show that the proposed RRM algorithm brings significant improvement in terms of average delay, system capacity and bit rate values, compared to solutions presented in the technical literature at the expense of an increased complexity.	algorithm;channel capacity;combinatorial optimization;computer simulation;game theory;mathematical optimization;np-hardness;network packet;optimization problem;quality of service;radio resource management;requirement;spectral efficiency	Mihály Varga;Diana Serban;Zsolt Alfred Polgar	2013	2013 36th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP)	10.1109/TSP.2013.6613931	game theory;mathematical optimization;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;computer network	EDA	28.081567836295136	93.3539541814456	151143

Secondly, we derive the average eavesdropping effect (AEE) based on the known distribution and arrangement of uplink path, and investigate the derived results and the different relay deployment plans. Taking into account various factors (fluctuation of user traffic, burden limitation of relay etc), we efficiently utilize the available resources to simulate the real scenarios to implement the accurate secrecy evaluations.

8674c9fea1518e856f1ed67a9e53bba738222b38	mimo radar waveform design with peak and sum power constraints	signal image and speech processing;quantum information technology spintronics	Optimal power allocation for multiple-input multiple-output radar waveform design subject to combined peak and sum power constraints using two different criteria is addressed in this paper. The first one is by maximizing the mutual information between the random target impulse response and the reflected waveforms, and the second one is by minimizing the mean square error in estimating the target impulse response. It is assumed that the radar transmitter has knowledge of the target’s second-order statistics. Conventionally, the power is allocated to transmit antennas based on the sum power constraint at the transmitter. However, the wide power variations across the transmit antenna pose a severe constraint on the dynamic range and peak power of the power amplifier at each antenna. In practice, each antenna has the same absolute peak power limitation. So it is desirable to consider the peak power constraint on the transmit antennas. A generalized constraint that jointly meets both the peak power constraint and the average sum power constraint to bound the dynamic range of the power amplifier at each transmit antenna is proposed recently. The optimal power allocation using the concept of waterfilling, based on the sum power constraint, is the special case of p = 1. The optimal solution for maximizing the mutual information and minimizing the mean square error is obtained through the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) approach, and the numerical solutions are found through a nested Newton-type algorithm. The simulation results show that the detection performance of the system with both sum and peak power constraints gives better detection performance than considering only the sum power constraint at low signal-to-noise ratio.	algorithm;audio power amplifier;dynamic range;karush–kuhn–tucker conditions;mimo;mean squared error;mutual information;newton;numerical analysis;radar;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;transmitter;tucker decomposition;waveform	Merline Arulraj;Thiruvengadam S.

We analyze a multi-disease extension of the standard Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic model when individuals in the network present different levels of susceptibility to the diseases. In this paper, we assume that a controlling agency has a finite budget to invest on different antidotes, each one of them targeting a disease, and need to find the optimal allocation of these antidotes throughout the nodes and layers in the network. We first show that controlling several diseases using shared (and finite) resources can be written as a collection of spectral conditions involving the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrices representing each one of the layers in the network. We then propose a convex framework to find the optimal budget allocation to fabricate and distribute different types of antidotes to simultaneously control several diseases. We illustrate our approaches with numerical simulations in synthetic networks.	adjacency matrix;computer simulation;convex optimization;geometric programming;layer (electronics);mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimization problem;software propagation;spectral method;synthetic intelligence	Ximing Chen;Victor M.

To investigate network resource allocation problem, firstly, a general system utility optimization framework is proposed for the design of coordinated beamforming and power splitting algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization theory. The randomness of channel conditions and energy arrivals are considered in the framework. Secondly, an online algorithm is designed to maximize the system utility subject to energy sustainable constraints at the RRUs, signal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR) and energy harvesting requirements of mobile devices. Specifically, there is no requirements of prior distribution knowledge about channel condition or energy arrival in the proposed online algorithm. Finally, performance analysis demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve close-to-optimal system utility. In addition, extensive simulation results are provided to validate the theoretical analysis and to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.	beamforming;c-ran;exponential hierarchy;interference (communication);lyapunov fractal;lyapunov optimization;mathematical optimization;mobile device;online algorithm;profiling (computer programming);radio access network;randomness;requirement;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation	Sun Mao;Supeng Leng;Jie Hu;Kun Yang	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2018.8422659	resource management;real-time computing;online algorithm;c-ran;cloud computing;radio access network;lyapunov optimization;computer science;resource allocation;communication channel	Mobile	30.92944147017986	91.30987760464116	151349

Sufficient frequency resource and appropriate interference coordination techniques are eagerly needed to accommodate the network requirements. In this paper, to deal with the inter-cell interference (ICIC) in the Macro base station (MBS)-Pico base station (PBS) scenario of LTE-A heterogeneous network (HetNet), a modified ICIC scheme with randomly occupying partial frequency band is proposed, which is developed from frequency division multiplexing (FDM) ICIC scheme. On the basis of that MBSs and PBSs mainly use the orthogonal frequency resources, let them could use each other's main frequency resources randomly with a certain probability, thus the frequency resources could be used more sufficiently at the cost of introducing some interferences. Furthermore, the optimized values of probabilities, with which MBSs and PBSs randomly occupy each other's frequency resources, are calculated to maximize the system average throughput. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme could obtain above 40% gain in terms of the average spectral efficiency, compared with the traditional FDM ICIC scheme.	compaq lte;data rate units;finite difference method;frequency band;frequency divider;interference (communication);internet of things;multiplexing;randomness;requirement;simulation;spectral efficiency;statistical interference;throughput	Man Chu;Guomei Zhang;Shihua Zhu;Guobing Li;Gangming Lv	2015	2015 International Conference on Identification, Information, and Knowledge in the Internet of Things (IIKI)	10.1109/IIKI.2015.40	throughput;simulation;time–frequency analysis;telecommunications;computer science;base station;interference;frequency-division multiplexing;computer network	HPC	26.865111558568763	89.47496317165994	151417
3f2e1de923942f16b4becba36fee88b9963e568d	high throughput and fair scheduling for multi-ap multiuser mimo in dense wireless networks		This paper considers the fair scheduling problem for dense wireless networks with access point cooperation and multiple-input-multiple-output MIMO links. The problem is to maximize the aggregate throughput subject to a fairness constraint that is general enough to capture many different fairness objectives. We formally specify a non-convex optimization problem that captures all aspects of the problem setting, and we propose two algorithms to approximate its solution. The first algorithm jointly optimizes the selection of user sets, MIMO precoders, and assignment of user sets to time slots. The second algorithm separately optimizes first user sets and MIMO precoders and second assignment of user sets to time slots. The first algorithm guarantees perfect fairness and produces a local optimum or a saddle point for aggregate throughput at a fairly high computational cost. The second algorithm also guarantees perfect fairness and produces optimal aggregate throughput for a given set of possibly non-optimal user sets while having lower computational complexity. The second algorithm also has a parameter that allows throughput and fairness to be traded off for situations where maximizing throughput is critical and approximate fairness is acceptable. Analyses are complemented by simulation results, which show that: 1 the first algorithm produces significantly higher aggregate throughput than known approaches with a running time that is practical for scenarios with up to 50 users and 2 the second algorithm produces aggregate throughput that is very close to existing heuristics while having significantly lower running time.	aggregate data;algorithmic efficiency;approximation algorithm;computation;computational complexity theory;convex optimization;expectation–maximization algorithm;fair-share scheduling;fairness measure;greedy algorithm;heuristic (computer science);integer programming;iterative method;local optimum;mimo-ofdm;mathematical optimization;multi-user mimo;optimization problem;scheduling (computing);simulation;stationary process;throughput;time complexity;weight function;wireless access point	Mengyao Ge;Douglas M.

An analytical SER expression for a D2D system using multicarrier bandlimited QAM is derived and then used in the resource allocation algorithm. We consider centralized resource allocation for the D2D system, given knowledge of the channel state information and the rate distortion information of the video streams, and propose an iterative algorithm for subcarrier assignment and power allocation. Bit-level simulations for different numbers of D2D pairs demonstrate a considerable improvement on user capacity and video peak signal-to-noise ratio by incorporating the proposed SER expression compared with the GA. By invoking the conditions under which the central limit theorem holds, and comparing these conditions with the number of interferers and the power ratio of the dominant interferer in the simulated D2D system, we also study why the GA for the interference degrades performance.	algorithm design;approximation;bandlimiting;centralized computing;channel state information;distortion;interference (communication);iterative method;peak signal-to-noise ratio;rate–distortion theory;simulation;software release life cycle;streaming media;subcarrier	Peizhi Wu;Pamela C.

With the explosive growth of mobile data traffic in future wireless networks, the improvement of SE is necessary and it has been the main target in the 3rd Generation Partner Project standard. Considering this, a small cell solution is put forward and widely regarded as a promising technique to enhance SE by deploying low power cells (micro/pico/femto cells) in macrocells. However, with this mechanism cell gains can be severely limited by high inter-cell interference due to the densely deployed small cells. To address this problem, we first browse the major interference management techniques such as interference cancellation, interference coordination, coordinated multipoint transmission and reception, and interference alignment. Then we analyze the challenges when processing interference in a small cell architecture, and we explore the corresponding solutions. Finally, we design a scheme for interference mitigation from both the signaling and data transmission point of views. For the former, power constraint is employed. For the latter, a joint cross-tier and intra-tier interference mitigation sub-scheme is utilized. With this method, cross-tier interference can be alleviated by hybrid spectrum sharing, while intra-tier interference is avoided with orthogonal spectrum allocation. Besides, two methods are employed for exchanging information required in interference mitigation: wireless broadcast channel and UE-assisted relay. Simulations show that our proposed scheme achieves considerable improvement in SE compared to traditional schemes.	browsing;cell (microprocessor);computer simulation;frequency allocation;interference (communication);mobile phone;multipoint ground;multitier architecture;relay;spectral efficiency	Heli Zhang;Shanzhi Chen;Xi Li;Hong Ji;Xiaojiang Du	2015	IEEE Wireless Communications	10.1109/MWC.2015.7096292	channel allocation schemes;interference;single antenna interference cancellation;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;resource management;zero-forcing precoding;interference;co-channel interference;signal-to-noise ratio;computer network	Mobile	28.040031275795553	88.85113260883385	152420
80a07a8290d6cadc14247c15a0e8f31ed3c00a8d	power control and resource allocation for multi-cell ofdm networks		In this paper, we consider the problem of minimizing the total transmit power with power control and resource allocation in OFDM networks where mutual interference exists among cells. The signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR) relation is interpreted by the load and power coupling model, where every resource is available for each user with a probability. These probability variables can be also named as load vector. To solve this problem, we develop one low-complexity distributed power control and resource allocation algorithm. Specially, each BS updates its load vector, power vector, rate vector information and broadcasts it to all other BSs. Having collected all the information, each BS calculates its own load vector, power vector and rate vector by solving a convex program and a linear program. Compared with the existing optimization algorithm, where each resource is allocated to at most one user in a period of time, our algorithm has lower computational complexity.

4b9c935e843b5435b43782bffeae7a15086dee9d	robust sum secrecy rate optimization for miso systems with device-to-device communication		This paper considers a cellular multiple-input single- output (MISO) system overheard by multiple eavesdroppers, in the presence of one pair of device- to-device (D2D) nodes working as an underlay to the cellular network. A novel eavesdropping scenario is studied in this paper, where the eavesdroppers intend to simultaneously overhear the cellular communication as well as the D2D communication. Assuming imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter, our goal is to design the input covariance matrix of confidential message such that the worst-case sum secrecy rate is maximized, while satisfying the quality of service (QoS) requirement in the D2D communication. Although this worst-case sum secrecy rate maximization (SSRM) problem is non-convex, we show that it can be handled by solving a sequence of semidefinite programming (SDP) problems. Moreover, we give complexity analysis of our proposed optimization method and prove that transmit beamforming is an optimal strategy for the confidential message transmission. Numerical results are presented to verify the efficacy of our proposed method.	analysis of algorithms;beamforming;best, worst and average case;channel state information;confidentiality;entropy maximization;mathematical optimization;mobile phone;quality of service;semidefinite programming;system analysis;transmitter	Weidong Mei;Zhi Chen;Jun Fang	2017	2017 IEEE 85th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2017.8108304	quality of service;secrecy;channel state information;computer network;covariance matrix;transmitter;computer science;semidefinite programming;beamforming;distributed computing;cellular network	Robotics	37.42254624293215	89.95273791189905	152859

When the used femtocells have a closed access, the macro users, who are indoors or near to the femtocells, are prone to a severe interference from the femto access points especially, in the case of the universal frequency reuse deployment. A power control is an effective way to improve the macro users’ geometry at the expense of a drop in the femto users’ geometry and capacity. The concept of a cognitive radio is proposed, as a novel approach, to mitigate the interference and improve the macro and femto users’ geometry. The system is designed, mathematically analyzed, and simulated considering that the femto users are secondary users for the macro users. The macro users and the femto users’ throughputs of the proposed system are estimated. Comparisons among the universal frequency reuse, the power control, and the suggested approach are held. The simulation results validate the efficiency of the proposed system. The average of femto users’ throughput in the proposed system is better than the corresponding one employing the universal frequency reuse or the power control, even if only 20 % of the subcarriers are available to be accessed by the femto users. Moreover, the macro users’ throughput in the proposed system is better than the corresponding one applying the universal frequency reuse or the power control, even if only 40 % of the subcarriers are available to be accessed by the macro users.	algorithm;cognitive radio;compaq lte;interference (communication);paywall;simulation;software deployment;subcarrier;throughput;wireless access point	Mohamed Shalaby;Mona Shokair;Yaser S.

In this paper, we aim to optimize the content delivery from the content provider (CP) to the subscribers via relays in between. Tandem queueing model is applied to model the content delivery process, based on which absorbing Markov chain is used to derive the quality of the content delivery service received by the subscribers. The validity of the proposed queuing model has been verified by our simulation results. Observing that the content provider always has dominant control on the content delivery process and is pursuing the maximum profit by strategically designing the “rights” and “obligation” items for the subscribers, contract theory is adopted to reach an economically optimal solution. The numerical results verify the effectiveness of the contract-theoretic approach in maximizing the content provider's profit, and the capability to ensure the satisfaction of the heterogeneous subscribers with different quality of service (QoS) requirements.	absorbing markov chain;digital distribution;mobile device;mobile social network;numerical analysis;publish–subscribe pattern;quality of service;queueing theory;relay;requirement;simulation;tandem computers	Yifan Li;Ping Wang;Dusit Niyato;Yang Zhang	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2014.6883728	real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Robotics	30.223669371430063	96.14446989179314	152881

In order to maximize the probability of target detection, it is necessary to allocate the available transmit power resources suitably. The optimal allocation requires calculating the probability of detection, which is a computationally complex task, so using the exact distribution is very difficult in a dynamic scenario. In order to alleviate this problem, we propose an approximate distribution that is computationally simpler. This approximation is compared with the exact distribution as well as other cost functions that depend on the distribution of the test statistic, including the Kullback-Leibler divergence. It is demonstrated that the approximate distribution works well in the power allocation problem for MIMO radar target detection.	approximation algorithm;computational complexity theory;kullback–leibler divergence;mimo;mathematical optimization;radar;transmitter	Tuomas Aittomäki;Sundeep Prabhakar Chepuri;Visa Koivunen	2018	2018 IEEE 10th Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop (SAM)	10.1109/SAM.2018.8448906	transmitter power output;statistical power;computer science;mathematical optimization;mimo;radar;divergence;test statistic;object detection;signal-to-noise ratio	Metrics	41.66634921896307	90.33192245774046	152949

In this paper, we propose a partial sounding resource reuse (PSRR) method which aims to seamlessly guarantee the quality of service (QoS) of mobile users by mitigating the pilot contamination as well as minimize the reduction in the number of serviced users. To this end, the PSRR divides each cell area into center and edge areas, and partially reuses sounding resources among users in neighboring edge areas. We use a Markov chain model to analyze the performance of the PSRR. Then we evaluate the accuracy of our analysis through simulations, and show that the PSRR considerably improves QoS performance over the conventional schemes.	automatic sounding;channel capacity;elegant degradation;fairness measure;mimo;markov chain;pilot ace;power supply rejection ratio;provisioning;quality of service;seamless3d;simulation	Taeseop Lee;Hyung-Sin Kim;Sangkyu Park;Saewoong Bahk	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2014.6883483	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer network	Embedded	27.361719753528302	89.7170488522044	152990

Our results show that when the steering vectors for all receivers are of Vandermonde type (such as in the case of a uniform linear array and line-of-sight propagation), a globally optimum solution to the corresponding transmit beamforming problem can be obtained via an equivalent SDP reformulation.

c1e0b3813c5f41d1c3ab24add5ead56d6765cdf5	popular matching games for correlation-aware resource allocation in the internet of things		In this paper, the problem of cell association is studied in an Internet of things (IoT) system in which a set of devices deployed in a given area report physical events to a set of small base stations (SBSs) via uplink communication links. In this model, the key goal is to minimize the number of devices that report the same information to a given SBS by taking into account the spatial correlation between the IoT devices. In particular, the problem of correlation-aware cell association is formulated as a popular matching game in which the IoT devices are assigned to the SBSs to maximize the amount of information that is reported to the SBSs. To this end, the number of devices matched to every SBS must be maximized. For the formulated problem, a distributed two- level matching algorithm is proposed and the algorithm is proved to converge to a popular outcome. In that state, all the SBSs and devices prefer the matching that results from the proposed algorithm to any other possible matching. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm allows the SBSs to collect up to 40\% more useful information compared to max sum-rate association algorithm.

Each user has a single antenna. Due to practical limitations, each antenna of the BS has an individual power constraint. Assume that only long-term channel state information (CSI) is available. The objective is to minimize the downlink transmission power under the users' signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints and the per-antenna power constraints. Mathematically, the objective is to find the optimal solution of a non-convex optimization problem. With dual decomposition, the problem is decomposed into two levels. For the lower level problem, we propose a novel iterative method based on the theory of matrix pencils. For the higher level problem, we propose a subgradient method and prove its convergence. Assembling all the computation methods, we obtain a beamforming and power control algorithm. At last, numerical results are provided to illustrate the performance of the algorithm.	algorithm;beamforming;channel state information;computation;convex optimization;interference (communication);iterative method;lagrangian relaxation;mathematical optimization;multi-user;numerical analysis;optimization problem;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;subgradient method;telecommunications link	Siduo Shen;Tat-Ming Lok	2014	2014 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2014.6952321	mathematical optimization;smart antenna;control theory;mathematics;sensor array	Mobile	36.69065468443952	90.36267571922116	153415

To maximize the total downlink throughput of all edge users, it is crucial to properly determine the set of simultaneously served users in each physical resource block (PRB) and the cooperative base stations (BSs) for each scheduled user, as well as the transmit power of the BSs. Based on the reference signal receiving power (RSRP) of each edge user, we first propose two simple and integrated transmission scheduling algorithms, one distributed and the other centralized, to choose cell-edge users and cooperative BSs in each PRB. With the scheduling results, the classic Water-Filling (WF) algorithm is carried out over all PRBs at each BS to get an initial single cell power allocation. To take the interference among different cooperative BS sets into account, we further formulate a non-cooperative power allocation game to adjust the initial power allocation for interference coordination, where the initial power allocation provides the strategy space of the game for each BS. This increases the total downlink throughput of edge users over all BSs. We prove that the game has a unique Nash Equilibrium (NE), and design an algorithm to find the NE. Performance gain is then demonstrated through extensive simulation studies.	algorithm;carpal tunnel syndrome;cell signaling;centralized computing;compaq lte;game theory;interference (communication);nash equilibrium;overhead (computing);scheduling (computing);simulation;space-filling tree;telecommunications link;throughput	Shu Fu;Bin Wu;Hong Wen;Pin-Han Ho;Gang Feng	2014	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2013.120113.121646	game theory;real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;interference	Mobile	31.387358982609275	92.51841014706987	153422

The objective is to maximize the number of admitted users subject to a signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio constraint at each admitted user and a transmit power constraint at each base station. We cast the admission control problem as an l0 minimization problem. This problem is known to be combinatorial, NP-hard. Hence, we have to rely on suboptimal algorithms to solve it. We approximate the l0 minimization problem via a non-combinatorial one. Then, we propose a distributed algorithm to solve the non-combinatorial problem. The proposed algorithm is derived by using alternating direction method of multipliers in conjunction with sequential convex programming. We show numerically that the proposed algorithm achieves a near-to-optimal performance.	approximation algorithm;augmented lagrangian method;convex optimization;distributed algorithm;interference (communication);np-hardness;numerical analysis;numerical integration;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;system analysis;telecommunications link	K.

Under such a background, this study addresses the stability related problem of the power control in multiple coexisting wireless networks. We develop an analytical framework that is capable of utilizing the small-gain theorem to show the considered power control is bounded-input bounded-output (BIBO) stable in the sense of the    $ {\mathscr {L}}_{2}$    gain if proper sufficient conditions are satisfied. Through modeling the power control as a feedback system and making use of the uncertainty representation, this framework can derive generalized results for the power-control algorithms that emerge in previous works. The framework developed in this study also admits the incorporation of multipath propagation that is a very common phenomenon in wireless communication systems. Within our derivation, making use of the theory for positive systems dramatically simplifies the analysis and leads to many refined results.

Under this model, we investigate the message-sharing transmission strategy where the CP shares each user's message with a fixed subset of BSs, which then serve the user through joint beamforming. In this setting, although the overall long-term average backhaul consumption is limited by the fixed cluster size, the instantaneous backhaul consumption at each BS may vary significantly depending on the data rates of the scheduled users at each time slot. To avoid such large fluctuations in backhaul consumption, this paper proposes a backhaul-aware multicell scheduling and beamforming strategy that explicitly accounts for backhaul consumption. Specifically, a beamforming design algorithm is proposed to maximize the network utility for a downlink C-RAN under both per-BS power constraints and per- BS backhaul constraints in each time slot. Although this problem has already been considered in our previous work, this present paper proposes a new beamforming design algorithm that not only has guaranteed convergence but also achieves better system performance. This paper also shows that the performance of the proposed algorithm can be further improved by iterating with an additional power minimization step.	algorithm;backhaul (telecommunications);beamforming;c-ran;central processing unit;cluster analysis;converge;entropy maximization;expectation–maximization algorithm;iteration;network utility;radio access network;scheduling (computing);simulation;stationary process;telecommunications link	Binbin Dai;Wei Yu	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)	10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247585	algorithm design;real-time computing;convergence;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;scheduling;computer network	Mobile	31.155141991015647	91.39875049326778	153960

The performance of such networks significantly depends on the configuration of the power profiles that implement the soft frequency reuse patterns. In this paper, we investigate the performance of static soft frequency reuse by comparing it against the optimal case, in which a central entity optimally distributes power among the users of the network. It is shown that there is a significant performance gap between both approaches, which needs to be filled by adaptive SFR mechanisms. Moreover, we show that the achievable gain of static SFR is small in a system that is able to optimally decide on terminal/sub-carrier assignments.

However, the works assume no common vulnerabilities among diverse variants, which is not always satisfied in the real world. In this letter, we consider that some variants have common vulnerabilities and propose the common vulnerability-aware diverse variant placement problem. We formulate the problem as an integer programming optimization problem with NP-hard complexity based on a new metric named the Infected Ratio Expectation. Furthermore, we devise algorithms to solve the problem for the static network and the network for extension. The simulation results show that compared with the baseline algorithms, our algorithms effectively restrain the worm spread by about 42%.	algorithm;baseline (configuration management);institute of radio engineers;integer programming;mathematical optimization;np-hardness;optimization problem;routing;simulation	Jianjian Ai;Zehua Guo;Hongchang Chen	2018	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2820072	real-time computing;computer science;heterogeneous network;integer programming;distributed computing;optimization problem	DB	35.31837038858961	96.06293585660252	154249

While their primary purpose has been to improve coverage in current solutions, their decreased cell sizes in turn also provide improved cell capacity through increased spatial reuse. The demand for bandwidth-intensive IP services will soon necessitate the need to tap into this improved capacity. However, the lack of direct coordination between the macro and femto cells, and the completely distributed nature of femto cells make this an extremely challenging task. In this work, we address this challenge by providing efficient resource management solutions for OFDMA-based femto cells along with performance guarantees. In the process, we consider two models that tradeoff performance and overhead. We also propose a novel location-based resource management solution for leveraging maximal spatial reuse from femto cells. Our comprehensive evaluations indicate that in addition to providing improved coverage indoors, with carefully designed resource management solutions that leverage spatial reuse, femto cells have a great potential to increase the system performance by two folds.	location-based service;maximal set;overhead (computing);spatial multiplexing	Karthikeyan Sundaresan;Sampath Rangarajan	2009		10.1145/1530748.1530754	real-time computing;cost-effectiveness analysis;computer science;resource management;operating system;wireless network;location;scheduling;femtocell;computer network	Mobile	26.537402219389563	90.30669775901625	154326

The ICI management control is adaptive to joint queue state information (QSI) over a slow time scale, while the user scheduling control is adaptive to both the joint QSI and the joint channel state information (CSI) over a faster time scale. We show that the problem can be modeled as an infinite horizon average cost Partially Observed Markov Decision Problem (POMDP), which is NP-hard in general. By exploiting special problem structure, we shall derive an equivalent Bellman equation to solve the POMDP problem. To address the distributive requirement and the issue of dimensionality and computation complexity, we derive a distributive online stochastic learning algorithm, which only requires local QSI and local CSI at each of the M BSs. We show that the proposed learning algorithm converges almost-surely and has significant gain compared with various baselines. The proposed solution only has linear complexity order O(MK).	algorithm;bellman equation;channel state information;computation;decision problem;ici (programming language);interference (communication);markov chain;np-hardness;partially observable markov decision process;queue (abstract data type);requirement;scheduling (computing);telecommunications link	Huang Huang;Vincent K.

We present the way that such metrics are used to maximize the total sum rate and the relations held among each other. Via simulation we found upper bounds of the average total sum rate for each metric which allow us to establish a benchmark in terms of sum rate performance and a trade-off between the metric accuracy needed to maximize the sum rate and the computational complexity required to determine each metric.	beamforming;benchmark (computing);computational complexity theory;expectation–maximization algorithm;multi-user;simulation;system analysis;utility	Eduardo D.

ff432e7827fd08fcb3e60ab789b1cc7be9466f17	wirelessly powered mobile computation offloading: energy savings maximization		Achieving long battery lives or even self sustainability has been a long standing challenge for designing mobile devices. This paper seamlessly integrates two promising energy-saving technologies, namely mobile computation offloading (MCO) and microwave power transfer (MPT), and proposes a novel design framework of wirelessly powered MCO. Consider a single-user system where a base station (BS) either transfers power to or offloads computation from a mobile. Two mobile operation modes, namely local computation and offloading, are optimized separately for maximizing the mobile energy savings. For local computation, the non-convex problem of optimizing the CPU- cycle frequencies under the deadline and energy causality constraints is solved via convex relaxation. The optimal CPU- cycle frequencies are shown to have different forms depending on the BS transmission power. For offloading, the time duration before the deadline is divided for separate MPT and offloading and the optimal division is derived in a closed form. By combining above results, the optimal offloading decision is analyzed with respect to the deadline, data-input size and BS transmission power and validated by simulation.	causality;computation offloading;convex optimization;expectation–maximization algorithm;information;instruction cycle;linear programming relaxation;microwave;mobile device;modern portfolio theory;multi-user;simulation	Changsheng You;Kaibin Huang	2014	2015 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7417552	embedded system;real-time computing;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;base station;operating system;small cell;computational model;wireless;computer network	EDA	30.672434929499065	90.92066069685602	154758
dca8c46e8b9c78ca5a5e2b547afeb91ae956b08f	an indirect reciprocity based incentive framework for cooperative spectrum sensing		To overcome the hidden terminal problem a secondary user (SU) may encounter, cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) is proposed and gained much attention in the last decades. However, due to the selfish nature, SUs may not cooperate unconditionally as most previous works have assumed. Therefore, how to stimulate SUs to play cooperatively is an important issue. In this paper, we propose a reputation-based CSS incentive framework, where the cooperation stimulation problem is modeled as an indirect reciprocity game. In the proposed game, SUs choose how to report their sensing results to the fusion center (FC) and gain reputations, based on which they can access a certain amount of vacant licensed channels in the future. For the proposed game, we derive theoretically the optimal action rule, according to which the SU will truthfully report its result when the estimated average energy is equal to or higher than the given threshold and vice versa. The decision accuracy of the FC thereby can be greatly improved. Moreover, we derive the condition under which the optimal action rule is evolutionarily stable. Finally, simulation results are shown to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.	cascading style sheets;reputation;simulation;superuser	Bin Chen;Biling Zhang;Jung-Lang Yu;Yan Chen;Zhu Han	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2017.7996606	hidden node problem;simulation;mathematical optimization;reciprocity (evolution);cognitive radio;real-time computing;computer science;versa;incentive;reputation;communication channel	Robotics	33.134940984123325	96.04109788718618	155283

In LTE, single carrier-frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) was accepted as the uplink access scheme due to its advantage of very low cubic metric (CM). For LTE-A wideband transmission, multicarrier access would be more effective than single carrier access to make use of multi-user diversity and can maintain the physical channel structure of LTE, where the control information is transmitted on the edges of each 20MHz. In this paper, we discuss the access schemes in bandwidth under 20MHz as well as over 20MHz. In the case of bandwidth under 20MHz, we propose the access schemes allowing discontinuous resource allocation to enhance average throughput while maintaining cell-edge user throughput, that is, DFT-spread-OFDM with spectrum division control (SDC) and adaptive selection of SC-FDMA and OFDM (SC+OFDM). The number of discontinuous spectrums is denoted as spectrum division (SD). For DFT-S-OFDM, we define a parameter max SD as the upper limit of SD. We evaluate our proposed schemes in bandwidth under 20MHz and find that SC+OFDM as well as SDC with common max SD or UE-specific max SD can improve average throughput while their cell-edge user throughput can approach that of SC-FDMA. In the case of bandwidth over 20MHz, we consider key factors to decide a feasible access scheme for aggregating several 20MHz-wide bands.	compaq lte;telecommunications link	Le Yu Liu;Takamichi Inoue;Kenji Koyanagi;Yoshikazu Kakura	2009	IEICE Transactions		orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;resource management	Crypto	27.977982363857766	89.62612914414012	155457
019a3f283cd8b9bd1276f67117e3cc33213c1766	optimum beamforming for mimo multicasting	signal image and speech processing;quantum information technology spintronics	This paper investigates the transmit (Tx) beamforming design to maximize the throughput of a multiple-input multiple-output multicast channel, where common information is sent from the base station to K users simultaneously. This so-called max-min fair beamforming problem is known to be NP-hard. When the base station is equipped with two Tx antennas, we prove that the original complex-valued beamforming problem can be transformed into a real-valued problem and the globally optimal solution can be found by exhausting at most C1 K + C2 K + C3 K hypothesis tests. Moreover, a prune and search algorithm (PASA) is proposed for searching the optimal beamformer with computational complexity O(K3) in the worst case. When the base station has more than two Tx antennas, we develop an efficient algorithm named iterative two-dimensional optimization which converts the original beamforming problem into a series of two-antenna subproblems by iterations and hence, the beamformer is improved using PASA iteratively. Simulations results are presented to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithms.	beamforming;best, worst and average case;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;iteration;mimo;mathematical optimization;max-min fairness;maxima and minima;multicast;prune and search;search algorithm;throughput	Baisheng Du;Yi Jiang;Xiaodong Xu;Xuchu Dai	2013	EURASIP J.

ESPAR antennas are novel adaptive array antennas and have only one active element to output signals and multiple parasitic elements with loaded variable reactors. The analysis shows that, besides direct-path environments, ESPAR antennas can also be controlled in multi-path environments by the conventional steepest gradient algorithm. In addition, some positive output SINR values are obtained due to the beamforming ability of ESPAR antennas.	algorithm;beamforming;cross-correlation;fractal antenna;gradient;hoc (programming language);profiling (computer programming);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio	Atsuya Ando	2002		10.1109/WCNC.2002.993333	wireless ad hoc network;geometrical optics;telecommunications	HCI	44.79184240356997	90.55654568834083	156113

For the latter one, successive interference cancellation (SIC) has emerged as an advanced PHY technique with the ability of decoding two or more overlapping signals and therefore allowing multiple concurrent transmissions. Effectively managing the transmission concurrency over the shared medium ensures good quality of transmission and therefore results in higher achievable transmission data rates. In this paper, we seek to understand the benefits of SIC and its interference management capabilities in a multi-rate multihop wireless network. To characterize the network performance under these characteristics, we follow a cross-layer design approach and formulate the joint routing and scheduling problem with rate control as a mixed integer linear program with the objective to maximize the minimum flow throughput. Given its large scale and combinatorial complexity, we follow a decomposition approach using column generation to solve the problem. However, the complexity of solving exactly the pricing subproblem limits the application of the model to very small size network instances. We develop one efficient greedy method for solving exactly the pricing subproblem as well as a simulated annealing based heuristic approach with very good performance. Our results indicate that SIC benefits strongly depend on the strength of the received signals. We show that transmission links with fixed higher data rates do not necessarily yield higher SIC gains because higher transmission rates result in sparser network topologies and thus less flexible routing. Larger networks with SIC capabilities and bitrate adaptation however are most effective in controlling the interference and improving the spatial reuse and thus reap the largest benefits with gains exceeding 20% over networks only with SIC capabilities or only with rate control.	bell laboratories layered space-time;channel capacity;column generation;concurrency (computer science);end-to-end principle;greedy algorithm;heuristic;hop;interference (communication);linear programming;mathematical optimization;network performance;network topology;phy (chip);routing;scheduling (computing);simplified instructional computer;simulated annealing;throughput	Long Qu;Jiaming He;Chadi M.

This reflects the recognition in the important scaling advantages that the service providers can benefit from by increasing the autonomy of mobiles in decision making. This may however result in inefficiencies that are inherent to equilibria in non-cooperative games. Due to the concern for efficiency, centralized protocols keep being considered and compared to decentralized ones. From the point of view of the network architecture, this implies the co-existence of network-centric and terminal centric radio resource management schemes. Instead of taking part within the debate among the supporters of each solution, we propose in this paper hybrid schemes where the wireless users are assisted in their decisions by the network that broadcasts aggregated load information. We derive the utilities related to the Quality of Service (QoS) perceived by the users and develop a Bayesian framework to obtain the equilibria. Numerical results illustrate the advantages of using our hybrid game framework in an association problem in a network composed of HSDPA and 3G LTE systems.	centralized computing;compaq lte;image scaling;network architecture;point of view (computer hardware company);quality of service;radio resource management	Salah-Eddine Elayoubi;Eitan Altman;Majed Haddad;Zwi Altman	2010	2010 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM	10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462204	game theory;simulation;heterogeneous network;computer science;resource management;wireless network;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	29.63068582080529	95.36462297601969	156378

We propose a computationally efficient method for calculating the Pareto boundary of the rate region. We show that the problem of finding an arbitrary Pareto-optimal rate pair, along with its enabling beamforming vector pair, can be cast as a sequence of second-order cone programming (SOCP) feasibility problems. The SOCP problems are convex and they are solved very efficiently using standard off-the-shelf (namely, interior-point) algorithms. The number of SOCP problems that must be solved, for the computation of a Pareto-optimal point, grows only logarithmically with the desired accuracy of the solution.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;beamforming;channel state information;computation;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;pareto efficiency;second-order cone programming;system analysis;transmitter;utility functions on indivisible goods	Eleftherios Karipidis;Erik G.

Cooperative diversity enables to increase link capacity and signal to noise ratio. This paper presents source and relay base station's optimal power allocation in order to maximize the sum capacity over all relayed links. Average power allocation is solved by an iterative method which allocates relay and source powers separately, by convex optimization. Then source symbol powers are set with simple water-filling, in order to maximize the capacity. Simulation results show that sum capacity is highly increased by relaying under optimal power values. Relaying is especially efficient for user terminals who would have poor radio conditions without relaying. The paper also presents a simple method, based on path loss characterization, to determine the need for relaying. It can be used independently in the source base stations, which is particularly adapted for flat architectures.	convex optimization;iteration;iterative method;mathematical optimization;radio resource management;relay;scheduling (computing);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;telecommunications link	Mylene Pischella;Jean-Claude Belfiore	2007	2007 IEEE 65th Vehicular Technology Conference - VTC2007-Spring	10.1109/VETECS.2007.588	convex optimization;telecommunications;information theory;computer science;mathematics;iterative method;statistics;computer network	Mobile	35.36200424385215	88.73452143740306	156533

In the investigated scenario, D2D links, cellular uplinks and cellular downlinks are permitted to reuse the same spectrum resources under efficient interference control, leading to a more complicated interference relationship among the communications links when maximizing the network throughput via resource sharing. Therefore, we employ an interference graph to model the considered interference scenario, in which different communication links and the interference relationships among them are represented by the vertices and edges in the constructed interference graph, respectively. Then, we further propose a graph coloring based resource allocation scheme which can effectively allocate the spectrum resources to the communication links in order to maximize the network throughput with low computational complexity. Simulation results show that when allowing for the resource sharing among D2D links, cellular uplinks, and cellular downlinks, the network throughput can be effectively improved and our proposed scheme can solve this complicated resource sharing problem with low complexity and efficient resource allocation solutions.	algorithm;assignment problem;computational complexity theory;duplex (telecommunications);graph coloring;interference (communication);network performance;open research;simulation;throughput	Tinghan Yang;Rongqing Zhang;Xiang Cheng;Liuqing Yang	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Communication Systems	10.1109/ICCS.2014.7024757	telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;resource management;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	29.282916366978416	90.82340378389809	156570

In this context, we formulate the problem of designing the equilibrium sensing time in a distributed manner, in order to maximize the throughput of CR users while guarantying a good protection to the primary users (PU). Next, we study the Nash equilibrium of the system, we also propose a combined learning algorithm for continuous actions that is fully distributed, and allows to the CR users to learn their equilibrium payoffs and their equilibrium sensing time. The simulation results show that the system can learn the sensing time and converge to a unique Nash equilibrium, which come to prove the theoretical study. A surprising feature is that there exists a correlation between the transmit probability and the sensing time. More precisely, lower transmit probability induces lower sensing times.	algorithm;cognitive radio;concave function;converge;cyclic redundancy check;francis;ibm systems network architecture;ieee systems, man, and cybernetics society;international standard book number;nash equilibrium;simulation;throughput	Sofia Bouferda;Essaid Sabir;Aawatif Hayar;Mounir Rifi	2013		10.1145/2507924.2507944	simulation;telecommunications;artificial intelligence;nash equilibrium	Mobile	32.54424303963496	95.23787401144861	156610
d7e4da94562d01a320c60fbc9ad63664499007d3	transmitting and sharing: a truthful double auction for cognitive radio networks		The scarcity of spectrum channels resides in the limited bandwidth resource and the exploding demand from spectrum-based services and devices. To help ease this scarcity, the concept of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) is proposed, where licensed spectrum holders (primary users) may lease their channels to unlicensed users (secondary users). Many CRN auctions are thus designed to incentivize primary users (PUs) to share their idle channels with secondary users (SUs). Most of these auctions assume that a transmitting PU does not lease its channel to SUs; if it leases its channel to SUs, it does not transmit itself. To further utilize the resource, researchers have studied the scenario where a transmitting PU is allowed to lease its channels to SUs if the transmissions of the SUs do not undermine the transmission of the PU. However, the study assumes that there is only one PU who owns the licensed channels, whereas in practice, channels may be contributed by multiple PUs. This prevents the result of the study from being directly applied to the multi-PU scenario, as the potential competitions among the PUs are neglected. We extend the scenario to the CRN with multiple PUs and propose TDSA-PS as a Truthful Double Spectrum Auction with transmitting Primary users Sharing. We prove that TDSA-PS is truthful, individually rational, budget-balanced, and computationally efficient.	algorithmic efficiency;cognitive radio;ibm systems network architecture;one-class classification;ps-algol;transmitter	Xiang Zhang;Dejun Yang;Guoliang Xue;Ruozhou Yu;Jian Tang	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2018.8422505	scarcity;computer network;common value auction;resource management;cognitive radio;spectrum auction;double auction;computer science;idle;communication channel	Mobile	32.50628161987448	95.6191303979192	156666

The resource allocation in an OFDMA system is normally modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem involving a nonlinear objective with nonlinear constraints. This leads to high computation complexity that is only solvable online. In this paper we first develop a nonlinear optimization model of OFDMA resource allocation that incorporates not only the throughput constraint but also the delay constraint. We then find an equivalent linear formulation to this optimization problem to facilitate analysis. Moreover, we develop a heuristic approximation algorithm to provide a close solution to the equivalent linear programming problem. The heuristic algorithm is efficient enough for on-line adaptive resource allocation. Simulation results show that the heuristic solution can achieve almost same capacity but with less computation complexity.	approximation algorithm;combinatorial optimization;computation;computational complexity theory;decision problem;frequency divider;linear programming;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;online and offline;optimization problem;simulation;spectral efficiency;subcarrier;throughput;time complexity	Seyed Mohamad Alavi;Chi Zhou;Yu Cheng	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2009.5199154	mathematical optimization;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;computer science;linear programming;theoretical computer science;distributed computing	Embedded	33.11041524681434	91.54029226246186	156706
c69e8bb2e9ce5cbb835b4d34a1ca60ccb5d2db6c	application of non-orthogonal multiplexing to mmwave multi-user systems		Limited wireless spectrum in future networks is an issue that millimeter-Wave (mmWave) frequencies can resolve. Beamforming is a challenging operation for mmWave systems. Both analogue and hybrid solutions have been proposed. Apart from Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA) systems, the Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) scheme has been recently considered as an alternative and can outperform OMA in many cases. Our contribution is the application of NOMA to a hybrid precoder design in mmWave indoor scenarios with multiple users. Introducing to our system appropriate user grouping and scheduling schemes, we show that the NOMA outperforms, in terms of spectral efficiency, OMA by providing a 17.1% improvement for high SNR values. Finally, applying NOMA with fair power allocation improves the rate of users with weak channel conditions by around 1 bps/Hz for SNR>5dB, without degrading the overall spectral efficiency in the cell.	algorithm;beamforming;multi-user;multiplexing;oma;scheduling (computing);signal-to-noise ratio;spectral efficiency;xslt/muenchian grouping	Wenfang Yuan;Vaia Kalokidou;Simon Armour;Angela Doufexi;Mark A.

We describe state-of-the-art, research challenges involved, and a novel random neural network (RNN) based power controller and interference management framework. The RNN based cognitive engine (CE) learns how the electromagnetic environment is affecting the reliability of communication and can therefore dynamically selects the optimal transmit power for serving users and the users' served by neighbouring cells. The presented CE model has features such as better generalization, fast calculation in run-time, and easy hardware/software implementation. These three features are essential for the development of any real-time cognitive communication system and most of the existing artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) based solutions lack them. To achieve the best learning capability, performance evaluation of four learning algorithms (gradient descent (GD), adaptive inertia weight particle swarm optimization (AIW-PSO), differential evolution (DE), and genetic algorithm (GA)) are applied to RNN and analysed. The analysis showed that AIW-PSO outperformed all other algorithms in terms of both learning and prediction accuracy but with slight compromise on computational complexity and training speed as compared to GD, whereas DE and GA had low performance. Therefore, AIW-PSO based RNN framework is the optimal choice for presented system model.	all-in-wonder;artificial intelligence;artificial neural network;catastrophic interference;cognitive network;compaq lte;computational complexity theory;differential evolution;electromagnetic environment;gd-rom;genetic algorithm;gradient descent;interference (communication);machine learning;mathematical optimization;particle swarm optimization;performance evaluation;programming paradigm;random neural network;real-time clock;requirement;software release life cycle;telecommunications link;throughput	Ahsan Adeel;Hadi Larijani;Abbas Javed;Ali Ahmadinia	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)	10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247202	simulation;genetic algorithm;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematical model;interference;accuracy and precision;statistics	Robotics	25.542435975580943	95.18911411164244	157055

The optimal subcarrier and bit allocation problems, which are previously formulated as nonlinear optimizations, are reformulated into and solved by integer programming (IP). A suboptimal approach that performs subcarrier allocation and bit loading separately is proposed. It is shown that the subcarrier allocation in this approach can be optimized by the linear-programming (LP) relaxation of IP, while the bit loading can be performed in a manner similar to a single-user OFDM. In addition, a heuristic method for solving the LP problem is presented.

Each application running on the user equipment (UE) is assigned an application utility function. In the proposed model, different classes of user groups are consid ered and users are partitioned into different groups based on the carriers coverage area. Each user has a minimum required application rate based on its class and the type of its applic ation. Our objective is to allocate multiple carriers resources optimally among users, that belong to different classes, located with n the carriers’ coverage area. We use a utility proportional fairness approach in the utility percentage of the application running on the UE. Each user is guaranteed a minimum quality of service (QoS) with a priority criterion that is based on user’s class and the type of application running on the UE. In addition, we prove the existence of optimal solutions for the proposed resource allocation optimization problem and present a mul ticarrier resource allocation with user discrimination algorithm.

6b8de75b7a34f7bc1e07b0991cceda7cf3ce52e0	decentralized transmission policies for energy harvesting devices		The problem of finding decentralized transmission policies in a wireless communication network with energy harvesting constraints is formulated and solved using the decentralized Markov decision process framework. The proposed policy defines the transmission strategies of all devices so as to correctly balance the collision probabilities with the energy constraints. After an initial coordination phase, in which the network parameters are initialized for all devices, every node proceeds in a fully decentralized fashion. We numerically show that, unlike in the case without energy constraints where a fully orthogonal scheme can be shown to be optimal, in the presence of energy harvesting this is no longer the best choice, and the optimal strategy lies between an orthogonal and a completely symmetric system.	computation;markov chain;markov decision process;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;telecommunications network;time complexity	Alessandro Biason;Subhrakanti Dey;Michele Zorzi	2017	2017 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference Workshops (WCNCW)	10.1109/WCNCW.2017.7919068	mathematical optimization;simulation	Embedded	31.94990505082406	96.29888634694377	157332

Data symbols transmitted from base station (BS) to mobile stations (MSs) are drawn from discrete finite alphabets, such as M-QAM constellations. Transmitter-based precoding is introduced so as to allow simple despreading followed by single-user detection at MSs. A power-efficient non-linear precoding optimization problem is formulated by imposing minimum Symbol Error Probability (SEP) targets at MSs. We first elaborate on how to translate the SEP targets into exact constraint regions on noiseless received components at MSs. With relaxation on the exact regions, a tractable convex problem is obtained. A dual-decomposition-based algorithm is then developed to accommodate parallel processors to perform precoding calculation. The signature sparsity turns out to be vital to reduce interprocessor communication overhead and computational complexity for pre-coding. The scheme proposed offers considerable transmit power reduction compared with the conventional zero-forcing precoder.	algorithm;central processing unit;centralized computing;cobham's thesis;computation;computational complexity theory;convex optimization;inter-process communication;lagrangian relaxation;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;multi-user;nonlinear system;optimization problem;overhead (computing);parallel computing;sparse matrix;symantec endpoint protection;telecommunications link;transmitter;type signature;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding	Min Li;Stephen V.

An Orthogonal Resource Allocation Algorithm (ORAA) has been proposed in [1]. After analyzing the co-channel interference and SINR of the ORAA, we propose a modified ORAA to improve the spectrum efficiency. Based on this scheme, co-channel interference and SINR are analyzed compared to the ORAA. In the theory analysis, a key design parameter is found and its optimal value is selected through the simulations. Intensive system-level simulation demonstrated the performance of the modified ORAA is superior to the ORAA remarkably.	algorithm;duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);optimization problem;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;spectral efficiency;system-level simulation;telecommunications link	Min Liang;Yafeng Wang;Fan Huang;Dacheng Yang	2009		10.1145/1582379.1582660	spectrum;cellular network;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;co-channel interference;computer network	Metrics	28.917453504951705	90.75756794528122	159070

We consider a two-tier network where a small cell network offers offloading services to a macro network to improve its quality of service. In return, the small cells are rewarded for their cooperation with a number of licenses to operate in the spectrum owned by the macro network. The short link distances and diversity offered by the small cell network to offload the macro user help enhance the total spectral and energy utilization of the network. For effective functioning of the scheme, it is important to determine the division between the fraction of small cells that provide offloading services and those which obtain the licenses. In this paper, we present a comprehensive mathematical model of this LSA-based offloading and evaluate the optimal division between the offloading and licensing small cells. Our analysis shows that such spectrum sharing can lead to commendable gains in the spectral utilization of the network while assuring the desired quality of service for both macro and small network. An intelligent determination of the fraction of offloading small cell network results in efficient energy use for offloading. We test our scheme within the network parameters of the city of Leeds, U.K. Our results indicate that the spectral utility of Leeds can be improved by more than 12×, and the energy efficiency by 16× through our proposed scheme.	mathematical model;multitier architecture;population;quality of service;url shortening	Maryam Hafeez;Jaafar M.

The mechanism can reflect the real game relationship among users, thus simplifying the complexity of the game. Meanwhile, a dynamic spectrum access algorithm with smaller complexity and corresponding dynamic equation are designed for the mechanism, converging to Nash equilibrium with faster speed and obtaining higher system throughput. At Nash equilibrium, the reward of individual user is identical on each channel. Theory analyzes and proves that the dynamic equation is globally asymptotically stable, which illustrates that when user deviates because of bounded rationality, it is still able to converge again with faster speed and guarantee better performance with less deviation, and user's deviation only affects its neighboring users, not spreading to the whole network. Simulation comparison verifies the superiority above.

Most existing interference management approaches, such as coordinated beamforming and joint transmission, require joint signal processing at a number of, if not all, BSs. The burden thus imposed on the backhaul network may be too heavy for practical systems. In this paper, we therefore propose a low-complexity inter-cell interference cancellation (ICIC) scheme, where each BS independently cancels its interference to a set of users in neighboring cells when transmitting to its own user. In particularly, the proposed ICIC scheme is implemented in two time-scales. In the slow time-scale, each BS is assigned to a set of users intended for ICIC, referred to as a nulling set, according to long-term statistics of the wireless channels. Then, in the fast time-scale, beamforming vectors are chosen at each BS to cancel its interference to the users in its nulling set based on the instantaneous channel state information (CSI). In this way, the overall system throughput is improved through slow adaptive assignment of nulling sets, while real-time signal processing is implemented locally at each BS. To assign nulling sets for BSs, we should carefully examine the trade-off between the gain from ICIC and the loss in the transmission diversity, such that the benefits of multiple antennas at BSs are exploited efficiently. To this end, we formulate the problem of finding the optimal assignment of nulling sets as an integer programming (IP), where the data rate is expressed as a function of the nulling set assignment. With the derived expression of the data rate, we develop a greedy algorithm to solve the IP efficiently. Simulation in a two-tier network shows that the proposed ICIC scheme can balance the data rates in pico and macro cells adaptively such that the total throughput is improved.	backhaul (telecommunications);beamforming;cell (microprocessor);channel state information;coexist (image);data rate units;greedy algorithm;integer programming;interference (communication);multitier architecture;real-time clock;signal processing;simulation;telecommunications link;throughput;transmitter;uncompressed video;unix signal	Yingxiao Zhang;Ying Jun Angela Zhang	2015	2015 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)	10.1109/ICCChina.2015.7448679	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;zero-forcing precoding;computer network	Mobile	31.628309880520305	91.15996268541836	159435

Here, base stations in neighboring cells (partially) coordinate their transmission schedules in an attempt to avoid simultaneous max-power transmission to their mutual cell edge. Limits on communication overhead and use of the backhaul require base station coordination to occur at a slower timescale than the customer arrival process. The central challenge is to properly structure coordination decisions at the slow timescale, as these subsequently restrict the actions of each base station until the next coordination period. Moreover, because coordination occurs at the slower timescale, the statistics of the arriving customers, e.g., the load, are typically only approximately known--thus, this coordination must be done with only approximate knowledge of statistics. We show that performance of existing approaches that assume exact knowledge of these statistics can degrade rapidly as the uncertainty in the arrival process increases. We show that a two-stage robust optimization framework is a natural way to model two-timescale decision problems. We provide tractable formulations for the base-station coordination problem and show that our formulation is robust to fluctuations (uncertainties) in the arriving load. This tolerance to load fluctuation also serves to reduce the need for frequent reoptimization across base stations, thus helping minimize the communication overhead required for system-level interference reduction. Our robust optimization formulations are flexible, allowing us to control the conservatism of the solution. Our simulations show that we can build in robustness without significant degradation of nominal performance.	approximation algorithm;backhaul (telecommunications);cobham's thesis;decision problem;elegant degradation;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;overhead (computing);program optimization;quantum fluctuation;robust optimization;robustness (computer science);simulation;software performance testing;statistical interference	Sungho Yun;Constantine Caramanis	2012	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking	10.1109/TNET.2012.2185508	stochastic process;real-time computing;simulation;computer science;base station;statistics	Metrics	31.10091020441291	88.70200420901779	159514

The system adopts a hybrid-automatic-repeat-request of type I (HARQ-I) protocol, and each user has an average delay constraint to be satisfied under a total power constraint for the system. The contribution of this paper lies in several folds. 1) By introducing new constraints and new variables in the original problem, the solution is analytically obtained by the dual method. 2) An algorithm that jointly allocates for every user the optimal downlink power at base station and relay station (RS) and selects the RS (if cooperation is decided) is proposed. 3) Another binary integer programming algorithm that selects the optimal modulation and coding scheme (MCS) and optimizes the number of time-frequency resource blocks (RBs) between users is proposed. In order to corroborate our findings, simulation results in terms of energy-delay tradeoff, average starvation user rates, and selected MCS statistics are presented. Our analyses show that relay-assisted strategy improves up to 30% the energy consumption, compared to a nonrelay-assisted one.	algorithm;broadcast relay station;energy minimization;hybrid automatic repeat request;integer programming;linear programming;modulation;multi-user;reed–solomon error correction;simulation;telecommunications link	Mohamad Maaz;Philippe Mary;Maryline Hélard	2017	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2017.2654684	hybrid automatic repeat request;modulation;real-time computing;energy consumption;convex optimization;quality of service;integer programming;computer science;telecommunications link;mathematical optimization;cellular network	Mobile	32.058614819390684	91.16432558037603	159538

Although the MRC-enabled WPT (MRC-WPT) with a single pair of transmitter and receiver has been thoroughly studied in the literature, there is limited work on the general setup with multiple transmitters and/or receivers. In this paper, we consider a point-to-multipoint MRC-WPT system with one transmitter delivering wireless power to a set of distributed receivers. We aim to introduce new applications of signal processing and optimization techniques to the performance characterization and optimization in multiuser WPT via MRC. We first derive closed-form expressions for the power drawn from the energy source at the transmitter and that delivered to the load at each receiver. We identify a “near-far” fairness issue in multiuser power transmission due to receivers' distance-dependent mutual inductance with the transmitter. To tackle this issue, we propose a centralized charging control algorithm to jointly optimize the receivers' load resistance to minimize the total transmitter power drawn while meeting the given power requirement of each individual load. For ease of practical implementation, we also devise a distributed algorithm for the receivers to adjust their load resistance independently in an iterative manner. Last, we characterize the power region that constitutes all the achievable power-tuples of the loads via controlling their adjustable resistance. In particular, we compare the power regions without versus with the time sharing of users' power transmission, where it is shown that time sharing yields a larger power region in general.

Here, we consider a general antenna deployment method for wireless networks, termed multi-antenna C-RAN, where a flexible number of antennas can be equipped at each RRH to more effectively balance the performance and fronthaul complexity tradeoff beyond the conventional massive MIMO and single-antenna C-RAN. To coordinate and control the fronthaul traffic over multi-antenna RRHs, under the uplink communication setup, we propose a new “spatial-compression-and-forward (SCF)” scheme, where each RRH first performs a linear spatial filtering to denoise and maximally compress its received signals from multiple users to a reduced number of dimensions, then conducts uniform scalar quantization over each of the resulting dimensions in parallel, and finally sends the total quantized bits via a finite-rate fronthaul link to the baseband unit (BBU) for joint information decoding. Under this scheme, we maximize the minimum SINR of all users at the BBU by a joint resource allocation over the wireless transmission and fronthaul links. Specifically, each RRH determines its own spatial filtering solution in a distributed manner to reduce the signaling overhead with the BBU, while the BBU jointly optimizes the users' transmit power, the RRHs' fronthaul bits allocation, and the BBU's receive beamforming with fixed spatial filters at individual RRHs. Numerical results show that, given a total number of antennas to be deployed, multi-antenna C-RAN with the proposed SCF and joint optimization significantly outperforms both massive MIMO and single-antenna C-RAN under practical fronthaul capacity constraints.	baseband;beamforming;c-ran;data compression;mimo;mathematical optimization;multi-user;noise reduction;overhead (computing);quantization (signal processing);radio access network;remote radio head;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;software deployment;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link	Liang Liu;Rui Zhang	2015	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2015.2450199	multi-user mimo;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;antenna;mathematics;signal-to-noise ratio;wireless;statistics;computer network;mimo	Mobile	31.75428112015717	90.7207628369731	160113

In a D2D underlaying cellular system, through carefully coordinated dynamic scheduling, some base stations can be shut down and the corresponding load can be transferred to the D2D communication, which provides significant energy savings without much impact on the overall system performance. In this paper, we study the base station scheduling in D2D communication given a large scale of users. By formulating this problem into a flow maximization problem that optimizes the data transmission from the base stations to the users, we obtain the optimal base station scheduling solution. Through extensive simulations with real human mobility traces, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme, which significantly enhances the system throughput compared with existing strategies.	channel capacity;digital distribution;download;emergence;expectation–maximization algorithm;fairness measure;human-based computation;mobile phone;next-generation network;polynomial-time approximation scheme;quality of service;relay;scheduling (computing);simulation;software deployment;spectral efficiency;synthetic intelligence;system information (windows);throughput;tracing (software)	Yong Li;Depeng Jin;Pan Hui;Zhu Han	2016	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2015.2452415	cellular network;real-time computing;mobile telephony;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;radio resource management;base station;resource management;operating system;interference;computer network	Mobile	29.55137035027596	91.85140450687709	160214

f66d8fb6d1187f6d88eb40708c8e92a313c4ae0f	a machine learning algorithm for unlicensed lte and wifi spectrum sharing		Shared use of unlicensed spectrum in practice for coexistence with WiFi is rather complex and to achieve optimum usage can be highly challenging. While maximal utilization is desirable for unlicensed LTE, it is essentially important not to disturb WiFi activity in the unlicensed channel when designing a coexistence scheme. Opportunistic exploitation of idle gaps, or white spaces, in the WiFi channel for unlicensed LTE transmissions enables achieving the above objectives. However, complex analytical approaches to the opportunistic coexistence problem require considerable computation and might result in excessive latency, which would be undesirable. Machine learning schemes may reduce the computational complexity and hence not only reduce the latency but also help with energy consumption in wireless communications systems.We propose a novel algorithm based on reinforcement learning technique for the problem of opportunistic coexistence of unlicensed LTE and WiFi. The proposed approach in particular is based on Q-Learning, which provides a robust and model-free decision-making framework that enables online and distributive coexistence of small cells with WiFi. Our approach takes into account the latency imposed on WiFi activity by employing carrier sensing at the base station, and aims to minimize it, while maximizing unlicensed LTE utilization of the idle spectral resources.

This paper proposes a two-stage power allocation scheme in LTE air interface virtualization where radio resources are coordinated by a hypervisor among different virtual operators (VOs). In the first stage, VCG auction game is utilized to generate an initial allocation. In the game, VOs are modeled as bidders bidding for power resources on behalf of their users while hypervisor is modeled as the auctioneer. In the second stage, Shapley value in coalition game is introduced to adjust the initial power allocation. The adjustment is made according to users' rate requirements to guarantee a fair allocation among users of different VOs. Simulation proves our scheme can balance between the energy efficiency and users' rate requirements compared with two conventional schemes.	auction algorithm;compaq lte;game theory;hypervisor;overhead (computing);performance per watt;requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation	Boqiang Fan;Hui Tian;Bin Liu	2015	2015 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2015.7127601	simulation;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	31.00577645477677	93.83214066951604	160952

In this work, spectrum sensing algorithms for CRs that support quality-of-service (QoS) traffic are investigated. Multiple bands are sensed in parallel to reduce the sensing delay, while ensuring a fixed minimum rate for CR transmissions with a given outage probability. Interference constraints are also imposed to protect PU transmissions. Both fixed sample size (FSS) as well as sequential sensing algorithms are developed to minimize the sensing delay. In the sequential sensing case, a bank of sequential probability ratio tests (SPRTs) are run in parallel to detect PU presence in all bands concurrently. Notably, the parameters for the detectors can be obtained via convex optimization. Numerical tests demonstrate that sequential sensing yields average sensing delays significantly smaller than those of FSS sensing.	algorithm;cognitive radio;convex optimization;downtime;flying-spot scanner;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;optimization problem;quality of service;quorum sensing;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio	Seung-Jun Kim;Guobing Li;Georgios B.

Specifically, CR systems are expected to detect idle licensed frequencies (spectrum holes) by applying a spectrum sensing procedure, to take advantage of them for providing service to the SU, and to release them to the licensed primary users (PU) upon request. The duration of the spectrum sensing procedure is an overhead factor that affects the actual utilisation of the spectrum by the CR system and whose adaptation may enhance spectrum utilisation: the less time the CR spends for spectrum sensing and identifying spectrum holes, the more time the spectrum is available for secondary use by the CR. In this paper, we define a formal measure for spectrum hole utilisation in dynamic scenarios and propose a new method for adapting the duration of energy-based spectrum sensing that improves the detection of PU signals as well as the utilisation of spectrum holes by the SU. The proposed method is illustrated with numerical results obtained from simulations which confirm its effectiveness.	cognitive radio	Dusadee Treeumnuk;Dimitrie C.

As opposed to the existing iterative water-filling algorithm, this paper introduces the Stackelberg equilibrium and shows the existence of this equilibrium for the investigated non-cooperative game. We model the two-user case as a bi-level programming problem and derive the necessary optimality conditions. It is analytically shown that a user can improve its performance if it knows the channel state information and the response strategy of the competing user. Due to computationally prohibitive nature of the optimal solution, a practical low- complexity approach is proposed based on the intuition gained from the necessary conditions.

The detection performance may be considerably compromised due to multipath fading and shadowing. To resolve this issue, cooperative sensing is an effective approach to combat channel impairments by cooperation of secondary users. This approach, however, incurs overhead such as delay for reporting local decisions and the increase of control traffic. In this paper, a reinforcement learning-based cooperative sensing (RLCS) method is proposed to address the cooperation overhead problem and improve cooperative gain in cognitive radio ad hoc networks. The proposed algorithm is proven to converge and capable of (1) finding the optimal set of cooperating neighbors with minimum control traffic, (2) minimizings the overall cooperative sensing delay, (3) selecting independent users for cooperation under correlated shadowing, and (4) excluding unreliable users and data from cooperation. Simulation results show that the RLCS method reduces the overhead of cooperative sensing while effectively improving the detection performance to combat correlated shadowing. Moreover, it adapts to environmental change and maintains comparable performance under the impact of primary user activity, user movement, user reliability, and control channel fading.	algorithm;cognitive radio;converge;hoc (programming language);ibm systems network architecture;multipath propagation;optimal stopping;overhead (computing);rl (complexity);reinforcement learning;sensor;simulation;strongly correlated material	Brandon F.

We adopt the two-stage harvest-then-transmit protocol, where the wireless power transfer for the PU is executed first and then the information transfer for the PU takes place. Specifically, two schemes, namely subcarrier sharing (SS) and subcarrier exclusivity, are considered for coordinating the information transfer of the PU and the SU in the second stage. The resource allocation problems to maximize the SU rate subject to the PU minimum rate constraint are investigated. It is shown that the SS scheme achieves higher SU rate than the SE scheme at the cost of higher computation time when the PU minimum rate constraint is stringent and the number of subcarriers is large.	algorithm;cognitive radio;computation;ibm 7950 harvest;ibm systems network architecture;memory management;one-class classification;simulation;subcarrier;superuser;time complexity	Ding Xu;Qiang Li	2017	IEEE Wireless Communications Letters	10.1109/LWC.2017.2727493	computer network;cognitive radio;subcarrier;resource management;wireless sensor network;quality of service;real-time computing;radio resource management;mathematics;information transfer;resource allocation	Mobile	32.04188998102359	90.63397309044804	162484

We design a scheduler that selects a user for transmission and determines the transmission rate of the selected user based on the channel and backlog information of users. Since it requires prohibitively high computation complexity to determine an optimal scheduler for multi-user systems, we propose a low-complexity scheduling scheme that can achieve near-optimal performance. In this scheme, we reduce the complexity by decomposing the multiuser problem into multiple individual user problems. We arrange the probability of selecting each user such that it can be determined only by the information of the corresponding user and then optimize the transmission rate of each user independently. We solve the user problem by using a dynamic programming approach and analyze the upper and lower bounds of average transmission power and average delay, respectively. In addition, we investigate the effects of the user selection algorithm on the performance for different channel models. We show that a channel-adaptive user selection algorithm can improve the energy efficiency under uncorrelated channels but the gain is obtainable only for loose delay requirements in the case of correlated channels. Based on this, we propose a user selection algorithm that adapts itself to both the channel condition and the backlog level, which turns out to be energy-efficient over wide range of delay requirement regardless of the channel model.	channel (communications);computation;dynamic programming;multi-user;requirement;scheduling (computing);selection algorithm;telecommunications link	Hojoong Kwon;Byeong Gi Lee	2008	Journal of Communications and Networks	10.1109/JCN.2008.6388325	real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic programming;mathematics;markov process;upper and lower bounds;estimation theory;scheduling;statistics	Mobile	33.9797392600426	88.73888684990533	162779
9fcf72b9e4f5940f693e66fe3a9424ce435f2ba9	efficient algorithms for physical layer security in two-way relay systems		In this paper, we solve two problems aiming at improving the secure communications in a one-way relay system. The system under consideration consists of one source, one destination, N cooperative relays that use amplify and forward, and one eavesdropper. First, we minimize the relays power under information rate constraints for both the legitimate destination and the eavesdropper. When the source power is given, the problem is formulated as a non-convex quadratically constraint quadratic programming, which can be solved using a semidefinite programming (SDP). However, since SDP suffers from high complexity, we propose a novel approach, using generalized eigenvalue, that provides a closed form of the optimal solution in most cases. Then we prove that the relays power can be further decreased as the source power increases. Second, we solve the problem of maximizing the secrecy rate by looking for the optimal relays beamforming vector. We show that the optimization problem of the beamforming vector is a product of two correlated generalized Rayleigh quotients. For this problem, we show that the optimal beamforming vector can be obtained using a series of SDPs, then we significantly simplify the problem by solving it using a series of eigenvalue problem. Numerical results show that the proposed approaches achieve the optimal solution of the relay beamforming vector and enhance the physical layer security with power allocation.	algorithm;relay	Mohanad Obeed;Wessam Mesbah	2018	Physical Communication	10.1016/j.phycom.2018.03.007	real-time computing;mathematical optimization;eigenvalues and eigenvectors;quadratic programming;semidefinite programming;beamforming;convex optimization;relay;computer science;code rate;optimization problem	EDA	38.30446567735875	89.15738322934585	162786

With respect to the length of channel impulse response (CIR), we first derive a sufficient condition for the optimal pilot pattern generated from the cyclic different set (CDS). Since the CDS does not exist for most practical OFDM systems, we propose three pilot design schemes to obtain a near-optimal pilot pattern. The first two schemes, including stochastic sequential search (SSS) and stochastic parallel search (SPS), are based on the stochastic search. The third scheme called iterative group shrinkage (IGS) employs a tree-based searching structure and removes rows in a group instead of removing a single row at each step. We later extend our work to multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems and propose two schemes, i.e., sequential design scheme and joint design scheme. We also combine them to design the multiple orthogonal pilot patterns, i.e., using the sequential scheme for the first several transmit antennas and using the joint scheme to design the pilot pattern for the remaining transmit antennas. Simulation results show that the proposed SSS, SPS, and IGS converge much faster than the cross-entropy optimization and the exhaustive search and are thus more efficient. Moreover, SSS and SPS outperform IGS in terms of channel estimation performance.	brute-force search;channel state information;converge;cross entropy;ibm 1401 symbolic programming system;iterative method;linear search;mimo;mathematical optimization;multiplexing;simulation;sparse matrix;stochastic optimization	Chenhao Qi;Guosen Yue;Lenan Wu;Yongming Huang;Arumugam Nallanathan	2015	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2014.2331085	design;mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;recovery;coherence;orthogonality;telecommunications;transmission;computer science;mathematics;statistics;mimo	Mobile	39.277838552783834	88.652642576213	162997

This paper proposes a factor graph based approach to solve the dynamic spectrum allocation problem in an efficient manner. With the proposed DWA-Tree (Distributed Wave Algorithm), this problem can be solved with 2n number of messages for tree structured graphs. This paper also proposes another novel algorithm called DWA-Cycle to solve the problem for general graphs with cycles. Simulation results show that both DWA-Tree and DWA-Cycle can improve the global link quality consistently better than naive local optimization approaches.	algorithm;cognitive network;cognitive radio;digital watermarking alliance;dynamic window approach;factor graph;frequency allocation;interference (communication);malware;mathematical optimization;simulation	Shu Chen;Yan Huang;Kamesh Namuduri	2011	2011 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2011.5779243	mathematical optimization;cognitive radio;computer science;resource management;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;computer network	EDA	30.944812533377732	97.14966423135095	163382

In this paper, we describe the recent advances in jointing networking, caching, and computing and present a novel integrated framework: software-defined networking, caching, and computing SD-NCC. SD-NCC enables dynamic orchestration of networking, caching, and computing resources to efficiently meet the requirements of different applications and improve the end-to-end system performance. Energy consumption is considered as an important factor when performing resource placement in this paper. Specifically, we study the joint caching, computing, and bandwidth resource allocation for SD-NCC and formulate it as an optimization problem. In addition, to reduce computational complexity and signaling overhead, we propose a distributed algorithm to solve the formulated problem, based on recent advances in alternating direction method of multipliers ADMM, in which different network nodes only need to solve their own problems without exchange of caching/computing decisions with fast convergence rate. Simulation results show the effectiveness of our proposed framework and ADMM-based algorithm with different system parameters.	augmented lagrangian method;cache (computing);centralized computing;computational complexity theory;distributed algorithm;end system;end-to-end principle;mathematical optimization;neural correlates of consciousness;optimization problem;overhead (computing);performance;rate of convergence;requirement;server (computing);simulation;software-defined networking	Qingxia Chen;Fei Richard Yu;Tao Huang;Renchao Xie;Jiang Liu;Yunjie Liu	2016	2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/TNET.2017.2782216	orchestration (computing);distributed algorithm;distributed computing;resource management;software-defined networking;cloud computing;computer science;dynamic priority scheduling;resource allocation;optimization problem	HPC	25.267491484523635	96.00768232003303	163403

For secondary users, sensing costs are incurred as the result of primary users' activity. Furthermore, each secondary user pays the cost of transmission upon successful bidding for a channel. Knowledge regarding other secondary users' activity is limited due to the distributed nature of the network. The resulting formulation is thus a dynamic game with incomplete information. To solve such a problem, a Bayesian nonparametric belief update scheme is constructed based on the Dirichlet process. Efficient bidding learning algorithms are proposed via which users can decide whether or not to participate in the bidding according to the belief update. Properties of optimal bidding and initial bidding are proved. As demonstrated through extensive simulations, the proposed distributed scheme outperforms a myopic one-stage algorithm, and can achieve a good trade-off between long-term efficiency and fairness.	algorithm;cognitive radio;fairness measure;genie;heuristic;machine learning;optimal control;simulation	Zhu Han;Rong Zheng;H.

Two important challenges in wireless communications are the unreliability of the wireless links and the interference among the wireless links. In order to exploit reliable video multicast, forward error correction and network coding can be used. In this paper, we propose a reliable video multicast method over wireless networks with multiple Access Points (AP). Using multiple APs, the multicast receivers can benefit from both spatial and time diversities, which results in more reliable transmissions. In order to utilize the shared wireless network efficiently, we propose a resource allocation algorithm. We show that a systematic concurrent transmission of the interfering AP nodes can enhance the total system performance and provide fairness to the client nodes. Therefore, in contrast with the previous resource sharing methods, which only permit the AP nodes that do not interfere with each other to transmit concurrently, we allow the interfering nodes to transmit concurrently, and we propose a two-phase resource allocation algorithm to further enhance the system utility. We show the effectiveness of our proposed method through extensive simulations.	algorithm;error detection and correction;fairness measure;forward error correction;interference (communication);internet;linear network coding;multicast;nc (complexity);simulation;smartphone;streaming media;tablet computer;two-phase commit protocol;two-phase locking	Pouya Ostovari;Jie Wu	2015	2015 IEEE 16th International Symposium on A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM)	10.1109/WoWMoM.2015.7158170	real-time computing;multicast;wireless wan;wireless site survey;reliable multicast;telecommunications;computer science;linear programming;radio resource management;wireless network;pragmatic general multicast;reliability;interference;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;fixed wireless;wireless;computer network	Mobile	30.83258808585953	89.68327380237118	163885

A practical network scenario, where multiple virtual wireless service providers (WSPs) request the VR from a unique mobile network operator (MNO) is considered. Our objective is two folds. The first is to guarantee the minimum rate requirements of the MNO and the WSPs. The second is to distribute the system rate among the MNO and the WSPs in the Pareto optimal manner. To this end, an efficient VR allocation scheme based on bargaining game theory is proposed, and the Nash bargaining solution (NBS) method is used to solve the proposed game problem. The proposed game problem is proved to be a convex optimization problem. By using standard convex optimization method, the global optimal NBS of the game is obtained in closed form. The effectiveness of the proposed VR allocation game is testified through numerical results. 针对虚拟蜂窝网络的频谱资源分配问题, 综合考虑技术层面的因素, 如时变的无线信道质量和蜂窝网络所采用的物理层协议, 以及移动网络运营商 (MNO) 和虚拟服务提供商 (WSP) 的网络效用因素, 提出一种基于协作博弈论的虚拟网络资源分配方案. 该方案能够满足 MNO 和 WSP 的最低频谱资源需求, 并能将有限的虚拟网络资源以帕累托最优的方式在各 MNO 和 WSP 之间进行分配.	compaq lte;convex optimization;elegant degradation;experiment;game theory;mathematical optimization;nash equilibrium;netbeans ide;numerical analysis;optimization problem;pareto efficiency;requirement	Guopeng Zhang;Kun Yang;Ke Xu;Yongquan Dong	2015	Science China Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-015-5457-9	mathematical optimization;simulation;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing	Metrics	30.936332609614368	93.48809440280316	163903

The main advantage of the proposed algorithm is that it ensures non-overlapping channel assignment with no overhead power measurements. The proposed channel assignment algorithm can be implemented within practical time frames for different topology sizes. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm exhibits better performance than that of the pick-first greedy algorithm and the single channel assignment method.	assignment problem;greedy algorithm;integer programming;iteration;linear programming;mathematical optimization;minimax;overhead (computing);simulation;wireless access point	Mohamed Elwekeil;Masoud Alghoniemy;Osamu Muta;Adel B.

We propose two local optimization-based approximation algorithms to efficiently estimate certain attempt rate parameters of CSMA called fugacities. It is known that adaptive CSMA can achieve throughput optimality by sampling feasible schedules from a Gibbs distribution, with appropriate fugacities. Unfortunately, obtaining these optimal fugacities is an NP-hard problem. Furthermore, the existing adaptive CSMA algorithms use a stochastic gradient descent-based method, which usually entails an impractically slow exponential in the size of the network convergence to the optimal fugacities. To address this issue, we first propose an algorithm to estimate the fugacities, that can support a given set of desired service rates. The convergence rate and the complexity of this algorithm are independent of the network size, and depend only on the neighborhood size of a link. Furthermore, we show that the proposed algorithm corresponds exactly to performing the well-known Bethe approximation to the underlying Gibbs distribution. Then, we propose another local algorithm to estimate the optimal fugacities under a utility maximization framework, and characterize its accuracy. Numerical results indicate that the proposed methods have a good degree of accuracy, and achieve extremely fast convergence to near-optimal fugacities, and often outperform the convergence rate of the stochastic gradient descent by a few orders of magnitude.	approximation algorithm;expectation–maximization algorithm;interference (communication);local algorithm;mathematical optimization;np-hardness;network convergence;rate of convergence;sampling (signal processing);scheduling (computing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;stochastic gradient descent;throughput;time complexity;whole earth 'lectronic link	Peruru Subrahmanya Swamy;Radha Krishna Ganti;Krishna P.

We propose a preemptive resume priority (PRP) M/G/1 queueing network model to evaluate total service time for various target channels selections. Then, we suggest a low-complexity greedy algorithm to select target channels. Numerical results show that a spectrum handoff scheme based on greedy selection strategy can reduce total service time compared to the randomly selection scheme.	cognitive radio;greedy algorithm;network model;parallel redundancy protocol;queueing theory;randomness	Chung-Wang Wang;Li-Chung Wang	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2009.5199189	cognitive radio;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	26.71114429518477	97.37996868937286	164406

Most papers addressing NOMA consider a single cell. We take a significant step of analyzing NOMA in multi-cell scenarios. We explore the potential of NOMA networks in achieving optimal resource utilization with arbitrary topologies. Towards this goal, we investigate a broad class of problems. Namely, any problem consisting in optimizing power allocation and user pairing in NOMA with a cost function that is monotonically increasing in time-frequency resource consumption, falls into our problem class. We propose an algorithm that solves the problems optimally with fast convergence. Numerically, we evaluate and demonstrate the performance of NOMA for multi-cell scenarios in terms of resource efficiency and load balancing.	algorithm;interference (communication);load balancing (computing);loss function;mathematical optimization;network architecture;numerical integration;oma;optimizing compiler;spectral efficiency	Lei You;Di Yuan;Lei Lei;Sumei Sun;Symeon Chatzinotas;Björn E.

4c7cac673573fcb53e42ebb072a20fb99d2f664f	spectrum sharing in heterogeneous networks based on multi-objective optimization		Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets) are being considered a promising way to significantly boost the overall spectral efficiency by using spectrum-sharing scheme to deploy femto base stations (FBSs) within a macrocell network. However, the co-channel deployment also brings a severe problem of interference containing intra-tier interference among FBSs and inter-tier interference between FBSs and the macro base station (MBS), which significantly influences the system capacity. In this paper, we investigate a spectrum sharing scheme in the downlink for HetNets, aiming to mitigate the intra-tier interference and improve the capacity of system. The spectrum-sharing scheme is described as a multi-objective optimization problem. The problem is solved by nondominated sorting genetic algorithm version II(NSGA-II). The simulations show that the proposed spectrum-sharing scheme is superior to the existing APLCA.	channel capacity;genetic algorithm;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;multitier architecture;optimization problem;simulation;software deployment;sorting;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link	Jiajia Zhu;Run-ze Wu;Liangrui Tang;Shiyu Ji	2016	2016 19th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications (WPMC)		macrocell;heterogeneous network;computer network;telecommunications link;computer science;multi-objective optimization;femto-;femtocell;optimization problem;spectral efficiency	Arch	28.77197441158145	91.46835025649132	164700

Mobile broadband networks are expected to operate under frequency reuse factor one and are therefore interference-limited. We derive a novel framework for resource-fair sum rate maximization in OFDMA multicell deployments with single antenna links where power allocation among subchannels is predefined. The framework holds for multiband scenarios with non-contiguously aggregated carriers. Our proposed algorithm for joint subchannel scheduling is based on semidefinite reformulation and programming techniques. It has a significant contribution by taking into account active control of inter-cell interference on shared frequency resources. We achieve throughput bounds and near-optimal feasible sum rates under guarantee of interference temperature constraints by extensively exploiting all degrees of the three-dimensional binary assignment problem. We give simulation results that are compliant with wireless propagation assumptions under the Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard. Moreover, we show that the network performance can gain substantial improvements by our scheme when compared to the current generation of wireless networks where subchannel assignment has distributed implementations among locally operating cell sites.	assignment problem;automated theorem proving;compaq lte;data rate units;digital subchannel;expectation–maximization algorithm;fairness measure;interference (communication);linear programming relaxation;mobile phone;network performance;relaxation (iterative method);requirement;scheduling (computing);semidefinite programming;simulation;social inequality;software deployment;software propagation;telecommunications link;the matrix;theory;throughput	Bernd Holfeld;Antje Relitz;Thomas Wirth;Eduard Axel Jorswieck	2014	2014 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DYSPAN)	10.1109/DySPAN.2014.6817830	channel allocation schemes;electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;radio resource management;computer network	Mobile	31.70204626928021	90.94678608613799	164784

The channel assignment problem for multi-radio multi-channel multihop WLAN mesh networks is complex NP-hard, and channel assignment, routing and power control are tightly coupled. To mitigate the co-channel interference and improve capacity in multi-channel and multi-interface WLAN mesh networks, a power-efficient spatial reusable channel assignment scheme is proposed, which considers both channel diversity and spatial reusability to reduce co-channel interference by joint adjusting channel, transmission power and routing. In order to assign channel appropriately, an efficient power control scheme and a simple heuristic algorithm is introduced to achieve this objective, which adjust the channel and power level of each radio according to the current channel conditions so as to increase the opportunity of channel spatial reusability. The proposed channel assignment scheme also takes load, capacity and interference of links into consideration. Simulation results show the effectiveness of our approach and demonstrate that the proposed scheme can get better performance than other approaches in terms of throughput, blocking ratio, energy consumption and end-to-end delay.	mesh networking	Rongbo Zhu;Jiangqing Wang	2012	MONET	10.1007/s11036-011-0302-x	wireless mesh network;switched mesh;telecommunications;power control;computer science;shared mesh;computer network	Mobile	29.08915118003925	90.71417227014348	164785

As an application, relaxed zero-forcing (RZF) beamforming is presented which adopts a specific quadratic constraint that bounds the power of residual interference in the beamformer output with the aid of interference-channel side-information available typically in wireless multiple-access systems. The dual-domain projection in this case plays a role in guiding the adaptive algorithm towards a better direction to minimize the interference and noise, leading to considerably faster convergence. The robustness issue against channel mismatch and ill-posedness is also addressed. Numerical examples show that the efficient use of interference side-information brings considerable gains.	adaptive algorithm;adaptive beamformer;beamforming;interference (communication);numerical method;quadratically constrained quadratic program;semiconductor industry;social inequality;well-posed problem	Masahiro Yukawa;Youngchul Sung;Gunwoo Lee	2013	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2013.2254481	mathematical optimization;computer science;adaptive beamformer;control theory;mathematics	Vision	38.425332192042	89.98627077996206	165128

In this system, to implement two-way relaying scheme, a secondary multi-antenna node acts as a relay and helps two primary users (PUs) communicate with each other and in return the secondary node superposes its signal to filtered signals of PUs. The authors intend to design secondary transceiver under two criteria, one from the viewpoint of improving the performance of secondary network and the other to guarantee quality of service (QoS) of primary network. The first criterion is to maximise the signal-to-interference-plusnoise ratio (SINR) of secondary receiver subject to constraints on QoS of PUs and the relay transmitted power. For the other one, the goal is to achieve max-min fairness among PUs through maximising the worse signal-to-interferenceplus-noise ratio (SINR) of PUs subject to constraints on QoS of secondary receiver and transmit power of relay. The authors employ an alternating optimisation algorithm to find the beamforming matrices and the allocated power to secondary receiver’s message in these non-convex problems. Simulation results show that the proposed FF approach has better performance compared with simple AF relaying strategy.	algorithm;beamforming;cognitive radio;fairness measure;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;max-min fairness;maxima and minima;quality of service;relay;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;transceiver	Marjan Maleki;Vahid Tabataba Vakili	2015	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2015.0043	quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	35.788161703247894	90.14295856736912	165249

Valid results for this game include stable (if agents have no unilateral incentive to deviate), balanced (if matched agents obtain similar benefits from collaborating), or Nash (both stable and balanced) outcomes. We design provably correct continuous-time algorithms to find each of these classes of outcomes in a distributed way. Our algorithmic design to find Nash bargaining solutions builds on the other two algorithms by having the dynamics for finding stable outcomes feeding into the one for finding balanced ones. Our technical approach to establish convergence and robustness combines notions and tools from optimization, graph theory, nonsmooth analysis, and Lyapunov stability theory and provides a useful framework for further extensions. We illustrate our results in a wireless communication scenario where single-antenna devices have the possibility of working as 2-antenna virtual devices to improve channel capacity.	algorithm;channel capacity;converge;correctness (computer science);dyadic transformation;emoticon;graph theory;lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;nash equilibrium;rate of convergence;scott continuity;semi-continuity;subderivative	Dean Richert;Jorge Cortés	2016	IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems	10.1109/TCNS.2015.2476215	mathematical optimization;convergence;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;linear programming;artificial intelligence;trajectory;resource management;theoretical computer science;control theory;distributed computing;computer network	Robotics	34.1094764457874	94.3286063961186	165486

Especially with incorporating multiple orthogonal channels and multiple directional antennas into the WMN, each node can communicate with its neighbor nodes simultaneously without interference between them. In addition, due to directional antennas, the interference range of each transmission can be significantly reduced and we can further utilize the frequency separation. Hence, we can improve the throughput of the WMN significantly with multiple orthogonal channels and multiple directional antennas. In this paper, we study a joint channel and flow assignment problem for the WMN with multiple channels and multiple directional antennas. We first formulate an optimization problem as a mixed integer optimization problem that aims at maximizing the network utility. Since it is inherently hard to solve the mixed integer optimization problem, we propose a heuristic algorithm to solve the problem. The simulation results show our heuristic algorithm provides a reasonable performance in terms of the network utility compared to its upper bound.	algorithm;assignment problem;heuristic (computer science);interference (communication);mathematical optimization;mesh networking;network topology;network utility;optimization problem;simulation;throughput;wireless mesh network	Hee-Tae Roh;Jang-Won Lee	2014	The International Conference on Information Networking 2014 (ICOIN2014)	10.1109/ICOIN.2014.6799681	wireless mesh network;integer programming;telecommunications;computer science;telecommunications service;hidden node problem;computer network;broadband networks	Mobile	29.06192873670043	92.56124907153375	165713

We assume one macrocell base station (MBS) and several femtocell base stations (FBSs) simultaneously send information to their macrocell users (MUs) and femtocell users, respectively. Meanwhile, the FBSs also transfer energy to some energy receivers, who act as the potential eavesdroppers and are able to wiretap the confidential messages to one MU via the cross-tier interference links. Exploiting interference in the considered HetNet, we jointly optimize the beamforming vectors and artificial noise of the MBS and the FBSs to maximize the secrecy rate of the eavesdropped MU under the quality-of-service, energy harvesting, and transmit power constraints at relevant receivers/transmitters. In particular, we first investigate the ideal case with perfect eavesdropper’s channel state information (ECSI) and the optimization problem turns out to be nonconvex. By using the tools of semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and one-dimensional line search, we successfully transfer the original problem into a more tractable two-stage problem to obtain the optimal solution. Furthermore, we extend our study to the imperfect ECSI case, where the worst-case based solution is obtained with the aid of SDR and successive convex approximation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and also bring useful insights into the design of secure SWIPT in the presence of interference.	approximation algorithm;beamforming;best, worst and average case;channel state information;cobham's thesis;confidentiality;etsi satellite digital radio;interference (communication);lagrangian relaxation;line search;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;multitier architecture;optimization problem;quality of service;secure communication;simulation;telecommunications link;transmitter	Yuan Ren;Tiejun Lv;Hui Gao;Yingxiang Li	2017	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2682277	erbium;telecommunications link;telecommunications;interference;wireless;computer network	Mobile	37.31264697311434	89.97128199694943	166058

More specifically, a repeated auction is proposed for the resource allocation problem, in which secondary users (SUs) share the primary spectrum under the interference constraints of primary users (PUs). With the inter-cell interference and mutual interference between PUs and SUs, the resource allocation problem is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem. Auction performs well in solving non-convex problems, therefore the interference auction is proposed. Moreover, with the theoretical analysis of equilibrium, an implementation algorithm for the auction is developed and the convergence is proved. Simulation results show that the interference auction obtains a good spectrum efficiency improvement and a rapid convergence rate.	cognitive radio;mimo-ofdm	Mehdi Ghamari Adian;Hassan Aghaeinia	2015	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-014-2007-5	auction algorithm;cognitive radio;simulation;mimo-ofdm;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;auction theory;computer network	Mobile	32.30627339648016	93.25739861190156	166662
5338cef43a0d84f53acedb012d025d89d7bb6951	mobile service-based cooperative scheduling for high-mobility vehicular networks		This paper investigates the downlink scheduling for relay-aided high-mobility vehicular networks, where the vehicles with good vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links are employed as cooperative relay nodes to help the ones with poor V2I links forward information via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links. I n existing works, instantaneous achievable information rate was wide ly adopted to perform the link scheduling, but it is not efficient for vehicular networks, especially for high-mobility scenarios. Different from them, in this paper, we introduce the mobile service to describe the mobile link capacity of vehicular ne tworks and then we propose a mobile service based relaying scheduli ng (MSRS) for high mobility vehicular networks. In order to explore the system information transmission performance l imit, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the mobile service amount of MSRS by jointly scheduling the V2I and V2V links. Since it is a combinational optimization problem which is too complex to solve, we design an efficient algorith m with low-complexity for it, where Sort-then-Select, Hungarian algorithm and Bisection search are employed. Simulation re sults demonstrate that our proposed MSRS is able to achieve the optimal results with an optimal approximation ratio larger than 96.5%. It is also shown that our proposed MSRS is much more efficient for high-mobility vehicular systems, which can improve the system average throughput with increment of 3.6 3% compared with existing instantaneous achievable informat ion rate based scheduling method, and with 15% increment compared with traditional non-cooperation scheduling method, respectively.	approximation algorithm;bisection method;combinational logic;computer multitasking;hungarian algorithm;mathematical optimization;microsoft robotics developer studio;model-specific register;optimization problem;relay;scheduling (computing);simulation;system information (windows);telecommunications link;throughput;vehicle-to-vehicle	Yu M.

1c047080100cdec3c67ed930cfca537a56a5a538	energy-efficient massive cellular iot shared spectrum access via mobile data aggregators		Due to the ubiquitous presence of cellular networks and their exemplary success, they have been pushed forward to provide connectivity for Internet-of-things (IoT) applications with mass deployments of sensors and machines. Nevertheless, existing transmission protocols, e.g., orthogonal allocation or spectrum sharing, can be detrimental for both existing cellular users and IoT devices due to increased congestion, interference, or resource splitting. To this end, we propose to complement cellular networks with authorized mobile data aggregators, e.g., drones, that collect data from IoT devices and aggregate them to the cellular network. The proposed cellular architecture is supported by a novel transmission protocol and load-aware power control. The former enables IoT devices to operate over the same channel with existing cellular users, increasing the available spectral resources, whereas the latter constrains the interference on these users. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed architecture compared to orthogonal allocation and spectrum sharing. It is shown that the proposed architecture significantly improves the energy efficiency of IoT devices, with minimal degradation on the spectral efficiency of existing cellular users.	aggregate data;authorization;cellular architecture;coexist (image);data aggregation;elegant degradation;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;network congestion;sensor;simulation;spectral efficiency;test-driven development	Ghaith Hattab;Danijela Cabric	2017	2017 IEEE 13th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)	10.1109/WiMOB.2017.8115790	computer network;mobile broadband;power control;architecture;computer science;mobile computing;distributed computing;cellular architecture;cellular network;communication channel;spectral efficiency	Mobile	25.791843379180374	89.64118930044319	166813

Small cells aim at increasing coverage and capacity. Coverage both at cell edges and indoor environments can be significantly improved by relays and small cells. Capacity is inherently limited because of the limited spectrum, and although 4G wireless networks have been able to provide a considerable amount of increase in capacity, it has always been challenging to keep up with the growing user demands. In particular, the high volume of traffic resulting from video uploads or downloads is the major reason for the ever growing user demand. In the Internet, content caching at locations closer to the users have been a successful approach to enhance resource utilization. Very recently, content caching within the wireless network has been considered for 4G networks. In this paper, we propose an Integer Linear Programming (ILP)-based energy-efficient content placement approach for small cells. The proposed model, namely minimize Uplink Power and Caching Power (minUPCA), jointly minimizes uplink and caching powers. We compare the performance of minUPCA with a scheme that only aims to minimize uplink power. Our results show that minUPCA provides a compromise between the uplink energy budget of the User Equipment (UE) and the caching energy budget of the Small Cell Base Station (SCBS).	access network;cache (computing);compaq lte;heuristic;integer programming;internet;linear programming;mathematical optimization;network performance;optimization problem;relay;scalability;solar cell;telecommunications link;upload	Melike Erol-Kantarci	2015	2015 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2015.7127804	embedded system;real-time computing;computer science;computer network	Mobile	25.566831596058577	91.62511089810909	167058

A well-behaved resource allocation strategy is crucial for the performance of such systems. In this paper, we systematically study the allocation problem from a game theory perspective for the multiuser downlink broadcast channel. First, we investigate the application of the Nash and Kalai-Smorodinsky bargaining games to a general resource allocation problem and propose algorithms to find the corresponding solutions. Then we apply the general solutions to the special case where spatial block diagonalization is combined with time-sharing to multiplex a subset of the users on every subcarrier. To reduce the computational complexity, a framework for simplifying the resulting algorithms is also given. Numerical results and analysis are provided to compare the performance of the different resource allocation methods.	algorithm;bisection method;computational complexity theory;convex optimization;decision problem;fairness measure;frequency divider;game theory;heuristic (computer science);mimo-ofdm;mathematical optimization;multiplexing;nash equilibrium;netbeans ide;numerical linear algebra;optimization problem;polynomial;scheduling (computing);simulation;subcarrier;telecommunications link;time complexity;time-sharing	Jie Chen;A.

However, this interference reducing ability comes at the expense of increased feedback, backhaul load and computational complexity. The degree of coordination is therefore limited in practice. In this paper we explore the trade-off between capacity and feedback load in a cellular network with coordination clusters. Our main interest lies in a scenario with multiple fading users in each cell. The results indicate that a large fraction of the total gain can be achieved by a significant reduction in feedback. We also find an approximate expression for the distribution of the instantaneous signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and propose a new effective scheduling algorithm.	approximation algorithm;backhaul (telecommunications);computational complexity theory;feedback;interference (communication);scheduling (computing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio	Hans Jørgen Bang;Pål Orten	2011	2011 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2011.5779417	signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;statistics	Mobile	31.066110826315242	89.01258133347972	167540

The proposed algorithm has the same computational complexity as the best algorithm in the literature for the same problem but with minimum rate constraints. While the convergence of the algorithm in the literature is not guaranteed, the algorithm in this paper is proven to converge. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm out-performs the one in the literature when the rate constraints are ignored.	algorithm;computational complexity theory;converge;digital subchannel;frequency allocation;joule;linear equation;nonlinear system;simulation;telecommunications link	Kandasamy Illanko;Muhammad Ali Naeem;Alagan Anpalagan;Dimitrios Androutsos	2014	IEEE Wireless Communications Letters	10.1109/WCL.2014.032814.130888	communications protocol;mathematical optimization;real-time computing;frequency allocation;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;theoretical computer science;mathematical model;mathematics;efficient energy use;computational complexity theory	EDA	32.82822418477372	91.6157418107193	167788

The receivers are assumed to be able to cancel interference by simultaneously processing at most two codewords. Receivers may be served by either the closest cell or a neighboring cell; in the latter case, the receiver cancels the interference from its own cell transmission, and receives the other-cell transmission without this interference. A distributed network utility optimization problem is formulated to exploit this possibility. In a HetNet simulation, where proportional fair network utility is maximized, we observe significant gains for cell-edge users, accompanied by a moderate gain for the network capacity.	cell (microprocessor);cell signaling;code word;convex optimization;data rate units;distributed algorithm;fairness measure;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;network utility;optimization problem;proportionally fair;radio resource management;semantic network;simplified instructional computer;simulation;telecommunications link;uncompressed video	Liang Zhou;Kalle Ruttik;Olav Tirkkonen;Randall Berry	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Communication Systems	10.1109/ICCS.2014.7024779	single antenna interference cancellation;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;base station;operating system;co-channel interference;wireless;computer network	Mobile	31.77195414710199	89.98007557287588	167845

Unlike a conventional system in which a fixed signal constellation is employed for all the bits of a user (for given channel conditions and noise power), power control with signal constellation randomization involves randomization/time-sharing among different signal constellations for each user. A formulation is obtained for the problem of optimal power control with signal constellation randomization, and it is shown that the optimal solution can be represented by a randomization among (K+1) or fewer distinct signal constellations for each user, where K denotes the number of users. In addition to the original nonconvex formulation, an approximate solution based on convex relaxation is derived. Then, detailed performance analysis is presented when the receivers employ symmetric signaling and sign detectors. Specifically, the maximum asymptotical improvement ratio is shown to be equal to the number of users, and the conditions under which the maximum and minimum asymptotical improvement ratios are achieved are derived. Numerical examples are presented to investigate the theoretical results, and to illustrate performance improvements achieved via the proposed approach.	ampersand;approximation algorithm;asymptote;linear programming relaxation;maxima and minima;multi-user;noise power;numerical method;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;telecommunications link;time-sharing	Mehmet Emin Tutay;Sinan Gezici;Orhan Arikan	2013	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TW.2013.081413.121418	code division multiple access;optimal control;telecommunications;power control;computer science;signal processing;control theory;mathematics;spread spectrum	Mobile	36.006933399837905	88.68314908244699	168064

Our study proposes a hierarchical joint subchannel and power allocation algorithm in orthogonal frequency division multiple access femtocell networks. FBSs and MBSs in the network maximize their capacity and compete with each other through resource allocation strategy. This competition is captured in the framework of a Stackelberg game, and the Stackelberg equilibrium is introduced as the solution to the problem. An iterative method is proposed for MBSs and FBSs to achieve the hierarchical Stackelberg equilibrium. We specifically recommend a new power allocation function for MBS. The best response strategy of MBS can be directly obtained by using the proposed power-allocation function. As a result, costs are decreased. We also divide the strategy of MBSs into two substrategies, namely, subchannel selection strategy and power strategy. The two substrategies interact with each other in the game process to improve the flexibility of the MBS strategy. A dynamic step-size mechanism is proposed to accelerate the algorithm. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm under high-interference conditions.	algorithm;digital subchannel;telecommunications link	Song Han;Xinbin Li;Zhixin Liu;Xin-Ping Guan	2016	J.

However, there is a tradeoff between system capacity and fairness among users. Nash bargaining solution (NBS) in cooperative game theory can be used to solve this tradeoff problem. However, very high computational complexity is required to find the NBS. In this paper, we propose a reduced complexity suboptimal NBS based subcarrier allocation, which requires lower computational complexity while achieving the system capacity and fairness among users similar to the NBS. The proposed suboptimal NBS subcarrier allocation is applied to distributed antenna network (DAN) using frequency-domain space-time transmit diversity (FD-STTD). Numerical computation results show that the proposed NBS based subcarrier allocation achieves the system capacity comparable to Proportionally Fair (PF) map while achieving a higher fairness than PF map.	carrier frequency;channel capacity;computation;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;fairness measure;frequency divider;game theory;multi-user;nash equilibrium;netbeans ide;numerical analysis;proportionally fair;subcarrier;telecommunications link	Yusuke Sato;Ryusuke Matsukawa;Tatsunori Obara;Fumiyuki Adachi	2012	2012 3rd IEEE International Conference on Network Infrastructure and Digital Content	10.1109/ICNIDC.2012.6418715	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;communication	Robotics	33.40200929500734	90.55508129795014	168379

The scheme is semi-distributed in the sense that the RRC decision is split between RNC and BSs. RNC makes decision on which channel is used by which BS at super-frame level and BSs then make decision on which user is assigned to which channel at frame-level. Two optimization problems for RNC and BSs are formulated and computationally efficient algorithms that perform the function of interference avoidance and traffic/channel adaptation are developed. Numerical analysis is performed under several cell configurations to show tradeoffs between sector interference suppression and dynamic interference avoidance.

This paper proposes an optimum transmit beamforming scheme that allows multiple SU, stationary and/or moving, to co-exist with a stationary PU. With knowledge of channel information only between the secondary transmitter and stationary users (but not moving SU), the optimization problem is formulated to ensure maximum transmission power towards the desired SU, while constraining the interference to PU. The transmission power is constant in an area of angles when the SU is not static. The interference to PU can be forced to zero. By first converting the problem into convex form, the optimum solution is obtained through second-order cone programming. Simulation results show that the probability of successful transmission between SU is significantly boosted without degrading the communication of the PU. Simulation results also show that the proposed scheme maintains uniform transmission power for moving SU within a desired range of directions, while nulling the interference to PU and other SU.	beamforming;cognitive radio;cone (formal languages);conic optimization;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;optimization problem;second-order cone programming;simulation;spectral efficiency;stationary process;superuser;transmitter	Sudeep Bhattarai;Liang Hong;Sachin Shetty	2013	2013 16th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications (WPMC)		additive white gaussian noise;cognitive radio;convex optimization;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	36.23144691090863	89.18763511717565	168427
3556d66fc49e20803764ac975c066cdad256d642	weighted sum rate maximization for zero-forcing methods with general linear covariance constraints		In this paper, an efficient approach for weighted sum rate maximization (WSRMax) for zero-forcing (ZF) methods with general linear transmit covariance constraints (LTCCs) is proposed. This problem has been extensively studied separately for some special cases such as for sum power or per-antenna power constraint (PAPC). Due to some practical and regulatory requirements, these power constraints alone are not in general sufficient, which motivates the consideration of general LTCCs. On the other hand, the zero-forcing (ZF) is a simple linear precoding technique to mitigate inter-user interference. The problem of WSRMax for ZF methods with LTCCs was studied previously using a gradient descent algorithm with barrier functions, but this method was also shown to converge slowly. To derive an efficient solution to this problem, we first reformulate it as an equivalent minimax problem using Lagrangian duality. The obtained result in fact resembles BC-MAC duality but is specialized for ZF methods. We then combine alternating optimization and concave-convex procedure to efficiently compute a saddle point of the minimax problem. The proposed method is numerically shown to converge very fast and its complexity scales linearly with the number of users.	augmented lagrangian method;barrier function;concave function;converge;duality (optimization);expectation–maximization algorithm;gradient descent;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;minimax;numerical analysis;requirement;weight function;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding	Thuy M.

e574ec6c93a6f54c71fa2078da7f09ee10e2bfc7	adaptive joint bandwidth and power allocation in heterogeneous wireless access environment	adaptive stepsize;resource allocation	Joint bandwidth and power allocation for a multi-radio access (MRA) system in a heterogeneous wireless access environment is studied. Since both the number of users being served by the system and the wireless channel state are time-varying, the optimal resource allocation is no longer a static optimum and will change with the varying network state. Moreover, distributed resource allocation algorithms that require iterative updating and signaling interactions cannot converge in negligible time. Thus, it is unrealistic to assume that the active user number and the wireless channel state remain unchanged during the iterations. In this paper, we propose an adaptive joint bandwidth and power allocation algorithm based on a novel iteration stepsize selection method, which can adapt to the varying network state and accelerate the convergence rate. A distributed solution is also designed for the adaptive joint resource allocation implementation. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can not only track the varying optimal resource allocation result much more quickly than a traditional algorithm with fixed iteration stepsize, but can also reduce the data transmission time for users and increase the system throughput.	adaptive stepsize;converge;distributed algorithm;gradient descent;interaction;iteration;iterative method;lagrange multiplier;moe;mathematical optimization;memory management;numerical method;optimization problem;rate of convergence;reynolds-averaged navier–stokes equations;simulation;stationary process;throughput	Jilei Yan;Jiandong Li;Linjing Zhao	2013	Science China Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-013-4953-z	mathematical optimization;real-time computing;computer science;static memory allocation;distributed computing	Metrics	33.34641687488303	94.4991198494785	168526
cc440161b6f264a06aa3c45b120c512b0ce844c6	on placement and efficient resource allocation of laa/lte-u base stations in hetnet		LTE operation in unlicensed spectrum is considered as a promising solution to meet the increase in user data demand. Licensed Assisted Access (LAA), and duty cycled LTE-U are two options for LTE to operate in the unlicensed band for fair sharing of unlicensed spectrum with IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi). Due to restriction on the transmission power in the unlicensed band, LAA/LTE-U Base Stations (BSs) will get deployed mostly inside residential and office buildings to provide high data rates for indoor User Equipments (UEs). In an indoor scenario, walls and other obstacles in the communication path along with co-tier and cross-tier interferences decrease the Signal-to-Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) significantly which results in throughput decrease. Hence, an optimal placement of LAA BSs is essential. As the available bandwidth in the unlicensed spectrum is more compared to the licensed spectrum, an efficient resource allocation is also necessary for ensuring minimum throughput for the indoor UEs. In this paper, our goal is to find the optimal number of LAA/LTE-U BSs with minimum throughput guarantee inside the building using licensed and unlicensed bands. To do this, we formulate an optimization model (MinLAA) for LAA BSs placement which is Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) problem. So, we propose a heuristic algorithm to find the minimum number of LAA/LTE-U BSs such that all the users inside the building get minimum guaranteed throughput.	algorithm;compaq lte;heuristic (computer science);interference (communication);linear programming;mathematical optimization;multitier architecture;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;throughput	Anand M.

d78b360333f49bac230f3eaf40fb9445c9e18d6b	truthful mechanisms for message dissemination via device-to-device communications		Device-to-device (D2D) communications are not only featured by high spectral and energy efficiency, but also offer appealing benefits for applications, such as message dissemination, traffic offloading, and coverage expansion. In this paper, we consider a message dissemination scenario where a base station (BS) can direct message requests to be fulfilled by some source devices via D2D communications and thereby save the resource cost. Furthermore, a source device may be subject to a cost budget due to its limited resources. To minimize the overall cost or maximize the BS's cost saving from offloading, it is essential to properly assign the message request(s) for each source and decide the payment to incentivize participation. The request direction is an NP-hard problem, while the payment determination is also nontrivial. The payment should be sufficient to compensate for a source device's resource cost, and meanwhile, incentivize the source to truthfully declare its private cost and budget. Modeling the problem as a reverse auction, we develop both a deterministic mechanism and a randomized mechanism, which are truthful or truthful in expectation, respectively. Both mechanisms are individually rational and subject to a computational complexity lower than that of the well-known Vickrey–Clarke–Groves mechanism or its generalized version. While the deterministic mechanism performs well in an average sense, the randomized mechanism maintains an approximation guarantee for the worst case. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms with various settings in the D2D content distribution scenario.	approximation;best, worst and average case;computational complexity theory;digital distribution;edmund m. clarke;np-hardness;numerical analysis;randomized algorithm;whole earth 'lectronic link	Yiming Zhao;Wei Song	2017	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2017.2725449	computer network;resource management;reverse auction;efficient energy use;computational complexity theory;computer science;via device;payment;interference (wave propagation);distributed computing;base station	Metrics	30.607224392173475	95.72411589512583	169145

In the group handover, a lot of users try to initiate a handover at the same time, which causes network congestion and increases the probability that the handover would be blocked. In our proposed scheme, to prevent these problems of a group handover, each user which participates in the group handover, optimally selects an access point(AP) based on the remaining resources of the AP, and each user initiates a handover after adjusted delay to prevent network congestion. To find an optimal AP selection strategy, we formulate an optimization problem whose objective is to minimize handover blocking probability, and derive an optimal solution by using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition. Through performance analysis and simulation results, we show that our proposed scheme can reduce handover blocking probability in a group handover compared to a conventional scheme and keep handover blocking probability to be less than the maximum allowable value of handover blocking probability.	access network;blocking (computing);erlang (unit);heuristic;karush–kuhn–tucker conditions;mathematical optimization;network congestion;optimization problem;profiling (computer programming);simulation;tucker decomposition	Woongsup Lee;Dong-Ho Cho	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2010.5502211	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;karush–kuhn–tucker conditions;soft handover;computer network	Mobile	26.818387404673736	93.69443624347798	169194
c72d27a9ae2a2c91ce85e5bc1cb87b9a78775fa6	quality-of-service satisfaction games for noncooperative underwater acoustic communications		Decentralized resource sharing for multiple noncooperative underwater acoustic (UWA) communication links is investigated. Point-to-point links, considered as rational players, are involved in a noncooperative game in which they compete to find a transmission strategy satisfying individual quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. Examples of UWA communication scenarios with direct-sequence-spread-spectrum and orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing systems are formulated as satisfaction games. The transmitters adapt their parameters (power, frequency, and spreading gain) autonomously and in a decentralized way, without exchanging any information. This adaptation is made possible thanks to the feedback of local information on the channel statistics provided by their receiver. A blind satisfaction response algorithm is also proposed, which requires only a 1-bit feedback. Realistic assumptions are made regarding the environment. The UWA channel is modeled as random and doubly selective, its coherence time is much shorter than the propagation delays and no assumption is made regarding its distribution. The UWA communication links do not have any prior information about the interfering waveforms of competing transmitters. Extensive numerical simulations are provided and comparisons are made with the Nash equilibrium solution. Results show gains both in terms of probability of QoS satisfaction and power consumed, even when a minimal knowledge of the environment is considered.	1-bit architecture;acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;fibre channel point-to-point;multiplexing;nash equilibrium;numerical analysis;propagation delay;quality of service;simulation;software propagation;transmitter	Antony Pottier;François-Xavier Socheleau;Christophe Laot	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2823898	computer network;resource management;quality of service;coherence time;distributed computing;computer science;shared resource;interference (wave propagation);nash equilibrium;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;communication channel	Mobile	33.38380420937515	95.56790815312362	169346

d3bd2278352545b99ac558d48d282a7f2ee583ba	user classification in crowdsourcing-based cooperative spectrum sensing		This paper studies cooperative spectrum sensing based on crowdsourcing in cognitive radio networks. Since intelligent mobile users such as smartphones and tablets can sense the wireless spectrum, channel sensing tasks can be assigned to these mobile users. This is referred to as the crowdsourcing method. However, there may be some malicious mobile users that send false sensing reports deliberately, for their own purposes. False sensing reports will influence decisions about channel state. Therefore, it is necessary to classify mobile users in order to distinguish malicious users. According to the sensing reports, mobile users should not just be divided into two classes (honest and malicious). There are two reasons for this: on the one hand, honest users in different positions may have different sensing outcomes, as shadowing, multi-path fading, and other issues may influence the sensing results; on the other hand, there may be more than one type of malicious users, acting differently in the network. Therefore, it is necessary to classify mobile users into more than two classes. Due to the lack of prior information of the number of user classes, this paper casts the problem of mobile user classification as a dynamic clustering problem that is NP-hard. The paper uses the interdistance-to-intradistance ratio of clusters as the fitness function, and aims to maximize the fitness function. To cast this optimization problem, this paper proposes a distributed algorithm for user classification in order to obtain bounded close-to-optimal solutions, and analyzes the approximation ratio of the proposed algorithm. Simulations show the distributed algorithm achieves higher performance than other algorithms.	approximation algorithm;cluster analysis;cognitive radio;computer simulation;crowdsourcing;distributed algorithm;file shadowing;fitness function;malware;mathematical optimization;np-hardness;optimization problem;perf (linux);quorum sensing;smartphone;tablet computer	Linbo Zhai;Hua Wang	2017	Symmetry	10.3390/sym9070110	fading;cognitive radio;distributed algorithm;combinatorics;cluster analysis;mathematics;data mining;distributed computing;crowdsourcing;communication channel;optimization problem;fitness function	Mobile	32.97693066086066	97.05361231278816	169522

The optimization of the operation of a mobile cloud computing system amounts to the problem of minimizing the energy required for offloading across all MUs under latency constraints at the application layer. In a scenario with multiple MUs transmitting over a shared wireless medium across multiple cells, this problem requires the management of interference for both the uplink, through which MUs offload the data needed for computation in the cloud, and for the downlink, through which the outcome of the cloud computation are fed back to the MUs, as well as the allocation of backhaul resources for communication between wireless edge and cloud and of computing resources at the cloud. In this paper, this problem is formulated for general multi-antenna, or MIMO, channels, and tackled by means of successive convex approximation methods. The numerical results illustrate the advantages of a joint allocation of computing and communication resources.	algorithm;approximation;backhaul (telecommunications);computation;computational resource;convex optimization;interference (communication);iterative method;mimo;mathematical optimization;mobile cloud computing;mobile phone;numerical analysis;numerical method;optimization problem;outline of object recognition;requirement;server (computing);telecommunications link;transmitter;video processing;virtual private server;wireless access point	Ali Najdi Al-Shuwaili;Alireza Bagheri;Osvaldo Simeone	2016	2016 Annual Conference on Information Science and Systems (CISS)	10.1109/CISS.2016.7460540	real-time computing;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	31.276962721187513	91.24641878062978	169611

It is considered a promising solution to improve communication performance and network capacity of LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) system. However, in D2D networks, the co-existence of multiple D2D User Equipments (UEs) is a challenging issue due to the proximity interference caused by collisions, especially, without a central controller. In this paper, we propose a distributed collision detection scheme, which can enhance the discovery performance. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme can significantly improve the number of detected devices by mitigating interference.	collision detection;compaq lte;interference (communication);simulation	Jongwoo Hong;Seungil Park;Sunghyun Choi	2014	2014 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)	10.1109/ICTC.2014.6983157	computer network;collision detection;computer science	HPC	25.85919288911503	89.59047687041851	169742

In particular, remote radio heads (RRHs) are connected to a central processor (CP) via capacity-limited backhaul links to facilitate CoMP joint transmission. Besides, the CP transfers energy to the RRHs for more efficient network operation. The considered resource allocation algorithm design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem with a minimum required signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint at multiple information receivers and a minimum required power transfer constraint at the energy harvesting receivers. By optimizing the transmit beamforming vectors at the CP and energy sharing between the CP and the RRHs, we aim at jointly minimizing the total network transmit power and the maximum capacity consumption per backhaul link. The resulting non-convex optimization problem is NP-hard. In light of the intractability of the problem, we reformulate it by replacing the non-convex objective function with its convex hull, which enables the derivation of an efficient iterative resource allocation algorithm. In each iteration, a non-convex optimization problem is solved by semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxation and the proposed iterative algorithm converges to a local optimal solution of the original problem. Simulation results illustrate that our proposed algorithm achieves a close-to-optimal performance and provides a significant reduction in backhaul capacity consumption compared to full cooperation. Besides, the considered CoMP network is shown to provide superior system performance as far as power consumption is concerned compared to a traditional system with multiple antennas co-located.	algorithm design;backhaul (telecommunications);beamforming;central processing unit;convex function;convex hull;convex optimization;interference (communication);iteration;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;multi-user;multipoint ground;multiuser dos;np-hardness;optimization problem;remote radio head;semiconductor industry;semidefinite programming;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation	Derrick Wing Kwan Ng;Robert Schober	2014	2014 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7037480	algorithm design;mathematical optimization;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;mathematics;wireless	EDA	36.48985995899151	90.43274987961586	170152
70bbbc5a9c50e29da1e23f237c5db43cc6327d84	sensor clustering and sensing technology for optimal throughput of sensor-aided cognitive radio networks supporting multiple licensed channels		In cognitive radio networks, secondary users may not sense licensed channels efficiently due to problems of fading channel, shadowing, unfamiliar environment, and so forth. To cope with the limitation, a pervasive sensor network can cooperate with cognitive radio network, which is called sensor-aided cognitive radio network. In the paper, we investigate sensor clustering and sensing time of each sensor cluster with aiming at achieving optimal throughput of sensor-aided cognitive radio network supporting multiple licensed channels. Moreover, the minimum throughput requirement of cognitive radio user is also guaranteed in the sensor clustering problem. To do this, we formulate the throughput maximization problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming and utilize the Branch and Bound algorithm to solve it. We also propose an heuristic algorithm which can provide similar performance to that of the Branch and Bound algorithm while reducing computation complexity significantly.	cognitive radio;throughput	Thanh Tung Nguyen;Insoo Koo	2015	IJDSN	10.1155/2015/123982	cognitive radio;cognitive network;telecommunications;distributed computing;computer network	HCI	30.136024111381438	92.36193874722608	170168

The problem is formulated as a game theoretic model in which users selfishly maximize their throughput. Unlike most existing work, we do not assume that users have complete information about the other users' dynamics, which is more realistic in a communication network with distributed users where conveying such information would create enormous overhead. To do so, we provide a simple procedure that introduces a full hierarchy among the users reflecting in an accurate way their channel quality and then allowing them to sequentially choose their preferred network. Interestingly, the result for each user in the payoff is not far from his optimum.	cell (microprocessor);game theory;load balancing (computing);overhead (computing);simulation;telecommunications network;throughput;wireless access point	Majed Haddad;Piotr Wiecek;Oussama Habachi	2018	IEEE INFOCOM 2018 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)	10.1109/INFCOMW.2018.8406908	complete information;distributed computing;telecommunications network;throughput;software;macro;nash equilibrium;stochastic game;communication channel;computer science	Mobile	30.748005346535766	94.72125307269604	170686

To achieve this target, we formulate a generalized multiobjective optimization (MOOP) problem that jointly maximizes the transmission rate of the SU and minimizes the cochannel interference (CCI) and adjacent channel interference (ACI) to existing PUs. We additionally constrain the allowed CCI and ACI to the PUs to guarantee the PUs' protection from harmful interference. The MOOP problem is solved by linearly combining the normalized competing objective functions - through weighting coefficients - into a single objective function. Prior work in the literature that maximizes the SU transmission rate can be considered as a special case of the generalized MOOP problem by setting the weighting coefficients associated with interference minimization to zero. Since estimating the full channel state information (CSI) of the links between the SU transmitter and the PU receivers is practically challenging, we assume only partial CSI knowledge of these links. Simulation results illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm and quantify the SU performance loss due to incomplete CSI knowledge. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is compared with state-of-the-art techniques, and our performance results show that the proposed algorithm is more energy aware, yet with reduced complexity.	algorithm;catastrophic interference;channel state information;coefficient;cognitive radio;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);loss function;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;multiplexing;optimization problem;simulation;superuser;transmitter	Ebrahim Bedeer;Octavia A.

In cognitive wireless network, throughput scheduling optimization under interference temperature constraints has attracted more attentions in recent years. A lot of works have been investigated on it with different scenarios. However, these solutions have either high computational complexity or relatively poor performance. Throughput scheduling is a constraint optimization problem with NP(Non-deterministic Polynomial) hard features. In this paper, we proposed an immune-clone based suboptimal algorithm to solve the problem. Suitable immune clone operators are designed such as encoding, clone, mutation and selection. The simulation results show that our proposed algorithm obtains near-optimal performance and operates with much lower computational complexity. It is suitable for slowly varying spectral environments.

This problem in its original form is non-convex and may be solved using greedy algorithms or integer linear programming (ILP) techniques. However, the computational complexity of the latter techniques is quite high, while the suboptimal greedy algorithms are not very well suited for spectrum-sharing networks because of multiple constraints on the transmitted power, interference leakage and individual user data rate. Therefore the authors propose a novel recursion-based linear optimisation framework that provides a solution that is very close to the optimal one and that has the ability to perform adaptive subcarrier, bit and power allocation for multiple users in the presence of multiple individual user constraints. Owing to the convexity of the proposed algorithm at each recursion, its overall complexity is substantially lower than that of the ILP-based solution.

It is important to allocate the appropriate resources to multi-beam downlinks to prevent the unnecessary waste of resources due to the inherent limitations of them, such as power, bandwidth, and even the use of a spot beam. In this paper, we propose a resource management technique adjusting the bandwidth of each beam, in which the difference between the traffic demand and allocated capacity is minimized. This represents a reasonable solution for flexible bandwidth allocation considering a trade-off between the maximum total capacity and fairness among the spot beams with different traffic demand. In addition, in order to improve the total system capacity, we present the flexible beam management algorithm. Meanwhile, the proposed flexible bandwidth allocation scheme does not yield a closed-form solution for the beam profile in terms of bandwidth. Therefore, we present the method to find optimal beam bandwidth via heuristic search.	algorithm;channel capacity;elegant degradation;fairness measure;form-based authentication;heuristic;proportionally fair	Unhee Park;Hee Wook Kim;Dae-Sub Oh;Bon Jun Ku	2012	2012 IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2012.6399225	bandwidth management;network traffic control;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;communications satellite;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network;bandwidth allocation	Embedded	26.726303638892993	93.53875522894919	171433

More specifically, we investigate the case of MIMO Rician fading for the eavesdropper channel. We show that the optimal input covariance has rank one, which allows us to reduce the original optimization problem to a smooth one variable optimization problem.

In the first algorithm, the transmitter derives the transmission power with PID control in order to satisfy the QoS constraints in secondary networks. The derived transmission power is compared with a constraint condition in order to avoid the interference with primary networks, and then the actual transmission power is decided. Because the constraint condition affects the performance of our proposed method significantly, we propose an effective update algorithm. On the other hand, the second algorithm is based on model predictive control (MPC). In this method, the decision of transmission power is formulated as quadratic programming (QP) problem and the transmission power is derived directly with the constraint condition. We evaluate the performances of our proposed methods with simulation and compare the proposed methods with the distributed power control (DPC) method. In numerical examples, we show that our proposed methods are more effective than the existing method in some situations. We also prove analytically that the interference with primary networks can be avoided with probability one by using our proposed method if each transmitter has the information about every channel gain. 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, we jointly optimize the base station (BS) beamforming matrix, the relay station (RS) amplify-and-forward transformation matrix, and the covariance matrix of artificial noise, so as to maximize the system worst-case secrecy rate in the presence of the colluding eavesdroppers under power constraints at the BS and the RS, as well as quality of service constraints for the legitimate users. This problem is very challenging due to the highly coupled design variables in the objective function and constraints. By adopting a series of transformation, we first derive an equivalent problem that is more tractable than the original one. Then, we propose and fully develop a novel algorithm based on the penalty concave-convex procedure (penalty-CCCP) to solve the equivalent problem, where the difficult coupled constraint is penalized into the objective and the resulting nonconvex problem is solved at each iteration by resorting to the CCCP method. It is shown that the proposed joint transceiver design algorithm converges to a stationary solution of the original problem. Finally, our simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm achieves better performance than other recently proposed transceiver designs.	algorithm;beamforming;best, worst and average case;broadcast relay station;cobham's thesis;concave function;constraint (mathematics);coupling (computer programming);iteration;loss function;mimo;malware;optimization problem;quality of service;simulation;stationary process;stationary state;telecommunications link;transceiver;transformation matrix	Yunlong Cai;Qingjiang Shi;Benoît Champagne;Geoffrey Ye Li	2017	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2708110	electronic engineering;mimo;transceiver;quality of service;telecommunications link;covariance matrix;beamforming;mathematical optimization;relay;computer science;matrix (mathematics)	Mobile	37.56106763885202	90.16772805760421	172385

The goal is to respond to the real traffic needs, while ensuring users fairness. Dynamic Cooperative Algorithms (DCA) relying on information exchange between the PCs and Non Cooperative Algorithms (DNCA) relying only on local measurements are elaborated and compared through extensive simulations. Different propagation conditions and varied resource needs between the PCs are also considered. We demonstrate in this paper the performance gain brought by the cooperative solution comparing to the non cooperative one and we show the capability of the algorithm to dynamically adjust the allocated resources to the real traffic loads.	algorithm;autonomous robot;compaq lte;fairness measure;frequency allocation;information exchange;personal computer;pico;simulation;software propagation;throughput;vergence	Véronique Capdevielle;Afef Feki;Elias Temer	2011	2011 IEEE 73rd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VETECS.2011.5956322	heuristic;shared resource;database index;spectrum;throughput;simulation;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;index term;information exchange;telecommunications;computer science;weight distribution;resource management;lte advanced;distributed computing;interference;signal-to-noise ratio;computer network	Mobile	28.12974747724665	90.66770118150819	172609
42d845f122028da7d973e16f443e36ac1b26cd40	dynamic small cell clustering and non-cooperative game-based precoding design for two-tier heterogeneous networks with massive mimo		In this paper, we investigate the dynamic small cell (SC) clustering strategy and their precoding design problem for interference coordination in two-tier heterogeneous networks (HetNets) with massive MIMO (mMIMO). To reduce interference among different SCs, an interference graph-based dynamic SC clustering scheme is proposed. Based on this, we formulate an optimization problem as design precoding weights at macro base station (MBS) and clustered SCs for maximizing the downlink sum rate of SC users (SUs) subject to the power constraint of each SC BS (SBS), while mitigating inter-cluster, eliminating inter-tier, intra-cluster and multi-macro user (MU) interference. To eliminate the inter-tier and multi-MU interference simultaneously, we propose a clustered SC block diagonalization precoding scheme for the MBS. Next, each SU’s precoding vector at clustered SCs is designed as the product of the following two parts. The first part is designed with singular value decomposition to remove the intra-cluster interference. The second part is designed to coordinate the inter-cluster interference for maximizing the downlink sum rate of SUs, which is a non-convex optimization problem and difficult to solve directly. A non-cooperative game-based distributed algorithm is proposed to obtain a suboptimal solution. Meanwhile, we prove the existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium for the formed game. Finally, simulation results verify the effectiveness of our proposed schemes.	cluster analysis;convex optimization;distributed algorithm;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;multi-user mimo;multitier architecture;nash equilibrium;optimization problem;simulation;singular value decomposition;smart battery system;telecommunications link	Wanming Hao;Osamu Muta;Haris Gacanin;Hiroshi Furukawa	2018	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2756934	non-cooperative game;electronic engineering;3g mimo;mimo;cluster analysis;computer science;telecommunications link;interference (wave propagation);precoding;optimization problem	Metrics	35.81684244823969	90.8291387548786	172872

We start from a single mobile handset assisted by a single server and then we generalize the approach to the multiuser case. In the multiuser scenario, we derive the optimal transmit power, number of bits per symbol and CPU cycles assigned to each virtual machine in order to minimize the energy consumption at each mobile user, still satisfying a computational rate constraint dictated by the application requirements. We take explicitly into account the channel random fading and provide theoretical results proving the existence of an optimal solution of the problem. Then we corroborate our theoretical findings with simulation results, showing for which classes of application and under what channel conditions, computation offloading can provide a significant performance gain.	central processing unit;computation offloading;energy minimization;mimo;mobile cloud computing;mobile phone;multi-user;requirement;server (computing);simulation;state (computer science);transceiver;virtual machine	Sergio Barbarossa;Paolo Di Lorenzo;Stefania Sardellitti	2014	2014 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)	10.1109/EuCNC.2014.6882634	real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	31.218050385128347	90.9422965734792	172882

We consider that the source node harvests energy from the environment, which is insufficient to satisfy the QoS of the users due to its random nature. We develop resource allocation schemes to minimize the dissatisfaction of the users through goal programming approach. First, we develop an offline scheme assuming that complete information about the harvested energy and channel state information (CSI) is available. The optimization problem is formulated as convex and efficient solution is provided based on dual decomposition algorithm. Next, we devise an online scheme considering the availability of causal and incomplete information about the harvested energy and CSI. We propose an algorithm based on dynamic programming to obtain the online optimal solution. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed schemes in terms of fairness and the importance of QoS provisioning in energy harvesting systems.	algorithm;causal filter;channel state information;convex function;dynamic programming;fairness measure;goal programming;lagrangian relaxation;mathematical optimization;multi-user;numerical method;online and offline;optimization problem;provisioning;quality of service	Roya Arab Loodaricheh;Shankhanaad Mallick;Vijay K.

bcbb44ac881f84b3c2b50dafc78662a96c76618f	channel allocation algorithms for co-existence of base stations in ieee 802.22 networks		The purpose of the Wireless Regional Area Networks (WRANs) is to allow the use of spectrum allocated for television broadcasting in areas with sparse users, ensuring no interference with licensed operators. Cognitive radios using the IEEE 802.22 standard should monitor the environment to not cause interference in primary operators. When multiple WRANs intend to operate on the same set of frequencies in overlapping areas, the 802.22 standard provides mechanisms for their co-existence and provides a temporal multiplexing scheme to solve this problem. We propose three channel allocation algorithms to support the co-existence of potentially interfering WRANs. The proposed algo- rithms are based on graph coloring, and the innovation is to consider the demand for bandwidth from each WRAN, maintaining proportionality between the demand for frequencies of each WRAN and what is actually allocated. The algorithms are evaluated and it is concluded that they can efficiently assign channels to WRAN taking into account the bandwidth needs of each network.		Wagner C.

ab9fc979df0b31fe3b5b73fcef2a95f8cd420d05	smart multi-rat access based on multiagent reinforcement learning		The ongoing increasing traffic in the era of big data yields unprecedented demands in user experience and network capacity expansion. The users of next generation mobile networks (5 G) should be able to use 3GPP, IEEE, and other technologies simultaneously. The integration of multiple radio access technologies (RATs) of licensed or unlicensed bands has been widely deemed as a cost-efficient way to greatly increase the network capacity. In this paper, we propose a smart aggregated RAT access (SARA) strategy with aim of maximizing the long-term network throughput while meeting diverse traffic quality of service (QoS) requirements. We consider the scenario that users with different QoS requirements access to a heterogeneous network with coexisting cellular-WiFi. In order to maximize system throughput while meeting diverse traffic QoS requirements in such a complex and dynamic environment, we exploit multiagent reinforcement learning to perform RAT selection in conjunction with resource allocation for individual user access requests, through sensing dynamic channel states and traffic QoS requirements. In SARA, we first use Nash Q-learning to provide a set of feasible RAT selection strategies while decreasing the strategy space in learning process, and then employ Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) based Q-learning to perform resource allocation. Numerical results reveal that the network throughput can be maximized while meeting various traffic QoS requirements with limited number of searches by using our proposed SARA algorithm. For bulk arrival access requests, a suboptimal solution can be obtained as high computational complexity is incurred for achieving global optimality. Another attractive feature of SARA is that a tradeoff between the solution optimality and learning time can be readily made by terminating the search of MCTS according to the time constraint. Compared with traditional WiFi offloading schemes, SARA can significantly improve network throughput while guaranteeing traffic QoS requirements.	agent-based model;algorithm;big data;computational complexity theory;cost efficiency;monte carlo method;monte carlo tree search;nash equilibrium;newman's lemma;next-generation network;q-learning;quality of service;reinforcement learning;requirement;throughput;user experience	Mu Yan;Gang Feng;Jianhong Zhou;Shuang Qin	2018	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2018.2793186	computer network;throughput;quality of service;next generation mobile networks;resource management;heterogeneous network;reinforcement learning;monte carlo tree search;computer science;resource allocation	Mobile	30.984583892969283	96.49858155185778	173497

The robustness is defined with respect to imperfect knowledge of the channel at the transmitter. The errors in the channel state information are assumed to be bounded, and certain quality-of-service targets in terms of mean-square errors (MSEs) are guaranteed for all channels from the uncertainty regions. Iterative algorithms are proposed for the transceiver design. The iterations perform alternating optimization of the transmitter and the receivers and have equivalent semidefinite programming representations with efficient numerical solutions. The framework supports robust counterparts of several MSE-optimization problems, including transmit power minimization with per-user or per-stream MSE constraints, sum MSE minimization, min-max fairness, etc. Although the convergence to the global optimum cannot be claimed due to the intricacy of the problems, numerical examples show good practical performance of the presented methods. We also provide various possibilities for extensions in order to accommodate a broader set of scenarios regarding the precoder structure, the uncertainty modeling, and a multicellular setup.	algorithm;channel state information;decision theory;fairness measure;global optimization;iteration;mimo-ofdm;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;multi-user mimo;numerical analysis;quality of service;semidefinite programming;telecommunications link;transceiver;transmitter	Nikola Vucic;Holger Boche;Shuying Shi	2008	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/ICC.2008.661	optimization problem;mathematical optimization;telecommunications;computer science;base station;control theory;mathematics;mean squared error;iterative method;channel capacity;transceiver;satisfiability	Visualization	38.03532619743782	89.51903621801353	173570

Among various CoMP schemes, coherent joint transmission scheme (CJT) shows the largest CoMP gains in both cell average performance and cell edge performance. However, for pursuit of the upper bound of CoMP gains, centralized scheduling was adopted in those proposed CJT schemes. With CoMP cluster size increasing, those proposed CoMP schemes face multiple severe challenges, such as the unacceptable computational complexity and more strict latency requirements. In this paper, a novel CJT scheme is proposed, which is based on distributed scheduling and joint transmit precoder design. The complexity of the new CJT scheme is theoretically analyzed and compared with that of centralized scheduling CJT schemes. Moreover, comprehensive performance evaluations of the new CJT scheme are performed by system level simulations in various transmission scenarios. Taking the performance of non-CoMP scheme as baseline, the new CJT scheme can achieve over 35% cell average gain and over 32% cell edge gain, although there is around 10% cell edge CoMP gain loss than that of centralized scheduling CJT scheme.	baseline (configuration management);best, worst and average case;centralized computing;coherence (physics);compaq lte;computational complexity theory;polynomial-time approximation scheme;requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation;telecommunications link	Huan Sun;Haiyang Zhang;Tao Yang;Yong Liu	2015	2015 IEEE 26th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2015.7343399	job shop scheduling;real-time computing;telecommunications link;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;interference	Mobile	30.950869612162244	89.46966406572393	174198

The proximity-based service includes a variety of services exploiting the location information of user equipment (UE), for example, the mobile social network and the mobile marketing. To realize the proximity-based service in the LTE-A system, it is necessary to design a D2D discovery scheme by which UE can discover another UE in its proximity. We design a D2D discovery scheme based on the random access procedure in the LTE-A system. The proposed random-access-based D2D discovery scheme is advantageous in that 1) the proposed scheme can be readily applied to the current LTE-A system without significant modification; 2) the proposed scheme discovers pairs of UE in a centralized manner, which enables the access or core network to centrally control the formation of D2D communication networks; and 3) the proposed scheme adaptively allocates resource blocks for the D2D discovery to prevent underutilization of radio resources. We analyze the performance of the proposed D2D discovery scheme. A closed-form formula for the performance is derived by means of the stochastic geometry-based approach. We show that the analysis results accurately match the simulation results.	centralized computing;compaq lte;mobile social network;random access;simulation;telecommunications link;telecommunications network	Kae Won Choi;Zhu Han	2015	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2014.2369591	radio access network;database index;telecommunications link;mobile telephony;global positioning system;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;service discovery;mobile computing;world wide web;access network discovery and selection function;computer network	Mobile	27.929223072457773	91.16509706836192	174461

On the other hand, users with good SINR conditions are served via multiuser MIMO by a single base station (BS). The proposed scheme uses a joint zero-forcing beamforming with semi-orthogonal user selection (ZFBF-SUS) transmission along with optimized power allocation in a semi-distributed manner to maximize the overall system energy efficiency (i.e., the average data rate per unit power [bps/Watt], or equivalently, average number of successfully transmitted bits per energy unit [bit/Joule]).

In this work, we consider the problem of maximizing the weighted sum-rate of a wireless cellular network via coordinated scheduling and discrete power control. We present two distributed iterative algorithms which require limited information exchange and data processing at each base station. Both algorithms provably converge to a solution where no base station can unilaterally modify its status (i.e., transmit power and user selection) to improve the weighted sum-rate of the network. Numerical studies are carried out to assess the performance of the proposed schemes in a realistic system based on the IEEE 802.16m specifications. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms achieve a significant rate gain over uncoordinated transmission strategies for both cell-edge and inner users.	binary logarithm;converge;distributed algorithm;expectation–maximization algorithm;human body weight;information exchange;interference (communication);iteration;linear algebra;markov chain;multi-user;next-generation network;numerical method;p (complexity);randomized algorithm;scheduling (computing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;software deployment;spectral efficiency;weight function	Honghai Zhang;Luca Venturino;Narayan Prasad;Peilong Li;Sampath Rangarajan;Xiaodong Wang	2011	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2011.110609	algorithm design;cellular network;distributed algorithm;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;base station;operating system;markov process;computer network	Mobile	32.143839794895264	91.0864190428837	174890

Secondary users (SUs) connect to SAPs according to their preferences. A key feature of the proposed model is that it permits SAPs to set discriminatory powers for SUs, i.e., SUs in different locations will be scheduled with different transmission powers. Profit-maximizing SAPs compete with each other by setting locations and delivered power schedules to attract SUs, taking into account the impact of the revenue obtained and the power cost incurred. To study this competitive situation, an appropriate extensive form game is defined. The game can be viewed as two-staged. The selection of transmission powers by SAPs can be investigated for each pair of locations. Then, the problem of location choice can be analyzed, anticipating what transmission powers will be chosen. We make an important observation: The Nash equilibrium of the game exists, and the global revenue maximum strategy is a Nash equilibrium strategy. Finally, we explore the equilibrium for a circular region having uniform SU distribution and illustrate how to locate SAPs for such a region.	cognitive radio;nash equilibrium;schedule (computer science);wireless access point	Dapeng Li;Wei Zhong;Qingjiang Shi;Haitao Zhao;Bo Huang	2012	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2012.2196772	cognitive radio;simulation;computer science;resource management;material requirements planning;computer network	ECom	29.981266927467384	95.28718243433292	174917

One of the key challenges to the success of hierarchical cellular systems is to manage the intercell interference between the macrocell and the microcell and to maximize the spectrum efficiency. In this paper, antenna beamforming, power allocation, and multiuser scheduling are jointly designed to opportunistically utilize the macrocell's uplink spectrum in serving multiple secondary microcellular users concurrently. The joint design of antenna beamforming, power allocation, and scheduling with the objective of maximizing the sum rate is indeed a mixed-integer nonlinear programming NP-hard problem. The proposed simpler iterative subgradient projection and semidefinite programming approach can obtain better performance than the conventional zero-forcing beamforming. Furthermore, unlike the optimal singular value decomposition (SVD) beamforming that requires all users to have channel knowledge at the receiver for cooperation, the proposed joint design methodology requires no channel knowledge at the receiver and can outperform the SVD beamforming without user scheduling. When considering both implementation complexity and performance enhancement issues, the proposed joint power allocation, multiuser scheduling, and antenna beamforming technique can help provide important insights into the design of interference management techniques for hierarchical CR systems.	beamforming;cognitive radio;interference (communication);iterative method;multi-user;np-hardness;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;scheduling (computing);semidefinite programming;singular value decomposition;spectral efficiency;subgradient method;telecommunications link	Meng-Lin Ku;Li-Chun Wang;Yu-Lung Liu	2015	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2014.2361083	real-time computing;telecommunications;resource management;antenna;interference;signal-to-noise ratio	Mobile	35.29104734432108	90.46525116247767	175489

In order for the CR users to opportunistically utilize the spectrum in absence of primary users (PUs), a reliable cooperative spectrum sensing scheme should be employed to assure service quality for the PUs as well as spectrum accessibility for the CRs. In this paper, a hybrid soft-hard decision fusion scheme of cooperative sensing is proposed. The hybridization of soft-hard fusion is realized by means of two-stage hierarchical clustering to jointly exploit the advantages of soft and hard fusion schemes. Through computer simulations, the proposed cooperation scheme is proven to have promising overall balanced-performance. However, it has been also shown that the overall performance of the CR network would be very much dependent on some existing tradeoffs between detection reliability and radio resources.	accessibility;cluster analysis;cognitive radio;computer simulation;evolutionary algorithm;geographic coordinate system;hierarchical data format;hierarchical clustering;modulation;one-class classification;relay;sensor	Ayman A.

9599bfebb03894cd139600e81f9382e1bd461739	a novel adaptive spectrum allocation scheme for multi-channel multi-radio wireless mesh networks	network coding;scheduling;期刊论文;multicast;channel assignment	The rapidly developed wireless services and applications have an increasing demand of spectrum resource, which is actually limited. Therefore, how to allocate spectrum resource effectively for network throughput improvement is an urgent issue. Although the utilization of spectrum can be enhanced by link scheduling for spatial reuse, Network Coding (NC) for broadcast transmission, multicast transmission and multi-channel multi-radio techniques, their interactions cannot be ignored. This is because on one hand, the achieved network performance by NC is strongly dependent on the MAC layer, and greedy NC method may in fact reduce network throughput owing to the reduction of spectrum spatial reuse. On the other hand, channel assignment faces more challenges brought by NC and multicast transmission since the broadcast or multicast links are dominated by the link with the worst channel state. In order to utilize the spectrum resource adaptively while not bringing additional constraints, we present a twophase solution approach. On the first step, we formulate the NC-aware scheduling scheme to an optimization problem, by which the interference-free links are allocated into the same link set and can be activated in the same time slot and channel. Then, we assign different channels to the link sets according to the radio constraints in a heuristic method, which can further increase the utilization of spectrum resource. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method can largely increase the utilization of spectrum resource and improve network throughput. & 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, the CNC schedules resources over time for the mobile terminals (MTs) based on the value functions sent by the WSPs. While the strategic WSPs compete against each other on behalf of their MTs to optimize the long-term expected payoffs. The interactions among WSPs under a temporally changing SoftRAN form a non-cooperative stochastic game, which is regulated by the CNC using a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves pricing mechanism. However, due to the selfishness of WSPs, global network information is unattainable during the interacting process. We hence propose a stochastic resource scheduling scheme, in which each WSP needs neither other WSPs' private information nor a priori knowledge of network dynamics, yet it is able to independently learn the approximated true value functions in a gradual way. Numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the performance gains that can be achieved from the proposed scheme.	approximation algorithm;centralized computing;computational fluid dynamics;edmund m. clarke;global network;interaction;network interface controller;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;personally identifiable information;polynomial-time approximation scheme;radio access network;scheduling (computing);simulation	Xianfu Chen;Zhu Han;Honggang Zhang;Mehdi Bennis;Tao Chen	2015	2015 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)	10.1109/GlobalSIP.2015.7418170	simulation;computer science;radio resource management;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	30.27970701764908	95.16574540696885	177357
9a10d2736536e8dc0c4d83b0dffcce44d18ac891	optimal throughput fairness tradeoffs for downlink non-orthogonal multiple access over fading channels		Recently, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has attracted considerable interest as one of the 5G-enabling techniques. However, the users with better channel conditions in downlink communications intrinsically benefit more from NOMA than the users with worse channel conditions thanks to successive decoding, judicious designs are required to guarantee user fairness. In this paper, a two-user downlink NOMA system over fading channels is considered. For delay-tolerant transmission, the average sum rate is maximized subject to both average and peak-power constraints as well as a minimum average user rate constraint. The optimal resource allocation is obtained using the Lagrangian dual decomposition under full channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), while an effective power allocation policy under partial CSIT is also developed based on analytical results. In parallel, for delay-limited transmission, the sum of delay-limited throughput (DLT) is maximized subject to a maximum allowable user outage constraint under full CSIT, and the analysis for the sum of DLT is also performed under partial CSIT. Furthermore, an optimal orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme is also studied as a benchmark to prove the superiority of NOMA over OMA under full CSIT. Finally, the theoretical analysis is verified by simulations via different tradeoffs for the average sum rate (sum-DLT) versus the minimum (maximum) average user rate (outage) requirement.	benchmark (computing);channel state information;dlt;downtime;ergodicity;expectation–maximization algorithm;fairness measure;lagrangian relaxation;numerical analysis;oma;simulation;telecommunications link;throughput;time-sharing;transmitter	Hong Xing;Yuanawei Liu;Arumugam Nallanathan;Zhiguo Ding;H.

Recently, many technological issues, such as resource allocation and interference mitigation pertaining to cognitive small cell network have been studied, but most studies focus on maximizing spectral efficiency. Different from the existing works, we investigate the power control and sensing time optimization problem in a cognitive small cell network, where the cross-tier interference mitigation, imperfect hybrid spectrum sensing, and energy efficiency are considered. The optimization of energy efficient sensing time and power allocation is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem. We solve the proposed problem in an asymptotically optimal manner. An iterative power control algorithm and a near optimal sensing time scheme are developed by considering imperfect hybrid spectrum sensing, cross-tier interference mitigation, minimum data rate requirement, and energy efficiency. Simulation results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for energy efficient resource allocation in the cognitive small cell network.

The heuristic algorithm proposed in this paper outperforms the general random matching algorithm with respect to the expected number of handovers and handover probability fairness. Also, the spectrum hole reservation algorithm minimizes service dropping while using optimum amount of resource, and it realizes seamless service by eliminating delay generated due to spectrum change. Performance analysis and computer simulations validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.

db7a9d371e86791278836d14a8fd229b12d32ed1	two-stage channel assignment scheme in wireless networks	wireless networks;wireless network;channel assignment	This paper presents a new channel assignment scheme that efficiently improves the spatial frequency– spectrum reuse in a wireless network with heterogeneous demands, in which the cells are partitioned into a lot of clusters. Since the channel demands of each cell are different, this scheme adopts two stages to effectively assign channels. In the first stage, the cluster-based scheme allocates a number of channels to the cells of each cluster for satisfying the requirement of co-channel reuse. The channel demand of majority cells will be satisfied in this stage. In the second stage, when the channel requirement of most cells has been fulfilled, the tree-based assignment scheme allocates channels for the minority cells, which are still lacking of channels. Simulation results showed that the proposed scheme is superior to the previous schemes.

In our earlier work [1], we proved that for transceivers operating under a total power constraint, the maximum sum rate occurs at the boundary of the feasible set formed by the hyper plane representing the power constraint. This finding is nontrivial considering that we are dealing with an interference limited system. In this paper, we study the convex structure of the sum rate on the boundary of the power constraint hyper plane. For two transceivers, we prove that the sum rate is always convex on the line created by the power constraint equality. In the case of three transceivers, we identify a region in the middle of the plane created by the power constraint equality, where the sum rate is concave. This is significant because it is in the middle of the boundary plane that the power allocation can be expected to be fair to all three users. We also provide a power allocation protocol and an algorithm that distribute the power among the transceivers with fairness. Simulation results are provided to support the theorems proven in the paper as well as to demonstrate the convergence of the algorithm to the global maximum sum rate. Results of the algorithm are compared with solutions based on Game theory.	algorithm;concave function;convex optimization;fairness measure;feasible region;frequency band;game theory;interference (communication);maxima and minima;simulation;transceiver	Kandasamy Illanko;Alagan Anpalagan;Dimitrios Androutsos	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/icc.2011.5962574	communications protocol;mathematical optimization;transmitter;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;mathematics;interference;transceiver	Robotics	34.00118725175925	93.17583348329454	178303

A general system model with a multi-antenna eavesdropper and a multi-antenna full-duplex receiver is considered. In particular, we perform joint beamforming and artificial noise optimization in an effort to maximize the achievable secrecy rate. The optimization is performed in the presence of artificial noise generated by both transmitter and legitimate receiver. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex and difficult to solve. We develop a minorization-maximization algorithm to solve the problem. It is iterative in nature and guaranteed to converge to a locally optimal solution. The results can therefore be used to benchmark existing methods.

Specially, spectrum underlay systems assign licensed bandwidth to a secondary network while guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS) for a primary network. In this paper, we consider downlink CR underlay multiple-input single-output (MISO) networks comprising primary and secondary transmitters serving multiple user. In particular, we formulate the following beamforming optimization problems: 1) total transmit power minimization problem; 2) mean-square error balancing problem; and 3) network interference power minimization problem. In the presence of perfect channel state information (CSI), we formulate the optimization algorithms in a centralized manner and determine the optimal beamformers using standard convex optimization techniques.
