e6c61411e952e69b22799d91df88a20a0b7f668a	method for detection of airborne ues based on lte radio measurements		Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are expected to be connected through cellular networks. As the radio characteristics are different for airborne UEs compared to terrestrial UEs, it is beneficial to identify whether a UE is airborne (on a UAV) or on the ground, such that interference and mobility management can be optimized for UAVs separately from terrestrial UEs. In this paper, we present a classification algorithm using existing LTE UE radio measurements to identify whether a UE is airborne or terrestrial. The method is verified with LTE measurements made in a rural area at different heights, including terrestrial measurements and it is shown that the method in 3 out of the 4 different measurement cases can detect a UE to be airborne with 99% likelihood, while the fourth case still can classify a UE correctly in 95% of the cases. The right classification can further be improved by taking multiple consecutive samples into account before making a classification decision.	aerial photography;airborne ranger;algorithm;compaq lte;interference (communication);statistical classification;terrestrial television;unmanned aerial vehicle;user experience	Jeroen Wigard;Rafhael Amorim;Huan Cong Nguyen;István Z.

However, for an optimal operation of these techniques, channel state information (CSI) must be available in both the transmitter and receiver sides. In this paper, an exact closed-form expression for the bit error rate (BER) in MIMOOFDM systems with transmit beamforming and maximal ratio combining (MRC) reception is obtained, under imperfect channel prediction and interpolation, in multipath Rayleigh fading. This expression is used to evaluate the BER performance of the system for different antenna configurations, prediction and interpolation filters, and channel conditions.	beamforming;bit error rate;channel state information;elementary function;frequency divider;global communications conference;mimo;mimo-ofdm;maximal set;multipath propagation;multiplexing;rayleigh fading;sinc filter;sinc function;subject matter expert turing test;throughput;transmitter;whittaker–shannon interpolation formula;wiener filter;x.690	F.

The synchronization is achieved using training symbols which are simultaneously transmitted from transmit antennas. The training symbols are directly modulatable orthogonal polyphase sequences. The synchronization algorithm shows satisfactory performance even at a low SNR and in a frequency selective channel. The training sequence structure is specialized such that channel parameters in terms of channel coefficients and noise variance can be estimated once synchronization is achieved.	algorithm;coefficient;mimo;polyphase quadrature filter;signal-to-noise ratio	Apurva N.

In this framework, there is perfect and instantaneous CSIT from a subset of users and delayed CSIT from the remaining users. We present new results on the sum degrees of freedom (DoF) of the 3-user MISO BC with hybrid CSIT. In particular, for the case of 2 transmit antennas, we show that with perfect CSIT from one user and delayed CSIT from the remaining two users, the optimal sum DoF is 5/3. For the case of 3 transmit antennas and the same hybrid CSIT setting, it is shown that a higher sum DoF of 9/5 is achievable and this result improves upon the best known bound. Furthermore, with 3 transmit antennas, and the hybrid CSIT setting in which there is perfect CSIT from two users and delayed CSIT from the third one, a novel scheme is presented which achieves 9/4 sum DoF. Our results also reveal new insights on how to utilize hybrid channel knowledge for multi-user scenarios.	channel state information;multi-user;scenario (computing);system analysis;transmitter	SaiDhiraj Amuru;Ravi Tandon;Shlomo Shamai	2014	2014 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2014.6875211	telecommunications	Mobile	36.098338737091254	73.44532818488096	18099

We use extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart analysis to deduce the mutual information variation in LDPC iterative decoding during the SI refinement process. The objective is to obtain the same decoding quality under lower coding rates.

The decoding complexity with these models is linear with the sequence length. The aggregation parameter controls the tradeoff between decoding performance and complexity. It is shown that close-to-optimal decoding performance can be obtained with low values of the aggregation parameter, that is, with a complexity which is significantly reduced with respect to optimal QA bit/symbol models. The choice of the aggregation parameter depends on the synchronization recovery properties of the QA codes. This paper thus describes a method to estimate the probability mass function (PMF) of the gain/loss of symbols following a single bit error (i.e., of the difference between the number of encoded and decoded symbols). The entropy of the gain/loss turns out to be the average amount of information conveyed by a length constraint on both the optimal and aggregated state models. This quantity allows us to choose the value of the aggregation parameter that will lead to close-to-optimal decoding performance. It is shown that the optimum position for the length constraint is not the last time instant of the decoding process. This observation leads to the introduction of a new technique for robust decoding of QA codes with redundancy which turns out to outperform techniques based on the concept of forbidden symbol.	bit error rate;bitstream;code;complexity;decoding methods;redundancy (engineering);software quality assurance;vlc media player	Simon Malinowski;Hervé Jégou;Christine Guillemot	2008	EURASIP J.

By combining power control and multi-relays selection with LOC adjustment, our schemes aim at providing higher QoS and extending network lifetime. We consider the TDMA based scenario where one node acts as the source and the other nodes can be selected as relay nodes in a time slot and each node is limited by separate power constraint. Firstly, we build an optimization model for minimizing and balancing the energy consumption under QoS constrains. After that, when the LOC is constant, a closed form optimal solution is got by KKT conditions, which results in a dynamic resource allocation strategy. Moreover, based on solution for the fixed LOC, a suboptimal scheme is further proposed for a variable LOC via one dimension searching. The simulation results show that our schemes can improve network QoS and prolong network lifetime dramatically comparing with other existing cooperative resource allocation schemes.	altered level of consciousness;augmented lagrangian method;cooperative multitasking;experiment;gradient;karush–kuhn–tucker conditions;lagrange multiplier;lagrangian (field theory);mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;parallax sx;quality of service;relay;requirement;simulation;source lines of code;xs (perl)	Yan Zhang;Min Sheng;Jiandong Li;Ye Tian;Junliang Yao;Di Tang	2009	2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917868	mathematical optimization;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;time division multiple access;computer network	Embedded	33.819351819173164	88.06173312685127	18253

The optimal rules (in a maximum likelihood sense) are derived, approximations to them that are computationally easier to implement are identified, and upper bounds on the synchronization probability are obtained. It is seen that the high SNR rules have a performance nearly equal to that of the ML rules, but provide a significant performance improvement over the simple correlation rules and are virtually as simple to implement for a wide range of signal energies. We also address the problem of designing periodic MPPM synchronization sequences with good autocorrelation properties, based on a maximum, worst case, peak-to-sidelobe distance criterion. Upper bounds on the peak-to-sidelobe distance for such sequences are derived, and a few sequences, generated by computer simulations, for different synchronization sequence lengths are given. { {eywwdsSynchronization, Multi-pulse PPM	algorithm;approximation;autocorrelation;best, worst and average case;computer simulation;modulation;signal-to-noise ratio;synchronization (computer science)	Ramaiah Velidi;Costas N.

However, as OQAM-based FBMC is based on real orthogonality, transmission over a complex-valued channel makes the decoding process more challenging compared to CP-OFDM case. Moreover, if we apply Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) techniques to OQAM-based FBMC, the decoding schemes are different from the ones used in CP-OFDM. In this paper, we consider the combination of OQAM-based FBMC with single delay Space-Time Trellis Coding (STTC). We extend the decoding process presented earlier in the case of Nt = 2 transmit antennas to greater values of Nt. Then, for Nt ≥ 2, we make an analysis of the theoretical and simulation performance of ML and Viterbi decoding. Finally, to improve the performance of this method, we suggest an iterative decoding method. We show that the OQAM-based FBMC iterative decoding scheme can slightly outperform CP-OFDM.	frequency divider;iterative method;mimo;mimo-ofdm;modulation;multiplexing;simulation;trellis quantization;viterbi decoder;windows nt	Chrislin Lélé;Didier Le Ruyet	2010	EURASIP J.

A high pathloss is generally expected for channels with rich scattering, suggesting that a high SNR and rich multipath are competing goals. The current work investigates this issue based on measurements obtained with a 16 times 32 MIMO channel sounder for the 5.8 GHz band. The measurements were carried out in various indoor scenarios where different sizes of both the transmitter and receiver antenna arrays are investigated, 1 times 1 up to 16 times 32. A moderate correlation between pathloss and median capacity was found. However, the higher richness can not compensate for the decrease in capacity due to increased pathloss. Assuming a fixed Tx power, the median capacity was found to depend approximately linearly on the pathloss. The slope of the linear relation depends on the effective rank of the channel, which in turn was found to be approximately linearly dependent on the number of antennas, assuming a symmetric MIMO channel	channel capacity;mimo;multipath propagation;rx microcontroller family;rich internet application;signal-to-noise ratio;transmitter	Jesper Ødum Nielsen;Jørgen Bach Andersen;Gerhard Bauch;Markus Herdin	2006	2006 IEEE 17th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2006.253925	telecommunications;computer science;signal-to-noise ratio	Networks	26.221947857329884	79.82198515905745	18429

In this paper, we make a complementary observation. In the presence of the log-normal shadowing of sufficiently high variance, the statistics of the propagation loss of a single user with respect to different network stations are invariant with respect to their geographic positioning, whether regular or not, for a wide class of empirically homogeneous networks. Even in a perfectly hexagonal case they appear as though they were realized in a Poisson network model, i.e., form an inhomogeneous Poisson point process on the positive half-line with a power-law density characterized by the path-loss exponent. At the same time, the conditional distances to the corresponding base stations, given their observed propagation losses, become independent and log-normally distributed, which can be seen as a decoupling between the real and model geometry. The result applies also to the Suzuki (Rayleigh-log-normal) propagation model. We use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to empirically study the quality of the Poisson approximation and use it to build a linear-regression method for the statistical estimation of the value of the path-loss exponent.	approximation;coupling (computer programming);estimation theory;network model;point process;rayleigh–ritz method;software propagation	Bartlomiej Blaszczyszyn;Mohamed Kadhem Karray;Holger Paul Keeler	2015	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2015.2420099	stochastic geometry models of wireless networks;random variable;mathematical optimization;convergence;telecommunications;computer science;base station;mathematics;shadow mapping;wireless;statistics;computer network	ML	28.60250039688864	84.18587970304364	18497

Various techniques used to achieve antenna beam steering are described and compared. Measured comparisons of meteor burst performance with and without antenna beam steering are given. To demonstrate an application of beam steering, a meteor burst system with 10 times the throughput performance of any previous meteor burst system, and with sufficient capacity to provide interactive voice communication, is also described. I. METHODS OF BEAM STEERING FOR MEEOR BURST COMMUNICATION Meteor burst is a long range (1000 km) beyond line of sight communication technique which depends on scatter from the ionized trails of meteors ablating in the middle atmosphere. The number of meteors observed by a link depends on both the link power budget (the gain of the receive and transmit antennas) and the region of sky which is illuminated by the receiver-transmitter antenna pattern. In design of a meteor burst system, a compromise must be made between illuminating wide areas of sky with lowgain antennas versus focusing high-gain beam into the most active meteor regions. An additional complicating factor is the existence of regions of high activity called """"hot spots"""" [I] which move in the sky relative to the link geometry with time of day and season. Historically, the general philosophy used in meteor burst system design, has been to use relatively broad antenna beams at both ends of the link to illuminate as much of the sky region visible to both links [2,3]. Using this approach, antennas with gains on the order of approximately 10 dBi (not including ground reflection) with the corresponding vertical and horizontal beamwidths of approximately 600 and 90"""" respectively. Single Yagi type antennas with between 3 and 9 elements have been the antennas of choice for conventional meteor burst link. At low VHF frequencies used for meteor burst (40-1 00 MHz, 7-3 meters wavelength), the primary limitation on gain of antennas is the size which is driven by the wave1 engt h.

More specifically, subframe based sequential decoding is employed to yield some combinations of energy/information/mixed combining, in conjunction with the random codeset for encoding and reencoding at source and multiple UE relays, depending on their channel conditions. These additional features existing in the M-DDF circumvent the need of directly exchanging control messages between multiple relays and end user, which is not allowed for type-2 UE relays. Further, the early termination of decoding at end user in conjuction with overhearing mechanism as an additional benefit due to the increased data rate is made available for a considerable resource saving. Finally, the hybrid-adaptive modulation (H-AM) mechanism combined with overhearing mechanism can be adopted to further improve the spectral efficiency.	character encoding;compaq lte;direction finding;disk data format;distribution frame;modulation;relay;sequential decoding;spectral efficiency;uncompressed video	Sung Sik Nam;Dong In Kim;Hanbyul Seo;Byoung-Hoon Kim	2012	2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)	10.1109/ICCChina.2012.6356993	communications protocol;real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;link adaptation;telecommunications;sequential decoding;computer science;fading;computer network;modulation	Mobile	34.058749829194	76.54824677302062	18579

The interleavers designed according to these algorithms can be shortened, in order to support different block lengths in such a way that all the permutations obtained by pruning, when employed in a parallel turbo decoder, are collision-free. The first technique, suitable for short and medium interleavers, guarantees the same performance of nonparallel interleavers in terms of spreading properties, simulated frame-error probabilities, and obtainable minimum distance of the actual codes. The second algorithm, to be used for large block lengths, permits achieving high degrees of parallelism at the price of a slight degradation of the spread properties, and also to change the degree of parallelism on-the-fly. The operations of a parallel turbo decoder employing these interleavers are described, and an example of the advantages of the proposed techniques is provided in a realistic system framework.	algorithm;concatenated error correction code;concatenation;degree of parallelism;elegant degradation;forward error correction;parallel computing	Libero Dinoi;Sergio Benedetto	2004	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/GLOCOM.2004.1378924	block code;concatenated error correction code;turbo equalizer;turbo code;convolutional code;parallel computing;real-time computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;bcjr algorithm;tornado code;linear code;error floor;reed–solomon error correction;statistics	EDA	43.780241003792256	62.3155998297818	18628

In order to avoid any jitter floor irrespective of the selected modulation scheme, a filter with very particular properties has been developed and placed in parallel to the receiver matched filter. Nevertheless, the jitter performance of this method degrades in case the carrier frequency offset does not vanish. Therefore, joint synchronization of symbol timing and carrier frequency will be studied in the current paper, based on the dual-filter framework developed in some previous works. To this end, we introduce a very simple frequency error detector, which is analyzed in terms of open-loop characteristic (S-curve) and jitter variance, forming this way the ground for joint recovery.	algorithm;baseband;carrier frequency offset;cross-correlation;esa;error detection and correction;interference (communication);matched filter;modulation;monte carlo method;noise reduction;noise shaping;nonlinear system;prototype;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;vanish (computer science);zero crossing	Wilfried Gappmair;Harald Schlemmer;Alberto Ginesi	2016	2016 8th Advanced Satellite Multimedia Systems Conference and the 14th Signal Processing for Space Communications Workshop (ASMS/SPSC)	10.1109/ASMS-SPSC.2016.7601537	electronic engineering;real-time computing;jitter;telecommunications;computer science	Robotics	51.21832330480362	78.40720315865158	18647

MmWave systems must therefore leverage large antenna arrays, made possible by the decrease in wavelength, to combat pathloss with beamforming gain. Beamforming with multiple data streams, known as precoding, can be used to further improve mmWave spectral efficiency. Both beamforming and precoding are done digitally at baseband in traditional multi-antenna systems. The high cost and power consumption of mixed-signal devices in mmWave systems, however, make analog processing in the RF domain more attractive. This hardware limitation restricts the feasible set of precoders and combiners that can be applied by practical mmWave transceivers. In this paper, we consider transmit precoding and receiver combining in mmWave systems with large antenna arrays. We exploit the spatial structure of mmWave channels to formulate the precoding/combining problem as a sparse reconstruction problem. Using the principle of basis pursuit, we develop algorithms that accurately approximate optimal unconstrained precoders and combiners such that they can be implemented in low-cost RF hardware. We present numerical results on the performance of the proposed algorithms and show that they allow mmWave systems to approach their unconstrained performance limits, even when transceiver hardware constraints are considered.	approximation algorithm;baseband;basis pursuit;beamforming;channel state information;detection theory;feasible region;mimo;matching pursuit;microwave;mixed-signal integrated circuit;numerical analysis;partial template specialization;quantization (signal processing);radio frequency;reconstruction conjecture;sparse matrix;spectral efficiency;transceiver;zero-forcing precoding	Omar El Ayach;Sridhar Rajagopal;Shadi Abu-Surra;Zhouyue Pi;Robert W.

ead891547c86a1b5862eebd567694f339b02a9bb	research on a kind of optimization scheme of mimo-ofdm sphere equalization technology for unmanned aerial vehicle wireless image transmission data link system		While unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is in the mission, the acquired big data information needs to communicate in real-time with the base. Consequently, how to achieve a high-speed and high-quality data transmission via the limited bandwidth and frequency spectrum resource has currently become a hot researching topic in the field of wireless communication and aeronautical telemetry. Aiming at these problems, in this paper, we present a kind of optimization scheme of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) sphere equalization technology for UAV wireless image transmission data link system, which combines MIMO technology with OFDM technology, thus to increase the spectrum utilization rate and to improve the system performance while resisting to the multipath effect. What’s more, by means of carrying out the collaborative optimization on the original sphere equalization technology (OSET), and by the introduction of the support of the configurable parameters, the system computational complexity is significantly reduced, the detection efficiency as well as the adaptability to complex environment is also improved. Simulation experiment results demonstrate that our method has an approximately optimal bit error rate (BER) performance, a high bandwidth efficiency, a good robustness, a fast convergence rate, and the comprehensive performance is greatly improved than OSET. Furthermore, our method also has a very important reference significance and application value to the development of the equalization technologies of the wireless image transmission data link system based on the UAV platform in our country, as well as to the researches in domestic and foreign related fields.	aerial photography;mimo;mimo-ofdm;unmanned aerial vehicle	Jian Zhao;Hengzhu Liu;Xucan Chen;Botao Zhang;Ting Chen	2014		10.1007/978-3-662-44491-7_19	control engineering;simulation;telecommunications;engineering	Robotics	46.44581957415498	84.78692493574427	18813

The relay node is energy constrained and harvests energy from the radio frequency (RF) signal of the source node. The RF signal also carries information from the source to be forwarded via the relay to a destination in the presence of interference from unknown sources. We study the performance of three relaying protocols, the time switching relaying (TSR) protocol, the power splitting relaying (PSR) protocol and a proposed hybrid TSR-PSR protocol. Analytical expressions for the outage probability and throughput in the delay-sensitive transmission mode are derived for the three protocols. Using the derived expressions, we compare the throughput performances of these protocols. Our results demonstrate that the throughput of the hybrid protocol is generally higher than that of TSR and PSR protocols.	computer simulation;direction finding;downtime;interference (communication);numerical linear algebra;performance;radio frequency;relay;throughput;traffic sign recognition	Lina Elmorshedy;Cyril Leung;Seyed A.

A channel dependent intra-cell spectrum partitioning solution is proposed. According to this solution, the mean values of the signal-to-interference-ratio on respective sets of links are taken into account to determine the bandwidths assigned to base station (BS)-FRN links, FRN-mobile terminal (MT) links and BS-MT links. Moreover, by combining above intra-cell spectrum partitioning solution with different inter-cell interference management approaches, we propose three concrete frequency planning schemes, i.e. the cell-partitioning based scheme, the virtual-sector based scheme and the virtual sector enhanced cell-partitioning based scheme. It is shown through computer simulations that the FRN enhanced cellular systems with proposed frequency planning schemes can remarkably outperform conventional cellular systems when FRNs are communicating with BS over line-of-sight (LOS) links. The proper positioning of FRNs and the impacts of the reliability on the BS-FRN links are addressed as well.	bs 7799;computer simulation;interference (communication);line-of-sight (missile);mt framework;mobile phone;relay;software deployment	Ping Li;Mengtian Rong;Yisheng Xue;Egon Schulz	2007	2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2007.421	computer simulation;spectrum;routing;signal-to-interference ratio;telecommunications;computer science;base station;resource management;frequency;interference;time division multiple access;bandwidth;computer network	Mobile	27.328060442286702	87.29027055411532	18830

We observe that MDLVQ, in the form introduced by Servetto, Vaishampayan and Sloane in 1999, is inherently optimized for the central decoder; i.e., for a zero probability of a lost description. With a nonzero probability of description loss, performance is improved by modifying the encoding rule (using nearest neighbors with respect to “multiple description distance”) and by perturbing the lattice codebook. The perturbation maintains many symmetries and hence does not significantly effect encoding or decoding complexity. An extension to more than two descriptions with attractive decoding properties is outlined.	algorithm;codebook;convex hull;distortion;multiple description coding;vector quantization;xfig	Jonathan A.

First, we propose a new selection relaying scheme which switches between two fixed modes: direct transmission, and regenerative relaying cooperation. Unlike the existing scheme which employs instantaneous source-relay channel gain as criteria of the switching, we utilize only the geographical information of source, relay and destination terminals. Then, in order to apply our proposed scheme to large-scale networks, a cooperative partner selection protocol based on min-max criteria is introduced. We consider the scenario that all the nodes try to transmit packets to the same access point (AP) in a round-robin manner, and the AP tries to select a cooperative partner for each node utilizing the geographical information of nodes. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed selection relaying scheme can efficiently minimize the outage probability by properly choosing the dominant transmission mode. And our partner selection protocol based on the min-max criteria outperforms both the random partner selection strategy and the fixed non-cooperative strategy in terms of outage probability while ensuring fairness among users.	channel state information;downtime;exptime;fairness measure;maxima and minima;multi-user mimo;multistage interconnection networks;network switch;relay channel;round-robin scheduling;selection (genetic algorithm);simulation;wireless access point	Jing Shi;Guanding Yu;Zhaoyang Zhang;Yan Chen;Peiliang Qiu	2007	2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2007.185	computer simulation;communications protocol;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;probability;channel state information;relay channel;statistics;computer network	Mobile	31.475075101681973	88.17564753765626	18865

We focus on two-stage relay-interference networks where there are weak cross links, causing the networks to behave like a chain of Z Gaussian channels. Our main result is an approximate characterization of the capacity region for such ZZ and ZS networks. We propose a new interference management scheme, termed interference neutralization, which is implemented using structured lattice codes. This scheme allows for over-the-air interference removal, without the transmitters having complete access the interfering signals. This scheme in conjunction a new network decomposition technique provides the approximate characterization. Our analysis of these Gaussian networks is based on insights gained from an exact characterization of the corresponding linear deterministic model.	approximation algorithm;code;interference (communication);over the air;relay;statistical interference;transmitter	Soheil Mohajer;Suhas N.

In relay channels, the sender sends a message to the relay and the receiver, the relay encodes the channel output again and forwards it to the receiver, and the receiver decodes the message from the channel output. This paper deals with the universal coding problem for relay channels. First, we propose two new decoders based on the maximum mutual information decoder and show the existence of a universal code for relay channels by combining the proposed decoders and the coding scheme obtained by Cover and El Gamal. Second, we clarify the condition that the probability of error for each decoder decreases exponentially as the block length tends to infinity. Finally, we prove that the proposed universal code achieves the capacity of the degraded relay channel.	block code;internet relay chat;mutual information;relay channel;universal code (data compression)	Toshifumi Sakai;Tomohiko Uyematsu	2008	2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595033	telecommunications;theoretical computer science;probability of error;mathematics;relay channel;statistics	Crypto	35.906196419869666	67.6478607129754	19036

The receiver employs a digital processing scheme, consisting of an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter followed by quadrature decomposition and complex-valued envelope discrete Fourier transformation (DFT). Predecoder symbol error probability and post-decoder word error probability are presented as a function of Doppler shift, channel randomness parameter, and the symbol energy-to-noise ratio. The noise is assumed to be white and Gaussian distributed. Results show that for a typical symbol error rate of 10/sup -3/, the margin for 8-ary uncoded transmission must be increased by 8 dB to account for Doppler in a Rician fading channel. >	bch code;rayleigh–ritz method;reed–solomon error correction	Richard B.

For the precise range estimation, time averaging of the dechirped signals, which are transformed from the received chirp signals in different bands, is applied for reducing the bias effect of the multipaths on direct path. We verified the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm with Monte-Carlo simulation in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) in two path channels.	algorithm;cascading style sheets;chirp;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;mean squared error;monte carlo method;simulation;time of arrival	JeongHwan Lee;Jong-Wha Chong	2010	The IEEE symposium on Computers and Communications	10.1109/ISCC.2010.5546759	real-time computing;computer science;statistics;monte carlo method	Embedded	50.95309284245967	77.50335503473757	19086

Moreover, since linear precoders spread the spectrum, the equalisation process mitigates the effects of channel spectral nulls caused by frequency selective fading. This paper argues that certain affine precoders are more efficient than linear precoders. Here, the efficiency of a precoder is a measure of its ability to enable the receiver to recover the source signal relative to the amount of redundancy introduced by the precoder. An efficient affine precoder is heuristically derived and simulations used to demonstrate that it is superior to both the traditional training sequence method and the more recent filter bank precoding scheme. This precoding and equalisation scheme naturally extends to time varying channels.	adaptive equalizer;filter bank;finite impulse response;heuristic;reliability (computer networking);simulation	Jonathan H.

Most existing spectrum sensing techniques are based on simple energy detection. However, in practice, the signals transmitted by primary users usually also contain known symbol such as pilots and preambles for synchronization and channel estimation purposes. Coherent, correlation based spectrum sensing techniques can exploit these known symbols but waste the energy contained in the data symbols. In this paper, we propose a hybrid spectrum sensing scheme which exploits both the pilot and the data symbols transmitted by the primary user. For the practically relevant low signal-to-noise ratio regime, we derive a locally optimal hybrid detection metric, which turns out to be a linear combination of an energy detection metric and a correlation metric. Simulation and analytical results confirm that the hybrid metric outperforms both energy detection and coherent detection even if the pilot positions are not known a priori and have to be estimated by the CR receiver.	carrier recovery;channel state information;cognitive radio;coherent;interference (communication);lr parser;local optimum;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Farzad Moghimi;Robert Schober;Ranjan K.

The jitter noise is data-dependent, and a given noise sample is correlated with neighboring noise samples. A sequence detector with a nite decision delay can be formulated in a nite dimensional vector space. For a correlated noise channel, the decision boundary is generally quadratic. In this paper, we present a technique for obtaining a minimal set of hyperplanes approximating a quadratic decision boundary with a negligible performance loss. In this process, a distance measure, which is consistent with the notion of the e ective SNR, is de ned and used as a design parameter to trade the complexity and performance. As an achievable performance bound, we derive the e ective SNR for the maximum likelihood sequence detector (MLSD) for these channels. The performance of the partial response maximum likelihood (PRML) detector commonly adopted for current data storage channels as well as the Viterbi algorithm (VA) based on the traditional Euclidean metric, which serves as the MLSD for additive white Gaussian noise, are also analyzed and compared with that of the proposed signal space detector.

The construction of a list of the test error patterns is considered. The original ordered-statistics decoding (OSD) is generalized by assuming segmentation of the most reliable independent positions (MRIPs) of the received bits. The segmentation is shown to overcome several drawbacks of the original OSD. The complexity of the ordered statistics-based decoding is further reduced by assuming a partial ordering of the received bits in order to avoid the complex Gauss elimination. The probability of the test error patterns in the decoding list is derived. The bit error rate performance and the decoding complexity trade-off of the proposed decoding algorithms is studied by computer simulations. Numerical examples show that, in some cases, the proposed decoding schemes are superior to the original OSD in terms of both the bit error rate performance as well as the decoding complexity.	algorithm;bit error rate;block code;computer simulation;gaussian elimination;list decoding;local interconnect network;numerical linear algebra;original order	Saif E.

In this paper, we propose to apply a double layer space time block code (DLSTBC) for MIMO schemes in this hybrid transmission. The proposed scheme is based on a layered construction designed to be efficient in line of sight (LOS) situation but also in deep shadowing. It is then a very promising candidate for next generation handheld broadcasting systems and SFN architecture.	block code;handheld game console;mimo;next-generation network;single-frequency network;software deployment;terrestrial television	Youssef Nasser;Jean-François Hélard	2009	2009 IEEE 70th Vehicular Technology Conference Fall	10.1109/VETECF.2009.5378733	block code;electronic engineering;space–time block code;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;index term;telecommunications;computer science;space time;shadow mapping;least squares;double layer;digital video broadcasting;communications satellite;satellite;encoding;statistics;computer network;mimo	Mobile	27.447179139884167	82.27015367969122	19553

Two adaptive beamforming schemes based on least mean square (LMS) algorithm and pre-FFT combining are used to obtain the space diversity gain. Their difference, which lies in either the frequency-domain or time-domain pilot vector is used in the beamforming. In order to counter the severe frequency-selective fading which is inevitable in broadband wireless communications, we use the frequency-domain adaptive loading to load the bits and transmit power to the individual subcarriers. The performance investigations show that the combinational scheme based on the adaptive beamforming and adaptive loading is very effective in improving the performance of OFDM packet transmission.	adaptive beamformer;algorithm;beamforming;combinational logic;fast fourier transform;frequency divider;least mean squares filter;mean squared error;multiplexing;network packet;subcarrier	Ming Lei;Hiroshi Harada;Hiromitsu Wakana;Ping Zhang	2004	2004 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (IEEE Cat.

IEEE 802.16j MMR requires a method for finding the relay station (RS) route that minimises latency and maximises throughput. In this paper, we propose such a path selection method called optimal path relay association (OPRA). In this method, each RS in the MMR network is capable of finding its optimal path with path metrics which are available link bandwidth, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and hop count. Simulation results show that OPRA achieves performance gains over other path selection methods.

Based on the Kalman filter channel estimator, soft-input-soft-output (SISO) minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalizer and a maximum posterior probability (MAP) decoder, the channel estimate can be improved for each iteration by using soft information feedback from the decoder. Computer simulations show good estimation and tracking by the Kalman filter with only a few training (pilot) symbols even when signals experience deep fading. It is observed from simulations that the overall system performance can be improved by 4dB after 14 iterations compared to non-iterative channel estimation and equalization. The proposed method is shown to obtain fast channel estimation and low complexity turbo equalization which are requirements in time-varying fading channels.	block code;channel state information;concatenation;equalization (communications);frequency divider;iteration;kalman filter;mimo-ofdm;mean squared error;multipath propagation;multiplexing;rayleigh fading;requirement;simulation;soft-in soft-out decoder;turbo equalizer	Mohamed A.

A robust scheme is proposed to obtain the optimal linear transmit/receive filters in the sense of minimizing the average sum mean square error (SMSE) conditional on noisy channel estimates under a per-user transmit power constraint. Using an iterative procedure, the proposed scheme extends the existing optimization algorithm for uncorrelated single-user MIMO systems with perfect CSI to solve the problem of minimizing SMSE in spatially correlated MIMO downlinks with imperfect CSI. Comparing with non-robust scheme, we show that robust scheme efficiently mitigates the BER loss induced by imperfect CSI. In addition, the impact of fading correlation at BS on the performance of the proposed robust scheme is analyzed.	mimo;telecommunications link	Hao Li;Changqing Xu;Pingzhi Fan	2008	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietfec/e91-a.9.2626	spatial correlation;multidisciplinary design optimization;telecommunications;control theory;mathematics;mean squared error;channel state information;antenna array;statistics	Networks	41.9303868045857	86.81757988492645	19653

In contrast to the conventional erasure-only channel having M + 1 output symbols, the proposed readable-erasure channel has 2M output symbols. Half of the symbols are related to hit-free transmissions, and the rest of the symbols, referred to as weak symbols, are related to transmissions that were hit. The essence of the readable erasure is in the information hidden inside it. One may explore such information by using channel coding. Our analysis shows that in conjunction with channel coding, the readable-erasure channel may enjoy performance advantage over the erasure-only channel. By taking the spectrum efficiency into consideration, we point out that using RS codes over large channel alphabet size in FH/MFSK systems is inefficient. Thus, for FH/MFSK systems, we suggest BCH codes over GF(4) for use with the readable-erasure channel. 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, we propose and investigate an algorithm targeting this issue of nonunique identification in the framework of network localization. Our proposed method is based on a two-stage approach: The estimation of adjacency information based on the range measurements, and a maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation of the sensor that transmitted the ranging-pulse. The first stage can be formulated as a binary linear feasibility problem that is capable of significantly reducing the computational complexity and increasing the performance of the second stage. Our approach is compared to a method that does not exploit the estimated adjacency information. We show that our algorithm enables outstanding localization performance, also when using only few distinct transmission ID sequences.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;automatic vectorization;caller id;computational complexity theory;concatenation;identifier;limbo;randomness;sensor;utility functions on indivisible goods	Stephan Schlupkothen;Gerd Ascheid	2015	2015 14th Annual Mediterranean Ad Hoc Networking Workshop (MED-HOC-NET)	10.1109/MedHocNet.2015.7173166	electronic engineering;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning	Mobile	28.445195905545216	72.37285261470765	19694

41ec99d1a38993f5bf020b01fca42c51aef7953e	post-processing methods for improving coding gain in belief propagation decoding of polar codes		Belief propagation (BP) is a high-throughput, low- latency decoding algorithm for polar codes, but the error-correcting performance is known to be inferior than successive cancellation (SC) decoding. To improve the error-correcting performance of BP decoding, we design post- processing methods targeting false converged errors, oscillation errors, and unconverged errors that determine the performance of BP decoding. False convergence can be resolved by perturbing, or gradually freezing the information bits, followed by error cleanup using BP. Oscillations can be resolved by enhancing the stable bits and perturbing the unstable bits, followed by error cleanup using BP. Unconverged errors can be resolved by enhancing the reliably stable bits and weakening the unstable bits. Results show that the error rates of BP decoding can be improved by an order of magnitude or more, allowing it to overtake SC in error rate and coding gain. Post-processing can be implemented very efficiently, costing less than 4.3% overhead in silicon area, and it does not affect the throughput or latency of BP decoding.	algorithm;belief propagation;coding gain;control theory;error detection and correction;high-throughput computing;list decoding;overhead (computing);perturbation theory;polar code (coding theory);signal-to-noise ratio;software propagation;throughput;unified video decoder;video post-processing	Shuanghong Sun;Sung-Gun Cho;Zhengya Zhang	2017	GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254247	throughput;latency (engineering);coding gain;order of magnitude;real-time computing;belief propagation;word error rate;decoding methods;computer science;convergence (routing)	Vision	43.050035077959876	62.867259304439536	19903

The proposed scheme exploits the advantages of both V-BLAST and Alamouti space-time block coding (STBC). In particular, it adaptively only transmits space-time-coded copies to remediable collisions. The coded replicas contain the same information as the packets involved in collisions and are immediately sent after a colliding slot. Combining the packets received in two consecutive slots, the Alamouti STBC scheme can be reconstructed to linearly resolve the collision without sacrificing the space-time diversity gain. An embedded Markov chain is developed to derive performance metrics with respect to throughput, diversity gain, delay, and stability. The tradeoff among those metrics is investigated. The results demonstrate that ASTDSA significantly outperforms the existing schemes, and simulations are used to validate the analytical model.	mimo	Haiyou Guo;Honglin Hu;Yan Zhang;Hsiao-Hwa Chen	2009	IEEE Trans.

Closed-form formulations are derived for various nonlinear terms in the TKO output as well as for the performance gain of the IR-UWB systems with the TKO technique (over those without the TKO technique). Both theoretical analysis and computer simulations show that the TKO technique can effectively mitigate not only performance degradation caused by narrowband interference (NBI) but also that by additive white Gaussian noise. As a result, the TKO technique can be used to improve overall performance of ED based IR-UWB receivers regardless of an NBI being present or not.	additive white gaussian noise;computer simulation;elegant degradation;interference (communication);nonlinear system;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;stochastic process;ultra-wideband;utility functions on indivisible goods	Zhimeng Xu;Hong Nie;Zhizhang Chen;Hassan Khani;Weidong Xiang;Lun Yu	2012	2012 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/TWC.2014.041714.122066	stochastic process;telecommunications;bismuth;mathematics;interference;signal-to-noise ratio;bandwidth;statistics	EDA	42.27061812169241	76.51624740329714	19972

Unfortunately OFDM is very sensitive to synchronization errors, one of them being phase noise, which is of great importance in modern WLAN systems which target high data rates and tend to use higher frequency bands because of the spectrum availability. In this paper we propose a linear Kalman filter as a means for tracking phase noise and its suppression. The algorithm is pilot based.

It is assumed that the channel state information (CSI) is not fed back to the source and the relays and the case of imperfect CSI at the destination is also taken into consideration. In determining the parameters, conventional convex optimization schemes cannot be applied due to the non-convex nature of the function. A low complexity method is used to optimize the system that utilizes bisection search. Numerical calculations and BER simulations demonstrate a significant performance gain over conventional AF.	anisotropic filtering;bisection method;channel state information;coherent;convex optimization;cooperative mimo;input/output;mimo;mathematical optimization;multi-user mimo;numerical linear algebra;relay;simulation;standard database management analysis;x.690	Yi Zheng;Hani Mehrpouyan;Steven D.

Performance of turbo codes with noncoherent detection on AWGN channels has been analyzed by Hall and Wilson. They compared the performance of turbo codes with the achievable information theoretic channel capacity for noncoherent detection on AWGN channels. We, in this paper, derive the information theoretic channel capacity for noncoherent detection on Rayleigh fading channels, and show that noncoherent turbo decoder achieves performance close to this theoretical capacity (within 1.5 dB). We further show that the performance of noncoherent turbo decoder without the knowledge of channel fades is quite close (within 0.5 dB at 10 5 BER) to that with perfect knowledge of the channel fades. Optimum decoding of turbo codes requires the knowledge of channel SNR. With this requirement in mind, we propose online SNR estimation schemes, based on the ratio of certain observables at the output of the noncoherent detector, which when used in the turbo decoder gives performance very close to that with perfect knowledge of channel SNR.	additive white gaussian noise;channel capacity;information theory;observable;rayleigh fading;signal-to-noise ratio;turbo code;x.690	Ramesh Annavajjala;Ananthanarayanan Chockalingam;Laurence B.

dad60025028f42506f7ee9c16c4c2801b6813ac3	reliable data transmission for resonant-type wireless power transfer	communication;ofdm;control	Wireless power transfer research has been receiving a great deal of attention in recent years. In resonant-type wireless power transfer, energy is transferred via LC resonant circuits. However, system performance is dependent on the circuit components. To transfer power efficiently and safely, information, such as frequency, required power and element values, need to be transmitted reliably in the system. This paper investigates data communication using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation in resonant-type wireless power transfer systems. The equivalent circuit used in the transmitting and receiving antennas is a band pass filter (BPF) and its bandwidth is evaluated through circuit simulations and experimental measurements. Numerical results obtained through computer simulation show that the bit error rate (BER) performance is affected by the splitting resonant frequency. key words: OFDM, Wireless power transfer, BPF, communication, control	bit error rate;computer simulation;equivalent circuit;frequency divider;modulation;multiplexing;numerical linear algebra;resonance;transmitter;x.690	Shinpei Noguchi;Mamiko Inamori;Yukitoshi Sanada	2013	IEICE Transactions		orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;wi-fi array;fixed wireless;scientific control;computer network	Arch	45.86165237000455	83.99540779890795	20155

In order to improve the secrecy performance, artificial noise (AN) is used jointly with maximum ratio transmission (MRT) precoding. Since the idle users can be anywhere in the cell, we investigate the secrecy outage probability for the legitimate user by taking an expectation over the positions of all internal eavesdroppers. Furthermore, according to the secrecy performance of the legitimate user in the given location, we define a new concept Secrecy Area centered on the base station (BS) where all the legitimate users satisfy the secrecy quality-of-service (QoS) requirements i.e. secrecy outage probability. Then, in order to achieve the maximum Secrecy Area under the given secrecy QoS requirements, we derive the optimal power allocation factor for AN, which is irrelevant to the channel state information (CSI) of both the legitimate user and the eavesdropper. The analytical and simulation results show that, by AN-assisted MRT precoding, the secrecy performance is significantly improved and the Secrecy Area can be efficiently enlarged with a modest increase of the transmit power.	channel state information;downtime;mimo;quality of service;relevance;requirement;simulation;zero-forcing precoding	Hao Wei;Dongming Wang;Xiaoyun Hou;Yan Zhu;Jun Zhu	2015	2015 IEEE 82nd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2015-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2015.7391130	electronic engineering;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;antenna;signal-to-noise ratio;wireless;statistics;computer network;mimo	Metrics	34.57144495920032	81.85889254407904	20304

In this letter, we propose a Weakly Consistent OMS scheme for feedback reduction. The contribution of the proposed scheme is twofold: 1) feedback load is reduced while the multicast throughput performance remains comparable with the case of full feedback, and 2) no precise knowledge of the wireless fading channel is required. Performance evaluation through realistic WiMAX simulations shows that our proposed scheme can significantly reduce 65% of the feedback load while achieving 98% multicast throughput performance compared with the case of full feedback.	feedback;multicast;order management system;performance evaluation;scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput	Shiang-Ming Huang;Jenq-Neng Hwang;Yaw-Chung Chen	2010	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2010.12.101406	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;source-specific multicast;fading;xcast;computer network	Mobile	38.408711575149525	83.86500978964733	20334

In a two-antenna system, the bit-error rate performance of the proposed scheme approaches that of Alamouti's scheme when the channel is perfectly known. In the presence of channel mismatch, the proposed scheme outperforms Alamouti's scheme significantly. It is shown that, as the number of transmit antennas N goes to infinity, the effective channel for the introduced scheme behaves as if it were perfectly interleaved (i.e., as if the fading was independent). When N is small, further performance gain can be achieved by expanding the original signal constellation.	stochastic process	Yingxue Li;Costas N. Georghiades;Garng M. Huang	2003	IEEE Trans.

In contrast to point-to-point, interference-limited communications considered in prior works, we propose active cooperative relaying based schemes.

As long as n<sub>e</sub><sup>2</sup>(log(n<sub>e</sub>))<sup>γ</sup> = o(n<sub>l</sub>) holds for some positive γ, we show one can obtain unbounded secure aggregate rate. This means zero-cost secure communication, given a fixed total power constraint for the entire network. We achieve this result with (i) the source using Wyner randomized encoder and a serial (multi-stage) block Markov scheme, to cooperate with the relays, and (ii) the relays acting as a virtual multi-antenna to apply beamforming against the eavesdroppers. Our simpler parallel (two-stage) relaying scheme can achieve the same unbounded secure aggregate rate when n<sub>e</sub><sup>α/2 + 1</sup> (log(n<sub>e</sub>))<sup>γ+δ(α/2+1)</sup> = o(n<sub>l</sub>) holds, for some positive γ, δ.	aggregate data;beamforming;encoder;interference (communication);markov chain;multi-user mimo;point-to-point (telecommunications);randomized algorithm;relay;secure communication	Mahtab Mirmohseni;Panagiotis Papadimitratos	2014	IEEE INFOCOM 2014 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFOCOM.2014.6848088	telecommunications;computer science;communications system;computer network	Vision	34.369946776639395	70.74490299829937	20358

We begin with a mathematical characterization of the functional duality between classical source and channel coding, formulating the precise conditions under which the optimal encoder for one problem is functionally identical to the optimal decoder for the other problem. We then extend this functional duality to the case of coding with side information. By invoking this duality, we are able to generalize the result of Wyner and Ziv [1] relating to no rate loss for source coding with side information from Gaussian to more arbitrary distributions. We consider several examples corresponding to both discreteand continuous-valued cases to illustrate our formulation. For the Gaussian cases of coding with side information, we invoke geometric arguments to provide further insights into their duality. Our geometric treatment inspires the construction and dual use of practical coset codes for a large class of emerging applications for coding with side information, such as distributed sensor networks, watermarking, and information-hiding communication systems.	channel capacity;code;data compression;digital watermarking;encoder;forward error correction;information theory;sensor	S.

It is first shown that, for any x, the integrand φ(θ; x) of the Craig representation of Q(x) can be partitioned into a pair of complementary convex and concave segments. As a consequence of this property, integrals of φ(θ; x) over arbitrary intervals within its convex region can be lower-bounded by Jensen’s inequality and upper-bounded by Cotes’ quadrature rule, with the opposite occurring for the concave region φ(θ; x). The combination of these complementary bounds yield a complete family of both lower and upper bounds on Q(x), which are expressed in terms of elementary transcendental functions and can be made arbitrarily tight by finer segmentation. A by-product of the method is that various other functions, such as the squared Gaussian Q-function Q(x), the 2D joint Gaussian Q-function Q(x, y, ρ), and the generalized Marcum Q-function QM (x, y), can also be both upper and lower bounded with arbitrarily tightness, which to the best of our knowledge finds no precedence in the literature.

Since the traffic applications have their own distinctive patterns, spectral access and energy harvesting opportunities are also expected to be distinctive. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to identify the PU traffic patterns and estimate the energy harvested from each traffic pattern so that SU can maximize its capacity accordingly. More specifically, we propose a theoretical framework based on a variational inference algorithm to cluster various traffic patterns and design a threshold-based SU transmission strategy by taking into account the spectral access and energy harvesting opportunities for each traffic pattern, so as to optimize SU transmission. Through simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of throughput gains and show the transmission thresholds under various traffic applications (patterns). Further, we illustrate the effects of different collision costs on throughput for different traffic applications using real wireless traces.	algorithm;cognitive radio;one-class classification;simulation;superuser;throughput;tracing (software);variational principle	Muhammad Ejaz Ahmed;Dong In Kim;Kae Won Choi	2018	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2017.2734660	computer network;cognitive radio;wireless network;throughput;cluster analysis;radio resource management;wireless;airfield traffic pattern;wi-fi array;computer science	Mobile	32.15809342939124	86.38030656448987	20516

As an additional bit of evidence for this claim, we offer a few results showing the utility of lattice codes for the AWGN relay channel. We show that the decode-and-forward rates of the relay channel can be achieved using lattice encoding and decoding. We present an encoding/decoding technique that uses a doubly-nested lattice code. Encoding is accomplished using a combination of superposition encoding and block Markov encoding, while decoding is accomplished using a strategy reminiscent of Cover and El Gamal's list decoding. Our technique can be extended to a wide variety of relay topologies, including the half-duplex relay channel and the cooperative multiple-access channel.	additive white gaussian noise;character encoding;code;duplex (telecommunications);lattice qcd;list decoding;markov chain;network topology;relay channel	Matthew S.

We call these networks 2-hop relay networks. Therefore, studying the capacity of 2-hop relay networks is very important. Most practical network coding protocols that perform the superposition ignore the diversity among the links by turning off coding when the channels are lossy. Other protocols deal with the packets separately - not as members of flows - which makes the network coding problem with lossy links intractable. In this paper, we use a different approach by looking at flows or batches instead of individual packets. We characterize the capacity region of the 2-hop relay network with packet erasure channels when the coding operations are limited to XOR. We derive our results by constructing an upper bound on the capacity region and then providing a coding scheme that can achieve the upper bound. The capacity characterization is in terms of linear equations. We also extend our 2-hop relay networks results to multihop wireless networks by providing a linear program that can perform the superposition optimally. We perform extensive simulations for both the 2-hop relay and large wireless networks and show the superiority of our protocols over the network coding protocols that deal with the packets separately.	binary erasure channel;bottleneck (software);cobham's thesis;distributed algorithm;exclusive or;fairness measure;linear equation;linear network coding;linear programming;lossy compression;network packet;quantum superposition;relay;simulation;throughput;vii	Abdallah Khreishah;Jie Wu;Pouya Ostovari;Issa M.

Users rely on adaptive modulation and power modes that they select in accordance with the ̄nite-rate feedback (FRF) they receive from the base station (BS). The BS uses CSI to maximize a generic concave utility of average rates while adhering to power constraints imposed on every user. We utilize a stochastic approximation primal-dual algorithm for on-line scheduling and resource allocation. The resultant optimum resource allocation depends on the current channel realization and optimally calculates dual prices. The simulation results show that the system throughput of proposed algorithm is not only good but also can e®ectively reduce the feedback overhead and the adoption of TCM can improve the system throughput greatly comparing to uncoded system.	channel state information;clock rate;computer cooling;concave function;convolutional code;diffusing update algorithm;feedback;frequency response;mimo-ofdm;memory management;modulation;online and offline;open road tolling;overhead (computing);resultant;scheduling (computing);simulation;stochastic approximation;subcarrier;throughput;trellis quantization	Lei Xu;Dazhuan Xu;Xiaofei Zhang;Shufang Xu;Junbo Wang;Yaping Li	2011	Journal of Circuits, Systems, and Computers	10.1142/S0218126611007414	best-effort delivery;electronic engineering;real-time computing;mimo-ofdm;resource allocation;computer science;control theory	Mobile	36.576288543411394	86.98452437746083	20644

This brings several advantages. We study direct communication with localized distribution, so that users tend to gather around some areas (clusters/hot-spots) within the cell such as buildings. Previous analysis about clustering has focused on one dimensional scenarios. Here we present theoretical analysis of direct communication with two dimensional clustering. Additional analysis is presented for direct communication with correlated clusters. With correlated clusters some pairs of source and destination clusters are more probable than other pairs. According to our best knowledge, this is the first time that theoretical analysis is presented about clustering and correlated clusters in two dimensional scenarios. Simulations confirm the validity of the analysis. In addition to the exact results, we also suggest using the point-based approximation to rapidly and easily obtain results. The numerical results show that the gains from direct communication, in terms of blocking probability and carried traffic, depend on the offered traffic. Additionally, correlation in cluster selection is shown to significantly improve performance. Point-based approximation is shown to be very useful when the number of clusters is large. key words: clustering, direct communication, two dimensional	approximation algorithm;blocking (computing);centralized computing;cluster analysis;computer simulation;erlang (unit);numerical analysis	Janne J.

a5d7fca6ff9c5592deb30a740891edea88172c90	large system analysis for amplify & forward simo multiple access channel with ill-conditioned second hop		Relaying has been extensively studied during the last decades and has found numerous applications in wireles s communications. The simplest relaying method, namely ampl ify and forward, has shown potential in MIMO multiple access systems, when Gaussian fading channels are assumed for both hops. However, in some cases ill conditioned channels may ap pear on the second hop. For example, this impairment could affect cooperative BS systems with microwave link backhauling, wh ich involve strong line of sight channels with insufficient scat tering. In this paper, we consider a large system analysis of such as model focusing on both optimal joint decoding and joint MMSE filtering receivers. Analytical methods based on free probability are presented for calculating the ergodic throughput, the MMSE error and the average SINR. Furthermore, the performance degradation of the system throughput is evalua ted considering second hop impairments such as ill-conditionig and rank deficiency, while highand low-SNR limits are calculat ed for the considered performance metrics. Finally, the cooperat ive BS system is compared to a conventional channel resource divis ion strategy and suitable operating points are proposed.	angular defect;elegant degradation;ergodicity;hop;i/o controller hub;mimo;microwave;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;system analysis;throughput	Symeon Chatzinotas	2014	CoRR		telecommunications;computer network	ML	36.84768892230527	79.97040311094435	20807

Assuming PSK modulation, two scenarios are envisaged in which frequency estimates are derived either from a preamble appended to the data block, or directly from the modulated signal. Several estimation algorithms are considered with different and somewhat contrasting characteristics. The characteristics we focus on are: estimation accuracy, estimation range, minimum operating signal-to-noise ratio (threshold), and implementation complexity. They provide a framework within which current estimation methods can be evaluated.

However, wave propagation in troposphere shows significant dependence on hydro-meteors: especially rain. Therefore, the main motivation of this paper is to develop a rain attenuation model for troposcatter communications, which can model nonuniform multiple rain cells for the first time. At the end, we present simulation results for the amount of rain loss and the distribution of maximum data rates under rain in troposcatter links.	carrier wave;line-of-sight (missile);rain fade;simulation;software propagation	Ergin Dinc;Özgür B.

a2b5ca17d56902d5c4b96701956e969fef3ec7d1	performance analysis of symbol swapped spatial modulation		In this work we propose and analyze the performance of an Nt × Nr multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system model that uses spatial modulation (SM) over two time slots. A tuple of information symbols [p, q] is transmitted using SM in first time slot by selecting pth transmitter antenna and illuminating that antenna with qth symbol from either M-ary phase shift keying (MPSK) or M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (MQAM) constellation. Whereas in the second time slot, the tuple [q, p] is transmitted using SM, thereby q is transmitted using spatial constellation and p is transmitted using either MPSK or MQAM constellation. We call this system model symbol swapped SM (SS-SM). We analyze the performance of SS-SM using an upper bound on the bit error rate (BER) based on pairwise error probability (PEP). We show using simulation results that SS-SM performs better than conventional SM. Further, simulation results also substantiate the upper bound on the BER of SS-SM. Moreover, the improvement in the performance of SS-SM over conventional SM is deduced from the derived PEP.	bit error rate;key (cryptography);mimo;modulation;paging;pairwise error probability;profiling (computer programming);simulation;spectral efficiency;stellar classification;transmitter;x.690	Palani Maheswaran;M.

In this letter, a downlink multiple-input multiple-output decode-and-forward relaying network is analyzed by considering Nakagami-$m$ fading as a model for the channel gains. The system performance is analyzed by using a joint scheme (JS), which joints the relay selection and the antenna selection at the base station and the selected relay. A closed-form expression corresponding to the outage probability is derived, and the approximate expression of the outage probability in the high-signal-to-noise-ratio regime is obtained. Finally, simulations show the superiority of the JS.	approximation algorithm;channel capacity;downtime;javascript;mimo;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;sun outage;telecommunications link	Yangyang Zhang;Jianhua Ge	2017	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2017.2671401	3g mimo;telecommunications	Networks	36.832746487265425	81.35468828799121	21045

It provides a natural and efficient mechanism for accumulating mutual information from multiple transmitting relays. We develop an analysis of queued cooperative relay systems that combines the communication-theoretic transmission aspects of cooperative communication using rateless codes over Rayleigh fading channels with the queuing-theoretic aspects associated with buffering messages at the relays. Relay cooperation combined with queuing reduces the message transmission times and also helps distribute the traffic load in the network, which improves throughput significantly.	a mathematical theory of communication;acknowledgment index;code (cryptography);end-to-end principle;global communications conference;load balancing (computing);mutual information;network packet;parity bit;rayleigh fading;relay;round-robin scheduling;subject matter expert turing test;throughput;transmitter	Neelesh B.

Phase synchronization can be accomplished through the use of IEEE 1588v2 or GPS receivers. However when dealing with small cells deployed in an uncoordinated manner, such as Home-eNBs, the use of IEEE 1588v2 is not always feasible due to delay and jitter impairments which can be present in xDSL lines. Moreover, GPS receivers are not operative in indoors. The present paper describes an over-the-air synchronization mechanism whereby already synchronized LTE macro cells transmit a new physical signal on a subset of yet unused resource elements, so that small cells can acquire suitable phase synchronization. As the involved resources are reserved and not used for transmission, interference is much lower and signal to noise ratio can be improved compared to traditional network listening modes. Simulations employing a simple proposed receiver structure show very good results in channels where the delay spread is within the length of the cyclic prefix.	cell (microprocessor);compaq lte;computer simulation;digital subscriber line;exploit (computer security);global positioning system;interference (communication);precision time protocol;signal-to-noise ratio	Javier Lorca	2013	2013 IEEE 77th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2013.6692688	synchronization;electronic engineering;real-time computing;jitter;global positioning system;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;radio receiver	Embedded	25.208650940808322	86.64932102030677	21198

However, there are potential interferences among those using in the same frequency bands and close range. This paper discusses the interference DAA (Detection And Avoidance) technique for coexisting pulse based UWB and OFDM systems. In a UWB transmitter-receiver, utilization of the OFDM signal is detected by correlating the GI (Guard Interval) signal, and the timing of GI period is also detected. The UWB signal is emitted during the GI period to mitigate the effect of interference to the OFDM signals from the UWB system. The DER (Detection Error Rate), FAR (False Alarm Rate) and BER (Bit Error Rate) performances are evaluated to show the availability of proposed DAA technique.

This means that conventionally negligible error sources like the imbalance between the in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) branches of the receiver can start limiting the performance of the system. This is especially true when at the same time cheaper, smaller, more robust and more versatile analog front ends are required from the RF designers. This paper describes the sources and the effect of the IQ imbalance as well as a new method for correcting the error due to the imbalance in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems. The described method can correct both constant and frequency dependent imbalance by using the pilot signals of the transmission to detect the imbalance so little computational power is required compared to the decision aided methods.

The sensitivity of mmWave signals to blockages, such as buildings in cities, however, makes the network performance hard to predict. Using concepts from stochastic geometry and random shape theory, this paper proposes an analytical framework to incorporate the blockage effects and evaluate the performance of mmWave cellular networks, in terms of coverage probability and achievable rate. Leveraging prior work on a blockage model, a stochastic characterization of the regions covered by line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS links is obtained, which allows different path loss laws to be applied to the LOS and non-LOS links, respectively. Based on the proposed framework, analytical expressions for the mmWave downlink coverage probability are derived, and then the network performance is examined. Numerical results show that millimeter wave (mmWave) networks can provide comparable coverage probability and much higher data rates than microwave networks.	fifth generation computer;line-of-sight (missile);microwave;network performance;numerical method;telecommunications link	Tianyang Bai;Robert W.

In this architecture, a large number of users communicate directly with each other through their closest cluster heads. It is assumed that the location of the users and the cluster heads are two independent two-dimensional homogeneous Poisson point processes over an unbounded plain. A common bandwidth is shared among all users and the transmitted signals undergo path loss and Log-normal shadowing. A perfect power control is assumed in a user to cluster head transmission. We analyze the performance of this wireless network by calculating the probability of outage over a cluster head. To this end, we derive analytical formulas for the mean and the variance of the total amount of interference. Further, we show that the total interference received by the cluster head precisely follows Lognormal distribution. The accuracy of Log-normal assumption as well as the obtained analytical results are verified by simulations.	coefficient;computer cluster;downtime;interference (communication);simulation	Aydin Behnad;Hakimeh Purmehdi;Farshad Lahouti	2010	2010 17th International Conference on Telecommunications	10.1109/ICTEL.2010.5478814	stochastic process;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;mathematics;statistics	Mobile	28.803839324319366	84.08325499064723	21424

This paper studies the impact of channel state information (CSI) on the capacity of massive MIMO systems with codebook-based hybrid beamforming , where the RF precoder is selected from a finite size codebook. Two types of CSI at the BS (CSIT) are commonly assumed: full instantaneous CSIT and hybrid CSIT (channel statistics plus the low-dimensional effective channel matrix). With full instantaneous CSIT, both the RF and baseband precoders are adaptive to the full instantaneous CSI at the fast timescale. With hybrid CSIT, the RF precoder is adaptive to channel statistics only, and the baseband precoder is adaptive to the instantaneous effective channel, yielding lower implementation complexity by sacrificing some capacity. We derive asymptotic sum capacity expressions under these two types of CSIT. We find that, in codebook-based hybrid beamforming systems, exploiting the full instantaneous CSIT can only achieve a marginal SNR gain and hybrid CSIT is sufficient to achieve the first-order gain provided by the massive MIMO for most of the cases. We also propose fast and slow timescale RF precoding algorithms, which asymptotically achieve the capacity under full instantaneous CSIT and hybrid CSIT, respectively.	algorithm;baseband;beamforming;channel state information;codebook;first-order predicate;mimo;marginal model;radio frequency;signal-to-noise ratio	An Liu;Vincent K.

The first design is a reparametrisation of rotation matrices applied to diagonal matrices to form unitary space-time codes. The rotation matrices are applied as matrices similar to Alamouti-style block codes. The second design subsumes rotation matrices applied to diagonal matrices for two antennas. These designs are applied in a non-coherent/differential framework. Optimisation of constellations is performed using the union bound on block-error probability, for which a new exact closed-form expression is given. Both designs have superior block-error performance over previous designs, and have similar performance to each other.

53a6bce70ba90d76e9ad778d4321a9639e37aecd	quantum enigma machines and the locking capacity of a quantum channel	article	The locking effect is a phenomenon which is unique to quantum information theory and represents one of the strongest separations between the classical and quantum theories of information. The Fawzi-Hayden-Sen (FHS) locking protocol harnesses this effect in a cryptographic context, whereby one party can encode n bits into n qubits while using only a constant-size secret key. The encoded message is then secure against any measurement that an eavesdropper could perform in an attempt to recover the message, but the protocol does not necessarily meet the composability requirements needed in quantum key distribution applications. In any case, the locking effect represents an extreme violation of Shannon’s classical theorem, which states that information-theoretic security holds in the classical case if and only if the secret key is the same size as the message. Given this intriguing phenomenon, it is of practical interest to study the effect in the presence of noise, which can occur in the systems of both the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper. This paper formally defines the locking capacity of a quantum channel as the maximum amount of locked information that can be reliably transmitted to a legitimate receiver by exploiting many independent uses of a quantum channel and an amount of secret key sublinear in the number of channel uses. We provide general operational bounds on the locking capacity in terms of other well-known capacities from quantum Shannon theory. We also study the important case of bosonic channels, finding limitations on these channels’ locking capacity when coherent-state encodings are employed and particular locking protocols for these channels that might be physically implementable.	coherence (physics);coherent states;composability;cryptography;encode;enigma machine;information theory;information-theoretic security;key (cryptography);lock (computer science);patrick hayden (scientist);quantum channel;quantum information;quantum key distribution;qubit;requirement;shannon (unit)	Saikat Guha;Patrick M.

While the IEEE 802.11 standard coordinates contention effectively, it severely limits the number of concurrent communications. This results in reduced throughput and efficiency. Recent research has focused on employing multiple antennas to increase throughput in a multipath environment by enabling multiple streams between a transmit-receive pair. In this paper we show that exploiting multiuser diversity to enable concurrent communications has certain advantages over multiple streaming.

In the IEEE 802.22 proposal, short quiet periods are arranged inside frames to perform a coarse intra-frame sensing as a pre-alarm for fine inter-frame sensing. However, the limited sample size of the quiet periods may not guarantee a satisfying performance and an additional burden of quiet-period synchronization is required. To improve the sensing performance, we first propose a quiet-active sensing scheme in which inactive customer-provided equipments (CPEs) will sense the channels in both the quiet and active periods. To avoid quiet-period synchronization, we further propose to utilize (optimized) active sensing, in which the quiet periods are replaced by 'quiet samples' in other domains, such as quiet sub-carriers in OFDMA systems. By doing so, we not only save the need for synchronization, but also achieve selection diversity by choosing quiet sub-carriers based on channel conditions. The proposed active sensing scheme is also promising for spectrum sharing applications where both the cognitive and primary systems can be active simultaneously.	active galactic nucleus;artificial intelligence;intra-frame coding	Shenghui Song;Karama Hamdi;Khaled Ben Letaief	2010	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2010.06.090924	synchronization;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;signal processing	Mobile	52.619776561544754	86.39663872041149	21486
83bd46e4f292b3d057d0cdeee367030a35776c2e	adaptive modulation and interference cancellation techniques for mimo-ofdm wireless networks		Multiple-input multiple-output antenna-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) is one of the most wanted wireless broadband technology and transmission systems that has been accepted as the basis of fourth generation (4G) wireless communication is MIMO-OFDM. It is so flexible and adaptable to stay in power even in the coming up 5G technologies. The relative motion of the transmitter and receiver can bring alteration in the channel within the time period of an OFDM, hence OFDM causes loss of orthogonally between sub carrier which results in inter-carrier interference. In order to overcome these issues, an adaptive modulation and interference cancellation technique for MIMO-OFDM wireless network are proposed. Along with interference cancellation technique, adaptive modulation is used to meet the required BER performance by selecting suitable modulation modes based on the channel condition. Doppler assisted channel estimation method is used to estimate the channel. Also, inter channel/carrier interference (ICI) cancellation scheme is used to integrate the parallel interference cancellation together with the decision statistical combining (PIC-DSC) module to detect the data and transmit it to the estimator to iteratively refine the channel and give interference free channel. Simulation results shows that the proposed method improves the BER performance of the system.	interference (communication);mimo;mimo-ofdm;modulation	Ahmed Ali Mundeth;Jasmin Erakkath Abdu	2018	IJNVO	10.1504/IJNVO.2018.10013255	frequency-division multiplexing;wireless network;knowledge management;mimo;single antenna interference cancellation;computer science;mimo-ofdm;electronic engineering;link adaptation;modulation;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing	Mobile	47.851368559119194	79.95315446540187	21489

In this paper, we investigate designs of a new statistical precoder for spatial multiplexing systems with maximum likelihood (ML) receiver which requires only correlation statistics at the transmitter. Two kinds of closed-form solution precoders based on rotation and power allocation are proposed by means of maximizing the minimum Euclidean distance of joint symbol constellations. In addition, we extend our results to linear receivers for correlated channels. We provide a method which yields the same profits from the proposed precoders based on a simple zero-forcing (ZF) receiver. The simulation shows that 2dB and 8dB gains are achieved for ML and ZF systems with two transmit antennas, respectively, compared to the conventional systems.	euclidean distance;expectation–maximization algorithm;interference (communication);mimo;noise power;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;spatial multiplexing;transmitter;x.690;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding	Sung Hyun Moon;Jin-Sung Kim;Inkyu Lee	2010	2010 IEEE 71st Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2010.5493705	electronic engineering;telecommunications;control theory;mathematics;spatial multiplexing;fading;statistics	EDA	41.51183660149318	78.5574637472075	21508

In this research, the measurements and various empirical models are analysed and compared in order to find out a suitable propagation model to provide guidelines for cell planning of wireless communication systems. The measured data was taken in urban region with low vegetation and some trees at 900 MHz frequency band. Path loss models are useful planning tools, which permit the designers of cellular communication to obtain optimal levels for the base station deployment and meeting the expected service level requirements. Outcomes show that these empirical models tend to overestimate the propagation loss. As one of the key outputs, it was observed that the calculations of Weissberger model fit with the measured data in urban environment.

In superposed multicarrier transmission scheme forward error correction (FEC) coding is applied over subcarriers so that the effects of interference caused by superposition is mitigated by interleaving effects. When the interference power is large, the effects of FEC become smaller particularly owing to the mis-setting of initial log likelihood ratio (LLR). To solve this problem, FEC metric masking is proposed where initial LLRs for superposed subcarriers are replaced by neutral value in the receiver followed by decoding. This technique is effective, however, it needs the information about superposed frequency band. In this paper we propose a scheme to detect superposed band by using FEC metric masking. In the proposed scheme, the subcarriers where FEC metric masking is applied are changed and packet error rate (PER) is measured. When the FEC metric masking is applied to the superposed subcarriers, PER is minimized. Based on the change of PER, we can detect the superposed band. We evaluate the proposed scheme by computer simulation and show that it can detect the superposed band with high probability.	bit error rate;computer simulation;error detection and correction;forward error correction;frequency band;interference (communication);lucas–lehmer–riesel test;network packet;quantum superposition;requirement;subcarrier;with high probability	Tomoaki Ohtsuki;Genji Hayashi;Jun Mashino;Takatoshi Sugiyama	2012	2012 IEEE 75th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VETECS.2012.6240279	electronic engineering;frequency allocation;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;forward error correction;statistics	Mobile	48.70392361970345	80.63885417011417	21590

It has long been known that feedback may increase the capacity of such channels as long as the additive noise process is not white. We prove that a strictly positive gain is always achieved. In addition, we prove that as the signal power goes to zero the ratio of feedback capacity to capacity without feedback may be strictly greater than one if the noise spectrum has a null. This is not the case when the noise spectrum is bounded away from zero. We also demonstrate that random coding, where the codewords are chosen from an ensemble of stationary Gaussian sequences, does not achieve capacity.	additive white gaussian noise;code word;colors of noise;feedback;stationary process;utility functions on indivisible goods	Lawrence H.

Specifically, we study the scenario where three terminals exchange their messages via a satellite gateway. The main difference between the proposed scheme and conventional three-way relay channel is the use of joint channel and network coding. This allows three terminals to transmit simultaneously, therefore, reducing the number of time slots. In our scheme, the relay may either amplify and forward or de-noise and forward, whereas in the conventional scheme the relay decodes and performs bit-wise exclusive OR on the packets or simply decodes the bit-wise XOR of the two messages and broadcasts it to all terminals. So while conventional schemes assume a binary channel on the downlink, we assume a ternary channel on the downlink. Furthermore, while in the conventional scheme each terminal removes its own message from the downlink signal in order to recover the other terminal's message, in our scheme after removing its own message, a terminal can decode a second terminal's encoded message treating the third terminal message as interference and finally recover the third terminal's message interference-free. We show that our scheme achieves a total rate of 2.	communications satellite;exclusive or;interference (communication);linear network coding;multicast;overhead (computing);raptor code;relay channel;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;telecommunications link	Boulos Wadih Khoueiry;M.

This result is obtained by proving a strong converse theorem for the classical capacity of all phase-insensitive bosonic Gaussian channels, a well-established model of optical quantum communication channels, such as lossy optical fibers, amplifier, and free-space communication. The theorem holds under a particular photon-number occupation constraint, which we describe in detail in this paper. Our result bolsters the understanding of the classical capacity of these channels and opens the path to applications, such as proving the security of noisy quantum storage models of cryptography with optical links.	active worlds;amplifier;channel (communications);classical capacity;cryptography;fock state;information theory;internet slang;lossy compression;microtransaction;newton;optical fiber;organizing (structure);physical information;quantum channel;quantum mechanics;residential gateway	Bhaskar Roy Bardhan;Raul Garcia-Patron;Mark M.

The IEEE Working Group has proposed the 802.16j relay technology. This technology can be used to forward data for a BS while overcoming the signal strength attenuation. Since the cost of constructing the relay station is low, the MS will have to scan more than one signal when entering the Mobile Multi-Hop Relay (MMR) network. In this paper, we introduce a novel path selection mechanism that exploits the remaining slot and signal strength indicator (SSI). Since the signal strength will affect the Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) combination, we propose to use SSI integrated with the MCS, taking the hop count into account. We demonstrate that our proposed scheme is capable of producing an optimal path selection.	broadcast relay station;hop;modulation;multi-master replication;uncompressed video	Jian-Ming Chang;Chin-Feng Lai;Han-Chieh Chao;Jiann-Liang Chen	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2012.6364288	telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	25.934279317463417	86.84363708485334	21689

However the burden imposed by the huge amount of data to be collected (in the uplink) from the radio remote heads (RRHs) and processed at the base band unit (BBU) poses serious challenges. In order to reduce the computation effort of minimum mean square error (MMSE) receiver at the BBU the Gaussian message passing (MP) together with a suitable sparsification of the channel matrix can be used. In this paper we propose two sets of solutions, either centralized or distributed ones. In the centralized solutions, we propose different approaches to sparsify the channel matrix, in order to reduce the complexity of MP. However these approaches still require that all signals reaching the RRH are conveyed to the BBU, therefore the communication requirements among the backbone network devices are unaltered. In the decentralized solutions instead we aim at reducing both the complexity of MP at the BBU and the requirements on the RRHs-BBU communication links by pre-processing the signals at the RRH and convey a reduced set of signals to the BBU.	algorithm;baseband;c-ran;centralized computing;computation;computational complexity theory;internet backbone;mean squared error;message passing;overhead (computing);preprocessor;radio access network;requirement;telecommunications link	Alessandro Brighente;Stefano Tomasin	2017	2017 IEEE 86th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2017.8287930	message passing;computer network;decoding methods;c-ran;radio access network;computer science;telecommunications link;minimum mean square error;distributed computing;backbone network;communication channel	Mobile	44.97532193281056	86.8597958858846	21691

Information bits, encoded in the time variations of the concentration of molecules, are conveyed to the receiver front through the molecular diffusion in the medium. The receiver, in turn, measures the concentration of the molecules in its vicinity in order to retrieve the information. This is done via ligand-reception process. In this paper, we develop models to study the constraints imposed by the concentration sensing at the receiver side and derive the maximum rate by which a ligand-receiver can receive information. Therefore, the overall capacity of the diffusion channel with the ligand receptors can be obtained by combining the results presented in this paper with our previous work on the achievable information rate of molecular communication over the diffusion channel.

Analytical calculations are verified by conducting simulations. In terms of the P e , the SRRC-based system results in a worse performance value than those of the time-limited chip waveform-based systems.

In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for IDMA system with low latency while maintaining low complexity. In the conventional architecture, the IDMA receiver sequentially processes deinterleaving, despreading, spreading and interleaving for multiuser detection. The proposed architecture, which is called the interleaved domain, can perform multi-user detection directly without deinterleaving the received frame. Because of this, the interleaving is no longer needed in the interference cancellation loop resulting in the decrease of latency by half and the increase of throughput by twice. In VLSI implementation results, the proposed architecture has reduced circuit area and power consumption by 53% and 58% compared to the conventional architecture on the same throughput condition.	fifth generation computer;forward error correction;interference (communication);interrupt latency;multi-user;throughput;very-large-scale integration	Tran Thi Thao Nguyen;Leonardo Lanante;Yuhei Nagao;Masayuki Kurosaki;Shingo Yoshizawa;Hiroshi Ochi	2017	2017 IEEE 85th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2017.8108683	latency (engineering);architecture;throughput;electronic engineering;multiuser detection;single antenna interference cancellation;latency (engineering);computer science;very-large-scale integration;real-time computing;interleaving	Arch	46.89658773471869	65.01584625409741	21908
b0f085fbe4b699f0ffe3fc9e19b263a4f1bc2024	subarray-based coordinated beamforming training for mmwave and sub-thz communications	array signal processing;training;phase shifters;radio frequency;bandwidth;antennas;hardware	Millimeter-wave (mmWave) and sub-Terahertz (THz) communications are compelling as an enabler for next-generation wireless networks. In this paper, we study mmWave and sub-THz systems with array-of-subarray architecture. To accommodate the ultrabroad bandwidth in the mmWave and sub-THz bands, time-delay phase shifters are introduced in system design. Our goal is to investigate beamforming training with hybrid processing to extract the dominant channel information, which would fully exploit channel characteristics while respecting the nature of circuit hardware. In particular, codebooks based on time-delay phase shifters are defined and structured. Then, two multi-resolution time-delay codebooks are designed through subarray coordination. One is built on adaptation of physical beam directions, and the other relies on dynamic approximation of beam patterns. Also, a low-complexity system implementation with modifications on the time-delay codebooks is studied. Furthermore, based on the proposed codebooks, a hierarchical beamforming training strategy with reduced overhead is developed to enable simultaneous training for multiple users. Simulation results show that the proposed multi-resolution time-delay codebooks could provide sufficient beam gains and are robust over large bandwidth. Also, the effectiveness of the hierarchical beamforming training is verified.	approximation;beamforming;codebook;gate array;intel terahertz;multi-user;overhead (computing);simulation;systems design;unicode collation algorithm	Cen Lin;Geoffrey Ye Li;Li Wang	2017	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2017.2720038	real-time computing;wireless network;implementation;radio frequency;computer science;systems design;exploit;beamforming;bandwidth (signal processing);communication channel	Mobile	43.7660065592196	86.24472629396726	21909

We propose a novel fully distributed algorithm, in order to calculate the optimal transmit power allocation for each sensor node (SN) and the optimal number of quantization bits for the test statistic in order to match the channel capacity. The SNs send their quantized information over orthogonal uncorrelated channels to the FC which linearly combines them and makes a final decision. What makes this scheme attractive is that the SNs share with their neighbours just their individual transmit powers at the current states. As a result, the SN processing complexity is further reduced.	channel capacity;distributed algorithm;quantization (signal processing);robustness (computer science);sensor node;transmitter	Edmond Nurellari;Desmond C.

d25c98bf3b6ff8306c3794dfebe0d0907ed8b594	on the performance of cognitive satellite-terrestrial networks		We investigate the performance of a multi-beam cognitive satellite terrestrial network in which a secondary network (mobile terrestrial system) shares resources with a primary satellite network given that the interference temperature constraint is satisfied. The terrestrial base stations (BSs) and satellite users are modeled as independent homogeneous Poisson point processes. Utilizing tools from stochastic geometry, we study and compare the outage performance of three secondary transmission schemes: first is the power constraint (PCI) scheme where the transmit power at the terrestrial BS is limited by the interference temperature constraint. In the second scheme, the terrestrial BSs employ directional beamforming to focus the signal intended for the terrestrial user, and in the third, BSs that do not satisfy the interference temperature constraint are thinned out (BTPI). Analytical approximations of all three schemes are derived and validated through numerical simulations. It is shown that for the least interference to the satellite user, BTPI is the best scheme. However, when thinning is not feasible, PCI scheme is the viable alternative. In addition, the gains of directional beamforming are optimal when the terrestrial system employs massive multiple-input-multiple-output transceivers or by the use of millimeter wave links between terrestrial BSs and users.

Bottleneck links in a multihop wireless network limit the maximum rate achieved by users along their routes. Under the proposed scheme a link dynamically switches between different power adaptation algorithms based on whether it is a bottleneck or a non-bottleneck link. Specifically, non-bottleneck links iteratively reduce their transmit powers whereas the bottleneck links use power control to exploit the corresponding interference reduction and further increase their signal-to-noise-and-interference ratios (SINRs). We show substantial system throughput performance gain under our scheme and for which, under certain scenarios, we derive a closed-form expression of the converged transmit power levels regardless of their initial values.	aggregate data;algorithm;bottleneck (network);bottleneck (software);end-to-end principle;interference (communication);network switch;relay;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;throughput;uncompressed video	S.

One is three-party quantum broadcast scheme, which realizes the broadcast among three participants. The other is multi-output quantum teleportation. Both allow two distant receivers to simultaneously and deterministically obtain the arbitrary single-qubit states, respectively. Compared with former schemes of an arbitrary single-qubit state, the proposed schemes realize quantum multi-cast communication efficiently, which enables Bob and Charlie to obtain the states simultaneously in the case of just knowing Alice’s measurement results.

In this paper, we further examine the employment of censoring in infrastructure-less cognitive radio networks, where nodes employ binary consensus algorithms to take global decisions regarding a binary hypothesis test without a fusion center to coordinate such a process. We show analytically - and verify by simulations - that censoring enhances the performance of such networks in terms of error probability and convergence times. Our protocol shows performance gains up to 46.6\% in terms of average error probability over its conventional counterpart, in addition to performance gains of about 48.7% in terms of average energy expenditure and savings up to 50% in incurred transmission overhead.	algorithm;censoring (statistics);cognitive radio;network performance;overhead (computing);simulation	Mohamed Seif;Mohammed Karmoose;Moustafa Youssef	2015	2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145732	telecommunications;computer science;statistics	Mobile	47.97596706495494	87.77485811023008	22066

Under the short-term average power constraint and for the delay limited communication, we show that only a partial Channel State Information at the Transmitter (CSIT) is enough to achieve the optimum Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff (DMT) at the IC. We develop a coding scheme for the two-user quasi-static Raleigh fading IC. At the low rate region, this results in a one-level Gaussian code independent of the channel condition. At the high rate region, the result can be one-level or two-level Gaussian codes depending on the partial CSIT. The partial state information for each channel gain can be represented by only one bit corresponding to its absolute value. At the high rate region, we assume that the partial state information of all channel gains is available at the two transmit sides. The optimality of the proposed scheme is established by deriving an outer bound, which coincides with the achieved DMT.	channel state information;cobham's thesis;code;data rate units;digital monetary trust;gaussian blur;interference (communication);multiplexing;scheme;transmitter	Hamid Ebrahimzad;Amir K.

To provide reliable spectrum awareness, it is critical to develop (near-) optimal sensing techniques and understand achievable performance limits. In this paper, we study likelihood ratio test (LRT)-based methods for detection of a signal of interest (SOI) assuming multiple receive antennas in the presence of spatially correlated additive noise (colored noise). We show that with on/off status information of the SOI available at receiver, a training-based generalized likelihood ratio test (TB-GLRT) method can be designed which approximates the optimal LRT estimator-correlator (EC) detector. Using the inverse Laplace transform and complex Wishart distribution theory, we derive formulas for detection and false alarm probabilities of both LRT-EC and GLRT schemes. The convergence of the TB-GLRT to the LRT-EC is analyzed and proved based on convergence behaviors of the detectors and their decision statistics. Simulation results verify the analytical convergence properties. In addition, the results illustrate the effects of different system design parameters, and demonstrate that the TB-GLRT scheme can provide substantial performance improvement over several existing GLRT methods.	additive white gaussian noise;cognitive radio;colors of noise;kaplan–meier estimator;long-running transaction;sensor;simulation;systems design;terabyte;utility functions on indivisible goods	Yao Ma;Sintayehu Dehnie;Vasu Chakravarthy	2015	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2015.2429136	detector;convergence;telecommunications;computer science;noise;mathematics;wireless;statistics;computer network	Mobile	49.428303070892156	86.50173012388312	22095

STBC provides diversity gain but does not provide multiplexing gain. On the other hand, VBLAST provides multiplexing gain but does not provide diversity gain. But combination of STBC and VBAST scheme such as MLSTBC and HYBRID-STBC-VBLAST provide both diversity and multiplexing gain. So, it is possible to improve the capacity of second hop for a relay assisted multiple access channel maintaining the reliability of system by using MLSTBC or Hybrid-STBC-VBLAST. The capacity of whole system also increases for using MLSTBC and HYBRID-STBC-VBLAST at relay. An adaptive MIMO transmission approach among STBC, VBLAST, MLSTBC and Hybrid-STBC-VBLAST is also proposed based on the capacity for relay assisted multiple access communication. The proposed scheme compares the capacity of STBC, VBLAST, MLSTBC and Hybrid-STBC-VBLAST at destination and selects the MIMO mode for highest capacity and sends feedback to the relay with two extra signaling bits. It consists of users where each user transmits STBC encoded information from two transmit antennas. STBC or VBLAST or MLSTBC or Hybrid-STBC-VBLAST is used depending on the feedback bits to re-encode the information at relay. Simulation and analytical results are presented to show the performance of the proposed system.	encode;mimo;multiplexing;rayleigh fading;relay;simulation	M. M.

This treatment closely parallels the corresponding development in lossless compression, a point of view that was advanced in an important paper of Wyner and Ziv in 1989. In the lossless case, we review how the AEP underlies the analysis of the Lempel–Ziv algorithm by viewing it as a random code and reducing it to the idealized Shannon code. This also provides information about the redundancy of the Lempel–Ziv algorithm and about the asymptotic behavior of several relevant quantities. In the lossy case, we give various versions of the statement of the generalized AEP and we outline the general methodology of its proof via large deviations. Its relationship with Barron and Orey’s generalized AEP is also discussed. The lossy AEP is applied to i) prove strengthened versions of Shannon’s direct sourcecoding theorem and universal coding theorems; ii) characterize the performance of “mismatched” codebooks in lossy data compression; iii) analyze the performance of pattern-matching algorithms for lossy compression (including Lempel–Ziv schemes); and iv) determine the first-order asymptotic of waiting times between stationary processes. A refinement to the lossy AEP is then presented, and it is used to i) prove second-order (direct and converse) lossy source-coding theorems, including universal coding theorems; ii) characterize which sources are quantitatively easier to compress; iii) determine the second-order asymptotic of waiting times between stationary processes; and iv) determine the precise asymptotic behavior of longest match-lengths between stationary processes. Finally, we discuss extensions of the above framework and results to random fields.	approximation algorithm;asymptotic equipartition property;codebook;data compression;distortion;first-order predicate;lz77 and lz78;lempel–ziv–stac;lossless compression;lossy compression;parallels desktop for mac;pattern matching;rate–distortion theory;refinement (computing);shannon (unit);stationary process;universal code (data compression)	Amir Dembo;Ioannis Kontoyiannis	2002	IEEE Trans.

d44c3ce7985413b3d36d0377ff69c2acf23c0789	asymptotic equivalent performance of uplink massive mimo systems with phase noise		Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with a large number of base station (BS) antennas can provide significant spectral and energy efficiency. However, phase noise introduced by the impairment of oscillators can cause a severe performance loss in wireless communication systems. In this paper, we study the effect of phase noise on uplink MIMO systems with imperfect channel state information. We consider a setup that the BS employs different numbers of free- running oscillators. The asymptotic equivalent (AE) expressions of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for matched filter (MF) and minimum mean squared error (MMSE) receivers are derived by using random matrix theory, respectively. Based on the AE expressions, we show that the system performance degrades as the number of oscillators increases. Then, we demonstrates a phase noise impact comparison between the MF and MMSE receivers. The MF receiver shows greater robustness but a lower sum rate performance than the MMSE receiver under the effect of phase noise. Moreover, we investigate the relationship between the sum rate gain and the data transmission interval. Due to the phase noise, the length of the data transmission interval is limited. The derived AE expressions provide valuable insights on the effect of various parameters on the system performance and the optimum choice of the data transmission interval length.	asymptote;channel state information;interference (communication);mimo;matched filter;mean squared error;oscillator (cellular automaton);phase noise;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;telecommunications link	Yuan Fang;Xinmin Li	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2018.8422265	mimo;channel state information;real-time computing;telecommunications link;phase noise;data transmission;matched filter;minimum mean square error;computer science;topology;signal-to-noise ratio	Mobile	38.75520924527407	80.1129467731344	22263

We propose a dual-frequency continuous wave (CW) radio holography method for evaluating radio wave propagation environments for such LANs. Our method images the propagation environment with higher resolution (1 ns or less) and higher sensitivity (10 dBDVV/m) than convenconventional techniques which use frequencymodulated CWs (FMCWs), pseudonise (PN) codemodulated waves, or pulse-modulated waves. A narrowband technique virtually eliminates the measurement inaccuracy caused by frequency response dispersion which is often a problem in conventional methods. This paper introduces the new radio wave propagation observation method by presenting examples of indoor propagation images and delay profiles observed at around 18 CHz.	chrome web store;frequency response;holography;modulation;multipath propagation;radio wave;software propagation	Hitoshi Kitayoshi	1994		10.1109/VETEC.1994.345220	frequency response;electronic engineering;dispersion;resolution;image resolution;continuous wave;telecommunications;sensitivity;line-of-sight propagation;wave propagation;radio propagation;radio wave;holography	Mobile	26.37131916607893	77.19305107821017	22352

The focus of the paper is the cooperative retransmission scenario, where a set of randomly located base stations that are selected based on their average received powers, possibly belonging to different network tiers, jointly transmit data in each transmission. If a decoding error occurs in the first transmission, data is cooperatively retransmitted by a possibly different set of BSs, such that the receiver can benefit from spatiotemporal BS cooperation. Using tools from stochastic geometry, the coverage probability at the typical user is characterized as an integral function of the network parameters and the sets of cooperating BSs. An integral expression for the coverage probability is also derived for the case when the typical user is able to perform maximum ratio combining (MRC) of the received copies in two transmissions. Numerical evaluation shows that in the high coverage regime spatiotemporal cooperation outperforms joint transmission with no retransmissions and that the gains extend to all regimes if the user has MRC capability.	cooperative mimo;interference (communication);randomness;retransmission (data networks)	Gaurav Nigam;Paolo Minero;Martin Haenggi	2014	2014 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7037025	telecommunications;computer science;interference;fading;statistics;computer network	Mobile	29.694753018283013	84.49358165582335	22362

The authors first propose a system model for symbol detection for the multiple H-ARQ processes, and then discuss joint and separate detection algorithms for both multiple H-ARQ and single H-ARQ. Simulation results show that with linear detection the single H-ARQ outperforms multiple H-ARQ in the high signal-to-noise ratio region. With the vertical Bell Labs space-time (V-BLAST) architecture, multiple H-ARQ always outperforms single H-ARQ.

Detecting the activity pattern correctly has severe impact on the system performance and is therefore of major concern. In contrast to previous work, in this paper we optimize joint activity and data detection in under-determined systems by minimizing the Bayes-Risk for erroneous activity detection. We formulate a new Compressed Sensing Bayes-Risk detector which directly allows to influence error rates at the activity detection dynamically by a parameter that can be controlled at higher layers. We derive the detector for a general linear system and show that our detector outperforms classical Compressed Sensing approaches by investigating an overloaded CDMA system.	activity recognition;basis pursuit;compressed sensing;linear system;modulation;sensor	Fabian Monsees;Carsten Bockelmann;Dirk Wübben;Armin Dekorsy	2013	2013 IEEE 77th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2013.6692486	code division multiple access;risk management;telecommunications;computer science;pattern recognition;compressed sensing;detection theory	Mobile	52.138200029734755	85.79247843886017	22378

The potential of exploiting this structure in training based schemes is studied using a common ray-based channel model that captures parts of the structure observed in measurements. A lower bound, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRB), on the channel estimation error and a lower bound on the capacity are used to study the potential gain in exploiting channel structure. It is found that the training based capacity may be substantially increased since a more parsimonious channel model with fewer parameters to estimate can be used. Numerical evaluations indicate that the capacity grows with the number of antennas, similar to the case of a known channel if the structure is exploited. If it is not exploited, the training-based capacity reaches a maximum after which it decreases with the number of antennas. Furthermore, the temporal structure can be used to interpolate or predict the channel between training instants and it is found that prediction can improve performance for training based schemes.	channel (communications);channel state information;interpolation;mimo;occam's razor	Thomas Svantesson;Bhaskar D.

In VCN, the transmitted signal from a mobile terminal is relayed via multi-hop links to the central port, which is the gateway to the core network. With the use of a routing algorithm based on the total uplink transmit power minimization criterion, the total transmit power of all the multi-hop links between the mobile terminal and the central port can be significantly reduced, in comparison with the present (single-hop) cellular network. Reducing the transmit power per communication contributes to reducing the interference power and hence the system capacity may be enlarged. In this paper, an """"on-demand"""" channel assignment strategy, using the channel segregation dynamic channel allocation (CS-DCA) algorithm, is proposed for multi-hop DS-CDMA VCN.

Such CMI severely degrades the bit error rate (BER) performance of energy detector (ED) receivers. To alleviate the adverse effect of CMI, in this letter we propose an enhanced energy detector (E-ED) combined with block-orthogonal-coded PPM (BOC-PPM). Each PPM frame is chopped into several sub-windows and the outputs of sub-windows are combined to form the decision statistic. The optimum combining scheme is derived based on the maximum likelihood (ML) criteria. Through analysis and simulations, we show that E-ED can significantly suppress CMI and thus performs well in the CMI region.	bit error rate;computation;computer memories inc.;interference (communication);intermodulation;microsoft windows;modulation;multipath propagation;offset binary;simulation;ultra-wideband	Xiantao Cheng;Yong Liang Guan	2009	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2009.090060	block code;telecommunications;ultra-wideband;mathematics;maximum likelihood;statistics	Mobile	44.88687327703402	76.72625719411926	22429

In this paper the impact of beamforming (BF) and cell discontinuous transmission (cell DTX) technologies on the average area power consumption is studied. The required density of base stations for a 5G cellular system in a rural environment is also investigated. For this purpose, we propose a simple rural area model that captures a non-uniform distribution of users and employ the generalized Lloyd algorithm to determine the deployment of base stations. We assume a 5G system operating in mmWave band centered at 28 GHz with the bandwidth of 100 MHz, compared with existing LTE networks at 0.8 GHz with a 20 MHz bandwidth. Simulation results show that for the 5G network the density of base stations needed to provide 50 Mbps for 95% of users at the busy hour will be reduced by 8-9 times with the implementation of BF. It is also observed that BF has a greater effect on the energy saving of 5G networks in rural areas in comparison to the cell DTX.	algorithm;beamforming;brainfuck;compaq lte;dtx (form factor);data rate units;discontinuous transmission;interference (communication);marginal model;population;propagation delay;prospective search;simulation;software deployment;software propagation	Alexander Karlsson;Osama Al-Saadeh;Anton Gusarov;Renuka Venkata Ramani Challa;Sibel Tombaz;Ki Won Sung	2016	2016 IEEE 12th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)	10.1109/WiMOB.2016.7763258	simulation;quality of service;telecommunications;gain;computer science;operating system;mobile computing;computational model;statistics;computer network	Mobile	25.21701261140984	85.47556283820882	22445

An array of polarimetric antennas, each composed of three orthogonal electric dipoles and three orthogonal magnetic dipoles in which all six elements are co-located, is used throughout this paper. For a K-user LOS IC with single polarization, the maximum achievable MUXG is only K, regardless of the number of transmit and receive antennas at each node due to the key-hole effect. If polarimetric antennas are used at each node, a trivial upper bound on the MUXG is now 2K. In this paper, we consider zero-forcing (ZF) and interference alignment (IA) schemes to achieve this upper bound. We show the optimal MUXG of 2K is achievable if M ≥ ((K+1)/6) polarimetric antennas are used at each node for any K. In addition, using the proposed ZF scheme, we obtain minimal dipole configurations at each node that achieve this upper bound for K <; 5. Furthermore, we analyze achievable MUXGs using the distributed interference alignment (DIA) algorithm. Although IA can generally provide a higher MUXG than ZF for LOS ICs, we observe that the number of required dipole elements to achieve the optimal MUXG of 2K under a ZF scheme is the same as that required under IA for all cases we consider.	algorithm;dipole antenna;fractal antenna;interference (communication);line-of-sight (missile);mimo;polarimetry;polarization (waves);upwind scheme;wavelength-division multiplexing;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding	Sung Ho Chae;Sang Won Choi;Sae-Young Chung	2011	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2011.081711.100126	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;integrated circuit;degrees of freedom	Metrics	31.791872505989286	77.71820337355264	22473

We first study the functional properties of this problem and show that the objective is concave in the source and noise densities and convex in the density of the input to the channel. We then present the necessary conditions for optimality of the encoder and decoder mappings. A well known result in information theory pertains to the linearity of optimal encoding and decoding mappings in the scalar Gaussian source and channel setting, at all channel signal-to-noise ratios (CSNRs). In this paper, we study this result more generally, beyond the Gaussian source and channel, and derive the necessary and sufficient condition for linearity of optimal mappings, given a noise (or source) distribution, and a specified power constraint. We also prove that the Gaussian source-channel pair is unique in the sense that it is the only source-channel pair for which the optimal mappings are linear at more than one CSNR value. Moreover, we show the asymptotic linearity of optimal mappings for low CSNR if the channel is Gaussian regardless of the source and, at the other extreme, for high CSNR if the source is Gaussian, regardless of the channel.	channel capacity;concave function;distortion;encoder;forward error correction;information theory;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;signal-to-noise ratio	Emrah Akyol;Kumar Viswanatha;Kenneth Rose;Tor A.

This paper is concerned with the detection of equalization errors (i.e., errors in transmitted symbol estimates) in a blindfolded manner whereby no direct access to the channel input is required. The detection problem is cast into a binary hypothesis testing framework. Assuming a linear communication channel that is time-invariant during the test interval, a relationship between the presence of equalization errors and time variations in the underlying linear model taking the transmitted symbol estimates to the equalizer input is established. Based on this relationship, a uniformly most powerful test is constructed to detect the presence of equalization errors in finitelength observations. Finite sample size and asymptotic detection performance of the test is studied. A method for estimating the equalization delay without direct access to the channel input is developed. The effectiveness of the test is illustrated by way of computer simulations.	channel (communications);computer simulation;equalization (communications);linear model;maxima and minima;propagation of uncertainty;random access;software propagation;time-invariant system	Kutluyil Dogançay;Rodney A.

The need for extension of previously stated design criteria for DUSTM is demonstrated by DUSTSM achieving full spectral efficiency with good bit error rate (BER) performance in a Rayleigh flat fading channel despite an effective multicylic group construction. Two cases for two different data rates and number of transmit antennas are illustrated in which the performance of DUSTSM exceeds that of DUSTM.

The estimation performance in terms of mean squared error and lock-in probability is compared to comparable estimators presented in the literature. It is shown through simulation that the proposed estimator performs better than comparable methods for low signal-to-noise ratio in Rayleigh fading channels, especially for higher order channels.	broadcast delay;carrier frequency offset;frequency divider;mean squared error;multipath propagation;multiplexing;national executive committee for space-based positioning, navigation and timing;rayleigh fading;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;slater-type orbital	Rohan Ramlall	2013	MILCOM 2013 - 2013 IEEE Military Communications Conference	10.1109/MILCOM.2013.22	electronic engineering;telecommunications;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	49.93373485003719	77.80784147779679	22603

No side information on the state of the channel is assumed at the receiver. Rather, periodic reference signals are postulated in accordance with the functioning of most wireless systems. In contrast with most previous studies, which relied on block-fading channel models, a continuous-fading model is adopted. This embeds the Doppler spectrum directly in the derived expressions thereby imbuing them with practical significance.	low-power broadcasting;spectral efficiency	Angel Lozano	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2008.248	spectrum;telecommunications;computer science;rayleigh fading;spectral density;fading;wireless;statistics;spectral efficiency	Robotics	40.71199548561645	78.18065152316606	22651

To alleviate this problem, the authors develop some basis expansion model (BEM)-based estimation schemes for the OFDMA uplink. Specifically, the authors express the time-varying channel as a superposition of a small number of complex exponential basis functions spanning the entire Doppler range, and then formulate least square (LS) and linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) algorithms to estimate the basis coefficients for two different types of pilot patterns. The authors also derive the respective Cramer-Rao lower bounds for these estimators. It has been shown that the time domain BEM using a pilot scheme where pilots are placed over time axis will give better performance under a high Doppler scenario. Lastly, using simulation results, the proposed algorithms have been found to have better estimation accuracy over current frequency domain estimation techniques. This is in addition to the advantage that the proposed algorithms have in general a lower computational complexity.	channel state information;frequency divider	Mohammad Fazle Rabbi;Shengwei Hou;C. C.

The robustness of IA in such operationally relevant conditions is assessed through a joint optimization of the pilot overhead and the IA update interval, which are characterized - in high-power conditions - as solutions of a fixed-point equation. Variations of the formulation are given for both frequency-division duplexing (FDD) and time-division duplexing, the former requiring explicit feedback of the fading estimates and the latter relying on fading reciprocity. For the FDD variation, analog feedback is considered. In addition to arbitrary numbers of users and antennas and arbitrary temporal fading correlation functions, the derivations accommodate forward and reverse links with asymmetric power levels.	duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);mathematical optimization;overhead (computing);spectral efficiency	Ratheesh Kumar Mungara;Geordie George;Angel Lozano	2014	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2014.2327217	fading distribution;real-time computing;telecommunications;channel state information;fading	Visualization	37.279667007563646	80.70032261109664	22710

However, it is difficult to extract an estimate of the time-of-arrival (TOA) through use of a simple correlator due to degradation on correlation, and in the case where the pulse repetition interval (PRI) is less than the maximum excess delay (MED). In order to enhance the correlation capability, this paper proposes a TOA estimation method that obeys a threshold predetermined in a non-coherent system using multiple-mask operation (MMO). The performance of the proposed scheme is verified by conducting simulations under two different types of channel situations. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme performs well even in a dense indoor multipath environment and with the existence of multiple simultaneously operating piconets (SOPs).	coherence (physics);ultra-wideband	Woon-Yong Park;Sungsoo Choi;Won-Cheol Lee	2008	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietfec/e91-a.10.3067	real-time computing;telecommunications;time domain;computer science;time of arrival;pulse repetition frequency	Visualization	52.319789878096586	78.04002256740878	22712

The network consists of statistically independent noisy channels. The sink bit error probability (BEP) is the performance measure. We first discuss soft-decision decoding without statistical information on the upstream channels (the channels not directly connected to the sink). The example shows that the decoder cannot significantly improve the BEP from the hard-decision decoder. We develop the union bound to analyze the decoding approach. The bound can show the asymptotic (regarding SNR: signal-to-noise ratio) performance. Using statistical information of the upstream channels, we then show the method of maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding. With the decoder, a significant improvement in the BEP is obtained. To evaluate the union bound for the ML decoder, we use an equivalent signal point procedure. It can be reduced to a least-squares problem with linear constraints for medium-to-high SNR.	algorithm;bit error rate;code word;decoding methods;least squares;linear network coding;noisy-channel coding theorem;profiling (computer programming);signal-to-noise ratio;soft-decision decoder	Ming Xiao;Tor Aulin	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2007.1011	independence;linear network coding;soft-decision decoder;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;maximum likelihood;signal-to-noise ratio;encoding;statistics	Robotics	38.55744669372895	67.80247769173525	22726

The criterion of optimization is the capacity. We apply an optimization algorithm based on Brent’s method. Hence, we employ parabolic interpolation for finding the optimum whenever possible in order to achieve a faster convergence. If parabolic interpolation is not suitable, we use golden section search which is a robust root-finding method. Optimization takes place in two steps. First, we optimize power allocation and consider time as parameter. Second, time is optimized. We demonstrate that, depending on the cooperation strategy, remarkable capacity gains over direct transmission can be achieved by multi-routing. However, for a high overall transmission power, direct transmission outperforms multi-hopping. Generally, capacity gains increase with decreasing overall system power, which demonstrates that relaying is beneficial for low overall transmission powers.	frequency-hopping spread spectrum;interpolation;mathematical optimization;maximal set;numerical analysis;parabolic antenna;program optimization;rayleigh fading;relay;root-finding algorithm;routing	Tobias Renk;Dimitar Iankov;Friedrich Jondral	2009	VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073366	electronic engineering;telecommunications;gain;interpolation;resource allocation;computer science;engineering;resource management;rayleigh fading;mathematics;wireless;statistics;computer network;brent's method	EDA	35.25317970978852	86.64932946465828	22788

Under the HSR scenario, one of the promising solutions to improve the throughput is multi-stream beamforming. However, severe performance degradation occurs due to larger inter-beam interference (IBI) as the number of beams is constant. In order to maximize the throughput, a massive multiple input and multiple output (MIMO)-based adaptive multi-stream beamforming scheme is proposed, which utilizes an adaptive beam-selection proposal by exploiting the location information of the train. By adaptively selecting the optimal subset of beams, including active subset size and active receive antenna indices, with respect to the location of the train, the proposed scheme significantly outperforms single/dual-stream beamforming and conventional massive MIMO. We also find that the throughput is not proportional to, but a nonlinear function of, the number of active receive antennas in this scenario.	beamforming;elegant degradation;hierarchical state routing;interference (communication);mimo;nonlinear system;spectral density;throughput	Yaping Cui;Xuming Fang	2015	EURASIP J.

abff997fbd49ef834de166451512c78767dac86c	design of polar coding for gfdm system		In this paper, polar coding is combined with the generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) and the channel polarization idea is extended to the GFDM system, which is a flexible multicarrier modulation scheme proposed for future waveform. First, the framework of polar coded GFDM (PC-GFDM) is constructed based on a two-stage channel polarization transform. In the first stage, on the basis of bit-interleaved code modulation, GFDM channel is divided into a set of parallel binary-input GFDM synthesized channels. In the second stage, by using the binary channel polarization, the GFDM synthesized channels are further polarized into a set of bit polarized channels. The polar codes are efficiently constructed by calculating the reliabilities of the two-stage polarized channels. Then, an empirically optimal interleaver is designed for PC-GFDM. Furthermore, regarding the features of GFDM synthesized channels, a simplified block interleaving scheme is proposed to approach the optimal interleaver and reduce the implementation complexity. Compared with the conventional turbo coded GFDM (TC-GFDM), simulation results indicate that our proposed PC-GFDM system can outperform the TC-GFDM system by at least 1dB for different scenarios.	forward error correction;frequency divider;mathematical optimization;modulation;multiplexing;polar code (coding theory);polarization (waves);simulation;waveform	Yan Li;Jincheng Dai;Kai Niu;Chao Dong	2017	2017 IEEE 28th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2017.8292350	real-time computing;frequency-division multiplexing;modulation;computer science;waveform;binary number;interleaving;electronic engineering;polar;polarization (waves);communication channel	Arch	45.97816868773825	66.50884805752682	22871

Two FTN broadcasting approaches, namely, sub-FTN and full-FTN, are considered for broadcasting of K independent messages over K-user continuous time Gaussian broadcast channel. The derived achievable rate regions of the two approaches are shown to be, in general, greater than the capacity region of the optimally coded Nyquist-rate broadcasting using a same modulating pulse. The full-FTN broadcasting provides larger degrees of freedom (capacity pre-log factor) to each user of the broadcast channel while the sub-FTN improves signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratios of the individual link. The amount of capacity gains in high SNR regime is linearly proportional to excess bandwidth in the modulating pulse used and dependent on FTN signaling rates, channel SNRs, and number of users in the broadcast channel. The simulated sub-FTN and full-FTN broadcast transceivers outperform coded Nyquist-rate systems both in BER performances and in capacity.	interference (communication);multiplexing;nyquist rate;offset binary;performance;signal-to-noise ratio;transceiver;x.690	Yong Jin Daniel Kim;Jan Bajcsy;David Vargas	2016	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2521821	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	37.90720542303989	74.06271624410964	22909

In particular, they showed that reliable communication is possible for all rates with code words that extend over a single coherence interval when the number of transmit antennas and coherence interval ( ) . They coined the names “ autocoding” for this phenomenon and “autocapacity” for . They also proposed a signalling scheme based on random unitary matrices that achieves a significant fraction of this capacity. The main limitation, however, is that currently no decoder of reasonable complexity is known for this signalling scheme. In this paper, we investigate the application of space-time layering to autocoding. We show that properly constructed layered systems can achieve the autocapacity with a reasonable complexity receiver composed of minimum mean-square error (MMSE) decision feedback multiuser detectors and single user decoders. In addition to this asymptotic result, we propose a specific layering approach, the threaded space-time layering, that combines generalized bit interleaved space-time coded modulation, iterative signal processing and pilot symbol assisted channel estimation. We show that this approach is well suited for practical systems with limited numbers of transmit antennas and small coherence intervals. Finally, we report simulation results that demonstrate the ability of the threaded approach to achieve significant fractions of the autocapacity with a realizable receiver. The simulation results also indicate significant performance gains over the recently proposed Cayley differential space-time signalling scheme in certain scenarios.	channel state information;code word;iteration;mimo;magma;modulation;multi-user;protocol stack;sensor;signal processing;simulation	Hesham El Gamal	2002	IEEE Trans.

They all have the capability of canceling the inter-code interference (ICI) and the multiple access interference (MAI) that is generated by the frequency selective PL channel. Practical estimation of the channel, and mitigation of impulse noise is also addressed. When channel coding is used, we also show that iterative techniques with feedback from the decoder better the channel estimation and detection performance. Simulation results prove that the scheme achieves high data rates in a PL channel in the presence of impulsive noise and MAI.	algorithm;channel capacity;channel state information;convolutional code;forward error correction;frequency response;full rate;ici (programming language);impulse noise (audio);infinite impulse response;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);iterative method;modem;modulation;multiplexing;power-line communication;radar signal characteristics;selectivity (electronic);signal processing;simulation;transmitter;x.690;xfig	Andrea M.

Interleaved frequency division multiple access (IFDMA), whose transmitted signal is generated in the time domain, is a candidate of SC-FDMA. The number of comb like spectrum and the spectral interval between each spectrum depend on the number of transmission data symbols Q in one IFDMA block and repetition number L. In the case of large Q and small L, large frequency diversity gain can be obtained due to the number of spectrum is increased. However, inter-chip interference (ICI) owing to the multipaths environment increases. In the multi-user environment, it is difficult to get multi-user diversity due to the decrease of the degree of freedom for channel allocation to each user with large Q and small L. On the other hand, in the case of small Q and large L, frequency diversity gain becomes smaller and ICI is decreased. Furthermore, multi-user diversity gain can be obtained due to the increase of the degree of the freedom for channel allocation. Thus, it is quite interesting to see how the parameters in IFDMA, i.e., Q and L, affect the average bit error rate (BER) performance in the multi-user environment. In this paper, we derive average BER performance of IFDMA in the multi-user environment theoretically by taking into account of frequency diversity, multi-user diversity and ICI when Q and L are changed and then average BER performance of IFDMA is compared to that of OFDM. In addition, the validity of the theoretical analysis is confirmed by computer simulation.	bit error rate;carrier frequency;catastrophic interference;computer simulation;eb-eye;eb/n0;frequency divider;ici (programming language);interference (communication);multi-user;telecommunications link;user interface;x.690	Yuichi Kazama;Akira Yamasaki;Koichi Adachi;Masao Nakagawa	2010	2010 IEEE 71st Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2010.5493908	computer simulation;spectrum;electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;bit error rate;telecommunications;gain;time domain;computer science;engineering;resource management;diversity scheme;interference;degrees of freedom;wireless;signal generator	Mobile	43.08562133550807	81.26031593862051	22987
a18abf8da99dcbbe89749489af35d93606e07793	fade margins for soft and hard handoffs	base station;soft handoff;wireless systems	A particularly attractive feature of CDMA wireless systems proposed in the Telecommunication Industry Association's standard IS-95 [1] is their ability to get into what is known as ”soft handoff”. A mobile in soft handoff maintains simultaneous radio links with multiple base-stations which enables it to make use of the best quality leg most of the time. This is believed to result in a reduction of the fade margin that is needed to provide the desired coverage in a given geographical area in the presence of log-normal shadow fading. This paper presents an analysis of fade margins for systems allowing soft handoffs (e.g. CDMA) and those where only hard handoffs are possible (e.g. FDMA, TDMA).

344e032a7b86b716c1d5f1aaa79af50733487afa	adaptive dual color visible light communication (vlc) system		In this work, we propose a Visible Light Communication (VLC) system dynamically adapting, through a decision-making process based on a simple fuzzy-logic, the transmitting color selection to the external environmental conditions. Transmitted Signals are opportunistically treated through softwarization approaches by using basic hardware (i.e. Arduino boards and inexpensive LEDs in the transmitting stage) in order to implement an effective, end-to-end, adaptive communication system. In particular, we will show that, if a low environmental noise is added, the system keeps to be well-performing in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER) also at higher distances (up to 8–9 m) using a warm white front-end, while, if high external interfering lights are present in the environment, a low power red front end is dynamically fed for maintaining a good-level communication (with low Bit Error Rate).	vlc media player	Antonio Costanzo;Valeria Loscrì;Sandra Costanzo	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-77712-2_143	bit error rate;communications system;signal processing;arduino;light-emitting diode;word error rate;visible light communication;front and back ends;computer science;electronic engineering	Mobile	53.73569385557348	64.25121236167573	23024

This is mainly due to the highly time varying characteristics of the channel. In this paper, it will be shown how free probability can be used for channel capacity estimation in MIMO systems. Free probability has already been applied in various application fields such as digital communications, nuclear physics, and mathematical finance, and has been shown to be an invaluable tool for describing the asymptotic behavior of many large-dimensional systems. In particular, using the concept of free deconvolution, we provide an asymptotically (with respect to the number of observations) unbiased capacity estimator for MIMO channels impaired with noise called the free probability based estimator. Another estimator, called the Gaussian matrix-mean-based estimator, is also introduced by slightly modifying the free-probability-based estimator. This estimator is shown to give unbiased estimation of the moments of the channel matrix for any number of observations. Also, the estimator has this property when we extend to MIMO channels with phase off-set and frequency drift, for which no estimator has been provided so far in the literature. It is also shown that both the free-probability-based and the Gaussian matrix-mean-based estimator are asymptotically unbiased capacity estimators as the number of transmit antennas go to infinity, regardless of whether phase off-set and frequency drift are present. The limitations in the two estimators are also explained. Simulations are run to assess the performance of the estimators for a low number of antennas and samples to confirm the usefulness of the asymptotic results.	channel capacity;computer simulation;deconvolution;free convolution;frequency drift;goto;mimo	Øyvind Ryan;Mérouane Debbah	2008	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2008.927074	u-statistic;efficient estimator;minimax estimator;econometrics;mathematical optimization;minimum-variance unbiased estimator;estimator;delta method;bayes estimator;stein's unbiased risk estimate;trimmed estimator;efficiency;signal processing;mathematics;estimation theory;mathematical finance;consistent estimator;invariant estimator;statistics;rao–blackwell theorem	Metrics	50.32460817281959	71.16840805470797	23110
2fb54b984fc3210672579d960d6e535b392ee61d	enhancing ber performance limit of bch and rs codes using multipath diversity		Modern wireless communication systems suffer from phase shifting and, more importantly, from interference caused by multipath propagation. Multipath propagation results in an antenna receiving two or more copies of the signal sequence sent from the same source but that has been delivered via different paths. Multipath components are treated as redundant copies of the original data sequence and are used to improve the performance of forward error correction (FEC) codes without extra redundancy, in order to improve data transmission reliability and increase the bit rate over the wireless communication channel. For a proof of concept Bose, Ray-Chaudhuri, and Hocquenghem (BCH) and Reed-Solomon (RS) codes have been used for FEC to compare their bit error rate (BER) performances. The results showed that the wireless multipath components significantly improve the performance of FEC. Furthermore, FEC codes with low error correction capability and employing the multipath phenomenon are enhanced to perform better than FEC codes which have a bit higher error correction capability and did not utilise the multipath. Consequently, the bit rate is increased, and communication reliability is improved without extra redundancy.	bch code;bit error rate;channel (communications);error detection and correction;forward error correction;interference (communication);multipath propagation;performance;reed–solomon error correction;software propagation;x.690	Alyaa Al-Barrak;Ali Al-Sherbaz;Triantafyllos Kanakis;Robin Crockett	2017	Computers	10.3390/computers6020021	multipath propagation;error detection and correction;bit error rate;redundancy (engineering);reed–solomon error correction;real-time computing;forward error correction;electronic engineering;bch code;rake receiver;computer science	Networks	44.87921545728676	67.05665937136466	23136

We assume that the network does not have a stringent delay constraint-thus the source and/or the relay continue transmitting until the destination acknowledges successful decoding. We identify rateless coded relaying as the natural choice, where each transmission from the source and/or the relay adds incremental redundancy to help the destination recover the original message. Our proposed protocol utilizes, in conjunction with rateless coding, a combination of the two popular relay cooperation schemes, namely decode-forward and compress-forward. Assuming very limited feedback from the destination, we derive the theoretical performance bounds specifically with binary phase-shift keying. We then implement the rateless coded relaying protocol using Raptor codes. The degree profiles for the Raptor codes are designed to maximize the average throughput-with the design formulated as a convex optimization problem. Using discretized density evolution for asymptotically large block lengths, the optimized codes lose approximately 5% in performance from the theoretical limit, whereas with practical finite block lengths, the performance loss is approximately 9%.	arithmetic coding;channel capacity;convex optimization;decoding methods;direction finding;discretization;duplex (telecommunications);forward error correction;hybrid automatic repeat request;key (cryptography);mathematical optimization;modulation;optimization problem;raptor code;rayleigh fading;relay channel;throughput;transmitter	Momin Uppal;Guosen Yue;Xiaodong Wang;Zixiang Xiong	2010	2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513439	communications protocol;throughput;online codes;telecommunications;computer science;phase-shift keying;rayleigh fading;mathematics;relay channel;raptor code;code;fading;encoding;statistics;computer network	Mobile	33.57582563610635	75.0392115403645	23190

The networks consist of multiple nodes, each of which can be a source, relay, and/or destination. There are two types of relays in the network, i.e., relays with one sample delay (strictly causal relays) and relays without delay (causal relays) whose transmit signal depends not only on the past received symbols but also on the current received symbol. Also, we assume that some nodes can causally use channel state information (CSI) as side information. For the network, we derive a new cut-set bound, which recovers the classical cut-set bound and our previous cut-set bound for causal DMRNs without side information. Using an example of a fading relay channel, we show that the new cut-set bound can be achieved by a simple amplify-and-forward type relaying.	causal filter;causality;channel state information;relay channel	Ihn-Jung Baik;Sae-Young Chung	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings	10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283476	telecommunications;mathematics;channel state information;relay channel;fading;statistics;mimo	Theory	34.739682397475185	72.06781153382293	23256

And the interleaver of DVB-S2 is a simple model with rows-reading columns-writing, wich is convenient for implementation. However, the error performance would be affected by the multi-edge modulated symbols, which can not be eliminated by the original simple interleaver. So in this paper, we focus on the impact of multi-edge LDPC symbols on the performance of the DVB-S2 system, and propose an improved interleaving scheme to prevent the performance degradation caused by the multi-edge modulated symbols. The new interleaving shceme can improve the decoding performance of DVB-S2 BICM system with a little extra computational complexity compared with the original interleaver. Simulation results show that the DVB-S2 BICM system with our proposed interleaver outperforms the traditional system in different code lengths, rates, modulations and channels.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;code rate;column (database);communications satellite;computational complexity theory;dvb-s2;digital video broadcasting;elegant degradation;forward error correction;low-density parity-check code;modulation;multiple edges;simulation	Kangming Jiang;Ying Wang	2011	2011 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2011.6096826	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science	HPC	44.62678466170465	68.253848127518	23341

Therefore, many methods have been proposed to find optimum transmission antenna coefficients to steer omnidirectional beams efficiently. These conventional optimization methods are simple and efficient. However, for massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems, as the number of variables or transmission antenna coefficients to optimize increases, the computation complexity increases exponentially and eventually it is impossible to compute. To solve this problem, we redefine system model by approximation and variable substitution processes to use Fourier transform for analysis. By using these processes, we find new OBF method that is simple and tolerable to the errors inevitably occurred in the processes. Even for the massive MIMO system with hundreds of transmission antennas, the proposed method has only two optimization variables while the conventional methods try to compute hundreds of optimization variables. Moreover we find the values of these two optimization variables asymptotically approaches constant as the number of transmission antennas increases. Therefore, our accomplishment contributes to future analysis for ideal massive MIMO system.	approximation;beamforming;coefficient;computation;mimo;mathematical optimization;open bioinformatics foundation	Seok Ho Won	2016	2016 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)	10.1109/ICTC.2016.7763525	mathematical optimization;3g mimo;electronic engineering;control theory;mathematics	EDA	41.70542095013386	88.42845649677446	23383

ea376a4e4bd0043429cdda1e02df2c73db174610	performances analysis of coherently integrated cpf for lfm signal under low snr and its application to ground moving target imaging		The detection and parameters estimation of linear frequency-modulated (LFM) signal are important for modern radar applications, but they are also challenged by the fact that echo signal is often of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) due to reasons of long imaging distance and/or limited transmitted power, and the target of small size and/or hidden characteristics. To enhance the SNR, in our previous work, a novel coherently integrated cubic phase function (CICPF) was recently developed for the parameters estimation of the multicomponent LFM signal. In the CICPF, the auto-terms are coherently integrated to enhance the performance in the case of low SNR and also to suppress the cross-terms and spurious peaks. In this paper, as an extension of our previous work, the theoretical performance analyses including several important properties and the fast implementation are provided. Furthermore, the asymptotic mean squared error of a CICPF-based estimator as well as the output SNR of a CICPF-based detector are theoretically derived in closed-forms. From the performance point of view, the proposed CICPF attains the Cramer-Rao bound at low input SNR. The complexity analysis also indicates that the CICPF with the nonuniform fast Fourier transform is computationally efficient without needing the interpolation operation and parameter search. Numerical studies of the CICPF confirm the theoretical analysis and demonstrate superior performance of the proposed approach compared with other state-of-the-art approaches, especially under the low-SNR condition.

DMPOM is generated by merging modified pseudo orthogonal M-sequence sets (outer code), bi-orthogonal code and orthogonal M-sequences (inner code). In this paper, bit error rate (BER) of the optical-wireless CSK/asynchronous CDMA is investigated in 2-user communication. Consequently, for the realization of the CSK/CDMA, it is effective to utilize the inner codes generated by different feedback taps.		T.

Our scheme uses the wireless signals that interfere at relay nodes located at the cell edge instead of discarding them. The relays are non-regenerative and apply a space-time code (STC) to the interfered signal. Subsequently, the relays broadcast the coded signals. At the destinations the interfered and ST-coded signals are decoded in two stages. First by decoding the STC, and then by applying successive interference cancellation (SIC). Simulation results for Rayleigh fading channel reveal significant throughput benefits even in the low SNR regime. We also present results for a small-scale LTE-based cellular scenario and we compare our scheme against the Coordinated MultiPoint (CoMP) transmission mode of LTE-A that is based on beamforming.	algorithm;backhaul (telecommunications);beamforming;bell laboratories layered space-time;cell (microprocessor);compaq lte;complex network;ici (programming language);interference (communication);over the air;rayleigh fading;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simplified instructional computer;simulation;throughput	Antonios Argyriou	2014	2014 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2014.6952313	telecommunications;radio resource management;computer network	Mobile	32.88809844316425	81.56190665226005	23496

In this report, a dual-hop decode-amplify-forward DAF transmission system over Nakagami-m fading channel is studied. The DAF relay system is a hybrid of decode-and-forward and amplify-and-forward relay systems that shows the benefits of both decode-and-forward and amplify-and-forward relay systems and is also called hybrid relay system or hybrid DAF relay system. Signal-to-noise ratios and BERs for various system models with varying number of transmit and receive antennas have been discussed. The diversity is achieved in two ways: firstly, by the use of relay and secondly, by the use of multiple antennas at both the transmitter and the receiver. Dual-hop relaying gives better trunking efficiency and with single antenna at the relay site acquisition and antenna structures are much less expensive. The variations in the performance levels when the relay is moved to different locations within the line of sight of the transmitter and the receiver have also been analyzed. BERs with respect to variations in the fading parameter 'm' have also been presented and discussed. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	profiling (computer programming)	Shivali G.

The aim of this paper is to study the analysis of maximal ratio combiner (MRC) in the presence of adjacent cell interference and adjacent channel Interference using outage probability. MRC is a well known signal processing technique in which the received signal at each antenna is weighted by their individual signal-to-interference plus-noise ratios and are coherently combined. Imperfect estimation of the desired user’s channel fading coefficients will be analyzed and the channel fading coefficients will be assumed to be Gaussian distributed. The estimation error will be measured with the help of correlation coefficients between the true fading values and their estimates.	interference (communication);maximal set;power dividers and directional couplers;sun outage	Samala Nagaraju;Vidhyacharan Bhaskar	2016	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-016-3412-8	fading distribution;telecommunications;channel state information;fading	Mobile	39.56251073367464	77.86932879786482	23556

In parallel, scavenging energy from abient radio signals for energy-constrained devices, namelywireless energy harvesting (WEH), has also drawn significant attention. Without relying on external energy supply, the wireless-powered friendly jammer by WEH from legitimate wireless devices is an effective approa ch to prolong their lifetime and gain the flexibility in deploym ents. This paper studies the online optimization of the placementand WEH of a set of friendly jammers in a geographic location with the energy-efficiency (EE) consideration. We adopt a si mple “time switching” protocol where power transfer and jammerassisted secure communications occur in different time blo cks when WEH requests are launched. Our scheme has the following important advantages: 1) The proposed online jammers place ment and interfering power allocation to attack eavesdroppers is the first distributed and scalable solutions within any spec ified geographic region; 2) We model the WEH for jammers as a JAM-NET lifetime maximization problem, where online scheduling algorithms with heterogeneous energy demands of each jamme r (from energy sources) are designed; 3) Under our model, the problem of placing a minimum number of jammers with distancebased power assignments is NP-hard, and near optimal PTAS approximation algorithms are provided; 4) When durations of the eavesdropping and legitimate communicating are availa ble and the scenario is extended to the multi-channels setting, our results are strengthened to see further improved EE and redu ced number of jammers.

To this end a 4 transmit 4 receive antenna system was simulated in order to investigate the effect of equipment imperfections on the estimation of channel parameters, for example, K-factor, power delay profile (PDP), antenna correlation coefficients (ACC) and signal angle of arrival (AOA). The channel employed in the simulation is based on the SUI-3 model [8]. The accuracy of the channel estimation results is dependent upon the frequency offset between the phase lock loop (PLL) reference oscillators used at the transmitter and receiver. Consequently, high cost rubidium reference sources are usually used since they can reduce the frequency offset to almost zero owing to their frequency stability (aging) of about 5times10-10 per year [13], equivalently, 5times10-4 ppm per year. We wish to determine how much frequency offset can be tolerated before the estimation results become unacceptable. To this end we have conducted extensive system simulations that have revealed that acceptable accuracy can be achieved using relatively low performance and therefore inexpensive reference sources.	angle of arrival;arnold tongue;channel state information;coefficient;frequency drift;frequency offset;k-factor (cisco);mimo;phase-locked loop;simulation;transmitter	Min Lin;Ian J.

The proposed algorithm applies different updating schemes, such as the normalized min-sum (NMS) simplification and linear approximation, to the check-node based on its degree. Meanwhile, to eliminate the dependence on the channel variance estimation, the proposed algorithm adopts a multiplicative factor to initialize the channel input and a fixed linear functions for check-node updating. From the iterative thresholds and decoding simulations, our proposed algorithm can be shown to achieve improved performance (much closer to that of the belief propagation decoding) at the expense of a slight increase in complexity to NMS algorithm.	algorithm;belief propagation;coefficient;iterative method;level of detail;linear approximation;linear function;low-density parity-check code;maxima and minima;neuroleptic malignant syndrome;no man's sky;node - plant part;sample variance;simulation;software propagation	K.

Based on the method of the probability density function of the signal-to-noise ratio, the exact expressions for the channel capacity and average symbol error probability (ASEP) are derived. Then the channel capacity and ASEP performance under different conditions is evaluated through numerical simulations to verify the analysis.

The system is constrained by maximum packet loss and end-to-end throughput requirements. For meeting the end-to-end throughput requirement, we assume that the nodes in multi-hop and cooperative transmission schemes operate at a spectral efficiency which is twice that of the single-hop transmission. Our analysis includes the energy consumption of the RF circuitry and contradicts some previous results in the literature, showing that the cooperative transmission may be considerably more energy efficient than the non-cooperative transmission even in small transmission ranges, specially if a feedback channel is available.	cooperative mimo;downtime;electronic circuit;end-to-end principle;network packet;radio frequency;requirement;spectral efficiency;tf–idf;throughput	Glauber Gomes de Oliveira Brante;Marcos Tomio Kakitani;Richard Demo Souza	2011	2011 45th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems	10.1109/CISS.2011.5766227	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;efficient energy use;statistics;computer network	Mobile	32.941662456716855	82.48237669908613	23711

The larger PAPR signal would cause the fatal degradation of BER performance and un-desirable spectrum regrowth in the nonlinear channel. One of the promising PAPR reduction methods is the Partial Transmit Sequence (PTS) method which can achieve better PAPR performance with reasonable computation complexity. But the PTS method is required to inform the side information to the receiver for the correct demodulation of data information by using the separate channel. To solve the above problem, this paper proposes a new PAPR reduction method without requiring the separate channel. The salient feature of the proposed method is to reduce the PAPR performance by reordering of clusters in the frequency domain at the transmitter and reconstructing the clusters by using the cluster ID under embedded in the data information at the receiver. The proposed method can achieve almost the same PAPR performance and computation complexity as those for the PTS method without requiring the transmission of side information.

Previously described methods for performing wireless key generation have not come close to achieving the theoretical upper bounds on key rates theory for this technique. This paper demonstrates how using a Kalman filter based on an auto-regressive (AR) model for the channel process, channel gain measurements can be converted into a sequence of independent Gaussian vectors. Methods for processing these vectors so they are compatible with existing secret key quantization and error reconciliation techniques are also presented.

Moreover, energy efficient operation is critical, since the nodes are typically powered by batteries or scavenge energy from their environment. Communication over a wireless channel is prone to noise and interference, which causes errors to occur in the received packets. Plain retransmission of erroneous packets requires high amounts of energy from the nodes. Error Correcting Codes (ECCs) are commonly used in communication systems to correct erroneous packets at the receiver, at some additional processing power cost for the decoding process. A strong error correction decoder can however be shifted to the data collecting Base Station—which has more processing power and energy available—to correct errors accumulated over the multi-hop communication path. Turbo Codes are commonly used in wireless communication when high error correction performance is required. Turbo Codes can have a Serial Concatenation or a Parallel Concatenation structure. In this paper we evaluate and compare the performance of both structures when using a Turbo decoder at the Base Station to correct the accumulated errors.	code (cryptography);computation;concatenation;data compression;data rate units;error detection and correction;image noise;interference (communication);retransmission (data networks);turbo code	Nashat Abughalieh;Kris Steenhaut;Bart Lemmens;Ann Nowé	2011	2011 18th IEEE Symposium on Communications and Vehicular Technology in the Benelux (SCVT)	10.1109/SCVT.2011.6101314	turbo equalizer;turbo code;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;error floor	Embedded	44.1827287896342	66.3588058129278	23802

Compared to conventional NOMA, the main contributions of bi-directional cooperative NOMA can be explained in two directions: 1) the proposed NOMA system is still efficient when the channel gains of scheduled users are almost the same and 2) the proposed NOMA system operates well without accurate channel-state information at the base station. In a two-user scenario, the closed-form ergodic capacity of bi-directional cooperative NOMA is derived, and it is proven to be better than those of other techniques. Based on the ergodic capacity, the algorithms to find optimal power allocations maximizing the user fairness and sum rate are presented. Outage probability is also derived, and we show that bi-directional cooperative NOMA achieves a power gain over uni-directional cooperative NOMA and a diversity gain over non-cooperative NOMA and orthogonal multiple access (OMA). We finally extend the bi-directional cooperative NOMA to a multiuser model. The analysis of ergodic capacity and outage probability in a two-user scenario is numerically verified. Also, simulation results show that bi-directional cooperative NOMA provides better data rates than the existing NOMA schemes as well as OMA in a multiuser scenario.	algorithm;channel state information;downtime;ergodicity;fairness measure;multi-user;numerical analysis;oma;power gain;scenario (computing);simulation	Minseok Choi;Dong-Jun Han;Jaekyun Moon	2018	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2018.2867877	noma;computer network;mathematics;outage probability;diversity gain;power gain;communication channel	HPC	35.978630260086426	82.01837474234446	23918

They determine the error locator polynomial and compute the error magnitudes, respectively. A recursive algorithm called reformulated inversionless Berlekamp Massey (riBM) algorithm is widely used for the KES block. However, for high rate RS codes, such as single-error-correcting (SEC) and double-error-correcting (DEC) RS codes, a method to find errata patterns directly has been proposed in the literature. We extend the method and derive the direct calculation algorithm for quadruple-error-correcting (QEC) RS codes in this work. An optimized architecture of the proposed algorithm is further developed. The computational complexity is reduced significantly by the proposed direct calculation method. Moreover, the data paths of the proposed architecture are all feed-forward and thus pipelining can be easily employed for high-speed applications.

In order to exploit the IC gain at system level, it is important to design radio resource management algorithms that account for this gain. For this purpose, two new load control algorithms are proposed in this paper, together with some further enhancements. For Algorithm 1, load control and scheduling are still performed based on the air interface Rise over Thermal (RoT), but with an increased RoT target. The RoT target is determined based on the estimated IC gain. A cell-specific and dynamic RoT target is hence used rather than a constant one. With Algorithm 2, load control and scheduling are performed based on an effective RoT without increasing the RoT target. The load control function is placed after an intermediate IC stage depending on the timing constraints and/or the required IC processing gain of the coverage limiting channels. With the proposed algorithms, system-level simulation results show that the average cell throughput can be considerably improved and at the same time the coverage can be maintained at a level similar to a system without IC.	algorithm;interference (communication);load management;multistage amplifier;process gain;radio resource management;scheduling (computing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;software deployment;system-level simulation;telecommunications link;throughput	Xinyu Gu;Zhang Zhang;Stephen Grant;Torbjörn Wigren;Niklas Johansson;Ari Kangas Ericsson	2012	2012 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2012.6362807	throughput;single antenna interference cancellation;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science	Arch	33.063125616254624	88.45764993946682	23969

In this paper, we propose a subsp ace-based spatial signature estimation algorithm of cochannel multiuser signals by jointly exploiting cumulant and cyclostationarity, and apply it to multiuser signal copy in uplink SDMA. Our method constructs a new matrix called spatial signature matrix (SS Matrix), and estimates multiuser spatial signature through the eigendecomposition of the SS Matrix. Based on estimated spatial signature, a spatial filter bank is designed for cochannel multiuser waveform estimation. Computer simulations show that the spatial response of the filter bank can be used to find direction-of-arrival (DOA) of the correlated multiuser signals.	algorithm;automatic computing engine;cyclostationary process;direction of arrival;filter bank;multi-user;sas;simulation;smart antenna;source separation;standard database management analysis;telecommunications link;waveform	Qinye Yin;Minli Yao	1999		10.1109/ICASSP.1999.761359	computer simulation;telecommunications;smart antenna;filter bank;mathematics;direction of arrival;spatial filter;statistics;cumulant	Vision	49.4489248687397	78.5798496667834	23983

We present an iterative feedforward soft-decision-directed phase noise estimation algorithm, that is based on approximating the phase noise process by an expansion of DCT basis functions containing only a few terms. An initial estimate of the phase noise is obtained using pilot symbols inserted in the data sequence. The estimate is iteratively improved by exploiting also soft decisions from the data symbols, obtained in a previous iteration. We demonstrate that the resulting (linearized) mean-square estimation error consists of two contributions: a contribution from the additive noise, that equals the Cramer-Rao lower bound, and a noise-independent contribution that results from the phase noise modeling error. Performance can be optimized by a proper selection of the number of DCT coefficients in the expansion of the phase noise. Iterative soft-decision-directed phase noise estimation yields a considerable performance improvement as compared to estimation using only pilot symbols.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;basis function;coefficient;discrete cosine transform;elegant degradation;feedforward neural network;hoc (programming language);iteration;phase noise;pixel;utility functions on indivisible goods;x.690	Jabran Bhatti;Marc Moeneclaey	2009	2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5450119	gradient noise;gaussian noise;mathematical optimization;estimation;cramér–rao bound;degradation;bit error rate;value noise;errors-in-variables models;mathematics;iterative method;estimation theory;computational model;phase noise;statistics	EDA	47.33257164761182	74.16794464749586	23990

First, we prove that acquiring signals using dense sensing matrices may provide almost perfect secrecy. Then, we prove that using sparse sensing matrices, which admit efficient recovery algorithms mutuated by coding theory, reveals information only on the sparsity of the sensed signal, and that such information is conveyed only by the sparsity of the measurements. Finally, we introduce an operational definition of security, based on the error probability in estimating the signal sparsity, and show that there is a tradeoff between the sparsity of the sensing matrix and the security of the CS system.	algorithm;code;coding theory;compressed sensing;information-theoretic security;internet leak;memory leak;operational definition;parity bit;schedule (computer science);sparse matrix	Valerio Bioglio;Tiziano Bianchi;Enrico Magli	2014	2014 IEEE International Workshop on Information Forensics and Security (WIFS)	10.1109/WIFS.2014.7084326	electronic engineering;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;compressed sensing	Mobile	33.56097349908606	63.93080236401486	24002

We formulate the quantization search operation as a zero–one integer optimization problem, and show that the resulting integer program can be closely approximated by solving a simple linear program. The result is a Lagrange formulation which adjoins the constraint on the entropy (codeword length) to the distortion. Unlike the previously known methods with a fixed Lagrange multiplier, we use an iterative algorithm to optimize the underlying objective function while updating the Lagrange multiplier until the constraint on the overall rate is satisfied. The key feature of the new method is the substantial reduction in the number of iterations, in comparison with previous related methods. In order to achieve some packing gain, we combine the process of trellis-coded quantization with that of FEVQ. This results in an iterative application of the Viterbi algorithm on the underlying trellis for selecting the Lagrange multiplier. Numerical results are presented which demonstrate substantial improvement in comparison with the alternative methods reported in the literature.	vector quantization	Sasan Nikneshan;Amir K.

Extension of this principle with an additional iterative feedback loop to the demapping function has proven to provide substantial error performance gain at the cost of increased complexity. However, this complexity overhead constitutes commonly an obstacle for its consideration in real implementations. This article illustrates the opposite of what is commonly assumed and proposes a complexity adaptive iterative receiver performing iterative demapping with turbo decoding (TBICM-ID-SSD). Targeting identical error rate, the article shows that for certain system configurations TBICM-ID-SSD presents lower complexity than TBICM-SSD (without iterative demapping). This original result is obtained when considering the equivalent number of iterations through detailed analysis of the corresponding computational and memory access complexity. The analysis is conducted for different parameters in terms of modulation orders and code rates and independently from the architecture for a fair comparison. Considering the proposed adaptive receiver which is able to perform both TBICM-ID-SSD and TBICM-SSD modes, results demonstrate a reduced complexity with TBICM-SSD for high modulation orders. However, for low modulation orders as for QPSK, results show a reduction in arithmetic operations and read access memory up to 45.9% and 47%, respectively for using the TBICM-ID-SSD mode rather than TBICM-SSD performing six turbo decoding iterations over Rayleigh fading channel with erasures. Introduction Advanced wireless communication standards impose the use of modern techniques to improve spectral efficiency and reliability. Among these techniques, bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) [1] with different modulation orders and Turbo Codes with various code rates are frequently adopted. The BICM principle currently represents the state-ofthe-art in coded modulations over fading channels. The BICM with iterative demapping (BICM-ID) scheme proposed in [2] is based on BICM with additional soft feedback from the soft-input soft-output (SISO) convolutional decoder to the constellation demapper. In [3], the convolutional code classically used in BICM-ID schemes was replaced by a turbo code. Only a small gain of 0.1 dB was observed. This result makes BICM-ID with turbo-like coding solutions (TBICM-ID) unsatisfactory with respect to the added decoding complexity. *Correspondence: salim.haddad@telecom-bretagne.eu 1Institut Mines-Telecom; Telecom Bretagne; UMR CNRS 3192 Lab-STICC Electronics Department, Technopôle Brest Iroise CS 83818, 29238 Brest, France On the other hand, signal space diversity (SSD) technique, which consists of a rotation of the constellation followed by a signal space component interleaving, has been recently proposed [4,5]. It increases the diversity order of a communication system without using extra bandwidth. Combining SSD technique with TBICM-ID at the receiver side has shown excellent error rate performance results particularly in severe channel conditions (erasure, multi-path, real fading models) [6,7]. These results were behind the adoption of this system in DVB-T2 standard (using LDPC channel code). These results will also lead for further adoption discussions in the upcoming standards using turbo codes [6]. The TBICM and TBICM-ID modes applying the SSD technique are denoted by TBICM-SSD and TBICM-ID-SSD. In fact, almost all related works using these techniques have focused only on error rate performance without considering the implementation perspective. This is due mainly to the commonly assumed impact in terms of complexity overhead. In this article, we demonstrate the © 2012 Haddad et al.; licensee Springer.

In this context, a novel complexity adaptive iterative receiver, performing either in TBICM-ID-SSD mode or in TBICM-SSD mode, is proposed. This original proposal is based on a thorough analysis of the corresponding computational and memory access complexity. It is worth to note that the article does not provide a comparison in terms of area, as one iterative receiver is considered to perform both modes (TBICM-ID-SSD and TBICM-SSD). The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section Systemmodel and algorithms presents the system model with the associated parameters and gives a brief description of the underlined algorithms for iterative demapping and turbo decoding. Section Complexity evaluation and normalization presents an evaluation of the receiver complexity in terms of number and type of arithmetic operations and memory access. Section Number of iterations analysis for identical complexity analyzes the number of TBCIM-SSD and TBCIM-ID-SSD iterations for identical complexity. Section Complexity analysis for identical performance shows a complexity analysis for identical TBCIM-SSD and TBCIM-ID-SSD error rate performances. Finally, Section Conclusion concludes the article. Systemmodel and algorithms This section describes the system model and the considered parameters of the transmitter, channel, and receiver of Figure 1. In addition, it gives a brief presentation of the underlined algorithms for the iterative demapping and decoding. Systemmodel On the transmitter side, information bits U which are called systematic bits are regrouped into symbols ui consisting of q bits, and encoded with an q-binary turbo encoder. It consists of a parallel concatenation of two identical convolutional codes (PCCC). The output codeword C is then punctured to reach a desired coding rate Rc. We consider in this work the 8-state double binary (q = 2) [8] turbo code adopted in the WiMax standard. In order to gain resilience against error bursts, the resulting sequence is interleaved using an S-random interleaver 2 with S = √N/4. Punctured and interleaved bits denoted by vi are then gray mapped to complex channel symbols sq chosen from a 2M-ary constellation X, where M is the number of bits per modulated symbol. Applying the SSD consists first of the rotation of the mapped symbols sq. The resulting rotated symbols are denoted as sr,q. The performance gain obtained when using a rotated constellation Xr depends on the choice of the rotation angle. The optimum rotation angle depends Figure 1 The systemmodel of the transmitter, channel, and TBICM-ID-SSD receiver. Haddad et al.

A single rotation angle [7] has been chosen for each constellation size independently of the channel type. These angle values are presented in Table 1 and are adopted in this work. The second step when applying SSD at the transmitter consists of signal space component interleaving. A simple delay is introduced between the transmission of I and Q components. Mapped and shifted symbols s′r,q are then transmitted over a noisy and Rayleigh fast fading channel with or without erasure. The erasure channel model has been used in the case of the DVB-T2 standard to model the destructive interferences caused by the existence of a single-frequency network (SFN). Each received symbol x′r,q is affected by a different fading coefficient, an erasure coefficient, and an additive Gaussian noise. The channel model considered is a frequency nonselective memoryless channel with erasure probability. The received discrete time baseband complex signal can be written as: x′r,q = hq.ρq.s′r,q + nq = h′q.s′r,q + nq (1) where hq is the Rayleigh fast fading coefficient, ρq is the erasure coefficient probability taking value 0 with a probability Pρ and value 1 with a probability of 1 − Pρ . nq is a complex white Gaussian noise with spectral density N0/2 in each component axes, and h′q is the channel attenuation. Max-log-map demapping algorithm At the receiver side, the complex received symbols x′r,q have their Q-components re-shifted resulting in xr,q. An extrinsic log-likelihood ratio Lext,Dem(ck,q/xr,q) is calculated for each bit ck,q corresponding to the kth bit of the received rotated and modulated symbol xr,q. After deinterleaving, de-puncturing and turbo decoding, extrinsic information from the turbo decoder Lext,Dec(ck,q) is passed through the interleaver, punctured and fed back as a priori information Lapr,Dem(ck,q) to the demapper in a turbo demapping scheme.

Movement, proximity of networks, the large number of nodes per network and the lack of central coordination make cellular approaches to interference modeling ineffective. We examine the interference power of multiple Body Area Networks (BANs) when people move randomly within an indoor office environment. The power-loss trend over 3m is overwhelmed by random variations in the signal power. Distance-to-interferer is a poor estimate of instantaneous received interference power, and an even less reliable estimate of instantaneous signal-to-interference ratio (SIR). We develop a lognormal statistical model for the signal-to-interference which incorporates the distance effect.		Leif Hanlen;Dino Miniutti;David B.

The main conditions are the minimization of additional energy losses while maintaining the information rate. Frequency bandwidth reduction is carried out by means of doubling the duration of the signals used for each subcarrier frequency. The envelope signals are used as a numerical solution of the optimization problem for a given out-of-band emission reduction rate, energy of the signal and cross-correlation coefficient. The simulation showed that, for the cross-correlation coefficient values equal to 10−2, frequency bandwidth decrease of proposed SEFDM signal is 38%, as compared to the OFDM. At the same time, this energy loss, with respect to the OFDM signals, is no more than 1 dB.	waveform	Sergey V. Zavjalov;Sergey B. Makarov;Sergey V.

One is the conventional hard successive interference cancellation (SIC) scheme based on independent single-user decodings. The other two, proposed in this paper, are a soft-in soft-out parallel interference cancellation (SISO-PIC) and a hybrid interference cancellation (HIC). The SISO-PIC is an improved joint iterative multi-user detection scheme, which has lower complexity than the prevalent multi-user detection. The HIC combines the advantages of the above two schemes to permit users to be successively processed by a SISO-PIC window according to their receive power levels. A comprehensive comparison is given for these three schemes in aspects of error propagation, detection delay, and complexity when a practical channel code, repeat-accumulate code, is employed. Numerical results show that HIC is a trade-off scheme of the three aspects.	bell laboratories layered space-time;channel capacity;complexity;interference (communication);iterative method;multi-user;propagation of uncertainty;repeat-accumulate code;simplified instructional computer;simulation interoperability standards organization;soft-in soft-out decoder;software propagation	Guanghui Song;Xianbin Wang	2016	2016 IEEE 83rd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2016.7504172	single antenna interference cancellation;electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;decoding methods;statistics	Mobile	45.0149822200539	78.09350064104758	24173

Ergodic capacity is derived and its lower bound is obtained in closed form. Two schemes of pilot placement in time and frequency domains are proposed which maximizes the lower bound of the ergodic capacity. The ergodic capacities of the two proposed schemes are obtained by computer simulation and compared. It is shown that the proposed schemes achieve higher ergodic capacity than the random pilot placement scheme.	channel capacity;computer simulation;ergodic hypothesis;ergodic theory;ergodicity;frequency divider;hierarchical state routing;multiplexing	Yongyun Choi;Jae Hong Lee	2017	2017 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)	10.1109/EuCNC.2017.7980693	ergodic theory;wireless;control theory;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;channel capacity;random variable;telecommunications;mathematics;upper and lower bounds	EDA	37.78594125918323	80.09617525813783	24225

In this paper, we focus on the design of the Guard Period (GP) which is needed to accommodate the transition between downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) transmissions in a 5G TDD wide area system operating at below 6 GHz carrier frequencies. The necessity of serving cell edge users with long propagation delays while coping with latency constraints may lead to a large GP overhead, thus reducing the resource utilization in the cell. We propose a distance-dependent scheduling technique which is meant at reducing the GP overhead while ensuring sufficient coverage. Numerical analysis shows the benefits of the proposed techniques in terms of available radio resources, especially for very large cells operating with short frames.	carrier wave;cell (microprocessor);duplex (telecommunications);frame language;numerical analysis;overhead (computing);scheduling (computing);software propagation;telecommunications link;test-driven development	Gilberto Berardinelli;Klaus I.

A special subset of the SFH/MFSK format that receives particular attention in the paper is the case of continuous-phase modulation (CPM) for which the carrier phase is assumed to be constant over the entire hop. A fundamental conclusion is that SFW/CPM modulation is advantageous not only to the communicator but also to a sophisticated noncoherent detector. By applying techniques developed in the paper to exploit the continuous-phase characteristic, an intercept receiver of reasonable complexity will perform appreciably better than traditional channelized detectors. >		Barry K.

The primary network consists of Poisson distributed legacy users of density n, and the secondary network consists of Poisson distributed cognitive users of density m, with m >n. The primary users have a higher priority to access the spectrum without particular considerations for the secondary users, while the secondary users have to act conservatively in order to limit the interference to the primary users. With a practical assumption that the secondary users only know the locations of the primary transmitters (not the primary receivers), we first show that both networks can achieve the same throughput scaling law as what Gupta and Kumar (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, vol. 46, no. 2, pp. 388-404, Mar. 2000) established for a standalone wireless network if proper transmission schemes are deployed, where a certain throughput is achievable for each individual secondary user (i.e., zero outage) with high probability. By using a fluid model, we also show that both networks can achieve the same delay-throughput tradeoff as the optimal one established by El Gamal et al. (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, vol. 52, no. 6, pp. 2568-2592, Jun. 2006) for a standalone wireless network.	2.5d;cognitive radio;downtime;image scaling;interference (communication);legacy system;throughput;transmitter;with high probability	Changchuan Yin;Long Gao;Shuguang Cui	2010	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking	10.1109/TNET.2010.2041467	cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	29.403988127550665	83.95446388282313	24289

Moreover, we investigate the effect on the performance of the number of RBF center with two modulation formats (i.e. BPSK and QPSK) and different number of transmit and receive antennas. The performance of the proposed detector is verified with respect to an initialization-rate of RBF centers.	mimo;radial basis function	Kyunbyoung Ko;Taeyoung Kim;Sooyong Choi;Changeon Kang;Daesik Hong	2002		10.1109/GLOCOM.2002.1188116	zero forcing equalizer;minimum mean square error;radial basis function;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;phase-shift keying;control theory;radio receiver;fading	Networks	41.659382159452065	79.9561802186282	24290

The majority of the existing signals detection and classification methods presume that the received signal is corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise. The performance of the modulation classification algorithms degrades severely under the non-Gaussian impulsive noise. Hence, in this paper, we introduce a robust algorithm to identify the modulation type of digital signal contaminated with non-Gaussian impulse noise and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) using a sparse signal decomposition on hybrid dictionary. The algorithm first detects and removes the impulse noise using sparse signal decomposition thereafter it classifies the modulation schemes using cyclostationary feature extraction algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method under different non-Gaussian impulse noise and AWGN conditions. The performance of the proposed classifier is evaluated using well known classifiers available in the literature.	cyclostationary process;modulation;sparse	Udit Satija;Madhusmita Mohanty;Barathram Ramkumar	2017	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-017-4444-4	computer science;noise measurement;cyclostationary process;additive white gaussian noise;digital signal;gaussian noise;impulse noise;white noise;noise (signal processing);artificial intelligence;pattern recognition	ML	49.87161144097118	85.15000426867019	24339

The proposed technique keeping the comb-type pilot arrangement can achieve a low error probability by accurately estimating channel impulse response (CIR) and effectively tracking rapid CIR time variations. The LS CE technique proposed here is conducted in the time domain (TD). Meanwhile, a generic estimator is serially performed block by block without assistance from a priori channel information and without increasing computational complexity. By taking advantage of linearly frequency-modulated (LFM) or pseudorandom signals transceived for jointly sounding pilot subchannels, the proposed LS CE can inherently perform pseudonoise (PN) matched filtering (MF) to suppress multipath interference (MPI) caused by frequency-selective fading and intercarrier interference (ICI) resulting from data subchannels. The optimality of the proposed technique is verified by taking Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) into comparison both on noise- and interference-dominant signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. In addition, the dual optimality of the LFM and PN pilot symbols is verified for both TD and frequency-domain (FD) CEs. Furthermore, the proposed technique also exhibits good resistance against residual timing errors occurring with the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) demodulation. Extensive computer simulations in conjunction with statistical derivations show the superiority of the proposed technique.	automatic sounding;ct pulmonary angiogram;catastrophic interference;channel state information;committed information rate;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;discrete fourier transform;ici (programming language);interference (communication);least squares;modulation;multiplexing;pseudorandom noise;pseudorandomness;signal-to-noise ratio;time series	Jia-Chin Lin	2008	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2008.919611	computer simulation;electronic engineering;speech recognition;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;signal processing;mathematics;matched filter;statistics	Mobile	50.604974961912745	78.9012153748378	24348

Downlink multi-user (MU) transmission with massive MIMO in the time-division duplex (TDD) mode is one of the technologies evaluated in this trial. With linear and non-linear downlink precoding schemes, we investigated the practical performance of MU massive MIMO systems under different numbers of users, user distributions, and different radio frequency channel calibration settings with up to 24 users deployed. When linear precoding is used, the cell spectrum efficiency reaches 39 bit/s/Hz, and it reaches 43 bit/s/Hz when non-linear precoding is used. In term of the cell throughput, up to 1.35 Gbps cell throughput was observed with a linear precoder and 100 MHz bandwidth; and 343 Mbps cell throughput was observed with a non-linear precoder and 20 MHz bandwidth. Based on these investigations, we verified the feasibility and performance of a TDD massive MIMO system for 5G mobile systems, and studied the impact of key factors on the system performance.	bandwidth (signal processing);channel (communications);data rate units;duplex (telecommunications);mimo;multi-user;nonlinear system;radio frequency;software deployment;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;test-driven development;throughput;unreal development kit	Xin Wang;Xiaolin Hou;Huiling Jiang;Anass Benjebbour;Yuya Saito;Yoshihisa Kishiyama;Jing Qiu;Haihua Shen;Chen Tang;Tingjian Tian;Tsuyoshi Kashima	2016	2016 IEEE 27th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2016.7794572	real-time computing;telecommunications	Mobile	26.353720455832622	82.89726793017881	24376
946da894ecab51d10fddee8ead4870c95868974a	the cf-df approach for relay networks based on multiple descriptions with the shared binning		Decode-and-forward (DF) and compress-and-forward (CF) are well-known strategies to transmit information over the relay channel. There are several methods which generalize these strategies to relay networks, among them, the unified CF-DF strategy is one with relatively good performance and less complexity. In this method the nodes are divided into two groups: DF relay nodes and CF relay nodes, where the DF relay nodes fully utilize the help of the CF relay nodes. Here we present a modified CF-DF approach in which the CF relay nodes form multiple description coding. This method let different DF relay nodes and the destination receive the relay observation at different quality levels. In comparison with similar approaches, here the key point is that we use the shared binning for all descriptions at a CF relay node. This strategy reduces the complexity of the obtained achievable rate and yielding the better performance at the same time. Simulation results for Gaussian relay networks show that our proposed achievable rate includes the previously proposed ones.	direction finding;gaussian elimination;multiple description coding;product binning;relay channel;simulation	Leila Ghabeli	2017	2017 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	10.1109/ISIT.2017.8006927	local management interface;computer network;relay channel;computer science;decoding methods;multiple description coding;link access procedure for frame relay;relay	Mobile	34.15853390218455	75.31656119595895	24380

Sequential importance resampling (SIR) is used to estimate the state of the GFSK signal, while a low complex detection algorithm is used to decide on the received bit. SIR is the original and most used particle filtering algorithm, which approximates the filtering distribution by a weighted set of particles. The bit error rate (BER) analysis is used as the performance metrics of the proposed receiver at the physical layer. Applying SMC technique to GFSK demodulator shows significant performance improvement compared to several other existing techniques that are presented in the literature. In addition, it does not require a pre-detection filter, which is usually used to reject out-of-band interference. Simulation results show approximately 6 dB of BER improvement over the commonly used limiter discriminator with an integrator (LDI) receiver.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;bit error rate;bluetooth;decibel;discriminator;interference (communication);key (cryptography);limiter;matlab;modulation;noise (electronics);out-of-band agreement;particle filter;sensor;simulation;x.690	Alhaj-Saleh Abdallah;Ahmad Nsour;Mohamed A.

In such a system, a carrier frequency offset (CFO) disrupts the orthogonality between the subcarriers and gives rise to MAI among users. Based on the signature vector formulated for each user, we propose a novel detector that performs MAI suppression before CFO compensation and fast Fourier transform (FFT) demodulation. Subspace zero-forcing and minimum mean square error (MMSE) techniques are then developed to suppress MAI. The proposed scheme is shown to become almost MAI free, provided that the CFO estimation is accurate enough. From the obtained simulation results, the proposed scheme is also found to be able to enhance the system performance at low complexity.	carrier frequency offset;fast fourier transform;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);kernel density estimation;mean squared error;simulation;subcarrier;telecommunications link;zero suppression	Shengwei Hou;Chi Chung Ko	2008	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2007.901894	fast fourier transform;electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;computer performance	Robotics	50.45565262642134	73.3742475840041	24483

Simple closed-form bounds are obtained for the bit-error rate of binary phase-shift keying modulation in the presence of cochannel interference in systems using sample matrix inversion (SMI) and the eigencanceler. The application of SMI and the eigencanceler to a flat fading time-division multiple-access system is studied in the context of the IS-54/IS-136 standard. It is shown that adaptive antennas in conjunction with reduced-rank processing can be used to increase capacity of such systems by reducing the frequency reuse factor from 7 to 1.	array processing	Alexander M.

Two receiver circuits are used with a single laser input. The current outputs of two receivers were combined using equal gain combining (EGC) scheme and compared with single input single output (SISO) FSO system. A weak turbulence was generated within the atmospheric chamber and link performances are measured using ß-factor and bit error rate (BER) for On-Off Keying (OOK) modulation scheme. The results demonstrated that the simplest form of SIMO can improve the performance of the FSO communication channel under weak turbulent condition.	bit error rate;channel (communications);data rate units;delta modulation;experiment;megabit;on-off keying;performance;simulation interoperability standards organization;soft-in soft-out decoder;turbulence;x.690	Muhammad Ijaz;Georgina Harris;Bamidele Adebisi;Wasiu O.

In particular, we examine the zero-battery case, i.e, energy harvesting transmitters with no energy storage such as passive RFID tags, in which energy must be spent as it arrives or is lost. To analyze practical finite- length channel codes, we develop a second-order approximation to the communication rate for such channels with energy information causally known at the transmitter. We present two binary examples for which we explicitly calculate the channel capacity and channel dispersion and interestingly observe that a slight increase in the energy arrival probability can significantly boost the achievable rate, and further that the rate loss due to energy intermittency is more pronounced for channels with lower noise levels.	approximation;channel capacity;code;interrupt latency;radio-frequency identification;transmitter	Ebrahim MolavianJazi;Aylin Yener	2014	2015 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7417604	transmitter;dispersion;telecommunications;probability of error;energy harvesting;channel capacity;statistics	Mobile	32.98724786247307	77.8685039188452	24586

The specified limits concerning the maximum value for this distortion that has to be accepted requires its compensation at basestation receivers for a reliable data detection. Another need exists in the field of communication testers for mobile devices. To assess the quality of a transmit signal, an IQ~offset compensation is mandatory. Moreover, it is required for a reliable computation of the corresponding quality measure especially for highly corrupted output signals of mobile devices. Due to deviations of the LTE transmission scheme from classical OFDM, the IQ~offset has to be estimated jointly with the IQ~imbalance and the channel. For the general case, a pilot-aided approach leads to an underdetermined estimation problem. In this context, a solution is presented which approximately solves the problem according to the Maximum-Likelihood criterion. Simulation results show that the introduced approximation is valid and significantly improves the receiver performance.	approximation algorithm;compaq lte;computation;computational complexity theory;distortion;mobile device;simulation;transmitter	Christian Kuhn	2011	2011 IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Fall)	10.1109/VETECF.2011.6092857	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;maximum likelihood;statistics	Mobile	52.1843365060952	82.38847343334832	24587
bf908cea44ba2c6451b6b54914e2507e0025ccda	resource allocation approach for differential doppler reduction in nb-iot over leo satellite		Internet of things (IoT) over satellite is an attractive system architecture which has been proposed as a key-enabling technology, to extend the coverage in remote areas (e.g., desert, ocean, forest, etc), particularly where a terrestrial network is impossible or impractical to reach. One of the most promising technologies that fit the IoT vision of low-power, wide area networks (LPWAN) is the narrowband IoT (NB-IoT). While low earth orbit (LEO) satellites are favourable because of their lower round trip time (RTT) and lower propagation loss in the communication link, they come up with a significantly increased Doppler shift. In our NB-IoT over LEO satellite architecture, we identify the problem of high differential Doppler among channels of different users on Earth, which leads to the performance degradation of our system. In this paper, we propose a resource allocation approach in order to reduce the high values of differential Doppler under the maximum value supported by the standard itself.	doppler effect;elegant degradation;internet of things;low-power broadcasting;naive bayes classifier;software propagation;systems architecture;terrestrial television;toshiba satellite	Oltjon Kodheli;Stefano Andrenacci;Nicola Maturo;Symeon Chatzinotas;Frank Zimmer	2018	2018 9th Advanced Satellite Multimedia Systems Conference and the 15th Signal Processing for Space Communications Workshop (ASMS/SPSC)	10.1109/ASMS-SPSC.2018.8510724	lpwan;architecture;computer network;round-trip delay time;systems architecture;satellite;narrowband iot;resource allocation;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;computer science	AI	26.091172601236206	81.80574955109888	24824

The receiver with the better signal-to-noise ratio decodes all of the information carried by the codeword, while the other receiver decodes only some of the information. The concept of group codes for the Gaussian broadcast channel is developed and applied to permutation codes for the Gaussian broadcast channel. A group code for the Gaussian broadcast channel is a group code for the single-user Gaussian channel in which a subgroup of the generating matrix group is used to partition the codewords into disjoint subsets called clouds. Distinct clouds represent distinct messages for the noisier channel while the individual codewords represent distinct messages for the other channel. The clouds share some of the distance properties of group codes. Necessary and sufficient conditions are given for finding good group codes for the Gaussian broadcast channel (in terms of minimum distance).	code	Charles P. Downey;John K. Karlof	1980	IEEE Trans.

Measurements were carried out at 5.8 GHz. Two-ray model fits measured large scale path loss reasonably well. When the distance is very large, the received signal was found to attenuate at the rate of more than double of that of the free space. The attenuation rate was found to depend on the antenna's height.	fits;interoperability;last mile;list of sequence alignment software;microwave;wireless access point	Joe Jurianto;S. K. Hazra;S. H.

Therefore, this paper, through analytical and simulation efforts, investigates asymmetric relay deployment where the links of cooperating nodes to destination experience unequal signal strength. An analysis of the cooperative error rate at the destination node in such networks is presented. Using the derived expressions for the cooperative error, in conjunction with the approaches used in earlier works, the end-to-end (E2E) performance of a two- hop network can be obtained. Moreover, the derived expression represents, in certain scenarios, a tight bound for the E2E error rate of the two-hop network such as when relay adopts threshold decode-and-forward strategy and/or multi-antenna processing to improve the reliability of its detection.	audio power amplifier;channel (communications);end-to-end principle;interference (communication);relay;simulation;software deployment;system deployment;transmitter	Abdulkareem Adinoyi;Halim Yanikomeroglu	2006	IEEE Globecom 2006	10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.855	signal strength;telecommunications;word error rate;computer science;relay channel;statistics;computer network	Mobile	35.33333844093288	78.09570815111985	24942

Specifically, an improved version of the suboptimal selection with jamming scheme (SSJ) is proposed. To achieve a secure transmission system, we propose the choice of best relay node that will forward the confidential message only when the link quality of the selected relay terminal meets some predefined thresholds and the signal is transmitted with low power. The simulation results show that our proposed scheme can significantly improve the system performance in term of average secrecy throughput and intercept probability.	confidentiality;duplex (telecommunications);hop;information source;radio jamming;relay;secure transmission;simulation;throughput;transmitter;visual intercept	Lukman A.

The advantage of the equal gain precoder based on the scalar quantization (SQ) is that it is easier to encode the feedback information and no need to construct codebook in advance. In the sort of precoder, the bit allocation methods will dominate the system performance. In this paper, we explore an efficient bit allocation algorithm for the scalar quantized equal gain precoder. The proposed bit allocation scheme can improve the performance of the straightforward scalar quantized equal gain precoder. Compared to the optimal bit allocation scheme with exhaustive search, the proposed algorithm greatly reduces the computational complexity while the performance is near to the optimal scheme.	algorithm;brute-force search;codebook;computational complexity theory;encode;mimo;quantization (signal processing);sound quality	Chi-Liang Chao;Shang-Ho Tsai;Terng-Yin Hsu	2010	2010 IEEE 71st Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2010.5493706	transmitter;electronic engineering;quantization;gain;computer science;theoretical computer science;brute-force search;control theory;feedback;mathematics;computer performance;computational complexity theory;precoding;wireless;statistics;mimo	Robotics	42.199170522712365	85.59026598997103	24995

Based on a physically motivated channel model, we first establish a relationship between channel space-frequency correlations and the channel power angle-delay (AD) spectrum in the massive antenna array regime, which reveals the channel sparsity in massive MIMO-OFDM. With this channel model, we then investigate channel estimation (CE) for massive MIMO-OFDM with APSPs. We show that CE performance in terms of sum mean square error can be minimized if the user terminals' channel power distributions in the AD domain are non-overlapping with proper phase shift scheduling. The Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed APSP approach can provide substantial performance gains in terms of achievable spectral efficiency over the conventional phase shift orthogonal pilot approach in typical high mobility scenarios.	channel (communications);channel state information;frequency divider;mimo;mimo-ofdm;mean squared error;multiplexing;overhead (computing);scheduling (computing);shortest path problem;simulation;sparse matrix;spectral efficiency	Li You;Xiqi Gao;A.

0ed8bafc31b42862d73087b1554f1ffd2296309b	analytical framework of hybrid beamforming in multi-cell millimeter-wave systems		Multi-cell wireless systems usually encounter both intra-cell and inter-cell interference, which can be mitigated via coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission. Previous works on multi-cell analysis in the microwave band generally consider fully digital beamforming, requiring a complete radio-frequency chain behind each antenna. This is practically infeasible for millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems where large amounts of antennas are necessary to provide sufficient gain and to enable transmission/reception of multiple streams to/from a user. This paper provides a general methodology to analytically compute the expected per-cell spectral efficiency of an mmWave multi-cell single-stream system using phase-shifter-based analog beamforming and regularized zero-forcing digital beamforming. Four analog–digital hybrid beamforming techniques for multi-cell multi-stream mmWave communication are proposed, assuming that base stations in different cells can share channel state information to cooperatively transmit signals to their home-cell users. Spectral efficiency of the proposed hybrid beamforming approaches is investigated and compared using two channel models suitable for fifth-generation cellular systems, namely the 3rd Generation Partnership Project model and the NYUSIM model. Numerical results show that the benefits of base station coordination (as compared with the non-CoMP case) are governed by the underlying propagation model, and the aggregate interference levels proportional to the cell radius and number of users per cell. We show that in sparse channels, non-CoMP approaches exceed CoMP (coordinated beamforming) performance.		Shu Sun;Theodore S.

TV white spaces (TVWS) are the unused or underutiliised bands in the UHF and VHF part of the band which according to Federal Communication Commission (FCC) can be exploited if the secondary user (SU) with CR capabilities can adequately accommodate the transmission without introducing the harmful interference to incumbent or Primary Users (PU). TV band offers excellent building penetration and less propagation losses when compared to ISM bands of 2.4GHz and 5GHz. The focus of this article is to study cooperative sensing-throughout trade-off for SU with CR capabilities in TVWS. It is shown that with M cognitive users in cooperation we can get increased throughput with increase in sensing time for a fixed probability of false alarm and target probability of detection.	cognitive radio;ibm systems network architecture;implicit shape model;interference (communication);one-class classification;software propagation;superuser;throughput;ultra high frequency;white spaces (radio)	MirMuhammad Lodro;Steve Greedy;Chris Smartt;David W.

9b067e5959b93d50f2ce75bd705122e3c07a9797	gain optimization for millimeter wave reflectarray antennas based on a phase gradient approach		This paper is concerned with reflectarray antenna design with multiple unit cells in order to enhance the gain at the design frequency, while keeping an acceptable bandwidth to work for 5-G mobile base station applications. The design is based on five unit cells. The design begins with an investigation of the phase responses of all unit cells. It is required to choose a unit cell that can span 360° with linear characteristics. Unfortunately, none of the unit cells has perfectly linear phase characteristics. Each of them has a limited linear phase region. The proposed reflectarray design method selects the most linear region from each phase curve for selecting the appropriate unit cell with the appropriate size for each required phase using a phase gradient approach. With this approach, piece-wise linear phase characteristics are adopted for the design of the reflectarray to enhance the gain at the design frequency.	gradient;mathematical optimization	Rania R.

In particular, a novel noncoherent UWB-PNC detector is investigated for the TR UWB networks. Inheriting the simplicity of the TR-UWB receiver, the proposed PNC detector is based on the autocorrelation receiver (AcR) with simple structure, which effectively suppresses the multi-user interference and harvests the multipath energy. Equipped with the proposed TR UWB-PNC detector, the relay node first detects the bitwise XORed symbol directly from the overlapped information bearing waveforms transmitted from the source nodes, then broadcasts the estimate of the XORed symbol to achieve efficient two-way relay. Simulation results show that, compared with the non-relay, one-way relay and two-way relay with time division multiple access (TDMA) and network coded broadcasting (NCBC), the proposed PNC aided two-way scheme significantly improves both the energy and spectral efficiencies of the TR-UWB networks.	autocorrelation;bitwise operation;exclusive or;interference (communication);linear network coding;multi-user;multipath propagation;national centers for biomedical computing;one-way function;relay;simulation;spectral efficiency;transistor;ultra-wideband	Hui Gao;Xin Su;Tiejun Lv;Taotao Wang;Zicheng Wang	2011	2011 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference - GLOBECOM 2011	10.1109/GLOCOM.2011.6133672	synchronization;detector;linear network coding;telecommunications;computer science;interference;radio receiver;relay channel;time division multiple access;spectral efficiency;computer network	Vision	34.30775153277305	77.1917167055561	25180

To avoid “pops and clicks” in the decoded audio signals due to erasure or undetected errors from transmission over unreliable channels, e.g., in the context of digital audio broadcasting (DAB), channel error detection combined with source error concealment, or source error mitigation, techniques are preferred to pure channel error correction. One simple and efficient way to perform channel error detection is to employ a high-rate block code; for example, the preferred solution for hybrid in-band on-channel (HIBOC) DAB in the FM band employs a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) code. Several joint source-channel coding issues arise in this framework because PAC contains a fixed-to-variable source coding component in the form of Huffman codes, so that the output audio packets are of varying length. We explore two such issues in this paper. First, we develop methods for screening for undetected channel errors in the audio decoder by looking for inconsistencies between the number of bits decoded by the Huffman decoder and the number of bits in the packet as specified by control information within the bitstream. We evaluate this scheme by means of simulations of Bernouli sources and real audio data encoded by PAC, both exposed to random bit errors as well as errors that pass undetected through a CRC decoder. Considerable reduction in undetected errors is obtained with little extra processing in the receiver and with little or no increase in the transmitted bit rate. Second, we consider several configurations for the channel error detection codes, in particular CRC codes, by means of representative simulations and informal listening tests, for several audio coder bit rates of interest in DAB. One configuration employs a fixed-rate, fixed-blocklength code of optimized length outside the PAC algorithm. Another preferable set of formats employs variable-blocklength, variable-rate outer codes matched to the individual audio packets, with one or more codewords used per audio packet. In this case, better performance is obtained; however, to maintain a constant bit rate into the channel, PAC and CRC encoding must be performed jointly, e.g., by incorporating the CRC into the bit allocation loop in the audio coder.

In this paper, we generalize this approach to the case of more than two sources. Our proposed relay scheme consists of a scalar LLR quantizer for each source followed by a network coding (NC) step that suitably combines the quantizer outputs. We use the information bottleneck method to design the quantizers and the NC function. At the destination, an iterative message-passing decoder is used to jointly decode all source messages. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed transmission strategy and its suitability for asymmetric source-relay channel conditions.	channel capacity;forward error correction;information bottleneck method;iterative method;linear network coding;lucas–lehmer–riesel test;message passing;numerical linear algebra;quantization (signal processing);relay channel;simulation	Andreas Winkelbauer;Gerald Matz	2012	2012 5th International Symposium on Communications, Control and Signal Processing	10.1109/ISCCSP.2012.6217859	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;relay channel	Arch	34.66111033369329	75.2844722849762	25217

Practical precoder designs are also provided to minimize the feedback information, while maintaining near optimal performance. Also, unlike conventional schemes which require at least two receive antennas, the proposed hybrid scheme works well with a single receive antenna.

9d7a2f09b2f6b72b81828a9aec69a4d14da38a3f	a method of fiber bragg grating sensing signal de-noise based on compressive sensing		A novel de-noising method based on the compressive sensing reconstruction algorithm is proposed in this paper, which is used to solve the problem that the fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensing signal is easily affected by environment interference. By analyzing the characteristics of the FBG signal in the sparse domain, we calculated the sparsity of the FBG signal through the exponential fitting method. Considering the complexity of the traditional algorithm, we proposed a reasonable threshold for selecting multi-atom to reduce the run time of the reconstruction algorithm. In addition, we designed the elimination strategy and double termination conditions to improve the precision of the reconstructed signal. The experiment results show that the maximum reconstructed signal-to-noise ratio of our method is 49.2 dB, with a relative error of 0.0034~0.0074. The run time of the proposed algorithm is much lower than the same-type algorithms. The reconstruction precision is far beyond the wavelet threshold de-noising and empirical mode decomposition.	algorithm;approximation error;compressed sensing;decibel;exponential time hypothesis;hilbert–huang transform;interference (communication);optical fiber;run time (program lifecycle phase);signal-to-noise ratio;sparse matrix;time complexity;wavelet	Yong Chen;Zhiqiang Liu;Huanlin Liu	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2819647	fiber bragg grating;compressed sensing;wavelet;hilbert–huang transform;reconstruction algorithm;noise reduction;electronic engineering;distributed computing;computer science;approximation error;interference (wave propagation)	Mobile	51.26254097990186	84.16835535648411	25273
5015fc42dd644537699a6b4b8c60b88d45ae0a3e	wireless network simplification: the performance of routing		Consider a wireless Gaussian network where a source wishes to communicate with a destination with the help of N full-duplex relay nodes. Most practical systems today route information from the source to the destination using the best path that connects them. In this paper, we show that routing can in the worst case result in an unbounded gap from the network capacity or reversely, physical layer cooperation can offer unbounded gains over routing. More specifically, we show that for N -relay Gaussian networks with an arbitrary topology, routing can in the worst case guarantee an approximate fraction 1 bN/2c+1 of the capacity of the full network, independently of the SNR regime. We prove that this guarantee is fundamental, i.e., it is the highest worst-case guarantee that we can provide for routing in relay networks. Next, we consider how these guarantees are refined for Gaussian layered relay networks with L layers and NL relays per layer. We prove that for arbitrary L and NL, there always exists a route in the network that approximately achieves at least 2 (L−1)NL+4 ( resp. 2 LNL+2 ) of the network capacity for odd L (resp. even L), and there exist networks where the best routes exactly achieve these fractions. These results are formulated within the network simplification framework, that asks what fraction of the capacity we can achieve by using a subnetwork (in our case, a single path). A fundamental step in our proof is a simplification result for MIMO antenna selection that may also be of independent interest. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result that characterizes, for general wireless network topologies, what is the performance of routing with respect to physical layer cooperation techniques that approximately achieve the network capacity.

In such networks, the sensing data from the remote sensors are collected by sinks with the help of access points, and the external eavesdroppers intercept the data transmissions. We focus on the secure transmission in two scenarios: 1) the active sensors transmit their sensing data to the access points and 2) the active access points forward the data to the sinks. We derive new compact expressions for the average secrecy rate in these two scenarios. We also derive a new compact expression for the overall average secrecy rate. Numerical results corroborate our analysis and show that multiple antennas at the access points can enhance the security of three-tier WSNs. Our results show that increasing the number of access points decreases the average secrecy rate between the access point and its associated sink. However, we find that increasing the number of access points first increases the overall average secrecy rate, with a critical value beyond which the overall average secrecy rate then decreases. When increasing the number of active sensors, both the average secrecy rate between the sensor and its associated access point, and the overall average secrecy rate decrease. In contrast, increasing the number of sinks improves both the average secrecy rate between the access point and its associated sink, and the overall average secrecy rate.	cobham's thesis;multitier architecture;secure transmission;sensor;visual intercept;wireless access point	Yansha Deng;Lifeng Wang;Maged Elkashlan;Arumugam Nallanathan;Ranjan K.

The interference between macro and femto cells can be mitigated via cooperation between the macro base station (BS) and the inside femto sites (FSs). In this paper, the idea of multi-cell multi-input and multi-output is introduced, whereby the macro BS shares the same frequency band with the inside FSs in support of the femto users. Both single-user and multi-user precoding at the macro BS are proposed to support the cooperative transmission between the macro BSs and FSs. In single-user precoding and multi-user precoding without power allocation, only the angle information of the FS-user channels is required to be sent from the users to the macro BS. If the magnitude information is also sent by each user, multi-user precoding with power allocation can be employed to support cooperation between macro BSs and FSs, which is an extension of the classical water-filling optimization problem. Theoretical derivations and an iterative algorithm are both presented to solve this optimization problem. Analytical and simulation results with respect to the signal received with interferences validate the effectiveness of cooperation between the macros BSs and FSs.

In the source coding setting, a decoder wishes to reconstruct the source subject to a distortion constraint, while an encoder is required to estimate the decoder's reconstruction reliably. Side information is action-dependent in the sense that its quality and/or availability at the encoder or decoder can be influenced by a cost-constrained action sequence. In the channel coding dual, the decoder wishes to decode both the message and the channel input sequence reliably, and the channel state information available at the encoder or decoder is assumed to depend on the action sequence. We consider discrete memoryless systems and characterize single letter expressions for the rate-distortion-cost function and channel capacity for the respective source and channel coding problems.	channel capacity;channel state information;computer programming;data compression;distortion;encoder;loss function;regular expression;requirement;signal reconstruction	Kittipong Kittichokechai;Tobias J.

In particular, the distortion performance for the transmission of a Gaussian source and compound Poisson energy arrivals is considered. Based on the convexity of the distortion function and Jensen's inequality, a lower bound on the average distortion is established in terms of the capacity of the battery and parameters such as the distribution of energy arrivals and the variance of the source. Moreover, a calculus of variations technique is used to derive an adaptive transmission power policy as well as an adaptive mismatch factor. More specifically, the structure of a locally optimal achievable power policy is characterized as the solution to a first order non-linear ordinary differential equation (ODE). Also for the mismatch factor, a closed-form formula as a function of the battery charge via the LambertW function is derived.	calculus of variations;distortion;exponential hierarchy;jensen's inequality;local optimum;lossy compression;nonlinear system;social inequality	Meysam Shahrbaf Motlagh;Masoud Badiei Khuzani;Patrick Mitran	2014	2014 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2014.6875019	mathematical optimization;telecommunications;mathematics	Arch	36.81015611822715	69.63066343064006	25488

A substantial number of new formulas, exact and approximate, closed form, and integral form, are presented. In particular, a tight close-form approximation for the phase probability density function is found that yields results almost indistinguishable from the exact integral formulation. Most strikingly, the approximate formulation comprises the exact Nakagami-m phase as well as the exact Von Mises (Tikhonov) densities. Joint statistics involving combinations of the envelope, phase, and their time derivatives are derived in an exact manner. The exact phase crossing rate is then obtained in an integral form. A closed-form approximation is proposed that yields very good results as compared to the exact formulation. A Monte Carlo simulation plot is used to validate the formula of the exact phase crossing rate. The formulations presented here drastically facilitate the use of the phase statistics of the κ-μ fading model.	approximation algorithm;cobham's thesis;emoticon;first-order predicate;monte carlo method;portable document format;simulation;software propagation;usability	Iury Bertollo Gomes Porto;Michel Daoud Yacoub	2016	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2016.2544924	frequency modulation;mathematical optimization;probability density function;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;calculus;mathematics;wireless;statistics	EDA	38.87237922884333	76.91969086035257	25495

For a MAP receiver to suppress the CCI, conventionally, this can be done in two ways: 1) spatio-temporal filtering (STF) the received signals prior to the fast Fourier transform (FFT), which we refer to it as preFFT-STF; 2) spatial filtering (SF) the received signals posterior to FFT, which is referred to as postFFT-SF. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms significantly both the preFFT-STF and postFFT-SF systems.	approximation algorithm;bit error rate;estimation theory;fast fourier transform;interference (communication);iterative method;mimo;mimo-ofdm;modulation;multiplexing;recursive least squares filter;simulation;smoothing;statistical interference;x.690	Lisheng Fan;Yangyang Zhang;Yongquan Jiang;Kai-Kit Wong	2009	GLOBECOM 2009 - 2009 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425538	fast fourier transform;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics;statistics	Vision	49.350400415384314	77.86847764954007	25539

Channel knowledge is obtained by a linear estimator whose initial decisions are iteratively refined by using a soft feedback from the single-user decoders. In addition to the traditional training symbol based signaling scheme, we study a novel method that utilizes a random bias in the symbol probabilities of the transmitted signal to construct the initial channel estimates. The numerical results suggest that in the large system limit, appropriate selection of the channel code and signaling method allows for successful communication with vanishing training overhead in overloaded systems if iterative channel and data estimation is performed at the receiver.	channel capacity;iterative method;multi-user;multipath propagation;numerical analysis;overhead (computing);randomness	Mikko Vehkaperä;Keigo Takeuchi;Ralf R.

They are crucial for meeting the requirements of wireless traffic explosion emerging with new wireless applications and services. However, the security of CRNs is critical for their practical usage and widespread proliferation. Therefore, the fundamental mechanism of spectrum sensing in these systems has to be investigated from the security perspective. In this work, we define and analyze coordinated attack models for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing (CSS) in CRNs. We devise a simple yet effective countermeasure scheme based on trust management for cooperative sensing. We also provide experimental results to illustrate the performance of these systems under coordinated attacks.	cascading style sheets;cognitive radio;countermeasure (computer);frequency allocation;requirement;simulation;trust management (information system);two generals' problem	Levent Altay;Gürkan Gür;Fatih Alagöz	2014	2014 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2014.6952635	cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	30.953587034533864	87.39726773137667	25594

And at the same time, we can still find some codes which have very good performance. We present some new codes of high complexity at the end of this paper and show that our codes have better performance than many codes before.	convolutional code;trellis quantization	Guixia Kang;Elena Costa;Binghua Qi;Xianglan Jin;Ping Zhang	2002		10.1109/WCNC.2002.993473	block code;concatenated error correction code;turbo code;discrete mathematics;convolutional code;hamming distance;online codes;trellis modulation;channel code;fountain code;performance;telecommunications;space–time trellis code;computer science;theoretical computer science;frequency;serial concatenated convolutional codes;bcjr algorithm;tornado code;linear code;luby transform code;mathematics;error floor;fading;statistics	Theory	42.98049088793024	69.81777229344885	25627

The work has been developed by assuming that the host features are independent and identically distributed Gaussian random variables, and that a minimum distance criterion is used to decode the embedded information. The theoretical bit error probabilities are derived in closed form, thus permitting to evaluate the impact of the considered attacks on the watermark at a theoretical level. The analysis is validated by means of extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Moreover, Monte Carlo simulations permitted to abandon the hypothesis of normally distributed host features, in favor of more realistic models based on a Laplacian or a Generalized Gaussian pdf. The overall result of our analysis is that ST-DM exhibits excellent performance in all cases with the only noticeable exception of the gain attack.	additive white gaussian noise;bit error rate;digital watermarking;direct web remoting;embedded system;monte carlo method;portable document format;signal processing;simulation;utility functions on indivisible goods	Mauro Barni;Attilio Borello;Franco Bartolini;Alessandro Piva	2004		10.1117/12.524335	econometrics;theoretical computer science;mathematics;statistics	AI	31.649708937273314	66.79658911973956	25693

In this paper, we investigate the performance achieved by the BP algorithm for decoding one-step majority logic decodable (OSMLD) codes. The BP algorithm is expressed in terms of likelihood ratios rather than probabilities, as conventionally presented. The proposed algorithm fits better the decoding of OSMLD codes with respect to its numerical stability due to the fact that the weights of their check sums are often much higher than that of the corresponding LDPC codes. Although it has been believed that OSMLD codes are far inferior to LDPC codes, we show that for medium code lengths (say between 200-1000 bits), the BP decoding of OSMLD codes can significantly outperform BP decoding of their equivalent LDPC codes. The reasons for this behavior are elaborated.	belief propagation;code;software propagation	Rainer Lucas;Marc P. C. Fossorier;Yu Kou;Shu Lin	2000	IEEE Trans.

Since the pilot sub-carrier correlations are rank deficient, an estimation scheme can be implemented by discarding the noise subspace components and filtering the subspace components. The subspace can be estimated by some subspace tracking (ST) algorithm. We propose to implement the subspace components filtering via a QR factorization based algorithm, which is suitable for operating in conjunction with the ST algorithm. The performance of the proposed schemes is verified by simulation in computer.	algorithm;channel state information;frequency divider;multiplexing;qr decomposition;simulation;subcarrier	Rui F.

In order to overcome the analytical difficulties of the proposed composite channel model, we employed the mixture Gamma (MG) distribution. The proposed model shows a high accurate and tractable approximation just by adjusting some parameters. More specifically, we derived new closed-form expression for average bit error rate employing rectangular quadrature amplitude modulation in term of MG distribution and generalized power series of the Meijer's G- function. The closed-form has been validated numerically and asymptotically at high signal to noise ratio.	approximation;bit error rate;channel (communications);cobham's thesis;end-to-end principle;heterodyne;hop;mg (editor);mixture model;modulation;numerical analysis;profiling (computer programming);signal-to-noise ratio;turbulence	Wael G.

3720736a1b357d8c9a5c3a4e379fc64f2b8cc83e	beamforming only based on specular component for downlink massive mimo systems		In this paper, we are concerned with a multiuser downlink massive MIMO system operating over Ricean fading channels where each user can be equipped with one or multiple antennas. We present a beamforming (BF) transmission scheme that is only based on the specular component, which can reduce efficiently the heavy overhead for channel estimation. For the individual achievable rates, we particularly analyze their power-scaling law when the transmit power per user is scaled down by the number of antennas at the base station (BS). It is found that the individual rates of the proposed BF can be higher than the corresponding rates of the BF based on the scattered and specular components if the specular component is relatively strong. In addition, it is shown that each user can asymptotically achieve the same rate as in the single-user case when both the numbers of BS antennas and the user terminals go to infinity with a fixed ratio. Thus we conclude that the massive MIMO systems may be more suitable to be deployed in Ricean fading rather than Rayleigh fading.	beamforming;brainfuck;channel state information;goto;image scaling;mimo;moore's law;multi-user;overhead (computing);rayleigh fading;telecommunications link	Dian-Wu Yue;Qiuna Yan	2017	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-016-3919-z	computer science;real-time computing;transmitter power output;mimo;telecommunications link;fading;beamforming;rayleigh fading;base station;communication channel	Networks	37.67579035592042	82.35173752848507	25805

TxID signal can also be used to find the co-channel and adjacent interference signals, to assist accurate location finding calculation, and to obtain the channel estimation for each transmitter, which can help local service (e.g., targeted advertisement) reception, as well as for emergency alert. For efficient use of spectrum and quality of service improvement, single frequency network (SFN) where all transmitters share a single RF channel is often implemented. The recently developed ATSC 3.0 physical layer standard has been designed to support SFN. For efficient designing, fine-tuning and operating an SFN, it is crucial to identify each transmitter, as well as to adjust transmitting power and emission time of each transmitter. This paper presents TxID for ATSC 3.0, and analyzes its detection performance under very low signal to noise ratio environments and other applications, such as location finding, and channel estimation etc. for each SFN transmitter.	atsc 3.0;atsc standards;channel state information;interference (communication);phy (chip);quality of service;radio frequency;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;single-frequency network;transmitter	Sung Ik Park;Wei Li;Jae-young Lee;Yiyan Wu;Xianbin Wang;Sunhyoung Kwon;Bo-Mi Lim;Heung Mook Kim;Namho Hur;Liang Zhang;Jeongchang Mook Kim	2017	IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting	10.1109/TBC.2016.2630268	gold;transmitter;electronic engineering;telecommunications;digital watermarking;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;shift register;radio frequency	Mobile	47.42321954025499	84.85796751635479	25880

It performs one-pass coding and transmission in real-time, and uses at most one more bit per letter than does the standard two-pass Huffman algorithm; this is optimum in the worst case among all one-pass schemes. We also analyze the dynamic Huffman algorithm due to Faller, Gallager, and Knuth. In each algorithm, both the sender and the receiver maintain equivalent dynamically varying Huffman trees. The processing time required to encode and decode a letter whose node in the dynamic Huffman tree is currently on the lth level is O(l); hence, the processing can be done in real time. Empirical tests show that Algorithm V performs quite well in practice, often better than the two-pass method. The proposed algorithm is well-suited for file compression and online encoding/decoding in data networks.	adaptive huffman coding;algorithm;best, worst and average case;data compression;encode;real-time transcription	Jeffrey Scott Vitter	1985	26th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (sfcs 1985)	10.1109/SFCS.1985.18	real-time computing;shannon–fano coding;data structure;canonical huffman code;computer science;theoretical computer science;modified huffman coding;mathematics;tunstall coding;algorithm;huffman coding;range encoding	Theory	38.00461424636602	61.324682832302265	25978

2a92c970ad9fc446e1aed32d85c3b8c73f2510e5	a generalized framework on beamformer design and csi acquisition for single-carrier massive mimo systems in millimeter wave channels		In this paper, we establish a general framework on the reduced dimensional channel state information (CSI) estimation and pre-beamformer design for frequency-selective massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems employing single- carrier (SC) modulation in time division duplex (TDD) mode by exploiting the joint angle-delay domain channel sparsity in millimeter (mm) wave frequencies. First, based on a generic subspace projection taking the joint angle-delay power profile and user-grouping into account, the reduced-rank minimum mean square error (RR-MMSE) instantaneous CSI estimator is derived for spatially correlated wideband MIMO channels. Second, the statistical pre-beamformer design is considered for frequency-selective SC massive MIMO channels. We examine the dimension reduction problem and subspace (beamspace) construction on which the RR-MMSE estimation can be realized as accurately as possible. It is observed that the proposed techniques show remarkable robustness to the pilot interference (or contamination) with a significant reduction in pilot overhead.	beamforming;channel state information;dimensionality reduction;duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);mimo;mean squared error;modulation;overhead (computing);rapid refresh;round-robin scheduling;sparse matrix;test-driven development	Gokhan M.

In particular, two encoders, connected by two communication links with finite capacities, wish to send secret messages to the common intended decoder in the presence of a passive eavesdropper. The inner and outer bounds on the secrecy capacity are derived for the discrete memoryless channel. The derived inner bound rate region is achievable by combining Willems's coding for the MAC with partially cooperating encoders and Wyner's random binning for the wiretap channel. Then, both the inner and outer bounds are extended to the Gaussian case and the corresponding rate regions are established. Several simple achievable transmission schemes are proposed for the Gaussian channel and the numerical results show that the partial encoder cooperation can increase the achievable rate regions.	additive white gaussian noise;channel (communications);eddy willems;encoder;numerical analysis;product binning	Peng Xu;Zhiguo Ding;Xuchu Dai	2013	IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security	10.1109/TIFS.2013.2282913	channel code;telecommunications;computer science;statistics;computer network	Mobile	34.623891211684914	70.53044263514074	26048

The receiver experiences excessive CCI under overload which occurs when there are more signals than receive antennas. This makes separation and estimation of the transmitted data signals difficult. We develop a novel reduced-complexity receiver structure for the separation and symbol detection of multiple co-channel signals in frequency-flat Rayleigh fading channels. Moreover, we show that list-based group-wise processing can achieve better performance at low and moderate signal-to-noise ratios than existing group-wise soft information processing schemes. The receiver is equipped with multiple antennas and developed to work under overload. Its structure consists of a linear preprocessor followed by a nonlinear reduced-complexity symbol detector. The proposed list group-search detection (LGSD) algorithm relies on list feedback and reduces complexity by iteratively searching over groups of transmitted symbols. It outputs a list of likely data symbols which is well suited to further processing using soft input error control decoders. Simulation shows that LGSD can achieve near optimum joint maximum likelihood performance under overload at significantly lower complexity.	algorithm;ampersand;analysis of algorithms;data compression;download;error detection and correction;h+: the digital series;information processing;interference (communication);iteration;java modeling language;nonlinear system;operator overloading;preprocessor;rayleigh fading;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;singular value decomposition;the matrix;transmitter;whitening transformation	Michael Krause;Desmond P.

From the results of simulations using error pattern data collected in field tests and the comparison of various error-correction codes under many conditions, it has been determined that the shortened (272, 190) majority-logic decodable difference-set cyclic code is a suitable code for NTSC TV signals. By using error-correction codes proposed to date for teletext, it has been difficult to obtain a page error rate (PER) of 10 -1 in many measurement points. However, PER's of less than 10 -2 can be obtained in this system, even when random noise, ghost interference, or waveform distortion are present and bit error rates (BER's) are 10 -2 . This paper also gives an empirical equation according to the error data and shows that the error-correction capability increased equivalently up to 11 error-bits in a packet by modifying the decoding algorithm.	multiplexing;network packet	Osamu Yamada	1987	IEEE Trans.

We first derive maximum-likelihood (ML) and minimum-mean square error (MMSE) iterative channel estimators. Modeling the time domain signal as Gaussian, we derive an ML channel estimator by averaging the likelihood function for both data and channel impulse response (CIR) over the resulting Gaussian vector. Two data detectors are also proposed by eliminating the CIR from the likelihood function. The resulting integer least squares problem can be efficiently solved using a sphere decoder (SD). Furthermore, the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for the superimposed channel and data estimation is derived. The equispaced pilot placement is optimal in superimposed training. The ideal performance benchmarks are reached by our proposed estimators.

A single value decomposition-based multiuser decomposition technique has been used to mitigate the interference between different users. It has been shown that the nonlinear distortion caused due to transmitter nonlinearity considerably degrades the performance of MU-MIMO-OFDM system and is a function of number of users. Further, this nonlinear distortion also introduces an irreducible error floor thus limiting the gains of MU-MIMO-OFDM system as compared to single user MIMO-OFDM system.	distortion;error floor;frequency divider;interference (communication);irreducibility;mimo-ofdm;multipath propagation;multiplexing;nonlinear system;rayleigh fading;singular value decomposition;telecommunications link;transmitter	Parag Aggarwal;Vivek Ashok Bohara	2017	IEEE Wireless Communications Letters	10.1109/LWC.2017.2699195	mimo;multi-user mimo;precoding;singular value decomposition;nonlinear distortion;mathematics;nonlinear system;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;mimo-ofdm;control theory	Mobile	47.46947491566764	79.99110474557722	26447

Sequences with the maximum possible number of frames have been found up to frame size 15 . Examples are given for every frame length up to 88 , and powers of two up to 1024 .

In order to maximize the feedback utility efficiency, we propose to dynamically allocate feedback bits across multiple remote antenna units (RAUs) according to the instantaneous channel condition for a given total feedback constraint. We first derive an upper bound and a lower bound on the spectral efficiency of the DAS. Then, by maximizing the bounds while satisfying the feedback bits constraint respectively, we derive two adaptive feedback allocation schemes. Furthermore, the impact of imperfect CSI at the mobile user (MU) is analyzed and the corresponding feedback bits allocation scheme is given. Numerical results show that the proposed adaptive schemes have obvious performance gains over the traditional uniform feedback allocation.	beamforming;feedback;preprocessor;simulation;spectral efficiency;transmitter;vector quantization	Xiaoming Chen;Jian Chen;Chau Yuen	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Communication Systems	10.1109/ICCS.2014.7024854	real-time computing;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;resource management;control theory;upper and lower bounds	Robotics	39.057366844021274	84.61424257557151	26605

Schalkwijk and Kailath presented a feedback scheme that dramatically improves the error probability for finite block lengths. Unfortunately, the Schalkwijk-Kailath scheme requires perfect feedback, which is often not feasible. We study the performance of linear transmission schemes for AWGN channels with separate quantization of the feedback signal and the receiver input signal. The quantizers are designed in a rate-information-optimal manner using the Gaussian information bottleneck. We provide expressions for achievable rates and error probabilities in terms of the so-called information-rate function. It turns out the exploiting knowledge of the quantized feedback signal at the receiver is crucial for achieving strictly positive rates.	additive white gaussian noise;feedback;gibibyte;quantization (signal processing);time complexity;transceiver	Stefan Farthofer;Andreas Winkelbauer;Gerald Matz	2014	2014 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW 2014)	10.1109/ITW.2014.6970899	electronic engineering;theoretical computer science;control theory;mathematics	Embedded	37.730499213256955	68.70178243930711	26611

A new capacity lower bound is derived by using a truncated-Gaussian input distribution. Numerical evaluation shows that this capacity lower bound is nearly tight at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), while it is shown analytically that the gap to capacity upper bounds is a small constant at high SNR. In particular, the gap to the high-SNR asymptotic capacity of the channel under either a peak or an average constraint is small. This leads to a simple approximation of the high SNR capacity. Additionally, a new capacity upper bound is derived using sphere-packing arguments. This bound is tight at high SNR for a channel with a dominant peak constraint.	approximation;fibre channel;modulation;numerical analysis;set packing;signal-to-noise ratio;vanish (computer science)	Anas Chaaban;Jean-Marie Morvan;Mohamed-Slim Alouini	2015	2015 4th International Workshop on Optical Wireless Communications (IWOW)	10.1109/IWOW.2015.7342269	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;telecommunications;mathematics;channel capacity	Arch	37.36862650292451	70.07428951174171	26640

ef84e6f47060be0ea10285893c6c1b92973ba757	adaptive error control code implementation framework for software defined wireless sensor network (sdwsn)		We propose an adaptive error control implementation framework for software defined wireless sensor network (SDWSN). This scheme exploits the features provided by both software defined network (SDN) and forward error correction (FEC). The framework supports adaptability at both transmitter and receiver. Additionally, the scheme allows using different FECs in different sections of a network or a link. Therefore, the framework is flexible to support heterogeneous wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The adaptability and flexibility offered by the proposed scheme lead to reduce energy consumptions at energy-constrained nodes in WSN. The scheme also exploits energy-constrained properties of nodes in data-centric storage network. The framework offered to use both iterative and non-iterative codes depending on the demand. The use of iterative codes provides more flexibility and adaptability than non-iterative codes due to features provided by iterative codes.	code;error detection and correction;exploit (computer security);forward error correction;iteration;iterative method;sensor;software-defined networking;storage area network;transmitter	Rajan Kadel;Khandakar Ahmed;Anuj Nepal	2017	2017 27th International Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference (ITNAC)	10.1109/ATNAC.2017.8215413	wireless sensor network;error detection and correction;software-defined networking;real-time computing;adaptability;forward error correction;software;exploit;transmitter;computer science	Mobile	31.15494323447167	74.37944068760275	26681

In this mechanism, The BS uses well known recursive least square (RLS) algorithm as prediction tool which adapts with SNR variations over time and provides predicted SNR with minimized error. We define the error distribution from the error data thus, we derive the probability of error in each adaptive modulation level to define the average spectral efficiency, average bit error rate (BER) and average throughput with predicted FB and actual FB. Numerical examples confirm that the FB prediction mechanism creates minimum degradation of downlink performance.	algorithm;approximation;bit error rate;elegant degradation;feedback;modulation;overhead (computing);recursion;recursive least squares filter;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;throughput;x.690	Mohammad Abdul Awal;Lila Boukhatem	2009	2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449723	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;base station;statistics	Arch	41.804908712265366	82.60022845549823	26698
0a6b0165ac354f60d6c241f65d474ec247e091c1	a joint filtering and precoding based uplink mc-noma		Non Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) has become one of the prospective candidates for upcoming 5th generation Cellular network standard. Multicarrier NOMA (MC-NOMA) is a kind of hybrid NOMA, where, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) may be employed to achieve higher capacity. However, MC-NOMA scheme based on OFDMA face the problem of higher Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR). The high PAPR reduces both energy and spectral efficiency of the MC-NOMA scheme. Therefore, in this paper, a new Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filtering based Zadoff-Chu Matrix Transform (ZCMT) precoded uplink MC-NOMA scheme is presented to reduce higher PAPR. MATLAB® simulations demonstrate that, the proposed filter based ZCMT precoded uplink MC-NOMA scheme outperform the ZCMT precoded uplink MC-NOMA schemes without filtering, uplink Single Carrier NOMA (SC-NOMA) schemes and conventional uplink MC-NOMA schemes available in the literature.	finite impulse response;matlab;power architecture platform reference;prospective search;simulation;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;transformation matrix	Imran Baig;Umer Farooq;Najam Ul Hasan;Manaf Zghaibeh;U.

eeaff03a43d77c3a160072e08b7dc0461a6874b5	adaptive aperture aided antenna design for siso-mimo systems using fuzzy c-mean clustering	rayleigh flat fading;co channel interference;bit error rate;effective aperture;rayleigh frequency selective fading;radiation pattern;directivity;communication	One of the most relevant themes of wireless communication is to achieve better spectral efficiency and provide high reliability while providing rich-content data services despite the existence of several serious challenges. A few of them are multipath fading, multi-user interference, co-channel interference CCI, inter symbol interference ISI etc to name a few. Several techniques have already been developed and deployed to eliminate the fading effects. One of the less explored techniques which have been adopted and discussed in this chapter is based on the structure of the transmitting antenna. The physical dimension of the antenna is varied as per the fading condition by adopting a dynamic process which adjusts the structure to provide the best quality of service QoS. Two types of antenna set-ups are considered-Single Input-Single Output SISO and Multiple Input-Multiple Output MIMO. The transmitting antenna in this system adaptively updates its aperture to improve the system performance and at the same time optimizes the driving power of the antenna as per requirement. The system changes the effective aperture of the transmitting antenna in high data rate, time varying Rayleigh channels to adapt to a previously set Bit error Rate BER. However, in a real time environment the BER keeps on changing based on the channel condition. It is difficult to attain a fixed value of BER and hence even more difficult to model the antenna structure for a single time instant. As a result there exist a number of effective aperture dimensions for various BER in a single time instant. Out of the various values, two specific limits of the effective aperture of the transmitting antenna needs to be decided. Fuzzy C-Mean FCM Clustering method being one of the most popular and efficient clustering technique is used to set two limits of the aperture within which a particular threshold of the BER is obtained at one particular instant of time. The results derived show the effectiveness of the entire system.	mimo;soft-in soft-out decoder	Parismita A.

d6ca3f1a73bf874043742e0e03d548283790d699	approaching miscorrection-free performance of product codes with anchor decoding		Product codes (PCs) protect a 2-D array of bits using short component codes. Assuming transmission over the binary symmetric channel, the decoding is commonly performed by iteratively applying bounded-distance decoding to the component codes. For this coding scheme, undetected errors in the component decoding—also known as miscorrections—significantly degrade the performance. In this paper, we propose a novel iterative decoding algorithm for PCs which can detect and avoid most miscorrections. The algorithm can also be used to decode many recently proposed classes of generalized PCs, such as staircase, braided, and half-product codes. Depending on the component code parameters, our algorithm significantly outperforms the conventional iterative decoding method. As an example, for double-error-correcting Bose–Chaudhuri–Hocquenghem component codes, the net coding gain can be increased by up to 0.4 dB. Moreover, the error floor can be lowered by orders of magnitude, up to the point where the decoder performs virtually identical to a genie-aided decoder that avoids all miscorrections. We also discuss post-processing techniques that can be used to reduce the error floor even further.	approximation algorithm;bch code;binary symmetric channel;code (cryptography);code word;coding gain;error detection and correction;error floor;genie;iteration;iterative method;multidimensional digital pre-distortion;network of cancer genes;qr code;recursion;the matrix;vector graphics;video post-processing;x.690;xfig	Christian H&#x00E4;ger;Henry D.

In this paper, this prior knowledge is employed to develop a new equalizer based on minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. In particular, the proposed equalizer can achieve 3 dB gains comparing to the traditional MMSE equalizer in large signal-to-noise (SNR) region. Furthermore, the successive detection (SD) technique is used in the proposed equalizer is able to take the advantage of time diversity in time-varying channels. The computational complexity of the proposed methods are also analyzed and shown to be more efficient. Computer simulations are included to compare the proposed approaches with the traditional techniques in terms of detection performance.	computational complexity theory;decibel;detection theory;elegant degradation;equalization (communications);large-signal model;mimo-ofdm;mean squared error;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Min Huang;Lei Huang;Weize Sun;Qiang Li;Peichang Zhang	2015	2015 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA)	10.1109/APSIPA.2015.7415460	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;adaptive equalizer;computer science	EDA	47.526926733264624	77.33264132055044	26794

For determined network, Jaggi–Sanders algorithm is generalized to its nonlinear form for the the multicast network. Precise details of the algorithm implementation and the proof on the algorithm existence are given. The error-correcting codes for determined network coding is also proposed based on the traditional error-correcting codes for network coding. For random network, the nonlinear network coding scheme is proposed. It shows the nonlinear network coding has advantages in solving the so-called “all-or-nothing” problem caused by errors. Some interesting mathematical concepts such as shared agreements, composite functions and n-dimensional maximal independent set based on combinatorics are proposed. These new concepts may offer beneficial lessons for further research on nonlinear network coding.	linear network coding	Guangzhi Zhang;Shaobin Cai;Dongqiu Zhang	2018	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-017-5109-z	theoretical computer science;multicast;computer science;linear network coding;real-time computing;nonlinear system;random graph;maximal independent set;composite number	Mobile	31.639381566120775	71.55285135282571	26799

The analysis is applied to evaluate the BEP in antenna diversity reception and in a cellular CDMA system. Diversity and multiuser receivers are compared based on the examples. It is observed that adding new diversity antenna elements improves performance even if the correlation between the antenna elements is relatively large (up to 0.7). However, the large correlation values pose a significant reduction in the diversity gain in comparison to the zero correlation. It is also seen that the macroscopic diversity improves the performance of receivers significantly in cellular CDMA networks. When comparing diversity and multiuser receivers it is concluded that multiuser receivers are necessary to provide low BEPs. It is also highly beneficial to have at least two diversity antennas available, in particular, if there is no multipath diversity provided by the channel. The results also show that the reduction of intercell multiple-access interference yields a significant performance advantage in cellular networks. It is also demonstrated that the combination of spatial diversity and a multiuser receiver provides a significant receiver performance or system capacity gain in comparison to implementing only one of them.	bit error rate;channel capacity;interference (communication);multi-user;multipath propagation;profiling (computer programming);rayleigh fading;sensor	Markku J.

In order to provide unique decodability property to the receiver and to maximally enlarge the constellation constrained (CC) capacity region, a relative angle of rotation is introduced between the signal sets. Subsequently, the structure of the sum alphabet of two PSK signal sets is exploited to prove that Ungerboeck labelling on the trellis of each user maximizes the guaranteed minimum squared Euclidean distance, d 2 g,min in the sum trellis. Hence, such a labelling scheme can be used systematically to construct trellis code pairs for a two-user GMAC to approach any rate pair within the capacity region.	convolutional code;euclidean distance;maxima and minima;modulation;pre-shared key;trellis quantization	Jagadeesh Harshan;B.

A novel framework for dynamic joint adaptation of modulation order, number of code channels (hence transmission rate), and transmission power is proposed for downlink data transmission in a cellular WCDMA system where different users have similar frame error rate (FER) requirements. Based on a general downlink signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) model, the problem of optimal dynamic rate and power adaptation is formulated, for which the rate and power allocation can be found by an exhaustive search. Two heuristic-based dynamic rate and power allocation schemes are proposed. Performance of dynamic joint rate and power adaptation under the proposed framework is evaluated for a random micromobility model using computer simulations. Also, an analytical approach to evaluate the throughput performance of dynamic rate and power adaptation using high-order modulation and multicode formats is presented.	bit error rate;brute-force search;computer simulation;error detection and correction;forward error correction;heuristic;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;modulation;multi-user;performance;requirement;telecommunications link;throughput	Dong In Kim;Ekram Hossain;Vijay K.

The geometric mean decomposition (GMD) is a signal processing technique which can be used to process transmit and receive signals in MIMO channels. The GMD pre- and post-procesing in conjunction with dirty-paper precoding shows some advantages over the popular singular value decomposition (SVD) technique which provides GMD-assisted MIMO systems a superior performance particularly when the channel is affected by antennas correlation.

Iterative soft demodulation and decoding using the Turbo principle can be applied to such a system to increase the system capacity and performance. To combat multiple access interference (MAI), we incorporate the interference cancellation (IC) and decision-directed channel estimation (CE) in the demodulator. However, both IC and CE are subject to performance degradation due to incorrect decisions. In order to prevent error propagation from the decision feedback, soft interference cancellation and channel estimation assisted demodulation is proposed in this paper. The performance of this strategy is evaluated numerically and proved to be superior to the hard decision-directed approach with a minor increase in complexity. key words: code division multiple access, multipath channel estimation, interference cancellation, iterative soft demodulation.	channel capacity;channel state information;elegant degradation;gps signals;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);iteration;modulation;multi-user;multipath propagation;numerical analysis;propagation of uncertainty;rayleigh fading;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;software propagation;turbo code	Pei Xiao;Erik G.

This paper presents the extensive propagation measurements conducted in two typical types of subway tunnels - traditional arched “Type I” tunnel and modern arched “Type II” tunnel - with 300- and 500-m radii of curvature with different configurations - horizontal and vertical polarizations at 920, 2400, and 5705 MHz, respectively. Based on the measurements, statistical metrics of propagation loss and shadow fading (path-loss exponent, shadow fading distribution, autocorrelation, and crosscorrelation) in all the measurement cases are extracted. Then, the large-scale fading characteristics in the curved subway tunnels are compared with the cases of road and railway tunnels, the other main rail traffic scenarios, and some “typical” scenarios to give a comprehensive insight into the propagation in various scenarios where the intelligent transportation systems are deployed. Moreover, for each of the large-scale fading parameters, extensive analysis and discussions are made to reflect the physical laws behind the observations. The quantitative results and findings are useful to realize intelligent transportation systems in the subway system.	autocorrelation;cross-correlation;polarization (waves);reliability (computer networking);software propagation	Ke Guan;Bo Ai;Zhangdui Zhong;Carlos F.

There are three cases of multi-path: the general diffuse difference between the mobile satellite communication and the fixed satellite communication is that the earth station is in motion when it works in mobile satellite communication. In addition, there are multi-path fading, Doppler shift, shadowing effect and rain attenuation in land mobile satellite communication. In this paper, the usability of the communication system is emphasized and appropriate measure based on four major characters in the K u band land mobile satellite communication system i s taken, and the system usability is then calculated, finally the calculation result is analyzed.	communications satellite;doppler effect;fixed-satellite service;ibm system i;ku band;msat;radio wave;rain fade;usability	Baohui Zhang;Hongke Zhang;Jinrong Sun	2003		10.1109/PIMRC.2003.1264362	doppler effect;telecommunications;computer science;fading;communications satellite;communications system;direct-broadcast satellite television	Mobile	25.735877149648285	79.17747610080308	27117
86b94c8c1ffff5c38b5e17b036d9a4ef92ad04be	bdma for millimeter-wave/terahertz massive mimo transmission with per-beam synchronization		We propose beam division multiple access (BDMA) with per-beam synchronization (PBS) in time and frequency for wideband massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission over millimeter-wave (mmW)/Terahertz (THz) bands. We first introduce a physically motivated beam domain channel model for massive MIMO and demonstrate that the envelopes of the beam domain channel elements tend to be independent of time and frequency when both the numbers of antennas at base station and user terminals (UTs) tend to infinity. Motivated by the derived beam domain channel properties, we then propose PBS for mmW/THz massive MIMO. We show that both the effective delay and Doppler frequency spreads of wideband massive MIMO channels with PBS are reduced by a factor of the number of UT antennas compared with the conventional synchronization approaches. Subsequently, we apply PBS to BDMA, investigate beam scheduling to maximize the ergodic achievable rates for both uplink and downlink BDMA, and develop a greedy beam scheduling algorithm. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of BDMA with PBS for mmW/THz wideband massive MIMO systems in typical mobility scenarios.	channel (communications);doppler effect;ergodicity;euler–bernoulli beam theory;greedy algorithm;mimo;mimo-ofdm;overhead (computing);scheduling (computing);simulation;telecommunications link	Li You;Xiqi Gao;Geoffrey Ye Li;Xiang-Gen Xia;Ni Ma	2017	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2017.2699100	computer network;mimo;extremely high frequency;computer science;telecommunications link;3g mimo;multi-user mimo;wideband;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;mimo-ofdm	Networks	29.974970497880214	84.3019301352078	27134

Generally, common data rate of a conventional multicast system is determined by a minimum link capacity between a base station and multiple users. However, common data rate of the multicast system based on relay station is determined by not only a link capacity between the base station and relay station but also a minimum link capacity between the relay station and multiple users. Considering these characteristics, we derive the number of users and a range of received signal power of relay station to show that the relay station based multicast system guarantees more quality of service than conventional multicast system.	broadcast relay station;data rate units;global variable;multi-user;multicast;quality of service;reed–solomon error correction;simulation	Seonghyun Kim	2012	IEEE international Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting	10.1109/BMSB.2012.6264273	electronic engineering;local management interface;multicast;telecommunications;engineering;relay channel;source-specific multicast;xcast;computer network	Metrics	33.76280756084403	88.4908373501456	27137

The importance of training and appropriate initialization in combination with the Kalman tracking algorithm is shown. Adopting a periodical training scheme with a given bandwidth efficiency, a trade-off between investing pilots for good initialization and training the algorithm exclusively leads to the lowest BER. We also introduce a training on request scheme, in order to overcome the error propagation encountered by the Kalman filter after a series of detection errors. For this purpose, two metrics to detect the Kalman filter divergence are developed. We show the effectiveness of the new aperiodical training scheme in reducing the channel estimation error and saving bandwidth at the same time.	algorithm;channel state information;kalman filter;mimo;propagation of uncertainty;sensor;software propagation;spectral efficiency;x.690	Emna Eitel;Joachim Speidel	2011			control engineering;electronic engineering;control theory;extended kalman filter;moving horizon estimation;mimo	Vision	50.76630463143509	77.44159400411019	27208

In order to improve channel estimation we propose a blind data-aided method based on complex independent component analysis (cICA) with the aid of mutual information rate as contrast function. In this approach, interference and the noise are first suppressed by subspace projection, then the uplink data is extracted blindly. Finally, based on the estimated uplink data of all the users in the cell of interest, the least square estimate of the channel is obtained. Simulation results confirm that 1) the pilot contamination effect decays, as the number of receive antennas and the data length increase; and 2) that the proposed approach outperforms both kurtosis-based cICA and pure subspace projection for the considered scenarios.	blind signal separation;channel state information;independent component analysis;interference (communication);least squares;mimo;mutual information;pilot ace;simulation;singular value decomposition;telecommunications link;test-driven development;zero suppression	Ebrahim Amiri;Ralf R.

Based on results from extreme value theory and product tails, we derive throughput scaling laws when opportunistic relay selection is performed. Assuming partial channel state information at each transmitter (CSIT) and decodeand-forward, half-duplex relays, we investigate how the per-hop throughput depends on the channel gain asymptotic distribution and the relay deployment. In dense networks with λt nodes per m and fixed relay distances, we provide specific scaling laws for Rayleigh, lognormal, and Weibull fading, showing that the throughput is upper bounded by Θ( √ λt). Interestingly, with variable relay distances and location-aware relay selection, we analytically show that regularly varying channel distributions result in enhanced multi-relay diversity gain, achieving linear throughput scaling Θ(λt).	channel state information;duplex (telecommunications);extreme value theory;hoc (programming language);image scaling;location awareness;maxima and minima;rayleigh–ritz method;relay;software deployment;tails;throughput;transmitter	Marios Kountouris;Jeffrey G.

In this paper, we consider collaborative spectrum sensing by a distributed network of CRs from sub-Nyquist samples to overcome the sampling rate bottleneck of the wideband signals a CR usually deals with. We present a joint reconstruction algorithm, Randomized Distributed Simultaneous Iterative Hard Thresholding (RDSIHT) that adapts the original IHT to block sparse and matrix (simultaneous) inputs, as well as distributed collaboration settings. An observation vector is passed around the network as a random walk process, and updated at each iteration by one of the CRs. Simulations show that our algorithm outperforms a distributed collaborative scheme based on the One-Step Greedy Algorithm (OSGA) using randomized gossip, and that its performance converges to that of its centralized version.	centralized computing;cognitive radio;computer simulation;greedy algorithm;iteration;overhead (computing);randomized algorithm;sampling (signal processing);sparse matrix;thresholding (image processing)	Deborah Cohen;Alon Akiva;Barak Avraham;Stacy Patterson;Yonina C.

We assume that the transmitter has no channel state information (CSI) available from either the main channel or the eavesdropper channel. The transmitter uses an in advance given Wyner secrecy code (instead of adapting the code based on CSI). In this case, both reliability and perfect secrecy can be achieved only for a subset of channel states. We identify this channel state set and provide an achievable average secrecy throughput of the block fading wire-tap channel for given reliability and secrecy outage probabilities.	channel state information;confidentiality;downtime;information-theoretic security;throughput;transmitter	Xiaojun Tang;Ruoheng Liu;Predrag Spasojevic	2007	2007 41st Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems	10.1109/CISS.2007.4298441	binary erasure channel;transmitter;telecommunications;computer science;channel state information;fading;precoding;statistics;computer network	Mobile	34.173164963250066	69.70294915181985	27322

We establish single-letter characterizations of the informationrate region of this problem for both i) a class of discrete memoryless sources and ii) memoryless vector Gaussian sources. Furthermore, assuming a sum constraint on rate or complexity, for both models we develop Blahut-Arimoto type iterative algorithms that allow to compute optimal information-rate trade-offs, by iterating over a set of self-consistent equations.

The optimality of suggested coding is achieved in terms of the capacity versus outage performance. The well-known optimal coding rule relies on Gaussian codewords spanned over the whole available finite set of parallel channels. We prove that the equivalent preprocessing to the ideal interleaving is to re-code independent parallel channels codewords by a linear inner precoder from a special class of unitary precoders complying with the optimality criterion derived in the paper. Performing such linear mixture of codewords sharing common Gaussian block-wise codebook, the same capacity versus the outage is guaranteed without any interleaving over parallel channels. We utilize a virtual multiple access (VMA) channel approach to derive the optimality criterion. Selected precoders with various space-time or time-only domain span were tested against this criterion and we provide the optimality results on variety of the channel parameters. We showed that the temporal processing is the most important one to achieve the optimality of the precoder. A full space-time precoding does not perform better than one which is temporal-only.

The concept behind the proposed technique builds on the fact that both the desired and interfering signals originate from the base station (BS) of the downlink system itself. Based on this observation, the proposed method influences the resulting interference, to reduce the transmission power required to cancel it, without altering the information content of the downlink message. The aim is to bring the interference closer to the replicas of the desired symbols for all users in the THP modulo-extended constellation. In this way, the power required to pre-subtract interference is decreased. Theoretical and simulation results both confirm that, by optimizing the interference to be canceled, the proposed technique offers a considerable transmit power reduction compared to conventional THP while securing an equal error rate performance.	align (company);interference (communication);mimo;mimo-ofdm;modulo operation;self-information;simulation;telecommunications link;transmitter	Christos Masouros;Mathini Sellathurai;Tharmalingam Ratnarajah	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings	10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283923	multi-user mimo;telecommunications;zero-forcing precoding;control theory;mathematics;spatial multiplexing;precoding;statistics	Arch	39.37518610798938	83.2710804370669	27432

For such system, when a large processing gain is employed, substantial time is consumed in computing the filter tap weights. Many schemes for reducing the complexity of the MMSE have been proposed in recent years. In this paper, computational complexity reduction of the MMSE receiver is achieved by using the K-mean classification algorithm. The performance of the uncoded and coded systems are investigated for the full rank MMSE receiver and reduced rank MMSE receiver and results are compared in terms of bit error rate at different loading levels in both AWGN and fading channels. A system with the matched filter (MF) receiver is also presented for the purpose of comparison and an analytical pair-wise error bound for the coded system is derived. In the adaptive implementation of the receivers, results show that good performance is achieved for the reduced rank receiver when compared to the full rank receiver in both coded and uncoded systems, while in the optimum implementation of the tap weights, the reduced dimension receiver performance experiences degradation when compared to the full rank scheme. Over the band-limited channels considered, results for the reduced rank receiver also reiterate the fact that higher code rates tend to yield lower BER than that of low rate codes.

In the discussion, we focus on the ZF and the MRT/MRC linear processing techniques which are commonly used in the massive MIMO systems. Monte- Carlo simulations show that our approximation is very close to the real result, and the shared- antenna full-duplex massive MU-MIMO system significantly outperforms the half-duplex system in terms of spectral efficiency when the scale of antenna array is large enough.	approximation algorithm;channel state information;duplex (telecommunications);mimo-ofdm;multi-user mimo;simulation;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;test-driven development;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Pengbo Xing;Ju Liu;Chao Zhai	2016	2016 IEEE 83rd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2016.7504486	3g mimo;electronic engineering;multi-user mimo;telecommunications link;telecommunications;engineering;control theory;mathematics;silicon;precoding;statistics;mimo	Mobile	38.581882107354666	79.20740597236652	27477

We consider the scenarios where the number of receiver antennas is smaller than the total number of users, but the number of active users is relatively small. This prior information motivates sparsity-embracing MUDs such as sparsity-embracing linear/nonlinear MUDs where the detection of active users and their symbol detection are employed. In addition, sparsity-embracing MUDs with maximum a posteriori probability criterion (MAP-MUDs) are presented. They jointly detect active users and their symbols by exploiting the probability of user activity, and it can be solved efficiently by introducing convex relaxing senses. Furthermore, it is shown that sparsity-embracing MUDs exploiting common users' activity across multiple symbols, i.e., frame-by-frame, can be considered to improve performance. Also, in multiple multiple-input and multiple-output networks with aggressive frequency reuse, we propose the interference cancellation strategy for the proposed sparsity-embracing MUDs. That first cancels out the interference induced by adjacent networks and then recovers the desired users' information by exploiting the low user activity. In simulation studies for binary phase shift keying modulation, numerical evidences establish the effectiveness of our proposed MUDs exploiting low user activity, as compared with the conventional MUD.	compressed sensing;convex function;interference (communication);key (cryptography);low-power broadcasting;mimo;mud;modulation;multi-user;multiuser dos;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;sensor;simulation;sparse matrix;word sense	Junho Lee	2013	Journal of Communications and Networks	10.1109/JCN.2013.000051	detector;real-time computing;telecommunications;antenna;interference;statistics;mimo	Mobile	40.156894808684356	88.32754015539261	27540

More specifically, the capacity is achieved using (i) rate splitting, (ii) functional-decode-forward, and (iii) joint source-channel coding. We note that while separate source-channel coding can achieve the common-rate capacity, joint source-channel coding is used to achieve the capacity for the general case where the users are transmitting at different rates.	channel capacity;forward error correction;relay;transmitter	Lawrence Ong;Sarah J.

Although PMD value in typical standard single mode fiber is quite low (less than 0.2 ps/âkm for ITU-T G.652D standard fiber) higher data rates sets higher requirements for signal quality. In this research comparison between three different modulation formats (traditional on-off keying, differential phase shift keying (DPSK) and polarization shift keying (PolSK)) is given at different optical fiber PMD levels and data transmission rates. It is found that most significant impact of PMD is to traditional on-off keying modulation format, but the best performance showed DPSK modulated signals.	birefringence;differential phase;key (cryptography);line code;modulation;on-off keying;optical fiber;pmd;polarization (waves);polarization mode dispersion;requirement	Jurgis Porins;Girts Ivanovs;Andis Supe;Gunars Cauna	2012	2012 Seventh International Conference on Broadband, Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications	10.1109/BWCCA.2012.54	birefringence;quadrature amplitude modulation;polarization rotator;telecommunications;amplitude and phase-shift keying;computer science;intensity modulation;polarization mode dispersion;dispersion-shifted fiber;cross-phase modulation;polarization-maintaining optical fiber;optical attenuator;analog transmission;graded-index fiber;optical performance monitoring;plastic optical fiber;multi-mode optical fiber;wavelength-division multiplexing;optical modulation amplitude;fiber-optic communication;optical cross-connect;zero-dispersion wavelength;optical communications repeater	Visualization	41.51566689093607	79.5947913578972	27562

Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a proper and efficient modulation scheme for CR. Adaptive beamforming technique improves CR reliable communication by strengthening the desired signals and rejecting interferences. In this paper, two post IFFT/FFT OFDM adaptive beamformers with iterative weights computing are proposed. The first one directly heritages the spectrum masking concept and deactivates the weights for the OFDM CR subcarriers, which hold the same frequency bands with the Licensed Users (LU). Another beamformer adds extra constraints to those weights instead of masking them, directs the main beam towards the CR users and nulls towards the LU and interferences, and consequently shares the same spectrum bands with LU. Simulation results show that both two OFDM adaptive beamformers guarantee that the CR system not to disturb the LU. Furthermore, it is shown that beamforming with constrained weights provides a lower BER, higher bit rate, more efficient spectrum usage, and suffers no side lobe interference from the LU.

However, the acquisition of the global channel state information for IA leads to unacceptable overhead in the massive MIMO systems. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose an IA and soft-space-reuse (IA-SSR)-based cooperative transmission scheme under the two-stage precoding framework. Specifically, the cell-center and the cell-edge users are separately treated to fully exploit the spatial degrees of freedoms. Then, the optimal power allocation policy is developed to maximize the sum-capacity of the network. Next, a low-cost channel estimator is designed for the proposed IA-SSR framework. Some practical issues in IA-SSR implementation are also discussed. Finally, plenty of numerical results are presented to show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.	algorithm;channel state information;computer simulation;interference (communication);mimo;numerical analysis;overhead (computing)	Jianpeng Ma;Shun Zhang;Hongyan Li;Nan Zhao;Victor C.

Recently, there has been a lot of interest in the design of massive uncoordinated multiple access schemes for such systems based on clever enhancements to slotted ALOHA. A close connection has been established between the design of the multiple access scheme and the design of low density generator matrix codes. Based on this connection, optimal multiple access schemes have been designed based on slotted ALOHA and successive interference cancellation, assuming that the number of users in the network is known at the transmitters. In this paper, we extend this work and consider the design of universal uncoordinated multiple access schemes that are agnostic to the number of users in the network. We design Markov chain based transmission policies and numerical results show that substantial improvement to slotted ALOHA is possible.	bell laboratories layered space-time;code;generator matrix;interference (communication);markov chain;numerical analysis;transmitter;wireless access point	Austin Taghavi;Avinash Vem;Jean-François Chamberland;Krishna R.

The primary user emulation attack (PUEA), a special attack of the spectrum sensing technology in CR Networks, reduces the spectrum utilization obviously. And our analysis reveals the undetected PUEA can prevent unlicensed users from accessing the space licensed spectrum effectively. In this paper, we propose the maximum-minimum eigenvalue detection-based method to mitigate the effect of the undetected PUEA in CR networks with correlated signals and spatially-correlated shadow fading. In our proposed method, the spatial correlation characteristic is used to select users attending the cooperation of the spectrum sensing. Simulation results show that our proposed method can effectively mitigate the effect of the PUEA.	cognitive radio;emulator;simulation	Fayu Liu;Huifang Chen;Lei Xie;Kuang Wang	2011	2011 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2011.6096834	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	35.07285920583168	84.16707110389706	27783
811b230f6036282cb480119a8bf285c4830b2723	delay performance of wireless communications with imperfect csi and finite-length coding		With the rise of critical machine-to-machine applications, next generation wireless communication systems must meet challenging requirements with respect to latency and reliability. A key question in this context relates to channel state estimation, which allows the transmitter to adapt the code rate to the channel state. In this paper, we characterize the tradeoff between the training sequence length and data codeword length: shorter channel estimation leaves more time for the payload transmission but reduces the estimation accuracy and causes more decoding errors. Using lower coding rates can mitigate this effect, but may result in a higher backlog of data at the transmitter. In order to optimize the training sequence length and the rate adaptation scheme with respect to the delay performance, we employ queuing analysis on top of accurate models of the physical layer. We obtain an analytically tractable solution to the problem by deriving a closed-form approximation for the decoding error probability due to imperfect channel knowledge and finite-blocklength channel coding. The optimized training sequence length and rate adaptation strategy can reduce the delay violation probability by an order of magnitude, compared with suboptimal strategies that do not consider the delay constraints.

To suppress the effect of interference, forward error correction (FEC) metric masking is proposed. In the technique, log-likelihood ratio (LLR) that corresponds to superposed band is set to zero, because received bits that correspond to superposed band is unreliable. However, to apply FEC metric masking, the information about superposed band must be known at the receiver beforehand. Furthermore, the received bits contain channel estimation error, which is a cause of degradation. In this paper, we propose an iterative estimation technique of power of undesired signal (noise, interference, and channel estimation error) for superposed multicarrier transmission. We use the estimated power of the undesired signal to calculate the LLR that takes the channel estimation error into account, since including this extra information about the channel improves the BER. The proposed scheme estimates the power of undesired signal on each subcarrier, thus the information about superposed band is not required. Simulation results show that the accuracy of estimating undesired signal becomes more reliable as the number of estimation increases, so that BER becomes better as a result of iterative estimation.	channel state information;elegant degradation;error detection and correction;forward error correction;interference (communication);iteration;iterative method;lucas–lehmer–riesel test;noise (electronics);quantum superposition;simulation;subcarrier;unsharp masking;x.690	Yohei Shibata;Naotoshi Yoda;Tomoaki Ohtsuki;Jun Mashino;Takatoshi Sugiyama	2014	2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)	10.1186/s13638-015-0268-7	telecommunications;computer science	Arch	48.87326576741063	80.5351347173243	27808

FDMA techniques at the subcarrier level are exploited to accommodate multiple users. The system is intended for low (1–10 kbps) and medium (100–1000 kbps) bit rate, and short-range WPAN systems. A wideband delay-line FM demodulator that is not preceded by any limiting amplifier constitutes the key component of the UWBFM receiver. This unusual approach permits multiple users to share the same RF bandwidth. Multipath, however, may limit the useful subcarrier bandwidth to one octave. This paper addresses the performance with AWGN and multipath, the resistance to narrowband interference, as well as the simultaneous detection of multiple FM signals at the same carrier frequency. SPICE and Matlab simulation results illustrate the principles and limitations of this new technology.

The coding problem is formulated using minimax techniques, in which the maximum of the average codeword length over the class of distributions is minimized subject to Kraft inequality. Firstly, the maximization over the class of distributions is characterized resulting in an equivalent pay-off. consisting of the maximum and minimum codeword length and the average codeword length with respect to the nominal distribution. Secondly, an algorithm is introduced which computes the optimal weight vector as a function of the class radius.

Based on the multidimensional structure of intercell cooperative MIMO-OFDM, the DPC model has been modified by introducing a block QR decomposition (BQRD) algorithm which transforms the multiuser channel to a block lower triangular structure. The overall error performance of the proposed BQRD-based DPC is dominated by the error performance of the last precoded user. To improve the last user's performance, it was, first, shown that, in a system with U active users, the channel gain matrix remains unchanged for any user acting as the last user among all (U−1)! possible permutations of the other users. Then, a greedy algorithm that directly computes U channel gain matrices and obtains a near-optimal precoding order for the last user is proposed. The proposed greedy ordering scheme reduces the computational complexity by a factor of U!/2 compared with the brute force search. Our simulation results confirm that the performance of the greedy ordering scheme approaches that of the brute force search. Furthermore, the authors show that the proposed BQRD-based DPC expands the multiuser rate region and increases the sum rate over block diagonalisation based zero forcing method.	frequency divider;mimo;multiplexing;qr decomposition	Aimal Khan Yousafzai;Mohammad Reza Nakhai	2010	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2009.0512	mathematical optimization;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;qr decomposition	Networks	48.11945035972884	72.36233087848909	27904

Our simulation results provided for both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and uncorrelated Rayleigh (UR) channels demonstrate that these advantages accrue without compromising the attainable bit error ratio (BER) and block error ratio (BLER) performance, when compared with their previously proposed more complex random-construction-based counterparts, as well as with other structured codes of the same length.	additive white gaussian noise;bit error rate;low-density parity-check code;pseudorandomness;rayleigh–ritz method;requirement;simulation;ur, ur/web;utility functions on indivisible goods;x.690	Nicholas Bonello;Sheng Chen;Lajos Hanzo Hanzo	2010	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2010.2050708	block code;electronic engineering;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;error floor;algorithm;statistics	Arch	43.66640090768228	71.6107345280557	28017

In this protocol, communicating pairs (CP) and also relays are partitioned into small clusters; afterwards, each CP-cluster is assigned one relay cluster to improve data transmission. This scheme increases the diversity order (in comparison to the case where each CP exploits its own relay resources with no cooperation), without increasing the transmission cost (such as delay or energy), provided that the clustering-assignment form is optimized. We show that finding the optimal clustering-assignment (in the sense of cost minimization) boils down to the cascade of two graph-theoretic problems, namely graph partitioning and weighted matching, which can be solved efficiently. Moreover, we model the delay as cost, and analyze the expected transmission time.

In this letter, a receiver structure which combines multiuser detection (temporal filtering) and receiver beamforming (spatial filtering) in a multipath environment is considered. Following previous work, we model the receiver as a linear matrix filter and use the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) as the performance criterion. Motivated by the high complexity of the optimum receiver, we propose rank constrained temporal-spatial filters which are simpler and near-optimum. The MSE is minimized subject to a structural constraint, using an iterative algorithm based on alternating minimization. The constraint on the receiver matrix filter narrows down the solution space, which helps to solve the optimization problem more efficiently. The constraint can be set appropriately by the system designer to achieve the desired tradeoff between performance and complexity. Numerical results indicate that a performance close to that of the optimum filter can be achieved with a simple iterative structure, even in highly loaded systems. Adaptive implementation of the rank constrained filters is derived. A new adaptive scheme is proposed which is a combination of the alternating minimization and the least mean squares methods. The convergence properties are investigated along with the effect of the number paths.	adaptive algorithm;beamforming;channel state information;complexity;computer performance;feasible region;interference (communication);iterative method;least mean squares filter;loose coupling;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;multi-user;multipath propagation;norm (social);numerical method;optimization problem;particle filter;systems design;zero suppression	Önder Filiz;Aylin Yener	2004	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2004.837393	filter;minimum mean square error;receiver;optimization problem;minimisation;code division multiple access;mathematical optimization;index term;telecommunications;receptor;computer science;mathematics;mean squared error;iterative method;computational complexity theory;beamforming;spatial filter;statistics;low-rank approximation;systems design	Vision	53.72563599788388	74.80050815040701	28046

While being cost-effective, such a solution can cause significant measurement errors due to phase noise and frequency offset in the local oscillators. In this paper, we systematically analyze the resulting errors and show that, in practice, overestimation of channel capacity by several hundred percent can occur. Overestimation is caused by phase noise (and to a lesser extent by frequency offset), leading to an increase of the MIMO channel rank. Our analysis furthermore reveals that the impact of phase errors is, in general, most pronounced if the physical channel has low rank (typical for line-of-sight or poor scattering scenarios). The extreme case of a rank-1 physical channel is analyzed in detail. The capacity bounds derived in this paper show excellent agreement with measurement results. In light of the findings of this paper, the results obtained through MIMO channel measurement campaigns using TDMS-based channel sounders should be interpreted with great care.	automatic sounding;channel capacity;frequency offset;line-of-sight (missile);mimo;mike lesser;multiplexing;phase noise;radio frequency;two-phase commit protocol	Daniel S.

Few papers, however, make deep analysis on the relation between these two techniques. Based on Saleh's memoryless traveling wave tube amplifier (TWTA) model, computer simulations and analysis in this paper demonstrates that, especially when the HPA is working near or in the saturation region, a predistorter ceases to be in effect. In such cases, PAPR reduction techniques may be resorted to help to improve the adjacent channel interference (ACI), BER performances and HPA efficiency.

This paper investigates the performance of the LSIC when random spreading sequences are employed. Specifically, the conditional mean and the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the decision variable in each stage are derived to quantify the effects due to imperfect symbol and amplitude estimates. In addition, under the constraint that each user must achieve a certain SINR requirement, we examine the received powers needed for each of a specified number of users and the maximum number of users that a system can support when the LSIC is used in a base station.

This paper considers an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based CR spectrum sharing system that assumes random access of primary network subcarriers by secondary users (SUs) and absence of the PU's spectrum utilization information, i.e., no spectrum sensing is employed to acquire information about the PU's activity or availability of free subcarriers. In the absence of information about the PU's activity, the SUs randomly access (utilize) the subcarriers of the primary network and collide with the PU's subcarriers with a certain probability. In addition, inter-cell collisions among the subcarriers of SUs (belonging to different cells) can occur due to the inherent nature of random access scheme. This paper conducts a stochastic analysis of the number of subcarrier collisions between the SUs' and PU's subcarriers assuming fixed and random number of subcarriers requirements for each user. The performance of the random scheme in terms of capacity and capacity (rate) loss caused by the subcarrier collisions is investigated by assuming an interference power constraint at PUs to protect their operation.	capacity loss;cognitive radio;emoticon;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);iteration;marginal model;multiplexing;one-class classification;quality of service;random access;random number generation;randomness;requirement;software propagation;subcarrier;whole earth 'lectronic link	Sabit Ekin;Mohamed M.

This is accomplished by overlaying M excess symbols to each block of N primary symbols, with the excess symbol period being equal to N times the primary symbol period. The resulting interference between primary and excess symbols is handled using a joint symbol detection technique. Our analysis shows that for BPSK or QPSK modulation and M=1 or M=3, transmission of the excess data rate does not degrade minimum Euclidean distance when the excess symbol ratio M/N does not exceed 25%. Furthermore, our simulation results indicate that at bit error rate (BER) values in the order of 10 to 10, transmission of the additional data in these cases is achieved at the expense of a moderate to very small penalty in signal-tonoise ratio (SNR).	bit error rate;data rate units;euclidean distance;hadamard transform;interference (communication);modulation;offset binary;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;transmitter;uncompressed video;x.690	Frederik Vanhaverbeke;Marc Moeneclaey;Hikmet Sari	2000		10.1109/GLOCOM.2000.891270	symbol rate;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;euclidean distance;mathematics;signal-to-noise ratio;spread spectrum;physical layer;detection theory	Mobile	43.62739853044834	78.68766372929026	28444

Up-scaling of conventional 4×4 small-scale MIMO implementations to MaMi is prohibitive in-terms of flexibility, as well as area and power cost. This work discloses a 1.1mm2 128×8 MaMi baseband chip, achieving up to 12dB array and 2× spatial multiplexing gains. The area cost compared to previous state-of-the-art MIMO implementations [2–3], is reduced by 53% and 17% for up- and down-link, respectively. Algorithm optimizations and a highly flexible framework were evaluated on real measured channels. Extensive hardware time multiplexing lowered area cost, and leveraging on flexible FD-SOI body bias and clock gating resulted in an energy efficiency of 6.56nJ/QRD and 60pJ/b at 300Mb/s detection rate.	algorithm;baseband processor;clock gating;cooperative mimo;image scaling;imperative programming;qr decomposition;requirement;spatial multiplexing;telecommunications link	Hemanth Prabhu;Joachim Neves Rodrigues;Liang Liu;Ove Edfors	2017	2017 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC)	10.1109/ISSCC.2017.7870260	embedded system;electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications link;logic gate;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;operating system;spatial multiplexing;multiplexing;mimo	EDA	29.15507156214825	61.7380682498732	28457

An optimal relay placement scheme is proposed to achieve the lowest outage probability, enable the links to bypass obstacles of various geometric shapes, and place the relay nodes in specified available regions. When the number of relay nodes is large, the searching space can grow exponentially, and thus, a grouping optimization technique is proposed to reduce the searching time. We numerically demonstrate that the grouping optimization can provide suboptimal solutions close to the optimal solutions, but the average searching time linearly grows with the number of relay nodes. Two useful theorems are presented to reveal insights into the optimal relay locations. Simulation results show that our proposed optimization framework can effectively provide desirable solution to the problem of optimal relay nodes placement.	blocking (computing);direction finding;downtime;end-to-end principle;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;relay;simulation;xslt/muenchian grouping	Bingcheng Zhu;Julian Cheng;Mohamed-Slim Alouini;Lenan Wu	2015	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2015.2434945	mathematical optimization;link access procedure for frame relay;laser;telecommunications;shape;computer science;linear programming;mathematics;relay channel;fading;wireless	Visualization	31.725441037224712	83.68509291274464	28562

Multi-cell cooperation technique is an effective way to improve the system throughput and especially the performance of the cell edge users. In a Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) system, the rate loss caused by quantization error of Channel State Information (CSI) is minimized considering two aspects of the channels. Firstly, as the physical conditions and constraints of different users are not identical, appropriately allocating feedback bits to users based on their channels can achieve higher throughput. Secondly, in a Coordinated Beamforming/Coordinated Scheduling (CB/CS) system, each user has a serving channel to the serving base station and an interfering channel to the coordinated base station. The user needs to partition its available bits between the two channels. Thus, we study a global bit allocation strategy that can minimize the rate loss from that of the full CSI circumstance. From our simulation results, we prove that the proposed bit allocation strategy achieves higher per-cell sum-rate compared with the equal bit allocation strategy.	beamforming;block code;channel state information;feedback;multi-user;norm (social);quantization (signal processing);scheduling (computing);serving channel;simulation;throughput	Jiamei Qin;Meng Zhang;Hanwen Luo;Huiye Qiu	2012	2012 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2012.6542849	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering	Mobile	39.20740205079575	85.05995106733091	28596

In this network, two relay nodes exploit the amply-and-forward (AF) protocol and space-time network coding (STNC) to help two source nodes exchange information simultaneously. We assume only one relay node is solar-powered and equipped with a finite-capacity battery. The optimal transmission policy for the EH relay is proposed to minimize the long-term PEP by considering the causal EH information, battery energy and stochastic channel status. Thus, the design framework is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP). We reveal that the full diversity order is achievable only if the EH relay's battery empty probability is equal to zero. Further, the PEP performance can be improved when the battery empty probability becomes smaller. Simulations validate the theoretical analysis and show that the proposed optimal policy outperforms other myopic policies.	causal filter;computer simulation;exception handling;exponential hierarchy;linear network coding;mahdiyar;markov chain;markov decision process;pairwise error probability;relay	Wei Li;Meng-Lin Ku;Yan Chen;K.

Massive MIMO requires handling with large-scale matrix computation, especially for matrix inversion. In this letter, we find that matrix inversion based on Newton iteration (NI) is suitable for data detection in massive MIMO system. In contrast with recently proposed polynomial expansion (PE) method for matrix inversion, we analyze both the algorithm complexity and precision in detail, and propose a diagonal band Newton iteration (DBNI) method, which is an approximate method for NI. Compared with PE method, DBNI can obtain higher precision and approximately equal complexity, and we give an explanation of how to select the bandwidth of DBNI.	approximation algorithm;channel state information;computation;inverse transform sampling;iteration;multi-user mimo;newton;newton's method;numerical linear algebra;polynomial expansion	Chuan Tang;Cang Liu;Luechao Yuan;Zuocheng Xing	2016	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2514281	nickel;algorithm design;mathematical optimization;estimation;theoretical computer science;antenna;mathematics;approximation algorithm;statistics;mimo	ML	51.33367102158154	80.97617082045709	28629
6cbac12e42b4080b3999dcc67c2159f49f27341f	finite blocklength performance of multi-terminal wireless industrial networks		This work focuses on the performance of multi-terminal wireless industrial networks, where the transmissions of all terminals are required to be scheduled within a tight deadline. The transmissions thus share a fixed amount of resources, i.e., symbols, while facing short blocklengths due to the low-latency requirement. We investigate two distinct relaying strategies, namely best relay selection among the participating terminals and best antenna selection at the access point of the network. In both schemes, we incorporate the cost of acquiring instantaneous Channel State Information (CSI) at the access point within the transmission deadline. An error probability model is developed under the finite blocklength regime to provide accurate performance results. As a reference, this model is compared to the corresponding infinite bocklength error model. Both analytical models are validated by simulation. We show that the average Packet Error Rate (PER) over all terminals is convex in the target error probability at each single link. Moreover, we find that: (i) The reliability behavior is different for the two strategies, while the limiting factors are both finite blocklengths and overhead of acquiring CSI. (ii) With the same order of diversity, best antenna selection is more reliable than best relay selection. (iii) The average PER is increasing in the number of participating terminals unless the terminals also act as relay candidates. In particular, if each participating terminal is a candidate for best relay selection, the PER is convex in the number of terminals.	bit error rate;channel state information;overhead (computing);relay;simulation;wireless access point	Yulin Hu;Martin Serror;Klaus Wehrle;James Gross	2016	CoRR		telecommunications	Metrics	33.80848108193708	79.00799842771103	28637

Furthermore, we present a precoding scheme that the BS can use to maximize the signal-to-interference plus noise-ratio (SINR). The proposed algorithm performs well under high speed channels. The limitations of the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) receiver have been discussed and it was used for comparison purposes with the proposed approach. Finally, an interference free scenario is used as a benchmark to evaluate the proposed system performance.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);compaq lte;interference (communication);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;telecommunications link;throughput;user experience	Rana A.

In this paper, we investigate the optimal content placement maximizing the successful offloading probability in a cache- enabled HetNet where a tier of multi-antenna macro BSs (MBSs) is overlaid with a tier of helpers with caches. Based on probabilistic caching framework, we resort to stochastic geometry theory to derive the closed-form successful offloading probability and formulate the caching probability optimization problem, which is not concave in general. In two extreme cases with high and low user-to-helper density ratios, we obtain the optimal caching probability and analyze the impacts of BS density and transmit power of the two tiers and the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) threshold. In general case, we obtain the optimal caching probability that maximizes the lower bound of successful offloading probability and analyze the impact of user density. Simulation and numerical results show that when the ratios of MBS-to-helper density, MBS-to-helper transmit power and user-to- helper density, and the SINR threshold are large, the optimal caching policy tends to cache the most popular files everywhere.	backhaul (telecommunications);cache (computing);concave function;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;multitier architecture;numerical analysis;optimization problem;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation	Dong Liu;Chenyang Yang	2016	2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7842078	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;base station;wireless network;antenna;interference;probabilistic logic;signal-to-noise ratio;computer network	Mobile	30.711388353311612	85.67743475849956	28677

Characterizing the secrecy capacity of nondegraded compound wiretap channels is a challenging problem in information theory. This paper considers the class of parallel Gaussian compound wiretap channels with only one possible channel realization for the legitimate receiver and characterizes the secrecy capacity. (Such parallel Gaussian compound wiretap channels are generally nondegraded.) Moreover, it is shown that the proposed coding scheme strictly outperforms the best known single-letter scheme with Gaussian codebooks.	codebook;information theory	Tie Liu;Vinod M.

0c331d1e7432332ec9bff6c1003c00405ce63ef4	achievable dof-delay trade-offs for the $k$ -user mimo interference channel with delayed csit	interference channel;interference;degrees of freedom;receivers;interference alignment;precoding;delayed channel state information;transmitters;signal to noise ratio;mimo;article;integrated circuits	The degrees of freedom (DoFs) of the K-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) interference channel are studied when perfect, but delayed channel state information is available at the transmitter side (delayed CSIT). Recent works have proposed schemes improving the DoF knowledge of the interference channel, but at the cost of developing transmission involving many channel uses (long delay), thus increasing the complexity at both transmitter and receiver side. This paper proposes three linear precoding strategies, limited to at most three phases, based on the concept of interference alignment, and built upon three main ingredients: delayed CSIT precoding, user scheduling, and redundancy transmission. In this respect, the interference alignment is realized by exploiting delayed CSIT to align the interference at the non-intended receivers along the space-time domain. Moreover, a new framework is proposed where the number of transmitted symbols and duration of the phases is obtained as the solution of a maximization problem, and enabling the introduction of complexity constraints, which allows deriving the achievable DoF as a function of the transmission delay, i.e., the achievable DoF-delay trade-off. Finally, the latter part of this paper settles that the assumption of time-varying channels common along all the literature on delayed CSIT is indeed unnecessary.	align (company);channel state information;entropy maximization;interference (communication);mimo;scheduling (computing);transmitter;zero-forcing precoding	Marc Torrellas;Adrian Agustin;Josep Vidal	2016	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2016.2616348	transmitter;telecommunications;zero-forcing precoding;control theory;mathematics;interference;degrees of freedom;signal-to-noise ratio;precoding;statistics;mimo	Mobile	35.94647222013284	73.22407545804883	28768

The least squared estimated channel frequency responses (CFR's) on pilot tones are used to generate the auto-correlation matrices with/without a known lag, from which the time correlation function can be measured. The maximum Doppler spread is acquired by inverting the time correlation function. Since the noise term will bias the estimator, the estimated CFR's are projected onto the delay subspace of the channel to reduce the bias term as well as the computation complexity. Furthermore, the subspace tracking algorithm is adopted to automatically update the delay subspace. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed algorithm can quickly converge to the true values for a wide range of SNR's and Doppler spreads in Rayleigh fading channels.	autocorrelation;computation;converge;doppler effect;frequency response;genetic algorithm;rayleigh fading;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Xiaochuan Zhao;Tao Peng;Ming Yang;Wenbo Wang	2008	IEEE GLOBECOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.850	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;information theory;computer science;mathematics;statistics	EDA	50.243137258914786	77.58459038026986	28801

According to regulation of DAA in world-wide radio frequency, many detection schemes have been studied and time-domain coherent detection (TDCD) scheme is known as the best approach with respect to the detection performance. However, this scheme requires the additional filter and down-sampler to reconstruct victim signal from the received signal and these requirements lead to increase of hardware complexity. The proposed frequencydomain coherent detection (FDCD) scheme is based on the cross-correlation with frequency-domain reference sequences (FDRS), which are derived from the preamble sequence of the victim system. The detection performance is almost the same as that of the TDCD scheme and the computational complexity is about half.	carrier recovery;coherence (physics);computational complexity theory;cross-correlation;fast fourier transform;radio frequency;requirement;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;ultra-wideband	Sangmin Lee;Yunho Jung;Jaeseok Kim	2013	Telecommunication Systems	10.1007/s11235-011-9635-9	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;ultra-wideband	Embedded	50.71803969544774	78.51231017361783	28816

This abundant bandwidth at 60 GHz has the ability to provide high data throughput (Multi-Gbps throughput) in Wireless Networks. But they have a limitation on range due to larger propagation and penetration losses. Use of High Gain Directional Antennas can overcome this limitation. In this paper, our focus is to Optimize the Placement of Wi-Fi Access Points (APs) and provide Multi-Mbps throughput for all the regions using 2.4 GHz spectrum and Multi-Gbps throughput for priority regions using 60 GHz spectrum in the considered indoor scenario. We implement a Dual-Band architecture which has both low-cost commodity Wi-Fi radio (2.4 GHz) and a High Gain Directional Antennas for 60 GHz transmission. Further we maximize the coverage of 60 GHz spectrum using Power Optimization.		M R Shashi Kiran;M Spoorthi Yadav;R V Hemanth Kumar;M. R.

On-off keying (OOK) is oneof themostpopularnon-coherent modulationoptionsthathasbeenconsidered for energy detectors.OOK basedimplementationof energy detectorsis achievedby passingthesignalthrough a squarelaw device (suchas a Schottky diode operatingin square-region) followed by an integrator and a decisionmechanism, wherethedecisionsaremadeby comparingtheoutputsof theintegratorwith a threshold. Two challengingissuesfor the enhancement of energy detectorrecei vers are the estimationof the optimal threshold,and the determinationof synchronization/dumpointsof the integrator. The effect of integration interval on the systemperformancehasbeenanalyzedbefore for energy detectors [1], [3]. However, to our bestknowledge,optimal joint selectionof the integrationstart andstop times, and the thresholdis not covered in the literature. In this work, our contributions are as follows: 1We addressthe optimal joint parameterselectionusing the bit error rate (BER) expressionswith exact analysis and Gaussianapproximation(GA), and show that GA works well only at large bandwidths,2We definea framework for synchronization/dumphypotheseswith differentsamplingoptions,3When an exact analysis is considered,using the GA for calculating the thresholdyields very small performancelosses,and can be consideredasapracticalalternati vefor exactthresholdevaluation,4Theparameterestimationrequiresexplicit BER minimization(ratherthanSNR maximization)sincethe statisticscorrespondingto differentbits arenot identical,5The numberof training symbolsrequiredto converge to the ideal parameterestimatesis shown to be lessthanonehundredfor practicaloperatingscenarios.

We propose two techniques to achieve the fast start-up equalization without an error propagation. The first one is a channel estimation scheme, which consists of a tap-selected correlation and a modified least-mean-square algorithm, to estimate accurately long and complex channels. The second one is a general training DFE (GT-DFE) to overcome the shortage of a training sequence in the VSB signal. The GT-DFE calculates the coefficients of the DFE prior to the equalization with the knowledge of the channel estimation, reference tap (symbol timing of DFE) and its position, i.e., decision delay, in the feedforward filter (FFF). Simulation results show that the proposed channel estimation scheme provides a reliable performance comparable to that of conventional schemes. It is also shown that a GT-DFE-based DFE provides 7dB~9 dB higher start-up signal to interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) as compared to the DFE without the GT-DFE in severe channels. Moreover, the GT-DFE-based DFE provides a faster convergence speed as much as 2.4times106~6times10 6 symbols to converge within 1 dB of the final SINR as compared to the DFE without the GT-DFE	algorithm;channel state information;coefficient;converge;equalization (communications);feed forward (control);feedforward neural network;fused filament fabrication;geforce 600 series;interference (communication);logitech driving force gt;propagation of uncertainty;scheme;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;single-sideband modulation;software propagation	JongSeob Baek;Sungwoo Park;Jong-Soo Seo	2007	IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting	10.1109/TBC.2006.887171	electronic engineering;digital television;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;control theory;statistics	Mobile	50.14144785812569	73.15692202912537	29086

Nevertheless, because the total available transmit power is split uniformly across transmit antennas in MIMO-OFDM systems, increasing the number of transmit antennas leads to a smaller signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per degree of freedom. Thus the coverage performance of this kind of MIMO-OFDM system becomes an essential issue. In this paper by means of order statistics and Glivenko-Cantelli theorem, we develop an analytical expressions for the link outage probability and cell coverage reliability of OFDM-based spatial multiplexing systems in a frequency selective fading channel, respectively.	frequency divider;mimo;mimo-ofdm;modulation;next-generation network;profiling (computer programming);signal-to-noise ratio;spatial multiplexing;sun outage	Li-Chun Wang;Cheng-Wei Chiu;Chu-Jung Yeh;Wern-Ho Sheen	2007	2007 IEEE 65th Vehicular Technology Conference - VTC2007-Spring	10.1109/VETECS.2007.482	statistical time division multiplexing;electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics;spatial multiplexing;statistics	Visualization	28.30130808582094	82.63200256721595	29117

Interference cancelation is achieved by exploiting the null-space of the channel from the secondary transmitter to the primary receiver. In the wake of a global deployment of the third generation partnership project's (3GPP) long term evolution (LTE), one of the open questions of VFDM concerns its applicability in a primary LTE-orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) multi-user setting. In this work, we address this question by extending VFDM to the multi-user scenario where the primary system employs OFDMA, such as LTE. We show that by using at the secondary system a similar precoder structure to the ones previously studied, we are able to cancel the interference towards multiple primary receivers while still achieving acceptable rates for the secondary system.	ccir system a;channel (communications);compaq lte;frequency divider;interference (communication);kernel (linear algebra);multi-user;multiplexing;overlay network;scenario (computing);software deployment;testbed;transmitter;water filling algorithm	Leonardo S.

We investigate the performance of a downlink massive MIMO with the 1-bit DAC using regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding serving quantized receivers. By taking the quantization errors at both transmitter and receivers, regularization parameter for the RZF is optimized with closed-form solution by applying asymptotic random matrix theory. The optimal parameter is discovered as linearly increasing w.r.t. the user loading ratio. Furthermore, asymptotic sum rate performance is derived and a closed-form expression of the optimal user loading ratio is achieved specifically for low SNR. The optimal user loading is found decreasing with increasing receiver quantization resolutions.

2028f9208057a1cd38fef7f214c27f0563da5b13	fundamental limits of dynamic interference management with flexible message assignments		The problem of interference management is considered in the context of a linear interference network that is subject to long term channel fluctuations due to shadow fading. The fading model used is one where each link in the network is subject independently to erasure with probability p. It is assumed that each receiver in the network is interested in one unique message, which is made available at M transmitters. For the case where M = 1, the cell association problem is considered, and for M > 1, the problem of setting up the backhaul links for Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) transmission is investigated. In both cases, optimal schemes from a Degrees of Freedom (DoF) viewpoint are analyzed for the setting of no erasures, and new schemes are proposed with better average DoF performance at higher probabilities of erasure. Additionally, for M = 1, the average per user DoF is characterized for every value of p, and optimal message assignments are identified. For M > 1, it is first established that there is no strategy for assigning messages to transmitters in networks that is optimal for all values of p. The optimal cooperative zero-forcing scheme for M = 2 is then identified, and shown to be information-theoretically optimal when the size of the largest subnetwork that contains no erased links	assignment (computer science);asymptotically optimal algorithm;backhaul (telecommunications);information theory;interference (communication);network synthesis filters;simulation;subnetwork;transmitter;zero-forcing precoding	Tolunay Seyfi;Yasemin Karacora;Aly El Gamal	2018	CoRR		mathematical optimization;mathematics;fading;interference (wave propagation);subnetwork;erasure;distributed computing;shadow;communication channel	Theory	35.20575194190188	73.28260431922857	29365
8f649df66e8cbfd9d4b49a75ec60198feea6c30d	weighted correlation-based spectrum sensing for cognitive radio in rayleigh fading channels	detectors;cognitive radio;antennas;correlation;signal to noise ratio;reactive power	Correlation-based algorithms are low-complexity spectrum sensing methods requiring little knowledge on primary signals or noise signals. However, their detection performance severely degrades in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime with low signal correlation, which happens to be quite common in practice. In this paper, a weighted correlation- based spectrum sensing scheme and its simplified blind detection scheme are proposed to effectively improve the detection performance. The two proposed algorithms adequately exploit both the auto- correlation and the cross-correlation function statistical characteristics of received signals and assign a proper weight to each term in the test statistics of them, enlarging the differences of test statistics with or without the existence of primary users (PUs), making it easier to detect PUs and thus greatly promoting the detection performance. The weighting operation is verified to be effective from two aspects. The two proposed algorithms are proved robust against noise uncertainty. The false alarm probabilities and detection probabilities are analyzed in the low SNR regime, and their approximate analytical expressions are derived based on the central limit theorem. The analyses are verified through simulations. Experiments with simulated multi-antenna signals show that the proposed detectors can significantly outperform other correlation-based detectors with about 2.2-dB detection performance gain.	approximation algorithm;autocorrelation;automated theorem proving;cognitive radio;computational complexity theory;cross-correlation;experiment;rayleigh fading;requirement;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Xinyu Wang;Min Jia;Qing Guo;Xuemai Gu	2016	2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7842379	detector;cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;antenna;mathematics;ac power;signal-to-noise ratio;correlation;statistics;computer network	Mobile	49.379143477592265	85.50152656082811	29381

This has led to aggressive scaling down of the NAND flash memory cell feature sizes and also increased adoption of flash memories with multiple cell levels to increase the data storage density. These factors have adversely affected the reliability of flash memories.In this dissertation, our main goal is to perform detailed characterization of the errors that occur in multi-level cell (MLC) flash memories and develop novel mathematical channel models that better reflect the measured error characteristics than do current models. The channel models thus developed are applied to error correcting code (ECC) frame error rate (FER) performance estimation in MLC flash memories and to estimating the flash memory channel capacity as represented by the channel models. We also utilize the characterization of inter-cell interference (ICI) errors to evaluate the performance of constrained coding schemes that mitigate ICI and improve the reliability of flash memories.In Chapter 5, which is self-contained, we propose and study modifications to adaptive linear programming decoding techniques applied to decoding polar codes. We also propose a reduced complexity representation of the polar code sparse factor graph, resulting in time complexity improvements in the adaptive LP decoder.	flash memory	Veeresh Taranalli	2017			parallel computing	Theory	44.112112786052485	64.53610582313816	29425

Then the UE throughput is evaluated by considering proportional fair (PF), round robin (RR), and best CQI schedulers at different values of UE throughput CDF. In this paper we analyze that the PF scheduler outperforms other schedulers in fairness and average throughput, while the best CQI scheduler performs good under high SINR region. The RR is the best choice when resource allocation is to be done without considering any kind of channel condition.	additive white gaussian noise;compaq lte;fairness measure;performance evaluation;proportionally fair;rapid refresh;round-robin scheduling;scheduling (computing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;soft-in soft-out decoder;standard sea level;telecommunications link;throughput	Ishtiaq Ahmad;Zeeshan Kaleem;Kyunghi Chang	2013	CoRR		real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	Mobile	28.207960214638813	88.16554576117062	29539
96f85eb9d004c67696dd03cad0d92a1367e6ffe8	capacity-achieving rate-compatible polar codes for general channels		We present a rate-compatible polar coding scheme that achieves the capacity of any family of channels. Our solution generalizes the previous results [1], [2] that provide capacity-achieving rate-compatible polar codes for a degraded family of channels. The motivation for our extension comes from the fact that in many practical scenarios, e.g., MIMO systems and non-Gaussian interference, the channels cannot be ordered by degradation. The main technical contribution of this paper consists in removing the degradation condition. To do so, we exploit the ideas coming from the construction of universal polar codes. Our scheme possesses the usual attractive features of polar codes: low complexity code construction, encoding, and decoding; super-polynomial scaling of the error probability with the block length; and absence of error floors. On the negative side, the scaling of the gap to capacity with the block length is slower than in standard polar codes, and we prove an upper bound on the scaling exponent.	battery management system;block code;elegant degradation;graph coloring;image scaling;interference (communication);mimo;polar code (coding theory);polarization (waves);polynomial;retransmission (data networks);transmitter	Marco Mondelli;S.

Through the use of majorization theory, we derive ergodic capacity bounds for this general class of channels. In the high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regime, we show that a simple expression for the capacity upper bound is available, which reveals the impact of channel fading parameter on the system ergodic capacity. Besides, the asymptotic behavior of the ergodic capacity where the number of antenna(s) at one or both side(s) goes to infinity, is studied. By considering the low SNR regime, on the other hand, we give an approximation and a lower bound for the ergodic capacity.

The large losses in the Friis equation (due to the implied small apertures of mm wave antennas) suggest that high gain antennas are required. The high gain also implies steerability is required. Arrays of patch antennas are one possible low cost solution, but each array has a limited angular field of view. Multiple arrays per node can be used to improve the field of view. Choosing the correct antenna configuration requires a complex cost-benefit analysis and performance-complexity tradeoff. In this paper, we investigate these tradeoffs through system simulations. Our study uses ray tracing in 3D deployment scenarios and realistic patch antenna array models. MATLAB-based system simulation results are provided, and conclusions are drawn to provide insight into the performance vs. antenna complexity of a mm wave based system. Some of the key conclusions are: diminishing returns on performance as the number of arrays are increased, and the fact that a smaller number of larger arrays can outperform a larger number of smaller arrays. Iso-element curves are also presented as another way to perform a cost-benefit analysis.	angularjs;array data structure;blocking (computing);call stack;friis formulas for noise;hardware random number generator;iso 8601;interference (communication);inverted-f antenna;matlab;patch (computing);ray tracing (graphics);requirement;simulation;software deployment;throughput	Steven Ferrante;Philip Pietraski;Tao Deng;Magdalena Bielinski	2015	2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145933	antenna aperture;omnidirectional antenna;reflective array antenna;electronic engineering;random wire antenna;microstrip antenna;telecommunications;antenna measurement;engineering;electrical engineering;directional antenna;conformal antenna;patch antenna;antenna;smart antenna	HPC	25.872140011768554	83.57341642632532	29666
0eb29911f52414b21e9fdc40266017a18ba145db	autonomous coverage expansion of mobile agents via cooperative control and cooperative communication		In this paper, a distributed extremum seeking and cooperative control is designed for mobile agents to disperse themselves optimally in maintaining communication quality and maximizing their coverage. The agents locally form a virtual MIMO communication system, and they communicate among them by using the decode and forward cooperative communication. Outage probability is used as a measure of communication quality which can be estimated real-time. A general performance index balancing outage probability and spatial dispersion is chosen for the overall system. Extremum seeking control approach is used to estimate the optimal values specified by the performance index, and cooperative formation control is applied to move the agents to the optimal locations by using only the locally-available information. The network connectivity and coverage are much improved when compared to either non-cooperative communication approaches or other existing control results. Simulation analysis is carried out to demonstrate the performance and robustness of the proposal methodology, and simulation is done to illustrate its effectiveness.	consensus dynamics	Said Al-Abri;Zhihua Qu	2013		10.1007/978-3-662-43645-5_23	outage probability;robustness (computer science);communications system;mimo;spatial dispersion;distributed computing;computer science	HCI	31.499259860374963	87.93669388684525	29685

If grossly nonlinear power amplifiers are employed, conventional QPSK (Quaternary Phase Shift Keying) or QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) modulations should be replaced by offset modulations such as OQPSK (Offset QPSK) and OQAM (Offset QAM). In fact, offset signals have much lower dynamic range than non-offset signals, with OQPSK signals being able to have an almost constant envelope. This paper considers frequency-domain receiver design for OQPSK and OQAM schemes. It is shown that FDE (Frequency Domain Equalization) designed for non-offset modulations are not suitable for offset modulations due to the residual IQI (In-phase/Quadrature Interference), i.e. the interference between in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components at the sampling instants. Therefore, we propose several FDE designs where there is no IQI in the sampling instants as well as iterative FDE receivers with IQI cancellation. Our receivers have excellent performance, with the linear designs significantly outperforming linear FDE for non-offset modulations and the iterative designs with performance close to the MFB (Matched Filter Bound).	adobe framemaker;amplifier;coefficient;computation;dynamic range;in-phase and quadrature components;interference (communication);iteration;iterative method;lagrange multiplier;matched filter;modulation;nonlinear system;performance;sampling (signal processing)	Miguel Luzio;Rui Dinis;Paulo Montezuma	2012	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2012.051712.100072	electronic engineering;quadrature amplitude modulation;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;phase-shift keying;interference;frequency domain;broadband networks	EDA	51.21328628249101	78.72818468990495	29695

We consider two cases of imperfect channel state information (CSI) feedback: mean feedback and covariance feedback. In both cases, the optimum strategy is shown to be transmission of multiple data streams to the same directions as when maximizing the ergodic channel capacity, but with different power allocation strategies which are closely related to the target rate. In the mean feedback case, the optimal power allocation strategy is also related to the accuracy of the feedback CSI, which affects significantly the achievable outage capacity.	beamforming;channel capacity;channel state information;downtime;ergodicity;feedback;signal-to-noise ratio;system analysis;transmitter	Yongzhe Xie;Costas N.

In this scheme, the information bits are jointly conveyed by the indices of spreading codes and the conventional M-ary modulated symbols. A low-complexity maximum ratio combining (MRC) detector is designed, in which the receiver first detects the selected spreading codes and then the corresponding data symbols are de-spread and demodulated. The bit error probability (BEP) upper bound and the achievable diversity order are analyzed according to the union bounding technique. Simulation results verify the analyses and show that the proposed IM-OFDM-SS outperforms the existing OFDM-IM and OFDM-SS schemes significantly.	bit error rate;channel state information;code;de bruijn graph;frequency divider;mimo-ofdm;modulation;multiplexing;open research;simulation;subcarrier;x.690	Qiang Li;Miaowen Wen;Ertugrul Basar;Fangjiong Chen	2017	2017 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2017.8269169	real-time computing;probability of error;spread spectrum;modulation;maximal-ratio combining;detector;computer science;electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;upper and lower bounds	Mobile	44.23491350039213	78.9268451491347	29721

The proposed scheme adaptively switches between open-loop and closed-loop MIMO modes, depending on the users' channel conditions and required rates, as a means to enhance the system throughput and performance. Each mode is a combination of a MIMO transmission technique (space-time block coding and/or spatial multiplexing or beamforming) and a modulation/coding scheme. We first evaluate the spectral efficiency of each mode and provide a simple way to select adaptively the best mode among the open-loop and closed-loop available transmission modes in a Rayleigh/composite fading environment. Based on these results, we propose a simple and practical switching criterion that is shown to yield significant spectral efficiency improvements over independent adaptive open-loop or closed-loop schemes for typical multiuser system scenarios.

It falls into the spectrum sensing category of the cognitive radio. In this work, we adopt sequential detection for the spectrum sensing, for both a photon-counting receiver and a photomultiplier tube (PMT) receiver. For the PMT receiver, to reduce the computational complexity, we propose a one-term approximation for the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) computation. We also extend the sequential detection to cooperative sensing with multiple photon-counting and PMT receivers. From the simulations, it is seen that the one-term approximation can show a comparable number of samples as that for the exact LLR computation to achieve certain miss detection and false alarm probabilities, significantly fewer than those required by the Gaussian approximation for a low PMT amplification factor. The numbers of samples for both the Gaussian and one-term approximations are close to those for the exact LLR computation for a large PMT amplification factor.	approximation;cognitive radio;computation;computational complexity theory;cryptographic hash function;lucas–lehmer–riesel test;optical wireless;photomultiplier;simulation;telecommunications network;transceiver	Xiaona Liu;Chen Gong;Zhengyuan Xu	2016	IEEE/OSA Journal of Optical Communications and Networking	10.1109/ICCW.2016.7503822	cognitive radio;photonics;telecommunications;computer science;light scattering;wireless	Mobile	38.01632084966073	70.07879296574559	29836

We derive the optimum MAP detector and give some optimized mapping schemes for 16-QAM.

However, the BICM-SPA decoder does not take the statistical dependencies between bits from the same L-ary modulated symbol into account so that it cannot converge to the maximum a-posteriori (MAP) decoding algorithm. In this paper, an improved SPA decoding algorithm for the LDPC code, which combines decoding and demodulation, is proposed. The proposed decoding algorithm, referred to as the BICM-ISPA, is based on generalized distributive law and derived from the generalized symbol SPA under certain rational assumptions. And the BICM-ISPA can asymptotically converge to the MAP decoding solution algorithm. Simulation results show that the BICM-ISPA decoder jointly optimizes the decoding error performance and the computational complexity of the LDPC code over the additive white Gaussian noise channel. Compared with the BICM-SPA decoder, the advantage of the BICM-ISPA is quite significant with a large modulation size and in the scenario where Gray mapping cannot be used.	ansi escape code;additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;belief propagation;computational complexity theory;converge;elegant degradation;gps signals;generalized distributive law;iteration;iterative method;low-density parity-check code;modulation;nx bit;simulation;utility functions on indivisible goods;x.690	Ying Wang;Lei Xie;Huifang Chen;Kuang Wang	2010	IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting	10.1109/TBC.2009.2036950	list decoding;electronic engineering;low-density parity-check code;soft-decision decoder;telecommunications;sequential decoding;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;statistics	ML	43.36066078195843	64.8166727465391	29896

While for common fading models such as the Rayleigh, Rice, and Nakagami, the performance of diversity systems is well understood, a minor attention has been devoted to the shadowed-Rice (SR) case, namely a Rice fading channel with fluctuating (e.g. random) Line of Sight (LOS) component. Indeed, the analytical performance evaluation of diversity systems on SR fading channels requires the availability of handy expressions for the distribution of the combined received power. To this end, the rationale of this paper is twofold: first, to evaluate the distribution of the sum of SR random variables, both for the case of independent as well as correlated LOS components, and then to carry out an extensive performance analysis of maximal ratio combining (MRC) detection scheme on SR fading channels.	channel (communications);channel capacity;design rationale;downtime;ergodicity;handy board;mimo;maximal set;performance evaluation;performance prediction;portable document format;profiling (computer programming);rayleigh–ritz method;regular expression;rice's theorem;sensor	Giuseppa Alfano;Antonio De Maio	2007	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2007.060202	fading distribution;random variable;stochastic process;telecommunications;computer science;diversity scheme;mathematics;channel state information;fading;wireless;statistics	Metrics	39.434483454724386	76.42961059762445	29918

The index of performance is taken as the bit-error rate (BER). The BER results obtained permit the selection of an optimum combination of modulation index and receiver bandwidth. This selection is carried out and is compared for analysis based on both computer simulation and theoretical calculation. The performance of the cross correlator is also compared to that of the limiter–discriminator, and is found to be similar. This is noteworthy because the general I=Q demodulator structure of the cross correlator is ideally suited to DSP chip implementation, and furthermore, severe amplitude limiting does not have to be performed on the input signal to the receiver. Input signal amplitude variations of up to 20% of the average signal value can be tolerated with only a 1-dB loss in performance, and the receiver is completely independent of the rate of amplitude variation. The theoretical analysis of the receiver uses a Fourier series approach [1] which takes into account the effects of FM distortion and intersymbol interference (ISI). Theoretical and simulation results are found to agree within 0.5 dB inEb=No: We also address the issue of timing recovery. Results obtained indicate that losses due to timing error can be reduced to less than 0.5 dB in Eb=No.	bandwidth (signal processing);bit error rate;carrier recovery;computer simulation;cross-correlation;discriminator;distortion;fm broadcasting;interference (communication);limiter;modulation;normalized frequency (unit);sentinel value;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;x.690	Kevin A.

Deriving a simple approximation to the capacity of the network, we show that simple schedules having exactly two states and avoiding broadcast and multiple access communication can still achieve a significant constant fraction of the capacity of the 2 relay network, independent of the channel SNRs. The results are extended to the case of 3 relays for the special class of antisymmetric networks. We also study the structure of (approximately) optimal relaying strategies for such networks. Simulations show that these schedules have at most N + 1 states, which we conjecture to be true in general. We prove the conjecture for N = 2 and for special cases for N = 3.	approximation;computer simulation;duplex (telecommunications);relay	Siddhartha Brahma;Ayfer Özgür;Christina Fragouli	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings	10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283025	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;scheduling	Theory	34.15240148287754	72.57755330131171	30005

Instead of the traditional terminal collaboration or relay tier space-time coding (STC), a relay tier interaction is proposed. Considering time division multiple access (TDMA) scheme, two spatial adjacent vehicles are conjoined by an interaction radio link to create a virtual antenna array (VAA). Then the collaborative two-relay is integrated into a multihop IVC network mentioned above, which enables a single-antenna terminal to share its antenna with other terminals easily, and avoids the synchronization or other complicated requirements in terminal collaboration or STC systems. Furthermore, except the low complexity in hardware implementation, the proposed method also can enhance the performance of the IVC systems over both the quasi-static fading channel and time varying Rayleigh fading relay channel, which is verified through the Monte-Carlo simulations	relay	Xiaojian Xu;Qingmin Meng;Hanying Hu	2006		10.1109/ICICIC.2006.215	telecommunications;mathematics;statistics;computer network;monte carlo method	HCI	42.78886857222385	82.4550559653163	30080

But their ability to provide good error performance has not evinced any interest in large antenna systems because of their very high complexity. However, if the number of erroneous dimensions can be made low, say by some pre-processing, we can use SD for those dimensions. This could potentially improve the error performance at a reasonable complexity. To identify such dimensions, we present a multipath matching pursuit-based approach. Simulation results show that compared to existing algorithms, the proposed approach can provide a significant improvement in error performance.	algorithm;complexity;mimo;matching pursuit;mathematics-mechanization platform;mean squared error;multipath propagation;preprocessor;simulation;sparse matrix	Abhay Kumar Sah;Ajit K.

PFS decisions on which mobile station (MS) to schedule next are based on Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) values. Since CQI values are reported by the MSs to the scheduler, network performance can be severely degraded if some malicious MSs report forged information. Previous approaches to this security issue are based either on modifying PFS, which may be undesirable in some contexts, or authenticating CQI reports by periodic transmission of challenges, which increases overhead. Instead, we propose to detect misreporting attackers, based on the time correlation features of the wireless channel. Our approach does not require scheduler modification, and it does not increase overhead. Simulation results under realistic settings are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed test.	authentication;fairness measure;forward secrecy;merkle signature scheme;multi-user;network performance;overhead (computing);proportionally fair;scheduling (computing);security hacker;simulation	Jorge F.

In conventional multi-user transmission schemes for relay systems where hierarchical modulation is applied, high level power is always assigned to the same mobile user, at both the source and relay node. The performance of one mobile user is always superior to that of the other; therefore, the performance of mobile users is unbalanced. In this paper, we propose a novel multiuser transmission scheme that implements different hierarchical modulation signal in a relay node to achieve balanced bit error rate performance among the mobile users. The strategy we employ is that when high power is allocated to a mobile user at a base station, low power is allocated to the hierarchical modulation signal of the same mobile user at the relay node. Hence, the strengths of the signals at different mobile users, which are a combination of the signals from the base station and relay node, are comparable. Then mobile users can achieve excellent performance simultaneously, and a balanced performance can be obtained by using proposed scheme. Simulation results show effectiveness of proposed scheme.	bit error rate;computer simulation;delta-sigma modulation;high-level programming language;multi-user;numerical analysis;relay;unbalanced circuit;x.690	Chunlin Yan;Anxin Li;Atsushi Harada	2013	2013 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2013.6555156	telecommunications;computer science;relay channel;computer network;modulation	Mobile	32.39674764757904	88.02318230609028	30197

Through adaptively adjusting the initial phases of multiple subcarriers according to the location information, CI (Carrier Interference) sub-carrier waveform synthesis signal could achieve better performance. More specifically, when the carrier arrives at the receiver with a particular phase, the dynamic change of this signal amplitude can be significantly reduced by introducing sinusoidal frequency modulation signals. The method has significance for improving the overall performance of UWB communication system.

To quantify the error performance of the TWRN, a closed-form expression of the overall symbol-error-rate (OSER) is derived for Nakagami-m fading. In addition, to gain further insights on the diversity order, asymptotic expressions of the system OP and OSER are obtained at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Moreover, the joint optimization problems of power allocation and relay location are considered to minimize the asymptotic system OP. Finally, the analytical findings are validated by the simulations.	anisotropic filtering;downtime;mimo;mathematical optimization;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;systems design	Eylem Erdogan;Ali Afana;Tansal Gucluoglu;Salama S.

Closed-form analytical expressions for calculation of the ergodic capacities of these systems are derived. It is shown that systems with nonregenerative fixed gain relays achieve higher ergodic capacities than the corresponding systems with nonregenerative variable gain relays. A modified fixed gain relay, which incorporates the power constraint at the relays, is proposed. It is shown that systems with modified fixed gain relays slightly outperform the corresponding systems with nonregenerative variable gain relays and fixed gain relays at small signal-to-noise ratios, but attain almost the same ergodic capacities as systems with nonregenerative variable gain relays as the signal-to-noise ratio increases. In addition, the ergodic capacity of a hybrid system with both regenerative and nonregenerative relays is studied. Systems with regenerative relays employing decode-and-forward relaying offer higher ergodic capacities than the corresponding systems with any classes of nonregenerative relays or hybrid relays.	channel state information;duplex (telecommunications);ergodic theory;ergodicity;hybrid system;rayleigh fading;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;small-signal model;variable-gain amplifier	Golnaz Farhadi;Norman C.

A comprehensive analysis of a cellular wireless network uplink CCDMA architecture employing two-user asynchronous uniquely decodable (ASUD) codes and over an AWGN channel is presented. A noncoherent reception technique ensures that the CCDMA architecture is practical from an uplink synchronization standpoint.

The proposed method is based on coherent detection and contains two stages. At the first stage, SSS is detected by using estimated channel response at PSCH. Owing to the difference of channels between PSCH and SSCH in TDD mode, the channel response estimated from PSCH does not exactly match the channel response of SSCH and performance degradation is occurred. To mitigate the effect of such channel mismatch problems and improve the cell search reliability, the candidate cells selected at the first stage will be further confirmed by a second coherent detection with channel response estimated from SSCH at the second stage. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed two-stage scheme improves the neighbor cell search performance significantly.	carrier recovery;coherence (physics);compaq lte;elegant degradation;simulation;test-driven development	Baojin Li;Xin Wang	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/icc.2011.5962495	synchronization;real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;coherence;telecommunications;computer science;correlation;computer network	Robotics	46.46497260938811	82.26327772251555	30497

The receiver is based on oversampling the received signal corrupted by noise and nonlinear distortion. Contrary to other solutions in the literature, in the proposed technique there is no need for a bank of matched filters, and the receiver front end reduces to a single lowpass filter. For a given peak power level, a performance gain can be achieved over more traditional approaches to transmission on nonlinear channels, such as those based on predistortion, if a moderate spectral expansion is allowed. To analyze the receiver performance, the concept of distance spectrum is employed, since the minimum distance alone cannot account for a reliable performance evaluation. Both analysis and simulation are carried out for realistic narrowband nonlinear channels, possibly employing reduced-state sequence detection. Appreciable gain margins are confirmed to be possible in these realistic cases.	algorithm;amplifier;analogue filter;approximation;bandlimiting;best, worst and average case;bode plot;branch predictor;chebyshev filter;computer simulation;distortion;hamming distance;low-pass filter;matched filter;modulation;multiple encryption;nonlinear element;nonlinear system;oversampling;performance evaluation;radio frequency;rendering (computer graphics);semiconductor;simulation	Armando Vannucci;Riccardo Raheli	2002	IEEE Trans.

Each client initially has a subset of packets in the ground set X, and wishes to learn all packets in X. The clients exchange their packets with each other by broadcasting coded or uncoded packets. In this paper, we consider a generalization of this problem for the settings in which an unknown (but of a bounded size) subset of clients are adversarial. The adversarial clients can introduce erasures or errors in their packet transmissions in an arbitrary manner. The problem is to find the minimum total number of transmissions required such that, regardless of the configuration of adversarial clients, all non-adversarial clients can learn the maximally recoverable subset of packets in X. For arbitrary problem instances (i.e., arbitrary sets of packets available at the clients), this problem is NP-hard. Focusing on the settings where the packets are distributed randomly among clients, in this work, we propose a linear-time algorithm which solves (with high probability) the special case of the problem with one adversarial client. This result can also be extended to more general cases with arbitrary number of adversarial clients.	adversary (cryptography);algorithm;lossless compression;np-hardness;network packet;randomness;schedule (computer science);time complexity;with high probability	Anoosheh Heidarzadeh;Alexander Sprintson	2016	2016 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)	10.1109/ITA.2016.7888157	database index;linear network coding;real-time computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;programming language;broadcasting;robustness	Theory	31.580339091781436	70.22550449935443	30580
00dacb730a8f86cec67bfa22a91a01dbe56d6c07	maximum secrecy throughput of mimome fso communications with outage constraints		In this paper, we consider a scenario where two multiple-aperture legitimate nodes (Alice and Bob) communicate by means of free-space optical communication in the presence of a multiple-aperture eavesdropper (Eve), which is subject to pointing errors. Two different schemes are considered depending on the availability of channel state information (CSI) at Alice: 1) the adaptive scheme, where Alice possesses the instantaneous CSI with respect to Bob and 2) the fixed-rate scheme, where such information is not available at Alice. The performance of the aforementioned schemes is evaluated in terms of a recently proposed metric named effective secrecy throughput (EST), which encompasses both the reliability and secrecy constraints. By constraining the system to operate below a given maximum allowed secrecy outage probability, we evaluate the EST analytically and through numerical results, showing that the use of multiple apertures at Alice is very important toward achieving the optimal EST.	alice and bob;channel state information;downtime;eve;numerical analysis;throughput	Marcos Eduardo Pivaro Monteiro;João Luiz Rebelatto;Richard Demo Souza;Glauber Gomes de Oliveira Brante	2018	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2018.2815021	optical communication;channel state information;computer network;outage probability;secrecy;throughput;mathematics;alice and bob	Metrics	35.081412707955806	81.89172517605536	30586

In this paper, we investigate cooperative diversity for inter-vehicular communication based on cascaded Rayleigh fading. This channel model provides a realistic description of inter-vehicular channel where two or more independent Rayleigh fading processes are assumed to be generated by independent groups of scatterers around the two mobile terminals. We investigate the performance of amplify-and-forward relaying for an inter-vehicular cooperative scheme assisted by a road-side access point which acts as a relay. Our diversity analysis reveals that the cooperative scheme is able to extract the full distributed spatial diversity. We further formulate a power allocation problem for the considered scheme to optimize the power allocated to broadcasting and relaying phases. Performance gains up to 2.8 dB are observed through optimum power allocation depending on the relay location.	asymptote;channel (communications);decibel;rayleigh fading;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;stationary process;wireless access point;x.690	Haci Ilhan;Ibrahim Altunbas;Murat Uysal	2008	VTC Spring 2008 - IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2008.135	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;base station;diversity scheme;cooperative diversity;computer network;diversity gain	Mobile	29.967646807380817	82.97907114011564	30594

Both of them only require local channel state information and no symbol extension is needed. Then, Ning showed that when only one stream of information symbols is sent by each user, interference alignment may achieve receive diversity using the max-SINR algorithm. This result was, however, derived only based on an assumption. In this paper, using a different approach, we prove that interference alignment using the max-SINR algorithm indeed achieves receive diversity without the assumption used by Ning The result in this paper not only completes the proof of the result by Ning , but also generalizes it by allowing more than one stream of information symbols to be sent by each user.	algorithm;channel state information;interference (communication);maximal set;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;statistical interference;zero-forcing precoding	Tianyi Xu;Xiang-Gen Xia	2014	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2013.2294830	telecommunications;zero-forcing precoding;mathematics;cooperative diversity	Comp.	35.80639823531327	74.07122029762624	30614

First, we simulate the radar systems with realistic operational parameters. Furthermore, we leverage a detailed 3GPP-compliant LTE simulation with a sophisticated air interface modeling and investigate sensitivity of LTE to radar interference in macro cell, outdoor small cell, and indoor small cell scenarios. We simulate the propagation conditions between the radar and LTE system by adopting the Free Space Path Loss and Irregular Terrain Model commonly leveraged by National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), to account for propagation, diffraction, and troposcatter losses that the radar pulses undergo before they reach the LTE system. As a performance metric, we evaluate the throughput of the LTE system in the uplink direction for various distances between the radar and the cellular system. Our simulation results indicate an LTE link will remain operational even in severe interference conditions. In fact, the LTE system as close as 100 km away from the radar undergoes less than 10 % throughput loss from the LTE total throughput, and the throughput loss is less than 30 % when the radar is only 50 km away from the LTE.	compaq lte;interference (communication);radar	Mo Ghorbanzadeh;Eugene Visotsky;Prakash Moorut;T.

c3e24046ba197a55301d6fece6e41c78ba5096ce	designing joint precoding and beamforming in a multiple gateway multibeam satellite system		This paper aims to design joint on-ground precoding and on-board beamforming of a multiple gateway multibeam satellite system in a hybrid space-ground mode where full frequency reuse pattern is considered among the beams. In such an architecture, each gateway serves a cluster of adjacent beams such that the adjacent clusters are served through a set of gateways that are located at different geographical areas. However, such a system brings in two challenges to overcome. First, the inter-beam interference is the bottleneck of the whole system and applying interference mitigation techniques becomes necessary. Second, as the data demand increases, the ground and space segments should employ extensive bandwidth resources in the feeder link accordingly. This entails embedding an extra number of gateways aiming to support a fair balance between the increasing demand and the corresponding required feeder link resources. To solve these problems, this study investigates the impact of employing a joint multiple gateway architecture and onboard beamforming scheme. It is shown that by properly designing the on-board beamforming scheme, the number of gateways can be kept affordable even if the data demand increases. Moreover, Zero Forcing (ZF) precoding technique is considered to cope with the inter-beam interference where each gateway constructs a part of block ZF precoding matrix. The conceived designs are evaluated with a close-to-real beam pattern and the latest broadband communication standard for satellite communications.	beamforming;communications satellite;computation;gw-basic;gateway (telecommunications);interference (communication);on-board data handling;radiation pattern;star wars episode i:;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding	Vahid Joroughi;Bhavani Shankar;Sina Maleki;Symeon Chatzinotas;Joel Grotz;Björn E.

However, the existing of ISI in FTN signaling system makes its carrier frequency-offset (CFO) estimation more complex and traditional algorithms may not work effectively. To fill this gap, we propose an iterative CFO estimation scheme for FTN signaling system. The scheme is composed of two parts, estimating the value of CFO roughly by discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and then finishing the accurate estimation by the improved iterative algorithm. Simulation results show that, in FTN transmission, as signal noise ratio raises, the proposed scheme makes the mean square error (MSE) of estimation value approach the Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB), which means getting better detection performance than the conventional ones designed for orthogonal transmission.	algorithm;carrier frequency offset;discrete fourier transform;discrete-time fourier transform;information sciences institute;interference (communication);iterative method;mean squared error;noise (electronics);scheme;signalling system no. 7;simulation	Jiancun Fan;Yajie Ren;Xinmin Luo	2017	2017 20th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications (WPMC)	10.1109/WPMC.2017.8301798	real-time computing;iterative method;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;control theory;integrated circuit;interference (wave propagation);carrier frequency offset;discrete fourier transform;computer science;mean squared error;signal-to-noise ratio	Metrics	50.6317523675996	78.75233851941282	30719
1af0df0f01288d28751bda7fab256a6f4e0b0727	opportunistic relaying for low-altitude uav swarm secure communications with multiple eavesdroppers		In this study, we investigate the secrecy outage performance achieved by opportunistic relaying for a low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm secure communication system in the presence of multiple UAV-eavesdroppers. In the primary channel, multiple UAV-transmitters are connected to a ground station via the ground-to-air (G2A) wireless backhaul and a UAV-transmitter and UAV-relay are selected to transmit the source signal to a far ground destination under air-to-air and air-to-ground Nakagami-m fading links. In the eavesdropping channel, maximum ratio combining is applied across multiple UAV-eavesdroppers for intercepting the legitimate transmissions from both the selected UAV-transmitter and UAV-relay. The backhaul reliability and eavesdropping probability are introduced to reflect the practical constraints on the G2A wireless backhaul and UAV-eavesdropper cooperation, respectively. The closed-form expression for the secrecy outage probability is derived in terms of the UAV cooperation, backhaul reliability, eavesdropping probability, and Nakagami-m fading parameters. In the high signal-to-noise ratio region, the asymptotic secrecy outage probability is also derived. It is shown that the secrecy diversity gain achieved by opportunistic relaying is jointly determined by the UAV cooperation and shape factors of Nakagami-m fading links in the primary channel. The analytical secrecy outage metrics achieved by opportunistic relaying are verified by Monte Carlo simulation results.	aerial photography;backhaul (telecommunications);downtime;monte carlo method;primary channel;relay;secure communication;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;sun outage;swarm;transmitter;unmanned aerial vehicle	Hongwu Liu;Sang-Jo Yoo;Kyung Sup Kwak	2018	Journal of Communications and Networks	10.1109/JCN.2018.000074	computer science;computer network;primary channel;fading;backhaul (telecommunications);nakagami distribution;diversity gain;secure communication;maximal-ratio combining;communication channel	Mobile	35.154658123975565	81.82786372232862	30731

In the context of RF wireless communications, Γ Γ distribution accurately models the power statistics in composite shadowing/fading channels as well as in cascade multipath fading channels, while in optical wireless (OW) systems, it describes the fluctuations of the irradiance of optical signals distorted by atmospheric turbulence. Although Γ Γ channel model offers analytical tractability in the analysis of single input single output (SISO) wireless systems, difficulties arise when studying multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems, where the distribution of the sum of independent Γ Γ variates is required. In this paper, we present a novel and simple closed-form approximation for the distribution of the sum of independent, but not necessarily identically distributed Γ Γ variates. It is shown that the probability density function (PDF) of the Γ Γ sum can be efficiently approximated either by the PDF of a single Γ Γ distribution, or by a finite weighted sum of PDFs of Γ Γ distributions. To reveal the importance of the proposed approximation, the performance of RF wireless systems in the presence of composite fading, as well as MIMO OW systems impaired by atmospheric turbulence, are investigated. Numerical results and simulations illustrate the accuracy of the proposed approach.	approximation algorithm;channel (communications);mimo;multipath propagation;numerical linear algebra;optical wireless;portable document format;radio frequency;simulation;soft-in soft-out decoder;turbulence;weight function	Nestor D.

We devise an advanced vehicular relaying technique for enhanced connectivity in densely populated urban areas. We investigate the performance of a transmission scheme over a Long-Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) network where vehicles act as relaying cooperating terminals for a downlink session between a base station and an end-user. The abundance of moving vehicles, operating in an ad hoc fashion, can eliminate the need for establishing a dedicated relaying infrastructure. However, the associated wireless links in vehicular clouds are characterized by a doubly selective fading channel; this causes performance degradation in terms of increased error probability. Hence, we propose a precoded cooperative transmission technique to extract the underlying rich multipath-Doppler-spatial diversity, which is a relay selection scheme to take advantage of the potentially large number of available relaying vehicles. We further contribute by the derivation of a closed-form error rate expression, diversity gain, and outage expressions and introduce our derived performance unconditional expressions as a benchmark to assess our analysis and future research studies of such an approach. Our analytical and simulation results indicate that significant diversity gains and reduced error rates are achievable. In addition, there is a noticeable reduction in the required transmitting power compared with traditional transmission schemes, as well as an increase in distance coverage.	benchmark (computing);compaq lte;downtime;elegant degradation;hoc (programming language);multi-user mimo;multipath propagation;population;relay;simulation;telecommunications link;transmitter	Mohamed Fathy Feteiha;Hossam S.

The scheme provides an efficient way to deal with filters with large number of elements. It consists of a bank of full-rank adaptive filters that forms a transformation matrix and an adaptive reduced-rank filter that operates at the output of the bank of filters. The transformation matrix projects the received vector onto a low-dimension vector, which is processed by the reduced-rank filter to estimate the desired signal. The expressions of the transformation matrix and the reduced-rank weight vector are derived according to the constrained constant modulus (CCM) criterion subject to different constraints. Two low-complexity adaptive algorithms are devised for the implementation of the proposed scheme with different constraints. Simulations are performed to show superior performance of the proposed algorithms in comparison with the existing methods.	adaptive algorithm;adaptive filter;beamforming;computer simulation;iterative method;mathematical optimization;median filter;modulus of continuity;transformation matrix	Lei Wang;Rodrigo C. de Lamare	2009	2009 IEEE/SP 15th Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing		adaptive filter;mathematical optimization;computer science;control theory;mathematics	HPC	53.64941167631232	76.08893357154274	30827

We show that its weights depend on non-local CSI (NLCSI), thereby hampering its implementation in a distributed fashion. Exploiting the polychromatic (i.e., multi-ray) structure of scattered channels, we propose a novel distributed CB (DCB) design whose weights depends solely on local CSI (LCSI) and prove that it performs nearly as well as its NLCSI-based counterpart. Furthermore, we prove that the proposed LCSI-based DCB outperforms two other distributed-implementation benchmarks: the monochromatic (i.e., single-ray) DCB (M-DCB) whose design ignores the presence of scattering and the bichromatic (i.e., two-ray) DCB (B-DCB), which relies on an efficient polychromatic-channel approximation by two rays when the angular spread is relatively small.	angularjs;approximation;beamforming;camera serial interface;monochrome;overhead (computing);signal-to-noise ratio	Slim Zaidi;Bouthaina Hmidet;Sofiène Affes	2015	IEEE Wireless Communications Letters	10.1109/LWC.2015.2435737	telecommunications;computer science;distribution function;graphical model;scattering;signal-to-noise ratio	DB	43.82915242767149	87.85078607468125	30836

Analytical bounds and simulation results on synchronization probability show that the high SNR ML rule has a performance approaching that of the optimum ML rule over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios.

MIMO cognitive radio is a kind of cognitive radios using MIMO beamforming techniques to avoid interference to other nodes. There are many theoretical works on this topic but validation of the algorithm on real hardware has not been realized. Most of these works assume perfect CSI though it is always obtained with errors in practice, especially CSIT. It is known that MIMO beamforming techniques are sensitive to CSI errors and their performance might severely be degraded in practice. Despite the fact that cognitive radio with MIMO beamforming techniques is powerful in terms of spatial efficiency as shown by theoretical results, the feasibility of such systems in real environment have never been studied before. Therefore, we attempt to provide the first implementation of a MIMO cognitive radio system using Tx/Rx beamforming and prove the feasibility by measuring its throughput performance. In this paper, we will explain our implementation and measurement results. In the measurement, we measure achievable throughput of both primary and secondary system. As a result, we found that this system works effectively when transmit power of primary nodes is large enough while that of the secondary nodes is relatively small.	algorithm;beamforming;cognitive radio;interference (communication);mimo;modulation;rx microcontroller family;throughput	Ryosuke Iwata;Vutha Va;Kei Sakaguchi;Kiyomichi Araki	2013	2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666637	3g mimo;cognitive radio;multi-user mimo;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;spatial multiplexing;computer network;mimo	Mobile	41.79333943792246	85.95002410838373	31066

Achievability is based on the idea of interference alignment (IA). However, with the presence of imperfect CSI, the sum rate becomes degraded and full DoF may not be achievable anymore. In this paper and by considering a generalized CSI mismatch model, we propose a novel MMSE-based IA scheme such that the unitary beamformers are adaptively designed to achieve better performance when only imperfect CSI is available. We then compare the performance of the proposed scheme with maximum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (Max-SINR) algorithm. We show that while under perfect CSI the proposed algorithm achieves the same performance as Max-SINR, the former outperforms the latter under CSI mismatch. Meanwhile, it is shown that the proposed algorithm needs less CSI to be available and has less computational complexity compared to Max-SINR.	algorithm;beamforming;csi-dos;channel state information;computation;computational complexity theory;interference (communication);mimo-ofdm;multi-user mimo;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio	Seyed Morteza Razavi;Tharmalingam Ratnarajah	2014	2014 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7037391	algorithm design;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics;interference;signal-to-noise ratio;wireless;statistics;mimo	Mobile	39.89284041383608	86.23936849316179	31145

The conventional DFT-based channel estimation methods improve the performance by neglecting nonsignificant channel taps. However, the error floor occurs at high signal-to-noise when useful channel information is discarded, especially in non-sample-spaced channel. To solve this problem, we propose a modified DFT-based channel estimation method. Based on the noise power estimated in the frequency domain, which does not suffer from the energy leakage of channel path, we design the threshold for detecting the significant channel taps. Moreover, a wider region with fixed width is designed to decrease the energy loss of channel. Simulation results show that the proposed method is robust to the distribution of channel paths, and the error floor is eliminated.	channel state information	Feng Shi;Dengpeng Hu;Eryang Zhang;Chen Wang	2010		10.1109/WCSP.2010.5633515	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;precoding;channel capacity	EDA	49.00012034630885	80.6640365094704	31164

We consider doubling the transmission data rate of the IEEE 802.11a system by using two transmit and two receive antennas. We propose a preamble design for this multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system that is backward compatible with its single-input single-output (SISO) counterpart as specified by the IEEE 802.11a standard. Based on this preamble design, we devise a sequential method for the estimation of the carrier frequency offset (CFO), symbol timing, and MIMO channel response. We also provide a simple soft detector based on the unstructured least square approach to obtain the soft information for the Viterbi decoder. This soft detector is very simple since it decouples the multidimensional QAM symbol detection into multiple one-dimensional QAM symbol—and further PAM symbol—detections. Both the sequential parameter estimation method and the soft detector can provide excellent overall system performance and are ideally suited for real-time implementations. The effectiveness of our methods is demonstrated via numerical examples.	backward compatibility;carrier frequency offset;data rate units;estimation theory;frequency divider;mimo;multiplexing;newton's method;numerical analysis;numerical method;period-doubling bifurcation;real-time clock;sensor;soft-in soft-out decoder;viterbi decoder	Jianhua Liu	2004	EURASIP J.

The proposed scheme considers relay selection via the available partial channel state information (CSI) at the source and the relays. In particular, we discuss the multi-node decode-and-forward cooperative scenarios, where arbitrary N relays are available. The source determines when it needs to cooperate with one relay only, and which relay to cooperate with in case of cooperation, i.e., """"When to cooperate?"""" and """"Whom to cooperate with?"""". An optimal relay is the one which has the maximum instantaneous scaled harmonic mean functionof its source-relay and relay-destination channel gains. For the symmetric scenario, we derive an approximate expression of the bandwidth efficiency and obtain an upper bound on the symbol error rate (SER) performance. We show that full diversity is guaranteed and that a significant increase of the bandwidth efficiency is achieved. Moreover, we present the tradeoff between the achievable bandwidth efficiency and the corresponding SER.

The small carrier wavelengths at mmwave frequencies enable synthesis of compact antenna arrays, providing beamforming gains that compensate the increased propagation losses. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of employing multiple antenna arrays (at the transmitter and/or receiver) to obtain diversity/multiplexing gains in mmwave systems, where each of the arrays is capable of beamforming independently. Considering a codebook-based beamforming system (the set of possible beamforming directions is fixed a priori, e.g., to facilitate limited feedback), we observe that the complexity of jointly optimizing the beamforming directions across the multiple arrays is highly prohibitive, even for very reasonable system parameters. To overcome this bottleneck, we develop reduced complexity algorithms for optimizing the choice of beamforming directions, premised on the sparse multipath structure of the mmwave channel. Specifically, we reduce the cardinality of the joint beamforming search space, by restricting attention to a small set of dominant candidate directions. To obtain the set of dominant directions, we develop two complementary approaches: 1) based on computation of a novel spatial power metric; a detailed analysis of this metric shows that, in the limit of large antenna arrays, the selected candidate directions approach the channel's dominant angles of arrival and departure, and 2) precise estimation of the channel's (long-term) dominant angles of arrival, exploiting the correlations of the signals received across the different receiver subarrays. Our methods enable a drastic reduction of the optimization search space (a factor of 100 reduction), while delivering close to optimal performance, thereby indicating the potential feasibility of achieving diversity and multiplexing gains in mmwave systems.	algorithm;beamforming;codebook;computation;mimo;mathematical optimization;multipath propagation;multiplexing;software propagation;sparse matrix;spectral density;transmitter	Jaspreet Singh;Sudhir Ramakrishna	2015	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2015.2390637	database index;telecommunications;computer science;smart antenna;radio frequency	Mobile	42.99143995313326	85.77775100017645	31238

Time-varying characteristics of the channels also causes unavoidable inter-carrier interferences, which make both channel estimation and symbol detection doubly difficult. Considered in this paper is a power allocation between pilot symbols and data to maximize the sum symbol rate. The average channel complex gains are estimated and are used to obtain the basis expansion model (BEM) of the HST, upon which the data detection is based.

Turbo codes are one of the most powerful types of error control codes currently available. There is a tradeoff in turbo codes between latency and BER which depends on the choice of interleaver size, number of decoding iterations and the algorithm used in the decoding process. In this paper we propose a reduced-complexity OFDM receiver with joint iterative channel estimation and iterative decoding employing turbo coding. Improved performance of this receiver is observed in comparison with others current channel estimation and decoding techniques.	algorithm;channel state information;error detection and correction;forward error correction;iteration;turbo code;x.690	Marta Perez Portugal;Yeheskel Bar-Ness	2005	2005 13th European Signal Processing Conference		list decoding;concatenated error correction code;turbo equalizer;turbo code;electronic engineering;low-density parity-check code;telecommunications;sequential decoding;theoretical computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;bcjr algorithm;linear code;berlekamp–welch algorithm;error floor	EDA	43.889555898142575	67.50608581647253	31253

To allow pervasive use of these techniques in resources constrained systems, it is important to limit their implementation complexity, without sacrificing the superior performance they are known for. We show that introducing traceback information into the MAP algorithm, thereby leveraging components that are also part of Soft-Output Viterbi Algorithms (SOVA), offers two unique possibilities to simplify the computational requirements. Our proposed enhancements are effective at each individual decoding iteration and therefore provide gains on top of existing techniques such as early termination and memory optimizations. Based on these enhancements, we will present three new architectural variants for the decoder. Each one of these may be preferable depending on the decoder memory hardware requirements and number of trellis states. Computational complexity is reduced significantly, without incurring significant performance penalty.	algorithm	Curt Schurgers;Anantha Chandrakasan	2008	Signal Processing Systems	10.1007/s11265-007-0160-8	turbo code;soft output viterbi algorithm;parallel computing;real-time computing;error detection and correction;soft-decision decoder;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;very-large-scale integration;computational complexity theory;algorithm;statistics	ML	44.62033762037434	64.07609105080233	31318

When the relevant side information is a subspace, the feedback scheme can be viewed as a lossy source compression scheme on the Grassmannian manifold. Memoryless vector quantization on each fading block is a viable compression scheme, but it neglects any temporal correlation between the blocks. In this paper, we propose an incremental approach to Grassmannian quantization that takes advantage of temporal correlation. The approach leverages existing codebooks for memoryless quantization schemes and employs a quantized form of geodesic interpolation. Two schemes that implement the principles of the proposed approach are presented. In the first scheme, the choice of the step size in the incremental update is adapted to a first-order GaussMarkov model for the channel, which enables the use of higher resolution codebooks. In the second scheme, a single bit is allocated to the step size, which enables adaptation of the step size to the channel realization rather than the channel statistics. This provides substantial robustness against mismatches in the model for the temporal correlation. A distinguishing feature of the proposed approach is that the direction of the geodesic interpolation is specified implicitly using a point in a conventional codebook. As a result, the approach has an inherent ability to recover autonomously from errors in the feedback path. Simulation results demonstrate that these features result in improved performance over some existing schemes in a variety of channel environments.	approximation algorithm;channel (communications);code word;codebook;coefficient;direction finding;first-order predicate;image resolution;incremental backup;interpolation;lossy compression;markov chain;matrix multiplication;multi-user mimo;multidimensional digital pre-distortion;numerical analysis;online and offline;rewrite (programming);scheme;simulation;singular value decomposition;social inequality;steady state;the matrix;transmitter;trust region;vector quantization;voronoi diagram	Ahmed Medra;Timothy N.

MSDC utilizes a multibeam transmitter and a composite receiver consisting of 7 narrow field-of-view (FOV) branches. Numerical evaluation is performed for two values of the receiver FOV corresponding to the cases when at least one or two diffusing spots are covered by a branch. Required optical power is used as a measure for MSDC link evaluation. The composite receiver provides angle diversity, which allows implementation of effective combining techniques. Selection Combining (SC) and Maximal Ratio Containing (MRC) methods have been analyzed. Our simulation results show that MSDC can reach much higher bit rates than a diffuse link can, without any channel equalization. MSDC link employing angle diversity receiver with larger FOV (each receiver branch capturing at least two diffusing spots) and using MRC method shows a promising performance for up to several hundreds of Mbps. System robustness against shadowing and blockage is also investigated. MSDC is more robust when an obstacle is located near the receiver, while this may cause severe problems in a diffuse link.	data rate units;file shadowing;loran-c;msdc;maximal set;secure digital container;simulation;transmitter	Wuncheol Jeong;Mohsen Kavehrad;Svetla Jivkova	2001	IJWIN	10.1023/A:1011381528988	infrared;field of view;telecommunications;equalization	Mobile	26.404027418003448	81.8513286849075	31378
8239501ad851d0283a55a52569ae47d89786377f	map channel estimation with turbo processing for orthogonal space–time block coded miso systems		Abstract#R##N##R##N#In this paper, we investigate fast time-varying channel estimation for two orthogonal space–time block-coded systems with either two or three transmit antennas and with one receive antenna. We propose an iterative expectation–maximisation-based maximum a posteriori (MAP) semi-blind algorithm for the estimation of the discrete propagation channels seen from the transmit antennas. This algorithm requires a convenient representation of the channel using a discrete version of the Karhunen-Loeve expansion theorem. It incorporates the coded structure of each block in a turbo-processing fashion and uses the MAP training-based channel estimation algorithm for its optimum initialisation. The transmit antennas are assumed to be spatially correlated for the system with two transmit antennas and spatially uncorrelated for the three-antenna system. The validity of the proposed algorithm is highlighted by simulation results. The performance of the proposed receivers, based on MAP channel estimation, for the two systems approaches that of the perfect channel state information receiver, even for very time selective fading channels.

0e98c1a7812cc5cd44a96aa7c56ad080ea6cc628	the impact on full duplex d2d communication of different lte transmission techniques		To augment capacity of spectrum limited cellular systems, 3GPP proposed Licensed Assisted Access (LAA-LTE) while efforts are underway to standardize the standalone MulteFire (a small cell standalone version of LTE). LAA is expected to boost capacity of LTE via unlicensed spectrum (5GHz). On the other hand, recent advances in Self Interference Suppression (SIS) techniques allow radios to transmit and receive simultaneously on the same channel (i.e., in-band Full-Duplex, FD). As part of future wireless networks, Device-to-device (D2D) communications would find its great potential through this FD capability. However, due to high induced aggregate interference from FD and its impact on medium access probability, the rigorous and critical analysis is needed to find an optimum trade-off between performance efficiency and overheads. Using stochastic geometry and the random graph theory, in this article, we analyze the impact of different LTE network paradigms with HD/FD D2D devices. Moreover, the impact of state- of-the-art coexistence techniques (discontinuous transmission and listen-before-talk) recommended for LTE in unlicensed spectrum over HD/FD D2D network is also discussed. The analysis is supported with extensive simulation results that reveal insights of the coexistence mechanism efficiency employed by LTE, the impact of SIS and the cost of FD operation in D2D.	aggregate data;coexist (image);compaq lte;discontinuous transmission;duplex (telecommunications);graph theory;interference (communication);numerical analysis;rado graph;random graph;simulation;statistical interference;zero suppression	Noman Haider;Eryk Dutkiewicz;Diep N.

2225f0a5746dff3d4bec9605867e0254d65efe4c	a study of peak to average power ratio for different companding techniques in vlc-ofdm system		VLC-OFDM is proposed to be used as the transmission technique in 5G mobile communication. VLC-OFDM produces the non-linear distortion due to non linear characteristics of LEDs and the PAPR of multiple sub-carrier modulation. The mitigation of non-linear distortion in VLC system is presently focused by many researchers, as it degrades system performance. Since the technique used in VLC system is OFDM so the system suffers the drawbacks of OFDM as well as VLC. Therefore, the non-linearity in the VLC-OFDM is quite severe. Hence, three companding techniques(A-law, μ-law, advanced A-law) can be implemented to remove the PAPR issue. Comparatively, advance A-law provides lower PAP ratio. This paper proposes these three non-linear companding techniques for reducing PAPR in VLC-OFDM system.	companding;data compression;distortion;modulation;nonlinear system;password authentication protocol;power architecture platform reference;subcarrier;vlc media player;x.690	Arushi Singh;Anjana Jain;Prakash D.

95f2aa6c9900516433ad0b5e865e5d9751f7c542	hybrid precoder design for millimeter wave systems based on geometric construction		Large-scale antenna arrays which provide high beamforming gain are commonly used to combat the serious path-loss in millimeter wave (mmwave) systems. Traditionally, the beamforming is completely implemented at the baseband or the digital domain, which, however, causes high hardware cost and power consumption. The hybrid precoding method which can effectively avoids these problems is, therefore, more attractive. However, the design of hybrid precoder is challenging due to the constant modules of phase shifters. To solve this problem, we propose a novel hybrid precoding approach from the perspective of geometric construction in this paper. The new method can significantly reduce the number of RF chains meanwhile still achieve an almost optimal performance in terms of sum rate. The proposed algorithm is compared with the popular orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm (OMP) via numerical simulations, and shows that our proposal can increase the system spectral efficiency with reduced computational complexity.	algorithm;baseband;beamforming;computation;computational complexity theory;hybrid drive;markov chain;matching pursuit;multi-user;numerical analysis;openmp;rf modulator;radio frequency;simulation;spectral efficiency	Minhua Su;Yongming Huang;Cheng Zhang;Jianjun Zhang;Yuanjie Li	2017	GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254858	real-time computing;matching pursuit;algorithm design;radio frequency;computer science;beamforming;precoding;computational complexity theory;electronic engineering;spectral efficiency;baseband	EDA	43.59537744252336	86.60796902314421	31580

The I/Q imbalance incurs unwanted image interference on top of the desired signal and can severely degrade system performance if left uncompensated. In this paper, a training-based approach is proposed to estimate and compensate for the I/Q imbalance in the SC-FDE system. First, we derive the likelihood function capturing the I/Q imbalance and multipath channel. By iteratively maximizing the likelihood function, we can simultaneously and separately estimate the I/Q imbalance and the multipath channel. Then, with the estimate of the I/Q imbalance, the corresponding image interference is removed by simple substitution. Finally, we use the channel estimate to conduct equalization in the frequency domain, as is done in the conventional SC-FDE without the I/Q imbalance. It is shown through simulations compliant with the IEEE 802.11ad Standard that the proposed approach can effectively mitigate the adverse effect of I/Q imbalance and, consequently, can achieve the performance very close to the ideal case without I/Q imbalance.	adobe framemaker;analog front-end;carrier frequency;interference (communication);multipath propagation;simulation	Xiantao Cheng;Zengqiang Luo;Shaoqian Li	2016	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2015.2485278	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;mathematics;iterative method;radio receiver;radio frequency;frequency domain	Mobile	51.37162240473524	79.20801713165137	31596

For the multicarrier transmission, the differential orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems with diversity reception are discussed. It is well known that there are two types of differential OFDM systems, namely, the time domain differential OFDM (TD-OFDM) and the frequency domain differential OFDM (FD-OFDM). In this paper, the NSD and its special cases are incorporated to the differential OFDM systems. Furthermore, we provide a simple closed-form bit-error-rate (BER) expression for the differential OFDM systems utilizing the noncoherent one-shot detector with diversity reception in the time-varying multipath Rayleigh fading channels. Numerical results have revealed that, with multi-antenna diversity reception, the performance of the noncoherent one-shot detector is improved significantly. However, when only one or two receive antennas are available, the implementation of the linearly predictive DF detector or the linearly predictive Viterbi receiver is necessary for achieving better and satisfactory performance.	bit error rate;differential phase;direction finding;finite-state machine;frequency divider;key (cryptography);modulation;multipath propagation;multiplexing;rayleigh fading;x.690	Ding-Bing Lin;Ping-Hung Chiang;Hsueh-Jyh Li	2006	IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting	10.1109/TBC.2005.857604	computer simulation;electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;statistics	Visualization	43.03056480888167	75.1429137125731	31665

09b4c01a42ef31ccdfc95cb90a6709cfd48a779f	spectral efficiency analysis for downlink noma aided spatial modulation with finite alphabet inputs		As the conventional spatial modulation (SM) system lacks an efficient downlink multiple access scheme, this paper proposes a novel downlink nonorthogonal multiple access aided multiple-input multiple-output SM system with finite alphabet inputs. Mutual information (MI) is used to characterize the system's achievable spectral efficiency (SE). Because the MI lacks a closed-form formulation, in this paper we propose a computational-efficient lower bound to provide an approximation to the simulated MI. Besides, preprocessing is also designed at the receiver to mitigate the detrimental effect of channel correlation, which leads to striking a higher SE performance. Simulation results not only confirm the accuracy of our SE analysis, but also substantiate the superior SE performance achieved by the proposed preprocessing.	approximation;mimo;modulation;mutual information;preprocessor;simulation;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link	Xuesi Wang;Jintao Wang;Longzhuang He;Jian Song	2017	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2017.2737327	modulation;electronic engineering;mimo;telecommunications link;mutual information;alphabet;upper and lower bounds;computer science;spectral efficiency;communication channel	Mobile	43.987307633651355	78.15924048916999	31706

In this paper, to provide a bandwidth-efficient solution for MIMO-OFDM channel estimation, we establish conditions for channel identifiability and present a blind channel estimation technique based on a subspace approach. The proposed method unifies and generalizes the existing subspace-based methods for blind channel estimation in single-input single-output OFDM systems to blind channel estimation for two different MIMO-OFDM systems distinguished according to the number of transmit and receive antennas. In particular, the proposed method obtains accurate channel estimation and fast convergence with insensitivity to overestimates of the true channel order. If virtual carriers (VCs) are available, the proposed method can work with no or insufficient cyclic prefix (CP), thereby potentially increasing channel utilization. Furthermore, it is shown under specific system conditions that the proposed method can be applied to MIMO-OFDM systems without CPs, regardless of the presence of VCs, and obtains an accurate channel estimate with a small number of OFDM symbols. Thus, this method improves the transmission bandwidth efficiency.

In contrast to conventional cellular systems featuring orthogonal information flows served by decoupled channel resources via, e.g., time division, we propose a novel protocol in which two information flows are served simultaneously via the shared channel resource, thus constituting a spectral-efficient solution for cellular communications. On the other hand, however, an inevitable issue associated with the proposed protocol is the interflow interference, which may lead to serious deterioration on both information flows. To tackle this issue, we develop an overhearing-based protocol that utilizes the overheard interference as useful side information in the receiver design. Specifically, depending on the interference levels, an adaptive linear minimum mean squared error (MMSE) and nonlinear MMSE successive interference cancellation (SIC) receiver exploiting the overheard interference at the direct mobile terminal is developed. To balance between the two information flows, we develop the asymptotically optimum superposition coding at the base station (BS) in the high-power regime. Furthermore, the optimum relay beamforming matrix maximizing the bottleneck of the achievable rates of the two information flows is developed subject to a finite power constraint. Finally, simulations demonstrate a remarkable throughput gain over the conventional cellular systems.	beamforming;bell laboratories layered space-time;catastrophic interference;coexist (image);hop;interference (communication);mean squared error;mobile phone;nonlinear system;relay;simplified instructional computer;simulation;throughput	Chunguo Li;Peng Liu;Chao Zou;Fan Sun;John M.

However, rate-1 orthogonal codes for complex constellations have not been found for more than two transmit antennas. By using a genetic algorithm, rate-1 space-time block codes that accommodate very simple receiver processing at the cost of reduced diversity are designed in this paper for more than two transmit antennas. Simulation results show that evolved codes combined with efficient outer codes provide better performance over fading channels than minimum-decoding-complexity quasiorthogonal codes at typical operating signal-to-noise ratios. When the fading is more severe than Rayleigh fading, the spectral efficiency is specified, and an efficient outer code is used, evolved codes outperform orthogonal space-time block codes.	authorization;concatenated error correction code;emoticon;genetic algorithm;ieee xplore;like button;rayleigh fading;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectral efficiency	Don J.

Although the SNR PFS scheme only requires little feedback overhead and low computational complexity, the performance of the SNR PFS scheme is nearly the same as the conventional scheme (i.e., codebook-based PFS scheme). However, with the increasing number of users, a large number of CQI feedbacks will increase the signaling burden. To overcome this obstacle, the proposed SNR PFS scheme with threshold which sets an appropriate feedback threshold to limit the CQI feedbacks with poor channel quality would hardly affect the performance of the scheme. We further derive the approximate rate expressions of the SNR PFS scheme by using probability statistics and the theory of order statistics, whose result is nearly approximated to that of the Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, our simulation results show that the performance of the SNR PFS scheme with βth = ln(K/5) is close to that of the SNR PFS scheme, while it has less limited feedback capacity than the SNR PFS scheme.	approximation algorithm;beamforming;channel state information;codebook;computational complexity theory;fair-share scheduling;feedback;forward secrecy;monte carlo method;overhead (computing);proportionally fair;scsi;scheduling (computing);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;telecommunications link	Qiang Sun;Yuan Zhang;Shi Jin;Xiqi Gao	2013	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-012-0746-8	real-time computing;telecommunications;mathematics	Mobile	39.42193965155569	83.76495391327425	31846

This problem has direct applications in the storage of ordinal data or rankings, and in the analysis of sorting algorithms. We analyze the rate-distortion characteristic for the permutation space under the uniform distribution, and the minimum achievable rate of compression that allows a bounded distortion after recovery. Our analysis is with respect to different practical and useful distortion measures, including Kendall tau distance, Spearman's footrule, Chebyshev distance, and inversion-ℓ1 distance. We establish equivalence of source code designs under certain distortions and show simple explicit code designs that incur low encoding/decoding complexities and are asymptotically optimal. Finally, we show that for the Mallows model, a popular nonuniform ranking model on the permutation space, both the entropy and the maximum distortion at zero rate are much lower than the uniform counterparts, which motivates the future design of efficient compression schemes for this model.	asymptotically optimal algorithm;data compression;distortion;kendall tau distance;lossy compression;ordinal data;sorting algorithm;turing completeness	Da Wang;Arya Mazumdar;Gregory W.

Such a model does not accurately reflect the statistics of co-channel interference, a dominant source of signal disturbance that limits the capacity of most cellular networks. Consequently, the performance of receivers designed based on the Gaussian model is often far from optimum in a heavily loaded network. In this paper, we explore the potential of suppressing interference in channel estimation by using a non-Gaussian noise model of the signal disturbance. An EM-based, iterative algorithm is derived for jointly estimating the channel response and the parameters that characterize the non-Gaussian noise model. As an example, we also consider a special case where the non-Gaussian model has a constant envelope characteristic. Using the GSM/EDGE air interface, we demonstrate that significant performance gains can be obtained with the proposed channel estimation algorithm when a dominant GMSK-modulated interference exists. The proposed algorithm can also be used in combination with equalizers designed for non-Gaussian noise models to provide further performance gains.

According to the link quality, the proposed scheme changes the constellation size as well as the priority parameters of the hierarchical signal constellations and assigns available subchannels (i.e., different bit positions) to different kinds of bits. Specifically, for very bad channel conditions, it only transmits voice with binary phase-shift keying (BPSK). As the channel condition improves, a variable-rate adaptive hierarchical M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM) is used to increase the data throughput. The voice bits are always transmitted in the lowest priority subchannel (i.e., the least significant bit (LSB) position) of the quadrature (Q) channel of the hierarchical M-QAM. The remaining (log2M-1) subchannels, called data subchannels, are assigned to two different classes of data according to the selected priority parameters. Closed-form expressions as well as numerical results for outage probability, achievable spectral efficiency, and average bit error rate (BER) for voice and data transmission over Nakagami-m fading channels are presented. The adaptive techniques employing hybrid binary shift keying (BPSK)/M-ary AM (M-AM) and uniform M-QAM for simultaneous voice and two different classes of data transmission are also extended. Compared to the extended schemes, the new proposed scheme is spectrally more efficient for data transmission, while keeping the same outage probability for voice and data (both classes) as the scheme employing BPSK/M-AM. The new scheme also provides, as a by-product, a spectrally efficient way of transmitting voice and a single-class data	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;bit error rate;bitwise operation;digital subchannel;downtime;exptime;fairness measure;key (cryptography);least significant bit;modulation;most significant bit;numerical analysis;principle of good enough;regular expression;spectral efficiency;sun outage;throughput;transmitter;weight function;x.690	Md.

The proposed system allocates subcarriers and spreading codes to users by considering their current bandwidth requirements and frequency shifts caused by their movement. Through the use of low-correlation spreading codes in close subcarriers the scheme reduces the inter-carrier interference generated by high-speed users while keeping the inter-symbol interference at a low level due to the multicarrier transmission. The analysis and results show that a substantial mitigation of both the intercarrier interference and bit error ratio, without reducing the system bandwidth efficiency, can be achieved. That makes our proposed method a god candidate for future broadband highly-mobile networks.	multi-user	Luis Loyola;Tetsuya Miki	2003		10.1109/PIMRC.2003.1260457	cellular network;code division multiple access;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;intersymbol interference;encoding;computer network;bandwidth allocation	Mobile	43.83397451434311	80.96940177298873	31956

To resolve the multi-objective dilemma when choosing one signal estimation for multiple receive-antenna-branches, the proposed scheme updates each quantum particle in a Pareto optimal way.

Chirp modulation is resistive to Doppler effect while its emor performance, due to the phase characteristics, is quite poor. The paper deals with a generalization of the Chirp technique leading to new classes of signal formats for digital communications with improved spectral efficiency and good error performance. To achieve this task, the second time derivative of an information carrying phase component of a modulated signal is set to be proportional to an infomation carrying data signal. Further, for a generation of specific signal formats, the alternate mark inversion encoding of data to be transmitted is applied.	chirp;doppler effect;instantaneous phase;spectral efficiency	Tadeusz A.

5edc0303fec3e5f15da1107fbbb4ce3532edbe51	dvfs based power management for ldpc decoders with early termination		Low-density parity check (LDPC) codes are a mature coding scheme in telecommunications and the low power implementation of corresponding decoders is an issue of significant importance for receivers with stringent power budgets. This paper presents a power reduction technique for LDPC decoders that further extends their energy-proportional behavior, obtained with early-termination (ET), by predicting the required number of iterations and by applying dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS). The number of expected iterations and the associated voltage/frequency settings are predicted with a novel algorithm that is based on the offline statistical analysis of the number of decoding iterations. This algorithm systematically trades the error-correcting performance up to a predefined approximation level for the achieved amount of power reduction beyond ET. Simulation and postlayout implementation results in a 28 nm FD-SOI technology prove that the proposed algorithm, when integrated with an LDPC decoder, can significantly reduce the power consumption with negligible overhead.	algorithm;approximation;binary decoder;code word;dynamic frequency scaling;dynamic voltage scaling;error detection and correction;image scaling;iteration;low-density parity-check code;online and offline;overhead (computing);parity bit;power management;simulation	Reza Ghanaatian;Andreas Peter Burg	2017	2017 IEEE International Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)	10.1109/SiPS.2017.8109981	low-density parity-check code;real-time computing;power management;parallel computing;frequency scaling;approximation algorithm;parity bit;energy consumption;computer science;decoding methods;signal-to-noise ratio	EDA	44.678307757591824	64.47528390958357	32160

This method exploits the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Cell-Averaging Constant False Alarm Rate (CA-CFAR) in an effort to maximize the probability of detection for a given probability of false alarm. First, the oversampled baseband signal is compared to its corresponding EMD noise-only model. If the band is occupied, then an EMD-CA technique is used to estimate the noise power for a given false alarm probability. Then, from the estimated noise power, double thresholds based on two given false alarm rates are calculated to detect and localize the occupied channels of band of interest. The proposed approach is able to work blindly and it is independent of the noise power. Simulations for different sampling and false alarm rates are used to validate the performance of the proposed detector. The results revealed the robustness of the proposed technique to the noise uncertainty and the capability to sense and localize multiple channels simultaneously.	baseband;cognitive radio;comparator applications;computer simulation;constant false alarm rate;hilbert–huang transform;noise power;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio	Mahdi H.

c6f2b642ea5d52584d0a232c336293f2dffc2f31	a framework for low-complexity iterative interference cancellation in communication systems	electrical engineering and computer science;thesis;technical report	Communication over interference channels poses challenges not present for the more traditional additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. In order to approach the information limits of an interference channel, interference mitigation techniques need to be integrated with channel coding and decoding techniques. This thesis develops such practical schemes when the transmitter has no knowledge of the channel. #R##N#The interference channel model we use is described by r = Hx + w, where r is the received vector, H is an interference matrix, x is the transmitted vector of data symbols chosen from a finite set, and w is a noise vector. The objective at the receiver is to detect the most likely vector x that was transmitted based on knowledge of r, H, and the statistics of w. Communication contexts in which this general integer programming problem appears include the equalization of intersymbol interference (ISI) channels, the cancellation of multiple-access interference (MAI) in code-division multiple-access (CDMA) systems, and the decoding of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems in fading environments. #R##N#We begin by introducing mode-interleaved precoding, a transmitter precoding technique that conditions an interference channel so that the pairwise error probability of any two transmit vectors becomes asymptotically equal to the pairwise error probability of the same vectors over an AWGN channel at the same signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). #R##N#While mode-interleaved precoding dramatically increases the complexity of exact ML detection, we develop iterated-decision detection to mitigate this complexity problem. Iterated-decision detectors use optimized multipass algorithms to successively cancel interference from r and generate symbol decisions whose reliability increases monotonically with each iteration. When used in uncoded systems with mode-interleaved precoding, iterated-decision detectors asymptotically achieve the performance of ML detection (and thus the interference-free lower bound) with considerably lower complexity. We interpret these detectors as low-complexity approximations to message-passing algorithms. #R##N#The integration of iterated-decision detectors into communication systems with coding is also developed to approach information rates close to theoretical limits. We present joint detection and decoding algorithms based on the iterated-decision detector with mode-interleaved precoding, and also develop analytic tools to predict the behavior of such systems. We discuss the use of binary codes for channels that support low information rates, and multilevel codes and lattice codes for channels that support higher information rates.

This result is assumed as the basement to the design of an optimised serial architecture. The logic synthesis on 0.18 μm CMOS technology shows that our design outperforms in complexity similar state-of-the-art solutions and makes the check node operations no longer critical to the complexity of the whole decoder.	cmos;logic synthesis;low-density parity-check code;simulation	Massimo Rovini;Francesco Rossi;Nicola E.

However, achievable schemes proposed to date have been shown to achieve the proved order-optimal performance only in the asymptotic regime in which the number of packets per requested item goes to infinity. In this paper, we first extend the asymptotic analysis of the achievable scheme in [1], [2] to the case of heterogeneous cache sizes and demand distributions, providing the best known upper bound on the fundamental limiting performance when the number of packets goes to infinity. We then show that the scheme achieving this upper bound quickly loses its multiplicative caching gain for finite content packetization. To overcome this limitation, we design a novel polynomial-time algorithm based on random greedy graph-coloring that, while keeping the same finite content packetization, recovers a significant part of the multiplicative caching gain. Our results show that the order-optimal coded multicasting schemes proposed to date, while useful in quantifying the fundamental limiting performance, must be properly designed for practical regimes of finite packetization.	cache (computing);content delivery network;digital distribution;downstream (software development);graph coloring;greedy algorithm;multicast;polynomial;time complexity	Giuseppe Vettigli;Mingyue Ji;Antonia Maria Tulino;Jaime Llorca;Paola Festa	2015	2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)	10.1109/INFCOMW.2015.7179393	database index;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;distributed computing;upper and lower bounds;encoding	Vision	32.10416340307387	71.171690185986	32464
daafeee4044074c44fdfa908dcbf065df2bfc45c	a new clipped pic detector for asynchronous upstream ocdma-pon		Optimization-based approaches have been used to develop several interference cancellation detectors for incoherent direct access OCDMA systems. Some of these interference cancellation detectors exploit the non-negativity of the solution, while other detectors exploit in addition to the non-negativity constraint, the noise variance information. In this paper, we devise a new PIC detector that exploits not only the aforementioned information but also the fact that the amplitude of the solution is confined to a unit hypercube. Up to our knowledge, no such detector exists in the literature. After analyzing the convergence behavior and evaluating the computational complexity of the novel PIC detector, extensive simulations are conducted to assess the performance of the proposed PIC detector. Numerical results show that the proposed PIC significantly outperforms other PIC detectors in terms of both BER and convergence speed. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In the OpCSMA, each mobile terminal (MT) is assumed to have the knowledge of its channel state information (CSI). At each idle time slot, an MT sends a packet if the corresponding channel gain is above the threshold, which is determined such that the probability of accessing the medium is maintained to be p for any idle slots. Using the infinite user model, it is proved that the OpCSMA provides significant increase in the expected capacity compared to p-persistent CSMA. In addition, the expected capacity of the OpCSMA is shown to be proportional to ln G at low SNR where G is the offered load. Simulation results corroborate the above findings in slow fading channels.	channel state information;mobile phone;multi-user;network packet;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Chan-Soo Hwang;Kibeom Seong;John M.

First the frequency independent IQ imbalance is estimated using a preamble and, subsequently, the frequency selective IQ imbalance is removed using adaptive filtering. A numerical performance analysis reveals that the presented approach effectively mitigates the influence of IQ mismatch in OFDM-based space division multiplexing systems experiencing both TX and RX IQ imbalance.	adaptive filter;bit error rate;mimo;multiplexing;numerical analysis;time-invariant system;transmitter	Tim C.

However, optimizing such experimental jammers is a challenging task. In this paper the novelty and applicability of using genetic algorithms (GA) for developing advanced digital radio frequency memory jammer techniques against radars employing the constant false alarm rate detection algorithm are demonstrated. It is shown how GA can handle the large and complex solution space of the problem, finding a Pareto front in the problem domain of jammer transmitting power versus detectability, producing new jamming techniques and fresh insight into the complex radar-jammer dynamics. As a main result, it is demonstrated how GA is capable of producing effective multi-resistant jamming techniques. This is an important jamming property when operating against uncertain radar detection algorithms in real world scenarios. Furthermore, single- and multi-resistant jamming techniques are shown to handle noisy environments, and the important issue of jamming robustness against varying target radar cross section is addressed. The energy efficiency of GA jamming techniques is investigated by comparing the efficiency of more conventional noise jamming techniques.	constant false alarm rate;cross section (geometry);feasible region;genetic algorithm;next-generation network;pareto efficiency;problem domain;radar;radio frequency;radio jamming;software release life cycle;transmitter	Hans Jonas Fossum Moen;Stein Kristoffersen	2008		10.1145/1389095.1389398	mathematical optimization;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;multi-objective optimization;pulse-doppler radar;digital radio frequency memory;near-far problem;radar jamming and deception	Robotics	28.00708657068608	80.13299838919076	32567

We present an approach based on an extended sliding window and the appropriate decision metric. For the common case that the synchronization word is followed by encoded data we present a solution which exploits the error detection capability of the channel decoder and applies a list decoding approach for frame synchronization. The proposed methods are validated through computer simulations in the deep-space communication uplink and show significant performance gains compared to current solutions.	additive white gaussian noise;computer simulation;error detection and correction;list decoding;telecommunications link;the sync	Stephan Pfletschinger;Mònica Navarro;Pau Closas	2014	2015 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7417211	synchronization;real-time computing;telecommunications;frame synchronization;computer science;phase-shift keying;correlation	Robotics	45.6902047120915	68.98188269789102	32641

Further, we show that the Fisher concentration parameter is: (1) completely determined by the corresponding Ricean K-factors and the cross-correlation coefficient between the diversity branches, both of which can be estimated from simple measurements of received power vs. time, and (2) a good indicator of the level of cross-polar discrimination (XPD) on the channel. The insights gained are potentially useful to those engaged in the development and validation of schemes that use either polarization re-use or polarized MIMO.	approximation algorithm;coefficient;cross-correlation;first-order predicate;mimo;mimo-ofdm;polarization (waves);simulation	Kyle N.

We begin by obtaining the handoff rate for a mobile user in an irregular cellular network with the access point locations modeled as a homogeneous Poisson point process. The received signal-to-interference-ratio (SIR) distribution along with a chosen SIR threshold is then used to obtain the probability of coverage. To capture potential connection failures due to mobility, we assume that a fraction of handoffs result in such failures. Considering a multi-tier network with orthogonal spectrum allocation among tiers and the maximum biased average received power as the tier association metric, we derive the probability of coverage for two cases: 1) the user is stationary (i.e., handoffs do not occur, or the system is not sensitive to handoffs); 2) the user is mobile, and the system is sensitive to handoffs. We derive the optimal bias factors to maximize the coverage. We show that when the user is mobile, and the network is sensitive to handoffs, both the optimum tier association and the probability of coverage depend on the user's speed; a speed-dependent bias factor can then adjust the tier association to effectively improve the coverage, and hence system performance, in a fully-loaded network.	frequency allocation;interference (communication);multitier architecture;point process;stationary process;wireless access point	Sanam Sadr;Raviraj S.

The decoder architecture is arranged in clusters of serial processing units, which are configurable to process all the codes in the standard and, at the same time, to support multiple frame decoding. An optimization methodology of the iteration latency is also described, which relates to the order of the messages updated by the processors, as well as to the sequence of layers the decoder goes through. The logic synthesis on 65 nm CMOS technology with low- power standard-cell library, shows that the proposed design is suitable for portable devices, the throughput ranging from 180 to 410 Mbps, and the power consumption being below 235 mW.	algorithm;cmos;central processing unit;code word;data rate units;decibel;error detection and correction;iteration;logic synthesis;low-density parity-check code;mathematical optimization;mobile app;personal digital assistant;scalability;semiconductor industry;throughput	Massimo Rovini;Giuseppe Gentile;Francesco Rossi;Luca Fanucci	2007	IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.620	list decoding;concatenated error correction code;logic synthesis;real-time computing;low-density parity-check code;soft-decision decoder;sequential decoding;computer science;theoretical computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;iterative method;error floor;statistics	EDA	45.12883509995964	62.55840566399143	32725

In this model, the conditional entropy of transmitting moments is the largest, and the prior data are used as the sample space, while Lagrange multipliers are selected as optimization variables. Hybrid Chaotic Particle Swarm Optimization (HCPSO) that is used in the model takes the dual programming of the conditional maximum entropy as objective function, and the conditional maximum entropy model is ultimately determined through this optimization algorithm. Compared with the usual method of fixed threshold, the simulation results show that the conditional maximum entropy method not only has longer effective communication time, but also can effectively increase the uncertainty of transmitting moments. The more the uncertainty of transmitting moments, the better the low probability of intercept performance is. So the burst communication has better performance of low probability of intercept using conditional maximum entropy model.	algorithm;conditional entropy;lagrange multiplier;linear partial information;loss function;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;particle swarm optimization;principle of maximum entropy;simulation;transmitter;visual intercept	Yuxiao Yang;Jianjiang Zhou;Fei Wang;Chenguang Shi	2014	2014 IEEE China Summit & International Conference on Signal and Information Processing (ChinaSIP)	10.1109/ChinaSIP.2014.6889320	mathematical optimization;multi-swarm optimization;electronic engineering;telecommunications;mathematics	Robotics	38.95293554031808	69.98308907190122	32750

If all users have a common clock synchronization, symbol timing needs not to be recovered in each burst. A digital processor for carrier recovery without preambles, in the presence of frequency offset, is considered. As an example, a 2 Mb/s QPSK transmission system is considered in which E/sub b//N/sub o/=10 dB, and the burst and estimation interval length L=15. Using the algorithm described and averaging eight successive estimated frequency offsets, in order to eliminate anomalous errors, the BER (bit error rate) degradation is equal to 0.14 dB when Delta f=20 kHz. >	burst mode (computing);spectral density estimation	Sandro Bellini;Claudio Molinari;Guido Tartara	1990	IEEE Trans.

In this paper, we address the design of reconfigurable multiweight wavelength-time optical codes that lead to secure multimedia transmission in OCDMA networks. The proposed multiweight wavelength-time optical codes are constructed based on quasigroups (QGs) for wavelength hopping and one-dimensional multiweight optical orthogonal codes (MWOOCs) for time spreading, then called QG/MWOOCs. Both QGs and MWOOCs are randomly generated by computer search. As a result, the proposed QG/MWOOCs have many different code set groups which differ in both time and wavelengths positions. Furthermore, a secure network is suggested by employing reconfigurable encoders/decoders array waveguide gratings (AWGs)-based, which allow the users to change their codewords patterns to protect against eavesdropping. Finally, the degree of security which may provide by the proposed scheme is analyzed. The results show that the proposed scheme offers both differentiated QoS and differentiated quality-of-security (QoSec) in multimedia OCDMA networks.	binary decoder;code (cryptography);code word;confidentiality;encoder;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;procedural generation;quality of service;random search;reconfigurable computing;search algorithm;wavelength-division multiplexing	Nasaruddin;Tetsuo Tsujioka	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2008.1019	quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	HPC	49.37576320714597	66.80770347870244	32883

Each sensor node in the network samples the sound field, quantizes the samples and transmits the encoded samples to some central unit, which computes an estimate of the original sound field based on the information received from all the microphones. Our analysis is based on the spectral properties of the sound field, which are induced by the physics of wave propagation and have a significant impact on the efficiency of the chosen sampling lattice and coding scheme. As field acquisition by a sensor network typically implies spatio-temporal sampling of the field, a multidimensional sampling theorem for homogeneous random fields with compactly supported spectral measures is proved. To assess the loss of information implied by source coding, rate distortion functions for various coding schemes and sampling lattices are determined. In particular, centralized coding, independent coding and some multiterminal schemes are compared. Under the assumption of spectral whiteness of the sound field, it is shown that sampling with a quincunx lattice followed by independent coding is optimal as it achieves the lower bound given by centralized coding.	acoustic cryptanalysis;centralized computing;data compression;distortion;microphone;multidimensional sampling;multiseat configuration;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;propagation delay;rate–distortion theory;sampling (signal processing);sensor node;software propagation	Robert L.

Information-theoretic security-widely accepted as the strictest notion of security-relies on channel coding techniques that exploit the inherent randomness of the propagation channels to strengthen the security of digital communications systems. Motivated by recent developments in the field, we aim to characterize the fundamental secrecy limits of wireless networks. The paper is comprised of two separate parts. In Part I, we define the intrinsically secure communications graph (iS-graph), a random graph which describes the connections that can be securely established over a large-scale network. We provide conclusive results for the local connectivity of the Poisson iS-graph, in terms of node degrees and isolation probabilities. We show how the secure connectivity of the network varies with the wireless propagation effects, the secrecy rate threshold of each link, and the noise powers of legitimate nodes and eavesdroppers. We then propose sectorized transmission and eavesdropper neutralization as viable strategies for improving the secure connectivity. Our results help clarify how the spatial density of eavesdroppers can compromise the intrinsic security of wireless networks. In Part II of the paper, we study the achievable secrecy rates and the effect of eavesdropper collusion.	channel capacity;data compression;forward error correction;information-theoretic security;random graph;randomness;secure communication;software propagation;theory	Pedro C.

4d4a591943ed25732e66f72c49d63daae2bb3f2a	multi-pair bidirectional relaying with full-duplex massive mimo experiencing channel aging		In this paper, we study a multi-pair bidirectional (or two-way) full-duplex (FD) massive MIMO relay (FDMMR) system, where the relay employs massive antennas and is operated in the amplify-and-forward (AF) mode. We analyze its spectral efficiency (SE) performance, when both imperfect channel estimation and channel aging effect are considered. We propose four power-scaling schemes based on the zero-forcing reception/zero-forcing transmission (ZFR/ZFT) relaying processing. Assuming that the number of relay antennas approaches infinity, the SE is analyzed in the context of the proposed power scaling schemes. Our analytical results show that the inter-pair interference caused by the other user pairs as well as the self-interference can be completely eliminated by the ZFR/ZFT processing at the relay. The self-loop interference and the inter- user interference can also be cancelled, if a power scaling scheme is carefully selected. Furthermore, our studies show that the channel aging may significantly degrade the SE of the system.	anisotropic filtering;channel state information;duplex (telecommunications);image scaling;interference (communication);loop (graph theory);mimo;relay;spectral efficiency	Yongmin Zhang;Lixin Li;Huisheng Zhang;Wei Chen;Lie-Liang Yang;Zhu Han	2017	GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254819	laser power scaling;duplex (telecommunications);real-time computing;mimo;interference (wave propagation);computer science;electronic engineering;spectral efficiency;relay;communication channel	Mobile	37.54569475579148	82.70661716447701	33129

Comparative analysis between the one central antenna arrangement and the proposed one is presented.

Optimal statistic allows to generate valuations with uniform distribution we get this way maximum information capacity. It will be shown that in this approach we practically can get as close to capacity of the model as we want (found numerically: lost 10−10bit/node for Hard Square).

In the proposed scheme, a symbol sequence in the frequency domain is partitioned into several sub-blocks which are multiplied by different orthogonal phase sequences whose length and number are shorter and smaller than those used in the conventional SLM. Then, among various sequences in the time domain generated after the IFFT for the SLM sub-blocks, the sub-block combination with the lowest PAPR is selected and transmitted. Simulation results show that the proposed P-SLM scheme significantly reduces the number of IFFT calculation and multiplication than the conventional SLM without loss of PAPR reduction performance.	itil;power architecture platform reference	Suckchel Yang;Yoan Shin	2008	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e91-b.4.1198	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;algorithm	Crypto	46.97211000411085	81.04338664160622	33182

At this low-density parity-check codes (LDPCC) can be utilized which are then concatenated with a modulator. The concatenation of LDPCC and modulator is done via a bit interleaver which has the task to spread information. While the matched design of an optimal LDPC degree distribution with respect to a given mapping scheme is well observed it is often assumed that the probabilistic values passed from demodulator to the LDPCC decoder are independent due to the mapping interleaver. However for higher order modulations, e.g. 16-QAM or 256-QAM, more and more bits are getting correlated during the demodulation process. The connectivity of these correlated bits have to be considered during the design of the mapping interleaver with respect to the graph of the concatenated LDPC codes. In this paper, we present the design of mapping interleavers of BICM schemes utilizing LDPC codes. Simulation results show the strong influence of correlated inputs to the performance of LDPC decodes. This correlations can cause a high error floor if the mapping interleaver is not carefully designed.	concatenation;degree distribution;error floor;forward error correction;lambda lifting;lifting scheme;low-density parity-check code;modulation;simulation	Frank Kienle;Norbert Wehn	2008	VTC Spring 2008 - IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2008.167	electronic engineering;convolutional code;low-density parity-check code;degree distribution;higher-order logic;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;demodulation;microelectronics;bandwidth;statistics;modulation	Embedded	43.146345587806266	69.1500477596579	33192

Compared with existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm only requires the source to transmit the channel training sequences, does not need relays to perform any task of channel estimation, and yields smaller estimation error. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can be extended to multi-hop MIMO relay systems with any number of hops. Numerical examples are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the PARATUCK2-based channel estimation algorithm.

However, when D2D users are far away from each other or the quality of D2D channel is not good enough for direct communication, transmission via a direct link is not a good choice. In this paper, we focus on the performance of relay assisted D2D network. Unlike the previous works that mainly study practical relay selection algorithm, we analyze the achievable transmission capacity of multi-hop D2D system over Rayleigh fading channels. First, by using stochastic geometry, the probability distribution of end-to-end signal-to-interference- plus-noise ratio (SINR) in the spectrum sharing network is formulated. Then the achievable transmission capacity is modeled as an optimization problem with constraints that guarantee the outage probability of both cellular and D2D systems. Finally the optimal design of D2D spatial density and transmit power is analyzed and the achievable transmission capacity of multi-hop D2D system is given in closed-form expression. Numerical results show the performance of the D2D network can be effectively enhanced by relay-assisted transmission. We also verify the optimal design of D2D parameters and evaluate the influence of the number of relay hops on the system capacity and power efficiency.	channel capacity;downtime;end-to-end principle;inline linking;mathematical optimization;optimal design;optimization problem;performance per watt;principle of good enough;rayleigh fading;relay;selection algorithm;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio	Si Wen;Xiaoyue Zhu;Yanchao Lin;Zhesheng Lin;Xin Zhang;Dacheng Yang	2013	2013 IEEE 78th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2013.6692074	signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;radio resource management;probability;mathematics;relay channel;statistics;computer network	Mobile	30.966277614220637	85.64840793796105	33228

We first derive two design criteria for general optimal training: one is in the time domain and the other is in the frequency domain. The frequency-domain design criterion leads to a systematic design procedure that can be used to construct any optimal training sequences. Combining the two design criteria, we further derive a design criterion for optimal training with the extra constraint on the constant modulus. Two classes of optimal constant-modulus designs are found. It is shown that the existing optimal constant-modulus training design is a special case of the second class of our designs	british undergraduate degree classification;eisenstein's criterion;modulus of continuity;modulus robot	Qingyu Zhu;Zhiqiang Liu	2006	IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, 2006.

This strategy uses a Hierarchical eXclusive Code (HXC) that allows full decoding of the hierarchical symbols at the relay. The HXC represents two data sources only through the exclusive law and requires side information on the complementary data at the destination (which naturally holds for the 2-WRC). The HDF strategy has the advantage over classical MAC stage relaying with joint decoding that its rate region extends beyond the classical MAC region. We evaluate the hierarchical MAC capacity regions for various alphabets, constellation point indexing and various channel parametrization and compare that to the alphabet limited and unconstrained cut-set bounds.	hierarchical data format;relay channel	Jan Sýkora;Alister G.

In particular, we focus on the half-duplex alternative relaying strategy, in which the two relays operate alternatively over time. With different amounts of delay, two conferencing strategies are proposed, each of which can be implemented by either a general two-side conferencing scheme (for which both of the two conferencing links are used) or a special-case one-side conferencing scheme (for which only one of the two conferencing links is used). Based on the most general two-side conferencing scheme, we derive the achievable rates by using the decode-and-forward (DF) relaying scheme. By further exploiting the properties of the optimal solutions, the simpler one-side conferencing is shown to achieve the same rate as the two-side conferencing in term of the achievable rates under arbitrary channel conditions. Based on this result, the DF rate in closed-form is obtained, and the principle to use which one of the two conferencing links for one-side conferencing is also established. Moreover, the DF scheme is shown to be upper-bound-achieving under certain relay scheduling and conferencing strategy. Finally, numerical results are provided to validate our analysis.	direction finding;duplex (telecommunications);numerical analysis;out-of-band agreement;relay channel;scheduling (computing)	Chuan Huang;Shuguang Cui	2013	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2013.010413.120278	telecommunications;computer science;operating system;scheduling;computer network	Mobile	34.09168146390722	73.85260346714973	33336

The computational complexity of the ML solution based on a multi-dimensional exhaustive search is prohibitive. The existing solutions reduce the complexity by replacing the multidimensional search with a sequence of single-dimensional searches. However, those solutions suffer from either poor estimation accuracy or is still of high complexity. In this paper, we propose a new approach called as the divide-and-update frequency estimator (DUFE), which outperforms the existing solutions in the sense that it has lower computational complexity while maintaining high estimation accuracy similar to the exact ML solution. Performance and complexity comparisons are provided with numerical results to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	brute-force search;computational complexity theory;estimation theory;frequency offset;numerical analysis;scheme;subcarrier;telecommunications link	Zhongjun Wang;Yan Xin;George Mathew	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2008.656	mathematical optimization;mathematics;maximum likelihood;statistics	Robotics	49.39673374129962	78.52558157050377	33386

However, they are not suitable for the uplink MC-SS system because every user's signal arrives at the base station asynchronously. In this paper, we propose a patterned timing synchronization algorithm which can estimate the signal arrival times for every user.

Union bound expressions are derived for the bit and symbol error rate of the new format, which together with Monte Carlo simulations give the power efficiency at both low and high SNR.

To avoid the inherent ambiguities of this problem, the spatial correlation matrix of the source signals must be non-white and known at the receiver. In practice, this can be achieved by a number of simple linear precoding techniques at the transmitter side. More specifically, it is shown in the paper that if the source correlation matrix has different eigenvalues, then the decoding process can be formulated as the problem of maximizing the sum of a set of weighted variances of the signal estimates. Exploiting the special structure of OSTBCs, this problem can be reduced to a principal component analysis (PCA) problem, which allows us to derive computationally efficient batch and adaptive blind decoding algorithms. The algorithm works for any OSTBC (including the popular Alamouti code) with a single receive antenna.

To enable HS/EGC diversity for non-constant modulus (NCM) modulation formats, we propose the relevant HS/EGC receiver structure and decision variable. By deriving the moment generating function (MGF) of the HS/EGC output signals and with the help of the Parseval's theorem, we develop a general analytical framework to evaluate the error and outage probabilities of pre-detection HS/EGC for a large class of modulation formats and versatile system and channel parameters. Simulation results verify the validity of our proposed receiver structure and the accuracy of our analysis. Performance comparison with HS/MRC shows that HS/EGC achieves the same diversity order as HS/MRC.

A composite channel consists of a collection of different channels with a distribution characterizing the probability that each channel is in operation. The Shannon capacity of a channel is the highest rate asymptotically achievable with arbitrarily small error probability. Under this definition, the transmission strategy used to achieve the capacity must achieve arbitrarily small error probability for all channels in the collection comprising the composite channel. The resulting capacity is dominated by the worst channel in its collection, no matter how unlikely that channel is. We, therefore, broaden the definition of capacity to allow for some outage. The capacity versus outage is the highest rate asymptotically achievable with a given probability of decoder-recognized outage. The expected capacity is the highest average rate asymptotically achievable with a single encoder and multiple decoders, where channel side information determines the channel in use. The expected capacity is a generalization of capacity versus outage since codes designed for capacity versus outage decode at one of two rates (rate zero when the channel is in outage and the target rate otherwise) while codes designed for expected capacity can decode at many rates. Expected capacity equals Shannon capacity for channels governed by a stationary ergodic random process but is typically greater for general channels. The capacity versus outage and expected capacity definitions relax the constraint that all transmitted information must be decoded at the receiver. We derive channel coding theorems for these capacity definitions through information density and provide numerical examples to highlight their connections and differences. We also discuss the implications of these alternative capacity definitions for end-to-end distortion, source-channel coding, and separation.	channel capacity;code;codec;distortion;downtime;encoder;end-to-end principle;ergodicity;forward error correction;information design;numerical analysis;shannon capacity of a graph;stationary process;stochastic process;sun outage	Michelle Effros;Andrea J.

We begin by recalling the theory of particle filtering and we put the emphasis on the key point of such a technique, the sampling importance resampling (SIR) or the sequential importance sampling (SIS). Then, we present a mathematical model which allows to represent the transmitted symbols as the state of a stochastic system which can be estimated by particle filters. Furthermore, we propose a basic equalizer structure with particle filters and we investigate several improvement strategies which help to obtain better estimation results with a lower number of particles. Finally, simulation results in the context of GSM/EDGE are given which show that the proposed particle filter equalizer, outperforms the well known extended Kalman filter.	coefficient;computation;equalization (communications);extended kalman filter;importance sampling;mathematical model;newton's method;particle filter;sampling (signal processing);simulation;stochastic process;turbo equalizer;viterbi algorithm;whole earth 'lectronic link	A.

We determine the system error probability via integrated exponent function under amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relay strategies. The most significant difference between AF and DF system error probability evaluations lies in a minimized cut-set bound of transmission rate under the DF strategy. There are many cases among transmission rate intervals for different system parameters (e.g. transmit power) and it is extremely complex to derive the system error probability for the DF strategy. We obtain a relatively simple result, which unifies various cases by a few expressions. Numerical results show that the system error probability decreases with the increase of the public message. Moreover, in order to draw deep insight into the reliability requirement of each source node in this network, we provide the error exponent region (EER) for different source nodes to show the trade-off of error probability among source nodes.	anisotropic filtering;direction finding;enhanced entity–relationship model;error exponent;interactive machine translation;numerical method;relay	Pan-liang Deng;Yuanan Liu;Gang Xie;Xiaoyu Wang;Bihua Tang;Jianfeng Sun	2011	Science China Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-011-4326-4	mathematical optimization;telecommunications;mathematics;relay channel;error exponent;statistics	ML	34.80862813709953	80.65136227294266	33828

Our main result is a very tight approximation of the probability density function (PDF) of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the output of the combiner. Based on this result, accurate approximation of significant performance criteria, such as outage probability and average symbol error rate (ASER) are derived. We also evaluate the average bit error rate (ABER) for several coherent and non-coherent modulation schemes, using a closed-form expression for the moment-generating function (MGF) of the output SNR for MRC receivers. In addition, we derive some analytical expressions for channel capacity under various adaptation policies such as optimal rate adaptation (ORA), Optimal simultaneous power and rate adaptation (OPRA), Channel inversion with fixed rate (CIFR), and Truncated channel inversion with fixed rate (TCIFR). The proposed mathematical analysis is complemented by numerous numerical results, which point out the effects of fading severity on the overall system performance. Computer simulations are also performed to verify the validity and the accuracy of the proposed theoretical approach.	approximation algorithm;mast radiator	Abdelmajid Bessate;Faissal El Bouanani	2016	Physical Communication	10.1016/j.phycom.2016.09.001	telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;channel capacity;statistics	Theory	38.26855532918401	78.03350819301664	33855

The proposed scheme is a hybrid one comprising Bayesian and greedy methods. It can improve the estimation performance by incorporating the spatial channel knowledge that the neighboring antennas in an array share the same support. The pilot overhead can be reduced by utilizing the data symbols using a reliability measure for channel estimation. Moreover, the effect of interfering and non-interfering pilots on the estimation performance will be investigated. It will be shown that the proposed hybrid technique performs similar or better than the Bayesian method with substantially reduced complexity.	camera serial interface;channel state information;compressed sensing;computational complexity theory;greedy algorithm;multi-user mimo;newton's method;overhead (computing);scenario (computing);simulation;software propagation;sparse matrix;spatial multiplexing;spectral efficiency;thresholding (image processing)	Javier García;Jawad Munir;Amine Mezghani;Josef A.

Each user is assumed to have a distinct set of spreading sequences, with a different spreading sequence for each carrier in each user’s set. We show that when these sets of sequences are chosen to be the mutually orthogonal (MO) complementary sets of sequences, multiple-access interference is minimal on a nonfading channel. As a result of the autocorrelation sidelobe cancellation properties of the MO complementary sequences, it is possible to pack symbols more closely together on the nonfading channel, resulting in a higher data rate than in multicarrier CDMA using the same spreading sequence for each carrier. The resulting communication system scheme results in an easily parallelized receiver architecture that may be useful in nonfading coherent channels, such as the optical fiber channel or the Rician channel with a strong line-of-sight component. On the Rayleigh fading channel, the performance of the system is identical to that of multicarrier CDMA employing a single spreading sequence per user, with only a minimal increase in receiver complexity.	autocorrelation;coherence (physics);complementary sequences;fibre channel;interference (communication);line-of-sight (missile);optical fiber;parallel computing;rayleigh fading;uncompressed video	Shu-Ming Tseng;Mark R.

This paper presents a general power beacon (PB) assisted multi-source transmission network. Two network operating modes, namely the information transmission (IT) mode with zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming and the non-IT mode with equal power transmission are developed. Using Markov chain theory, the energy arrival and departure of each finite-capacity storage at the source is characterized mathematically, and the comprehensive analytical expression of the connection outage probability (COP) is derived. Our results reveal that the COP can be significantly improved via increasing the number of sources deployed in the proposed network with finite transmit power of PB.	arabic numeral 0;beamforming;downtime;markov chain;multi-source;nuclear power plants;numerous;synaptic transmission;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding;disease transmission	Xuanxuan Tang;Yansha Deng;Yueming Cai;Wendong Yang;Arumugam Nallanathan	2018	2018 10th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2018.8555908	outage probability;transmitter power output;computer network;power transmission;wireless;computer science;beamforming;multi-source;markov chain;transmission (mechanics)	Mobile	33.90934459857645	81.51067925396043	33951

The proposed scheme introduces the signal’s polarization state (PS), amplitude, and phase as the information-bearing parameters. Thus, the data rate can be further enhanced on the basis of the traditional amplitude–phase modulation. Also, since the transmitted signal’s PS completely manipulated by orthogonally dual-polarized antennas is unaffected by PA, PAPM can let PA work in its nonlinear region to acquire high PA efficiency. To further optimize the PA energy efficiency based on PAPM, a constrained optimization problem regarding the output back-off value and the ratio between the data carried by the PS and the amplitude–phase is formulated, and the distribution of the optimum solutions is presented. The simulation results show that PAPM can improve the PA energy efficiency significantly.	audio power amplifier;constrained optimization;constraint (mathematics);data rate units;mathematical optimization;modulation;nonlinear system;open biomedical ontologies;optimization problem;pa-risc;polarization (waves);simulation	Dong Wei;Chunyan Feng;Caili Guo	2013	Annales des Télécommunications	10.1007/s12243-012-0341-8	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	Mobile	45.55753730334186	84.69082500085223	34006

This growth in capacity is gain at the cost of decrease in performance of the conventional systems; and usually it is tried to use channel coding methods or multi-user detectors to compensate this decrease. Because of advantages of using coding methods joined with multiuser detectors in achieving better performance and also because of some benefits of using (Low Density Parity Check) LDPC method in comparison with similar capacity achieving coding methods, in this article, an iterative multi-user detector for an overloaded LDPC Coded CDMA system is proposed. This receiver consists of a combination of matched filters in the first stage and a linear (Minimum Mean Square Error) MMSE detector and an Interference Cancellation (IC) scheme in the successive stages. In the suggested method, a bank of LDPC decoders gives the soft information to the IC blocks, which help for the better interference cancellation. Comparing the performance of the proposed system with that of Turbo coded system shows that the proposed system, in addition to advantages of using LDPC codes instead of Turbo codes, has better bit error rate performance.	low-density parity-check code	Paeiz Azmi;Tahereh Shojaee Zand	2012	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-011-0324-5	real-time computing;telecommunications;mathematics	Mobile	44.7292749299685	79.76733814667315	34273

The PIC group decoding complexity depends on the group size and is between the lowest linear receiver complexity and the highest ML decoding complexity. The symbol rate for a space-time code achieving full diversity with the PIC group decoding is also between those for the linear receivers and the ML decoding. In this paper, we propose a new decoding, called conditional PIC group decoding, that is between the PIC group decoding and the ML decoding. With the proposed new decoding, we obtain a new design criterion for space-time codes to achieve full diversity, which is also between the one with the PIC group decoding and the one with the ML decoding. We then present some designs that satisfy the new criterion and in the meantime have higher symbol rates than that for the PIC group decoding.	code;decoding methods;interference (communication);simplified instructional computer;vii	Tianyi Xu;Xiang-Gen Xia	2010	2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513712	block code;list decoding;single antenna interference cancellation;telecommunications;sequential decoding;size of groups, organizations, and communities;mathematics;signal-to-noise ratio;space–time code;statistics;mimo;satisfiability	Crypto	43.29681873959224	71.31104887991737	34301

The excess of bandwidth available at E-band frequencies plus the ultra-dense deployment of 5G millimeter wave basestations provide tremendous capacity to the 5G mobile network. In order to speed up the real deployment of millimeter wave basestations especially in dense urban scenarios, an inexpensive wireless connection between the access points and to the core network is inevitable. In this 5G demo we will address the impact of in-band wireless backhaul for 5G millimeter wave communications in a typical urban scenario in Chicago. Since the millimeter-wave radio modules are half duplex the in-band wirless backhaul can create scheduling conflicts in case the backhaul links and access links to the mobile users are competing against each other for radio resources. In this demo we will analyze the scheduling conflicts caused by the half duplex millimeter wave basestations with integrated backhaul that can lead to starvation situations for mobile users. Specific solutions that resolve these types of scheduling conflicts are demonstrated and prove that in-band wireless backhaul is a very cost-efficient method to realize millimeter wave communications for 5G cellular.	backhaul (telecommunications);cost efficiency;duplex (telecommunications);next-generation network;offset binary;scheduling (computing);software deployment;wireless access point	Berthold Panzner	2016	2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)	10.1109/INFCOMW.2016.7562055	telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	24.813161552450996	84.72503838512091	34316

Using a counter with a reflecting barrier to establish whether there is sufficient evidence to reject the existing synchronization state, theoretical expressions are derived for the performance of this technique for any channel signal-to-noise ratio. The probability of a false-alarm can be reduced to an extremely small value with a penalty of only a slight increase in the average number of information bits to be processed to reject an incorrect synchronization state. Simulation results are presented for the standard rate 1/2 (7, 5) turbo code.	turbo code	Janak Sodha	2002	Signal Processing	10.1016/S0165-1684(02)00159-7	turbo equalizer;synchronization;turbo code;electronic engineering;real-time computing;soft-decision decoder;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics	Arch	48.26363386566778	72.36281084756693	34408

Patricia[7] like trees are applied to the context trees that are expanded according to the increase of the length of a source sequence in the previous researches of non-predictive source coding and model selection. The space complexity of the Patricia like context trees are O(t) where t is the length of a source sequence. On the other hand, the predictive Bayes source coding algorithm cannot use a Patricia like context tree, because it is difficult to hold and update the posterior probability parameters on a Patricia like tree. So the space complexity of the expanded trees in the predictive Bayes coding algorithm is O(t2). In this paper, we propose an efficient predictive Bayes coding algorithm using a new representation of the posterior probability parameters and the compact context tree holding the parameters whose space complexity is O(t).	algorithm;code;dspace;data compression;model selection;naive bayes classifier	Toshiyasu Matsushima;Shigeichi Hirasawa	2009	2009 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2009.5205677	computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;mathematics;statistics;source code	Theory	37.540530137208584	61.47138834940185	34429

Specifically, PA nonlinearity causes the amplitude-phase modulation (APM) constellation points to get distorted, which results in performance degradation. In this paper, we study the effect of PA nonlinearity on the bit error performance of spatial modulation MIMO (SM-MIMO) systems. When the PA distortion parameters are perfectly known at the receiver, the optimal detection rule is the one which minimizes the maximum-likelihood (ML) cost over the distorted constellation. For the case when the receiver has no knowledge of PA distortion parameters, we propose a receiver compensation technique which involves estimating the points of the distorted APM constellation based on training and performing detection using the estimated constellation. Simulation results show that, for SM-MIMO with 16-QAM, the proposed scheme achieves almost the same bit error performance as that achieved using the perfect knowledge of the PA parameters. Also, the proposed scheme is found to perform within 2-4 dB of the performance achieved using an ideal (linear) PA even at low values of input backoff.	am broadcasting;advanced power management;audio power amplifier;backoff;bit error rate;distortion;elegant degradation;mimo;mimo-ofdm;modulation;nonlinear system;pa-risc;radio frequency;simulation;x.690	Sandeep Bhat;Ananthanarayanan Chockalingam	2016	2016 IEEE 17th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)	10.1109/SPAWC.2016.7536802	electronic engineering;telecommunications;modulation error ratio;engineering;control theory	Mobile	44.320491999834935	77.89315375144696	34458

BER performance is investigated for a variety of postulated antenna characteristics in order to determine the sensitivity of BER performance to antenna pointing inaccuracies. The method employed uses motion dynamics derived from vehicular road course tests to determine power fade profiles for various antenna types as a function of antenna pointing accuracy. These power fade profiles are then used to characterize these channels as Rician multipath channels. Finally antenna pointing accuracy is mapped directly to link BER performance for an uncoded differential phase shift keying (DPSK) waveform. This study has found that this is a complex multi-dimensional problem. Power fades resulting from pointing inaccuracy generally deteriorate for larger antennas with narrow beamwidths. However, smaller antennas are more susceptible to multipath effects due to increased beamwidth. Results of this paper suggests that, contrary to what intuition might initially suggest, larger antennas with more narrow beamwidths may actually outperform smaller antennas in mobile applications	additive white gaussian noise;bit error rate;differential phase;elegant degradation;key (cryptography);mobile app;modulation;multipath propagation;operating environment;signal reflection;waveform;x.690	William T.

This new digital FPU system shares its frequency band with other wireless systems. Therefore, digital FPU system should detect and avoid the interference from other systems of which the signal format is unknown. To FPU system, it is impossible to apply conventional spectrum sensing schemes which detect known signals such as preamble in other systems. We studied the spectrum sensing scheme using the received power within preamble signals of FPU system. From the results of the baseband link-level computer simulation, it was confirmed that the proposed scheme achieved an excellent performance of the interference detection (the interference false detection rate both with and without the presence of the interference).	baseband;computer simulation;digital signal processing;duplex (telecommunications);floating-point unit;frequency band;interference (communication);prototype;test-driven development	Hiroaki Sudo;Kazuhiro Kosaka;Hideki Kanemoto;Noriyuki Gejoh;Takeshi Yasunaga;Mitsuru Uesugi	2017	2017 20th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications (WPMC)	10.1109/WPMC.2017.8301881	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;frequency band;wireless;computer science;interference (wave propagation);detect and avoid;preamble;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;baseband	Arch	46.2623766331161	83.84731092908015	34504

The efficiency of such smart system strongly depends on WSN reliability and durability, which is highly influenced by wireless channel. Relaying of the collected data over the intermediate nodes has been proven as a good strategy for WSNs. In this paper we assume amplify-and-forward relaying strategy with variable gain amplification. In order to improve system performance we propose implementation of polarization diversity. It is assumed that all communication links are influenced by Rician fading. Thus, in the case of polarization diversity, link between the source and the relay is characterized as two correlated and non-identical Rician fading channels. In this paper, we present a novel analytical model for determining the outage probability of such system, which is applicable to various fading scenarios described with different Rician K factors and average signal to noise ratios (SNR), as well as different level of diversity signals correlation and cross-polar discrimination. Numerical results show that, using polarization diversity, improvements for the considered system performance can be realized with significantly lower SNR, despite a certain level of correlation and power unbalance between the diversity branches. In that manner, compared to the system with no diversity, the total needed transmit power for achieving the same level of system performances is reduced, and thus more energy efficient communication is enabled.

The bounds are tight when the ratio max(M,N) min(M,N) = R is equal to an integer. For this case, we show that the total number of degrees of freedom is equal to min(M,N)K if K ≤ R and min(M,N) R R+1 K if K > R. Achievability is based on interference alignment. We also provide examples where using interference alignment combined with zero forcing can achieve more degrees of freedom than merely zero forcing for some MIMO interference channels with constant channel coefficients.	coefficient;integer (computer science);interference (communication);mimo;transmitter	Tiangao Gou;Syed Ali Jafar	2008	CoRR			ML	36.420507179874306	73.13686059966298	34794

Space Time Codes (STCs) and Space Multiplexing (SM) are mandatory for the WIMAX systems. The Almouti's code has played an important role for the growth and development of these systems. But, the Alamouti's code is with low data rate (half rate). For this, some research activities aimed to increase the data rate have been made. In particular, this paper deals with combining Alamouti's code and the orthogonal codes in order to benefit from the full diversity, to increase the data rate and to keep the system simple as much as possible.	code;double data rate;mimo	Nizar Ouni;Ridha Bouallegue	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-38227-7_33	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;mathematics	Crypto	44.256607975208325	81.05344068959988	34822

We also show that with N/sub t/ transmit and N/sub r/ receive antennas, the diversity order is N/sub r/-N/sub t/+1 multiplied by the free distance of the code. For the maximum likelihood receiver, we demonstrate that expurgation does not lead to a tight bound. The analysis provides insight into the relative performance of the MIMO-BICM ZF and ML receivers.	bit error rate;mimo;mimo-ofdm;modulation;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Matthew R. McKay;Iain B.

To achieve this goal with a complete VLSI solution, channel coding and MIMO detection are preferably separated so that each of them can be fitted into a single chip. In this paper, a comparative study is presented regarding various uncoded adaptive and non-adaptive MIMO detection algorithms. Intended to serve as a reference for system designers, this comparison is performed from several different perspectives including theoretical formulation, simulated BER/PER performance, and hardware complexity. All the simulations are conducted within MIMO-OFDM framework and with a packet structure similar to that of the IEEE 802.11a/g standard. As the comparison results show, the RLS algorithm appears to be an affordable solution for a wideband MIMO system targeted at gigabit wireless transmission. As a direct result of this work, an ASIC for a 25 MHz wideband 8 /spl times/ 8 MIMO-OFDM system using RLS has been designed and fabricated.	algorithm;application-specific integrated circuit;channel capacity;forward error correction;gigabit;mimo;mimo-ofdm;network packet;recursive least squares filter;simulation;spatial multiplexing;very-large-scale integration;x.690	Jingming Wang;Babak Daneshrad	2005	IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, 2005	10.1109/WCNC.2005.1424535	3g mimo;multi-user mimo;telecommunications;computer science;application-specific integrated circuit;very-large-scale integration;spatial multiplexing;computer network	Mobile	47.15724749634307	65.25324171851352	34878

Composite (hierarchical) codeword received at the relay is generally parametrized by the channel gain, forcing any processing on the relay to be dependent on channel parameters. In this paper, we introduce the codebook design criteria, which ensure that all permissible hierarchical codewords have decision regions invariant to the channel parameters (as seen by the relay). We utilize the criterion for parameter-invariant constellation space boundary to obtain the codebooks with channel parameter-invariant decision regions at the relay. Since the requirements on such codebooks are relatively strict, the construction of higher-order codebooks will require a slightly simplified design criteria. We will show that the construction algorithm based on these relaxed criteria provides a feasible way to the design of codebooks with arbitrary cardinality.

We propose a novel approach based on the iterative expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to detect the presence of the primary users, to classify the cognitive radios, and to compute their detection and false alarm probabilities. In contrast to previous work we assume that the FC has no prior information about the radios in the network except that the honest radios are in majority. As shown in the paper this is required for any algorithm to uniquely identify the CRs. Another distinguishing feature is that our approach can classify the radios into more than just two classes of honest and malicious CRs. This applies in cases where the honest CRs have different detection and false alarm probabilities, which may arise when they employ different spectrum sensing techniques or encounter dissimilar channel and noise conditions. Another case is when the CRN includes more than one type of misbehaving CRs. Our numerical results show significant improvements over the widely popular reputation-based classifier (RBC). In particular, with only a few decisions from the CRs, the proposed algorithm can quickly and efficiently classify the CRs whereas the RBC method fails even for networks with a large number of CRs. In all of our numerical results the EM algorithm converged in five or fewer iterations resulting in fast convergence of the proposed method. This makes the proposed method a good candidate for implementation in CRNs. The numerical results are also compared with the Cramer-Rao lower bound and show a close match. Simulation results are also presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in the presence of correlated observations among the radios.	cognitive radio;expectation–maximization algorithm;iteration;numerical analysis;role-based collaboration;simulation	Erfan Soltanmohammadi;Mort Naraghi-Pour	2014	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2014.140301	cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;probability;computer security;statistics;detection theory;computer network	Metrics	48.84589644125538	87.07341723802712	35021

Cross-polarized data transmission is proposed as a potential approach towards improving the spectral efficiency and at the same time permitting co-channel allocation in cellular systems. This letter evaluates a scenario where femtocell network makes use of right-hand circular polarization (RHCP) and macrocell network makes use of left-hand circular polarization (LHCP) for simultaneous transmissions even when using the same frequency spectrum. The polarizations being orthogonal to each other due to their sense of rotation ensure isolation between the networks and hence promotes interference-free independent operation with better coverage and higher throughput.	channel capacity;circular polarization;interference (communication);multiplexing;multitier architecture;polarization (waves);reconfigurability;spectral density;spectral efficiency;throughput;transmitter	Ponnu Jacob;A.

It is shown that the actual improvement of spatial diversity is not only the mean level increase, but the reduction of both the level crossing rate (LCR) and the average fade duration (AFD). The mean level gain is in the range 1.2-3 dB for the indoor-indoor channel and within 1.4-2.9 dB for the outdoor-indoor channel and the LCR/AFD improvement is between 9.5 and 15 dB for both environments. To explain the behavior of the diversity system, high resolution angle of arrival and delay information was obtained. It is concluded that it is the interference of the direct propagation path with the main reflections that causes the received field to follow a standing wave pattern and shapes the spatial diversity gain behavior.

In the ASCO-OFDM modulation scheme, the asymmetrically clipping optical (ACO)-OFDM symbols are modulated onto the odd subcarriers, and the symmetrically clipping optical (SCO)-OFDM symbols are modulated onto the even subcarriers. We found that the interference caused by clipping only affects the symbols on the even subcarriers. At the receiver, the ACO-OFDM symbols can be easily obtained by detecting the data on the odd subcarri-ers; the SCO-OFDM symbols can be successfully recovered by subtracting the estimated ACO-OFDM clipping noise and the SCO-OFDM clipping noise from the even subcarriers. The ACO-OFDM clipping noise is estimated from the received ACO-OFDM signals, and it can be reused to decrease the symbol error rate (SER) of ACO-OFDM signals. The SER of SCO-OFDM signals depend on the precision of ACO-OFDM signals. Thus, we apply an improved ACO-OFDM receiving technique in our current receiver to further improve the SER performance of SCO-OFDM signals as well as that of the whole system.	clipping (computer graphics);fast fourier transform;interference (communication);mimo-ofdm;modulation;optic axis of a crystal;optical wireless;portable document format;sensor;subcarrier	Nan Wu;Yeheskel Bar-Ness	2014	2014 48th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers	10.1109/ACSSC.2014.7094687	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	ML	48.28173629889294	80.84487627897285	35090

Besides, the interference-tolerant scenario is considered that the spatially Poisson distributed interfering secondary (unlicensed) terminals share the same frequency bands with the primary devices and are not allowed to transmit within the interference region of the primary (licensed) users. Numerical results show the effects of channel characteristics, velocity and interference region radius on the statistics. And Nakagami parameter has less effect than velocity on LCR but affects AFD more than velocity.	active format description;cognitive network;concave function;downtime;frequency band;interference (communication);simulation;sun outage;theory;velocity (software development)	Qiuyan Liu;Zhangdui Zhong	2009	2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449991	frequency modulation;cognitive radio;cognitive network;nakagami distribution;telecommunications;computer science;interference;poisson distribution;fading;statistics	Arch	37.93612377716683	77.59344902943178	35120

The aim of this work is to design the CR system in such a way that it can achieve two objectives for a given level of protection on primary user: (i) optimization of sensing time to make balance between detection performance and throughput and (ii) appropriate allocation of energy between sensing time and transmission time so as to enhance the energy efficiency of the CR system. The key parameters such as sensing time and IED parameter are set appropriately to meet the objectives. The performance is assessed in terms of throughput and energy efficiency of the system. The effect of the sensing time and the IED parameter on the performance is evaluated under a collision constraint. Furthermore, the optimal sensing time and IED parameter are investigated jointly for which the higher throughput as well as maximum energy efficiency can be obtained, and at the same time, a desired detection probability can also be maintained by the CR system.

In this paper, we propose a channel-balancing scheme for the transmission of an MDC source over time-varying channels, such as wireless links. We consider a system in which there are more subchannels than the number of descriptions and the transmission rate is adapted to the channel variation. The proposed balancing scheme is based on the polynomial-time set-partitioning algorithm using the differencing method. It is shown that the proposed scheme results in a low-delay and high-throughput transmission, which is desirable for real-time multimedia content delivery over wireless channels.	algorithm;approximation;autoregressive integrated moving average;binary erasure channel;code;digital distribution;digital subchannel;high-throughput computing;multiple description coding;network packet;real-time clock;throughput;time complexity;transmitter	Ming Kang;Mohamed-Slim Alouini	2005	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2005.853974	real-time computing;error detection and correction;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;statistics	Mobile	40.334505892368504	68.79562973996056	35171

However, these receivers often have higher excess mean squared error (MSE) and hence poorer performance than training-sequence based adaptive MMSE receivers. In this paper, an improved correlation matrix estimation scheme for blind adaptive MMSE receivers is provided. The new scheme takes advantage of the fact that the desired linear receiver can be expressed as a function of the interference correlation matrix only, rather than the total data correlation matrix. A theoretical analysis is performed for the at fading case which predicts that the new estimation scheme will result in signiicant performance improvement. Blind adaptive MMSE receivers with the new estimation scheme appear to achieve performance comparable to the training-sequence based adaptive MMSE receivers. Detailed computer simulations for the fast multipath fading environment verify that the proposed scheme yields strong performance gains over previous methods.	computer simulation;cross-correlation;interference (communication);mean squared error;multi-user;multipath propagation;offset binary	Wanshi Chen;Urbashi Mitra	2001		10.1109/GLOCOM.2001.965520	computer simulation;multipath propagation;code division multiple access;covariance matrix;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;radio receiver;spread spectrum;statistics	ML	49.06809252563596	75.72661296402873	35237

For comparison purposes, the Cramér- Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for the SNR estimators are derived. The performance of the estimators is evaluated by simulations and comparing with CRLBs in terms of the mean-square-error. Simulated results show that for a large spreading factor the proposed scheme performs well over a wide SNR range in comparisons with CRLBs.	fm broadcasting;mean squared error;modulation;multipath propagation;rayleigh fading;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Guofa Cai;Lin Wang;Long Kong;Georges Kaddoum	2016	2016 IEEE 83rd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2016.7504478	frequency modulation;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;maximum likelihood;signal-to-noise ratio;statistics	Visualization	49.58645380691301	76.16877035760237	35242
2c319b345fd62265d57c1f6b6c57231c2cb1ff35	diversity gain of one-shot communication over molecular timing channels		We study diversity in one-shot communication over molecular timing channels. In the considered channel model the transmitter simultaneously releases a large number of information particles, where the information is encoded in the time of release. The receiver decodes the information based on the random time of arrival of the information particles. We characterize the asymptotic exponential decrease rate of the probability of error as a function of the number of released particles. We denote this quantity as the system diversity gain, as it depends both on the number of particles transmitted as well as the receiver detection method. Three types of detectors are considered: the maximum-likelihood (ML) detector, a linear detector, and a detector that is based on the first arrival (FA) among all the transmitted particles. We show that for random propagation characterized by right-sided unimodal densities with zero mode, the FA detector is equivalent to the ML detector, and significantly outperforms the linear detector. Moreover, even for densities with positive mode, the diversity gain achieved by the FA detector is very close to that achieved by the ML detector and much higher than the gain achieved by the linear detector.	channel (communications);sensor;software propagation;time complexity;time of arrival;timing channel;transmitter	Yonathan Murin;Mainak Chowdhury;Nariman Farsad;Andrea J.

In the literature, ID schemes with hard-decision feedback (HDF), as well as soft-decision feedback (SDF), have been investigated. While HDF/ID exhibits a performance inferior to SDF/ID, it is much simpler to implement. To enhance the performance of HDF/ID with moderate additional complexity, we propose a uniform soft-decision feedback ID (USF/ID) scheme. The proposed scheme is applicable in both single antenna and multiple antenna communication systems.

But in 3GPP LTE system, there are two kinds of CP length, so we operate FFT twice with different CP length. In this paper, we propose a CP length pre-decision metric which is able to reduce the arithmetic complexity by half at most, with negligible performance degradation.	algorithm;compaq lte;elegant degradation;environment variable;fast fourier transform;frequency offset;physical symbol system;run-length encoding;signal-to-noise ratio;telecommunications link	YoungBum Kim;Kyunghi Chang	2009	2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5450238	synchronization;fast fourier transform;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics	Embedded	47.103399559113875	81.26317355561896	35348

The proposed code acquisition system consists of parallel M-ary orthogonal demodulators each having M correlators. The system also employs two operating modes, i.e., search and verification modes with the decision variables formulated with successive maximums of M correlator outputs. The mean acquisition time is first derived for a multiple H/sub 1/ cell case and then the probabilities of detection, miss, and false alarm are obtained for frequency-selective Rayleigh fading environments. Also provided is a computationally efficient solution for detection performance analysis by using quantized decision variables. The performance of the proposed code acquisition technique is numerically evaluated when it is applied to the initial acquisition of the mobile station requesting hand over.	parallel computing	Hyung-Rae Park	2000	IEEE Trans.

Two physical layer network coding (PNC) schemes are considered, namely two-time-slot and three-time-slot PNC, denoted by 2-PNC and 3-PNC, respectively. We derive analytical expressions for the sum-BER of these two schemes and propose to appropriately time share between modulation schemes of different dimensions according to the energy harvesting time fraction in order to normalize the spectral efficiency. Simulation and numerical experiments are performed to verify our analysis. It is observed that 3-PNC outperforms 2-PNC in terms of sum-BER when the energy harvesting time fraction is small. However, this fraction can be optimized such that the 2-PNC scheme achieves better overall sum-BER performance.	anisotropic filtering;bit error rate;clustered file system;coefficient;experiment;exponential hierarchy;linear network coding;lookup table;mathematical optimization;modulation;norm (social);numerical analysis;profiling (computer programming);relay;sandy bridge;simulation;smart battery system;spectral efficiency;traffic sign recognition;x.690	Chuling Huang;Parastoo Sadeghi;Ali Arshad Nasir	2016	2016 Australian Communications Theory Workshop (AusCTW)	10.1109/AusCTW.2016.7433611	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	Mobile	34.966178256655276	79.60719034498159	35371

The problem is of importance in Cognitive Radio systems when secondary users (SUs) are looking for available spectrum opportunities to communicate over them while sensing at Nyquist rate sampling can be costly or even impractical in case of very wide bandwidth. We first study the effect of timing offset and derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for signal recovery in the oracle-assisted case when the true active sub-carriers are assumed known. Then we propose an Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP)- based joint sparse recovery method for identifying active subcarriers when the timing offset is known. Finally we extend the problem to the case of unknown timing offset and develop a joint dictionary learning and sparse approximation algorithm, where in the dictionary learning phase the timing offset is estimated and in the sparse approximation phase active subcarriers are identified. The obtained results demonstrate that active subcarrier identification can be carried out reliably, by using the developed framework.	approximation algorithm;cognitive radio;compressed sensing;detection theory;dictionary;machine learning;matching pursuit;nyquist rate;sampling (signal processing);sparse approximation;sparse matrix;subcarrier	Seyed Alireza Razavi;Mikko Valkama;Danijela Cabric	2014	2015 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7417565	support vector machine;niobium;speech recognition;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;wireless	Robotics	53.22590073101459	81.17358891093978	35375

A new reciprocity calibration method is studied in this paper which can increase the system performance and also support online calibration. Firstly, a test device (TD) is used to send pilots to the base station (BS) to obtain the uplink (UL) channel state information (CSI). Secondly, the BS sends pilots to the TD to get the downlink (DL) CSI. Thirdly, the DL CSI is transmitted to the BS via the Internet and the calibration coefficient is calculated. Finally, by multiplying the calibration coefficient with the UL CSI from the user equipment (UE), the reciprocity calibration is performed. A simulation based on the experimental measurement results shows that the performance of our proposed method is improved significantly compared to the existing relative calibration methods.	csi-dos;channel state information;coefficient;duplex (telecommunications);internet;mimo;simulation;telecommunications link;test-driven development	Hua Luo;Yue Zhang;Li-Ke Huang;John Cosmas	2016	2016 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting (BMSB)	10.1109/BMSB.2016.7521915	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering	Embedded	42.783695401368846	83.82411020176788	35409

For a fixed encoder, a random modulator/demodulator (modem) and detector are derived. They asymptotically minimize the worst-case error probability as the blocklength of the encoder becomes large. This optimal modem is independent of the encoder, and the optimal detector is the standard correlation receiver. A simple upper bound to the performance of any encoder when used with the optimal modem and detector is presented. These results provide a benchmark with which the performance of spread-spectrum modems and robust detection rules can be compared. >	asymptotically optimal algorithm;modem	Brian L.

These observations provide a simple way to posit theorems in one area by translating the corresponding theorems in the other. However, the analogy does not extended fully, and the proof techniques often do not carry over without substantial modification. One reason for this is that information theoretic quantities are often defined asymptotically, as the dimension tends to infinity. This is in contrast to the setting in geometry, where the dimension is usually fixed. In this dissertation, we try to bridge the gap between these two areas by studying the asymptotic geometric properties of sequences of sets. Our main contribution is developing a theory to study the growth rates of intrinsic volumes for sequences of convex sets satisfying some natural growth contraints. As an illustration of the usefulness of our techniques, we consider two specific problems. The first problem is that of analyzing the Shannon capacities of power-constrained communication channels. In particular, we study a power-constrained channel arising out of the energy harvesting communication model, called the (σ, ρ)-power constrained additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. Our second problem deals with forging new connections between geometry and information theory by studying the intrinsic volumes of sequences of typical sets. For log-concave distributions, we show the existence of a new quantity called the intrinsic entropy, which can be interpreted as a generalization of differential entropy.	additive white gaussian noise;channel capacity;computer science;concave function;differential entropy;electrical engineering;expanded memory;information theory;jog dial;noise power;numerical analysis;numerical method;shannon (unit);time complexity;utility functions on indivisible goods	Varun S.

To alleviate the noise effect in detecting UWB PPM signals, this letter proposes a simple yet flexible weighted noncoherent receiver structure, which adopts a square-law integrator multiplied with a window function. The integrator outputs captured within different integration time windows are weighted and linear combined to generate decision statistic, in which smaller weights are imposed on outputs having larger noise contributions. Optimal and suboptimal weighting coefficients are derived to maximize the detection BER. Both analysis and simulations verify the effectiveness of weighted processing in reducing the noise level in noncoherent reception.	coefficient;microsoft windows;noise (electronics);sampling (signal processing);sensor;simulation;ultra-wideband;window function;world news connection;x.690	Jianjun Wu;Haige Xiang;Zhi Tian	2006	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2006.1714535	telecommunications;computer science;signal processing;ultra-wideband	Mobile	48.92377873671059	71.72034325845746	35465

In existing BIA, the coherence time of channel is assumed to be long enough, but that may not always be true in realistic scenarios. Therefore, we propose a dynamic supersymbol design method which can construct a supersymbol with limited symbol extension that is determined by the coherence time of channel. It is demonstrated that the supersymbol block length can be reduced significantly by aligning interferences in a hierarchical manner, referred to as hierarchical BIA. The key idea of hierarchical BIA is to align interferences in groups and to use the same supersymbol structure between groups, producing aligned inter-group interferences without inner-group interference. Consequently, it is observed that with a given coherence time the proposed dynamic supersymbol design that exploits hierarchical BIA achieves higher degrees of freedom than the conventional method.	algorithm;align (company);ampersand;beamforming;block code;business continuity planning;interference (communication);mode setting;norm (social);pin grid array;scheme;statistical interference;transmitter;xslt/muenchian grouping	Heecheol Yang;Wonjae Shin;Jungwoo Lee	2016	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2015.2496282	transmitter;coherence;telecommunications;network switch;antenna;mathematics;interference	Arch	38.73393481384132	85.10747443598143	35501

In this study, we propose a novel nanoscale communication method based on multi-step FRET using identical fluorophores as relay nodes between communicating nanomachines, and utilizing multi-exciton transmission scheme in order to improve the limited range of the communication and achievable transmission rate over the nanoscale channel. We investigate two communication scenarios: immobile nanomachines communicating through a channel in a host material with linearly located relay nodes, and mobile nanomachines communicating through a channel in a 3-dimensional aqueous environment with randomly deployed relay nodes. We simulate the communication over these channels with realistic algorithms considering the high degree of randomness intrinsic to FRET phenomenon. Using the simulation results and following a Monte Carlo approach, we evaluate the performance of the channels by means of information theoretical capacity and interference probability. We show that multi-step FRET-based communication significantly outperforms the other biologically inspired nanocommunication techniques proposed so far in terms of maximum achievable data transmission rates. The results underline the compatibility and practicality of the FRET-based communication for several applications ranging from molecular computers to nanosensor networks.	algorithm;channel (communications);computer;excited state;exciton;interference (communication);mobile app;molecular logic gate;monte carlo method;nanorobotics;programming paradigm;randomness;relay;resonance;simulation	Murat Kuscu;Özgür B.

While basic theoretical system performance is well understood, practical aspects such as those arising from estimating the time-varying channels due to parameter drifts or inherent channel dynamics are not so well explored. The integration of adaptive estimators for these time-varying channels into the iterative receiver is studied, and it is shown that simple correlation-based estimators are sufficient to allow adequate tracking even for time-varying channels in a multiple access environment, and that near-ideal performance of the receiver is achievable. The requirements of the estimators and their performance in the demodulation loops are investigated via system convergence functions. Quantitative analytical results are verified with selected simulation examples. Spread-spectrum access is used to illustrate the principles of iterative demodulation and other potential areas for application are identified and discussed.	channel state information;iteration;iterative method;requirement;simulation	Christian Schlegel;Marcel Jar	2015	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2015.2468681	detector;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering;control theory;iterative method;demodulation;spread spectrum	Visualization	49.49882938427091	75.03642391255823	35557

The only randomness guarantee on such a source is that the whole source has min-entropy <i>k</i> . We give an explicit deterministic extractor which extract Ω(log<i>k</i>-loglog(1/ ε)) bits with error ε , for any <i>n</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>k</i> ∈ \BBN and ε ∈ (0,1). For sources with a larger min-entropy, we can extract even more randomness. When <i>k</i> ≥ <i>n</i><sup>1/2+γ</sup>, for any constant γ ∈ (0,1/2), we can extract <i>m</i>=<i>k</i>-<i>O</i>(<i>d</i> log(1/ ε)) bits with any error ε ≥ 2<sup>-Ω(</sup><i>n</i><sup>γ</sup>). When <i>k</i> ≥ log<i>cn</i> , for some constant <i>c</i> > 0, we can extract <i>m</i>=<i>k</i>-(1/ ε)<i>O</i>(1) bits with any error ε ≥ <i>k</i><sup>-Ω(1)</sup>. Our results generalize those of Kamp and Zuckerman and Gabizon which only work for bit-fixing sources (with <i>d</i>=1 and each bit of the source being either fixed or perfectly random). Moreover, we show the existence of a nonexplicit deterministic extractor which can extract <i>m</i>=<i>k</i>-<i>O</i>(log(1/ ε)) bits whenever <i>k</i>=ω(<i>d</i>+log(<i>n</i>/ ε)) . Finally, we show that even to extract from bit-fixing sources, any extractor, seeded or not, must suffer an entropy loss <i>k</i>-<i>m</i>=Ω(log(1/ ε)). This generalizes a lower bound of Radhakrishnan and Ta-Shma on extracting from general sources.	extractor (mathematics);maxima and minima;randomness extractor	Chia-Jung Lee;Chi-Jen Lu;Shi-Chun Tsai	2006	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1007/11786986_9	combinatorics;artificial intelligence;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;deterministic system;algorithm;statistics	Theory	35.4944454346403	62.19535578187557	35644

It is known that the transmitted power can vary significantly, mainly depending on the used modulation code scheme (MCS), or the path loss between the user equipment (UE) and the eNodeB (eNB), or even the number of resource blocks (RBs) used to send the data. Even though this transmitted power, also known as irradiated power, does not correspond to the final power consumption during an UL transmission, its variability has an impact on it. Unlike existing models, this paper considers the power consumed in the radio frequency chain and the power consumed by the baseband processing. The proposed model is expected to improve the accuracy of the theoretic measurements of both the power consumption and the EE of UL transmissions in LTE systems.	baseband;compaq lte;fractal dimension;instantaneous phase;mobile phone;modulation;radio frequency;scheduling (computing);spatial variability;telecommunications link;theory;transmitter	Xavier Pons Masbernat;Raúl Palacios;Christophe Gruet;Lirida A.

In CSM systems, the multiple relay stations (RSs), which compose a virtual antenna array (VAA), independently decode the packets received from the mobile stations (MS) and forward them to the base station (BS). When the BS decodes the signal forwarded from the RSs, the potential decoding errors encountered at the RSs will result in erroneous forwarding, but their effects are mitigated by the proposed solution. Our simulation results show that when the relay link has a significantly higher signal-to-noise ratio than the direct link, the proposed decoding algorithm achieves an approximately 3 dB better performance than conventional CSM, which does not consider the deleterious effects of erroneous forwarding from the RSs.	algorithm;broadcast relay station;community climate system model;decoding methods;inline linking;linear network coding;parsing;port forwarding;reed–solomon error correction;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spatial multiplexing;unified extensible firmware interface	Kyungchun Lee;Lajos Hanzo Hanzo	2009	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2009.080804	telecommunications;computer science;base station	Mobile	36.34781014545004	76.05436088276353	35800

However, the constant appearance of EVEs was generally assumed. In other words, these works focused on how to escape from being overheard rather than designing a complete transmission scheme with random appearances of EVEs. Thus, in this paper, we take the random appearances into consideration when designing a cooperative transmission scheme in the cognitive radio network using the anti-EVE cluster beamforming (CB) strategy. When EVE is not observed, the proposed cooperative scheme based on the fair three-stage Stackelberg (FTS) game is carried out; otherwise, the conventional CB cooperative scheme without eavesdropper's channel state information is executed. In the FTS game, the cluster of SUs first determines the transmission power to help PU for packet transmissions. Afterwards, PU can also adjust its willingness of sharing transmission time. To avoid extremely selfish time allocation by PU, a referee can make a fair judgement on the time sharing based on the minimization of the difference between PU's and SUs' utility functions. Compared with the conventional method, the superior performance in the sum transmission rates and power efficiency are proved by simulation results.	beamforming;channel state information;cognitive radio;fleet telematics system;game theory;ibm systems network architecture;network packet;performance per watt;simulation;time-sharing	Wenson Chang;Yin-Hsuan Wu	2015	2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145604	simulation;telecommunications;engineering;computer security	Mobile	34.79941468848924	83.73712243795734	35868

Nonetheless, random code is inefficient in reconstructing short messages. For example, a message of k = 10 symbols requires k + 10 = 20 encoded symbols, i.e. two times the original message length in order to achieve high PCD. In this study, the authors propose micro-random code that encodes and decodes the original message using symbols of smaller dimensions, namely micro symbols. The authors’ analysis and numerical simulations show that micro-random code achieves high PCD with only k + 1 encoded symbols. As the trade-off for such a gain, the number of steps for decoding increases exponentially with each incrementing segmentation factor, α. In addition, the numerical results show that the decoding time increases by about 400% at α = 10, depending on the processing power of the system.	computational complexity theory	Zan-Kai Chong;Bok-Min Goi;Hiroyuki Ohsaki;Cheng-Kuan Bryan Ng;Hong-Tat Ewe	2015	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2015.0295	erasure code;systematic code;constant-weight code;online codes;fountain code;computer science;self-synchronizing code;theoretical computer science;repetition code;code rate;locally testable code;computational complexity theory;algorithm	Crypto	41.08780450583452	62.20789214914386	35901
e0265e49fcc0c7466e0c03a613ff9b53a2766a74	a flexible multicarrier cdma system with time-varying data rates and services	rayleigh fading	We consider an enhanced multicarrier code-division multiple access (CDMA) system that performs the spreading in the time and frequency domains simultaneously, where time-domain spreading codes are used as a main code and frequency-domain spreading codes (FDSCs) are used as a subcode. By allocating the FDSCs to users, rates and services can be dynamically matched to users’ needs. The resulting system can support different time-varying source rates and, therefore, enable multimedia applications. In addition, since the proposed scheme uses multiple carriers, it has some advantages such as the mitigated multipath fading, frequency/path diversity and narrowband interference suppression capability, in contrast to a single carrier (SC) system such as the multicode CDMA scheme. Finally, the closed-form expression for probability of bit error is derived for a frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channel. It has been also shown that the proposed system has outperformed the conventional SC RAKE system if the available bandwidth is fixed.

Two scenarios are considered insightfully: 1) the first scenario is that the base station (BS) intends to communicate with multiple users through the assistance of AF relaying, where the direct links are existent between the BS and users and 2) the second scenario is that the AF relaying is inexistent between the BS and users. To characterize the performance of the considered scenarios, new closed-form expressions for both exact and asymptomatic outage probabilities are derived.

Least Square (LS) method is a common simple way to estimate a channel initially but its efficiency is not as significant as more complex approaches. It is possible to enhance channel estimation performance by using some methods such as principal component analysis (PCA), which is not prevalent in channel estimation, and its adaptation to channel information can be challenging. PCA method improves initial estimation performance by projecting data onto direction of eigenvectors by means of using simple algebra. In this paper, channel estimation is examined in Multiple Input Multiple Output-Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) system, with significant advantages such as an acceptable performance in frequency selective fading channel. Moreover the proposed channel estimation method manipulates the benefits of MIMO channel by using the information, gained by all channels to estimate the information of each receiver.	channel state information;mimo;mimo-ofdm;multiplexing;principal component analysis	Mona Nasseri;Hamidreza Bakhshi;Sara Sahebdel;Razieh Falahian;Maryam Ahmadi	2011	IJCNS	10.4236/ijcns.2011.46045	mimo-ofdm;telecommunications;computer science;precoding;statistics;principal component analysis	Mobile	48.69003026246177	79.42865841120575	36043

The base station (BS) is equipped with three antenna arrays, each covering one third of the cell area. Each antenna array comprises a large yet finite number of antennas. The single-antenna users are randomly and uniformly distributed in the cell, transmitting to the BS utilizing full channel inversion power control. All users experience Rician fading. Receiver maximum-ratio-combining is performed at the BS. Under such a setting, we focus on one cell sector and analyze the intrasector interference in a realistic situation where the number of BS antennas is not extremely large compared with the user number. In particular, we show that, due to the line-of-sight (LoS) component of the channel, the interference is partially determined by the angles of arrival of the signals. We approximate the LoS component interference by a Beta mixture. The interference in Rician fading is then modeled as a noncentral chi-square distribution with a random noncentrality parameter, corresponding to the LoS component. The approximate interference distribution can be used to compute signal-to-interference-ratio-dependent metrics such as outage probability and average throughput.	angle of arrival;approximation algorithm;downtime;interference (communication);line-of-sight (missile);mimo;randomness;telecommunications link;throughput;transmitter	Yeqing Hu;Yi Hong;Jamie S.

IDMA employs user-specific interleavers combined with low-rate channel coding for user separation. In this paper, we consider a MIMO-IDMA system with increased spectral efficiency due to the use of higher-order symbol constellations. Based on a factor graph framework and the sum-product algorithm, we develop an iterative turbo multiuser receiver. Gaussian approximations for certain messages propagated through the factor graph lead to a complexity that scales only linearly with the number of users. To further reduce complexity, we introduce a selective message update scheme.

The design of the receiver involves the following procedure. First, adaptive correlators are constructed at different fingers, based on the scheme of generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC), to collect the multipath signals and suppress multi-access interference (MAI). In particular, a partially adaptive (PA) realization of the GSC correlators is proposed based on the Krylov subspace technique, leading to an efficient algorithm without the need of complicated matrix computations. Second, pilot symbols assisted frequency offset estimation, channel estimation and RAKE combining give the estimate of signal symbols. Finally, further performance enhancement is achieved by an iterative scheme in which the signal is reconstructed and subtracted from the GSC correlators input, leading to faster convergence of the receiver. The proposed low complexity PA receiver is suitable or the downlink of mobile satellite CDMA systems, and shown to outperform the conventional fully adaptive MMSE receiver by using a small number of pilot symbols.

The channel is modelled based on the spatial channel model (SCM) approach, which has been proposed in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standard. We also study the influence of the correlation properties of the SCM channel when the antenna spaces of the transmitter and receiver antenna are changed. The simulation results show that the SFBC coding scheme has better performance than that obtained by the VBLAST and the STBC when the same antenna element spacing is used. Especially, performance of the system is better with increased spacing between antennas at base station (BS) than at the mobile station (MS) side.	blast;bell laboratories layered space-time;channel (communications);channel capacity;compaq lte;data compression;forward error correction;frequency divider;mimo;mimo-ofdm;multiplexing;simulation;telecommunications link;transmitter	Nga Nguyen;Bach Xuan Tran;Quoc Khuong Nguyen;Van-Duc Nguyen;Byeungwoo Jeon	2014		10.1145/2557977.2557986	supply chain management;space–time block code;mimo-ofdm;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	42.13477818021149	81.06212690159678	36233

In this work, a method for reducing the sensitivity to spatial fading correlation through the bi-directional use of spatial resources is investigated. Firstly, the concept of bi-directional use of spatial resources is introduced and the fading characteristics of the proposed bi-directional multiple-input multiple-output (B-MIMO) system are investigated. The achievable rates of the B-MIMO system are then investigated and compared with those of conventional MIMO systems for beamforming and full rank transmission. Based on those results, conditions needed for the B-MIMO system to demonstrate a larger average achievable rate are evaluated. B-MIMO systems are found to efficiently reduce the sensitivity to spatial fading correlation, while supporting comparable achievable rates in spatially white environments.	beamforming;elegant degradation;mimo;mimo-ofdm	Hyungsik Ju;Xiaohu Shang;H.

Gaussian and lognormal distributions are used for ED receiver and KD receiver, respectively. Symbols are transmitted in packets and the PDF’s parameters of the hypotheses are estimated by using training symbols in each packet. The approximation of the threshold value is obtained by using these parameters.

The average total energy consumed per bit for cooperative ARQ under Quality of Service (QoS) constraints is formulated. With numerical method, the objective is optimized over the transmission data rate, the transmit power of the source and the relay, given fixed maximum retransmission number. Then, performances of various maximum retransmission numbers are analyzed. Simulation results demonstrate that cooperative ARQ with large maximum retransmission number has solid capability to save energy when the transmission energy plays a dominant role compared to circuit energy. However, for energy saving, small maximum retransmission number should be adopted on condition that tight maximum average transmission delay constraint is imposed.	anisotropic filtering;automatic repeat request;cooperative mimo;data rate units;numerical method;performance;quality of service;relay;retransmission (data networks);simulation	Rong Qiang Huang;Chunyan Feng;Tiankui Zhang	2011	The 17th Asia Pacific Conference on Communications	10.1109/APCC.2011.6152804	real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	EDA	33.55238704948878	87.39969701697218	36404

The receiver has been previously shown to perform multiple-access interference (MAI) suppression and multipath diversity combining. The adaptive implementation is based on a fractionally spaced equalizer (FSE) whose taps are updated by the leaky constant modulus algorithm (LCMA) in the cold start and the decision-directed least-mean-square (DD-LMS) algorithm when the channel eye is opened. The LCMA adds a quadratic constraint, defined as the squared norm of the FSE weight vector, to the constant modulus (CM) cost function. Simulation results show that the LCMA with a uniform initialization strategy (all taps equally set to a small non-zero value) acquires all paths associated with the desired user, suppresses MAI, and opens the channel eye for the DD-LMS algorithm to converge to the proximity of the MMSE solution.	interference (communication);multipath propagation;zero suppression	Arash Mirbagheri;Young C.

Although transmit diversity is clearly advantageous on OFDMA systems, it may not be possible that practical OFDMA systems have more than two antennas due to size, cost, or hardware limitations. Cooperative networks aim to utilize the available terminals as a collection of distributed antennas for the transmission of signals from one end of the network to the other. This paper focuses on design and performance evaluation of IEEE 802.16 MIMO-OFDMA systems with cooperative diversity. In this paper, for high-rate and reliable transmission, efficient transmission code is proposed.	cooperative multitasking;digital video broadcasting;global communications conference;list of sequence alignment software;mimo;multi-user;performance evaluation;return channel;signal-to-noise ratio;subject matter expert turing test;telecommunications link;terrestrial television	Myung-Sun Baek;Byung-Gueon Min;Young-Hwan You;Hyoung-Kyu Song	2007	IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.478	channel allocation schemes;3g mimo;multi-user mimo;channel access method;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;mimo-ofdm;telecommunications;computer science;cooperative diversity;transmit diversity;computer network;broadband networks	Visualization	27.61498064414013	82.46825079045757	36559

We consider the use of integer rings, integer fields, binary extension fields and the ring of binary matrices as potential algebraic constructs, and show that the ring constructs provide more flexibility. We use the two-way relay channel and a network containing two sources and two relays to illustrate the concept and to demonstrate the effect of fading of the wireless channels.

The cell size therefore depends on radio propagation properties and transmitted CPICH power. For efficient resource utilization, it is important that the traffic is shared fairly evenly over the base stations. This is specifically challenging in irregular networks with inhomogeneous site locations and traffic distribution. This paper discusses methods for automated CPICH power planning, based on differently detailed traffic density information and predicted radio propagation. Simulations using data from a realistically planned network indicate that the tuning results in a more evenly utilized base station power. This in turn improves the overall capacity. It is furthermore fairly robust with respect to traffic density deviations from the true traffic density.

73c2558d5d977dc0bb81e0fd9ecde6780e36472f	non-orthogonal multiple access in a downlink multiuser beamforming system with limited csi feedback	signal image and speech processing;information systems applications incl internet;communications engineering networks	Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been recognized as a promising multiple access technology for fifth generation (5G) mobile communication system. However, the advantage of NOMA is only verified under the ideal condition that the transmitter has the perfect knowledge of channel state information (CSI). In this paper, NOMA downlink multiuser system, in which the transmitter acquires the CSI through limited feedback channel, is studied. Two traditional beamforming technologies, zero-forcing beamforming and random beamforming, are investigated in the NOMA downlink multiuser system. Making use of the imperfect CSI feedback, channel direction information (CDI), and channel quality indicator (CQI), we propose the user selection scheme to reduce the interference between the NOMA users. Furthermore, a power allocation scheme is proposed to improve the sum-rate of NOMA system. Numerical results show that NOMA system with limited feedback channel still gains larger system rate than traditional orthogonal multiple access system. It is also shown that random beamforming is more suitable for the NOMA system with limited CSI feedback.		Shimei Liu;Chao Zhang	2016	EURASIP J.

A systematic space partitioning method is proposed to divide the entire space into two decision regions using a set of hyperplanes. The resulting detector structure consists ofK parallel linear classifiers followed by aK-to-1 Boolean mapper, and is well suited to high-speed implementation. Compared to direct implementation of the fixed-delay tree search (FDTS) detection rule, the proposed signal-space formulation results in a considerable saving in digital hardware. Examples taken from binary-input intersymbol interference (ISI) channels are used to demonstrate the proposed technique. Block processing strategies suitable for high-speed applications are also discussed.	catastrophic interference;digital electronics;information sciences institute;interference (communication);multidimensional signal processing;space partitioning	Jaekyun Moon;Taehyun Jeon	1998	IEEE Trans.

The statistical properties of the lock detectors are derived theoretically using stochastic analysis, and computer simulations are used to validate the results obtained. The derivations yield discovery of two useful attributes of the lock detectors: 1) they are self-normalizing (or in other words signal-level independent) and 2) the channel E/sub S//N/sub 0/ can be readily ascertained from the lock metric when the receiver is in lock. Furthermore, a particularly simple hardware implementation for the lock metric computation process is found, which allows easy and efficient implementation of its computation within a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or application specified integrated circuit (ASIC). Analysis of the lock detectors' behavior under imperfect locking conditions is also discussed, and simulation results are presented. An overview is given of the applicability of the lock detectors to several related digital phase modulation schemes.	modulation;pre-shared key;sensor	Yair Linn;Nir Peleg	2004	IEEE Trans.

Although the Middleton class-A model and the Bernoulli-Gaussian model give good results to generate a sample distribution of impulsive noise, they fail in replicating the bursty behavior of impulsive noise, as encountered for instance within power substations. To deal with that, we adopt a two-state Markov-Gaussian process for the noise distribution. For this channel, we evaluate the bit error rate performance of direct transmission (DT) and a DF relaying scheme using M-ary phase shift keying (M-PSK) modulation in the presence of Rayleigh fading with a maximum a posteriori (MAP) receiver. From the obtained results, it is seen that the DF CR scheme in bursty impulsive noise channel still achieves the space diversity and performs significantly better than DT under the same power consumption. Moreover, the proposed MAP receiver attains the lower bound derived for DF CR scheme and leads to large performance gains compared with the conventional receiving criteria, which were optimized for additive white Gaussian noise channel and memoryless impulsive noise channel.	additive white gaussian noise;bernoulli polynomials;bit error rate;cooperative mimo;direction finding;gaussian process;interference (communication);key (cryptography);markov chain;mathematical model;modulation;multi-user mimo;performance;pre-shared key;profiling (computer programming);rayleigh fading;simulation;uninterruptible power supply;utility functions on indivisible goods	Md.

Diversity combining, such as space diversity, is a well-known method that can be used to alleviate the effects of these degradations. L-branch selection combining (SC) receiver which uses signal-tointerference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) power algorithm over correlated Rayleigh fading channels in the presence of Rayleigh distributed CCI and Gaussian noise is considered. The outage probability as significant performance criteria is analytically derived. The main contribution of this paper is that the analysis is carried out including the noise as a stochastic process, not only its average power value. The proposed mathematical analysis is complemented by various evaluation results showing the effects of the fading correlation as well as the number of diversity branches on the system’s performance. In addition, SC performance in interference-plusnoise environment is compared with performance in noiseand interference-limited environments.	algorithm;downtime;interference (communication);profiling (computer programming);rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;stochastic process	Nikola M.

Spectrum sensing is one of key functionalities enabling the opportunistic spectrum utilization for CR systems. The energy-based cooperative spectrum sensing is mostly adopted in current CR prototype systems due to the low complexity and high detection speed. The cooperative spectrum sensing performance is influenced by the number of collaborative CRs. However, the number of CRs is dynamically changing due to the dynamic behavior of public safety personnel. We study the dynamic behavior of CRs and also derive the exact analytical closed-form expressions for the sensing performance. These expressions lay the framework for utilizing the optimization tools to efficiently guarantee the global optimality for the system parameter design.	cognitive radio;interoperability;mathematical optimization;prototype	Chihkai Chen;Ralph E.

At the core of our system lies a novel concept of iterative self-reused equalisation/detection (bootstrapping) combined with semi-hard decision making. The bootstrapping concept is derived from a new formulation of Tikhonov Regularisation. The proposed scheme achieves a remarkable performance/complexity trade-off. In particular we show that our system approaches the performance of MLMIMO-OFDM while being only slightly more complex than MMSE-MIMO-OFDM. The coded version achieves virtually the same performance as Turbo MIMO-OFDM at a fraction of the complexity. The resulting system is termed Zero Tailed Bootstrap Frequency Equalised (ZTBFE) MIMO system.	adaptive equalizer;carrier frequency;complexity;fast fourier transform;global communications conference;iterative method;mimo;mimo-ofdm;multi-user;noise reduction;semiconductor industry;signal-to-noise ratio;xfig	Robert J.

In order to minimize the co-channel interference, we apply the multi-notch oblique projection polarization filters (OPPFs) to separate parallel streams at the same frequency at the receiver. Due to the polarization dependent loss effects of the narrow-band polarized channel, the pre-compensation method is proposed to mitigate the impairment of the signal-to-interference ratio in OPPFs. Whereas, the signal-to-noise of polarized channel would decrease after pre-compensation. Therefore, the optimal pre-compensation coefficient is calculated to obtain maximum capacity of the multiplexing system by signal to interference plus noise ratio. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of our design.	channel capacity;coefficient;interference (communication);mimo;multi-user;oblique projection;polarization (waves);polarizer;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectral efficiency;system analysis;transceiver;wavelength-division multiplexing	Xiaokai Zhang;Bangning Zhang;Daoxing Guo	2017	IEEE Wireless Communications Letters	10.1109/LWC.2017.2706272	statistical time division multiplexing;wi-fi array;spatial multiplexing;multiplexing;computer network	Mobile	46.06406997756062	83.34437240821312	37101

For transmission over the binary erasure channel, it was recently shown that spatial coupling increases the belief propagation threshold of the ensemble to essentially the maximum a priori threshold of the underlying component ensemble. This explains why convolutional LDPC ensembles, originally introduced by Felström and Zigangirov, perform so well over this channel. We show that the equivalent result holds true for transmission over general binary-input memoryless output-symmetric channels. More precisely, given a desired error probability and a gap to capacity, we can construct a spatially coupled ensemble that fulfills these constraints universally on this class of channels under belief propagation decoding. In fact, most codes in this ensemble have this property. The quantifier universal refers to the single ensemble/code that is good for all channels but we assume that the channel is known at the receiver. The key technical result is a proof that, under belief-propagation decoding, spatially coupled ensembles achieve essentially the area threshold of the underlying uncoupled ensemble. We conclude by discussing some interesting open problems.	belief propagation;binary erasure channel;graph coloring;low-density parity-check code;quantifier (logic);software propagation	Shrinivas Kudekar;Tom Richardson;Rüdiger L.

By considering Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) technique of LoRa, an approximation of the Bit Error Rate (BER) is presented and evaluated through intensive simulations. Unlike previous works which present the BER of LoRa in terms of the ratio of energy ber bit to noise ratio only without any proofing, our presented work expresses BER in terms of LoRa's modulation patterns such as the spreading factor, the code rate, the symbol frequency and the SNR. Numerical results are carried out in order to investigate the LoRa performance and to illustrate the accuracy of the new BER expression.	approximation;bit error rate;cascading style sheets;chirp;code rate;eb/n0;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;internet of things;modulation;noise power;numerical analysis;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectral density;x.690	H.

Users collaborate to form data-sharing groups, enabling them to clear interference within a group, while interference alignment is employed to clear interference between groups. To improve the capacity of our schemes at finite SNR, we propose that the groups of users invert their subchannel using a regularized Tikhonov inverse. We provide a new sleeker derivation of the optimal Tikhonov parameter, and use random matrix theory to provide an explicit formula for the SINR as the size of the system increases, which we believe is a new result. For every possible grouping of K = 4 users each with N = 5 antennas, we completely classify the degrees of freedom available to each user when using such hybrid schemes, and construct explicit interference alignment strategies which maximize the sum DoF. Lastly, we provide simulation results which compute the ergodic capacity of such schemes.	academy;digital subchannel;ergodicity;interference (communication);mimo;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	David A.

The nonstationary fading process can be characterized by assuming local stationarity for a region with finite extent in time and frequency. For this finite region, the wide-sense stationarity and uncorrelated scattering assumption approximately holds, and we are able to calculate a time-frequency-dependent local scattering function (LSF). In this paper, we estimate the LSF from a large set of measurements collected in the DRIVEWAY'09 measurement campaign, which focuses on scenarios for intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). We then obtain the time-frequency-varying power delay profile (PDP) and the time-frequency-varying Doppler power spectral density (DSD) from the LSF. Based on the PDP and the DSD, we analyze the time-frequency-varying root-mean-square (RMS) delay spread and the RMS Doppler spread. We show that the distribution of these channel parameters follows a bimodal Gaussian mixture distribution. High RMS delay spread values are observed in situations with rich scattering, whereas high RMS Doppler spreads are obtained in drive-by scenarios.	document structure description;frequency response;inline linking;lsf;mixture model;robertson–seymour theorem;spectral density;stationary process	Laura Bernadó;Thomas Zemen;Fredrik Tufvesson;Andreas F.

In this paper, a methodology is proposed to further simplify the complexity for the combination of CS and CD. Firstly, the relationship between spectral coherence function (SCF) and the compressed samples is deduced in matrix form, thus the reconstruction of original signal can be skipped. Secondly, we notice complexity is highly dependent on compression ratio, which is determined by signal sparsity. Through careful analysis, a strong dependence of sparsity on modulation mode and symbol rate is discovered. Therefore we propose to adjust compression ratio according to the modulation mode and symbol rate of the target signal. To facilitate the adjustment, a modulation classification algorithm based on correlation of SCF is formulated. Moreover, the relationship between compression ratio and performance loss is also explored. Simulation proves our method can reduce complexity significantly with marginal loss in accuracy.	adaptive algorithm;ampersand;canny edge detector;coherence (physics);complexity;compressed sensing;cyclostationary process;marginal model;modulation;simulation;sparse matrix	Xuan Fu;Ying Zhu;Jian Yang;Yifan Zhang;Zhiyong Feng	2015	2015 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2015.7127479	speech recognition;telecommunications	Mobile	51.79645723604066	81.92074784584925	37398

The resulting severe signal distortion calls for more sophisticated data detection algorithms. The near Maximum-Likelihood (ML) detection schemes proposed so far, either exhibit numerical instability issues at high SNRs or suffer from prohibitively high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a modified near-ML detection algorithm for the one-bit quantized case that eliminates the numerical issues with the lowest complexity among similar algorithms. We also present a low-complexity VLSI architecture for the proposed algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the FPGA implementation results of the proposed architecture and show that its complexity is similar to that of linear detectors, while significantly outperforms them from the symbol error rate (SER) performance perspective.	algorithm;multi-user mimo;very-large-scale integration	Dik Heg;Mahdi Shabany;Arash Amini;Mzuri H Davies	2018	2018 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2018.8351208	mimo;very-large-scale integration;field-programmable gate array;computer science;computational complexity theory;word error rate;distortion;numerical stability;algorithm;signal-to-noise ratio	Embedded	45.979777604278546	80.12384788775293	37469

The derived model is based on dynamic measurement data collected at a carrier frequency of 5.2 GHz in several typical indoor environments. Analysis shows that multiple births and deaths are possible at any instant of time. Furthermore, correlation exists between the number of births and deaths. Thus, an M-step, 4-state Markov channel model is proposed in order to account for these two effects. The spatio-temporal variations of paths within their lifespan are taken into consideration by the spatio-temporal vector which was found to be well-modeled by a Gaussian probability density function while the power variation can be modeled by a simple low pass filter. The implementation of the model is detailed and finally, the model validity is evaluated by comparing key statistics of the simulation results with the measurement results.	channel (communications)	Chia-Chin Chong;David I.

1bd9a9a74e873aafb64fbb6329e22683cdafecf8	performance of cloud radio networks		Cloud radio networks coordinate transmission among base stations (BSs) to reduce the interference effects, particularly for the cell-edge users. In this paper, we analyze the performance of a cloud network with static clustering where geographically close BSs form a cloud network of cooperating BSs. Because, of finite cooperation, the interference in a practical cloud radio cannot be removed and in this paper, the distance based interference is taken into account in the analysis. In particular, we consider centralized zero forcing equalizer and dirty paper precoding for cancelling the interference. Bounds are developed on the signal-to-interference ratio distribution and achievable rate with full and limited channel feedback from the cluster users. The adverse effect of finite clusters on the achievable rate is quantified. We show that, the number of cooperating BSs is more crucial than the cluster area when full channel state information form the cluster is available for precoding. Also, we study the impact of limiting the channel state information on the achievable rate. We show that even with a practically feasible feedback of about five to six channel states from each user, significant gain in mean rate and cell edge rate compared to conventional cellular systems can be obtained.	centralized computing;channel state information;cloud computing;cluster analysis;equalization (communications);interference (communication)	Sreejith T.

The merits of this new framework are demonstrated by two aspects: 1) Its (Shannon) capacity can be characterized by the causal conditional directed information. As an illustration, we characterize the n-block capacity of Gaussian noisy feedback channels under our new framework and propose an iteration algorithm to obtain a lower bound; 2) By constructing a specific linear coding scheme for the first-order moving average Gaussian channels with intermittent(erasure) feedback, we show that the new framework allows linear feedback coding schemes with positive transmission rate, which is (in certain scenario) much larger than the non-feedback Gaussian channel capacity.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;causal filter;causality;channel capacity;feedback;first-order predicate;information theory;iteration;iterative method;linear code;shannon (unit);transmitter	Chong Li;Nicola Elia	2012	2012 50th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)	10.1109/Allerton.2012.6483448	electronic engineering;theoretical computer science;control theory;mathematics;shannon–hartley theorem;channel capacity	ML	37.12825868175642	66.38216204292719	37500

However, in the uplink grant-free NOMA system, the current near-optimal multi-user detection (MUD) based on message passing algorithm (MPA) assumes that the user activity information is exactly known at the receiver, which is impractical yet challenging due to anyone of massive users can randomly enter or leave the system. In this paper, inspired by the observation of user sparsity, we jointly use compressive sensing (CS) and MPA to propose a CS-MPA detector to realize both user activity and data detection for uplink grant-free NOMA. Specifically, the MUD problem is firstly formulated under CS framework by exploiting user sparsity, and then user activity can be detected by sparse signal recovery algorithms in CS. Then, MPA can be performed to reliably detect active users' data. It is shown that the proposed CS-MPA detector with affordable complexity not only outperforms the conventional MPA detector without user activity information, but also achieves very close performance to the genie- knowledge MPA detector with exact knowledge of user activity, especially when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is high.	algorithm;compressed sensing;detection theory;genie;mud;message passing;multi-user;overhead (computing);randomness;shamash;signal-to-noise ratio;sparse matrix;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;x.690	Bichai Wang;Linglong Dai;Yifei Yuan;Zhaocheng Wang	2015	2015 IEEE 82nd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2015-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2015.7390876	detector;electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications link;telecommunications;engineering;interference	Mobile	44.89156460493169	86.52282355407705	37513

In contrast to previous works, where efforts were made to find a posteriori probabilities at the receiver, the BRC simply calculates the optimum weights, which depend on the channel's statistics, avoiding continuous channel estimation, and thus, it significantly reduces the system's complexity. In nonidentical multipath fading channels with power delay profile (PDP), the BRC receiver performs between maximal ratio combining (MRC) and equal gain combining (EGC), and keeps its performance comparable - and in some cases superior - to that of generalized selection combining, while for large values of the decay factor, it approaches MRC. Moreover, in the important practical case of exponential PDP - common in RAKE receivers modeling and adopted for the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System spatial channel modeling by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute-3GPP - the optimum weights can be accurately approximated by simple elementary functions. Furthermore, it is proved that the utilization of these weights ensures an error performance improvement over EGC for arbitrary PDPs. The proposed BRC receiver can be efficiently applied in wireless wideband communication systems, where a large number of diversity branches exists, due to the strong multipath effects.	approximation algorithm;bioinformatics resource centers;carrier recovery;channel state information;coherent;elementary function;generalized selection;maximal set;multipath propagation;rake;signal-to-noise ratio;time complexity	Athanasios S.

OFDM systems suffer from large variations in instantaneous peak power. Such transients distort the signals when they are passed through a nonlinear high power amplifier (HPA) prior to transmission. Existing companding systems are far from perfect since the receiver can not accurately estimate the degree of compression applied by the transmitter and thus can not regenerate the original signal by expansion; the key problems are the band pass filter (BPF), HPA, and the noise component enhanced by the channel compensation filter. In the proposed companding system, each symbol is divided into segments, and series of consecutive segments are grouped into clusters. Each cluster is multiplied by a weight equal to the inverse of the largest instantaneous power within the cluster. The receiver estimates the weight used for each time cluster. The weights for all clusters are averaged to mitigate the weight estimation error. As a result, the proposed expander can accurately estimate the weights used and thus well suppress the compression distortion.	companding	Osamu Takyu;Tomoaki Ohtsuki;Masao Nakagawa	2006	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietfec/e89-a.7.1884	telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering;companding;wireless	Mobile	48.8626639292886	81.20604937612724	37591

The analysis is carried out assuming channel state information known to both transmitter and receiver. The efficacy of the approach is based on the fact it yields computationally convenient and efficient results in log-normal fading environment. Based on TMGF, a simple closed form expression for higher order moments of channel capacity for log-normal channels is obtained when channel state information is only known to receiver. Numerical computation in relation to simulation results for varying value of $$\sigma _{ dB}$$?dB over permissible range are carried out to validate the accuracy of derived expressions.	channel capacity	Vineet Khandelwal;Karmeshu	2015	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-015-2353-y	mathematical optimization;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;channel capacity;statistics	Mobile	38.85334546264713	76.91323147094771	37620

The results are presented for both quasi-static and fast-fading conditions. We derive closed-form expressions for throughput, outage probability, and optimal power allocation optimizing the system throughput/outage probability. Finally, we complement the FSO link with an additional radio frequency (RF) link to create a hybrid RF-FSO system and reduce the system outage probability. The results show that joint implementation of the RF and FSO links leads to considerable performance improvement, compared to the cases with only FSO-based communication.

The codebook is designed with a feature of hierarchy, and can be organized into a binary tree, which makes the implementation of binary search possible. Meanwhile, based on the designed codebook, a suboptimal binary search like (BSL) algorithm is proposed for beamforming. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that, compared with the state-of-the-art search schemes, the proposed scheme dramatically decreases the search time.	beam search;codebook;search algorithm	Tong He;Zhenyu Xiao	2015	MONET	10.1007/s11036-015-0568-5	telecommunications;theoretical computer science;linde–buzo–gray algorithm;beamforming	Robotics	43.2859213040431	85.77637460796947	37753

A semi-blind beamforming algorithm based on a least-squares (LS) approximation for constant modulus signals leads to a relatively simple and practical receiver that suppresses cochannel interference (CCI). In order to further improve the receiver performance, filtered training sequences are used to compensate for the phase offsets of the cochannel GMSK signals. Computer simulations demonstrate that this hybrid algorithm improves the receiver performance, whereby the beampattern nulls suppress the CCI affecting the coded data of the TDMA bursts.	adaptive beamformer;approximation;beamforming;hybrid algorithm;interference (communication);key (cryptography);least squares;modulation;modulus of continuity;sampling (signal processing);semiconductor industry;simulation;x.690	Myung-Hoon Yeon;John J.

An In-band spectrum sensing method based on linear self-signal elimination is proposed. In this method, quiet period is not needed so that transmission performance can be improved without the interruption of on-going transmission. According to the AR model of the wireless fading channel, the adjacent symbols are linear weighted to eliminate the self-signal. Further the optimal detector under Neyman-Pearson criterion is used on the residual signal after self-signal elimination to provide better detection performance. Finally, performance is evaluated with simulations which show that our method can provide better performance in the IEEE802.22 environment.	autoregressive model;cognitive radio;interrupt;simulation;throughput	Dong Chen;Jiandong Li;Jing Ma	2008	2008 IEEE 19th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2008.4699903	telecommunications;computer science;fading;statistics;computer network	Embedded	48.24952372193103	85.90462266643311	37897

One of the major limitations of massive MIMO is the cost of a huge number of RF chains. Antenna Selection is a promising signal processing technique which reduces the number of required RF chains while keeping the system's performance at a certain minimum level. In this paper, we investigate the capacity performance of an antenna selection scheme employed in a massive MISO system. The main contribution of this paper is a theorem which provides a concise formula for the limiting normalized channel power gain in the considered scheme. The deterministic equivalent of the normalized channel power gain is valid in the regime when the number of RF chains, Nc, and the number of base station antennas, NT, tend to infinity while maintaining fixed ratio β = Nc/NT. Numerical experiments suggest that the deterministic equivalents are accurate even for relatively small Nc, NT.	beamforming;experiment;mimo;markov chain;nc (complexity);power gain;radio frequency;signal processing;system analysis;telecommunications link;windows nt 4.0	Stephen V.

Thereby, two problems occur. First, due to OFDM, the transmit signal exhibits a large peak-to-average power ratio (PAR). Second, the multi-user interferences have to be equalized (or precoded) at the transmitter side. In this article, we address combined precoding and PAR reduction. As precoding schemes sorted Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (sTHP) and its latticereduction-aided variant (LRA-THP) are considered. In order to reduce the PAR, we review the scheme selected sorting (SLS), which is a combined approach of PAR reduction and precoding with sTHP. Based on this idea, the novel PAR reduction scheme selected basis (SLB) is introduced which combines PAR reduction with the precoding approach LRA-THP. It can be shown that SLB achieves very good PAR reduction performance and hardly influences the error performance. Both schemes, SLB and SLS, are compared with simplified selected mapping (sSLM), the only PAR reduction scheme from the SLM family, which can be applied in multi-user downlink scenarios. The comparison is done on the basis that the respective schemes exhibit the same computational complexity. In terms of PAR reduction performance, it turns out that sSLM outperforms SLS, whereas the performance of sSLM and SLB is similar. Noteworthy, the great benefit of SLB or SLS is that no side information has to be communicated to the receiver as it is necessary with sSLM. Moreover, using SLB, full diversity error rate performance is possible with only low-PAR transmit signals.	computational complexity theory;itil;lattice reduction;multi-user;regular expression;sorting;standard sea level;telecommunications link;transmitter	Christian Siegl;Robert F.

474854b748f054ef5222cccd46bced92040096e2	a flip-syndrome-list polar decoder architecture for ultra-low-latency communications		We consider practical hardware implementation of Polar decoders. To reduce latency due to the serial nature of successive cancellation (SC), existing optimizations improve parallelism with two approaches, i.e., multi-bit decision or reduced path splitting. In this paper, we combine the two procedures into one with an error-pattern-based architecture. It simultaneously generates a set of candidate paths for multiple bits with pre-stored patterns. For rate-1 (R1) or single parity-check (SPC) nodes, we prove that a small number of deterministic patterns are required to guarantee performance preservation. For general nodes, low-weight error patterns are indexed by syndrome in a look-up table and retrieved in O(1) time. The proposed flip-syndrome-list (FSL) decoder fully parallelizes all constituent code blocks without sacrificing performance, thus is suitable for ultra-low-latency applications. Meanwhile, two code construction optimizations are presented to further reduce complexity and improve performance, respectively.

Many approaches have been proposed to lower the error floor by designing new LDPC codes with fewer such substructures or by modifying the decoding algorithm. Using a theoretical analysis of iterative MP decoding in an idealized trapping set scenario, we show that a contributor to the error floors observed in the literature may be the imprecise implementation of decoding algorithms and, in particular, the message quantization rules used. We then propose a new quantization method - (q+1)-bit quasi-uniform quantization - that efficiently increases the dynamic range of messages, thereby overcoming a limitation of conventional quantization schemes. Finally, we use the quasi-uniform quantizer to decode several LDPC codes that suffer from high error floors with traditional fixed-point decoder implementations. The performance simulation results provide evidence that the proposed quantization scheme can, for a wide variety of codes, significantly lower error floors with minimal increase in decoder complexity.	algorithm;code (cryptography);code word;cognitive dimensions of notations;dynamic range;error floor;graph (abstract data type);iterative method;low-density parity-check code;message passing;performance prediction;qr code;quantization (signal processing);simulation;tanner graph	Xiaojie Zhang;Paul H.

One promising approach to increasing mmWave connectivity and range is to use relays. Device-to-device (D2D) communications open the door to the vast opportunities of D2D relaying for mmWave cellular systems. In this paper, we study how to select a good relay for a given source-destination pair in a two-hop mmWave cellular system, where the mmWave links are subject to random Bernoulli blockages. In such a system, probing more relays could potentially lead to the discovery of a better relay but at the cost of more overhead. We find that the throughput-optimal relay probing strategy is a pure threshold policy: The system can stop relay probing once the achievable spectral efficiency of the currently probed two-hop link exceeds an optimized threshold. We further characterize the optimal spectral efficiency threshold via a fixed-point equation.	bernoulli polynomials;direction finding;heuristic;multi-user;overhead (computing);relay;spectral efficiency;throughput	Ning Wei;Xingqin Lin;Zhongpei Zhang	2016	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2016.2552239	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	Mobile	30.093485462203635	85.15373010126862	37993
8d310f77c49db28fba5abcdc2ae50cde5dd07453	short message noisy network coding with rate splitting		For noisy network with multiple relays, short message noisy network coding with rate splitting (SNNC-RS) scheme is presented. It has recently been shown by Hou and Kramer that mixed cooperative strategies in which relays in favorable positions decode-and-forward (DF) and the rest quantize via short message noisy network coding (SNNC) can outperform existing cooperative strategies (e.g., noisy network coding (NNC) and decode-and-forward). A drawback of such schemes is that forwarding of quantized signals at SNNC relays introduces interference to the rest of the relays. Our proposed relaying scheme has a capability to reduce such interference and thereby improve the rate performance. In the proposed scheme, superposition coding is incorporated into SNNC encoding to enable partial interference cancellation at DF relays. The achievable rate with proposed scheme is derived for the discrete two-relay network and evaluated in the Gaussian case where gains over the rate achievable without rate splitting are demonstrated.	direction finding;interference (communication);kramer graph;linear network coding;quantization (signal processing);relay	Ivana Maric;Dennis Hui	2014	CoRR		speech recognition;telecommunications;computer science	Networks	34.391118210376966	75.58203409851345	38087

The core idea of the proposed method is to align interference signals over time at the unintended receivers in a distributed manner. With the proposed method, trade-off regions between the sum of degrees of freedom (sum-DoF) and feedback delay of CSI are characterized in both the X channel and three-user interference channel to reveal the impact on on how the CSI feedback delay affects the sum-DoF of the interference networks. A major implication of derived results is that distributed and moderatelydelayed CSIT is useful to obtain strictly better the sum-DoF over the case of no CSI at the transmitter in a certain class of interference networks. For a class of X channels, the results show how to optimally use distributed and moderately-delayed CSIT to yield the same sum-DoF as instantaneous and global CSIT. Further, leveraging the proposed transmission method and the known outer bound results, the ergodic sum-capacity of the twouser X channel is characterized within a constant bit.	align (company);channel state information;ergodicity;interference (communication);transmitter	Namyoon Lee;Ravi Tandon;Robert W.

We characterize the performance of our proposed strategy mathematically. We derive an approximated expression for the second largest eigenvalue in order to characterize the convergence rate. Our results show the impact of fading on network consensus. They furthermore indicate that the proposed technique can improve the consensus performance considerably.	approximation algorithm;rate of convergence;stochastic matrix	Mehrzad Malmirchegini;Yongxiang Ruan;Yasamin Mostofi	2008	IEEE GLOBECOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.939	mathematical optimization;computer science;theoretical computer science;control theory;mathematics;fading;statistics	Embedded	40.01805193327888	72.65834025862914	38105

The quality of synthesis is measured by total variation distance between the synthesized and desired statistics. The proposed layered and successive encoding scheme relies on the learned structure of tree to use minimal number of common random variables to synthesize the desired density. We characterize the achievable rate region for the rate tuples of multi-layer latent Gaussian tree, through which the number of bits needed to simulate such Gaussian joint density are determined. The random sources used in our algorithm are the latent variables at the top layer of tree, the additive independent Gaussian noises, and the Bernoulli sign inputs that capture the ambiguity of correlation signs between the variables.	algorithm;bernoulli polynomials;gaussian elimination;latent variable;layer (electronics);line code;simulation;tree structure;utility functions on indivisible goods	Ali Moharrer;Shuangqing Wei;George T.

To achieve this theoretical capacity, the constituent parallel subchannels arising from the MIMO channel have to be properly used. Many practical schemes are being currently developed to achieve this goal. In this paper, we first show that, from an information-theoretic point of view, beamforming becomes asymptotically optimal as the spatial correlation of the channel fading increases. In light of this result, wideband beamvectors are jointly derived for both transmission and reception. We allow a controlled partial response and design zero-forcing and minimum mean–squared error transmit–receive filters. Conceptually, the beamforming scheme is shown to decompose into two stages: the first one corresponds to a spatial flattening of the MIMO channel, i.e., choosing the subchannel with the highest gain at each frequency; the second stage depends on the particular design criterion and performs a power distribution at the transmitter and defines the equalizer at the receiver. These methods are further extended to the general case of multiple beamforming, i.e., when more than one subchannel are used. An exact and practical implementation of a modified “waterfilling” solution required for the filter design is proposed. All derived methods are assessed and compared in terms of capacity and bit-error rate.	asymptotically optimal algorithm;beamforming;bit error rate;digital subchannel;equalization (communications);filter design;information theory;mimo;transmitter;zero-forcing precoding	Daniel Pérez Palomar;Miguel Angel Lagunas	2003	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2003.810324	zero forcing equalizer;minimum mean square error;spatial correlation;index term;bit error rate;telecommunications;space-time adaptive processing;computer science;space time;control theory;mathematics;filter design;radio receiver;precoding;channel capacity;statistics;mimo	Networks	40.94677264934696	71.96246904694821	38256

In this paper, we argue and show that the time-reversal (TR) signal transmission is an ideal paradigm for green wireless communications because of its inherent nature to fully harvest energy from the surrounding environment by exploiting the multi-path propagation to re-collect all the signal energy that would have otherwise been lost in most existing communication paradigms. A green wireless technology must ensure low energy consumption and low radio pollution to others than the intended user. In this paper, we show through theoretical analysis, numerical simulations and experiment measurements that the TR wireless communications, compared to the conventional direct transmission using a Rake receiver, reveals significant transmission power reduction, achieves high interference alleviation ratio, and exhibits large multi-path diversity gain. As such it is an ideal paradigm for the development of green wireless systems. The theoretical analysis and numerical simulations show an order of magnitude improvement in terms of transmit power reduction and interference alleviation. Experimental measurements in a typical indoor environment also demonstrate that the transmit power with TR based transmission can be as low as 20% of that without TR, and the average radio interference (thus radio pollution) even in a nearby area can be up to 6dB lower. A strong time correlation is found to be maintained in the multi-path channel even when the environment is varying, which indicates high bandwidth efficiency can be achieved in TR radio communications.	computer simulation;image resolution;interference (communication);multipath propagation;numerical analysis;programming paradigm;radio broadcasting;rake;software propagation;spectral efficiency;t-symmetry;transistor;transmitter	Beibei Wang;Yongle Wu;Feng Han;Yu-Han Yang;K.

Virtual carriers in an OFDM symbol cause orthogonality loss in DFT-based channel estimation, which is referred to as the leakage problem. In order to solve the leakage problem, optimal and suboptimal methods have already been proposed. However, according to our analysis, the performance of these methods highly depends on the coherence bandwidth of wireless channels. If some of the estimated channel frequency responses are placed outside the coherence bandwidth, a channel estimation error occurs and the entire performance worsens in spite of a high signal-to-noise ratio.	channel state information;discrete fourier transform;frequency divider;frequency response;multiplexing;performance;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral leakage;subcarrier;zero suppression	Junhui Zhao;Rong Ran;Chang-Heon Oh;Jeong Wook Seo	2014	J.

OSTBCs, however, can only be designed for certain numbers of transmit antennas. Channel-dependent linear precoders have been proposed to overcome this deficiency, but it is not clear what conditions the precoder design must satisfy to guarantee full diversity order. In this letter, we show necessary and sufficient conditions for linear precoded OSTBCs to provide full diversity order. We show that limited feedback precoding can achieve full diversity order using fewer bits than limited feedback beamforming. We also present a simplified version of antenna subset selection for OSTBCs that can provide full diversity order with low complexity and only a small amount of feedback.	angular defect;beamforming;code;feedback;rayleigh fading	David James Love;Robert W.

With M antennas at both transmitter and receiver nodes, the Interference Alignment (IA) scheme [1] was shown to provide 1/2 SpAC (Symbols transmitted per transmit Antenna per Channel use) per user, whereas, the Fractional Interference Alignment (FIA) scheme [2] provides a value of SpAC in the range [0,1]. When FA signals are used, the IA technique which uses a fixed value of SpAC = 1/2 is sub-optimal, and therefore will not provide the best possible rate and/or bit error rate (BER). Instead, the FIA scheme explicitly computes the maximum SpAC that can be supported for the interference channel model (assuming that accurate knowledge of the channel state information is available for the desired and the interfering signals). Hence, based on two different optimization criteria, namely (a) Coding Gain (CG) maximization, and (b) Goodput (GP) maximization, we use a simple conjugate gradient search approach to compute the sub-optimal SpAC value and the corresponding precoders for the FIA scheme. Numerical results show that for a 3 user IC, even at finite signal-to-interference ratio (SIR), (M1)/M SpAC (upper bound in FIA scheme) is achieved, as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) tends to infinity. The BER performance is also compared between CG and GP maximization problems. Finally, the BER performance of these two optimization schemes are compared with the IA scheme, where it is shown that the proposed FIA with CG criterion outperforms the IA scheme, and will provide 0.7 dB SNR gain for the same rate.	bit error rate;catastrophic interference;cg (programming language);channel (communications);channel state information;channel use;coding gain;conjugate gradient method;emoticon;expectation–maximization algorithm;goodput;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;scart;signal-to-noise ratio;statistical interference;transmitter;x.690	B.

The efficiency of the compression codes can be estimated by three characteristics: 1) the redundancy (r), defined as the maximal difference between the average codeword length and Shannon entropy in case the letters are generated by a Bernoulli source; 2) the size (in bits) of the encoder and the encoder programs (S) when implemented on a computer; and 3) the average time required for encoding and decoding of a single letter (T). He investigates S and T as a function of r when r/spl rarr/0. All known methods may be divided into two classes. The Ziv-Lempel codes and their variants fall under the first class, and the arithmetic code with the Lynch-Davisson code fall under the second one. The codes from the first class need exponential memory size S=0(exp(1/r)) for redundancy r when r/spl rarr/O. The methods from the second class have a small memory size but a low encoding speed: S=0(1/r/sup const/), T=0(log/sup const/(1/r) log log (1/r)). In this paper, the author presents a code that combines the merits of both classes; the memory size is small and the speed is high: S=0(1/r/sup const/),T=0(log/sup const/(1/r) log log (1/r)). >		Boris Ryabko	1994	IEEE Trans.

The analysis takes into consideration attenuations due to atmospheric turbulence, geometric spread and pointing errors at the same time. We derive, in generalized infinite power series expressions, the tight upper and lower bounds of the overall outage probability and average probability of errors of the system. The study finds that this two-way subcarrier intensity-modulated AF relaying system using a binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation could be used for practical applications in case of a weak turbulence regime in which the required SNR is about 30 dB to obtain the average bit error probability of 10-6. It is also noted that the pointing errors clearly degrade the performance of the two-way subcarrier intensity-modulated AF relaying system.	anisotropic filtering;bit error rate;downtime;key (cryptography);modulation;signal-to-noise ratio;subcarrier;turbulence	Jaedon Park;Chan-Byoung Chae;Gi-Wan Yoon	2017	Journal of Communications and Networks	10.1109/JCN.2017.000080	modulation;subcarrier;attenuation;computer science;phase-shift keying;real-time computing;control theory;free-space optical communication;adaptive optics;upper and lower bounds;communication channel	Mobile	38.96396645058575	78.30124006249812	38696

The most popular criterion for linear beamforming is the minimum mean square error (MMSE). However, the mean square error (MSE) cost function is not optimal in terms of the bit error probability performance of the system. A class of adaptive beamforming algorithms has been proposed based on minimizing the bit error rate (BER) cost function directly. Unfortunately, the popular least minimum BER (LMBER) stochastic beamforming algorithm suffers from low convergence speed. Gradient Newton algorithms have been proposed to speed up the convergence rate and enhance performance but at the expense of complexity. In this paper, a block processing objective function for the minimum BER (MBER) is formulated, and a nonlinear optimization strategy, which produces the so-called block-Shanno MBER (BSMBER), is developed. A complete discussion for the complexity calculations of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated. Simulation scenarios are carried out in a multipath Rayleigh-fading direct-sequence code-division multiple access (DS-CDMA) system to explore the performance of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm offers good performance in terms of convergence speed, steady-state performance, and even system capacity compared to other MBER- and MSE-based algorithms.	algorithm;beamforming;bit error rate;channel capacity;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;gradient;iteration;linear programming;loss function;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;multipath propagation;newton;newton's method;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;optimization problem;rate of convergence;rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;smart antenna;software propagation;speedup;steady state;x.690	Tamer A.

The Reyleigh fading channel propagation condition is assumed. In this case, the optimum transmission consists of allocating the transmitted power for each virtual sub-channel related to the corresponding eigenvalue of the channel matrix. The optimum power allocation is computed using the water pouring algorithm (WPA). However, a real-time implementation of the algorithm requires serious computational work, which is O(M t ). We propose a modification to WPA that reduces the computational complexity to O(Mt).	algorithm;channel state information;computation;computational complexity theory;mimo;real-time clock;software propagation;transmitter;whole earth 'lectronic link;wi-fi protected access	Viktor Zaharov;Houssain Kettani	2009			computer science;mimo;fading;computer network;channel state information;precoding;water filling algorithm;3g mimo;multi-user mimo;topology;water-pouring algorithm	Networks	39.7004267721902	87.63183596735205	38736
255a227dd2546eb39d09c7a05b9e547fe01f8629	a two-stage receiver with soft interference cancellation for space-time block code and spatial multiplexing combined systems	soft interference cancellation;stbc;space time block code;spatial multiplexing;sm;mimo;soft decision;gsc based detectors;mu downlink	This paper presents a new space–time two-stage receiver with the assistance of soft information for the Alamouti space–time block code (STBC) and spatially multiplexing (SM) combined multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which possess both the advantages of high diversity gain and high data rates to entail the next generation wireless communication systems. The first stage of the receiver, utilizing the inherent structure of the STBC, consists of a bank of soft generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC)-based detectors, each for every STBC block, and intends to yield a more precise initial estimate of the transmitted symbols. In the second stage, the groupwise detection is conducted successively by using the matched filters (MFs) to simultaneously detect the two consecutive symbols in one STBC block with the removal of the soft interferences in between. Since the interferences have been faithfully reproduced and thoroughly annihilated, the new receiver can yield accurate symbol detection even with simple MFs. Moreover, some extreme cases regarding the soft information employed in the new receiver and its extension to the multiuser (MU) MIMO downlink are addressed as well. Conducted simulations show that the developed receiver, with modest computational load, can provide superior performance compared with pervious works, especially in the MU MIMO downlink.

Desired signal and interferers are subject to flat Rayleigh fading, and the propagation channels are independent. An approximate expression of the probability density function of the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is derived analytically. It is then applied to obtain the cumulative distribution function of the SINR, and the bit-error rate (BER) of some binary modulations, including coherent binary phaseshift keying. In the case of a single interferer, an exact analysis is performed to prove the validity of the approximation. In the case of multiple interferers, the accuracy of the approximation is assessed through simulations. Although limited to equipower interferers, this analysis is a convenient way of assessing the performance of optimum combining in some typical situations and comparing it with that of maximal-ratio combining. The final results are remarkably simple and provide a useful complement to previous analyzes, especially in the region of reasonably high BER’s which are of practical interest.	approximation algorithm;bit error rate;coherence (physics);interference (communication);key (cryptography);maximal set;profiling (computer programming);rayleigh fading;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;software propagation;x.690	Eric Villier	1999	IEEE Trans.

We derive a simple analytic expression for the iterative belief propagation (BP) decoding threshold of a randomly punctured LDPC code ensemble on the binary erasure channel (BEC) and show that, with respect to the BP threshold, the strength and suitability of an LDPC code ensemble for random puncturing is completely determined by a single constant that depends only on the rate and the BP threshold of the mother code ensemble. We then provide an efficient way to accurately predict BP thresholds of randomly punctured LDPC code ensembles on the binary-input additive white Gaussian noise channel (BI-AWGNC), given only the BP threshold of the mother code ensemble on the BEC and the design rate, and we show how the prediction can be improved with knowledge of the BI-AWGNC threshold. We also perform an asymptotic minimum distance analysis of randomly punctured code ensembles and present simulation results that confirm the robust decoding performance promised by the asymptotic results. Protograph-based LDPC block code and spatially coupled LDPC code ensembles are used throughout as examples to demonstrate the results.		David G. M.

A coarser description of the statistical behavior of (X, Y) is given by the marginal distributions PX, PY and the adjacency relation induced by the joint distribution, where x and y are adjacent if P(x, y) > 0. We derive a lower bound on the mutual information in terms of these entities. The bound is obtained by viewing the channel from X to Y as a probability distribution on a set of possible actions, where an action determines the output for any possible input, and is independently drawn. We also provide an alternative proof based on convex optimization that yields a generally tighter bound. Finally, we derive an upper bound on the mutual information in terms of adjacency events between the action and the pair (X, Y), where in this case, an action a and a pair (x, y) are adjacent if y = a(x). As an example, we apply our bounds to the binary deletion channel and show that for the special case of an independent identically distributed input distribution and a range of deletion probabilities, our lower and upper bounds both outperform the best known bounds for the mutual information.	convex optimization;deletion channel;entity;graph (discrete mathematics);marginal model;mathematical optimization;mutual information;pixel;python	Or Ordentlich;Ofer Shayevitz	2016	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2016.2609390	convex function;probability distribution;random variable;entropy;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;uncertainty;mathematics;mutual information;joint probability distribution;upper and lower bounds;conditional mutual information;statistics	ML	36.026769626864265	65.69572910148185	38817

A similar result appears in the context of multiuser channels where multiuser diversity gain is achieved by serving users with the strongest channels. In contrast, in this paper, we exploit opportunistic channel selection to reduce the processing energy at the receiver side. This saving is derived by increasing the gap between the instantaneous capacity and the code rate, which in turn reduces the required decoding energy. The savings in the processing energy then enables the receiver to sample and process a larger fraction of the packets. We first analyze the single-user case, and propose a signaling scheme that achieves the optimum rate. We then extend this result to a multiuser system.	code rate;multi-user	Hajar Mahdavi-Doost;Roy D.

Though ICI caused by Doppler spread is negligible in femtocell systems, frequent reception of signals over misaligned subcarriers will introduce severe ICI. Successive interference cancellation and decision feedback equalizers are some of the techniques proposed to mitigate ICI. However, most of these methods are highly complex, and thus, not suitable for commercial femtocell systems. In this paper, a simple equalization technique to reduce ICI in OFDMA based femtocell networks is proposed. It has been designed particularly considering the femtocell system's operating environment and their limited computational capacity. This technique provides excellent ICI reduction performance for smaller delay spreads of the users.	catastrophic interference;equalization (communications);frequency divider;hierarchical data format;ici (programming language);interference (communication);machine-readable dictionary;microsoft robotics developer studio;operating environment;recursion (computer science);subcarrier;x.690	Amila P.

We propose an enhancement to the MAX-LOG-MAP algorithm by adding a traceback operation similar to that used in the Viterbi algorithm, and devise a new efficient way to initialize the start state of the traceback. This enhancement is effective for each decoding iteration, and provides saving on top of existing techniques such as early termination and memory optimizations. It reduces the computational complexity by an additional 15%, without incurring any performance penalty.	computational complexity theory;finite-state machine;iteration;max;mobile device;principal component analysis;turbo code;viterbi algorithm	Curt Schurgers;Anantha Chandrakasan	2004	2004 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2004.1326909	list decoding;turbo code;soft output viterbi algorithm;convolutional code;real-time computing;sequential decoding;viterbi algorithm;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;serial concatenated convolutional codes;berlekamp–welch algorithm;error floor;iterative viterbi decoding;statistics	Robotics	44.61587194024127	64.65935747609264	38999

In this case, the transfer function for each subcarrier is a Fourier transform of the channel impulse response. However, if the guard interval is shorter than the maximum channel delay, it is not true any more, and intersymbol and interchannel interferences from adjacent OFDM symbols and subchannels must be taken into account. In this paper, we re-visit the transfer function of two equivalent implementations of OFDM systems operating in multipath channels with a generalized guard interval, which could be shorter or longer than the maximum channel delay, and evaluate the impact of interferences on the link performance in terms of signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio.	dispersive partial differential equation;interference (communication);multipath propagation;multiplexing;signal-to-noise ratio;subcarrier;transfer function	Wookwon Lee	2004	2004 IEEE International Conference on Communications (IEEE Cat.

The concept of peeling decoder and stopping sets is generalized to NBLDPC codes. Using these generalizations, a combinatorial characterization of decoding failures of NBLDPC codes is given, under assumption that the Belief Propagation (BP) decoder is used. Then, the residual ensemble of codes resulted by the BP decoder is defined and the design rate and the expectation of total number of codewords of the residual ensemble are computed. The decoding failure criterion combined with the density evolution analysis helps us to compute the asymptotic residual degree distribution for NBLDPC codes. Our approach to compute the residual degree distribution on the check node side is not efficient as it is based on enumeration of all the possible connections on the check node side which satisfy the decoding failure criterion. So, the computation of the asymptotic check node side residual degree distribution and further part of our analysis is performed for NBLDPC codes over GF2m with m = 2 . In order to show that asymptotically almost every code in such LDPC ensemble has a rate equal to the design rate, we generalize the argument of the Maxwell construction to NBLDPC codes, defined over GF22. It is also observed that, like in the binary setting, the Maxwell construction, relating the performance of MAP and BP decoding holds in this setting.	belief propagation;binary erasure channel;code word;computation;degree distribution;low-density parity-check code;map;maxwell (microarchitecture);qr code	Vishwambhar Rathi;Iryna Andriyanova	2011	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2011.2110930	block code;list decoding;concatenated error correction code;entropy;binary code;binary erasure channel;combinatorics;low-density parity-check code;asymptotic analysis;error detection and correction;degree distribution;bipartite graph;sequential decoding;theoretical computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;linear code;mathematics;error floor;algorithm;statistics;belief propagation;satisfiability	Theory	39.83512186979939	61.23068887531168	39093

We consider the comb-type subcarriers assignment for a resource block. According to the Orthogonality theorem, the dedicated resource block assigned to the user is demultiplexed by multiplying the associated coefficient. This approach is less computational complexity compared to fast Fourier transform(FFT) scheme. The inter-symbol interference(ISI) resulted from multipath fading channel is compensated in the time domain. To avoid complex high-order matrix inversion, pairwise subcarriers allocation and equalization are suggested. Computer simulations and complexity comparisons are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed time domain equalization and detection schemes. The proposed schemes are shown to be feasible and remarkable reduction in computational complexity is disclosed.	adobe framemaker;coefficient;committed information rate;compaq lte;computational complexity theory;fast fourier transform;frequency divider;multipath propagation;scheme;sensor;simulation;subcarrier;telecommunications link;time complexity	Chia-Horng Liu	2010	2010 IEEE 71st Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2010.5493932	computer simulation;fast fourier transform;electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications link;telecommunications;time domain;computer science;theoretical computer science;interference;computational complexity theory;frequency domain;fading	EDA	48.35944488146128	80.39886506504214	39104

In such a network without direct link between user 1 and user 2, there exist six possible transmission modes, i.e., four point-to-point modes (user 1-to-relay, user 2-to-relay, relay-to-user 1, relay-to-user 2), a multiple access mode (both users to the relay), and a broadcast mode (the relay to both users). Because of the buffering capability at the relay, the transmissions in the network are not restricted to adhere to a predefined schedule, and therefore, all the transmission modes in the bidirectional relay network can be used adaptively based on the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) of the involved links. For the considered network, assuming fixed transmit powers for both the users and the relay, we derive the optimal transmission mode selection policy which maximizes the sum rate. The proposed policy selects one out of the six possible transmission modes in each time slot based on the instantaneous CSI. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed protocol compared to existing protocols.	channel state information;existential quantification;inline linking;point-to-point protocol;relay;simulation	Vahid Jamali;Nikola Zlatanov;Aïssa Ikhlef;Robert Schober	2013	21st European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO 2013)		link access procedure for frame relay;telecommunications;mathematics;relay channel;computer network	Mobile	33.359273021115996	78.11338080913467	39118

This property is most useful when estimating the phase noise spectrum directly from digitally-modulated signals because those signals are typically accompanied by various kinds of undesired noise that easily mask the phase noise of interest. A frequency-domain estimation method based on complementary spectrum is presented for practical computation of phase noise spectrum. For the method, a formula for the noise suppression factor is derived assuming the properness in noise. Furthermore, suppressibility analyses are conducted, which reveal that many of the noises associated with modulated signals are indeed proper, and can thus be suppressed. Numerical simulations demonstrate the method, and verify the noise suppression factor. It is believed that this technique is the first of its kind being able to extract phase noise spectrum while suppressing many other kinds of noise.	autocorrelation;colors of noise;common access card;computation;modulation;newton's method;numerical linear algebra;phase noise;simulation;spectral density estimation;zero suppression	Koji Harada	2014	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2014.2336606	speech recognition;mathematics;phase noise;statistics	EDA	51.219738886839714	82.17752343860546	39182

The proposed signal design concatenates some OFDM symbols without guard interval and adds one CP per the concatenated symbols. Obviously, the proposed CP design results in severe inter-symbol-interference and inter-carrier-interference when we apply the conventional OFDM demodulation to the received signal. In order to combat them, we introduce the frequency domain equalization technique with the maximum ratio combining, zero forcing and Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) filters. By computer simulations, we show that the proposed system with the MMSE filter owing to the diversity effect outperforms the conventional one.	adobe framemaker;approximation algorithm;computer simulation;concatenation;error detection and correction;forward error correction;ici (programming language);interference (communication);multiplexing	Masahiro Fujii;Yuta Kasajima;Hiroyuki Hatano;Atsushi Ito;Yu Watanabe	2014	2014 International Symposium on Information Theory and its Applications		theoretical computer science;computer science;equalization (audio);cyclic prefix;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing	Arch	47.42166732812475	79.50217260742929	39215

Channel impulse responses (CIRs) are measured in the frequency band of 3 GHz to 4.6 GHz in four different classrooms. For each measurement site, the proportion of occupied seats is changed to observe the effect of the number of people on the wireless propagation channel. First, path-loss exponents are calculated from the measurement data. After that, using Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT), CIRs are derived. Based on the CIRs, the comparison among the bit error rate performance, partial Rake receiver, and selective Rake receiver are investigated. The result shows that the human body effect including changes of population on UWB channel should be considered when the performances of UWB communication system are evaluated.	bit error rate;fast fourier transform;frequency band;performance;rake;signal-to-noise ratio;software propagation;ultra-wideband;x.690	Jae-Hyun Lee;Young-Hoon Kim;Seong-Cheol Kim	2015	2015 IEEE 82nd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2015-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2015.7390983	electronic engineering;bit error rate;telecommunications;gain;engineering;electrical engineering;mathematics;bandwidth;statistics	Mobile	41.46693363821458	77.3424797423521	39217

High speed Viterbi decoders for convolutional codes are of great interest for high data rate applications. In this paper, an improved most-significant-bit (MSB)-first bit-level pipelined add-compare select (ACS) unit structure is proposed. The ACS unit is the main bottleneck on the decoding speed of a Viterbi decoder. By balancing the settling time of different paths in the ACS unit, the length of the critical path is reduced as close as possible to the iteration bound in the ACS unit. With the proposed retimed structure, it is possible to decrease the critical path of the ACS unit by 12 to 15% compared with the conventional MSB-first structures. This reduction in critical path can reduce the level of parallelism (and area) required for a very highspeed (such as 10 Gbps) Viterbi decoder by about 25%.	bit-level parallelism;convolutional code;critical path method;data rate units;error detection and correction;iteration;most significant bit;parallel computing;pipeline (computing);settling time;uncompressed video;viterbi algorithm;viterbi decoder	Keshab K.

3e3cdb33ffface7c99b9a842899c96dfce089124	detecting primary signals using time and space model		The advantage of using cognitive radio technology is its ability to adapt and behave to the needs of the application. The adaptability to the application leads cognitive radios with the potential for creating next generation cognitive wireless network. In dynamic spectrum allocation problem, the cognitive radio technology is used to detect the presence of primary user signal so that spectrum will be efficiently utilized by cognitive users (secondary users). To detect the presence of primary user, cognitive radio requires the data related to history of primary signal including time, signal strength (signal will be detected above certain threshold) through detection techniques (energy detectors, matched filter, feature detection, etc.), and finally analyze this data to detect the signal without failure. In this research, a stochastic model is used to detect the primary signal at a given time and space (primary signal decodable area or domain). The proposed time-space model uses Drake’s equation to improve the detection of primary signal.	cognitive network;cognitive radio;feature detection (computer vision);feature detection (web development);frequency allocation;matched filter;next-generation network;sensor;simulation;stonekeep	Yenumula B.

830158519559d6a3f3e88ba8a5a952fb02941369	interference of cognitive wireless networks on rayleigh and rice fading channels		We propose amathematical interferencemodel of cognitive wireless networks based on two channels suffering different fading.The primary channel between primary transmitter and primary receiver is under Rayleigh fading. The secondary interference channel between secondary transmitter and primary receiver is under Rice fading. By employing various factors, such as the spectrum sensing scheme and the spatial distribution of the secondary users, the proposedmodel gives an accurate expression of interference probability compared to the statistical models that just approximate the probabilitymodel of the interference or boundsmodels that aim at finding the bounds of the interference. The proposed probability density function (PDF), cumulative distribution function (CDF), and the mean and variance of interference can be extended to a number of applications including power control, spectrum sensing evaluation, secondary users density analysis, and setting interference toleration threshold. Moreover, the framework developed in this paper can be applied to the interference analysis for the nodes of cognitive networks distributed in irregular geographical shapes like finite or infinite zone. The simulation result verifies our theory and is in agreement with the expectation.	approximation algorithm;cognitive network;interference (communication);portable document format;primary channel;rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method;simulation;statistical model;transmitter	Shenghong Li	2014	IJDSN	10.1155/2014/236891	fading distribution;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;telecommunications;zero-forcing precoding	Mobile	37.332994047408015	79.10305184204641	39362

Frequency offsets results in intercarrier interference (ICI) which eventually degrades the performance of the overall system. The most common approach being used to suppress the effects of ICI power in OFDM systems is a pulse-shaping technique. Two novel families of Nyquist-I pulses are proposed to minimize the ICI power and increase signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) power in OFDM-based systems. The proposed pulses are characterized by novel design parameters which provide extra degrees of freedom for a certain value of roll-off factor, α. The proposed pulses are examined with respect to ICI power and SIR in OFDM system. We evaluate and compare the performance of the proposed pulses with other recommended pulses for OFDM systems. Simulation results show that the proposed pulses performed better than other existing pulses in terms of ICI power and SIR for OFDM systems.	catastrophic interference;frequency divider;frequency offset;ici (programming language);interference (communication);multiplexing;next-generation network;noise shaping;pulse shaping;roll-off;simulation;sinc function;time complexity	Shaharyar Kamal;Cesar A.

The received signal is also corrupted by symbol-rate Rayleigh fading and additive white Gaussian noise. A two-step estimation procedure is designed by observing received data in the receiver. In the first step, an asymptotically unbiased estimate of CFO is obtained using a moments based approach. This estimate is then used to derive a maximum-likelihood estimator for the SNR. The Cramer Rao Bound for SNR has been derived to compare the overall estimator performance in terms of its variance.	additive white gaussian noise;carrier frequency offset;coherence (physics);download;nonlinear system;rayleigh fading;signal-to-noise ratio;utility functions on indivisible goods	Syed Ali Hassan;Mary Ann Ingram	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2012.6363676	additive white gaussian noise;telecommunications;maximum likelihood;radio receiver;frequency-shift keying;estimation theory;statistics	Robotics	42.34302498597692	76.05458457135053	39564

Collusion attacks examined in previous work are with con- stant weights for all colluders. Collusion attacks on continuous media (such as audio and video) with time-varying weights are simple to imple- ment, but have never been treated by other researchers. In recent years, we have proposed a new fingerprinting system called MC-CDMA-based fingerprinting since it is inspired by the multi-carrier code division multi- access (MC-CDMA) communication technique. The time-varying collu- sion attack can be conveniently analyzed by drawing an analogy to the multi-access interference (MAI) problem in a wireless communication system with a time-varying channel response. As a result, many pow- erful tools from wireless communications can be borrowed to design a collusion-resistant fingerprinting system. They include codeword design, shifted spreading, pilot-based channel estimation, receiver design, etc. Furthermore, we present results on capacity, throughput, and distortion of a colluded media file. Finally, we will mention some open research problems.	radio fingerprinting	Byung-Ho Cha;C.-C. Jay Kuo	2010	Trans.

bea697e1d73779f34beef45d92eb9b024702b5e7	impact of ieee 802.15.4 communication settings on performance in asynchronous two way uwb ranging		The ultra wideband (UWB) radio signals are known for their good time resolution enabling implementation of accurate localization and tracking. The recent appearance of commercial UWB transceivers in masses on the market has boosted the interest towards this technology and facilitated its use not just for research, but also for business. In this paper we focus on the problem of UWBbased wireless indoor localization of machines and humans by means of IEEE 802.15.4-2015 high rate pulse repetition UWB technology and specifically the accuracy of such localization. Namely, we report the results of an extensive experimental study revealing the effect of various communication settings on the accuracy of indoor localization for the proposed earlier asymmetric localization protocol. The conducted experiments lasted over 200 hours almost nonstop and involved transmission of more than 30 million ranging packets. In the experiments we have tested over 200 different modes and explored the effect of seven different parameters on the UWB ranging performance. The presented results reveal that the communication settings need to be accounted for when determining the time of flight using UWB. Also we show that the accuracy of ranging is strongly affected by the used channel, data rate and pulse repetition frequency. Finally, we note that the increase of the UWB transceiver’s temperature due to selfheating has a strong effect on the results of the localization.	experiment;transceiver;ultra-wideband;uncompressed video	Konstantin Mikhaylov;Juha Petäjäjärvi;Matti Hämäläinen;Antti Tikanmäki;Ryuji Kohno	2017	IJWIN	10.1007/s10776-017-0340-9	telecommunications	Mobile	24.823607892787777	80.25341447076343	39702

Specifically, we first propose a constraint judge method to determine whether a subset has the possibility to obtain a feasible solution and remove the subsets that have no feasible solutions. Then, we propose a searching strategy to further decrease the number of iterations. Moreover, we propose an efficient convex relaxation method to reduce the calculation time of each iteration. Simulation results show that the proposed methods can guarantee the same global optimal solution as generated by the conventional α-based BB (αBB) algorithm, and the BB algorithm combining the three proposed methods achieves much lower convergence time.

For each subcarrier, users rely on adaptive modulation, coding and power modes that they select in accordance with the limited-rate feedback they receive from the access point. The access point uses CSI to maximize the sum of generic concave utilities of the individual average rates in the network while respecting rate and power constraints on the primary and secondary users. Using a stochastic dual approach, optimum dual prices are found to optimally allocate resources across users per channel realization without requiring knowledge of the channel distribution.	adaptive algorithm;channel state information;cognitive radio;concave function;diffusing update algorithm;feedback;frequency band;modulation;resultant;stochastic optimization;subcarrier;wireless access point	Antonio Garcia Marques;Xin Wang;Georgios B.

With a total energy consumption constraint at the source, we provide closed-form expressions for the optimal time sharing and power allocation between the source energy and information transfer signals. The analytical and simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of joint energy and information transfer systems in different conditions.

The timing errors at the receiving nodes are statistically modeled and the effects on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are derived. The distribution of SNR is then used to find the outage probability of the nodes in a hop which together with a Markov model provides the probability of making a successful hop. The results show that the timing synchronization errors reduce the one-hop success probability and the coverage of the network.	algorithm;markov chain;markov model;profiling (computer programming);signal-to-noise ratio;statistical model;sun outage	Muddassar Hussain;Syed Ali Hassan	2014	2014 IFIP Wireless Days (WD)	10.1109/WD.2014.7020838	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing	Metrics	36.12690777852982	78.66752530323369	39795

However, compared to single-input-single-output (SISO) systems, channel estimation in the MIMO scenario becomes more challenging, owing to the increased number of independent transmitter-receiver links to be estimated. In the context of the Bell layered space-time architecture (BLAST) or space division multiple access (SDMA) multi-user MIMO OFDM systems, none of the known channel estimation techniques allows the number of users to be higher than the number of receiver antennas, which is often referred to as a """"rank-deficient"""" scenario, owing to the constraint imposed by the rank of the MIMO channel matrix. Against this background, in this paper we propose a new genetic algorithm (GA) assisted iterative joint channel estimation and multi-user detection (GA-JCEMUD) approach for multi-user MIMO SDMA-OFDM systems, which provides an effective solution to the multi-user MIMO channel estimation problem in the above-mentioned rank-deficient scenario. Furthermore, the GAs invoked in the data detection literature can only provide a hard-decision output for the forward error correction (FEC) or channel decoder, which inevitably limits the system's achievable performance. By contrast, our proposed GA is capable of providing """"soft"""" outputs and hence it becomes capable of achieving an improved performance with the aid of FEC decoders. A range of simulation results are provided to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme."""	blast;channel state information;error detection and correction;forward error correction;frequency divider;genetic algorithm;iterative method;mimo-ofdm;multi-user mimo;multiplexing;simulation;soft-in soft-out decoder;standard database management analysis;telecommunications link;transmitter	Ming Jiang;Jos Akhtman;Lajos Hanzo Hanzo	2007	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2007.05817	3g mimo;multi-user mimo;genetic algorithm;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;mimo-ofdm;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics;iterative method;precoding;statistics;mimo	Mobile	46.12367510758943	76.01681623607385	39821

In the proposed method, the second codeword is fed back in addition to the best codeword as their interpolation at the transmitter improves the channel knowledge. The derivation of the optimal interpolation parameter is presented together with the derivation of an upper-bound to the interpolation parameter based on channel quality feedback available at the transmitter. We show that double codeword feedback refinement has slightly lower complexity than alternative techniques and still achieves similar performance. Furthermore, double codeword coding can be generalized to higher transmission ranks. Using extended multiuser MIMO link simulations, we verify that the double codeword feedback is able to provide significant gains in 3GPP LTE context.	channel state information;code word;codebook;compaq lte;computable function;feedback;interpolation;level of detail;mimo-ofdm;multi-user mimo;multiplexing;os-tan;quantization (signal processing);refinement (computing);rewrite (programming);sandy bridge;scheduling (computing);simulation;transmitter	Karol Schober;Risto Wichman;Mihai Enescu	2016	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2516013	design;mathematical optimization;3g mimo;electronic engineering;quantization;interpolation;computer science;codebook;control theory;mathematics;channel state information;statistics;mimo	Visualization	43.762368249511496	78.18519968448982	39856

In GPQSM, spatial modulation works in both the in-phase and quadrature parts of the received signals, thus conveying additional information bits compared with conventional generalized precoding-aided spatial modulation (GPSM). The proposed scheme is general and can degenerate into the conventional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) scheme. A closed-form upper bound on the average bit error probability of GPQSM is derived. Simulation results verify the theoretical analysis and show that GPQSM outperforms the conventional GPSM scheme and the MIMO scheme under the same spectral efficiency.	bit error rate;mimo;modulation;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectral efficiency	Jun Li;Miaowen Wen;Xiang Cheng;Yier Yan;Sang Seob Song;Moon Ho Lee	2017	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2016.2565618	delta modulation;detector;electronic engineering;pulse-amplitude modulation;quadrature amplitude modulation;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics;pulse-position modulation;radio receiver;statistics;mimo;quadrature modulation;modulation	Mobile	43.19793251257685	77.33946784341225	40017

A complete MMSE-SIC detector needs to compute at both the preprocessing and SIC-detection stages. Since the SIC detection, which can be regarded as a backward substitution, is inevitable, we develop a computationally efficient preprocessing algorithm that relies on the backward substitution. We then propose a low-cost hardware architecture with a commonly shared backward-substitution module to work at both the preprocessing and detection stages. The very-large-scale-integration implementation results of our architecture for the four-by-four MIMO system using the 0.18-μm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology reveal that our architecture requires the fewest 79-K gates, provides the high throughput rate of 416 Mb/s, and works with the smallest preprocessing latency of 64 clock cycles. Our MMSE-SIC detector is a cheap solution for MIMO detection.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;bell laboratories layered space-time;cmos;clock signal;interference (communication);mimo;mean squared error;mebibyte;multiplexing;preprocessor;semiconductor;simplified instructional computer;throughput;very-large-scale integration	Tsung-Hsien Liu;Jin-Yi Jiang;Yuan-Sun Chu	2011	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2010.2092819	minimum mean square error;electronic engineering;real-time computing;computer science;control theory;mathematics;statistics	Arch	46.66114443052283	64.27790498815838	40018

Then as a preliminary result to solve the unified fusion rule problem for multisensor multi-hypothesis network decision systems with fading channels, we propose the unified fusion rule for a specific l sensors parallel binary Bayesian decision system under assumption that the ith sensor is required to transmit a certain number ri of bits via fading channel while the fusion center can receive its own observation. Since the communication pattern at every node including the fusion center in the multisensor multi-hypothesis decision network are the same as the above parallel binary Bayesian decision system, the above unified fusion rule results can be extended appropriately to more general multisensor multi-hypothesis network decision systems with fading channels, such as the tandem and tree network. More precisely speaking, for these network decision systems, a unified fusion rule is proposed. People only need to optimize sensor rules under the proposed unified fusion rule to achieve global optimal decision performance. More significantly, the unified fusion rule does not depend distributions of sensor observations, decision criterion, and the characteristics of fading channels.Finally, several numerical examples support the above analytic results and show a interesting phenomenon that the two points (0, 0) and (1, 1) may not be the beginning and end points of ROCs when all channels are fading channels, while in ideal channel case they are the start and end.	decision support system;influence diagram;norm (social);numerical analysis;numerical method;sensor;tree network	Qing'an Ren;Yunmin Zhu;Yifan Xia	2008	2008 IEEE Conference on Robotics, Automation and Mechatronics	10.1109/RAMECH.2008.4681429	electronic engineering;computer science;engineering;machine learning;data mining;fading;statistics;global optimization	Robotics	28.206428087023763	70.77598066895423	40069

Muramatsu et al. proposed a code using LDPC matrices for Slepian-Wolf source coding. However, since they employed ML decoding, their code is not universal, that is their decoder needs to know the probability distribution of the source. On the other hand, if there exists a universal code using LDPC matrices, we can arbitrary decrease the error probability for all sources whose achievable rate region contains the rate pair of encoders even if the probability distribution of sources is unknown. To this end, we show the existence of a universal Slepian-Wolf source code using LDPC matrices in the case where the source is stationary memoryless.	block code;channel capacity;data compression;decoding methods;encoder;forward error correction;low-density parity-check code;stationary process;universal code (data compression)	Tetsunao Matsuta;Tomohiko Uyematsu;Ryutaroh Matsumoto	2010	2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513253	probability distribution;concatenated error correction code;distributed source coding;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;low-density parity-check code;universal code;variable-length code;theoretical computer science;mathematics;forward error correction;error exponent;statistics;source code	Theory	37.856489332422655	63.47392596206358	40090

The motivation is to apply molecular-based communications to challenging electromagnetic environments. We first derive a novel capture probability expression of a finite sized receiver. The paper then introduces the concept of time-aggregated molecular noise at the receiver as a function of the rate at which the sensor can self-cleanse. The resulting inter-symbol-interference is expressed as a function of the sensor cleanse time, and the performance metrics of bit error rate, throughput and round-trip-time are derived. The results show that the performance is very sensitive to the sensor cleanse time and the drift velocity. The paper concludes with recommendations on the design of a real communication link based on these findings and applies the concepts to a test-bed.	bit error rate;interference (communication);sensor;testbed;the australian;throughput;velocity (software development);x.690	Siyi Wang;Weisi Guo;Song Qiu;Mark D.

The proposed methodology relies on adding a recursive least square (RLS) based adaptive linear equalizer (ALE) to the physical layer of the receiver side. The performance of the RLS based ALE is investigated inside the ZigBee system under different multipath fading situations: Rician and Rayleigh. Moreover, the paper proposes a methodology for deciding the RLS based ALE’s design parameters. The design procedure depends on solving multiple objectives optimizing function based on genetic algorithms (GAs). The ALE’s parameters are chosen, such that the system experiences minimum bit error rate (BER) with fast convergence response. For design verification purposes, the ZigBee transceiver is modeled in MATLAB Simulink and tested under different fading and signal to noise ratios. In addition, the performance of the RLS adaptation algorithm is compared with the least mean square (LMS) one. The results show that the RLS based ALE provides better ZigBee performance with less BER and fast adaptation response.		Asmaa M. Romia;Hanaa S.

For the shift invariant TOA estimation, the received chirp must be transformed into sinusoidal form. There are two types of preprocessing transformations: de-chirping and the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) with de-convolution. By applying the proposed transformation based on multiple references, performance improvement for the TOA estimation can be achieved in multipath channels. The effectiveness of the proposed preprocessing transformation is analyzed and verified through Monte Carlo simulations in multipath channels.	chirp;convolution;discrete fourier transform;monte carlo method;multipath propagation;preprocessor;rake;simulation;time of arrival	Daegun Oh;Daekyung Kim;Jong-Wha Chong	2012	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2012.011312.112181	speech recognition;telecommunications;mathematics;statistics;monte carlo method	Visualization	51.61063947552714	76.90238227559435	40138

We demonstrate that increasing the density of the ground station network gives diminishing returns on the performance of the UAV backhaul, and that for an LTE backhaul the ground stations can benefit from being co-located with an existing base station network.	compaq lte;data rate units;roland gs;unmanned aerial vehicle;wireless access point	Boris Galkin;Jacek Kibilda;Luiz A.

For these modulation formats, the optimal decision regions used at the detector are identified and analytical expressions for the error probabilities are obtained. Numerical techniques are employed to compute the error probabilities. It is concluded that increasing the peakedness of the signals results in reduced error rates for a given power level and hence improve the energy efficiency.	coherence (physics);key (cryptography);modulation;numerical analysis;on-off keying	Mustafa Cenk Gursoy	2006	2006 Fortieth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers		on-off keying;telecommunications;information theory;word error rate;computer science;phase-shift keying;probability of error;decision rule;mathematics;efficient energy use;signal-to-noise ratio;fading;wireless;statistics	HPC	40.12970944297497	75.2996579735172	40373

We consider a practical scenario where GSC scheme is applied to the receiver considering both the complexity and the energy dissipation while maximal ratio combining (MRC) scheme is applied to the eavesdropper in order to maximize its instantaneous signal to noise ratio (SNR). This work bridges the gap between the existing works utilizing MRC scheme and transmit antenna selection (TAS) scheme to enhance the PHY security. Closed-form expressions for both the probability of non-zero secrecy capacity and the exact secrecy outage probability are derived over Rayleigh fading channels. The security capacity performances are also shown and analyzed through numerical results. The impacts of the number of selected branches, the average SNR of transmitter's channel and eavesdropper's channel are discussed.	downtime;gsc bus;generalized selection;maximal set;numerical analysis;phy (chip);performance;rayleigh fading;signal-to-noise ratio;thermal-assisted switching;transmitter	Li Chen;Ying Yang;Guo Wei	2013	2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666191	spatial correlation;telecommunications;probability;channel capacity;statistics;computer network	Mobile	35.537221533071076	81.19687968143501	40494

In this paper, we employ the widely used Gilbert model to modelise error bursts and evaluate the effects of interleaving. We derive an expression for the transition matrix in the presence of an interleaver. Starting from an identified error model, it is possible to simulate easily the effects of any interleaving depth. This allows in a simply way the choice of an interleaving degree and an forward error correction (FEC) code.	error detection and correction;forward error correction;gilbert cell;hidden markov model;markov chain;simulation;stochastic matrix	Thierry Rancurel;Daniel Roviras;Jean Conan;Francis Castanie	2000	2000 10th European Signal Processing Conference	10.5281/zenodo.37225	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science	EDA	42.068595808050944	65.94184487728974	40585

The symbol error probability (SEP) for -PSK modulated signals is evaluated and analytical approximations for the SEP of the individual signals are presented and compared with results obtained from simulations. For geometrically related signal amplitudes, a constant minimum distance can be guaranteed independent of the number of signals. The required amplitude ratio is shown to be related to and the number of co-channel signals. Optimizing the transmitted power for the different signals while ensuring the same SEP is then addressed and closed-form expressions of the signal amplitude ratios are derived. The effect of inaccurately estimated signal parameters due to noise is also analyzed.

On the other hand, the candidate generation and assessment is done successively. If a given tolerable metric limit is met the procedure stops. Analytical expressions for the average number of tested candidates and the achieved performance are derived. Critical metric values, as generalization of the “critical” PAR value ξ = log(D), where D is the number of carriers, are defined.

The effects of antenna directivity on path loss and multipath propagation in the channel are analyzed extensively for various omnidirectional and directional antenna combinations. A statistical model of the path loss in the channel is presented, in which all path loss exponents result in better than free space loss. The shadow fading experienced in the channel is shown to highly agree with the normal probability assumption. There is a significant reduction in root mean square delay spread when directional antennas are used at the transmitter and receiver or solely at the receiver with respect to an omnidirectional/omnidirectional antenna pair. Finally, a distance-dependent statistical impulse response model of the channel is presented along with simulation results that significantly concur with the measured data.	channel (communications);cluster analysis;cox–ingersoll–ross model;fractal antenna;frequency band;line-of-sight (missile);mean squared error;multipath propagation;simulation;software propagation;statistical model;transmitter;ultra-wideband	Jason A.

The proposed estimator uses only one received OFDM symbol to perform estimation and does not require the knowledge of power delay profile, except that the number of delay paths should be known. The search range for the CFO is first partitioned into a number of subranges. The expectation-maximization (EM) and Newton's methods are then used within each subrange in an alternative manner to jointly obtain the channel and the CFO estimates. By assuming that the transmitted time-domain OFDM signals can be modeled as Gaussian random variables, we show that the EM method has closed-form expressions and, thus, can be efficiently implemented. We then study the mean-square-error (MSE) performance of the estimator under various signal-to-noise (SNRs) ratios and various numbers of cyclic prefix samples through simulations. Finally, we compare the performance of our proposed estimator with that of some existing estimators in terms of bit error rate (BER). Our simulation results show that the proposed estimator performs better than the reported estimator, which sequentially estimates the channel and the CFO. By suitably choosing the number of subranges, our estimator also performs better than a reported estimator, which makes use of pilot symbols to obtain the initial CFO and channel estimates and then uses a decision-directed technique for overall eventual estimation.	bit error rate;carrier frequency offset;expectation–maximization algorithm;mean squared error;multiplexing;newton;newton's method;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;x.690	Ronghong Mo;Yong Huat Chew;Tjeng Thiang Tjhung;Chi Chung Ko	2008	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2008.917240	efficient estimator;random variable;stochastic process;minimax estimator;minimum-variance unbiased estimator;electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;stein's unbiased risk estimate;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;maximum likelihood;consistent estimator;statistics	Metrics	50.3377918083497	74.11927371346779	40668

The complexity associated with a richly scattering environment implies that the short-term fading process is inherently hard to predict and best modeled stochastically, with rapid decorrelation properties in space, time, and frequency. In this paper, we demonstrate how the channel state between a wireless transmitter and receiver can be used as the basis for building practical secret key generation protocols between two entities. We begin by presenting a scheme based on level crossings of the fading process, which is well-suited for the Rayleigh and Rician fading models associated with a richly scattering environment. Our level crossing algorithm is simple, and incorporates a self-authenticating mechanism to prevent adversarial manipulation of message exchanges during the protocol. Since the level crossing algorithm is best suited for fading processes that exhibit symmetry in their underlying distribution, we present a second and more powerful approach that is suited for more general channel state distributions. This second approach is motivated by observations from quantizing jointly Gaussian processes, but exploits empirical measurements to set quantization boundaries and a heuristic log likelihood ratio estimate to achieve an improved secret key generation rate. We validate both proposed protocols through experimentations using a customized 802.11a platform, and show for the typical WiFi channel that reliable secret key establishment can be accomplished at rates on the order of 10 b/s.	algorithm;authentication;decorrelation;entity;gaussian process;heuristic;key (cryptography);key exchange;key generation;multipath propagation;rayleigh–ritz method;transmitter	Chunxuan Ye;Suhas Mathur;Alex Reznik;Yogendra Shah;Wade Trappe;Narayan B.

L1/L2 control signals are necessary for key packet access techniques such as downlink scheduling, link adaptation, hybrid automatic repeat request (ARQ) with soft combining, and for uplink feedback control signals. We first propose a SC-based multiplexing scheme for L1/L2 control signals within a shared data channel for a set of user equipment (UE) that transmits both an uplink shared data channel and L1/L2 control signals within the same subframe. We also propose a multiplexing scheme for L1/L2 control signals without uplink data transmission that takes advantage of intra-subframe frequency hopping (FH) using multiple exclusively-assigned time-frequency resource blocks (RBs) to obtain a frequency diversity gain. Furthermore, we propose an orthogonal CDMA-based multiplexing scheme using cyclic shifts of a constant amplitude zero auto-correlation (CAZAC) sequence for L1/L2 control signals from different UEs within the same narrowband time-frequency RB. Computer simulation results show that the proposed SC-based multiplexing scheme for the L1/L2 control signals within the shared data channel achieves a higher user throughput than a multicarrier-based multiplexing scheme. The results also show that the proposed multiplexing scheme for the L1/L2 control signals that takes advantage of the intra-subframe FH for the UE without uplink data transmission achieves high quality reception through large frequency diversity gain. Furthermore, we show that the proposed cyclic-shift based orthogonal CDMA multiplexing is effective in the multiplexing of multiple L1/L2 control signals from different UEs within the same RB.	multiplexing;telecommunications link	Teruo Kawamura;Yoshihisa Kishiyama;Kenichi Higuchi;Mamoru Sawahashi	2009	IEICE Transactions		computer simulation;statistical time division multiplexing;channel access method;telecommunications link;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;time-division multiplexing;multiplexing	Networks	44.23693863869867	83.46021563286195	40714

It differentiates from conventional timing recovery algorithms for OFDM systems in two aspects. Firstly a new timing-clock-offset (TO) estimator is proposed, which utilizes the post MIMO detection SNRs to weight and combine TO estimates in frequency and spatial domains. This TO estimator efficiently handles the MIMO fading and the colored noise caused by MIMO detection to improve the estimation accuracy. Secondly, a novel third-order PLL structure is developed and its stochastic difference equation (SDE) that represents the dynamic behavior of the tracking loop is derived and used to evaluate the loop performance. The proposed PLL has an good loop noise performance for fast acquisition and stable tracking. The analysis and simulation show that the proposed timing recovery scheme outperforms the conventional timing recovery schemes in MIMO fading channel.	algorithm;arnold tongue;autoregressive model;carrier recovery;colors of noise;mimo;mimo-ofdm;phase-locked loop;recurrence relation;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Wenzhen Li;Masayuki Tomisawa	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2007.845	phase-locked loop;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;fading;statistics	Robotics	50.18029705823375	77.9019808348518	40761

Moreover, the tradeoff between pulse width (i.e. spectral efficiency) and BER of both even and odd pulses is presented.	acoustic lobing;autocorrelation;bit error rate;multi-user;prolate spheroidal wave function;pulse duration;pulse-width modulation;requirement;sampling (signal processing);spectral efficiency;transistor;ultra-wideband;x.690	Hen-Geul Yeh;Tilson Yao-Yang Chung	2015	2015 Annual IEEE Systems Conference (SysCon) Proceedings	10.1109/SYSCON.2015.7116832	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	42.971187693711975	77.77034276969714	40763

The system performance in presence of a synchronization mismatch between two interfering base stations (BS) is analyzed in the way that a mobile terminal receives the perfectly synchronized signal from the desired BS as well as the signal from one interfering BS with a synchronization offset. It is demonstrated through simulations that spreading and cell specific random subcarrier interleaving effectively decorrelates the interfering signal, independent of the synchronization offset. Furthermore, the robustness of the channel estimator to cellular interference is examined.

There is no exact channel capacity expression for optical wireless communication systems in IM/DD additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, but capacity bounds exist. In this letter, channel capacity for optical wireless communications in the IM/DD AWGN channel is analyzed based on Fano's inequality, and peak-and-average optical power constraints are considered. New lower bounds, which are tight in the specific signal to noise ratio (SNR) region, are derived under two cases of peak-and-average optical power constraints. Besides, the lower bounds can be achieved in practical environment by using DC-biased M-ary pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) scheme.	additive white gaussian noise;channel capacity;fano's inequality;optical wireless;pulse-width modulation;signal-to-noise ratio;social inequality;utility functions on indivisible goods	Liang Wu;Zaichen Zhang;Jian Dang;Huaping Liu	2015	2015 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2015.7341323	electronic engineering;telecommunications;intensity modulation;phase-shift keying;mathematics;optics;optical modulation amplitude	Embedded	39.74183022036186	75.08987983589378	40884
f4ad81b6b71fcc6c69223583df5c4c3908d511fd	performance analysis of two cooperative multicast schemes in cellular networks		This paper discusses multicast schemes in cellular networks based on rateless codes and cooperative relaying technologies. Unlike fixed-rate codes, rateless codes do not require channel state information at transmitters or feedback of successful reception of individual packets from recipient user equipment (UEs). Cooperative relaying among a group of multicast recipient UEs can further improve wireless multicast service. In the proposed cooperative multicast (CM) scheme, after part of the recipients have decoded the source message of the base station (BS), these recipients can act as cooperative relays (CRs) and simultaneously transmit the decoded information to other recipients. The CM process stops after all the recipients have reliably decoded the message. If the CRs use different fountain codes, the other recipients can accumulate the mutual information from the BS and the CRs. If the CRs use the same fountain code as used by the BS, the recipients can only accumulate the received energy. By comparing with the conventional direct transmission based multicast scheme, the transmission delay, the energy consumption, and the spectrum efficiency performances of the proposed CM schemes are evaluated. The simulation results show that the mutual information accumulation (MIA) based CM scheme outperforms the energy accumulation (EA) based CM scheme in the spectrum and energy efficiency. This is because the MIA approach acquires better time delay performance but consumes less energy than the EA approach.	multicast;profiling (computer programming)	Guopeng Zhang;Zuyan Wang;Jie Gu;Kun Yang;Peng Liu	2017	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-016-3831-6	multicast;xcast;real-time computing;channel state information;computer network;fountain code;transmission delay;source-specific multicast;computer science;network packet;spectral efficiency	Mobile	33.80798228538988	77.52290880698489	40930

However, in practice, the modulation order is limited, since conventional digital carrier recovery (CR) algorithms give rise to unacceptable phase error. The authors present an efficient software-aided technique for phase error reduction in CR for high-order QAM, based on the simple and well-known fourth power CR loop. Analytical and simulation results indicate that the new technique has several attractive features such as approximate of invariance of phase error improvement over modulation order and low hardware complexity for modulation orders as high as 256-QAM. Experimental results for 64 and 256-QAM illustrate phase error variance of less than -110 dBc/Hz at the frequency offset of 10 kHz, that is, 30 dB reduction of phase error variance or 3 dB increase in system processing gain compared to the conventional fourth power CR loop. This allows a significant improvement of bandwidth efficiency by increasing the modulation order, at the cost of slight complexity overhead.	carrier recovery;modulation	Babak Bornoosh;Abdolreza Nabavi	2010	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2009.0762	qam;carrierless amplitude phase modulation;continuous phase modulation;pulse-amplitude modulation;quadrature amplitude modulation;error detection and correction;telecommunications;computer science;modulation error ratio;invariant;frequency offset;control theory;analog transmission;overmodulation;spectral efficiency;quadrature modulation	Mobile	51.80091213681189	72.6166212794331	40934

This is applied to a multi-track two dimensional magnetic recording (TDMR) system. The multi-level 2D BCJR detector handled the code constraint while performing joint detection and single parity decoding. Two coding approaches are presented in this paper: 1) parity bits are applied along-track direction only, separated with a dithered relative prime (DRP) interleaver, and 2) parity bits are applied in both along-track and across-tracks directions. The results show that the new constrained coded multi-track 2D BCJR joint detector provides improved performance with low detection complexity.	bcjr algorithm;cyk algorithm;detection theory;disaster recovery plan;dither;forward error correction;hard disk drive;interference (communication);magnetic storage;parity bit	Mohammed D.

For both delay-tolerant and delay-sensitive services, the durations of the three phases are optimized, aimed at maximizing the energy efficiency (EE) of the system. To this end, we derive the approximate average net spectrum efficiency (SE) and outage probability with imperfect uplink channel estimation, which are used to characterize the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements for the two kinds of services, respectively. The impact of QoS requirement, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and circuit power consumption on the optimal transmission durations is analyzed. For delay-tolerant services, analytical results show that the EE-oriented design leads to a longer training duration than the SE-oriented design in general. For delay-sensitive services, it is shown that introducing BS idling is crucial in improving the EE. The challenges and opportunities of applying the proposed transmission strategies in current and future cellular systems are discussed, and the transmission strategies are extended from single-user single-service to multiuser mixed-service scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate the significant EE gain of the EE-oriented design over the SE-oriented design in both single-user and multiuser scenarios.	approximation algorithm;channel state information;multi-user;quality of service;requirement;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectral efficiency;sun outage;system analysis;telecommunications link;transmission (bittorrent client)	Xin Liu;Shengqian Han;Chenyang Yang	2015	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2014.2352646	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;engineering	Mobile	33.565912050031194	86.38954534160527	41031

In this paper, we propose a different optimization model for underwater acoustic (UWA) channels, which is achieved by two algorithms: one is the bandwidth-efficient bit loading algorithm; the other is the Lloyd algorithm based limited feedback procedure. It aims at minimizing the power consumption with constraints of the constant symbol data rate and desired bit-error-rate (BER). The optimization result is derived by the Lagrange multiplier method. The Lloyd algorithm is employed to quantize the CSI at the receiver and construct the codebook, which is adopted to achieve the limited feedback process. After selecting an initial bit loading vector upon the current CSI, the receiver will broadcast its index to the transmitter, then the transmitter will compute the bandwidth-efficient bit loading algorithm and allocate the corresponding power and bits to each subcarrier. Simulation results will reveal the benefits of adopting these two algorithms from different aspects.	acoustic cryptanalysis;bit error rate;codebook;constrained optimization;data rate units;expectation–maximization algorithm;feedback;iterative method;lagrange multiplier;mimo-ofdm;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;simulation;subcarrier;transmitter;uncompressed video;x.690	Xiaopeng Huang;Victor B.

Considering BS sleep mode operation under different scenarios, we focus on three wake-up policies: single vacation (SV) policy, multiple vacation (MV) policy and N policy. A hysteresis time is also considered to avoid frequent BS mode-changing operation. By modeling the systems as M/G/1 vacation queues, we derive two performance measures of interest, expected system response time and energy consumption per bit. The impacts of sleep mode operation parameters and setup time are also studied. In order to determine the optimal parameter settings, which allows for a flexible tradeoff between energy-efficiency and mean delay, a two-step optimization method is proposed. We numerically analyze and investigate the energy-delay tradeoff for different policies, and find that both the MV policy and the N policy have better performance than the SV policy if the sniffing cost is not considered. However, these advantages diminish when the sniffing cost increases.	constrained optimization;flip-flop (electronics);hysteresis;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimization problem;packet analyzer;response time (technology);sleep mode;systemverilog	Xueying Guo;Sheng Zhou;Zhisheng Niu;Panganamala Ramana Kumar	2013	Proceedings of the 2013 25th International Teletraffic Congress (ITC)	10.1109/ITC.2013.6662947	real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;queueing theory;statistics;computer network	Metrics	31.801027870574327	86.37829344538333	41197
7f0165a4346c4fc4f314353c1210289b0baa7b51	multiple preambles for high success rate of grant-free random access with massive mimo		Grant-free random access (RA) with massive MIMO is a promising RA technique with low signaling overhead that provides significant benefits in increasing the channel reuse efficiency. Since user equipment (UE) detection and channel estimation in grant-free RA rely solely on the received preambles, preamble designs that enable high success rate of UE detection and channel estimation are very much in need to ensure the performance gain of grant-free RA with massive MIMO. In this paper, a super preamble consisting of multiple consecutive preambles is proposed for high success rate of grant-free RA with massive MIMO. With the proposed approach, the success of UE detection and channel estimation for a RA UE depends on two conditions: 1) it is a solvable UE; 2) its super preamble is detected. Accordingly, we theoretically analyze the solvable rate of RA UEs with multiple preambles and propose a reliable UE detection algorithm to obtain the super preambles of RA UEs by exploiting the quasi-orthogonality characteristic of massive MIMO. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that turning a preamble into a super preamble consisting of two or three shorter preambles, the success rate of UE detection and channel estimation could be significantly increased using the proposed approach.	algorithm;channel state information;decision problem;mimo;overhead (computing);random access;simulation;traffic collision avoidance system	Hao Jiang;Daiming Qu;Jie Ding;Tao Jiang	2018	CoRR		real-time computing;mathematical optimization;user equipment;mimo;mathematics;random access;communication channel	Mobile	40.673080220092494	86.29692755612254	41206
af060798bf40f591b903fdb820808f58e64d8147	noma in distributed antenna system for max-min fairness and max-sum-rate		Distributed antenna system (DAS) has been deployed for over a decade. DAS has advantages in capacity especially for the cell edge users, in both single-cell and multi-cell environments. In this paper, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is suggested in single-cell DAS to maximize user fairness and sumrate. Two transmission strategies are considered: NOMA with single selection transmission and NOMA with blanket transmission. In a two-user scenario, the center base station (BS) uses NOMA to serve both users and the remote radio units (RRUs) serve only the weak user based on the transmission scheme. The signals sent from the RRUs are not considered as interference at both user sides. At one side, the signals from the RRUs are used to detect the required data and at the other side, the signals are used to perform successive interference cancellation (SIC). The max-min performance is studied when instantaneous channel gain information (CGI) or channel distribution information (CDI) is known at the transmitter. A closed-form expression of the upper bound is derived for the data rate of each user with only CDI. In addition, the sum-rate is studied with a minimum rate constraint when instantaneous CGI known at the transmitter. The results show that NOMA with blanket transmission gives the best performance compared to other schemes; conventional-NOMA, conventional single selection scheme and joint-transmission (JT) NOMA. It is also shown that with less transmit power, NOMA with single selection transmission gives better performance than conventional-NOMA.	bell laboratories layered space-time;cell (microprocessor);common gateway interface;fairness measure;interference (communication);jt (visualization format);mathematical optimization;max-min fairness;maxima and minima;minimax;multistage interconnection networks;performance;scenario (computing);simplified instructional computer;transmitter;uncompressed video	Dong-Jun Han;Minseok Choi;Jaekyun Moon	2017	CoRR		single antenna interference cancellation;distributed antenna system;transmitter power output;mathematics;transmitter;computer network;max-min fairness;upper and lower bounds;base station;communication channel	Mobile	37.885650863648046	85.00396563217737	41249

Nevertheless, the performance advantages of cooperative relaying diminish considerably if co-channel interference is present. Optimum combining (OC) can be used to mitigate the adverse effects of co-channel interference in wireless communications. The performance of optimum combining in a decode-and-forward relay network with N equal-power interferers is analyzed. The probability density function of the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio is obtained and a closed-form expression for the exact outage probability is derived for N ≥M+1 where M is the number of relay nodes. An approximation for the symbol error rate (SER) is presented. The performance results and closed-form expressions for outage probability and for SER suggest that the asymptotic diversity gain of OC is equal to M, which is a significant improvement over maximal-ratio combining, whose asymptotic diversity gain is equal to zero when operating in co-channel interference.	approximation;direction finding;downtime;interference (communication);maximal set;multi-user mimo;portable document format;profiling (computer programming);relay;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;sun outage	Navod Suraweera;Norman C.

The transmission delays in asynchronous channels need to be estimated in practice and are subject to estimation errors, which may cause severe performance degradation for most detectors assuming perfect synchronization. As the fundamental framework of the robust detector, an asynchronous subspace detection scheme based on oblique projection is introduced and examined in comparison with the conventional RAKE receiver and the multipath decorrelator. The performance degradation of the subspace detector due to delay estimation errors is also investigated. The robust detector shows reliable performance even when the errors are much larger than those of delay estimation algorithms like MUSIC, and it is not affected by the near-far problem.	algorithm;elegant degradation;multipath propagation;oblique projection;rayleigh fading;sensor	Yong-Suk Moon;Mostafa Kaveh;Laurie B.

However, frequency domain channel estimation suffers from the inter-carrier interference(ICI) caused by carrier frequency offset (CFO). In this paper, we proposed new training sequence structure for channel estimation to reduce the estimation errors caused by residual CFO. The proposed new training sequence structure can be easily obtained from any existing channel training sequences without introducing significant changes to their original property. Simulation results show that, this scheme can efficiently reduce the channel estimation errors in FDE system, and improve the system performance.	adobe framemaker;carrier frequency offset;channel state information;ici (programming language);multipath propagation;simulation;subcarrier	Ying Chen;Jian Zhang;Dhammika Jayalath	2008	2008 IEEE 68th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECF.2008.402	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;computer performance;frequency domain	Mobile	48.61244561333609	79.38661769833507	41371

Mobility issues have become challenging for the rollout for WiMAX networks in order to compete against the other competitive technologies such as 3.5G and LTE. In this paper, a unified approach to derive the overall BER and data rate for mobile WiMAX (in uplink direction) will be introduced. This approach will take into consideration different operational scenarios such as time varying channels with different values of channel estimation precision values, different number of subcarriers, and different symbol durations. An analytical expression for the effect of ICI power on the bit error probability and effective bit rate will be obtained for BPSK, QPSK, and 16QAM in presence of AMC. This paper also investigates the effect of the use of AMC techniques on the obtained system performance.	advanced mezzanine card;bit error rate;channel state information;compaq lte;ici (programming language);modulation;profiling (computer programming);rayleigh fading;subcarrier;telecommunications link;uncompressed video;x.690	Reem Abdelhadi;Hesham Elbadawy;Salwa H.

We analyze the analog weights from the perspectives of maximizing analog signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and effective channel capacity $${(\tilde{C})}$$ . We propose simple sub-optimal algorithms to calculate receive analog weights in both open loop (OL) and closed loop (CL) systems, and compare the proposed schemes with an all-digital combining system, in terms of $${\tilde{C}}$$ . For both criteria, a small number of additional antennas is required to achieve the same mean capacity as an all-digital combining system in an urban micro model, e.g., 1 additional antenna in selection diversity and combining is required to achieve the same capacity as in a 2 × 4 all-digital CL system at low SNR. The additional number of antennas is smaller in CL than in OL. The effective channel capacity based on the SNR maximization criterion is similar to that based on the $${\tilde{C}}$$ maximization criterion, but the computational complexity the analog weights calculation is lower for the SNR maximization criterion.	mimo	Xin Zhou;Jack H.

By trying 2η test vectors, the soft-decision Chase decoding algorithm of BCH codes can achieve significant coding gain over hard-decision decoding. Previous one-pass Chase schemes find the error locators based on the Berlekamp's algorithm and need hardware-demanding selection methods to decide which locator corresponds to the correct code word. In this brief, a novel interpolation-based one-pass Chase decoder is proposed for BCH codes. By making use of the binary property of BCH codes, an innovative yet low-complexity method is developed to select the interpolation output leading to successful decoding without bringing any performance loss. The code word recovery step is also significantly simplified through nontrivial mathematical derivations. From architectural analysis, the proposed decoder with η = 4 for a (4200, 4096) BCH code has 2.3 times higher efficiency in terms of throughput-over-area ratio than the prior one-pass Chase decoder based on the Berlekamp's algorithm, while achieving the same error-correcting performance.	bch code;berlekamp's algorithm;code word;coding gain;digital video broadcasting;error detection and correction;flash memory;interpolation;online locator service;overhead (computing);polynomial;reduction (complexity);throughput	Xinmiao Zhang	2013	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2013.2251941	discrete mathematics;interpolation;computer science;theoretical computer science;maxeksat;mathematics;bch code;berlekamp–welch algorithm;reed–solomon error correction;algorithm;forney algorithm;statistics	EDA	43.50344974721726	62.01802620001877	41463

The amplitude of the transmitted signal from multicode transmission systems such as PC/SS systems have a large dynamic range which requires that amplifiers have a wide linearity in the transmitter. From a view point of power efficiency, however, it is reasonable to use non-linear amplifiers rather than linear ones. In that case, the bit error rate performance must degrade because of non-linear distortion. The proposed system can avoid influence of the non-linear amplifiers by making the transmitted signal have a constant amplitude. The bit error rate performance and the data transmission rate performance are investigated. They prove that the proposed system is an attractive candidate among the constant amplitude signaling systems.

However, the Gaussian assumption for soft messages in conventional EXIT (extrinsic information transfer)-chart-based optimization algorithms result in prediction gaps in the decoding threshold for certain transmission systems. In this letter, we propose an EXIT-chart-based optimization method, in which all the Gaussian assumptions for soft messages can be avoided. Compared to the conventional design methods, the proposed method provides a more accurate threshold prediction and can be used to design LDPC-coded schemes with better error performances.	algorithm;exit chart;low-density parity-check code;mathematical optimization;performance;resultant;simulation;x.690	Yen-Ming Chen;Yeong-Luh Ueng;Hau-Jung Shiau	2013	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2013.052413.130979	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;linear predictive coding;computer science;theoretical computer science;gaussian process;mathematics;error floor;statistics	EDA	41.33287961279723	65.42074055754848	41611

In this article, we present some decision-directed b lind algorithms and use a time-varying vector channel simulator to compare their performance with those of many recently proposed algorithms. It is shown that decision-directed chip-level al gorithms can operate without the use of training sequences to avoid ca tastrophic error propagation, and that one should not expect an increase in performance from using least squares instead of le astmean-square. Furthermore the unpracticability of the bitlevel algorithm [1] and of the least significant algorithm [4] under t ime varying environment is outlined.

The destination detects the signals transmitted from the relays with successive interference cancellation (SIC) whose performance suffers from the error propagation. The traditional detection methods assuming that the prior-detected symbols are correct, none of them considers the still existing error propagation. In this paper, we propose a novel soft-information-aided detection algorithm which takes advantage of the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) information of the prior-detected signals. In the proposed algorithm, the interference cancellation and detection ordering both take the error propagation effect into consideration, thus making the detection more reliable. The new algorithm will be performed in the ZF-SIC CSM systems, and the simulation results will show that the new proposed algorithm can achieve better BER performance compared with traditional ones.	algorithm;anisotropic filtering;bell laboratories layered space-time;community climate system model;interference (communication);lucas–lehmer–riesel test;propagation of uncertainty;relay;simplified instructional computer;simulation;software propagation;spatial multiplexing;unified extensible firmware interface;x.690;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Kai Wu;Lin Sang;Cong Xiong;Junyu Wang;Rui Gao;Dacheng Yang;Xin Zhang	2009	2009 IEEE 70th Vehicular Technology Conference Fall	10.1109/VETECF.2009.5378701	single antenna interference cancellation;electronic engineering;bit error rate;telecommunications;likelihood-ratio test;computer science;electrical engineering;phase-shift keying;propagation of uncertainty;interference;signal-to-noise ratio;spatial multiplexing;multiplexing;statistics;detection theory	Robotics	46.64189697113889	75.40030144631953	41693

To realize the potential performances of OFDM technique, it is essential to realize the higher accurate channel estimator. This paper first presents the problems of conventional channel estimator based on discrete fourier transform (DFT) method and then proposes a novel channel estimator on the basis of discrete cosine transform (DCT) method to overcome the problems of DFT method. The frequency interpolation method based on the DCT method is also proposed to provide the accurate and efficient channel estimator, which can be used in the OFDMA and MIMO systems of using the scattered pilot symbols. This work presents the theoretical and computer simulation results to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed DCT method as comparing with those for the conventional DFT method.	channel state information;computer simulation;discrete fourier transform;discrete cosine transform;frequency divider;interpolation;mimo;multipath propagation;multiplexing;performance	Hideo Kobayashi;Kazuo Mori	2004	2004 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (IEEE Cat.

As after digital wireless revolution made mobile phones available for everyone, the higher speeds and packet delivery of 4G networks will make high quality multimedia available everywhere. The key to achieving this higher level of service delivery is a new air interface, OFDM, which is in turn enabled by the high level of performance. OFDM provides a robust signal that requires relatively little power yet uses bandwidth very efficiently. Carriers will benefit from greater flexibility by using OFDM, since in the same spectrum they will be able to offer more channels, including higher-bandwidth channels, with more types of services. Currently these systems are still being defined and prototyped. Achieving higher data rates requires OFDM systems to make more efficient use of the bandwidth than CDMA systems. One method of achieving this higher efficiency is through the use of higher order modulation. In this paper we have compared two digital modulation techniques QPSK and DQPSK used for digital transmission of data. Our main objective to develop this configuration is to compare the performance of each modulation techniques. Comparison is done by Bit Error Rate analysis of both modulation techniques. We have developed existing configurations and improved them with high quality senders and receivers using MATLAB technology.	bit error rate;display resolution;high-level programming language;itil;matlab;mobile phone;modulation;network packet;next-generation network	B.

The proposed method first estimates the channel impulse response (CIR) with integrated IQ imbalance parameters, which contains twice the number of the original CIR parameters. To exploit the additional redundancy in the initial estimate, the alternating least square (ALS) algorithm is used to estimate the channel and the IQ imbalance parameters in an iterative manner. Particularly, the proposed method can exploit the beneficial linear structure of the initial estimate and largely reduce the required number of the estimated parameters, thereby enhancing the estimation performance. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed scheme in multipath fading channels even with severe IQ imbalance impairments.	algorithm;committed information rate;estimation theory;in-phase and quadrature components;iteration;iterative method;linear model;multipath propagation;numerical method;refinement (computing);simulation	Weikun Hou;Ming Jiang	2013	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2013.052413.130682	mobile telephony;telecommunications;mathematics;iterative method;estimation theory;transient response;statistics	Mobile	50.28350317924674	79.57518583325542	42039

The result is a diversity gain that is analogous to a conventional antenna array, only the array is distributed throughout the network. In quasi-static Rayleigh fading and for a target packet error probability of 10−2, the proposed technique allows a significant (18 dB) reduction in mobile transmit power when as many as six equidistant access points are used. This gain is reduced as the mobile moves closer to any one of the access points or if fewer access points are used. In addition, the role of ARQ and the impact of this reception technique on throughput is investigated.	bit error rate;bluetooth;data rate units;decibel;embedded system;interference (communication);network packet;rayleigh fading;return channel;telecommunications link;throughput;what if;wireless access point	Matthew C.

f0077bc3aca2c16c4f5ef2b1d64813d18b4bc998	relaying-enabled ultra-reliable low-latency communications in 5g		Supporting URLLC has become one of the major considerations in the design of 5G systems. In the literature, it has been shown that cooperative relaying is an efficient strategy to improve the reliability of transmissions, support higher rates, and lower latency. However, prior studies have demonstrated the performance advantages of relaying generally under the ideal assumption of communicating arbitrarily reliably at Shannon's channel capacity, which is not an accurate performance indicator for relaying in URLLC networks in which transmission is required to be completed within a strict time span and coding schemes with relatively short blocklengths need to be employed. In this article, we address the performance modeling and optimization of relaying-enabled URLLC networks. We first discuss the accurate performance modeling of relay-enabled 5G networks. In particular, we provide a comprehensive summary of the performance advantage of applying relaying in 5G URLLC transmissions in comparison to the case of direct transmission (without relaying). Both a noise-limited scenario and an interference- limited scenario are discussed. Then we present tools for performance optimization utilizing the knowledge of either perfect or average channel side information. Finally, we summarize the proposed optimization schemes and discuss potential future research directions.	channel capacity;interrupt latency;mathematical optimization;multi-user mimo;performance tuning;profiling (computer programming);relay;shannon (unit)	Yulin Hu;Mustafa Cenk Gursoy;Anke Schmeink	2018	IEEE Network	10.1109/MNET.2018.1700252	channel code;performance indicator;computer network;probability of error;latency (engineering);computer science;latency (engineering);channel capacity;communication channel	Metrics	31.118276563725523	76.18395195142382	42155

Iterative expressions for the evolution of the moments of the step size are derived and are used in conjunction with expressions for the mean square error to predict the learning curve. Expressions for the steady-state size, from which the steady-state mean square error can be found, are also developed. The analytical results are compared with simulation and good agreement is found. >		Joseph B.

This paper presents a maximum-likelihood-based CFO estimation algorithm for MIMO systems and its efficient hardware design. The proposed algorithm can accurately estimate the CFO, especially at high signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, the Cramer–Rao lower bound of the proposed method is derived as a performance guideline. In terms of hardware implementation, an efficient pipeline architecture is presented in detail, showing that the architecture only occupies minimal hardware resources so that it can be fitted into a small field-programmable gate array. The proposed architecture can be reconfigured according to different pilot lengths, making it flexible to various frame structures.	algorithm;carrier frequency;data structure;field-programmability;field-programmable gate array;frequency offset;mimo;pilot;pipeline (computing);signal-to-noise ratio;transmitter	Mingda Zhou;Zhe Feng;Youjian Liu;Xinming Huang	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2869114	mimo;architecture;hardware architecture;gate array;transmitter;carrier frequency offset;computer science;algorithm;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;signal-to-noise ratio	EDA	51.30691396211434	77.67242922253995	42350

From a detailed analysis of its variation with the coverage and reuse distances for different values of the Chanel Quality Indicator (CQI) and given empirical propagation models, an evaluation of the possible range for the reuse pattern is performed for the DL. By considering the CQI and reference CNIR requirements recommended by 3GPP, DL peak bit rates along with the Transport Block Size (TBS) assumed for single stream and bandwidth of 5 MHz, physical and supported throughputs are analysed. These formulations shows the clear decrease of the supported throughput for the longest coverage distances in the LTE 2.6 GHz band, a behaviour that is not so clear at 800 MHz, and gives useful indications to the optimization of the use of different frequency bands in the optimization of carrier aggregation between two different bands in LTE-A scenarios.	block size (cryptography);channel capacity;compaq lte;frequency band;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;mobile phone;modulation;requirement;software propagation;throughput	Fernando J.

We develop novel and accurate expressions for the symbol error probability (SEP) for fixed-gain amplify-and-forward relaying when the destination acquires CSI using the time-efficient cascaded channel estimation (CCE) protocol. The CCE protocol saves time by making the destination directly estimate the product of the source-relay and relay-destination channel gains. For a single relay system, we first develop a novel SEP expression and a tight SEP upper bound. We then similarly analyze an opportunistic multi-relay system, in which both selection and coherent demodulation use imperfect estimates. A distinctive aspect of our approach is the use of as few simplifying approximations as possible, which results in new results that are accurate at signal-to-noise-ratios as low as 1 dB for single and multi-relay systems. Using insights gleaned from an asymptotic analysis, we also present a simple, closed-form, nearly-optimal solution for allocation of energy between pilot and data symbols at the source and relay(s).	anisotropic filtering;approximation;carrier recovery;certified computer examiner;channel state information;coherence (physics);decibel;internet relay chat;mathematical optimization;profiling (computer programming);signal-to-noise ratio;symantec endpoint protection	Sachin Bharadwaj;Neelesh B.

Requirements for time of arrival (TOA) and time difference of arrival (TDOA) measurements have been specified in 3GPP LTE Rel. 9 to ensure accurate user equipment (UE) positioning even under bad conditions (e.g. with channel quickly varying and SNR being as low as 13 dB). To fulfil these requirements, it is vital to accurately estimate the first signal arriving path. In this work, we first derive without any approximation the Cramér–Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the LTE TOA and TDOA measurements based on the different pilots, which is shown to be as low as a few metres for SNR = 13 dB. The achievable performance of the LTE system is compared with the FCC and 3GPP requirements, and the impact of mobile multipath channels on the measurements is analysed. Then, we describe practical low-complexity methods for LTE TOA and TDOA measurements with enhanced first arriving path detection. The maximum likelihood based correlation profile is used as detection metric. After grossly determining the signal region by a moving window, three methods, namely, peak detection, SNR-based threshold and adaptive threshold based on noise floor and metric peak value are employed to estimate the first arriving path. Simulation results show that the proposed adaptive threshold-based method can meet all 3GPP requirements under various realistic mobile channels, and can in some cases achieve a performance close to the CRLB.

5f9ce4bbbc37e56735bd268ae09f090e156ba7e8	transmission delay minimization in wireless powered communication systems		Wirless powered communication (WPC) systems are a new type of communication systems which use wireless channel for both energy harvesting and data transmission. WPC systems are recently considered in literatures. In this type of telecommunications, delay transmission includes the time duration of both power transfer and data transmission. In the downlink (DL) phase, the power transfers from the base station to the node and in the uplink (UL) phase, the data is transmitted from the node to the base station. Minimization of transmission delay using the optimal time durations and the optimal allocated power at the base station is the goal of our paper. For this purpose, we define and solve two optimization problems and compare the results. In the first problem, an equal time durarion in the DL and UL phases and also the optimal power allocation at the base station are assumed. Then, in the second problem, a more general case with an unequal DL and UL time duration and optimal power allocation strategy at the base statio are considered.	mathematical optimization;multi-user;optimization problem;point-to-point protocol;radio frequency;telecommunications link;williams pinball controller;wireless access point	Mohammad Lari	2017	CoRR	10.1007/s11276-018-1778-0	computer network;communications system;transmission delay;round-trip delay time;wireless;telecommunications link;radio frequency power transmission;computer science;communication channel;optimization problem	Arch	32.59191261821455	86.33392849906895	42530

This paper studies a two-layer LDM with one layer used for providing a global service through a single frequency network (SFN), and the other for providing local coverage/services, such as location targeted advertising or local content insertion. The pilot boosting effect on SNR and co-channel interference is also analyzed. The LDM upper layer can be used to deliver time-division multiplexed mobile-HD and 4k-UHD services. The LDM lower layer with a negative SNR threshold can reliably provide seamless local coverage/service from each SFN transmitter without coverage gaps among adjacent SFN transmitter service areas. No directional receiving antenna is required for the local service reception and receivers simply tune into the stronger signal. In such LDM systems, while the upper layer is operating in a traditional SFN mode, the lower layer operates in a special form of distributed MIMO or gap-filler mode to provide targeted local coverage. For implementing the two-layer system introduced in this paper, only ATSC 3.0 baseline technologies are used, i.e., there is no need to modify the ATSC 3.0 standard. Given the upper and lower layers’ data rate requirements and the SNR thresholds, the lower layer power, with respect to the upper layer (injection level), can be optimized to maximize upper and lower layer performance and coverage. Since the advertisement time of the local service is typically less than 20% of the program time, nonreal time could be used to play-back the local content at five times the transmission bit rate for better (audio/video) service quality.	atsc 3.0;atsc standards;advanced television systems committee;baseline (configuration management);data rate units;interference (communication);mimo;modulation;multiplexing;propagation constant;requirement;seamless3d;signal-to-noise ratio;single-frequency network;star filler;transmitter;uncompressed video	Wei Li;Yiyan Wu;Liang Zhang;Khalil Salehian;S&#x00E9;bastien Lafl&#x00E8;che;Dazhi He;Yao Wang;Yunfeng Guan;Wenjun Zhang;Jon Montalban;Pablo Angueira;Manuel Maria Velez;Sung Ik Park;Jae-young Lee;Heung Mook Kim	2017	IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting	10.1109/TBC.2016.2630302	transmitter;electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;signal-to-noise ratio;broadcasting;computer network	Metrics	25.416610583548422	86.1158513045863	42535

The results reveal that the actual channel frequency response (CFR) is not a simple Fourier transform of the channel impulse response, due to sampling rate mismatch between the NB-IoT user and long term evolution (LTE) base station. Consequently, a new channel equalization algorithm is proposed based on the derived effective CFR.

Using the recently developed unique factorization of signals, several uniquely factorable constellation pairs (UFCPs) generated from cross quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations are chosen for transmission through all the transmitter antennas, with one random symbol acting as a coordinator to control all the symbols embedded in each coding matrix. The coding gains of collaborated orthogonal codes are calculated, and some optimal constellation pairs with maximum coding gains are presented, including orthogonal codes with different antennas and UFCPs with different groups. Despite the fact that the proposed code is nonlinear, a fast maximum likelihood (ML) decoding algorithm is developed, and its complexity is analyzed in detail. By comparing the decoding complexity of conventional Alamouti code, the ML algorithm, and the fast ML decoding algorithm of collaborative Alamouti code, it can be observed that the complexity of fast ML algorithm is still linear in terms of the square root of the cardinality of the cross QAM constellations with no performance loss. Computer simulations are performed to verify the performance of collaborative OSTBCs and the fast ML Algorithm under different conditions, and the results demonstrate that the average error rate of the collaborative nonlinear orthogonal codes outperforms that of the conventional OSTBCs.	algorithm;code;embedded system;modulation;nonlinear system;simulation;transmitter	Yi-Jun Zhu;Wen-Ya Wang;Jian-Kang Zhang;Yan-Yu Zhang	2017	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2016.2536060	transmitter;electronic engineering;quadrature amplitude modulation;space–time block code;constellation diagram;telecommunications;amplitude modulation;computer science;mathematics;encoding;collaboration	HPC	43.90645662690284	72.37464450905858	42566

The proposed encoder is based on a modification of MacKay encoding scheme. The introduced modification enables the application of MacKay scheme for quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC codes combined with a proposed matrix puncturing scheme based on an also proposed parity-check matrix construction to achieve code-rate compatibility. The proposed encoding scheme and VLSI encoder architecture address the problem of encoding complexity, since about 80% of MacKay encoding algorithm complexity is linearly depended on LDPC check node degree. The proposed matrix puncturing scheme can produce good BER performance especially for high puncturing rates, where only a few parity check symbols are transmitted. A comparison with prior art in puncturing is offered, which shows superior performance of the proposed scheme, in terms of coding gain without any hardware cost.	algorithm;code rate;coding gain;encoder;line code;low-density parity-check code;parity bit;parity-check matrix;puncturing;rc circuit;very-large-scale integration;x.690	Ahmed Mahdi;Nikos Kanistras;Vassilis Paliouras	2011	2011 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)	10.1109/SiPS.2011.6088997	discrete mathematics;low-density parity-check code;noise;theoretical computer science;coding gain;hardware architecture;mathematics;encoding;statistics	Vision	42.98416445304353	61.90211854097768	42572

If the sensor-estimator channel is perfect, it is also calculated. Further properties are discussed. The problem of estimating a dynamical system with nonstochastic disturbances is studied where the sensor is connected to the estimator and an eavesdropper via an uncertain wiretap channel. The estimator should obtain a uniformly bounded estimation error whereas the eavesdropper's error should tend to infinity. It is proved that the system can be estimated securely if the zero-error capacity of the sensor-estimator channel is strictly larger than the logarithm of the system's unstable pole and the zero-error secrecy capacity of the uncertain wiretap channel is positive.	control theory;dynamical system;error detection and correction	Moritz Wiese;Karl Henrik Johansson;Tobias J.

005a6fe8701d6c22c1df149c41a18c66851fbb28	unilateral left-tail anderson darling test based spectrum sensing with laplacian noise		This paper focuses on spectrum sensing under Laplacian noise. To remit the negative effects caused by heavytailed behavior of Laplacian noise, the fractional lower order moments (FLOM) technology is employed to pre-process the received samples before spectrum sensing. Via exploiting the asymmetrical difference between the distribution for the FLOM of received samples in the absence and presence of primary users, we formulate the spectrum sensing problem under Laplacian noise as a unilateral goodness-of-fit (GoF) test problem. Based on this test problem, we propose a new GoF-based detector which is called unilateral left-tail Anderson Darling (ULAD) detector. The analytical expressions for the theoretical performance, in terms of false-alarm and detection probabilities, of the ULAD are derived. Moreover, a closed-form expression for the optimal detection threshold is also derived to minimize the total error rate. Simulation results are provided to validate the theoretical analyses and to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed detector than others.

In addition, this paper introduces and verifies two other antenna selection methods for comparison. For the sake of simplicity, three orthogonal dipoles are considered, and this antenna configuration using the proposed selection method is compared to an antenna configuration with three vertical or horizontal dipoles. In the proposed antenna selection method, we always choose the vertical dipole, and choose one of two horizontal dipoles, which are orthogonal to each other, based on the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). We measured the MU-MIMO transmission properties and found that the proposed selection method employing the antenna with orthogonal polarizations and patterns can offer fairly high channel capacity in a multiuser scenario.

0134a7fb42d65f220965dc4661eae6e07cb0e1da	asymptotic converse bound for secret key capacity in hidden markov model		Secret key establishment from common randomness has been traditionally investigated under cartain limiting assumptions, of which the most ubiquitous appears to be that the information available to all parties comes in the form of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples of some correlated random variables. Unfortunately, models employing the i.i.d assumption are often not accurate representations of real scenarios. A more capable model would represent the available information as correlated hidden Markov models (HMMs), based on the same underlying Markov chain. Such a model accurately reflects the scenario where all parties have access to imperfect observations of the same source random process, exhibiting a certain time dependency. In this paper, we derive a computationally-efficient asymptotic converse bound for the secret key capacity of the correlated-HMM scenario. The main obstacle, not only for our model, but also for other non-i.i.d cases, is the computational complexity. We address this by converting the initial bound to a product of Markov random matrices, and using recent results regarding its convergence to a Lyapunov exponent. The methods developed in the paper are easily extensible to derive a secret-key capacity lower bound.	asymptote;computational complexity theory;hidden markov model;key (cryptography);key exchange;lyapunov fractal;markov chain;public-key cryptography;randomness;stochastic process	Mohammad Reza Khalili Shoja;George T.

However, large numbers of secondary users participating in cooperative spectrum sensing result in extensive overhead due to sensing reporting and sensing decision. Additionally, spatial correlation among secondary users can decrease the sensing performance. In this paper, we develop an adaptive user selection mechanism for cooperative spectrum sensing without any information about secondary user location or distance among different users. Additionally, to decrease the effect of spatial correlation to sensing performance, we presents an effective parameter to evaluate that correlation relationship. Numerical results show that the performance of cooperative spectrum sensing achieves improvement and the overhead can be decreased under our proposed user adaptive user selection mechanism.	cooperative mimo;numerical method;overhead (computing)	Fuhui Zhou;Yuquan Li;Jiangbo Si;Benjian Hao;Peihan Qi	2015	2015 International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems (CITS)	10.1109/CITS.2015.7297716	cognitive radio;electronic engineering;simulation;telecommunications;engineering	Mobile	48.02337633627633	87.52593086066594	42685

By implementing combining weights that are constant across a time slot but are updated from slot-to-slot (i.e., quasi-static), great computational complexity savings can be realized compared to calculating new weights at each data block within a time slot. The quasi-static weights are computed by first modeling the timevarying channel for each user as the superposition of multiple time-invariant channels, called Doppler channels. The weights are then calculated based on all users Doppler channels. These new weights work by using some of the degrees of freedom of the antenna array to suppress time variations as well as multiple access interference. Despite being fixed across a time slot, these weights can equalize and suppress SDMA interference even when the channel varies significantly over the slot. Simulation results show the effectiveness of these weights for equalization and interference suppression.	array processing;computation;computational complexity theory;interference (communication);mimo;multi-user;simulation;standard database management analysis;time-invariant system;zero suppression	Timothy A.

We refer this model to as Non-Orthogonal MARC (NOMARC), which better leverages the broadcast nature of the radio channel than its more conservative orthogonal counterpart, i.e., Orthogonal MARC (OMARC). This paper aims at measuring the advantage brought by NOMARC/JNCC over OMARC/JNCC from both an information-theoretic and a practical code design perspectives.	code;downtime;duplex (telecommunications);forward error correction;information theory;linear network coding;numerical analysis;relay channel;shortest path problem;sun outage;turbo code	Atoosa Hatefi;Raphaël Visoz;Antoine O.

For differential phase-shift-keying (DPSK) or differentially encoded coherent biphaseshift-keying (DE-BPSK), the paired error tendency precludes the simpler computational approach used, for example for straight BPSK, if precise results are required. In this paper, the exact expression for the probability of a packet error is derived for both DPSK and DE-BPSK. I t is shown that ignoring the paired error tendency and using the simpler independent bit error assumption yields an upper bound which, for large packet sizes, is in error by no more than approximately 0.1 dB for DPSK and 0.2 dB for DE-BPSK. An excellent approximation is derived for both cases that is useful for precise results .	approximation;bit error rate;coherence (physics);differential phase;key (cryptography);network packet	James A.

We present a new analysis of the hidden node area in a broadcast network and compare broadcast outage probabilities for various traffic loads and carrier sense ranges. According to our model, the propagation environment (in particular the path loss exponent) has a major influence on performance. The traffic load and carrier sense range also affect throughput. A large attempted traffic load per carrier sense is preferred, since this gives the best performance.	downtime;loss function;software propagation;throughput	Jean-Paul M. G.

The system employs a three-phase relaying protocol with direct transmissions, where two terminals transmit separately in the first two phases. In the third phase, the relay forwards the network coded message to both terminals only if it has successfully decoded both messages received from the terminals. At the destination nodes, SNR-dependent thresholds are proposed to allow only the received signal from the relay corresponding to when it transmits to be combined with the signal from the direct link. Monte Carlo simulation results for fast fading channels show the performance gains of this relaying scheme with W-DFDC receivers over conventional differential detectors.	cdd;coherent;computer simulation;correctness (computer science);error floor;inline linking;modulation;monte carlo method;relay;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Junqian Zhang;Harry Leib	2016	2016 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)	10.1109/CCECE.2016.7726607	communications protocol;detector;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;relay channel;computer network;modulation	Vision	34.72744633944872	77.00781742276874	42795

In this paper, we propose an adaptive SBIP algorithm with variable candidate set and statistically derived threshold for pruning. By analyzing the upper bound of accumulated metric, the range of candidate set is calculated. The probability distribution is also derived for statistical pruning of the tree search. Applying these ideas, the number of undesirable node visit is significantly reduced. Monte-Carlo simulations show that the proposed algorithm considerably reduces the computational complexity whereas the performance is close to that of sphere encoder (SE).	algorithm;alpha–beta pruning;bit error rate;computational complexity theory;encoder;iterative method;multi-user mimo;simulation;stack-oriented programming language;telecommunications link;x.690	Kyungho Park;Jongsub Cha;Joonhyuk Kang	2008	2008 IEEE 19th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2008.4699457	computer simulation;mathematical optimization;theoretical computer science;mathematics;statistics;monte carlo method	Arch	45.49054051686278	71.05151653532933	42888

Dynamic time-division duplex (TDD) has the capability to accommodate to the traffic asymmetry by adapting the UL/DL configuration to the current traffic demands. In this work, we study a two-tier heterogeneous cellular network (HCN) where the macro tier and small cell tier operate according to a dynamic TDD scheme on orthogonal frequency bands. To offload the network infrastructure, mobile users in proximity can engage in device-to-device (D2D) communications, whose activity is determined by a carrier sensing multiple access (CSMA) scheme to protect the ongoing infrastructure-based and D2D transmissions. We present an analytical framework for evaluating the network performance in terms of load-aware coverage probability and network throughput. The proposed framework allows quantification of the effect on the coverage probability of the most important TDD system parameters, such as the UL/DL configuration, the base station density, and the bias factor. In addition, we evaluate how the bandwidth partition and the D2D network access scheme affect the total network throughput. Through the study of the tradeoff between coverage probability and D2D user activity, we provide guidelines for the optimal design of D2D network access.	access network;duplex (telecommunications);frequency band;multitier architecture;network performance;optimal design;telecommunications link;test-driven development;throughput	Hongguang Sun;Matthias Wildemeersch;Min Sheng;Tony Q.

The proposed scheme selects the first Lc arbitrary ordered relays out of L relays such that the maximal ratio combined signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) of the Lc relayed paths and the direct path barely exceeds a preset threshold. Closed-form expressions are derived for the cumulative distribution function, the probability density function, and the moment generating function of an output SNR upper bound for independent and identically distributed Rayleigh fading. Lower bounds for the outage probability, the average symbol error rate, and the average number of selected relays are also derived. Moreover, upper bounds for the average output SNR and the ergodic capacity are also derived. The analytical results are verified via the Monte- Carlo simulation. The performance of our proposed scheme is compared to that of the existing relay selection schemes.

Without modifying the architecture of legacy receivers, supplementary data can be transmitted via an added layer superimposed onto the legacy layer, and the resultant increase of transmission power is only a small fraction of that used by the legacy system. To obtain the upper bounds for the achievable throughputs, the modulation constrained capacities are derived for this layered transmission scheme. We formulate the hierarchical constellation design as a nonlinear optimization problem and then solve it through a simplified numerical method, which searches for the appropriate power allocation ratio in one-dimension space. Finally, to examine the inter-operability of channel encoder/decoder between DVB-S2 and DVB-C2, we investigate the error performance of the proposed scheme employing the LDPC codes given by DVB-S2 standard.	bch code;backward compatibility;cobham's thesis;coding theory;concatenated error correction code;dvb-s2;delta-sigma modulation;digital video broadcasting;encoder;forward error correction;interoperability;legacy system;low-density parity-check code;mathematical optimization;modulation;mutual information;next-generation network;noisy-channel coding theorem;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;numerical method;operability;optimization problem;qr code;resultant	Jing Lei;Wen Gao	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2008.376	low-density parity-check code;telecommunications;numerical analysis;nonlinear programming;computer science;theoretical computer science;statistics	EDA	38.9473925485041	86.37929822446223	42927

However, most MIMO relay techniques require high complexity equalizers and error free forwarding at the relay to collect diversity. In this paper, we propose high-rate and low-complexity decode-and-forward (DF) MIMO relay designs that achieve cooperative diversity, receive diversity or joint diversity. We introduce a power-scaling strategy for MIMO relays to enable cooperative diversity. Zero-forcing equalizers are employed at both relay and destination to maintain low-complexity. We also develop a channel-controlled ARQ scheme to collect receive diversity. Through mathematical analysis, we prove the diversity order achieved by each proposed design and numerical simulations confirm the theoretical claims.	automatic repeat request;cc system;computer simulation;direction finding;image scaling;mimo;mimo-ofdm;numerical analysis;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral efficiency;x.690	Giwan Choi;Wei Zhang;Xiaoli Ma	2012	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2012.041212.110037	computer simulation;zero forcing equalizer;laser power scaling;3g mimo;electronic engineering;telecommunications;numerical analysis;computer science;probability of error;mathematics;cooperative diversity;relay channel;automatic repeat request;statistics;computer network;mimo	Mobile	36.992883867547356	75.98180099571908	42939

These properties are essential for quantum turbo code families to have a minimum distance growing with blocklength and for their iterative decoding algorithm to converge, respectively. Here, we show that the entanglement-assisted paradigm simplifies the theory of quantum turbo codes, in the sense that an entanglement-assisted quantum (EAQ) convolutional encoder can possess both of the aforementioned desirable properties. We give several examples of EAQ convolutional encoders that are both recursive and non-catastrophic and detail their relevant parameters. We then modify the quantum turbo decoding algorithm of Poulin , in order to have the constituent decoders pass along only extrinsic information to each other rather than a posteriori probabilities as in the decoder of Poulin , and this leads to a significant improvement in the performance of unassisted quantum turbo codes. Other simulation results indicate that entanglement-assisted turbo codes can operate reliably in a noise regime 4.73 dB beyond that of standard quantum turbo codes, when used on a memoryless depolarizing channel. Furthermore, several of our quantum turbo codes are within 1 dB or less of their hashing limits, so that the performance of quantum turbo codes is now on par with that of classical turbo codes. Finally, we prove that entanglement is the resource that enables a convolutional encoder to be both non-catastrophic and recursive because an encoder acting on only information qubits, classical bits, gauge qubits, and ancilla qubits cannot simultaneously satisfy them.	algorithm;ancilla bit;bit error rate;computational resource;computer science;concatenation;converge;convolutional code;convolutional neural network;degeneracy (graph theory);email;encoder;error detection and correction;feedback;forward error correction;image scaling;information theory;interaction;iterative method;jean;maximal set;programming paradigm;qr code;quantum depolarizing channel;quantum entanglement;quantum error correction;qubit;recursion;shannon (unit);simulation;state diagram;turbo code;word error rate	Mark M.

This method includes an adaptive pilot transmission mechanism, robust noise reduction and decision-directed channel estimation. An improved practical AM scheme is used to test the proposed DANR method. Since this method maintains low pilot rates, it results in higher SE than previously proposed noise reduction (NR) techniques, which rely on oversampled pilots. These conclusions are confirmed for practical prediction ranges using the standard Jakes model and our realistic physical model.	channel state information;modulation;noise reduction;spectral efficiency	Tao Jia;Alexandra Duel-Hallen;Hans Hallen	2008	2008 42nd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems	10.1109/CISS.2008.4558694	telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics;fading;statistics	EDA	49.19419089819097	77.00282848968659	43053

We pose the problem as a multicast throughput optimization problem. As a solution we present how one can jointly utilize fixed-rate and rateless erasure coding along with simple rate adaptation techniques in order to achieve the optimal multicast throughput per user. We first investigate the performance of the proposed system under i.i.d. channel conditions. Our analysis shows a linear gain for the multicast capacity over i.i.d. Rayleigh fading channels with respect to the number of users. Since the established results require coding over large number of blocks and hence induce large decoding delays, we extend our analysis to the cases where we code over shorter block lengths and thus quantify the delay-capacity tradeoffs under a simple setting. We further look into non-i.i.d. channel conditions and show achievable gains by modifying a scheduling heuristic whose fairness is well- established for opportunistic scheduling of unicast flows. Our overall evaluations demonstrate that under both i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. channel conditions, opportunistic multicasting with erasure coding can significantly improve the performance over the traditional techniques used in today's communication systems.	erasure code;fairness measure;heuristic;mathematical optimization;multicast;optimization problem;rayleigh fading;scheduling (computing);throughput;unicast	Ulas C.

The mandatory mode of 2.4 GHz physical layer of IEEE802.15.4 standard employs offset quadrature phase shift keying (OQPSK) modulation with direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS). The performance of conventional differential demodulator is not satisfactory. The coherent demodulator is vulnerable to initial phase mismatch or frequency offset. In this paper, we propose a new non-coherent demodulator for the OQPSK–DSSS system. The proposed demodulator is robust against initial phase mismatch and frequency offset. At −1.3 dB SNR in additive white Gaussian noise channel, the proposed demodulator achieves the target sensitivity at 1 % packet error rate. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed demodulator. S. Dai · H. Qian (B) · K.

0c7bda134747a1ac80489f4ff4f460bd3637f6f1	a channel-blind detection for scma based on image processing techniques		Sparse-code multiple-access (SCMA) is an effective non-orthogonal multiple-access (NOMA) technique. Existing detectors such as deterministic message passing algorithm (DMPA) are one-dimensional and require precise channel estimation. This paper proposes a blind detector from a two-dimensional perspective. Main work involves pattern construction and pre-filtering with different image techniques. In this paper, a 4 × 4 Sudoku template is applied for the pattern construction of one-dimensional SCMA signals. Total variation based on first order differential operator is adopted for global pre-filtering of DMPA. Image training is adopted in DMPA to further reduce the environment noise. The output signal of both pre-filtering methods are detect through DMPA with constant noise density N0. Numerical results show that two-dimensional blind detection can well compensate the performance when channel estimation of DMPA is not perfect. A general hardware architecture of the detecting method is also proposed in this paper.	algorithm;application-specific integrated circuit;channel state information;ibm notes;image processing;message passing;neural coding;secure real-time transport protocol;sensor;sparse;sudoku	Chao Yang;Weihong Xu;Zaichen Zhang;Xiaohu You;Chuan Zhang	2018	2018 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2018.8351827	image processing;message passing;differential operator;computer hardware;hardware architecture;electronic engineering;noise reduction;constant noise;computer science;detector;communication channel	Vision	47.131999533040904	66.56480196960266	43162

A follow-on adaptive signal canceler may be used to perform direction finding of the source captured by the array. In this paper, we analyze the convergence and tracking properties of the CM array using a least-mean-square approximation. Expressions are derived for the misadjustment of the adaptive algorithms, and a tracking model is developed that accurately predicts the behavior of the system during fades. It is demonstrated that the adaptive canceler contributes more to the overall misadjustment than does the adaptive CM beamformer. Computer simulations are presented to illustrate the transient properties of the system and to verify the analytical results.	modulus of continuity	Arvind V. Keerthi;Amit Mathur;John J.

This paper analyzes the performance with different relay selections which include partial relay selection and opportunistic relay selection in amplify-and-forward (AF) cooperative network with hardware impairments. Partial relay selection is that the relay node is selected depending on the instantaneous channel information of source-relay hop. Opportunistic relay selection is that the relay node is selected depending on the whole instantaneous channel information. And, the exact closed-form expression for the outage probability and the approximate expression for the ergodic capacity of AF relaying network with hardware impairments are derived over Rayleigh fading channel, which provides a fast and efficient means to evaluate the impact of hardware impairments on the system performance. In addition, simulation results and intuitive discussions are provided to show the correctness of the analytical results.	anisotropic filtering;approximation algorithm;correctness (computer science);distortion;downtime;ergodicity;rayleigh fading;relay;simulation;transceiver	Kefeng Guo;Jin Chen;Yuzhen Huang;Guoxin Li;Nian Liu	2014	2014 International Workshop on High Mobility Wireless Communications	10.1109/HMWC.2014.7000218	electronic engineering;link access procedure for frame relay;telecommunications;engineering;relay channel;computer network	Metrics	36.3169527885475	79.81527437697285	43350

As a result, they are well approximated by a simple horizontal shift (or gain) of the distribution of the most tractable model, the Poisson point process (PPP). To study and explain this behavior, this paper focuses on general single-tier network models with nearest-base station association and studies the asymptotic gain both at 0 and at infinity. We show that the gain at 0 is determined by the so-called mean interference-to-signal ratio (MISR) between the PPP and the network model under consideration, while the gain at infinity is determined by the expected fading-to-interference ratio (EFIR). The analysis of the MISR is based on a novel type of point process, the so-called relative distance process, which is a one-dimensional point process on the unit interval [0,1] that fully determines the SIR. A comparison of the gains at 0 and infinity shows that the gain at 0 indeed provides an excellent approximation for the entire SIR distribution. Moreover, the gain is mostly a function of the network geometry and barely depends on the path loss exponent and the fading. The results are illustrated using several examples of repulsive point processes.	approximation algorithm;cobham's thesis;interference (communication);multitier architecture;network model;point process	Radha Krishna Ganti;Martin Haenggi	2016	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2015.2498926	mathematical optimization;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;telecommunications;gain;computer science;base station;lattice;mathematics;wireless;statistics	Vision	28.766482864772502	84.31553594092213	43530

Our main technical contributions are a tight quantum sphere-packing bound, obtained via Chaganty and Sethuraman’s concentration inequality in strong large deviation theory, and asymptotic expansions of error-exponent functions. Moderate deviation analysis for quantum hypothesis testing is also established. The converse directly follows from our channel coding result, while the achievability relies on a martingale inequality."""	channel capacity;error exponent;hamming bound;norm (social);quantum mechanics;set packing;social inequality	Hao-Chung Cheng;Min-Hsiu Hsieh	2018	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2017.2781254	calculus;mathematics;mathematical economics;statistics	Theory	35.67805708568738	63.96442103060063	43532

The physical layer is modeled as a concatenation of a broadcast and a multiple access channel. We find the optimal offline transmit power and rate allocations that maximize the end-to-end throughput. First, we show that there exists an optimal source power allocation which is equal to the single-user optimal power allocation for the source energy arrivals and does not depend on the relay energy arrivals. Second, we show that the fraction of the power spent on each broadcast link depends on the energy arrivals for the relays. Specifically, we show that the optimal source rate allocation can be found by solving an optimal broadcasting problem with slot-dependent user priorities and these priorities can change only at instants where one of the relay data buffers is empty. Finally, we decompose the problem into inner and outer optimization problems and solve the overall problem by iterating between the two.	broadcast domain;concatenation;end-to-end principle;iteration;mathematical optimization;multi-user;online and offline;relay;throughput	Berk Gurakan;Sennur Ulukus	2015	2015 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	10.1109/ISIT.2015.7282953	transmitter;throughput;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;energy harvesting	Arch	32.74395162861215	85.76011835429081	43566

Specifically, we consider practical passive eavesdropping scenarios, where the channel state information of the eavesdropper’s link is not available at the secondary transmitter. In order to avoid interfering with the primary receiver and enhance the secrecy performance, collaborative distributed beamforming is adopted at the secondary relays. Closed-form and asymptotic expressions for the secrecy outage probability of CCRNs in the presence of single and multiple non-colluding eavesdroppers are derived. The asymptotic analysis reveals that the achievable secrecy diversity order of collaborative distributed beamforming withM AF relays isM− 1 regardless of the number of eavesdroppers. In addition, simulations are conducted to validate the accuracy of our analytical results.	beamforming;channel state information;cognitive radio;rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method;relay;simulation;sun outage;transmitter	Weifeng Mou;Weiwei Yang;Yuzhen Huang;Xiaoming Xu;Yueming Cai;Kaihua Wang	2017	EURASIP J.

The problem is investigated based on the framework of the channel resolvability theory. The information-spectrum method introduced by Han and Verdu is first generalized to an arbitrary interference channel to obtain a direct channel resolvability result. The derived resolvability results are then shown to be the achievable strong secrecy rates for the stationary and memoryless interference channel. Our results provide further evidence that channel resolvability can be a powerful and general framework for strong secrecy analysis in multiuser networks.	channel (communications);confidentiality;han unification;interference (communication);multi-user;stationary process;strong secrecy;transmitter;utility functions on indivisible goods	Zhao Wang;Rafael F.

Hence, minimizing the power dissipation in the receiver front end, which, in many cases, is the prominent power consuming part of the receiver, is an important challenge. This paper addresses this challenge by solving two closely related optimization problems. Firstly, we optimize the overall power dissipation in an RF front end consisting of a chain of building blocks to satisfy required overall specifications in gain, linearity and noise figure. We extend this into a second optimization problem, namely to maximize the transmission rate that the receiver can accommodate for a given available receiver battery power budget. In fact, the ratio of this transmission rate vs the available receiver power budget serves as the figure-of-merit that allows a formal optimization where, in particular, the (adjacent channel) interference is a critical factor. Our results include closed-form analytical solutions for certain cases. For high signal power, where the noise is limited by interference, the largest bit/s/Hz per nJ drawn from receiver is reached for a transmission rate of 2.3 bits/s/Hz, irrespective of interference power. Numerical results using practical circuit blocks with 90 nm and 65 nm technologies are in close agreement with the analytical results.	benchmark (computing);cpu power dissipation;channel (communications);channel capacity;die (integrated circuit);interference (communication);mathematical optimization;modulation;noise figure;nonlinear system;numerical method;numerical partial differential equations;optimization problem;radio frequency;requirement;robustness (computer science);signal-to-noise ratio;transmitter	Johan H.

We analyzed single-carrier signals with QPSK and 16-QAM signal constellations. The ISI is introduced by the optimal finite pulses obtained by the linear optimization. The criterion of the optimization problem was maximization of the free Euclidean distance under a fixed bandwidth comprising 99% of signal power and for the chosen constellation. We used the sphere decoding (SD) algorithm for the signal detection under assumption of additive white Gaussian noise channel. The simulation results have shown that the maximal increase of bandwidth efficiency is provided when the ISI introduction is utilized simultaneously with the increase of signal constellation size.	algorithmic efficiency;information sciences institute	Van Phe Nguyen;Anton Gorlov;Aleksandr Gelgor	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-67380-6_61	phase-shift keying;additive white gaussian noise;detection theory;constellation diagram;decoding methods;algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);spectral efficiency;mathematics;electronic engineering;communication channel	ML	46.288398117693745	79.30798496216607	43753

DPIM code characteristics, power spectral density and error probability in terms of the packet error rate are discussed. Performance comparison is made with that of on}o! keying (OOK) and pulse position modulation (PPM). For comparison, relevant expressions for both OOK and PPM are also presented. Using a threshold-detector-based receiver, we show that DPIM outperforms both OOK and PPM in terms of power e$ciency and PPM in terms of bandwidth e$ciency, by taking advantage of its inherent variable symbol duration. However, using a maximum-a posteriori (MAP) detector it provides marginally inferior error rate performance compared with PPM.

In the hybrid scheme, a secondary user (SU) as well as a cognitive relay works either in underlay or in overlay mode. In underlay, the transmit power of the SU as well as the relay is limited by the maximum acceptable interference at primary user (PU) receiver as required by an outage constraint of PU, a quality of service for PU. The secondary network consists of a decode and forward relay that harvests energy from radio frequency signal of secondary transmitter as well as PU transmitter to assist the SU in forwarding the information signal to the destination. A time switching relaying protocol is used at the relay. We evaluate the secrecy outage probability of secondary relay network assuming that channel state information of the interfering links from both the SU and relay transmitter to PU receiver is imperfect. Our results reveal the impact of imperfect channel state information, energy harvesting time, tolerable interference threshold, and PU outage constraint on the secrecy outage probability of SU.	downtime;internet relay chat	Pranabesh Maji;Sanjay Dhar Roy;Sumit Kundu	2017	Int.

Receivers based on this architecture use e.g. a temporal or spatio-temporal Rake, beamspace processing, or eigenvalue decomposition. Their performance critically depends on a good choice of the spatio-temporal rank. We define the effective spatio-temporal rank based on the mean square error (MSE) of the receiver’s rednced rank channel estimate. Thus, we can determine the optimum rank and get an analytical insight in the fundamental trade-offs involved, when designing such systems. Using this criterion we discuss under which conditions beamfonning is optimal compared to diversity combining.	mean squared error;rake	Frank A.

Like the most well-known redundancy bounds for minimum average redundancy coding-Huffman coding-these are in terms of a form of entropy and/or the probability of an input symbol, often the most probable one. The bounds here, some of which are tight, improve on known bounds of the form L ∈ [H,H+1), where H is some form of entropy in bits (or, in the case of redundancy objectives, 0) and L is the length objective, also in bits. The objectives explored here include exponential-average length, maximum pointwise redundancy, and exponential-average pointwise redundancy (also called dth exponential redundancy). The first of these relates to various problems involving queueing, uncertainty, and lossless communications; the second relates to problems involving Shannon coding and universal modeling. Also explored here for these two objectives is the related matter of individual codeword length.	alphabet (formal languages);binary prefix;code word;huffman coding;lossless compression;nonlinear system;prefix code;redundancy (information theory);shannon coding;time complexity	Michael B.

Different from the single carrier transmission scheme, OFDM system is extremely sensitive to the carrier frequency offset (CFO). Several frequency estimation methods have been proposed to extract and compensate the CFO. However, conventional estimation methods get some trouble in correctly extracting the integer CFO in strong echo channels. In this paper, a novel frequency estimation method, using PN sequence embedded in frequency domain OFDM data, is introduced for time-domain synchronous OFDM. The method uses correlation result between PN sequence and OFDM data to extract the integer CFO. Simulation result proves that the new method precisely extract the integer CFO in various channels almost without interference on data.	carrier frequency offset;cross-correlation;embedded system;frequency divider;interference (communication);kernel density estimation;multipath propagation;multiplexing;pseudorandom number generator;sensor;simulation;spectral density estimation	Shuai Zhang;Chao Zhang;Chang-Yong Pan	2015	2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7145730	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering	Embedded	50.678168321358484	78.60588506596822	43923

In the downlink, a single burst using network coding is addressed to both users. Applying the proposed technique to mobile-to-mobile applications, the radio resources are used very efficiently since the network capacity is almost doubled and the radio resource management is simplified so that message delivery time is halved.	algorithm;centralized computing;duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);iterative method;linear network coding;location awareness;mobile app;multi-user;radio resource management;telecommunications link;turbo code	Panagiotis Fines;Ekaterini Christofylaki;Hamid Aghvami	2011	2011 18th International Conference on Telecommunications	10.1109/CTS.2011.5898938	turbo code;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Visualization	38.418571106083185	83.32635736474208	43926

It is shown that the use of the linear precoding enhances the separability of the EXIT planes of the simultaneous streams over without precoding; This invokes the idea that different code rate be allocated to the each transmitted streams at the transmitter.

Cooperative spectrum sensing is therefore suggested to enhance the reliability of such detection. However, it renders another significant problem of increased detection delay and traffic burden. Moreover, efficient schemes for multi-sensor data fusion should be designed. In this paper, we employ sequential detection scheme together with ordered transmissions from cognitive detectors. We derive two sequential schemes, one that is capable of achieving the minimum probability of error, and another that trades-off performance with delay. For the latter we derive expressions for the likelihood functions of ordered observations and compute the thresholds via backward induction. Simulation results demonstrate the relative performance of the approaches proposed in the paper.	backward induction;cognitive radio;rendering (computer graphics);sensor;simulation	Laila Hesham;Ahmed Sultan;Mohammed Nafie;Fadel F.

The base station selects only one secondary user, which maximizes the weighted difference between the channel power gains of the interference link and the cognitive transmission link. This selection strategy can also be specialized to selecting the secondary user that has either the least interference channel gain or the highest data channel gain. Consequently, the selected secondary user is subject to an interference power constraint in order to avoid harmful interference inflicted on the primary user. It is assumed that the primary user and secondary users operate under statistical quality of service (QoS) constraints imposed as limitations on the buffer size. In this setting, we characterize the effective capacity for both primary user and the secondary users under different selection methods. The impacts of the secondary user selection method, the number of secondary users, QoS constraints on the performance of both the primary user and secondary users are investigated. We interestingly show that for a large number of secondary users, the performance of the primary user is not affected by the selection method in the interference-limited regime.	channel (communications);cognition;interference (communication);profiling (computer programming);quality of service;selection (genetic algorithm)	Gozde Ozcan;Mustafa Cenk Gursoy	2013	2013 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2013.6831662	transmitter;cognitive radio;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;wireless;computer network	Mobile	34.50697280455143	86.66784726970407	44142

Arrival time difference between multiple transmit antennas by multipaths causes not only inter-symbol interference but also multiple-access interference and inter-antenna interference between the desired signals transmitted from different antennas. To mitigate the effect of the interferences a joint algorithm for the proposed scheme is presented, in which an adaptation process for the AIC is merged in the conventional ML decoding algorithm.

The area power consumption is considered as the system energy consumption metric in this paper and the area power consumption given a target area spectral efficiency is analyzed in a single cell assisted by circularly located relays. We introduce a novel power model of the relay assisted systems at first. And then, the power consumption in the single cell assisted by relays is discussed. The direct transmission and two-hop transmission schemes are introduced at first and then an energy efficient mode switching scheme based on the different user's location is proposed. The area power consumption of the three schemes is derived. Finally, the effect of different system parameters such as cell radius, relay position, relay number and area spectral efficiency to the area power consumption is discussed.	interference (communication);network planning and design;relay;simulation;spectral efficiency	Jie Xu	2010	2010 IEEE/ACM Int'l Conference on Green Computing and Communications & Int'l Conference on Cyber, Physical and Social Computing	10.1109/GreenCom-CPSCom.2010.32	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	27.57923662594912	86.3009990669461	44445

Quantized indexing (QI) is a fast and space-efficient form of enumerative (combinatorial) coding (EC). The arithmetic precision, execution time, table sizes and coding delay of EC are all reduced by a factor O(n) at a redundancy below log(e)/2g-1 bits/symbol (for n input symbols and a g-bit QI precision). Due to its tighter enumeration, QI redundancy is below that of arithmetic coding (AC). The relative compression gains increase for shorter outputs and for less predictable data. Simultaneously, QI is significantly faster than the fastest arithmetic coders, from factor 6 in high to over 200 in low entropy limit ('typically' 10 to 20 times faster). These speedups are the result of using no coding operations on more probable symbol, fewer and simpler operations on less probable symbol and intrinsically cleaner division of labor between the coder and modeler	arithmetic coding;fastest;run time (program lifecycle phase);significant figures	Ratko V.

A sequence of inner bounds to the DMN capacity region is derived by using code trees. Capacity expressions are given for three classes of DMNs: (1) a single-letter expression for a class with a common output, (2) a two-letter expression for a binary-symmetric broadcast channel (BC) with partial feedback, and (3) a finite-letter expression for push-to-talk DMNs. The first result is a consequence of a new capacity outer bound for common output DMNs. The third result demonstrates that the common practice of using a time-sharing random variable does not include all time-sharing possibilities, namely, time sharing of channels. Several techniques for improving the bounds are developed: (1) causally conditioned entropy and directed information simplify the inner bounds, (2) code trellises serve as simple code trees, (3) superposition coding and binning with code trees improves rates. Numerical computations show that the last technique enlarges the best known rate regions for a multiple-access channel (MAC) and a BC, both with feedback. In addition to the rate bounds, a sequence of inner bounds to the DMN reliability function is derived. A numerical example for a two-way channel illustrates the behavior of the error exponents.

In this letter, the channel estimation and user activity detection problems in the DIDO system are studied. We notice that there are two types of sparsity in DIDO systems: The first is the sparsity of user equipment (UE) activities, and the second is the spatial sparsity of UE signals. In response, a two-stage compressed sensing process is proposed in which UE activities and the overall channel states from active UEs to the baseband unit pool are identified at the first stage, and channel states from active UEs to remote radio heads are estimated at the second stage. A low-complexity method is proposed to accelerate the process in the first stage. Simulation results are also presented to show the performance of the proposed approach.	baseband;channel state information;compressed sensing;radio access network;simulation;sparse matrix	Qi He;Zhi Chen;Tony Q.

Second, it suffers from line-of-sight (LOS) uncertainty with channel parameters fluctuating sharply between LOS and non-LOS conditions. In this paper, we address these problems by taking the distance as a random variable and by introducing a room-density index that combines the LOS and non-LOS conditions. We then modify the widespread IEEE 802.15.4a pathloss model into a unified pure statistical pathloss model that is a function of the room size and the room-density index. This pure statistical model supplements the conventional pathloss model and can help cognitive users infer pathloss information of the non-cognitive without knowing the latter’s link distance.	channel (communications);institute of electronics, information and communication engineers;line-of-sight (missile);link distance;statistical model	Rumin Yang;Bin Shen;Kyung Sup Kwak	2010	IEICE Electronic Express	10.1587/elex.7.527	econometrics;telecommunications;statistics	DB	28.214218835017412	78.85301164207938	44509

A time-efficient iteration-based Binary Search Beamforming (BSB) protocol was introduced as a replacement for the BF clauses in the standards. In this paper, we propose an improved method, Enhanced BSB (EBSB), to support NLOS environments in which BSB doesn't work efficiently. We also define a new """"single-side approach"""" to remove the local maxima from which earlier solution methods suffer. Our proposed method aims to select the best beam pair in fewer steps using an iteration-based algorithm which reduces the BF setup time. We provide performance comparison of exhaustive search, BSB and EBSB in terms of step analysis, success probability, BF setup time and power loss performances. In NLOS case, for smaller than 100 sectors at both devices' antennas, EBSB reaches higher than 0.9 probability of successfully pairing the best beams. On the other hand, training time reduces to around %34 for 330 sectors at both antennas. For the cases when EBSB fails, power loss analysis shows that the average gain loss is less than 1 dB."""	back-side bus;beamforming;binary search algorithm;brainfuck;brute-force search;flip-flop (electronics);iteration;maxima and minima;performance;simulation	Yavuz Yaman;Predrag Spasojevic	2017	2017 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2017.7925939	real-time computing;telecommunications;artificial intelligence	Vision	44.46530386691203	86.13966507666501	44511

In particular, we relate watermark detection to the problem of signal detection in the presence of (structured) noise. The paper builds on the mathematical results from several previously published papers (by our own research group or by others) to verify and support our discussion. In an attempt to unify the theoretical analysis of watermarking schemes, we propose several extensions which clarify the interrelations between the various schemes. New results include the matched filter with whitening, where we consider the effect of the image and watermark spectra and imperfect setting of filter coefficients. The paper reflects our practical experience in developing watermarking systems for DVD copy protection and broadcast monitoring. The aim of this paper is to further develop the insight in the performance of watermark detectors, to discuss appropriate models for their analysis and to provide an intuitive rationale for making design choices for a watermark detector.	coefficient;compiler;copy protection;decorrelation;design rationale;detection theory;digital watermarking;experiment;matched filter;sensor;statistical model;watermark (data file);whitening transformation	Jean-Paul M.

464ed6003cfbc8542c750b0a1fefc2b0d42bb862	minimizing age of correlated information for wireless camera networks		Freshness of information is of critical importance for a variety of applications based on wireless camera networks where multi-view image processing is required. In this study, we propose to jointly optimize the use of communication and computing resources such that information from multiple views is delivered is obtained in a timely fashion. To this end, we extend the concept of age of information to capture packets carrying correlated data. We consider the joint optimization of processing node assignment and camera transmission policy, so as to minimize the maximum peak age of information from all sources. We formulate the multi-view age minimization problem (MVAM) and prove that it is NP-hard. We provide fundamental results including tractable cases and optimality conditions. To solve the MVAM efficiently, we develop a modular optimization algorithm following a decomposition approach. Numerical results show that, by employing our approach, the maximum peak age is significantly reduced in comparison to a traditional centralized solution with minimum-time scheduling.	algorithm;centralized computing;cobham's thesis;fog computing;image processing;mathematical optimization;np-hardness;numerical analysis;numerical method;replay attack;scheduling (computing);time complexity	Qing He;György Dán;Viktoria Fodor	2018	IEEE INFOCOM 2018 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)	10.1109/INFCOMW.2018.8406914	communications system;image processing;signal-to-noise ratio;information age;real-time computing;scheduling (computing);wireless;modular design;network packet;computer science	Vision	32.806642508794546	88.14494353675819	44594

When FD users and half-duplex (HD) users access to the base station simultaneously, however, the rate region is still unknown. In this paper, we investigate hybrid NOMA (H-NOMA) systems, where a multi-antenna FD base station serves both a FD user and a HD uplink user over the same frequency band. The base station adopts successive interference cancellation (SIC) to decode the uplink signals, while the FD user is capable of adopting SIC to decode and cancel the inter-user interference. Given fixed transmission power, the achievable rate region of the H-NOMA system is the convex hull of the union of the rate regions of two alternative schemes with and without SIC at the FD user. Specifically, we derive the explicit expression of the rate region and demonstrate the potential of the proposed switching methods via numerical results.	bell laboratories layered space-time;convex hull;duplex (telecommunications);frequency band;interference (communication);numerical analysis;simplified instructional computer;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link	Zhiyuan Lin;Wei Chen	2017	2017 IEEE 86th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2017.8287897	duplex (telecommunications);single antenna interference cancellation;computer science;frequency band;telecommunications link;high-definition video;electronic engineering;interference (wave propagation);base station;spectral efficiency	Mobile	38.17874426581875	85.12885501910176	44602

In the scheme, each MS (mobile station) in the outer region receives data related to the home cell from the home BS (base station) as well as a coded version of data related to a neighboring BS from a relay node located in the cell boundary via the use of network coding. Thus, MSs can achieve more reliable macro diversity with the assistance of the relay-based handover technique. In a simulation, it is demonstrated that this technique is very effective in maintaining QoS (quality of service) in terms of outage probability over a multi-cell environment	downtime;linear network coding;quality of service;relay;simulation	Sungho Jeon	2007	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2007.061340	quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;statistics;soft handover;computer network	Mobile	29.514564340008253	86.73919763507348	44657

However, at the receiver side, the computation of Euclidean distances requires prohibitive computational complexity particularly when combined with a high-order constellation. Conventionally, it is necessary to calculate all the Euclidean distances to find the maximum likelihood solution. In this letter, we propose a novel approach based on the principle of conditioned detection combined with lattice-reduction techniques to estimate the closest point to the received symbol without the computation of all the Euclidean distances. Thanks to this approach, a reduction up to 95% of the required number of multiplications is achieved without any degradation in terms of performance by comparison with a conventional BP technique.	computation;computational complexity theory;elegant degradation;euclidean distance;lattice reduction;mimo;multipath propagation;software propagation;throughput	Ali Haroun;Charbel Abdel Nour;Matthieu Arzel;Christophe Jégo	2016	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2525722	detector;telecommunications;theoretical computer science;lattice;euclidean distance;mathematics;silicon;statistics;mimo	Vision	46.50380319207939	74.58663839912784	44697

In this paper, we propose a method that allows to decide whether a pair of unlicensed users can communicate over a licensed spectrum without causing harmful interference at the primary receiver. The proposed solution is fully distributed and is based on opportunistic information acquired via simple CTS/RTS messages exchanged in the system. We show that the solution can be applied when both primary and secondary users are equipped with multiple-antennas. In this way on one side we achieve the coexistence, when possible, of the two kind of users and on the other side, for both of them, we are able to exploit the MIMO paradigm and increase the transmission performance. A result of the proposed scheme is that the access of the secondary nodes, when feasible, is done with transmission powers that are suitably dimensioned in order to not deteriorate the primary users Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise-Ratio (SINR). To show this we provide a mapping of the areas in the transmission space that are most likely to produce high levels of interference at the primary receiver. From these maps the effects of the interference management and the advantages of the spatial diversity can be appreciated.	carpal tunnel syndrome;coexist (image);cognitive radio;cooperative mimo;interference (communication);map;programming paradigm;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio	Mauro Biagi;Francesca Cuomo	2012	2012 IEEE Globecom Workshops	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2012.6477700	opportunism;cognitive radio;cognition;telecommunications;power control;computer science;signal processing;radio receiver;statistics;computer network;mimo	Mobile	34.55111769767348	84.90588213348884	44723

We first perform initial carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation and compensation during the preamble period, and then conduct the estimation and compensation of the residual CFO and sampling frequency offset (SFO) during the payload period. The proposed design scheme reduces the logic gate count of the frequency offset compensation block by about 10%, while it gives almost the same performance at the packet error rate (PER) of 10-4 in the CM1 channel. The frequency offset estimation and compensation block is implemented using 90nm CMOS technology and tested.	frequency offset;modem;ultra-wideband	Do-Hoon Kim;Kyu-Min Kang;Chungyong Lee	2012	IEICE Transactions		real-time computing;telecommunications;rotor;computer science;frequency offset;ultra-wideband	Vision	51.823525793849804	77.97507410841395	44761
31927c57c0f8b84d1f731ab646fbf7f65779edf3	a vector coding scheme with improved spectral efficiency for ofdm with frequency error		This study proposes a subspace-based inter-carrier interference (ICI) cancellation scheme for orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Conventional ICI cancellation methods suffer from the loss of spectral efficiency, and cannot handle the ICI incurred by a large frequency error. To improve the spectral efficiency, the proposed approach uses a subspace-based precoder that maps at most   L−1     L  −  1        data symbols to a group of  L  consecutive subcarriers. At the receiver, the proposed approach first coarsely estimate the frequency bias through a set of nulling filters each defined on a dedicated spectral bin. Then, based on the estimate of the frequency bias, the proposed approach uses subcarrier-combiners to eliminate intra-group interference. Computer simulations show that in addition to achieving a high spectral efficiency proportional to the precoder order, the proposed approach can effectively eliminate the ICI caused by a large-frequency-error.	spectral efficiency	Shih-Jen Yang;Yung-Yi Wang;Wei-Wei Chen	2016	J.

Particularly, our physical layer security scheme takes the advantage of CDD formed frequency selective channel and addresses uneven comb pilots to confuse unauthorized receivers and benefit authorized receivers. Numerical results justify that, with our design, the CDD paradigm can efficiently safeguard OFDM system, and the performance can be further optimized by fine tuning channel estimation for authorized users.	algorithm;authorization;cdd;channel state information;covert channel;cryptography;encryption;interpolation;mimo;multiplexing;programming paradigm	Songlin Sun;Bo Rong;Yanhong Ju	2013	2013 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2013.6831154	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;mimo-ofdm;telecommunications;interpolation;computer science;information security;physical layer;wireless;computer network	EDA	36.356905287428106	84.00315965957927	44822

Some algorithms exploit the channel time-domain correlation by using Kalman filters (KFs) to track the channel multi-path complex amplitudes (CAs), assuming a primary acquisition of the delays. Recently, it was shown that less complex algorithms, based on a second-order Complex Amplitude Tracking Loop (CATL) structure and a Least-Square (LS) pilot-aided error signal, can also reach near optimal asymptotic mean-squared error (MSE) performance. The LS-CATL-based algorithms are inspired by digital Phase-Locked Loops (PLL), as well as by the “prediction-correction” principle of the KF (in steady-state mode). This paper sums up and extends our previous results for the tuning and steady-state performance of the LS-CATL algorithm: analytic formulae are given for the first-, second-, and third-order loops, usable here for the multi-path multi-carrier scenario, and adaptable to any Doppler spectrum model of wide-sense stationary channels.	algorithm;black–scholes model;channel state information;frequency divider;kalman filter;least squares;mean squared error;multiplexing;phase-locked loop;phasor;stationary process;steady state	Huaqiang Shu;Laurent Ros;Eric Pierre Simon	2014	2014 6th International Symposium on Communications, Control and Signal Processing (ISCCSP)	10.1109/ISCCSP.2014.6877883	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;control theory	Arch	50.44379885923383	77.33246582662656	44835

However, it also has a higher complexity owing to the computation of the eigenvectors. We propose a low-complexity Lanczos principal component (LPC) algorithm that utilizes Lanczos iterative method to compute the eigenvectors. In comparison with the PC algorithm, the proposed LPC algorithm offers significant reduction in complexity while giving a similar detection performance. Low-complexity LPC algorithm allows for the use of larger sized covariance matrix that further improves the detection performance. Maximum-minimum eigenvalue (MME) algorithm is also included in the comparison and it gives an inferior performance as compared to both PC and LPC algorithm.

A combination of space-time-frequency (STF) coding and hopping multiband OFDM modulation is also proposed to fully exploit all of the available spatial and frequency diversities, richly inherent in UWB environments. We quantify the performance merits of multiband UWB-MIMO systems in case of Nakagami-m frequency-selective fading channels. We show that the maximum achievable diversity of the proposed system is the product of the number of transmit and receive antennas, the number of multipath components, and the number of jointly encoded OFDM blocks. Interestingly, theoretical result shows that the diversity gain does not severely depend on the fading parameter m.. Finally, simulation results are presented to support the theoretical analysis.	frequency-hopping spread spectrum;half-band filter;mimo;mimo-ofdm;modulation;multipath propagation;rayleigh fading;simulation;ultra-wideband;x.690	W.

27c214ac703ef0956f273347cc984a981cba7c2b	mobile energy harvesting nodes: offline and online optimal policies		We consider a mobile energy harvesting transmitter where movement is motivated by trying to find better energy harvesting locations. Movement comes with an energy cost expenditure, and hence there exists a throughput-movement tradeoff. On one hand, the transmitter may opt not to move and use all its available energy for transmission; on the other hand, it can choose to move to a potentially better location, spending some of its available energy during the movement process, and yet harvest larger amounts of energy at the new location and achieve higher throughput. In this paper, we characterize this tradeoff by designing throughput optimal power allocation policies subject to energy causality constraints and moving costs. In our setup, the transmitter moves along a straight line, where two energy sources are located at the opposite ends of the line. We first study the offline version of this problem where the goal is to maximize the throughput by a given deadline. We find a closed form solution for the case of single energy arrival at each source, and provide an iterative solution for the case of multiple energy arrivals. Then, we study the online version of this problem with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) energy arrivals at each source, and the goal is to maximize the long term average throughput. We propose an optimal move-then-transmit scheme where the transmitter first moves towards the source with higher mean energy arrival, stays at that source, and then starts transmission.	causality;iterative method;online and offline;throughput;transmitter	Ahmed Arafa;Sennur Ulukus	2018	IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking	10.1109/TGCN.2017.2777668	line (geometry);throughput;energy harvesting;real-time computing;available energy;transmitter;mobile telephony;independent and identically distributed random variables;transmission (mechanics);computer science	Metrics	32.633226189482116	85.68501992639618	44912

The demodulation can achieve BER performance comparable to DBPSK while the bandwidth efficiency and power efficiency are higher thanks to GMSK. By combining with spread spectrum and differential demodulation, the scheme is robust at low SINR and high moving speed without accurate carrier frequency recovery. It can be further enhanced by differential space-time modulation (DSTM) giving transmit diversity which further improves robustness.

Existing ICI countermeasures usually address a few dominant ICI terms only and treat the residual similar to white noise. We show that the residual ICI has high normalized autocorrelation and that this normalized autocorrelation is insensitive to the multipath channel profile as well as a variety of other system and channel conditions. Consequently, the residual ICI plus noise can be whitened in a nearly channel-independent manner, leading to significantly improved detection performance.

It is assumed that the relay knows the channel covariance information (CCI) of the relay-destination link and the full channel state information (CSI) of the source-relay link. We start by assuming the precoder has a specified structure. We derive an upper-bound of the mean-square error (MSE) and obtain a closed form solution to minimize the upper-bound of the MSE. Although the proposed scheme is suboptimal, simulation results show that the proposed scheme has better performance in terms of the MSE and the bit error rate (BER) than the conventional schemes.	bit error rate;channel state information;mimo;mean squared error;relay;simulation;x.690	Dae-Hyun Kim;Hyung-Myung Kim	2010	21st Annual IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2010.5671893	minimum mean square error;closed-form expression;bit error rate;telecommunications;control theory;feedback;mathematics;mean squared error;neodymium;channel state information;upper and lower bounds;precoding;wireless;statistics;symmetric matrix;mimo	Embedded	39.30482950695426	83.9729699699154	45083

Inspired by the utility of studying long block-lengths in information theory, we formulate a vector version of the counterexample. Information-theoretic arguments are then used to derive bounds on the minimum cost for the vector problem. Restricted to the scalar case, the lower bounds are a strict improvement over Witsenhausen's lower bound for some parameter values. The upper bounds are based on two strategies that can asymptotically outperform optimal linear and nonlinear scalar strategies. To investigate the computational aspects of such problems, we then consider a simpler problem of lossless source coding. From a distributed control perspective, the computations required for encoding and decoding can be viewed as internal communication between virtually distributed agents. We derive new lower bounds that establish a tradeoff between the computation, communication and distortion costs for lossless source coding.	computation;data compression;distortion;distributed control system;information theory;lossless compression;nonlinear system;vector graphics;witsenhausen's counterexample	Pulkit Grover;Anant Sahai	2008	2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2008.4739477	mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;witsenhausen's counterexample;vector space;information theory;theoretical computer science;mathematics;statistics	Theory	36.590011762129926	65.35546267970608	45097

In the receiver, an adaptive equalizer using nonlinear Kalman filters with delay is coupled with a soft-in soft-cut (SISO) decoder to perform the reception process iteratively. The proposed adaptive equalizer jointly optimizes the estimates for channel taps and data symbols in each iteration with the assistance of a priori information for the data symbols supplied by the SISO decoder. In this way, the correlation between the estimates of data symbols and channel taps is taken into account in the equalization process. This correlation is usually ignored in many other turbo equalizers with separated channel estimation and data equalization. The complexity of the proposed equalizer does not grow exponentially with the modulation constellation size, and is usually lower than that of many maximum a posteriori equalizers with joint channel estimation and data detection. Performance comparison with different types of turbo equalizers over different channel conditions by Monte Carlo simulations demonstrates the advantage of the proposed turbo equalizer for fast time-varying fading channels	adaptive equalizer;algorithm;channel state information;cut (logic programming);equalization (communications);extended kalman filter;iteration;kalman filter;modulation;monte carlo method;nonlinear system;recursive least squares filter;simulation;soft-in soft-out decoder;turbo equalizer	Xin Li;Tan F.

5464d7960e1d6ada934f21029ef677fe2c0254df	efficient quantum communication under collective noise		We introduce a new quantum communication protocol for the transmission of quantum information under collective noise. Our protocol utilizes a decoherence-free subspace in such a way that an optimal asymptotic transmission rate is achieved, while at the same time encoding and decoding operations can be efficiently implemented. The encoding and decoding circuit requires a number of elementary gates that scale linearly with the number of transmitted qudits, m. The logical depth of our encoding and decoding operations is constant and depends only on the channel in question. For channels described by an arbitrary discrete group G, i.e. with a discrete number, |G|, of possible noise operators, perfect transmission at a rate m/(m+r) is achieved with an overhead that scales at most as O(dr) where the number of auxiliary qudits, r, depends solely on the group in question. Moreover, this overhead is independent of the number of transmitted qudits, m. For certain groups, e.g. cyclic groups, we find that the overhead scales only linearly with the number of group elements |G|.	quantum channel;quantum information science	Michael Skotiniotis;Wolfgang Dür;Barbara Kraus	2013	Quantum Information & Computation		quantum network;quantum noise;condensed matter physics;quantum mechanics	Theory	30.808878568527938	64.83580232328582	45131

In contrast to previous work, which focused on two antennas at the relay to achieve the optimal 4/3 DoF, we focus on the case of a single antenna half duplex relay. We show that with a single antenna relay and delayed output feedback, the upper bound of 4/3 DoF for the X-channel is achievable and we propose the achievability scheme. Moreover, we study the alternating CSIT availability distribution for the SISO X-channel and provide few remarks on the achievability of the optimal DoF.	block cipher mode of operation;channel state information;duplex (telecommunications);internet relay chat;soft-in soft-out decoder;transmitter	Duaa Abumaali;Ahmed Badawy;Tamer Khattab	2018	2018 14th International Wireless Communications & Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2018.8450455	channel state information;duplex (telecommunications);computer network;upper and lower bounds;relay;interference (wave propagation);communication channel;topology;computer science	Vision	35.94921079686124	73.15922431056572	45192

In the previous work, a blind single antenna interference cancellation (SAIC) algorithm named least mean square-blind joint maximum likelihood sequence estimation (LMS-BJMLSE) has been proposed. The proposed LMS-BJMLSE algorithm is blind with respect to interfering signals and neither the training sequence (TS) nor pilot signal from interferers is needed. However, the conventional LMS-BJMLSE requires a long training sequence (TS) for channel estimation. In this paper, we propose a TS reduction scheme in which the subcarriers are divided into small groups based on the coherence bandwidth, and the slowest converging subcarrier in each group is identified by exploiting the correlation between the mean-square error (MSE) produced by LMS and the mean-square deviation (MSD) of the desired signal. The identified subcarrier's channel estimate is replaced by the interpolation result using the adjacent subcarriers' channel estimates. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm could reduce the required TS length by 80%.	algorithm;bit error rate;channel state information;frequency divider;interference (communication);interpolation;least mean squares filter;mimo-ofdm;maximum likelihood sequence estimation;mean squared error;multiplexing;performance;simulation;subcarrier;x.690	Zhenyu Zhou;Takuro Sato	2010	21st Annual IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2010.5671866	orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;statistics	Mobile	48.74910834773556	78.25184758245022	45196

The wireless channel is, however, known to be inherently non-stationary. We detail a methodology for non-stationarity analysis from an algorithmic perspective. For the determination of local quasi-stationarity regions, we consider a multi-link downlink scenario where multiple base stations use transmit beamforming to concurrently transmit to a single mobile terminal per time slot. We obtain an algorithm-specific measure, i.e., the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) degradation, with which we evaluate local quasi-stationarity regions. Furthermore, we relate and compare the SINR degradation to the correlation matrix distance (CMD). In an urban macrocell scenario relevant to 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE), we find that the resulting local quasi-stationarity distances show the same trends, but that the CMD overestimates the average distances for our system model.	algorithm;beamforming;compaq lte;creative micro designs;data degradation;elegant degradation;interference (communication);level of detail;mobile phone;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;stationary process;telecommunications link	Adrian Ispas;Gerd Ascheid;Christian Schneider;Reiner S.

A robust multistage scheme that works in the time domain, independent of the preamble structure, is proposed. After coarse-timing estimation, joint timing and integer frequency synchronization is performed. Then, fractional frequency correction is carried out, and finally, fine-timing estimation completes the synchronization process. The new timing estimation method is flexible and can be adjusted according to the degree of channel distortion. Furthermore, frequency synchronization is efficiently accomplished with an estimation range that is as large as the bandwidth of the OFDM signal. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated in terms of the mean square error. The results indicate that the new method significantly improves performance compared with the previous methods.	additive white gaussian noise;distortion;frequency offset;mean squared error;multipath propagation;multiplexing;multistage interconnection networks;synchronization (computer science)	Hamed Abdzadeh-Ziabari;Mahrokh G.

60c30e8d7280b421e0e9a5dfa2b500e28684b3df	modulation-specific multiuser transmit precoding and user selection for one-dimensional signaling		Massive deployment of low data rate Internet of things and eHealth devices that require high reliability motivates the development of practical precoding and user selection techniques. In this paper, we show that throughput and communications reliability can be improved by incorporating knowledge of modulation type in the design of the multiuser transmit precoder. The transmission of low data rate one-dimensionally modulated signals in a broadcast channel is considered. The transmit precoding matrix is determined by minimizing the weighted sum of error probabilities of users. Although the proposed minimum probability of error (MPE) precoding problem is nonconvex and highly nonlinear, it is solved by the alternating minimization of two convex subproblems. A reduced-complexity version of convex MPE precoding is then introduced, which exponentially reduces the complexity of the problem. Numerical results show that the proposed precoding techniques significantly improve system performance in broadcast channels. A user selection algorithm, compatible with MPE precoding, is also proposed that selects users if their error probabilities can approach zero. Based on line packing principles in Grassmannian manifolds, it is shown that the number of selected users could potentially be more than the number of transmit antennas, which translates to supporting more simultaneous users in the shared channel compared to existing user selection methods.	data rate units;hp multi-programming executive;internet of things;modulation;multi-user;multiuser dos;nonlinear system;selection algorithm;set packing;software deployment;throughput;weight function	Majid Bavand;Steven D.

In this paper, the bank of matched filters is replaced by a bank of adaptive minimum mean squared error (MMSE) filters as the generator of sufficient statistics. This formal replacement of the MF bank by the adaptive MMSE filter bank has significant conceptual consequences and provides improvement by several performance measures. The adaptive MMSE-ML receiver's digital implementation is significantly computationally simplified. The advantages of the proposed adaptive MMSE-ML receiver over the MF-ML receiver are: (1) ability to perform joint synchronization, channel parameter estimation, and signal detection where the signal is sent over an unknown, slowly time-varying, frequency-selective multipath fading channel; (2) increased information capacity in a multicellular environment; and (3) significantly improved bit error rate (BER) performance in a multicellular mobile communications environment. The information capacity and the BER of the proposed MMSE-ML receiver are analyzed. Numerical results showing the BER performance of the MMSE-ML receiver in a multipath channel environment are presented.		Predrag B. Rapajic;Deva K.

If the QAM signal is power constrained and a given symbol error rate is required, we show that it is possible to maximize the bit rate of this system by optimizing the symbol rate and the number of bits/symbol. Ideal linear equalization is assumed at the receiver to overcome the distortion introduced by the channel. As an example, a Gaussian channel is chosen, and the bit rate is maximized for this channel. The QAM maximization is especially useful for channels with slowly decaying channel attenuation characteristics, e.g., the twisted-pair channel.		Irving Kalet	1987	IEEE Trans.

The main results show the MAI effects and PMD constraint at the outage probability. The contribution of these sources of interference is analysed to choose the better design of code parameters in order to increase the performance of networks based on optical code paths. These results could be applied to determine the parameters design in code/wavelength routed networks.	downtime;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);pmd;polarization (waves);polarization mode dispersion;routing	Fabio Renan Durand;Lídia Galdino;Luiz H.

Moreover, the two transmitters are assumed to be powered by a shared energy harvester, and a deterministic energy-harvesting (EH) model is adopted by assuming that the energy arrival times and the corresponding harvested amounts are non-causally known prior to transmissions. We formulate a continuous-time power allocation problem to characterize the maximum departure region over a finite time horizon. By exploiting its convexity, this problem is simplified as a discrete-time problem and the optimal solution is obtained. In particular, it is shown that there exists a certain maximum possible transmission rate (the capping rate) at one of the transmitters. Finally, we compare the performance of the optimal offline algorithm against that of the online one.	bioinformatic harvester;convex function;exponential hierarchy;frequency capping;online algorithm;online and offline;transmitter	Dan Zhao;Chuan Huang;Yue Chen;Shuguang Cui	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2013.6638571	real-time computing;telecommunications;gaussian process;mathematics;statistics;computer network	Robotics	32.75629964660659	85.72120248010484	45430

Different from all the others, in this paper, we study the performance of rate distortion function R(D) of CS with a distortion D and give a clear relationship between rate and distortion. Besides, we specify both uniform and non-uniform quantization for CS, and get the corresponding rate distortion functions in these two cases. Then, we compare their performance and analyze the results. In addition, we get the rate distortion function R(D) in the case of combining channel coding with CS, as channel coding process can make our final recovery of the original signal more accurate.	channel capacity;compressed sensing;distortion;forward error correction;profiling (computer programming);quantization (signal processing);rate–distortion theory;uncompressed video	Junjie Chen;Qilian Liang	2011	2011 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference - GLOBECOM 2011	10.1109/GLOCOM.2011.6134482	attenuation distortion;amplitude distortion;speech recognition;sinadr;distortion;rate–distortion theory;quantization;channel code;telecommunications;computer science;noise;phase distortion;compressed sensing	Vision	39.87753374687769	68.31997760128888	45499

The new scheme specifically takes into account the channel as well as information asymmetry in the broadcast phase of two-way relaying. It is based upon both bitwise XOR and symbol-level superposition coding. We first derive its achievable rate regions when integrated with two known time control protocols over Gaussian channels. We then demonstrate its average maximum sum-rate and service delay performance over fading channels. Compared with the existing bitwise XOR and symbol-level superposition coding, the proposed superimposed XOR scheme achieves larger rate region in asymmetric channels. As a result, it performs much better in terms of averaged maximum sum-rate and service delay over fading channels. Numerical results also show that the proposed practical PLNC closely approaches the capacity bound given by the informationtheoretic random binning.	ampersand;bitwise operation;exclusive or;linear network coding;product binning;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;symbol level	Jianquan Liu;Meixia Tao;Youyun Xu;Xiaodong Wang	2009	GLOBECOM 2009 - 2009 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5426240	telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;fading;statistics	Mobile	34.3897509131869	75.5687617814664	45501

Due to the distributed nature of the system, the transmitted signals are typically subject to different average path losses. For fixed distances between the mobile stations and the base station, the error performance of the distributed space-time coding scheme is determined analytically. Then, based on considerations concerning the spatial distribution of the mobile stations, analytical expressions for the distribution of the average path losses are derived and verified by means of simulations. These results are then used in order to compute the expected error performance of the system. It is shown that in most scenarios the average performance loss compared to a conventional multiple-antenna system with colocated antennas is less than 2 dB at a bit error rate of 10/sup -3/. The most significant performance losses occur for a large path-loss exponent.	best, worst and average case;bit error rate;code;colocation centre;decibel;relay;simulation;telecommunications link;transmitter;x.690	Jan Mietzner;Ragnar Thobaben;Peter Adam Hoeher	2004	IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference, 2004.

It applies to three-node networks, where a relay node establishes a bidirectional communication between two other nodes. In the first phase of a decode-and-forward protocol, the two nodes transmit their messages to a relay node, which decodes them. In the succeeding bidirectional broadcast phase, the relay broadcasts a re-encoded composition of them so that both nodes can decode the other's message using their own message as side information. We assume that the transmission is affected by unknown varying channels. Unfortunately, the unknown variation of the channel can lead to channels which completely prohibit any reliable communication. In this work, we analyze the bidirectional broadcast phase under list decoding and show that this decoding technique can improve the performance significantly in the sense that it allows to transmit reliably in scenarios where usual decoding schemes fail.	broadcast domain;hoc (programming language);list decoding;relay;semantic network;sensor;two-phase commit protocol	Rafael F.

By making use of these expressions, the mean block error probability is derived as a function of the number of total interfering users in each group.	interference (communication);network packet;rayleigh fading;telecommunications link	Jordi Pérez-Romero;Luis G.

Thanks to joint decoding and precoding, all transmitted signal power is useful, rather than “interference”. The system has the potential to support constant rates as the number of clients increases, thus offering a tremendous bandwidth boost. Despite the high gains and potential applicability to real world setups like enterprise networks, this approach is regarded today mostly as a theoretical solution because of some serious implementation difficulties. Motivated by our recent success in addressing synchronization issues in a real distributed multiuser MIMO testbed that we have developed, in this work we move one step further and design an efficient MAC scheme for such a system. First, we study and design optimal as well as practical user selection and scheduling schemes. Second, we investigate coding methods to realize the achievable rates at higher layers, and pay particular attention to recent rateless codes advancements. Last, we propose a specific MAC super-frame, and discuss how to make our system backward compatible with 802.11ac.	backward compatibility;interference (communication);mimo-ofdm;message authentication code;multi-user mimo;scheduling (computing);testbed;wireless access point	Antonios Michaloliakos;Ryan Rogalin;Horia Vlad Balan;Konstantinos Psounis;Giuseppe Caire	2013	2013 10th Annual Conference on Wireless On-demand Network Systems and Services (WONS)	10.1109/WONS.2013.6578321	synchronization;3g mimo;real-time computing;multi-user mimo;computer science;operating system;zero-forcing precoding;scheduling;precoding;computer network	Mobile	30.04293588147089	87.41088912025216	45685

However, memory effects of HPAs can no longer be ignored when communication systems have wider bandwidth. Memoryless predistortion techniques proposed previously seldom have satisfactory effectiveness for typical wideband applications such as OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) systems. In this paper, an improved adaptive predistortion method called 2D LUT (2-dimension look-up table) with different accuracy levels is presented to linearize HPAs with memory effects. Simulation and experimental results show that 2D LUT implements excellent performance in mitigating the signal deterioration caused by memory effects, both rectifies the signal constellation distortion and suppresses the spectrum emission. Large scale matrix computation is also avoidable in these adaptive algorithms, which makes them feasible when a real-time system is necessary.	lookup table	Zhiyong He;Jianhua Ge;Shujian Geng;Gang Wang	2006	TBC	10.1109/TBC.2005.861608	electronic engineering;real-time operating system;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;nonlinear system;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;adaptive system	EDA	52.2421661285231	72.56951775878359	45739

The major limiting factors of the capacity are the propagation phenomena (rain attenuation for frequencies above 10GHz) and intercell interference. Several power control schemes have been proposed to mitigate these factors and decrease the outage time. In this Letter we propose a new Climate-Driven Fuzzy Inference System for downlink power control with engineering inputs such as the rain induced attenuation on the wanted and the interfering links, the deterministic path loss and the clear-sky carrier-to-interference ratio. The proposed FIS scheme has different parameters based on the statistics of rain rate and is more energy efficient. Numerical calculations highlight the superiority of the proposed downlink power control compared to existing schemes.	downtime;inference engine;interference (communication);numerical analysis;rain fade;serial ata;software propagation;telecommunications link	Dimitris E.

Thus far, most researches on the cooperative transmission have been studied from the reliability point of view focusing on a single transmission and showing that the cooperative transmission can increase transmission reliability. In this paper, we study the effects of the cooperative transmission from the system throughput and fairness point of view, considering the following fundamental questions: Is the cooperative transmission always helpful to increase the system throughput and improve the degree of fairness among nodes? If not, when is it helpful to increase the system throughput and improve the degree of fairness among nodes? We provide the answers to the above questions with a simple system in which two source nodes are capable of being cooperative with each other by using the decode-and-forward cooperative scheme to transmit their data to a single destination node.	cooperative mimo;fairness measure;maximal set;node (computer science);performance;point of view (computer hardware company);shortest path problem;signal-to-noise ratio;throughput	Sungyeon Kim;Jang-Won Lee	2012	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2012.121008	fairness measure;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;maximum throughput scheduling;cooperative diversity;computer network	Mobile	33.10136386689667	82.29128627646823	45812

The performance of spatial multiplexing is highly dependent on channel statistics which in turn depend on antenna spacing and richness of scattering. It has been shown in [10] that the presence of transmit correlation can have a detrimental effect on the performance of multi-antenna signaling techniques. In this paper, we present a novel scheme to (partly) mitigate the performance loss of spatial multiplexing in the presence of highly correlated fading at the transmitter. The adaption to be performed at the transmitter is a form of power allocation and/or relative phase adjustment between the different symbol streams to be multiplexed. We consider the cases of dual-polarized as well as uni-polarized antennas and derive estimates of the uncoded average symbol error rate as a function of channel statistics, power allocation and phase adjustment. We then optimize power allocation and phase adjustment and demonstrate that this form of preprocessing can yield SNR gains of up to 4 dB over the case where no precoding is employed.	decibel;mimo;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;preprocessor;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spatial multiplexing;transmitter;uncompressed video	Rohit U.

In hard fusion schemes, each secondary user makes a hard decision on spectrum occupancy and a fusion center makes a final decision by combining the individual hard decisions according to a fusion rule. In soft fusion schemes, each secondary user provides a signal power measurement to the fusion center, which performs further processing on the collection of all observations to make a final decision. In this paper, we propose hard and soft fusion collaborative spectrum sensing schemes based on the online hidden bivariate Markov chain modeling of the signals received by secondary users. Compared with prior collaborative sensing schemes, the proposed model-based schemes do not rely on precomputed thresholds or weights, and achieve superior performance. The online estimation of hidden bivariate Markov models provides predictive information that can be used to improve the performance of the dynamic spectrum access. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the performance and communication overhead tradeoffs of the proposed collaborative spectrum sensing schemes.	bivariate data;cognitive radio;dual total correlation;ibm systems network architecture;markov chain;markov model;multi-user;network switch;numerical method;overhead (computing);precomputation;sensor;simulation;stochastic matrix	Yuandao Sun;Brian L.

cd0f14cc80732901353a1fed8e62add1316174ea	capacity analysis of noma with mmwave massive mimo systems		Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), millimeter wave (mmWave), and massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) have been emerging as key technologies for fifth generation mobile communications. However, less studies have been done on combining the three technologies into the converged systems. In addition, how many capacity improvements can be achieved via this combination remains unclear. In this paper, we provide an in-depth capacity analysis for the integrated NOMA-mmWave-massive-MIMO systems. First, a simplified mmWave channel model is introduced by extending the uniform random single-path model with angle of arrival. Afterward, we divide the capacity analysis into the low signal to noise ratio (SNR) and high-SNR regimes based on the dominant factors of signal to interference plus noise ratio. In the noise-dominated low-SNR regime, the capacity analysis is derived by the deterministic equivalent method with the Stieltjes–Shannon transform. In contrast, the statistic and eigenvalue distribution tools are invoked for the capacity analysis in the interference-dominated high-SNR regime. The exact capacity expression and the low-complexity asymptotic capacity expression are derived based on the probability distribution function of the channel eigenvalue. Finally, simulation results validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate that significant capacity improvements can be achieved by the integrated NOMA-mmWave-massive-MIMO systems.	angle of arrival;channel (communications);fifth generation computer;interference (communication);mimo;shannon (unit);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Di Zhang;Zhenyu Zhou;Chen Xu;Yan Zhang;Jonathan Rodriguez;Takuro Sato	2017	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2017.2699059	mimo;probability density function;eigenvalues and eigenvectors;computer science;converged infrastructure;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;mathematical optimization;angle of arrival;signal-to-noise ratio;communication channel	Metrics	38.632527152599344	80.03772144773174	46375

In this paper, a novel estimation method for the estimation of the received SNR of GOFDM signal that is required in the adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) is presented. The simulation results of the estimated SNR show excellent correlation with the analytical results. Furthermore, the received SNRs of the GOFDM exhibit repetition of as set values that can be clustered for modulation and coding scheme (MCS) allocation in group-based AMC. The paper also presents various performances of the proposed GOFDM with AMC and compares them with the corresponding performance of OFDM and CP-SC under same operating conditions.	advanced mezzanine card;cp/cms;modulation;performance;power architecture platform reference;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Lin Tang;Mingqi Li;Mosa Ali Abu-Rgheff;Haifeng Wang	2007	2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2007.261	real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;link adaptation;telecommunications;computer science;operant conditioning;adaptive coding;statistics	HPC	44.555280382364245	80.899567631483	46443

The proposed approach enables iterative decoding for serially concatenated arithmetic codes and convolutional codes. Iterations are performed between Soft In Soft Out (SISO) component decoders. For arithmetic decoding, we proposed to employ a low complex trellis search technique to estimate the best transmitted codewords and generate soft outputs. Performance of the presented system are evaluated in terms of PER, in the case of transmission across the AWGN channel. Simulation results show that the proposed JSC iterative scheme leads to significant gain in comparison with a traditional separated decoding. Finally, the practical relevance of the proposed technique is validated under an image transmission system using the SPIHT codec.	additive white gaussian noise;code word;codec;concatenation;convolutional code;iteration;relevance;set partitioning in hierarchical trees;simulation;soft-in soft-out decoder;trellis quantization	Amin Zribi;Sonia Zaibi;Ramesh Pyndiah;Ammar Bouallègue	2009	2009 Data Compression Conference	10.1109/DCC.2009.31	list decoding;convolutional code;real-time computing;sequential decoding;computer science;theoretical computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	42.110078873439555	64.63606774117501	46446
47cfcbc507fb04487d80ea1876c79d4ec0afa1e2	a decomposition method for mimo ota performance evaluation		Diagnosis and troubleshooting are critical to efficiently detecting the imperfections and improving the radio frequency designs for wireless systems in the research and development stage. For achieving these, this paper proposes a decomposition method for the measurement of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) devices’ over-the-air (OTA) performance. By using the proposed method, the antenna active envelope correlation coefficient, the radiated sensitivity of each receiver, the total isotropic sensitivity, the self-interference, and the desensitization can all be achieved separately, and in the OTA working mode. In consideration of the MIMO system's complex array antennas and radio frequency receivers, the parameters obtained by this decomposition method are significant for discovering the imperfections, for debugging, and for improving the design of the devices. It is a valuable tool to raise the debugging efficiency of MIMO systems.	coefficient;debugging;desensitization (telecommunications);interference (communication);mimo;performance evaluation;radio frequency;sensor;software release life cycle	Penghui Shen;Yihong Qi;Wei Yu;Jun Fan;Zhiping Yang;Songping Wu	2018	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2018.2839726	electronic engineering;decomposition method (constraint satisfaction);mimo;debugging;wireless;radio frequency;isotropy;troubleshooting;computer science;correlation coefficient	Visualization	45.19145655584475	88.11843234161627	46468

The minimum zero-error asymptotic rate of transmission is shown to be the complementary graph entropy of an associated graph. Thus, previous results in the literature provide upper and lower bounds for this minimum rate (further, these bounds are tight for the important class of perfect graphs). The algorithmic aspects of instantaneous code design are considered next. It is shown that optimal code design is -hard. An optimal code design algorithm is derived. Polynomial-time suboptimal algorithms are also presented, and their average and worst case performance guarantees are established.	algorithm;best, worst and average case;complement graph;data compression;encoder;polynomial;prefix code;time complexity	Prashant Koulgi;Ertem Tuncel;Shankar L.

Since the current low-complexity MSDD detection still have the problems such as high complexity, difficult to parallel processing and random latency etc, this study proposes a new algorithm called M-bound intersection detector (M-BID) which derived from the BID incorporated with the M algorithm. A new bounding approach and a simplified BID combining with the M algorithm are presented in M-BID to reduce the computational complexity and obtain a relative stable latency. The numerical and simulation results show that the proposed M-BID algorithm achieves an overall better performance-complexity trade-off over the M algorithm and the BID. Moreover, it possesses the advantages of parallel processing and stable latency which are facilitated for hardware implementation.	modulation	N. Jin;X. P. Jin;Y. G. Ying;S. Wang;Y. F.

Since the optimal detector is impractically complex, many suboptimal detectors have been proposed such as the linear, soft limiter and Cauchy detectors. However, no adequate explanation for the difference in performance between these detectors has been proposed. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, based on the optimal decision regions, that is used to justify the performance of many suboptimal detectors and compare them to the optimal one. Moreover, the analysis of the framework provides a novel method to significantly improve the performance of the soft limiter detector by employing an adaptive threshold that is a function of the signal level and noise dispersion. As the number of samples per symbol increases, the performance of the proposed adaptive detector approaches the optimal performance at almost no additional complexity over the conventional linear (Gaussian) detector.	interference (communication);limiter;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio	Tarik S.

The problem of determining the feasibility and stability of cooperation between rational nodes in a wireless network is of great importance in understanding cooperative behavior. This paper addresses the stability of the grand coalition of transmitters signaling over a multiple access channel using the framework of cooperative game theory. The external interference experienced by each TX is represented accurately by modeling the cooperation game between the TXs in partition form. Single user decoding and successive interference cancelling strategies are examined at the receiver. Transmitter cooperation is stable, if and only if the core of the game (the set of all divisions of grand coalition utility such that no coalition deviates) is nonempty. Determining the stability of cooperation is a co-NP-complete problem in general. For a single user decoding receiver, transmitter cooperation is shown to be stable at both high and low SNRs, while for an interference cancelling receiver with a fixed decoding order, cooperation is stable only at low SNRs and unstable at high SNR. When time sharing is allowed between decoding orders, it is shown using an approximate lower bound to the utility function that TX cooperation is also stable at high SNRs. Thus, this paper demonstrates that ideal zero cost TX cooperation over a MAC is stable and improves achievable rates for each individual user.	approximation algorithm;co-np;co-np-complete;control theory;game theory;interference (communication);mimo;mandatory access control;np-completeness;numerical analysis;signal-to-noise ratio;simplified instructional computer;time-sharing;transmitter;utility	Srinivas Yerramalli;Rahul Jain;Urbashi Mitra	2014	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2013.2290496	game theory;multi-user mimo;telecommunications;mathematics	Mobile	38.134228394010954	84.55389548917232	46670

The RN is equipped with a buffer, which is capable of storing multiple frames received from the SNs. During each time slot, the proposed protocol activates either the SN–RN hop or the RN–DN hop, depending on the channel quality of each hop and the buffer state at the RN. To optimise the hop activation for the network, they design a hop quality metric and propose a multi-user buffer-aided-relaying uplink (MU-BR-UL) protocol, with the aid of the minimum signal-to-noise power ratio approximation. The benefits of the proposed protocol are analysed in terms of the end-to-end (e2e) outage probability and the e2e transmission delay. Then, the optimal power allocation is proposed for minimising the e2e outage probability under the total power constraint. The results indicate that the outage performance is significantly improved when the proposed power allocation is utilised in the MU-BR-UL protocol.	downtime;multi-user;telecommunications link	Bo Zhang;Chen Dong;Jing Lei;Mohammed El-Hajjar;Lie-Liang Yang;Lajos Hanzo Hanzo	2016	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2015.0338	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer network	ECom	33.52501670761524	77.84706701615418	46691

This protocol chooses in each times slot one codeword to be transmitted over either the source-relay or t he relay-destination channel depending on the channel states.

e3f1617437cae4a64d10b327ddd885211871eaf4	energy harvesting communications under explicit and implicit temperature constraints		With a motivation to understand the effects of temperature sensitivity on wireless data transmission performance, we consider an energy harvesting communication system, where the temperature dynamics are governed by the transmission power policy. Different from the previous work, we consider a discrete time system where transmission power is kept constant in each slot. We consider two models that capture different effects of temperature. In the first model, the temperature is constrained to be below a critical temperature at all time instants; we coin this the explicit temperature constrained model. We investigate throughput optimal power allocation for multiple energy arrivals under general, as well as temperature and energy limited regimes. We show that the optimal power allocation for the temperature limited case is monotone decreasing. In the second model, we consider the effect of the temperature on the channel quality via its influence on additive noise power; we coin this the implicit temperature constrained model. In this model, the change in the variance of the additive noise due to previous transmissions is non-negligible. In particular, transmitted signals contribute as interference for all subsequent slots and thus affect the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR). In this case, we investigate throughput optimal power allocation under general, as well as low and high SINR regimes. We show in the low SINR regime that the optimal allocation dictates the transmitter to save its harvested energy till the last slot. In the high SINR regime, we show that the optimal power sequence is monotone increasing. Finally, we consider the case in which implicit and explicit temperature constraints are simultaneously active and we show under certain conditions that the optimal power sequence is monotone decreasing.	additive white gaussian noise;discrete system;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;noise power;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;throughput;transmitter;utility functions on indivisible goods;monotone	Abdulrahman Baknina;Omur Ozel;Sennur Ulukus	2018	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2018.2861874	communications system;throughput;real-time computing;discrete time and continuous time;noise power;mathematics;data transmission;control theory;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;interference (wave propagation);signal-to-noise ratio	Metrics	32.752192576845275	85.87966820300036	46750

The uplink of an impulse-radio ultrawideband system is considered. The effects of self-interference and multiple-access interference on the performance of generic Rake receivers are investigated for synchronous systems. Focusing on energy efficiency, a noncooperative game is proposed in which users in the network are allowed to choose their transmit powers to maximize their own utilities, and the Nash equilibrium for the proposed game is derived. It is shown that, due to the frequency selective multipath, the noncooperative solution is achieved at different signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios, depending on the channel realization and the type of Rake receiver employed. A large-system analysis is performed to derive explicit expressions for the achieved utilities. The Pareto-optimal (cooperative) solution is also discussed and compared with the noncooperative approach.	game theory;interference (communication);multipath propagation;nash equilibrium;pareto efficiency;rake;system analysis;telecommunications link;ultra-wideband	Giacomo Bacci;Marco Luise;H.

In multihop mobile networks, each node is free to move, and each link is established between two nodes. A link between two nodes is established when one node enters the transmission range of the other node, and the link is broken when either node leaves the transmission range of the other. The time interval during which the link remains active is referred to as the link duration. We develop an analytical model for link duration in multihop mobile networks. We find that the link duration for two nodes is determined by the relative speed between the two nodes and the distance during which the link is connected, which are, in turn, determined by the angles between the two nodes' velocities and the angle of one node incident to the other node's transmission range, respectively. The analytical result is then extended to model multipoint links, which appear in existing group mobility models. The accuracy of our framework is validated by simulations based on existing mobility models. The results show that our model can accurately describe the link-duration distribution for point-to-point and multi-point links in multihop mobile networks, particularly when the transmission range of each node is relatively smaller than the entire network coverage.	multipoint ground;point-to-point (telecommunications);simulation	Yueh-Ting Wu;Wanjiun Liao;Cheng-Lin Tsao;Tsungnan Lin	2009	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2008.2008190	electronic engineering;exposed node problem;star network;telecommunications;point-to-point;computer science;accuracy and precision;statistics;computer network	Mobile	25.765668683726574	76.37347640655307	46783

In particular, Arikan's polarization technique applied individually to each user polarizes any m-user binary input MAC into a finite collection of extremal MACs. The extremal MACs have a number of desirable properties: (i) the ‘uniform sum rate’1 of the original channel is not lost, (ii) the extremal MACs have rate regions that are not only polymatroids but matroids and thus (iii) their uniform sum rate can be reached by each user transmitting either uncoded or fixed bits; in this sense they are easy to communicate over. A polar code can then be constructed with an encoding and decoding complexity of O(n log n) (where n is the block length), a block error probability of o(exp(−n1/2-∊)), and capable of achieving the uniform sum rate of any binary input MAC with arbitrary many users. An application of this polar code construction to a coding scheme for the AWGN channel is also discussed.	additive white gaussian noise;block code;matroid;polar code (coding theory);polarization (waves);transmitter	Emmanuel Abbe;Emre Telatar	2010	2010 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)	10.1109/ITA.2010.5454148	combinatorics;telecommunications;theoretical computer science;probability of error;mathematics;code;error exponent;encoding;statistics	Crypto	35.902139559975716	68.45702030841365	46789

However, AFTWRC requires the knowledge of channel state information (CSI) not only for coherent data detection but also for the selfdata removal. This is partial accomplished by training sequence-based linear channel estimation. However, conventional linear estimation techniques neglect anticipated sparsity of multipath channel and thus lead to low spectral efficiency which is scarce in the field of wireless communication. Unlike the previous methods, we propose a sparse channel estimation method which can exploit the sparse structure and hence provide significant improvements in MSE performance when compared with traditional LS-based linear channel probing strategies in AF-TWRN. Simulation results confirm the proposed methods.	af-heap;anisotropic filtering;channel state information;coherence (physics);compressed sensing;data rate units;multipath propagation;radio frequency;relay;simulation;sparse matrix;spectral efficiency	Guan Gui;Qun Wan;Wei Peng;Fumiyuki Adachi	2010	CoRR		binary erasure channel;telecommunications;information theory;computer science;mathematics;channel state information;relay channel;compressed sensing;precoding;channel capacity;wireless;statistics;spectral efficiency;computer network;mimo;channel	Mobile	47.295583513473154	79.15725065270259	46814

Assuming that a number of cognitive radio relay nodes N (N ≥ 2) are co-located with simultaneous primary and secondary transmissions, the “best” relays are chosen to assist the primary and/or the secondary transmission(s) (in case of decoding failure at the destination(s) using the direct link source-destination). The outage probability of both primary and secondary systems is investigated and the associated power allocation problem analyzed. Results show that incremental relaying allows to improve greatly the secondary outage probability with respect to a primary outage probability threshold, compared to the non-cooperative case. Moreover, they suggest that selecting at first the “best” relay to assist the primary transmission before the one that would assist the secondary transmission is more beneficial than choosing at first the “best” relay that would help the secondary transmission. Finally, by proposing an adequate transmit power allocation scheme, we bypass the secondary transmissions' blocking at low primary Signal-to-Noise-Ratio.	blocking (computing);cognitive radio;downtime;inline linking;relay;simulation	Wael Jaafar;Wessam Ajib;David Haccoun	2012	2012 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2012.6503281	telecommunications;computer science;relay channel;computer network	Mobile	34.52910790635859	80.98772783364232	46851

For the Hoyt and Rice fading channels, the results presented also cover the case of coherent addition of interfering signals. Furthermore, for the Nakagami-m fading channel, the case of unequal average power levels is also studied. For the sake of comparison, results for the carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) are also presented. The formulations derived here are exact and unprecedented in the literature. Some of these formulations are given in infinite series form whereas several of them are presented in closed-form expressions.

The fading gain value is partitioned into a number of regions by which we decide the transmission power according to the region the fading gain falls in. The optimum fading gain region boundaries (switching thresholds) for maximizing spectrum efficiency (SE) under a target BER and average power constraint are derived. It is shown that the Lagrange multiplier in the constrained SE optimization will be unique if the existence condition for multi-antenna systems is satisfied, and is unique for single antenna systems. A practical iterative calculation method based on Steepest Descent Algorithm for finding the Lagrange multiplier is proposed. With the switching thresholds, the closed-form expressions of the SE and average BER, respectively for VP system and constant-power (CP) system are achieved. Simulation results for SE and average BER are in good agreement with the theory analysis. The results show that VP adaptive modulation with space-time coding provides better SE than the counterpart with CP under a target BER and average power constraint.	adaptive filter;algorithm;cp system;constrained optimization;control theory;gradient descent;iterative method;lagrange multiplier;mimo;mathematical optimization;modulation;open research;profiling (computer programming);rayleigh fading;simulation;spectral efficiency;x.690	Xiangbin Yu;Huibin Shi	2010	Science China Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-010-4060-3	gradient descent;spectrum;mathematical optimization;space–time block code;link adaptation;computer science;control theory;mathematics;lagrange multiplier;space–time code;statistics;satisfiability	HPC	39.36596562869175	82.37262094160582	47058

fc9f58d75c58d5339f318d0be22f7e4abb9bbf04	channel magnifying limited feedback technique for fdd massive mimo systems	fdd system;limited feedback;massive mimo	A limited feedback system, so-called, channel magnifying (CM) is proposed for a downlink (DL) frequency-division duplex (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. Although massive MIMO system has received significant research interest as a key technology for beyond 4G wireless communications systems, it has a number of issues that needs to be technically addressed. Among such issues is the difficulty of acquiring channel state information at transmitter for an FDD massive MIMO system which cannot exploit channel reciprocity as in a time-division duplex system. The proposed CM technique makes it possible to support a few user equipments in DL FDD massive MIMO system by finding a balance between spatial resources and channel quantization error (CQE). By choosing a subchannel with low CQE, CM can secure multiplexing gain at high SNR based on a fixed size codebook. Two types of subchannel indicator alignment (SIA) schemes are introduced for efficient interference nulling for the proposed CM technique. Specifically, we discuss how to maximize the sumrate of CM through genie added SIA and minimum CQE based SIA. Simulation results show that the sum rate of the proposed CM has a higher multiplexing gain than that of random vector quantization, especially when the number of transmit antennas is sufficiently large.	mimo	Hoondong Noh;Younsun Kim;Chungyong Lee	2016	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-016-3222-z	telecommunications;control theory	Mobile	40.657839850955725	85.65887151644314	47075

Alternatively, we propose another way to perform spectrum balancing in two steps and that makes use of joint diagonalization techniques. As an example application, we show how balancing of Prolate Spheroidal Wave Functions (PSWFs) can be used to build orthogonal families of brief impulses with flat spectra that are of potential interest for Ultra Wide Band (UWB) communications.	algorithm;approximation algorithm;bandlimiting;brute-force search;fast walsh–hadamard transform;hadamard code;hadamard transform;linear programming relaxation;multi-user;prolate spheroidal wave function;radar;signal subspace;x.690	Thierry Chonavel;Pauline Vincent	2010	10th International Conference on Information Science, Signal Processing and their Applications (ISSPA 2010)	10.1109/ISSPA.2010.5605600	code division multiple access;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics	Robotics	52.960336177401004	84.83060703905123	47105

This paper proposes a practical uplink MIMO scheme for time division duplex (TDD) systems to co-exist with BD so that the CSI of the BD channel is used also in the uplink transmission. It is shown that the precoded pilot symbols are sufficient in both uplink and downlink to satisfy the needs of both transmission and reception. The capacity of the system is analyzed in conjunction with linear receivers in a time-varying fading channel. The effect of using transmit and receive CSI estimated from noisy pilot symbols is studied. According to the results the proposed uplink transmission strategy provides capacity gain over non-precoded transmission, without being sensitive to channel time variations and CSI estimation errors.	blu-ray;channel capacity;channel state information;duplex (telecommunications);mimo-ofdm;modulation;multi-user mimo;point of view (computer hardware company);singular value decomposition;telecommunications link;test-driven development;transmitter	Petri Komulainen;Matti Latva-aho;Markku J.

The optimal user selection algorithm, which requires exhaustive search, is computationally prohibitive in real systems. In this paper, we propose a user selection algorithm with low complexity, where the product of eigenvalues of effective channels is utilized as a selection metric. We adopt the concept of principal angles between subspaces to obtain the product of eigenvalues of effective channel matrix at each iteration. Contrary to conventional low complex user selection algorithms, the proposed algorithm is straightforward to apply to PF scheduling because the proposed selection metric indicates data rate in high SNR regime. Computational complexity analysis and simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves almost the same the system throughput of capacity-based algorithm in high SNR regime with considerable reduction in complexity.	analysis of algorithms;blu-ray;brute-force search;computational complexity theory;data rate units;iteration;multi-user mimo;scheduling (computing);selection algorithm;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;telecommunications link;throughput	Seongho Nam;Jeongchan Kim;Youngnam Han	2013	2013 IEEE 78th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2013.6692056	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;average-case complexity;computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system;worst-case complexity;communication complexity;mathematics;iterative method;scheduling	EDA	38.92614758668008	87.06232756341805	47159

In the paper, we investigate the delay-optimal data transmission in the renewable energy aided CR networks. Specifically, a primary user (PU) and a secondary user (SU) share the same frequency in an area. The SU's interference to the PU is controlled by interference-signal-ratio (ISR) constraint, which means that the ISR at the PU receiver (Rx) should be less than a threshold. Under this constraint, the renewable energy powered SU aims to minimize the average data buffer delay by scheduling the renewable allocations in each slot. A constrained stochastic optimization problem is formulated when the randomness of the renewable arrival, the uncertainty of the SU's data generation, and the variability of the fading channel are taken into account. By analyzing the formulated problem, we propose two practical algorithms that is optimal for two special scenarios. And the two algorithms respectively give an upper and a lower bound for the general scenario. In addition, the availability of the PU's private information at the SU is discussed. Finally, numerical simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.	algorithm;cognitive radio;data buffer;greedy algorithm;ibm systems network architecture;information systems research;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;one-class classification;online and offline;optimization problem;personally identifiable information;randomness;run-length encoding;scheduling (computing);simulation;spatial variability;spectral efficiency;stochastic optimization;superuser	Tian Zhang;Wei Chen	2016	2016 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2016.7564848	renewable energy;telecommunications;resource management;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;energy harvesting	Mobile	33.01242159726353	85.88876709289806	47196

Previously reported adaptive modulation schemes generally select the modulation scheme based on the estimated carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR) on each subcarrier. However, in antenna array communication in addition to the CNR, the spatial fading correlation should also be considered to evaluate the system performance. Especially, when the Time Shifted Sampling (TSS) technique is applied which overcomes the spatial correlation for some subchannels of an OFDM symbol, the spatial correlation varies dramatically through subcarriers. In this work, modulation scheme is selected based on the CNR and the spatial correlation coefficient for each subcarrier when the TSS technique is employed at the receiver. Numerical results through computer simulation show that the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional systems in achieving a target BER and establishing reliable communication while having almost the same transmission rate.	adaptive grammar;algorithm;carrier-to-noise ratio;coefficient;computer simulation;frequency divider;modulation;multiplexing;numerical method;sampling (signal processing);subcarrier;x.690	Refik Çaglar Kizilirmak;Yukitoshi Sanada	2010	21st Annual IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2010.5671964	computer simulation;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics	Mobile	44.62940361480569	79.16282615030545	47321

A co-channel heterogeneous cellular network (HetNet), in which small-cell base stations (S-BSs) are placed at the hot spot area of a macro-cell base station (M-BS), has been receiving attention in order to deal with the increasing traffic. In general cellular systems, synchronization signal (SS) symbols for the cell identification at user equipments (UEs) are periodically transmitted from each base station. For HetNet, Cell Range Expansion (CRE), in which a bias value is added to the reference signal received power from S-BSs, has been investigated as a promising approach to offload the traffic into small-cells from macro-cells. However, there is an issue that the cell identification performance at small-cell area degrades with the CRE bias value, since larger CRE bias value suffers from larger interference from M-BSs at the received SS symbols transmitted from S-BSs in the small-cell area expanded by CRE. In our previous work, we proposed a performance improvement scheme on small-cell identification possible with synchronization signal power boosting (called SSPB) at S-BSs for HetNet employing CRE based on the hierarchical SS structure of LTE/LTE-Advanced systems. Unfortunately, the proposed SSPB suffers from a trade-off issue of improving the cell identification performance between macro-cell area and small-cell area. Then, this paper investigates a transmission power optimization of the SS symbols in HetNet employing CRE. The authors evaluate the cell identification performance when applying SSPB. And then, they evaluate its quality with a parameter of the power boosting value of SS symbols for various CRE bias values, and clarify that the optimal transmission power boosting value of the SS symbols at S-BSs is almost the same as the CRE bias value.	cell (microprocessor);compaq lte;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;power optimization (eda);smartphone	Manabu Mikami;Sourabh Maiti;Hitoshi Yoshino	2016	2016 IEEE 83rd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2016.7504152	embedded system;synchronization;electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;boosting	EDA	27.579822776453412	86.4287631733349	47346

Assuming the packet length is n, GSEEC requires communication overhead O(log(n)) and coding complexity O(n) to reliably estimate BER. In this paper, random walk based error-estimation-codes (RAKEE) are proposed, which are able to achieve constant communication overhead O(1) and linear coding complexity O(n).

3a352e3c1bda56c5b3d44d48ae70fce6db0b68d1	necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for classical simulations of quantum communication processes		We consider the process consisting of preparation, transmission through a quantum channel, and subsequent measurement of quantum states. The communication complexity of the channel is the minimal amount of classical communication required for classically simulating it. Recently, we reduced the computation of this quantity to a convex minimization problem with linear constraints. Every solution of the constraints provides an upper bound on the communication complexity. In this paper, we derive the dual maximization problem of the original one. The feasible points of the dual constraints, which are inequalities, give lower bounds on the communication complexity, as illustrated with an example. The optimal values of the two problems turn out to be equal (zero duality gap). By this property, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality in terms of a set of equalities and inequalities. We use these conditions and two reasonable but unproven hypotheses to derive the lower bound n2 n−1 for a noiseless quantum channel with capacity equal to n qubits. This lower bound can have interesting consequences in the context of the recent debate on the reality of the quantum state.	communication complexity;computation;convex optimization;duality gap;entropy maximization;hidden variable theory;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;quantum channel;quantum state;qubit;regular expression;simulation;time complexity	Alberto Montina;Stefan Wolf	2014	CoRR	10.1103/PhysRevA.90.012309	quantum capacity;classical capacity;quantum mechanics	Theory	34.556134050488346	65.60334840529315	47356

Different methodologies have already been proposed to calculate the so-called SFN gain over Multi Frequency Networks (MFNs), but so far, the influence of (MFN) handover mechanisms on the gain values has not yet been investigated. Also, it can be expected that in SFNs, the gain values will depend on the transmission delay difference of the signals from the different transmitters in the SFN. This paper will first assess the influence of a handover mechanism on previously obtained SFN gain values. Secondly, it will be investigated if the transmission delay difference is a good predictor for the SFN gain. This paper further clarifies the SFN concept from a network planner's point of view and aids in understanding what a network planner should take into account when deploying an SFN.	coefficient;gnu emacs;kerrison predictor;network switch;single-frequency network;transmitter	David Plets;Wout Joseph;Leen Verloock;Luc Martens;Pablo Angueira;José Antonio Arenas	2012	IEEE international Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting	10.1109/BMSB.2012.6264258	electronic engineering;geography;telecommunications;computer network	Arch	25.453159304977422	83.47192582158743	47411

The bit error rates (BER) of two QPSK bits are derived individually based on the developed system model, and they turn out to differ by more than an order of magnitude for a phase modulator based transmitter. The phenomenon, previously unreported, arises because such a transmitter introduces a controlled form of inter-symbol-interference (ISI), and the receiver low-pass filters affect this ISI differently for the two bits. The optimum bandwidth of the receiver low-pass filter is obtained from the analytic derivation, which is about 0.7 times the symbol rate. We propose two simple system modifications, one in the transmitter and one in the receiver, to compensate for the phenomenon and equalize the two BER’s. Those modifications improve the system performance by about 2 dB without adding any extra hardware.

In this paper, we formulate an accurate EE metric for cooperative two-hop systems that use the amplify-and-forward relaying scheme. Different from the existing research that assumes the availability of perfect channel state information (CSI) at the communication cooperative nodes, we assume a practical scenario, where training pilots are used to estimate the channels. The estimated CSI can be used to adapt the available resources of the proposed system in order to maximize the EE. Two estimation strategies are assumed namely disintegrated channel estimation, which assumes the availability of channel estimator at the relay, and cascaded channel estimation, where the relay is not equipped with channel estimator and only forwards the received pilot(s) in order to let the destination estimate the cooperative link. The channel estimation cost is reflected on the EE metric by including the estimation error in the signal-to-noise term and considering the energy consumption during the estimation phase. Based on the formulated EE metric, we propose an energy-aware power allocation algorithm to maximize the EE of the cooperative system with channel estimation. Furthermore, we study the impact of the estimation parameters on the optimized EE performance via simulation examples.		Osama Amin;Ebrahim Bedeer;Mohamed Hossam Ahmed;Octavia A.

CoMP operation, which improves cooperative transmission among cells and reduces or eliminates intercell interference, enables performance improvement in cell edge and average throughputs. Although leakage-based precoding has been investigated for multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, its extension to CoMP requires further analysis of the near-far effect under multicell deployment scenarios. To this end, we propose to incorporate the channel between a victim user equipment (UE) and the cell that serves the victim UE into the leakage-based precoding calculation. We investigated optimal linear scaling of the covariance matrix involving this channel. To determine the benefits of the investigated algorithm, multicell system level evaluations were carried out. This confirmed the improved performance of the system's average and cell edge throughputs.	ab initio quantum chemistry methods;algorithm;compaq lte;image scaling;interference (communication);mimo;multi-user;software deployment;spectral leakage	Masayuki Hoshino;Hui Tong;Tomohumi Takata;Yasuaki Yuda;Daichi Imamura	2012	2012 IEEE 75th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VETECS.2012.6240076	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;zero-forcing precoding;control theory;mathematics;precoding;statistics	HPC	31.56973110355274	83.99999499716695	47463

The intense proliferation of wireless devices resulted in interference limited networks, which suggests the use of interference mitigation and coordination techniques. In this work, we study successive interference cancellation (SIC) for uplink communications and we define an analytical framework that describes the performance benefits of SIC which accounts for the computational complexity of the cancellation scheme and the relevant network related parameters such as the random position and density of the base stations and mobile users, and the characteristics of the propagation channel. In our analysis, we explicitly model the consecutive events of canceling interferers and we derive expressions of the success probability to cancel the kth strongest signal and to decode the signal of interest (SoI) after k cancellations. The analysis indicates that the performance benefit of SIC diminishes quickly with k. The framework also reveals that a substantial performance gain can only be obtained for low values of the target signal-to-interference ratio (SIR).	bell laboratories layered space-time;computational complexity theory;interference (communication);linear programming relaxation;multitier architecture;numerical analysis;simplified instructional computer;software propagation;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link	Matthias Wildemeersch;Tony Q.

In the chip-based configuration, different interfering components are rejected based on the spatial distribution of their power. In the symbol-based configuration, spatial diversity is exploited after despreading and different interfering components are rejected based on their interfering strength, which depends on both their power and code correlation with the signal of interest. For the symbol-based configuration, more effort is applied to rejecting the interfering components with higher interfering strength, and thus, a more selective and efficient system is achieved. Detailed performance analysis and simulations show that in the presence of multiple-access interference, the symbol-based configuration can lead to a significant improvement in the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio relative to that achieved with the chip-based configuration for both asynchronous and synchronous DS-CDMA systems.	beamforming;gradient;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);loss function;sandy bridge;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;silicon on insulator;simulation	Nanyan Y.

It is shown that accurate estimation can be obtained when a training sequence is actually arithmetically added to the information data as opposed to being placed in a separate empty time slot - hence the words 'hidden' and 'almost blind'. A closed form solution for the channel estimation variance is derived. A procedure is given to obtain training sequences that result in channel estimation independence of both the channel characteristics and modulation format. The problems of blind synchronization and dc offset are solved.

For the Burst Rank Loss Network, instead of a single-link erasure channel, there is a channel matrix that is rank-deficient for a burst of time before returning to full-rank. We establish the streaming capacity of the Burst Rank Loss Network and construct a new family of layered codes referred to as Recovery Of Bursts In Networks (ROBIN) codes that achieve capacity. Our results generalize previous work on both the single-link and multiple-parallel-link streaming setups. Simulations over statistical network models show that ROBIN codes lose fewer packets than baseline codes.	baseline (configuration management);binary erasure channel;burst error;code;computer simulation	Rafid Mahmood;Ahmed Badr;Ashish Khisti	2016	2016 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	10.1109/ISIT.2016.7541829	concatenated error correction code;linear network coding;real-time computing;error detection and correction;online codes;burst error-correcting code;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;linear code;luby transform code;mathematics;error floor;statistics	Arch	32.23102283574317	72.13725879860341	47558

In this paper, we propose an analytical model to investigate how the station density affects the energy efficiency of relay-assisted cellular networks. With the aid of stochastic geometry theory, we derive the coverage probabilities and mean achievable rates of both cooperative users and non-cooperative users, and based on these, we further derive the analytical expression of energy efficiency and verify that by simulation. Numerical results show the significant improvement on energy efficiency brought by relays and that the energy efficiency presents a convex trend as the station density varies, which sheds key insights into the optimal densities of both base stations and relays with respect to energy efficient network deployment.	network planning and design;numerical method;relay;simulation;software deployment;thinning	Haichao Wei;Na Deng;Ming Zhao;Wuyang Zhou;Peng Dong	2012	2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)	10.1109/ICCChina.2012.6356917	stochastic process;lead;simulation;energy conservation;telecommunications;interference;signal-to-noise ratio;statistics	Mobile	28.336548012263258	85.05452397992694	47702

53bcd44aeb3b642c33f90e5520ff3949a5c6faeb	informatic analysis for hidden pulse attack exploiting spectral characteristics of optics in plug-and-play quantum key distribution system		Quantum channel loopholes due to imperfect implementations of practical devices expose quantum key distribution (QKD) systems to potential eavesdropping attacks. Even though QKD systems are implemented with optical devices that are highly selective on spectral characteristics, information theory-based analysis about a pertinent attack strategy built with a reasonable framework exploiting it has never been clarified. This paper proposes a new type of trojan horse attack called hidden pulse attack that can be applied in a plug-and-play QKD system, using general and optimal attack strategies that can extract quantum information from phase-disturbed quantum states of eavesdropper’s hidden pulses. It exploits spectral characteristics of a photodiode used in a plug-and-play QKD system in order to probe modulation states of photon qubits. We analyze the security performance of the decoy-state BB84 QKD system under the optimal hidden pulse attack model that shows enormous performance degradation in terms of both secret key rate and transmission distance.	informatics;plug and play;quantum key distribution	Heasin Ko;Kyongchun Lim;Junsang Oh;June-Koo Kevin Rhee	2016	Quantum Information Processing	10.1007/s11128-016-1400-2	theoretical computer science	Crypto	29.993703528551897	66.10887293028146	47768

Firstly an approximate expression of outage probability for limited-feedback opportunistic relaying is derived. Secondly the diversity gain with limited feedback is proved to be only 2 regardless of the number of potential relays or feedback accuracy, which differs from the full-diversity gain achieved by the ideal opportunistic DF relaying. Moreover, further analysis shows that with the increasing accuracy of feedback, the outage probability will approach to that of the ideal opportunistic relaying. Based on the theoretical results, a feedback method is developed to determine the minimum number of feedback bits with the outage loss under control. Simulation results confirm the theoretical analyses.	approximation algorithm;direction finding;downtime;feedback;relay;simulation	Hui Hui;Guobing Li;Xiaodong Sun	2013	2013 IEEE 78th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2013.6692316	electronic engineering;telecommunications;probability;control theory;feedback;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	36.90300329915721	76.52595279385062	47807

It is based on the parameters of 3GPP spatial channel model (SCM). For single-antenna OFDMA systems, the WINNER project proposed that the inter-cell interference can be modeled as white Gaussian noise. However, as indicated by itself, the validity of GA is not guaranteed for the scenarios with dominant interferer and multi-antenna. In this paper, the GA methodis extended into multi- antenna OFDMA systems with beamforming and the scenario with dominant interferer as well. A formula is proposed to calculate the variance of modeled Gaussian noise directly with the SCM parameters of AoD, AoA and power of each path. With this method, the complicated spatial channel models in interfering cells are not required for some applications, which help to speed up the simulation process with much lower computation and memory requirements.	approximation;beamforming;channel (communications);computation;interference (communication);requirement;simulation;snapshot (computer storage);software release life cycle	Yongquan Qiang;Guillaume Vivier;Jin Yang;Ning Xu	2008	2008 IEEE 68th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECF.2008.103	electronic engineering;supply chain management;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;statistics	EDA	44.15126545162031	85.02533377442066	47960

The algorithm first expands the equalizer-trellis to an equivalent trellis/tree structure. Then it applies the M-algorithm to the equivalent structure twice, once to reduce the number of states in the trellis, and the other to reduce the number of branches emanating from each state. To compute soft-information, the algorithm utilizes not only those fully-extended paths reaching the end of the trellis, but also paths that are traversed and discarded in the pruned trellis. We show a simple and effective method of using these discarded paths without having to store them. BER performance is presented for convolutional-coded CDMA system employing random spreading sequences. Our results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is capable of achieving single-user performance with a much reduced complexity.	algorithm;binary-coded decimal;effective method;equalization (communications);forward error correction;iterative method;multi-user;rayleigh–ritz method;simulation;tree structure;trellis quantization;x.690	Kitty K.

54f00ba8515640908207ae006bc59fc1658b448d	cooperative uav cluster-assisted terrestrial cellular networks for ubiquitous coverage		"""Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), featured by flexible configuration, robust deployment, and line-of-sight links, has a great potential to provide ubiquitous wireless coverage and high-speed transmission. In this paper, we aim to analyze the coverage performance of UAV-assisted terrestrial cellular networks, where partially energy-harvesting-powered caching UAVs are randomly deployed in the 3-D space with a minimum and maximum altitude, i.e., <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$H_{l}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$H_{h}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>. A novel cooperative UAV clustering scheme is proposed to offload ground mobile terminals (GMTs) from ground cellular base stations to cooperative UAV clusters. A cooperative UAV cluster is developed within a cylinder with projection centered on a GMT, based on their energy states, the cached contents, and the cell loads. With tractable Poisson point process and Gamma approximation, explicit expressions for the successful transmission probabilities are obtained. A theoretical analysis reveals that the cooperative probability of a UAV and the offloading probability of a GMT have bell-shaped relation with respect to the radius of the cylinder and the cache hit probability (the matching probability of a content request and content cache). Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the impacts of the system parameters on the cooperative UAV cluster. The results also give the optimal average altitude (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">${H_{l}+H_{h}}/{2}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) and altitude difference (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$H_{h}-H_{l}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) in maximizing the coverage performance with the proposed cooperative transmission scheme."""	airborne ranger;appendix;approximation;cache (computing);cluster analysis;cobham's thesis;cylinder seal;cylinder-head-sector;deploy;drug vehicle;dual;exptime;exception handling;gamma correction;integrating adc;l (complexity);lh (complexity);lu decomposition;lead pb 212 tcmc-trastuzumab;line-of-sight (missile);load balancing (computing);matching;mbnl1 gene;mice, nude;mobile applications;nl (complexity);numerical analysis;petabyte;point process;power (psychology);probability;rln2 gene;randomness;rv1399c protein, m tuberculosis;sample variance;superuser;television antenna;terrestrial television;thrombocytopenia;time complexity;transaction authentication number;unmanned aerial vehicle;contents - htmllinktype;lutex;lux unit;statistical cluster	Huici Wu;Xiaofeng Tao;Ning Zhang	2018	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2018.2864418	computer network;cache;mathematical optimization;cluster (physics);computer science;poisson point process;cluster analysis;cellular network;altitude	Mobile	27.882524202037224	84.78141598078832	48027

We define a constrained, two-player, zero-sum game between a transmitter/receiver pair and a jammer with maximum and average power constraints. We consider the case where the transmitter and the receiver use an adaptive m-layer (m ≥ 2) superposition coding scheme to communicate. We use capacity/rate as a performance measure and define the preference/utility function based on the capacity of the discrete AWGN channel. In our game model, transmitter's goal is to maximize the achievable expected performance of the communication link, defined by a utility function, while the jammer's goal is to minimize the same utility function. We provide analytical and numerical results for transmitter's and jammer's optimal strategies and prove the existence of a threshold such that when the jammer's average power exceeds this threshold, the expected payoff of the transmitter at the Nash equilibrium (NE) is the same as if the jammer uses his maximum power all the time.	additive white gaussian noise;adversary (cryptography);channel capacity;game theory;layer (electronics);maximum power transfer theorem;nash equilibrium;numerical analysis;quantum superposition;radio jamming;transmitter;utility	Koorosh Firouzbakht;Guevara Noubir;Masoud Salehi	2013	2013 47th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)	10.1109/CISS.2013.6552290	game theory;telecommunications;mathematics	Theory	35.22165298882519	84.79819419621863	48030

Second, it is shown that pipelining can be used to reduce power consumption in a timing feedback loop. A timing recovery loop has been implemented in an FPGA device and power consumption measures indicates that by including 16 extra registers in the loop the power consumption decreases a 63% and the synchronizer can process up to 66.5 MSPS.	carrier recovery;field-programmable gate array	Vicente Torres-Carot;Asuncion Perez-Pascual;T.

However, exploiting the partial knowledge leads to a significant improvement when compared to the capacity without any channel knowledge.

As the 60 GHz radio link operates only in a single-room configuration, an additional Radio over Fibre (RoF) link is used to ensure the communications in all the rooms of a residential environment. A single carrier architecture is adopted. The system uses low complexity baseband processing modules. A byte/frame synchronization technique is designed to provide a high value of the preamble detection probability and a very small value of the false alarm probability. Conventional RS (255, 239) encoder and decoder are used to correct errors in the transmission channel. Results of Bit Error Rate (BER) measurements are presented for various antennas configurations.	baseband;bit error rate;byte;channel (communications);codec;complexity;data rate units;encoder;gigabit;line-of-sight (missile);radio over fiber;reliability (computer networking);uncompressed video;x.690	Lahatra Rakotondrainibe;Yvan Kokar;Gheorghe Zaharia;Ghaïs El Zein;Eric Tanguy;Li Hongwu;Benoit Charbonier	2009	2009 6th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems		embedded system;electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering	Arch	44.496480225599115	67.29859469127385	48309

This HD employs a min-sum belief propagation (BP) decoding to correct errors, combined with erasure iterative decoding. Whenever BP decoding fails, its output is modified and artificially created erasures are introduced. The proposed HD employs an overall reduced number of iterations and achieves a similar performance to that of traditional BP decoding schemes, especially in the error-floor region, with equivalent implementation complexity.

To ensure the coexistence between the two systems operating in adjacent bands in the same geographical area, a tractable coexistence analysis approach is proposed and the outage probability is derived using stochastic geometry in this paper. Compared with the traditional Monte Carlo systemlevel simulation, our proposed interference analysis model is efficient and adaptive to the increasingly opportunistic and dense placement of base stations. Moreover, we formulate a Maximum Adjacent Channel Interference Ratio (Max-ACIR) resource scheduling algorithm, which reduces the interference from TD-LTE uplink to COMPASS downlink. Finally, protection criterion for coexistence is given via simulation.	algorithm;compass;cobham's thesis;coexist (image);compaq lte;downtime;galileo (satellite navigation);geographic coordinate system;interference (communication);monte carlo method;point process;scheduling (computing);simulation;software deployment;system-level simulation;telecommunications link	Xianghui Han;Long Zhang;Xiao Yan;Kai Chen;Jia Min;Chenxi Su;Zhiyong Feng	2014	2014 21st International Conference on Telecommunications (ICT)	10.1109/ICT.2014.6845084	electronic engineering;simulation;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;statistics	Robotics	27.49340031160503	85.18357937804879	48424

It is shown that for the case where qubit loss is detected upon measurement, the scheme performs well under 23% loss rate. For loss rates below 10% this approach performs better than the best scheme known up to date [1]. If lost qubits are tagged prior to measurement, it can tolerate up to 50% loss. The overhead per logical qubit is shown to be significantly lower than other schemes. The obtention of the threshold is entirely analytic.	code;computation;concatenation;graph state;overhead (computing);quantum computing;qubit	David A.

In particular, a scenario with multiple relays and multiple antennas at destination is analysed by considering the best relay selection jointly with optimum combining (OC). The moment-generating function (MGF) of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at destination is derived in order to evaluate the average bit-error rate (BER). The analytical results are validated using Monte-Carlo simulations for several situations, showing that the proposed scenario totally mitigates the CCI and obtains a diversity gain of N(K+1) – 1, where N is the number of antennas at destination and K is the number of cooperative relays.	bit error rate;direction finding;interference (communication);monte carlo method;relay;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;x.690	Henry W.

In the proposed scheme, the transmitter adaptively selects the index modulation pattern, consisting of the active channel subset and the associated signal constellations, according to the criterion of maximizing the minimum squared Euclidean distance. To reduce the complexity, first, the number of candidate patterns in the selection procedure is reduced by employing the relation of the normalized signal constellations with different modulation orders. Second, a simple lookup table method is presented. Finally, the performance of the proposed scheme is demonstrated in both the scenarios of multicarrier transmission and multiantenna transmission by computer simulations.	aim alliance;additive white gaussian noise;computer simulation;euclidean distance;lookup table;modulation;transmitter	Jianping Zheng	2016	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2015.2477078	database index;delta modulation;transmitter;electronic engineering;quadrature amplitude modulation;constellation diagram;telecommunications;computer science;phase-shift keying;resource management;theoretical computer science;mathematics;pulse-position modulation;analog transmission;quadrature modulation	ML	39.847280091357376	83.38056817498929	48470

However, the imperfect island fabrication process results in unavoidable variations in the geometry of the islands, which introduces deterministic changes in the replay signal and leads to errors in the conventional Maximum Likelihood (ML) detector. If the detector can be extended to include estimates of island size, then detector decisions can be improved and error rates reduced. A read channel is proposed that reduces the impact of island size variations by modifying the detector trellis to include two extra branches per state transition to improve the data error rate at the output of the detector. An analytical model of the modified read channel is developed that is capable of rapidly estimating the bit-error-rate (BER) performance so that the modified read channel trellis parameters can be optimized to maximize the BER improvement offered by the proposed detector. In order to verify the performance of the analytical model its output is compared with that produced from a numerical model, which takes full account of multi-bit inter-symbol interference.	beam propagation method;bit error rate;computer simulation;hard disk drive;interference (communication);mathematical model;numerical analysis;partial-response maximum-likelihood;patterned media;performance evaluation;semiconductor device fabrication;signal-to-noise ratio;speedup;trellis quantization;x.690	Yuanjing Shi;Paul W.

Information hiding is an emerging research area which encompasses applications such as copyright protection for digital media, watermarking, fingerprinting, steganography, and data embedding. In these applications, information is hidden within a host data set and is to be reliably communicated to a receiver. The host data set is intentionally corrupted, but in a covert way, designed to be imperceptible to a casual analysis. Next, an attacker may seek to destroy this hidden information, and for this purpose, introduce additional distortion to the data set. Side information (in the form of cryptographic keys and/or information about the host signal) may be available to the information hider and to the decoder. We formalize these notions and evaluate thehiding capacity, which upper-bounds the rates of reliable transmission and quantifies the fundamental tradeoff between three quantities: the achievable information-hiding rates and the allowed distortion levels for the information hider and the attacker. The hiding capacity is the value of a game between the information hider and the attacker. The optimal attack strategy is the solution of a particular rate-distortion problem, and the optimal hiding strategy is the solution to a channel-coding problem. The hiding capacity is derived by extending the Gel’fand–Pinsker theory of communication with side information at the encoder. The extensions include the presence of distortion constraints, side information at the decoder, and unknown communication channel. Explicit formulas for capacity are given in several cases, including Bernoulli and Gaussian problems, as well as the important special case of small distortions. In some cases, including the last two above, the hiding capacity is the same whether or not the decoder knows the host data set. It is shown that many existing information-hiding systems in the literature operate far below capacity.	bernoulli polynomials;channel (communications);cryptography;digital media;digital watermarking;distortion;encoder;fingerprint (computing);forward error correction;gaussian (software);hidden surface determination;information theory;key (cryptography);steganography	Pierre Moulin;Joseph A.

Such access allows users to share novel multimedia applications without any geographical restrictions. In this paper, we investigate the application of the well-known antimultipath spread spectrum code-division multiple access (SS-CDMA) techniques to image transmission related to the development of next-generation multimedia wireless local area networks within a building. SS-CDMA is particularly well suited to a subband coding scheme that divides the image information into multiple parallel data streams using an analysis filter bank, each of which is multiplied by its unique spreading code. All the product signals are then transmitted at the same time in the same radio channel, even though the total bandwidth of all the signals may exceed the channel bandwidth. Each received signal is independently recovered at the decoder by multiplying its spreading code and all the recovered subbands are then reassembled by a synthesis filter bank into a close reproduction to the original image. A forward error correction (FEC) scheme based on convolutional codes with interleaving is proposed to minimize the effect of bursty channel errors on the picture quality degradation. Better image quality can be achieved by using the predetection diversity combining in order to combat the indoor multipath distortion. In this paper, the image quality of subband image transmission via SS-CDMA indoor fading channels with differential phase shift keying (DPSK) modulation is evaluated and examined. Simulation results show that the image peak signal-to-noise (PSNR) ratio is inversely related to a logarithmic function of bit error rate when each subband employs equal protection channel coding.	accessibility;bit error rate;convolutional code;differential phase;distortion;elegant degradation;error detection and correction;filter bank;forward error correction;image quality;key (cryptography);modulation;multipath propagation;peak signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;sub-band coding;whole earth 'lectronic link	Bor-Chin Wang;Po-Rong Chang	1996	IEEE Trans.

Low-complexity distributions are designed to mimic the Gibbs distribution, where the latter is the optimal distribution used in the standard DA method. These low-complexity distributions are simple enough to facilitate fast computation, but at the same time they can closely approximate the Gibbs distribution to result in near-optimal performance. We have also derived the theoretical performance loss at a given system entropy due to using the simple soft measures instead of the optimal Gibbs measure. We use the derived result to obtain optimal annealing schedules for the simple soft measures that approximate the annealing schedule for the optimal Gibbs distribution. The proposed reducedcomplexity DA algorithms have significantly improved the quality of the final codebooks compared to the generalized Lloyd algorithm and standard stochastic relaxation techniques, both with and without the pairwise nearest neighbor (PNN) codebook initialization. The proposed algorithms are able to evade the local minima and the results show that they are not sensitive to the choice of the initial codebook. Compared to the standard DA approach, the reduced-complexity DA algorithms can operate over 100 times faster with negligible performance difference. For example, for the design of a 16-dimensional vector quantizer having a rate of 0.4375 bit/sample for Gaussian source, the standard DA algorithm achieved 3.60 dB performance in 16 483 CPU seconds, whereas the reduced-complexity DA algorithm achieved the same performance in 136 CPU seconds. Other than VQ design, the DA techniques are applicable to problems such as classification, clustering, and resource allocation.	approximation algorithm;central processing unit;cluster analysis;codebook;computation;decibel;information processing;linde–buzo–gray algorithm;linear programming relaxation;maxima and minima;powell's method;quantization (signal processing);simulated annealing;statistical classification;vector quantization	Kemal Demirciler;Antonio Ortega	2005	EURASIP J.

We present rateless coding schemes for two adversarial models, where the source sends more redundancy over time, until decoding succeeds. The first model assumes there is a secret channel between the source and the destination that the adversaries cannot overhear. The rate of the channel is negligible compared to the main network. In the second model the source and destination share random secrets independent of the input information. The amount of secret information required is negligible compared to the amount of information sent. Both schemes are capacity optimal, distributed, polynomial-time and end-to-end in that other than the source and destination nodes, other intermediate nodes carry out classical random linear network coding.	algorithm;arithmetic coding;code;ecc memory;end-to-end principle;error detection and correction;error message;linear network coding;multicast;polynomial;time complexity	Wentao Huang;Tracey Ho;Hongyi Yao;Sidharth Jaggi	2013	2013 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM	10.1109/INFCOM.2013.6566776	list decoding;linear network coding;online codes;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;distributed computing;statistics;computer network	Crypto	32.99543933622565	68.39375978628132	48593

The adaptive strategy adjusts the number of active users, denoted as the transmission mode, to balance transmit array gain, spatial division multiplexing gain, and residual inter-user interference. Accurate closed-form approximations are derived for the achievable rates for different modes, which help identify the active mode that maximizes the average sum throughput for given feedback delay and channel quantization error. The proposed transmission strategy can be easily combined with round-robin scheduling to serve a large number of users. As instantaneous channel information is not exploited, the proposed algorithm cannot provide multiuser diversity gain, but it is still able to provide throughput gain over single-user MIMO at moderate signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, it has a light feedback overhead and only requires feedback of instantaneous channel state information from a small number of users. In the system with a feedback load constraint, it is shown that the proposed algorithm provides performance close to that achieved by opportunistic scheduling with instantaneous feedback from a large number of users.	algorithm;approximation;channel state information;interference (communication);multi-user mimo;multiplexing;overhead (computing);quantization (signal processing);round-robin scheduling;scheduling (computing);signal-to-noise ratio;spectral efficiency;throughput	Jun Zhang;Marios Kountouris;Jeffrey G.

3d1713d069af33df0888743eea2e057dbf8afe04	cumulant based operating point estimation for communication satellite transponders		A particular problem in satellite communications is the estimation of the current operating point of a bent-pipe transponder. Various special effects aggravate this estimation problem, among which the capture effect, gain compression, unknown attenuation in the transmission channel, or noisy received signals are the most prominent. In most practical cases, operators desire a fully blind estimator that is nevertheless able to cope with these unwanted impairments. We provide the theoretical background and further results on a novel estimator based on signal statistics that enables accurate operating point estimation in multicarrier operation as well as in single carrier mode with higher-order modulation. In this paper we focus on three basic use cases for our estimator, and we discuss results on the estimation accuracy.	additive white gaussian noise;approximation;capture effect;channel (communications);communications satellite;computational complexity theory;gain compression;input/output;modulation;nonlinear system;open biomedical ontologies;operating point;performance per watt;portable document format;requirement;software propagation;telecommunications link;transponder (satellite communications)	Matthias G.

The relay-assisted data transmission from two source nodes to two destination nodes is carried out based on either physical-layer network coding (PLNC) or analog network coding (ANC) techniques. The reliability of communications in wireless network-coded butterfly networks (WNCBNs) is assured by applying hybrid automatic repeat request protocol with incremental redundancy (HARQ-IR). In this paper, we first evaluate the total energy consumption (EC) of both PLNC and ANC schemes in WNCBNs. Based on the derived EC, we develop algorithms that optimize the location of the relay node for PLNC and ANC schemes in order to minimize the total EC for a green communication system subject to node location and power allocation constraints. Finally, simulation results are provided which identify the optimized relay locations for various scenarios of node location and power allocation in the WNCBN.	algorithm;hybrid automatic repeat request;linear network coding;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;rp (complexity);relay;simulation;wireless router	Quoc-Tuan Vien;Huan Xuan Nguyen;Wanqing Tu	2013	2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666147	communications protocol;linear network coding;global positioning system;telecommunications;computer science;relay channel;automatic repeat request;computer network	Mobile	32.962668327037264	84.23357677976536	48733

It is used to estimate the probability of symbol error, including the effect of symbol slip, for different frame and signaling alphabet sizes. The new figure of merit proves to provide a significantly more accurate characterisation than previously published methods. Specifically, by applying the novel figure of merit, the paper compares the symbol synchronisation performance of a conventional digital phase locked loop (DPLL) symbol synchroniser with that of modulation-derived synchroniser (MDS) under additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel conditions.	additive white gaussian noise;dpll algorithm;modulation;phase-locked loop;utility functions on indivisible goods	Churn Don Lee;Michael Darnell	2001		10.1109/ICC.2001.936965	additive white gaussian noise;synchronization;figure of merit;phase-locked loop;digital filter;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;phase modulation	ML	44.797316099634386	69.74878452515266	48789

In this paper, the coverage probability for the downlink HSCN with three cell association methods, namely the nearest association, the N-th nearest association and the maximum received power based association, is analyzed. Particularly, small cell base stations SCBSs randomly deployed in each floor are modeled as a spatial Poisson point process (PPP) distribution, and the stochastic geometry tool is used to evaluate the coverage probability. Different from the traditional outdoor scenario, the penetration loss is considered and the corresponding impact on the coverage probability is analyzed. The closed-form expressions of coverage probability for these three association methods are derived for HSCNs in the dense K-floor indoor scenarios. Simulation results validate the accuracy of our analysis and show that the coverage performance for the maximum received power based association method is much better than that of the N-th nearest association method regardless of the SCBS density in each floor. Meanwhile, the nearest association approaches the the maximum received power based association method when the SCBS density is high.	fifth generation computer;gigabit;point process;programming paradigm;randomness;simulation;telecommunications link	Shi Yan;Mugen Peng;Wei Chen;Jiaheng Wang;Munzali Ahmed Abana;Lingfeng Yang	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)	10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247561	simulation;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;antenna;interference;shadow mapping	Robotics	27.595563180817358	84.7271406999428	48794

To obtain our bound, we start by proposing a closed form upper bound for Gaussian Q-function and as well as deriving a new lower bound of each channel covariance matrix eigenvalue. The simulation results show that our proposed bound is tighter than those previously developed, especially when the covariance parameter q increases. A gain of over 6.5dB was achieved for q = 0.95 at BER=10-5 from the better previous bound, whereas for the lower values of q we reach the simulated curve.	bit error rate;coefficient;convolutional code;rayleigh fading;simulation;time complexity	Yassine Mouchtak;Faissal El Bouanani	2016	2016 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2016.7577171	mathematical optimization;convolutional code;telecommunications;upper and lower bounds;integral equation;communications system;statistics	Robotics	39.628506615045204	74.71768732824896	48868

While the frequency or timing offset increases at a given SNR, the BER is severely degraded. When the system is affected only by either of two offsets, and normalized offset is less than 0.3, the timing offset has a worse influence upon the FFH-MA system than the frequency offset. For the SNR of more than 20dB, the threshold level of the receiver suffering from the frequency and timing offsets should be greater than that of the perfectly synchronized receiver.	bit error rate;elegant degradation;frequency offset;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;interference (communication);key (cryptography);modulation;offset (computer science);rayleigh fading;signal-to-noise ratio;x.690	Jeungmin Joo;Sungdon Moon;Yeomin Yoon;Kiseon Kim	2003		10.1109/WCNC.2003.1200332	real-time computing;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;rayleigh fading;frequency deviation;frequency offset;frequency-shift keying;statistics	Mobile	43.84939231199672	76.5173430029388	48902
dc130348eb4bb18c5d9cbf6f38b7a0716bae13e4	impact of “better than nyquist” pulse shaping in gfdm phy with lte-compatible frame structure		The shifting towards New Radio waveforms for future cellular networks will require a smooth transition from the existing 4G physical layer (PHY), which is based on the LongTerm Evolution-Advance (LTE-A) system. This will allow the service provider to develop less cost multi-standard devices that rely on the same master clock compatibility and with the same time-frequency grid representation of the LTE-A. The main characteristic of generalized frequency-division multiplexing (GFDM) modulation is low out-of-band (OOB) emission, accomplished by using flexible pulse shape filtering in the timedomain of individual subcarriers. In this paper, first we focus on the integration of GFDM in the time-frequency grid of the LTE-A system and then we analyze the impact of “Better than Nyquist” pulse shaping filters on OOB emission and symbol error rate. We consider different “Better than Nyquist” pulse shaping filters that were originally introduced in single-carrier modulation schemes to reduce the sensitivity to symbol timing error. By using the results available in the literature, the performance achieved by “Better than Nyquist” pulse shaping filters is compared to that achieved by conventional Nyquist ones. The concept of the wavelet, based on the Meyer auxiliary function, along with pulse shaping filter will be also addressed. The results are presented for 16-QAM in the case of transmission over AWGN, time-varying frequency flat, and static frequency selective fading channels. Monte Carlo simulations are shown in order to validate the accuracy of the analytical expressions.	additive white gaussian noise;ampersand;clock rate;compaq lte;interference (communication);meyer wavelet;modulation;monte carlo method;multiplexing;noise shaping;nyquist rate;out-of-bag error;out-of-band agreement;phy (chip);pulse shaping;simulation;subcarrier;tatsunoko vs. capcom:;traffic shaping;wavelet;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Atul Kumar;Maurizio Magarini;Stefano Bregni	2017	2017 IEEE 9th Latin-American Conference on Communications (LATINCOM)	10.1109/LATINCOM.2017.8240192	fading;filter (signal processing);frequency-division multiplexing;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;pulse shaping;modulation;pulse (signal processing);orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;electronic engineering;computer science	Mobile	47.114853661926766	82.48295409842811	48907

A crucial issue in implementing anytime transmission strategies is the design of anytime codes that offer good finite-length performance and asymptotic anytime properties. This paper introduces an efficient anytime code derived from protograph-based low-density parity-check convolutional codes known as extended S-LDPCC (XS-LDPCC) codes. The asymptotic anytime properties of XS-LDPCC codes over both the binary erasure channel (BEC) and the binary-input additive white Gaussian noise (BIAWGN) channel are demonstrated through density evolution. By means of certain observations verified by simulations, we provide accurate estimates of the delay exponents of XS-LDPCC codes over the BEC and the BIAWGN channel. Through simulations, the finite-length performance of XS-LDPCC codes and the effects of different code design parameters are quantified.	additive white gaussian noise;anytime algorithm;binary erasure channel;control theory;convolutional code;low-density parity-check code;simulation;utility functions on indivisible goods;xs (perl)	Nan Zhang;Md.

This paper addresses the question to which extent this result carries over to multi-hop networks. Specifically, an L + 1-hop network with n non-cooperative source antennas, n fully cooperative destination antennas, and L relay stages of n<sub>R</sub> (cooperative or non-cooperative) relay antennas each is considered. Four relaying strategies are assessed based on the interrelationship be- tween two sequences. For each considered strategy XF, there exists a sequence (c<sub>L</sub><sup>XF</sup>)<sub>L=o</sub><sup>∞</sup>, such that c<sub>L</sub><sup>XF</sup> = lim<sub>n</sub> → ∞ R<sub>L</sub><sup>XF</sup>/n almost surely, where R<sub>L</sub><sup>XF</sup> denotes the supremum of the set of sumrates that are achievable by the strategy over L + 1 hops. This sequence depends on the sequence (P<sub>L</sub>)<sub>L=o</sub><sup>∞</sup>, where P<sub>L</sub> corresponds to the power of the source stage and each of the relay stages in an Z+1-hop network. Results are summarized as follows: · Decode & forward (DF): For n<sub>R</sub> = n, c<sub>L</sub><sup>DF</sup> is constant with respect to L, if also P<sub>L</sub> is constant with respect to L. · Quantize & forward with (CF) and without (QF) Slepian & Wolf compression: For n<sub>R</sub> = n, there exists a sequence (P<sub>L</sub>)<sub>L=o</sub><sup>∞</sup>, such that c<sub>L</sub><sup>QF/CF</sup> is positive and constant with respect to L. The corresponding sequence (P<sub>L</sub>)<sub>L=o</sub><sup>∞</sup> grows linearly with L for CF and exponentially with L for QF. · Amplify & forward (AF): Fix n<sub>R</sub>/n = β and P<sub>L</sub> ∝ L. Then, (i) there exists c >; 0, such that lim<sub>L</sub> -<sub>∞</sub> c<sub>L</sub><sup>ΛΓ</sup> = c, if β ∈ Ω (L<sup>1+ε</sup>) and (ii) lim<sub>L</sub> → <sub>∞</sub> c<sub>L</sub><sup>AF</sup> = 0, if β ∈ O (L<sup>1-ε</sup>).	anisotropic filtering;direction finding;expanded memory;hop;internet relay chat;telecommunications link	Jörg Wagner;Armin Wittneben	2012	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2011.2177752	quantization;telecommunications;computer science;noise;random matrix;mathematics;channel capacity	Theory	35.44055313567713	73.91278952925562	48975

We apply an iterative Monte Carlo based approach called the Cross-Entropy method to produce, in every iteration, a set of random error locator vectors, each indicates n-k possible erasure positions within a received word. We associate each error locator vector with a candidate codeword by erasures-only decoding the received word, using the error locator vector to locate the erasures. Each iteration results in a new elite set that contains the best E candidate codewords. To increase the search radius and enhance the decoder performance we use the randomly drawn samples to generate what we call virtual received words from which extra candidate codewords and thus candidate elite members can be obtained. The proposed algorithms offer both complexity and performance advantages over some existing algebraic decoding algorithms for high rate RS codes.	algorithm;code word;cross-entropy method;folded reed–solomon code;iteration;linear algebra;list decoding;monte carlo method;online locator service;randomness;reed–solomon error correction;stochastic computing	Chang-Ming Lee;Yu Ted Su	2009	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2009.2022792	list decoding;stochastic process;combinatorics;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;algorithm;statistics;monte carlo method	ML	41.57230500202899	61.06106794199471	49041

However, in the CDMA reverse link, the base station knows the signature sequences of users in its cell, but has no knowledge of interfering users from other cells. In this paper, we develop a class of novel semi-blind technique for multiuser detection in such a scenario. This approach fully utilizes all known users' information, performs multistage parallel or serial interference cancellation to suppress the interferers within the cell, and exploits a blind adaptive decision-feedback MMSE detector to suppress the inter-cell interference.

The rate can be easily changed on the slot basis in a frame transmission by adapting the order of multidimensional signaling to the incoming traffics. The multidimensional signaling of order zero simply reduces to conventional multicode scheme, so there exists a tradeoff between rate and complexity. Also, the use of multidimensional signaling results in far reduced envelope variations at the maximum rate. With the transmit diversity, the uplink signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) will be further stabilized to meet the requirements of multimedia traffics. Statistics of interferences are characterized in terms of their secondand fourth-order moments from which diversity gain is theoretically verified. For realistic multipath fading channels, considering both equal and unequal average path powers, the average probability of symbol error is obtained in compact form, in which the two schemes, multidimensional signaling with and without transmit diversity are compared, and then with nonmulticode scheme in view of the bit error rate (BER). Numerical and simulation results show that the multidimensional signal with transmit diversity provides a significant gain over that with no diversity, and furthermore outperforms nonmulticode scheme subject to the same signal energy per bit and chip rate.	bit error rate;interference (communication);multidimensional signal processing;multipath propagation;numerical linear algebra;requirement;simulation;telecommunications link;x.690	Dong In Kim;Vijay K.

Based on numerical analyses, the power efficiency of the LCPIC receiver is close to that of the 3-stage PIC receiver and better than that of the 2-stage PIC receiver in AWGN with either perfect power control or log-normal power control error. In addition, the near-far resistance of the LCPIC, 2-stage, 3-stage PIC, and SIC receivers are analogous since their performances are undistinguishable in near-far channels. Still more, the computational complexity, which is in terms of the needs of flops per bit decision, of the LCPIC receiver is much less than that of the 3-stage PIC receiver and only a little more than that of the 2-stage PIC receiver.	interference (communication)	Chao-Wang Huang;Kuei-Ann Wen	2001		10.1109/VTC.2001.956893	code division multiple access;electronic engineering;electrical efficiency;telecommunications;power control;computer science;theoretical computer science;log-normal distribution;radio receiver design;radio receiver;computational complexity theory;spread spectrum	Metrics	43.77787662641856	76.12111674316913	49221

The analysis and numerical results suggest that the achievable diversity order is the product of the frequency-selective diversity order and the transmit diversity order. Furthermore, both the transmit diversity and the frequency-selective diversity have the same order of importance. Since W-CDMA signals are subjected to frequencyselective fading, the number of resolvable paths at the receiver may vary over a wide range depending on the transmission environment encountered. It can be shown that, for wireless channels where the frequency selectivity is sufficiently high, transmit diversity may be not necessitated. Under this case, multiple transmission antennas can be leveraged into an increased bitrate. Therefore, an adaptive STS-based transmission scheme is then proposed for improving the throughput of W-CDMA systems. Our numerical results demonstrate that this adaptive STS-based transmission scheme is capable of significantly improving the effective throughput of W-CDMA systems. Specifically, the studied W-CDMA system’s bitrate can be increased by a factor of three at the modest cost of requiring an extra 0.4 dB or 1.2 dB transmitted power in the context of the investigated urban or suburban areas, respectively.	bandwidth (signal processing);data rate units;decibel;dispersive partial differential equation;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;multi-user;multipath propagation;numerical analysis;open research;qr code;selectivity (electronic);throughput;transceiver;transmitter;x.690;xojo	Lie-Liang Yang;Lajos Hanzo Hanzo	2005	EURASIP J.

By exploiting varying channel conditions, adaptive modulation can be used in ad hoc networks to provide upper layers with higher capacity links over which to relay traffic. Using the /spl alpha/-stable interference model, the distribution of the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) is obtained for a slotted system of randomly, uniformly distributed nodes using multilevel coherent modulation schemes. Performance is evaluated in terms of the information efficiency, which is a new progress-related measure for multihop networks. Three types of adaptivity are analyzed, differing in the level of CSI available: 1) full knowledge of the SIR at the receiver; 2) knowledge of only the signal attenuation due to fading; and 3) knowledge of only the slow fading component of the signal attenuation. The effect of imperfect channel information is also investigated. Sample results are given for interference-limited networks experiencing fourth-power path loss with distance, Ricean fading, and lognormal shadowing.	channel state information;coherence (physics);entropy (information theory);hoc (programming language);interference (communication);modulation;network packet;randomness;relay;robustness (computer science)	Michael R.

By exploiting the block sparsity of channel matrix and channel reciprocity in TDD mode, the auxiliary information based block subspace pursuit (ABSP) algorithm is proposed to recover the downlink channels, where the path delays acquired from uplink training is utilized as the auxiliary information. Unlike traditional approaches where the channel estimation overhead is proportional to the number of BS antennas, the proposed approach could provide an accurate channel estimation approaching the performance bound while reduce the pilot overhead by nearly one-third.	algorithm;channel state information;compressed sensing;multi-user mimo;overhead (computing);sparse matrix;telecommunications link;test-driven development	Yang Nan;Xiang Lin;Xin Sun	2015	IEEE Wireless Communications Letters	10.1109/LWC.2015.2414933	telecommunications link;telecommunications;control theory;mathematics;precoding;statistics;mimo	Mobile	49.48728986989289	80.84200457978491	49356

This alignment is essential for decoding the spread spectrum signal. The customary approach is to start each CDMA packet with a data-free preamble that facilitates codephase alignment in the receiver. Since packets can be short, processing must be rapid and so we use the parallel processing of a transversal matched filter correlator. We include segmentation of the matched filter to allow codephase testing even when there are data transitions. This eliminates the need for a preamble and the entire packet can contain data. Segmentation also increases tolerance to Doppler shifts caused by motion or by carrier frequency mismatch. To increase the probability of correct codephase acquisition, matched filter samples are accumulated over several code cycles prior to making the codephase decision. Correct detection probabilities exceeding 99% are indicated from simulations with 25 co-users and 10 kHz Doppler shift	carrier frequency;cross-correlation;doppler effect;matched filter;network packet;parallel computing;simulation	Md.

In addition, the results clarify that the proposed receiver does not incur non-coherent combining loss, and at the same time, lower bounds the performance of the conventional non-coherent equal-gain combining (NC-EGC) receiver.

Diversity is obtained using multiple hops per data bit. Noise-normalization combining is employed by the system receiver to minimize partial-band interference effects. The partial-band interference is modeled as a Gaussian process. Thermal noise is also included in the analysis. Forward error correction coding is applied using convolutional codes and Reed-Solomon codes. Diversity is found to dramatically reduce the degradation of the noise-normalization receiver caused by partial-band interference regardless of the strength of the direct signal component. Diversity offers significant performance improvement when channel fading is strong, and performance improvement is obtained for high modulation orders (M>2). Receiver performance is improved when diversity, higher modulation orders, and coding are combined. >	interference (communication)	R. Clark Robertson;Tri T. Ha	1992	IEEE Trans.

In the iterative ASPIC, replicas of the interference from different transmit antennas are generated and subtracted from the received signals. The log-likelihood ratio (LLR) sequence, obtained as the turbo decoder output, is fed back for iterative interference cancellation. At the transmitter, the information bit sequences and parity bit sequences are transmitted from different antennas. The achievable bit error rate (BER) performance of turbo coded MIMO multiplexing with the proposed iterative ASPIC in a Rayleigh fading channel is evaluated by computer simulation.	bit error rate;computer simulation;interference (communication);iteration;iterative method;lucas–lehmer–riesel test;mimo;multiplexing;parity bit;rayleigh fading;transmitter;x.690	Akinori Nakajima;Deepshikha Garg;Fumiyuki Adachi	2004	IEEE 60th Vehicular Technology Conference, 2004.

The recent work by Li and Yeung examined the network capacity of multicast networks and related capacity to cutsets. Capacity is achieved by coding over a network. We present a new framework for studying networks and their capacity. Our framework, based on algebraic methods, is surprisingly simple and effective. For networks which are restricted to using linear codes (we make precise later the meaning of linear codes, since the codes are not bit-wise linear), we find necessary and sufficient conditions for any given set of connections to be achievable over a given network. For multicast connections, linear codes are not a restrictive assumption, since all achievable connections can be achieved using linear codes. Moreover, coding can be used to maintain connections after permanent failures such as the removal of an edge from the network. We show necessary and sufficient conditions for a set of connections to be robust to a set of permanent failures. For multicast connections, we show the rather surprising result that, if a multicast connection is achievable under different failure scenarios, a single static code can ensure robustness of the connection under all of those failure scenarios.	directed acyclic graph;flow network;linear algebra;linear code;linear network coding;multicast;nonlinear system;overhead (computing);requirement;robustness of complex networks;routing	Muriel Médard;Ralf Koetter	2002		10.1109/INFCOM.2002.1019253	routing;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Theory	32.0898880284046	71.48579598672384	49530

It has been shown that UW-OFDM has better spectral properties and also a superior bit error ratio (BER) performance over conventional cyclic prefix (CP) based OFDM. In UW-OFDM, the CPs are replaced by deterministic sequences, the so-called unique words (UWs). This is achieved by adding redundancy in the frequency domain with the help of a code generator matrix at the transmitter which introduces correlation between the data symbols. A superior BER performance is achieved if the code generator matrix is utilized efficiently in the detection procedure. In wireless communication systems multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques are widely used to improve the overall spectral and energy efficiency by exploiting the multiple antennas. So far, the performance of UW-OFDM has been well investigated for single-input single-output (SISO) systems. In this work, we expand our investigation of UW-OFDM to MIMO systems and propose two detection approaches. We show that similar to CP-OFDM, a subcarrier wise detection is also possible for UW-OFDM. But in addition an efficient code generator demodulator is required to take advantage of the correlation introduced in the data symbols. The results show that UW-OFDM outperforms CP-OFDM significantly but requires a higher computational complexity.	bit error rate;code generation (compiler);computational complexity theory;frequency divider;generator matrix;mimo;mimo-ofdm;matched filter;multiplexing;soft-in soft-out decoder;subcarrier;transmitter;x.690	Sher Ali Cheema;Jianshu Zhang;Mario Huemer;Martin Haardt	2016	2016 50th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers	10.1109/ACSSC.2016.7869618	electronic engineering;multi-user mimo;mimo-ofdm;telecommunications;theoretical computer science;mathematics	HPC	45.42014381133675	79.51034363584957	49554

Although many authors have analyzed the secrecy performance of SISO system over various fading, the secrecy performance in the cases we assume has not been clarified. Furthermore, the simulation and numerical results show that the results using the approximation between Rician and Nakagami-$m$ fading is insufficient in evaluating those probabilities because of only approximation to main bodies of the probability density function, and that our analyses are valid.	approximation;downtime;numerical analysis;profiling (computer programming);simulation interoperability standards organization;soft-in soft-out decoder	Shunya Iwata;Tomoaki Ohtsuki;Pooi Yuen Kam	2017	2017 IEEE 85th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2017.8108517	outage probability;fading;electronic engineering;rician fading;physical layer;mathematics;fading distribution;communication channel;nakagami distribution	EDA	37.99995903557834	78.01303717545369	49598

With the optimal list of codeword lengths, an optimal canonical code can be easily obtained. If W is already sorted, then this optimal code can also be represented by the list M = [m1; : : : ;mH ], wherem`, for ` = 1; : : : ; H , denotes the number of codewords with length ` andH is the length of the longest codeword. Fortunately, H is proved to beO(minflog(1=p1); ng, wherep1 is the smallest symbol probability, given by w1= Pn i=1 wi. The E-LazyHuff algorithm uses a lazy approach to calculate optimal codes inO(n log(n=H)) time, requiring onlyO(H) additional space. In addition, the input weights are not destroyed during the code calculation. In this paper, we propose a new technique, which we call homogenization, that can be used to improve the time efficiency of algorithms for constructing optimal prefix codes. Next, we introduce the Best LazyHuff algorithm (B-LazyHuff) as an application of this technique. B-LazyHuff is an O(n)-time variation of the E-LazyHuff algorithm. It also requires O(H) additional space and does not destroy the input data.	algorithm;best, worst and average case;code word;comment (computer programming);data buffer;data structure;in-place algorithm;lazy evaluation;prefix code;run time (program lifecycle phase);worst-case execution time	Ruy Luiz Milidiú;Artur Alves Pessoa;Eduardo Sany Laber	1999		10.1109/SPIRE.1999.796587	data compression;prefix code;combinatorics;homogenization;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;redundancy;computational complexity theory;code;algorithm;statistics;huffman coding	Theory	37.7045821398233	60.846354641771846	49599

After applying the discrete-Fourier-transform operation to the output of each antenna, one estimates the signal-plus-interference spatial correlation matrix by selecting the samples at ldquononzero-valuedrdquo subcarriers and the interference-alone spatial correlation matrix by choosing those samples at ldquozero-valuedrdquo subcarriers (also known as virtual carriers). The beamforming weight vector is the ldquolargestrdquo generalized eigenvector of the resulting matrix pencil, wherein the solution is computed in a batch fashion. By using a limited number of samples, the proposed scheme offers competitive performance compared with that of the scheme using optimal beamforming weight vectors that are calculated for each subcarrier under small-angular-spread scenarios. The adaptive solution for calculating the beamforming weight vector is also derived. The proposed schemes are shown to be suitable in scenarios of narrow angular spread with exponential power delay profile. The simulations that are presented here employ the OFDM signal model to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms.	algorithm;angularjs;beamforming;discrete fourier transform;interference (communication);multiplexing;simulation;subcarrier;time complexity	Yung-Fang Chen;Chia-Shu Wang	2007	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2007.897653	electronic engineering;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;signal processing;control theory;wsdma;mathematics	Mobile	50.57860101106904	73.12417732038969	49655

Unlike the conventional sensing-based spectrum sharing, where there are two transmit power levels corresponding to whether the PU is sensed present or not, in the proposed strategy, the power levels are continuous functions of the sensing statistics, and optimized with respect to the achievable rate of the SU. The continuous power allocation function is parameterized by some channel parameters of the PU and SU, and we treat the cases of perfect and quantized channel state information (CSI) separately, where the former provides an upper bound on the achievable rate with full channel information; and the latter constitutes an efficient practical power allocation method for the SU with statistic/partial channel information. The power control process consists of two phases: in the first phase, the SU listens to the multiple bands licensed to the PU and obtains the sensing statistics, e.g., the received signal energies on these bands; in the second phase, the SU adjusts its transmit power levels on these bands based on the sensing results. Optimal power allocation schemes are derived to maximize the achievable rate at the SU under several possible combinations of the peak/average transmit power constraints at the SU and the peak/average interference power constraints at the PU. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategies can significantly improve the achievable throughput of the SU compared to the conventional methods.	channel state information;cognitive radio;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);one-class classification;simulation;superuser;throughput	Zhong Chen;Xiaodong Wang;Xianda Zhang	2013	21st European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO 2013)	10.1109/JSAC.2013.131126	cognitive radio;quality of service;telecommunications;power control;resource allocation;computer science;sensor;resource management;interference;channel state information;statistics;computer network	Mobile	34.24320450041639	85.95621836958004	49743

We generalize the concept of stopping sets to non-binary LDPC codes. We give a combinatorial characterization of decoding failures for non-binary LDPC codes decoded via Belief Propagation (BP). Using the density evolution analysis, we compute the asymptotic residual degree distribution for non-binary LDPC codes. In order to show that asymptotically almost every code in the non-binary LDPC ensemble has a rate equal to the design rate, we generalize the arguments of Measson, Montanari, and Urbanke to the non-binary setting. This generalization enables us to compute the conditional entropy of non-binary LDPC codes. We observe that the Maxwell construction of Measson, Montanari, and Urbanke relating the performance of MAP and BP decoding, holds in the setting of non-binary LDPC codes.	belief propagation;binary erasure channel;conditional entropy;degree distribution;low-density parity-check code;maxwell (microarchitecture);qr code	Vishwambhar Rathi	2008	2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595126	block code;concatenated error correction code;entropy;turbo code;binary erasure channel;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;low-density parity-check code;degree distribution;computer science;theoretical computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;tornado code;mathematics;forward error correction;error floor;conditional entropy;statistics;belief propagation	Theory	39.833674185368665	61.41773087034235	49749

To this end, we have derived the novel expressions for the probability of detection (PD) and the average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Furthermore, the asymptotic analysis of such performance metrics has been carried out and the simpler and closed-form expressions of the PD and the average AUC have been proposed with maximal ratio combining,  equal gain combining, and selection combining diversity schemes. Finally, the derived results have been applied to cooperative system considering erroneous channel between secondary users and a fusion center. The derived expressions are valid for both integer and non-integer values of the multipath and shadowing parameters. The derived analytical results are corroborated by both exact numerical results and Monte-Carlo simulations, and it is shown that the performance of cooperative system not only depends on the parameters of composite fading distribution but also on the erroneous feed-back channel.

899453d6d1b42212e786e9df5c7d453ee451870c	low-latency software ldpc decoders for x86 multi-core devices		LDPC codes are a family of error correcting codes used in most modern digital communication standards even in future 3GPP 5G standard. Thanks to their high processing power and their parallelization capabilities, prevailing multi-core and many-core devices facilitate real-time implementations of digital communication systems, which were previously implemented on dedicated hardware targets. Through massive frame decoding parallelization, current LDPC decoders throughputs range from hundreds of Mbps up to Gbps. However, inter-frame parallelization involves latency penalties, while in future 5G wireless communication systems, the latency should be reduced as far as possible. To this end, a novel LDPC parallelization approach for LDPC decoding on a multi-core processor device is proposed in this article. It reduces the processing latency down to some microseconds as highlighted by x86 multi-core experimentations.	arm architecture;data rate units;error detection and correction;iteration;low-density parity-check code;manycore processor;multi-core processor;parallel computing;qr code;real-time clock;throughput;x86	Bertrand Le Gal;Christophe Jégo	2017	2017 IEEE International Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)	10.1109/SiPS.2017.8110001	low-density parity-check code;throughput;real-time computing;latency (engineering);parallel computing;communications system;multi-core processor;x86;latency (engineering);decoding methods;computer science	Embedded	44.74422337145915	63.085328469939135	49870
5c90281e2494fddfb6ecc141ca54c26a88368425	on the performance of multi-tier heterogeneous networks under los and nlos transmissions		Heterogeneous networks (HetNets) with a multi-tier structure have been considered as a promising method to provide high quality of service to mobile users. The dense deployment of small-cell base stations (BSs) implies short distances between BSs and users. It is therefore likely that users will see line-of- sight (LoS) links from its serving BS and even nearby interfering BSs, which has not been considered in performance analysis for multi-tier HetNets yet. In this paper, we study a dense multi-tier HetNet with LoS and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) transmissions based on a multi-slope path loss model. The spatial locations of BSs of any given network tier and those of mobile users are modeled as independent spatial Poisson point processes (SPPPs). We derive the expression of downlink coverage probability for the multi-tier HetNet, based on which we calculate the area spectral efficiency (ASE) and energy efficiency (EE) of the HetNet. Our analytical results demonstrate that in an extremely dense HetNet, both the ASE and EE of the HetNet will drop quickly with further increase of the small-cell density due to the dominance of LoS interfering small-cell links.

In this paper, coherent optical pulse CDMA systems based on coherent correlation detection (CCD) through homodyne correlation detection (HCD) and self-HCD directly in the optical domain is proposed. With HCD, optical sequences from a pulsed laser, modulated by the data and encoded by an optical tapped delay-line encoder, are multiplexed in an optical fiber network. At the receiver, the optical code sequence of the intended user is locally generated. Through proper code and carrier phase synchronization, the local optical code is multiplied with the received signal chip by chip via an optical correlator consisting of a 3-dB coupler and a balanced detector. Thresholding is performed in the electrical domain after integration of the optical correlator output over one bit interval. The self-HCD approach utilizes two bipolar code sequences multiplexed alternately in time, obviating the need for the generation of a local code at the receiver. The received signal is divided at the receiver, decoded by two encoders (matched to those at the transmitters), and correlated via the optical correlator. The removal for the need of the local oscillator avoids the stringent implementation issues with HCD such as optical frequency stability and carrier phase noise. Following a description of the two implementations, system performances are theoretically analyzed and a comparison of the several approaches given.	acoustic coupler;charge-coupled device;code;coherent;cross-correlation;encoder;frequency drift;local oscillator;modulation;multiplexing;optical fiber;passive optical network;performance;phase noise;power dividers and directional couplers;thresholding (image processing);transmitter	Wei Huang;Ivan Andonovic	1999	IEEE Trans.

The relay channel is assumed to be symmetric in terms of number of antennas, i.e. the source and the destination have n antennas each, and the relay has m antennas. A general expression is derived for the DMT upper bound, which can be achieved by a compress-and-forward protocol at the relay, under certain assumptions. It is observed that the static half-duplex DMT matches the full-duplex DMT when the relay has a single antenna, and is strictly below the full-duplex DMT when the relay has multiple antennas.	duplex (telecommunications);mimo;multiplexing;relay	Olivier Lévêque;Christophe Vignat;Melda Yüksel	2009		10.1109/ISIT.2009.5205889	communications protocol;haar measure;telecommunications;information theory;antenna;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;relay channel;multiplexing;statistics;computer network;mimo	Networks	36.324472102175385	73.5149909116973	50007

A base station for downlink or broadcast transmission requires downlink channel state information (CSI), which is outdated in time-varying environments and we encounter degraded performance due to interference. One of the countermeasures against time-variant environments is predicting channels with an autoregressive (AR) model-based method. We modified the AR prediction for a time division duplex system. We conducted measurement campaigns in indoor environments to verify the performance of the scheme of channel prediction in an actual environment and measured channel data. We obtained the bit-error rate (BER) using these data. The AR-model-based technique of prediction assuming the Jakes’ model was found to reduce BER. Also, the optimum AR-model order was investigated by using the channel data we measured. key words: multi-user MIMO system, channel state information, timevarying environment, channel prediction, autoregressive (AR) model-based prediction	autoregressive model;bit error rate;channel state information;duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);mathematical model;multi-user mimo;telecommunications link;x.690	Yasutaka Ogawa;Kanako Yamaguchi;Huu Phu Bui;Toshihiko Nishimura;Takeo Ohgane	2013	IEICE Transactions		real-time computing;simulation;control theory;channel state information;precoding;statistics;mimo	Networks	42.305994715770154	83.05291073664102	50145

Specifically, we develop an optimal resource allocation algorithm that maximizes the long term average rate of the network while harvesting energy from both the received signal and the interference. We focus on receivers that split the received signal power into two streams; one is fed to an information decoding block and the other is fed to an energy harvester block. We use a weight perturbation Lyapunov approach to optimally schedule data admission and allocate the powers and the energy splitting factors. We show that the designed algorithm achieves O(1/K) of the optimal and requires O(K) data queue and battery size.	algorithm;interference (communication);lyapunov fractal;multi-user;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio	Ghada Saleh;Can Emre Koksal;Ness B.

Compared with local spectrum sensing with individual CR user, it can either reduce sensitivity requirements for each CR user or shorten the overall sensing duration. These advantages are from spatial diversity when all cooperative users sense a common primary user. However, in practice, CR users at different locations may receive signals from different primary users, which may confuse the fusion user and result in the loss of communication opportunities. In this paper, we propose a cooperative sensing approach by taking the reliability of each partner user into account. Simulation results illustrate significant performance improvement of the proposed approach.	cognitive radio;cooperative mimo;requirement;simulation	Guodong Zhao;Chenyang Yang;Geoffrey Ye Li;Dongdong Li;Anthony C.

c4210e9f36aa4a46764bdb8f1d0366cc4f28270a	markov process based array non-stationarity modeling for massive mimo channels		For the design and performance evaluation of potential massive multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) related algorithms, accurate channel models are indispensable. Spherical wavefront and array non-stationarity due to physically large antenna array are two new characteristics specific to massive MIMO propagation. In this paper, spherical wavefront effects can be well characterized by a predefined two-dimensional multi-confocal ellipse scattering geometry as in reference [1] and a 9- state Markov process is developed to capture the channel behaviors by array non-stationarity. Meanwhile, the associated approach to derive the state transition probabilities of the Markov process based on the outfield measurements is detailed. Finally, simulation results verify the validity of our proposal.	algorithm;committed information rate;computation;computational complexity theory;matlab;mimo;markov chain;open research;performance evaluation;simulation;software propagation;stationary process	Lihua Pang;Yang Zhang;Guangliang Ren;Feng-kui Gong;Anyi Wang;Jiandong Li	2017	2017 IEEE 86th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2017.8287887	computer science;electronic engineering;ellipse;antenna array;wavefront;mimo;markov process;scattering;communication channel	EDA	28.99764090929411	77.68716419773027	50198

The soft demodulator makes a soft decision on signal point level using a mean square (MS) estimator and can also exploit a priori knowledge about the source. Furthermore, we present a novel concept for unequal error protection (UEP) by higher order modulation with unequal power allocation (MUPA). Usually, the bits representing the quantized source codec parameters are protected by channel coding with UEP according to the individual bit error sensitivities. For communication systems where channel coding is not applicable, we propose the MUPA method with periodically time-varying power allocation. The average transmitted energy per bit remains unaffected. The significant SNR gains of the SDM combined with MUPA in comparison to systems with hard decision and a fixed signal constellation are demonstrated by simulation.	4-bit;acknowledgement (data networks);bit error rate;channel capacity;codec;estimation theory;forward error correction;mean squared error;modulation;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Thomas Brüggen;Christina Schulte-Hillen;Peter Vary	2005	Proceedings.

However, MMSE equalizer has a much higher complexity than RAKE receiver, especially when fading channel is spane in high chip rate cases and the length of the channel becomes very long, which prohibits its applications. Our purpose of the paper is to reduce the length of the channel efficiently and thus to reduce the computation complexity of MMSE equalizer. A new algorithm for the optimal shortening of channel impulse response for MMSE equalizers is proposed. This algorithm, which uses eigenvalues and eigenvectors to generate the globally optimal coefficients of Shortening Impulse Response Filter (SLRF), has a lower complexity than the previous ones.	adaptive equalizer;algorithm;coefficient;computation;equalization (communications);maxima and minima;rake;telecommunications link;uncompressed video;zermelo–fraenkel set theory	Yi Zhang;Jian Hua Gu;Dacheng Yang	2003		10.1109/ISSPA.2003.1224881	telecommunications;adaptive equalizer;computer science;control theory;mathematics;fading;global optimization	ML	47.84481125761116	77.27794805341298	50245

However, one of the main concerns to put through femtocells is the interference issue between macrocell and femtocell networks. In this paper, we consider femtocell uplink transmissions with dynamic interference from macrocell users. Without information exchange or subcarrier reallocation between femtocell and macrocell at any base station, we propose a precoded frequency division multiple access (P-FDMA) transmission with novel detectors to mitigate macrocell-to-femtocell uplink co-channel interference (MFU-CCI). It is shown that our design collects multipath diversity without estimating the interference channels and is robust to MFU-CCI.

Furthermore, low complexity pilot-aided methods are introduced for estimating channel parameters in an effort to study the resistance of the proposed solution to imperfect channel estimates. Simulation results show that benefits of MC-CDMA schemes, in terms of capacity and probability of error (P/sub e/), are enhanced by means of a selective parallel interference cancellation (S-PIC) receiver (at the expense of moderate increases in overall system complexity). The proposed channel estimation methods, based on a classical mean and a newly adaptive mean square error (AMSE) algorithm, introduce low performance loss, in terms of P/sub e/ and throughput, with respect to the ideal channel estimate situation. Moreover, the AMSE shows better accuracy and faster convergence than the mean algorithm.

To bypass the computational complexity required by the convex optimization, we derive a simple but near-optimal weighting vector.

We first investigate the power allocation with only a pair of relays under both the individual and global power constraints. To find the global optimum solution to this nonconvex problem, we develop a three-step approach using the rate-profiling technique together with a reformulation of the sum-rate maximization problem as a set of power-minimization geometric programming problems (GPPs). For reduced complexity, we further convert the optimization problem into a set of GPPs in a single-step by using a high signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio approximation. Next, we consider the relay pair selection and propose an algorithm in which the achievable rate of each pair of relays with the proposed power allocation is compared. This selection criterion outperforms the conventional selection scheme in terms of the achievable rate. We further propose two low-complexity selection criteria for low and moderate IRI. For moderate IRI, the ratio of the source-relay and relay-destination channel power product to the square of inter-relay channel power can be used for relay selection to achieve a performance close to that of the selection based on the proposed power allocation.	anisotropic filtering;approximation;catastrophic interference;eisenstein's criterion;expectation–maximization algorithm;geometric programming;global optimization;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;monomial;optimization problem;psi;relay channel;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio	Seong Hwan Kim;Tumula V.

One way to ensure a channel coherence time less than the symbol duration is by use of a carefully controlled oscillating-beam antenna array at the base station (BS). Here, beam pattern movement creates small coherence times. In this paper, with an oscillating-beam-pattern antenna array at the BS, the time varying channel is modeled to evaluate the channel coherence time and the available diversity in the MS. Here, a geometric-based stochastic channel model (GSCM) is used, and a circular coverage area is assumed. For a mid-sized city center, coherence times are shown to correspond to 1/7/sup th/ the symbol duration, suggesting a 7-fold time diversity is available at the MS when the BS's antenna array pattern is carefully controlled.	smart antenna	Seyed Alireza Zekavat;Carl R.

6165234b3b74d22a8fa60d79e4a2c9b8c3516352	spectral efficiency of massive mimo systems with multiple sub-arrays antenna		In this paper, we study the achievable spectral efficiency (SE) for multi-user massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems in a single cell, where the base station (BS) has the perfect channel state information and utilizes the maximum ratio transmission precoding. The channel model is built based on a finite dimensional mmWave channel by taking the azimuth angle into account and all users are assumed to have a random distribution in a circular-shaped cell. When the BS is deployed with a full uniform linear array (ULA) configuration, an analytical expression is derived by taking into account the expectation of the squared inner product between every two channel vectors that is viewed as inter-user interference. To effective suppress inter-user interference, we focus on studying the BS installing a multiple sub-arrays antenna configuration, in which all antennas are divided into three sub-ULA configurations to cover three regions of the cell, respectively. A closed-form expression on the inter-user interference is derived. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of full ULA and three sub-ULA configurations and derive approximated expressions on the achievable SE. Numerical results reveal that the achievable SE of system increases with the number of antennas, while it approaches saturation in the high-SNR regime. Interestingly, it is also found that three sub-ULA configurations are able to suppressive user interference and their achievable SE is superior to full ULA configuration, which has a great potential of mmWave massive MIMO systems.	approximation algorithm;channel (communications);channel state information;interference (communication);multi-user mimo;numerical method;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral efficiency	Weijie Tan;Xi'an Feng;Guiyun Liu;Weiqiang Tan;Mu Zhou;Chunguo Li	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2845666	mimo;channel state information;azimuth;precoding;distributed computing;topology;interference (wave propagation);computer science;base station;communication channel;spectral efficiency	Networks	29.789036274413007	83.93386304485723	50640
7a0277814cf23b1181b2c73a28dc33cda63dfbd2	joint feedback and artificial noise design for secure communications over fading channels without eavesdropper's csi		Secure communication with noisy feedback is studied in this correspondence. Unlike the majority of previous research efforts where the eavesdropperu0027s channel state information (CSI)—either instantaneous or statistical CSI, is known by the legitimate users, a joint feedback and artificial noise scheme without any eavesdropperu0027s CSI is proposed. The proposed scheme lets the source and the legitimate destination alternatively transmit private messages and degrade the eavesdropperu0027s channel quality in all transmission phases. An insightful discovery is that if the transmit power is lager than a certain threshold, a positive secrecy capacity can be achieved, which overcomes the problem that the secrecy cannot be achieved when the legitimate useru0027s CSI is worse than the eavesdropperu0027s. The secrecy capacity maximization problem is investigated by adaptive power allocation for the private signals and the artificial noise where a near optimal solution of the power of artificial noise is obtained under the high SNR situation. Finally, the numerical results verify the theoretical analysis and illustrate the secrecy performance of the proposed scheme.	channel state information;entropy maximization;feedback;numerical analysis;secure communication;signal-to-noise ratio	Hongliang He;Pinyi Ren;Qinghe Du;Hai Lin	2017	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2017.2729561	computer network;mimo;fading;transmitter power output;channel state information;electronic engineering;computer science;secure communication;artificial noise;signal-to-noise ratio;communication channel	Mobile	35.055630620354016	83.37366142140104	50657

This considered system consists of one power and information source, multiple power-constrained relays and one destination. In order to exploit the diversity advantage of cooperative network with low computational complexity, the relays apply the amplify-and-forward (AF) scheme to forward the received signal and the destination uses the selection combining (SC) scheme to receive the information. We derive the exact closed-form expressions of outage probability, throughput and average symbol error probability by using statistical characteristics of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Moreover, in order to understand the behavior of this system, we investigate the performance in various system parameters, such as energy harvesting time, relay number, and relay location. Finally, the correctness of the analytical results is confirmed by Monte-Carlo simulation.	computational complexity theory;correctness (computer science);downtime;information source;monte carlo method;network performance;numerical analysis;radio frequency;rayleigh fading;relay;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;sun outage;throughput	Dac-Binh Ha;Duc-Dung Tran;Duy-Hung Ha;Anh-Nhat Nguyen	2017	2017 International Conference on Information Networking (ICOIN)	10.1109/ICOIN.2017.7899510	communications protocol;throughput;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;signal-to-noise ratio;energy harvesting;computer network	HPC	36.10552326898637	78.86005631628994	50683

Here, an interference channel setting is considered where one transmitter (the “cognitive” one) knows the message of the other (“legitimate” user) partially. An outer bound on the capacity region of this channel is found for the “weak” interference case (where the interference from the cognitive transmitter to the legitimate receiver is weak). This outer bound is shown for both the discrete-memoryless and the Gaussian channel cases. An achievable region is subsequently determined for a Gaussian partially cognitive-radio channel. The achievable strategy described in this paper is a combination of superposition and dirty paper coding.	additive white gaussian noise;catastrophic interference;cognitive radio;interference (communication);transmitter	Goochul Chung;Sriram Sridharan;Sriram Vishwanath;Chan-Soo Hwang	2009	2009 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2009.5205698	random variable;transmitter;cognitive radio;telecommunications;information theory;computer science;mathematics;encoding;statistics	Arch	35.184961317846366	71.52826711670899	50699
