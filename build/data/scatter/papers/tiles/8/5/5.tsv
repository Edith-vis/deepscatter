For k, q ≥ 1, let c(k, q) be the number of conjugacy classes of words of length k on q letters. An unavoidable set of words of length k on q symbols has at least c(k, q) elements.

33f6f795b598ffaed31974a36eb12f29a397be7d	dyck paths skipping every fourth point: 11013		Solution by Marc Renault, Shippensburg University, Shippensburg, PA. It is well known that the number of Dyck n-paths is the Catalan number C, and that the Catalan numbers satisfy the recurrence relation Cn i= 1 Ci Cn--i. Let A = {(4k, 0): 1 u003c k u003c n 1}, let d2n be the number of Dyck (2n)-paths that avoid A, and let d be the number of Dyck (2n)-paths with at least one point in A. Clearly C2n = d2n + di,. A Dyck (2n)-path whose first point in A is (4k, 0) consists of a Dyck (2k)-path that avoids {(4j, 0): 1 u003c j i k 1} followed by a Dyck (2n 2k)-path. Thus, the number of Dyck (2n)-paths whose first point in A is (4k, 0) is d2 C2n-2k, and in total d, = =E l d2kC2n-2k. Noting that d2 = 2 = 2C1, we proceed by induction. With d2k = 2C2k-1 for 1 _ k u003c n 1, we have	dyck language	David Callan;Marc Renault	2005	The American Mathematical Monthly		combinatorics;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics	Theory	36.602496594557806	35.14958417262533	14538

In light of the experimental evidences and survey data, this paper develops generalized expressions for the reliability of array storage systems based on more realistic time to failure distributions such as Weibull. For instance, a distributed disk array system is considered in which the array components are disseminated across the network and are subject to independent failure rates. Based on such, generalized closed-form hazard rate expressions are derived. These expressions are extended to estimate the asymptotical reliability behavior of large-scale storage networks equipped with MDS parity-based protection. Unlike previous studies, a generic hazard rate function is assumed, a generic MDS code for parity generation is used, and an evaluation of the implications of adjustable redundancy level for an efficient distributed storage system is presented. Results of this paper are applicable to any erasure correction code as long as it is accompanied with a suitable structure and an appropriate encoding/decoding algorithm such that the MDS property is maintained.	algorithm;asymptote;clustered file system;computer data storage;disk array;mds matrix;regular expression;singleton bound	Suayb S.

For the first time, a method to evaluate the actual effective codeword weights for a given code, rather than a lower bound on effective codeword weights, is proposed. Based on these actual effective codeword weights, the performance of a given code with list decoding can be predicted more accurately. We propose an analytical method to evaluate the performance of a given code with list decoding and consider terminated convolutional codes to show the validity of the analysis.	application binary interface;approximation algorithm;binary-coded decimal;block code;brute-force search;code word;convolutional code;data-directed programming;digital back-propagation;electronic signature;emoticon;icl distributed array processor;linear code;list decoding;xfig	Chunlong Bai;Bartosz Mielczarek;Ivan J.

In this paper, we consider the QC NMDS codes by combining these two concepts. By choosing some elliptic curves with many rational points, we give a construction of QC NMDS codes based on the action of an elliptic curve automorphism on the rational points of the curve. Moreover, we calculate explicit example over finite fields of characteristic 2, 3, 5 or 7.	code	Hongxi Tong;Ding Yang	2013	Finite Fields and Their Applications	10.1016/j.ffa.2013.05.008	block code;reed–muller code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;linear code;mathematics;elliptic curve;group code;algebra	Crypto	41.05619574233586	52.99636410754469	15003

For example, Monte Carlo simulation-based power estimators tend to produce estimates for the average power consumption that corresponds only to the most probable power mode of the circuit. This can be a cause for trouble later in the design step. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, an algorithm is proposed that estimates the total number of power modes of a circuit based on simulated data. This is then followed by a maximum-likelihood estimation procedure that produces the average values of the power modes along with their probabilities of occurrence. Theoretical ideas are supported by experimental results for ISCAS '85 benchmark circuits and a large industrial circuit. The proposed method is shown to perform well by capturing the multiple power modes for both large and small circuits even when the number of simulated samples is small while the Monte Carlo estimator does not. We conclude with a note that the proposed method is also applicable to other model selection problems in VLSI.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);model selection;monte carlo method;random-access memory;simulation;very-large-scale integration	Ramamurti Chandramouli;Vamsi K.

While most power analysis approaches are based on the assumption of stationarity, artificial nonstationarity, or initial transient, may be introduced in early simulation period due to improper initialization. Left unattended, initial transient can seriously undermine the power estimation accuracy. As a remedy, we devise a statistical test for nonstationarity detection based on the Brownian bridge, the asymptotic behavior of a power dissipation sequence. Using the test, a stopping criterion is designed to determine if the circuit is warmed up enough for normal power analysis to proceed. The experimental results show the proposed technique efficiently detects and eliminates initial transients, thus maintaining power estimation accuracy.

Necessary and sufficient conditions for FSTDs with higher order null constraints at DC and at an arbitrary submultiple of the symbol frequency are derived. Analytical results are given concerning the performance of codes satisfying an Mth-order RDS constraint on partial-response channels.

In this article a new way of dynamically designing S-boxes using Latin Square doubly stochastic matrix is proposed. And it is demonstrated that the enciphering/deciphering process is a mimic of a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. Unlike conventional dynamic S-boxes, the proposed S-boxes are not directly defined by keys, but contained in the key dependent doubly stochastic matrix. The created matrix has desired properties including: 1) it implicitly contains S-boxes and thus complicates the internal structure of S-boxes; 2) it naturally defines S-boxes with reversibility and thus any S-boxes used for encryption can be directly used for decryption; 3) it satisfies the Strict Avalanche Criterion (SAC) for S-Boxes and thus it has good resistance to differential or linear cryptanalysis; 4) it guarantees the independence of the ciphertext distribution from plaintext one; and 5) it ensures that the expected ciphertext distribution is uniform and thus attains excellent confusion properties when use these S-Boxes iteratively. Theoretical and experimental results show that the proposed S-box has a high security level and is suitable to design cryptosystem for data encryption. We also extend our S-boxes to a simple image cipher. Experimental results show that the proposed dynamical flexible structure S-boxes has cryptographic properties comparable or better than some existing image encryption methods.	avalanche effect;bayesian information criterion;cipher;ciphertext;cryptosystem;doubly stochastic model;dynamical system;emoticon;encryption;linear cryptanalysis;markov chain monte carlo;monte carlo method;one-to-one (data model);plaintext;pseudorandomness;s-box;simulation;state transition table;stochastic matrix;turing completeness	Yue Wu;Joseph P.

In this paper, we propose a new way of measuring the effectiveness of different validation approaches based on automatic design error injection and simulation. This technique provides a systematic way for the evaluation of the quality of various validation approaches.

The technique presents a very low analog overhead and it is completely digital. For the System-on-Chip (SoC) environment, this allows the implementation of on-line test using processing power already present in the system. As all the signal processing is done in the digital domain, it allows use of a purely digital tester or a digital BIST technique. The main principle of operation is based on the observation of statistical properties of the circuit under test. Due to the low analog power and performance overhead, the proposed technique can be used to analyze the output of several stages of complex analog systems without the use of switches or analog multiplexors, as no additional AD converter is needed. This paper presents the fundamentals of the proposed test method and some preliminary results concerning linear analog systems.

We also use the generalized discrete Fourier transform to give the inverse formula for both the nonrepeated-root and repeated-root cases. Then we produce a formula which can be used to construct a QT code given the component codes.	discrete fourier transform;dual code;familial generalized lipodystrophy;photon correlation spectroscopy;polynomial;qt (software);ring device;twisted	Yan Jia	2012	Finite Fields and Their Applications	10.1016/j.ffa.2011.08.001	block code;reed–muller code;polynomial code;concatenated error correction code;prefix code;discrete mathematics;constant-weight code;low-density parity-check code;theoretical computer science;cyclic code;linear code;hamming code;expander code;mathematics;group code;reed–solomon error correction;algorithm	Vision	41.827008177905505	54.00935880543198	16562

Computer experiments suggest that the numbers appearing in a conjecture concerning the number of vertically symmetric alternating sign matrices with respect to the position of the first 1 in the second row of the matrix establish the solution of a linear equation system similar to the one for the ordinary refined ASM numbers. In this paper we show how our attempt to prove this fact naturally leads to a more general conjectural multivariate Laurent polynomial identity. Remarkably, in contrast to the ordinary refined ASM numbers, we need to extend the combinatorial interpretation of the numbers to parameters which are not contained in the combinatorial admissible domain. Some partial results towards proving the conjectured multivariate Laurent polynomial identity and additional motivation why to study it are presented as well.	experiment;laurent polynomial;linear equation;system of linear equations;the matrix	Ilse Fischer	2015	Electr.

The problem of existence of such a listing, which is called a cyclic Gray code of H, is known to be NP-complete in general. The goal of this paper is therefore to specify boundaries between its intractability and polynomial decidability. For that purpose, we consider a restriction when the vectors of H are of a bounded weight. A weight of a vector u ∈ {0, 1} is the number of 1’s in u. We show that if every vertex of H has weight k or k + 1, our problem is polynomial for k ≤ 1 and NP-complete for k ≥ 2. Furthermore, if k = 2 and for every i ∈ [n] there are at most m vectors of H of weight two having one in the i-th coordinate, then the problem becomes polynomial for m ≤ 3 and NP-complete for m ≥ 13. The following complementary problem is also known to be NP-hard: given an F ⊆ {0, 1}, which now plays the role of a set of faults to be avoided, is there a cyclic Gray code of {0, 1} \F? We show that if every vertex of F has weight at most k, the problem is polynomial for k ≤ 2 and NP-hard for k ≥ 5. It follows that there is a function f(n) = Θ(n) such that the existence of a cyclic Gray code of {0, 1} \ F for a given set F ⊆ {0, 1} of size at most f(n) is NP-hard. In addition, we study the cases when the Gray code does not have to be cyclic, and moreover, when the first and the last vectors of the code are prescribed. For these two modifications, all NP-hardness and NP-completeness results hold as well.	code;np-completeness;np-hardness;polynomial	Tomás Dvorák;Jirí Fink;Petr Gregor;Václav Koubek	2012	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.disc.2011.09.034	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;algorithm;algebra	Theory	36.45014701357882	40.589325591162655	16930

Let Pn := {gn | g ∈ R} and let μn := n ∏ p|n p. We show among other things that (i) for f ∈ R, f ∈ Pn ⇔ f (mod μn) ∈ Pn, and (ii) if f ∈ Pn, there is a unique g ∈ Pn with coefficients mod μn/n such that f ≡ g (mod μn). In particular, if f ≡ 1 (mod μn) then f ∈ Pn. The latter assertion implies that the theta series of any extremal even unimodular lattice in n (e.g. E8 in ) is in Pn if n is of the form 235 (i ≥ 3). There do not seem to be any exact analogues for codes, although we show that the weight enumerator of the rth order Reed-Muller code of length 2 is in P2r (and similarly that the theta series of the Barnes-Wall lattice BW2m is in P2m). We give a number of other results and conjectures, and establish a conjecture of Paul D. Hanna that there is a unique element f ∈ Pn (n ≥ 2) with coefficients restricted to the set {1, 2, . . . , n}.

They are oriented to fault detection in the converter stages rather than to measure the whole ADC electrical performance parameters. The operational principle of both strategies relies on testing every ADC stage reconfigured as an A/D-D/A block and applying as input a simple DC stimuli set which is easily obtained, without strong precision requirements, by a resistive network. The main differences between both strategies relate to the way the output response is evaluated. In the BIST#1 scheme, analog and digital outputs are compared with reference levels generated with a reference D/A converter and a counter. In the BIST # 2 strategy, only digital outputs are available and they are compared with fault-free values previously stored in an on-chip register. The new techniques are intended to be used in pipelined converters of an arbitrary number of conversion stages and with a digital self-correction mechanism.	analog signal;analog-to-digital converter;built-in self-test;comparator;counter (digital);digital data;digital-to-analog converter;fault detection and isolation;network analysis (electrical circuits);prototype;requirement;system under test;white-box testing;window function	Eduardo J.

The search limit k on the factors, which all have the form p = k · 2m + 1, was k = 109 for m ≤ 100 and k = 3 · 106 for 101 ≤ m ≤ 1000. Many larger primes of this form have also been tried as factors of Fn(a, b). Several thousand new factors were found, which are given in our tables.—For the smaller of the numbers, i.e. for n ≤ 15, or, if a, b ≤ 8, for n ≤ 16, the cofactors, after removal of the factors found, were subjected to primality tests, and if composite with n ≤ 11, searched for larger factors by using the ECM, and in some cases the MPQS, PPMPQS, or SNFS. As a result all numbers with n ≤ 7 are now completely factored. 1. Generalized Fermat numbers Generalized Fermat numbers (GFNs) of the form Fn(a) = a 2 + 1 have been studied earlier by one of us, see [3], [4]. The access to fast computers has recently rekindled interest in these numbers [1]. Many of the properties of this particular type of numbers also hold for the slightly more general type Fn(a, b) = a 2 + b n . For obvious reasons we shall assume that a and b are lacking common divisors. 2. Properties of the factors of GFNs The well-known theorem on the prime factors of the ordinary Fermat numbers 2 n + 1 is in the more general case replaced by the following result. Theorem 2.1. Suppose that p = k · 2 + 1|Fn(a, b), with k odd, and that u ≡ a/b mod p is a 2-power residue but not a 2-power residue mod p. Then m = n+ t+ 1.—If u is not even a quadratic residue, we have to put t = 0. Proof. We know that a n +b n ≡ b2n(u2n+1) ≡ 0 mod p. Since u ≡ x2t for some x, −1 ≡ u2n ≡ (x2t)2n = x2n+t mod p. Suppose that x mod p belongs to the exponent d = (p − 1)/l = k · 2/l. Then x ≡ −1 mod p, and d/2 is also the smallest positive exponent, yielding −1. Therefore d = 2, l = k · 2/d = k · 2m−n−t−1, and m ≥ n + t + 1. Since we have presumed that u is a 2-power residue, but not a 2-power residue, x is a quadratic non-residue, and thus x(p−1)/2 ≡ −1 mod p. Thus, (p−1)/2 must be an odd multiple of d/2 and thus l = (p−1)/d is odd, which implies that m− n− t− 1 = 0. Thus m is in this case exactly n+ t + 1.

In previous methods at least one type of transpositional error had to remain undetected. The key to this method lies in using the dihedral groups together with appropriate transformations in the important cases, where the numbers are represented in base 2r with r odd.		H.

This improvement is tight. We also compute the asymptotic behavior of symmetric Boolean functions and provide a formula that allows us to determine if a symmetric boolean function is asymptotically not balanced. In particular, when the degree of the symmetric function is a power of two, then the exponential sum is much smaller than 2n.	boolean algebra;coefficient;linear difference equation;power of two;recurrence relation;symmetric boolean function;time complexity	Francis N.

f2d9db2f68feeaeaa29e0bacd33e5505aa86fed0	test elements, retracts and automorphic orbits of free algebras	article	A nonzero element a of an algebra A is called a test element if for any endomorphism φ of A it follows from φ(a)=a that φ is an automorphism of the algebra A. A subalgebra B of A is a retract if there is an ideal I of A such that A=B ⊕ I. We consider the main types of free algebras with the Nielsen–Schreier property: free nonassociative algebras, free commutative and anti-commutative nonassociative algebras, free Lie algebras and superalgebras, and free Lie p-algebras and p-superalgebras. For any free algebra F of finite rank of such type we prove that an element u is a test element if and only if it does not belong to any proper retract of F. Test elements for monomorphisms of F are exactly elements that are not contained in proper free factors of F. These results give analogs of Turner's results on test elements of free groups. We also characterize retracts of the algebra F. We prove that if some endomorphism φ preserve the automorphic orbit of some nonzero element of F, then φ is a monomorphism. For free Lie algebras and superalgebras over a field of characteristic zero and for free Lie p-(super)algebras over a field of prime characteristic p we show that in this situation φ is an automorphism. We discuss some related topics and formulate open problems.		Alexander A.

Compared with the conventional FRC, the λ-FRC introduces a metric λ to evaluate the reliability of the messages passing through the circle. Codes with better performance can be obtained by selecting elements of the parity matrix according to the metric. Based on the λ-FRC, a greedy search algorithm is proposed to design the codes efficiently. In order to further improve the performance of the codes constructed, an iterative search algorithm is applied in the construction. Simulation results show that the performance of codes constructed by the λ-FRC methods outperforms those by the FRC methods, and the iterative search algorithm improves the performance of the codes as the iteration number increases1.	courant–friedrichs–lewy condition;frame rate control;greedy algorithm;iteration;low-density parity-check code;search algorithm;simulation;the circle (file system)	Tiantian Wang;Minjian Zhao;Yabo Li;Chen Zheng	2014	2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136291	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;error floor	Arch	42.69962120152498	60.42560153647029	18418

In addition, this tool can be used to visualize, explore and describe features of image regions of interest such as object edges or noise. For nearly fifty years, image processing, image analysis, and computer vision are fields that have been intensively studied. Many various mathematical theories and techniques have been widely involved in these scientific fields: linear algebra, continuous optimization, statistics, combinatorics, to name a few. One of the main problematics in image analysis is the foundation of formal modelings of the digital image. In any scientific field, an efficient modeling should establish structural relationships between the different objects of that domain. A digital image may be considered as a union of elementary spatial and colorimetric units. Therefore, working on the organization of these components may be seen as a combinatorial problem, since combinatorics is the science that studies organization of discrete objects in mathematically formalized modelings. This is maybe why graph theory and associated techniques arose in image analysis and had been widely used by many researchers. An attractive approach is to develop a modeling technique based on a generalized graph theory: hypergraph theory. Hypergraph theory arose from the seminal work of C. Berge in the early seventies [2]. In graph theory, one studies the binary relationships between elements. In hypergraph theory, the relationships between basics elements are generalized: elements in relation belong to a same set if they share a common property. We recently proposed a modeling based on hypergraph theory [6]. Our first intentions in dealing with this modeling was to try to characterize regions of interest in a picture. That is why we tried to represent the image neighborhood hypergraph structure itself and this paper presents some results on this. Trying A. Braquelaire, J.-O. Lachaud, and A. Vialard (Eds.): DGCI 2002, LNCS 2301, pp. 124–135, 2002. c © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002 Displaying Image Neighborhood Hypergraphs Line-Graphs 125 to represent it in a bidimensional way in simply drawing and coloring the hyperedges, we will show that this might appear as an unappropriate representation of that modeling. A tridimensional representation of the INH line-graph appeared to be a better way to display them and is the objet of our third part. 1 Theoretical Background Given a set X, we will denote by X(2) the set of unordered pairs of X. A graph G [1,13] is an ordered pair (X,E) such that E is a subset of X(2). The size of G is the cardinality of X. Elements of X are called vertices, those of E edges. If e = {x, y} is an edge of G, x and y are said to be adjacent. We say that a graph G′ = (X ′, E′) is a subgraph of a graph G = (X,E) if X ′ ⊂ X and E′ ⊂ E. A graph is said to be complete if E = X(2). A complete graph whose size is n will be denoted by Kn. A complete maximal (in the sense of inclusion) subgraph of a graph G is said to be a clique of G. A clique whose size is maximum is called a maximum clique [5]. To any vertex of a graph may be associated its neighborhood Γ (x) = {y ∈ X, {x, y} ∈ E}. The degree of a vertex x is the cardinality of the set Γ (x). If any vertex in the graph has the same degree, the graph is said to be regular. A hypergraph H [4] on a set X is an ordered pair (X,E) where E is a set of nonempty subsets of X such that ⋃ e∈E e = X. Elements of X are called vertices, those of E hyperedges. The size of a hypergraph is the cardinality of its set of vertices. The line-graph of a hypergraph is defined as the graph whose set of vertices are the hyperedges of the hypergraph and where there is an edge between two vertices if the associated hyperedges have a nonempty intersection. To any graph may be associated its neighborhood hypergraph defined by: ( X, ({x} ∪ Γ (x))x∈X ) . Moreover, we will say that the hyperedge {x} ∪ Γ (x) is generated by the vertex x and x will be called source pixel of {x} ∪ Γ (x). A digital image I [11] is a map from a subset X (generally finite) from ZZ in a subset C of ZZ. Elements of X are called points, those of C colors. A couple (x, I(x)) where x belongs to X is called a pixel. However, the confusion between a point x and (x, I(x)) is often made and we will not depart from it since it keeps its meaningfulness. A tiling (or a tessellation) of IR [19] is a partition of IR. The tilings generally studied are constrained by a limited number of geometric configurations called tessels. Given a tiling, the choice of an arbitrary point in the tessels, and the fact to link two points if the tessels share a common side allows to build a mesh. For the case of regular tilings where the tessels are regular polygons, the center of gravity of the polygon is often chosen and therefore leads to a regular mesh. In image processing, three types of meshes are used: hexagonal, triangular and square ones. Because of the current technological devices and the natural data structuring, the last type is the most used and we will therefore restrict our study to this kind of mesh. If a distance on ZZ defines a undirected, simple, loopless and regular graph on a mesh, that distance will be called a grid distance. A grid is then a nonempty set of ZZ with an associated grid distance. On square grids, two distance are mainly used: the city block (or 126 S. Chastel, P. Colantoni, and A. Bretto square) distance for which a given pixel has four neighbors and the chessboard (or diamond) distance for which a given pixel has eight ones. This paper will only deal with the chessboard distance. 2 Image Neighborhood Hypergraph Modeling 2.1 Spatiocolorimetric Neighborhood of a Pixel Let d be a distance on the set of colors C and d′ be a distance that defines a grid on X ⊂ ZZ. Let α and β be two strict positive reals. A unique neighborhood Γα,β(x) for the digital image I may be associated to any pixel x of X by: Γα,β(x) = {y ∈ X, y = x such as d (I(x), I(y)) < α and d′ (x, y) < β} We will call d′ grid distance and d colorimetric distance. The definition of colorimetric distances highly correlated with the perception of the human brain is always nowadays an extremely delicate domain of study of the neuroscientific field. However we will assume that such functions exist even if the ones we will use may not appear appropriate with our sensations at the sight of an image. Looking at the previous definition, it appears that the first part of it defines a neighborhood in the space C whereas the second one only involves the spatial domain. We will therefore respectively call α and β, colorimetric threshold and spatial threshold. Moreover we will qualify Γα,β(x) of spatiocolorimetric neighborhood. That notion allows to describe some consistency or homogeneity of a pixel with its environment. It is also interesting to see that such a neighborhood has a useful property: it increases in the sense of inclusion both with α and β. For instance, if we chose two colorimetric thresholds α and α′ such as α < α′, for a fixed β, Γα,β(x) ⊆ Γα′,β(x). That is due to the fact that if a pixel y is, from the color point of view, close of x at α, it remains close to x at α′. This argument is the same if we chose the spatial thresholds and it is possible to show it also for them. The main interest of that property is that it implies a certain regularity in the modeling that we will now present. 2.2 Image Neighborhood Hypergraph It is now possible to define an image neighborhood hypergraph (INH) Hα,β on X by Hα,β = ( X, ({x} ∪ Γα,β(x))x∈X ) . It is useful to precise that such a definition is correct since any hyperedge Γα,β(x) is nonempty: it contains at least the pixel x. Moreover the union of all the hyperedges is X itself. We will call Γα,β(x) hyperedge centered in (or generated by) the pixel x. As it directly inherits from the spatiocolorimetric neighborhood definition, an INH also increases with α and β in the sense of the hyperedges inclusion. The figure 1 shows a part of an INH and its associated line-graph for a spatial threshold β of 1 for the chessboard distance. For this figure we did not precise the colorimetric distance and its associated threshold as that is not relevant. However the first noticing is that displaying hypergraphs structures in this way leads to a muddled interlacing of patterns of various shapes and colors.

A number of combinatorial problems can be expressed as special cases of this general problem, with the observation that if t, = 1, N 1 or N then g, is a full cycle (on N symbols), a transposition or the identity, respectively. For example, the case t, = ... = t, = 1 relates to factorisations of 71 into products of full cycles, and this has been given by Stanley [S]. The case a = 2, t, = 1 is given in [ 1 ] and, when 71 is a fixed point free involution, this case has application to a topological question. The case a = 1 when n is the identity gives a generalisation of the classical result for the sums of the squares of the degrees of the irreducible (ordinary) representation of the symmetric group. We use, without further explanation, combinatorial and algebraic facts about the group algebra CS, of the symmetric group S, on N symbols over the field of complex numbers @. The facts are not given here but may be found in [ 11. Pertinent facts about Schur functions and the character theory of SN, however, are included here, in Section 2. The general result giving the generating function Ati(z,, . . . . z,) of cti(t,, . . . . t,) is given in Section 3.

Comparing with traditional methods, compressed sensing makes full use of sparsity so that a sparse signal can be reconstructed from very few measurements. A central problem in compressed sensing is the construction of sensing matrices. While random sensing matrices have been studied intensively, only a few deterministic constructions are known. Inspired by algebraic geometry codes, we introduce a new deterministic construction via algebraic curves over finite fields, which is a natural generalization of DeVore's construction using polynomials over finite fields. The diversity of algebraic curves provides numerous choices for sensing matrices. By choosing appropriate curves, we are able to construct binary sensing matrices which are superior to Devore's ones. We hope this connection between algebraic geometry and compressed sensing will provide a new point of view and stimulate further research in both areas.	algebraic equation;bch code;compressed sensing;cryptography;data acquisition;encryption;key (cryptography);linear algebra;point of view (computer hardware company);polynomial;sampling (signal processing);sparse matrix	Shuxing Li;Fei Gao;Gennian Ge;Shengyuan Zhang	2012	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2012.2196256	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;algebraic geometry;restricted isometry property;mathematics;geometry;elliptic curve	Theory	44.851735167371324	44.42409027425783	18722

Although different on-chip measurement solutions have been proposed for emission issue characterization, no on-chip measurement methods have been proposed to address the susceptibility issues. This paper presents an on-chip noise sensor dedicated to the study of circuit susceptibility to electromagnetic interferences. A demonstration of the sensor measurement performances and benefits is proposed through a study of the susceptibility of a digital core to conducted interferences. Sensor measurements ensure a better characterization of actual coupling of interferences within the circuit and a diagnosis of failure origins.	integrated circuit;mathematical optimization;multidisciplinary design optimization;performance;sensor	Sonia Bendhia;Alexandre Boyer;Bertrand Vrignon;Mikaël Deobarro;Thanh Vinh Dinh	2012	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2011.2172116	chip;system on a chip;electromagnetic interference;embedded system;electronic engineering;multidisciplinary design optimization;computer science;engineering;noise measurement;noise;electrical engineering;integrated circuit;attenuator;circuit design;regression model validation;cmos;electromagnetic compatibility;integrated circuit design	EDA	24.930377869355713	54.59572538841244	18734

In particular, we are interested in the distribution of their zeros, which are somehow dispersed over the whole domain Fq n . We show that if U is a “not too small” subspace of Fq n (as a vector space over the prime field Fp ), then the derived maps Fq /U −→ Fq , x + U 7−→ ∑ x̃∈x+U P (x̃) are constant and, in certain cases, not zero. Such observations lead to a refinement of Warning’s classical result about the number of simultaneous zeros x ∈ Fq n of systems P1, . . . , Pm ∈ Fq[X1, . . . , Xn] of polynomials over finite fields Fq . The simultaneous zeros are distributed over all elements of certain partitions (factor spaces) Fq /U of Fq n . |Fq /U | is then Warning’s well known lower bound for the number of these zeros. Introduction As described in the abstract, we will investigate the distributions of the different possible values of polynomial maps Fq n −→ Fq , x 7−→ P (x) . In particular, we are interested in the distribution of their zeros in the domain Fq . It turns out that they are somehow dispersed over the whole domain Fq , a property that strongly relies on the finiteness of the ground field Fq . The original goal behind this was to present a new sharpening (supplementation) of the following classical result, due to Chevalley and Warning, about the set of simultaneous zeros V := { x ∈ Fq n P1(x) = · · · = Pm(x) = 0 } of polynomials V P1, . . . , Pm ∈ Fq[X1, . . . , Xn] over finite fields Fq of characteristic p : m, n Fq , p the electronic journal of combinatorics 15 (2008), #R145 1 Theorem 0.1.

There are a lot of different sharpenings and supplementations, which follow two main streams.

This paper strengthens the urgency of this question by showing that if SIC-sets exist: (1) by a natural measure of orthonormality, they are as close to being an orthonormal basis for the space of density operators as possible; and (2) in prime dimensions, the standard construction for complete sets of mutually unbiased bases and Weyl-Heisenberg covariant SIC-sets are intimately related: The latter represent minimum uncertainty states for the former in the sense of Wootters and Sussman.

This is a Bose-type method derived from a particular type of 3-triangulations generated from non-sum-one-diierence-zero sequences (NS1D0 sequences). We introduce NS1D0 sequences and describe their basic properties; in particular we develop an equivalence between the problem of nding NS1D0 sequences and a variant of the n-queens problem. This equivalence , and an algebraic characterization of the NS1D0 sequences that produce anti-Pasch Steiner triple systems, form the basis of our algorithm.	algorithm;linear algebra;steiner tree problem;turing completeness	Feliu Sagols;Charles J.

In this paper a novel approach to model the power losses of Insulate Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBT) in Induction Cooking (IC) application is proposed. The inherent lack of precise physical IGBT loss model and the uncertainty of load in IC application has stimulated the idea to identify system-level behavioral power loss models that allow to cover a variety of devices and load conditions. For this goal, a Genetic Programming approach has been adopted, that starts from measured electrical quantities and returns a set of models, each one with the same structure but with different parameters relevant to the device under test. The models generated by the proposed method based on a training set of case studies have been merged into a generalized model and verified through a validation set.	algorithm;coefficient;device under test;genetic programming;insulated-gate bipolar transistor;mathematical induction;mathematical optimization;power electronics;semiconductor device;test set	Nicola Femia;Mario Migliaro;Antonio Della Cioppa	2016	2016 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)	10.1109/CEC.2016.7744391	semiconductor device modeling;computer science;machine learning;predictive modelling	EDA	24.854926445923336	58.846050410189	19370

These systems always detect all single errors (i.e. errors in only one component of a code word) and can detect some other errors arising during transmission of data. We study check character systems over T-quasigroups. These quasigroups are isotopic to abelian groups and generalize the well-known class of medial quasigroups. We establish some properties of a T-quasigroup so that the check character systems over it are able to detect transpositions, jump transpositions, twin errors and jump twin errors. We also give some models of T-quasigroups, which satisfy all of the required properties for detection of errors of each of the considered types.	check digit;pl/i	G. B. Belyavskaya;V. I.

ebc3e65ab963cf673b342d4da681c14597a228bc	using sparse interpolation in hensel lifting		The standard approach to factor a multivariate polynomial in Z[x1, x2, . . . , xn] is to factor a univariate image in Z[x1] then lift the factors of the image one variable at a time using Hensel lifting to recover the multivariate factors. At each step one must solve a multivariate polynomial Diophantine equation. For polynomials in many variables with many terms we find that solving these multivariate Diophantine equations dominates the factorization time. In this paper we explore the use of sparse interpolation methods, originally introduced by Zippel, to speed this up. We present experimental results in Maple showing that we are able to dramatically speed this up and thereby achieve a good improvement for multivariate polynomial factorization.	algorithm;experiment;factorization of polynomials;interpolation;lambda lifting;lifting scheme;like button;maple;polynomial;schwartz–zippel lemma;sparse matrix	Michael B.

More recently, Krattenthaler and Prohaska (Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 351 (1999) 1015) have proved a ‘remarkable formula’, conjectured by Conca and Herzog (Adv.

We describe here an explicit, albeit complicated, formula for the Hilbert function and the Hilbert series in the case of arbitrary sized minors in two-sided ladders.

1d6431655d6b295f256516383a75011a00b4c2d8	efficient algorithms for order basis computation	pade approximation;order basis;module basis	In this paper we present two algorithms for the computation of a shifted order basis of an m×n matrix of power series over a field K with m ≤ n. For a given order σ and balanced shift ~s the first algorithm determines an order basis with a cost of O∼(nωdmσ/ne) field operations in K, where ω is the exponent of matrix multiplication. Here an input shift is balanced when max(~s)−min(~s) ∈ O(mσ/n). This extends earlier work of Storjohann which only determines a subset of an order basis that is within a specified degree bound δ using O∼(nωδ) field operations for δ ≥ dmσ/ne. While the first algorithm addresses the case when the column degrees of a complete order basis are unbalanced given a balanced input shift, it is not efficient in the case when an unbalanced shift results in the row degrees also becoming unbalanced. We present a second algorithm which balances the high degree rows and computes an order basis also using O∼(nωdmσ/ne) field operations in the case that the shift is unbalanced but satisfies the condition ∑n i=1(max(~s)−~si) ≤ mσ. This condition essentially allows us to locate those high degree rows that need to be balanced. This extends the earlier work by the authors from ISSAC’09.	algorithm;balanced audio;computation;matrix multiplication;unbalanced circuit	Wei Zhou;George Labahn	2012	J. Symb.

Furthermore, serial data transfer implemented using a few wiring lines is also required. Therefore, a CDMA serial communication interface with a new two-step synchronization technique is proposed to counter these problems. The transmitter and receiver fabricated by 0.25 μm digital CMOS technology achieve 2.7 Gcps (gigachips per second) and can multiplex 7 communication channels.	multiply–accumulate operation;serial communication	Mitsuru Shiozaki;Toru Mukai;Masahiro Ono;Mamoru Sasaki;Atsushi Iwata	2005	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietele/e88-c.6.1233	embedded system;synchronization;code division multiple access;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;control system;robotics;multiplexing;intelligent control	Visualization	51.145939246101015	50.99389369167148	20432

The design methodology described herein retains practical advantages of array LDPC codes such as excellent performance and efficient encodability across all the codes in a rate-compatible family. Different codes in the rate-compatible family can be specified by a small number of parameters and constructed algebraically with a small amount of preprocessing. The rate-compatible codes can be decoded using a generic decoder architecture, leading to efficient implementations. These properties make the codes attractive for use in DSL systems that need to support a large number of code parameters to cope with channel variability.	low-density parity-check code	Ajay Dholakia;Sedat Ölçer	2004		10.1109/ICC.2004.1312522	block code;reed–muller code;concatenated error correction code;turbo code;low-density parity-check code;online codes;digital subscriber line;fountain code;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;tornado code;linear code;hamming code;expander code;luby transform code;forward error correction;raptor code;error floor;reed–solomon error correction;statistics	Theory	42.67113246221493	60.347459373844266	20481

For secret sharing scheme based on linear block codes, the amount of information leaked to adversaries has not been investigated. Hence, in existing constructions of secret sharing scheme based on arbitrary linear codes, some elements of a secret vector S = [s1, …, sl] might leak out deterministically from a non-qualified set. In this paper, we first define anti-access set J as a special non-qualified set. For J, no information about every (t + 1)-tuple of s1, …, sl leaks out from any subset of J with cardinality│J│-t. We also introduce the conditions of a linear code and its dual code such that a specified set becomes an anti-access set in secret sharing scheme using the code. Then, we propose a secret sharing scheme based on a linear code C. The proposed secret sharing scheme realizes a similar access structure to threshold access structures, and every non-qualified set whose cardinality is less than or equal to α are anti-access sets. Further, we show that the proposed scheme can be completely characterized by the generalized Hamming weight of C┴.	access structure;dual code;hamming weight;linear code;shamir's secret sharing;window function	Jun Kurihara;Tomohiko Uyematsu	2011	2011 49th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)	10.1109/Allerton.2011.6120269	block code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;hamming distance;hamming bound;theoretical computer science;cyclic code;shamir's secret sharing;hamming graph;linear code;hamming code;mathematics;homomorphic secret sharing;secure multi-party computation;forward error correction;hamming(7,4);secret sharing;verifiable secret sharing	Crypto	38.25532745387975	55.10176178301317	20507

We show that every group is the full automorphism group of an unordered k-relation for given k 2 2 on some suitable set. We are also concerned with the cardinality of a minimal representation with this property as a function of k. A permutation group (G, 52) on a finite or infinite set 52 acts k-geometrically if there is a system B of k-element subsets of Q-called blocks such that a permutation of Q belongs to G if and only if it maps blocks onto blocks. In other words: (G, Sz) is the full automorphism group of the unordered k-relation 99. In this note we generalize an old theorem of Frucht [3] about the representability of an abstract group as the full automorphism group of a graph. Theorem 1. Let G be a group and k > 2 an integer. Then there is a faithful permutation representation of G on some set 52 such that (G,Q) acts k-geometrically. When G is a finite group let the kth Frucht numberfk(G) of G be the cardinality of a minimal set R on which G can be represented faithfully as a k-geometric permutation group.

Such approach uses transformation functions implemented as look-up tables in order to allow the transformation of uniformly distributed noise into noise signals having other probability density functions. A special case study is presented, where a non-linear lookup addressing scheme is proposed to minimize the error in the case of a transformation function with poles, as it is the case of the transformation from uniform to normal distribution.	addressing scheme;application domain;flat memory model;lookup table;noise generator;nonlinear system;reconfigurable computing;requirement	Élvio Dutra;Leandro Soares Indrusiak;Manfred Glesner	2005	2005 18th Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design	10.1145/1081081.1081141	electronic engineering;lookup table;computer science;theoretical computer science;algorithm;statistics	EDA	28.299248225820754	51.58838864949241	20547

A large block length lossless turbo source encoder offers compression rates close to the source entropy but with large latency. In this letter, we propose a lossless compression technique for binary memoryless sources using short block length turbo codes. To achieve compression rates close to the source entropy, we modify different components of the encoder. We focus on the design of the parity interleaver for different compression rates. Also, we replace the square shape puncturing array with a rectangular shape array that allows finer puncturing and hence improved compression rates. Finally, instead of a single code, we employ many codes operating in parallel. Given these modifications, we evaluate the encoding complexity of the proposed code	block code;data compression;encoder;forward error correction;lossless compression;parity bit;pseudorandomness;puncturing;triple modular redundancy;turbo code	Javad Haghighat;Walaa Hamouda;M.

The radiofrequency (RF) microelectromechanical system (MEMS) technology offers the potential of large reduction in mass and volume of electronic equipment, by replacing the waveguide and coaxial switch matrices with their MEMS counterparts. Mass reductions can be also exploited to increase the satellite system capacity (by adding payload electronics) or to extend operational life (by increasing station keeping fuel). As a result, market factors have constantly been pushing hardware suppliers to reduce mass and size of their space-based products.	channel capacity;microelectromechanical systems;radio frequency	R.

The architecture is very regular and hence very suitable for standard-cell implementation flow. Due to its feedforward architecture, the required bit-rate can be achieved through proper pipelining. These properties make the proposed architecture very suitable as soft silicon intellectual property. Analysis of BER due to the combined effects of the key design parameters like data jitter, clock jitter and oversampling ratio in the oversampling technique are carried out. Thus different specifications of data recovery can be designed with different design parameters. A module generator that can estimate the design parameters automatically is established. Design implementation shows the proposed all-digital data recovery circuit can achieve 3.07 Gbit/s (post-layout) with 0.25 mm 2.5 V CMOS technology standard-cell design and occupies 380 390 mm chip area.	cmos;data recovery;digital data;feedforward neural network;gigabit;oversampling;performance evaluation;pipeline (computing);standard cell;x.690	Shyh-Jye Jou;Chih-Hsien Lin;Yen-Hung Chen;Zheng-Hong Li	2007	IET Circuits, Devices & Systems	10.1049/iet-cds:20045173	embedded system;electronic engineering;real-time computing;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;engineering	EDA	29.798252460664415	55.642893214999745	21067

Yet fundamental issues such as the theory of existence and the practice of computation remain open. Recently it has been proved that, given an arbitrary (n − 1)-tuple L = (λ2, . . . , λn) ∈ Cn−1 whose components are closed under complex conjugation, there exists a unique positive real number R(L), called the minimal realizable spectral radius of L, such that the set {λ1, . . . , λn} is precisely the spectrum of a certain n×n nonnegative matrix with λ1 as its spectral radius if and only if λ1 ≥ R(L). Employing any existing necessary conditions as a mode of checking criteria, this paper proposes a simple bisection procedure to approximate the location of R(L). As an immediate application, it offers a quick numerical way to check whether a given n-tuple could be the spectrum of a certain nonnegative matrix.

To verify our architecture, an area-efficient LDPC decoder that supports both China Multimedia Mobile Broadcasting (CMMB) and Digital Terrestrial/ Television Multimedia Broadcasting (DTMB) standards is developed. A solution is proposed to avoid memory access conflict problem caused by TDMP algorithm. The main timing schedule is arranged carefully to handle the operations of our solution while avoiding much additional hardware consumption. We also optimize the extrinsic message storing strategy to reduce the memory bits needed. Besides the extrinsic message recover and the accumulate operation are merged together. Based on SMIC 0.13 um standard CMOS process, the core area of the decoder is only 4.75 mm2 and the maximum operating clock frequency is 200 MHz. With 5 iterations, the estimated average power consumption is 48.4 mW at 25 MHz for CMMB and 130.9 mW at 50 MHz for DTMB with 1.2V supply.	accumulator (computing);algorithm;cmos;clock rate;core (optical fiber);iteration;low-density parity-check code;unified model;very-large-scale integration	Changsheng Zhou;Yunlong Ge;Xubin Chen;Yun Chen;Xiaoyang Zeng	2011	ASAP 2011 - 22nd IEEE International Conference on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors	10.1109/ASAP.2011.6043258	embedded system;parallel computing;real-time computing;low-density parity-check code;iteration;index term;telecommunications;schedule;computer science;delta-sigma modulation;conflict resolution;cmos;statistics	EDA	31.59949260089609	53.71231077482806	21501

Split a file into n pieces so that it can be restored without any m parts (1<=m<=n). Such problems are called problems secret sharing. There exists a set of methods for solving such problems, but they all require a fairly large number of calculations applied to the problem posed above. The proposed method does not require calculations, and requires only the operations of the division of the file into equal (nearly equal) parts and gluing them in a certain order in one or more files.	secret sharing	Oleg Titov	2010	CoRR		data structure;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;programming language;secret sharing;algorithm	Robotics	35.1457072576703	51.501778221204106	21740
5d4b2b96c7b9ca3174cfca4c79092a0dc9164c8d	on a low-rate tldpc code ensemble and the necessary condition on the linear minimum distance for sparse-graph codes		This paper addresses the issue of design of low-rate sparse-graph codes with linear minimum distance in the blocklength. First, we define a necessary condition which needs to be satisfied when the linear minimum distance is to be ensured. The condition is formulated in terms of degree-1 and degree-2 variable nodes and of low-weight codewords of the underlying code, and it generalizies results known for turbo codes [8] and LDPC codes. Then, we present a new ensemble of low-rate codes, which itself is a subclass of TLDPC codes [4], [5], and which is designed under this necessary condition. The asymptotic analysis of the ensemble shows that its iterative threshold is situated close to the Shannon limit. In addition to the linear minimum distance property, it has a simple structure and enjoys a low decoding complexity and a fast convergence.	sparse graph code	Iryna Andriyanova;Jean-Pierre Tillich	2010	CoRR		block code;reed–muller code;concatenated error correction code;turbo code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;low-density parity-check code;theoretical computer science;linear code;hamming code;expander code;mathematics;error floor;reed–solomon error correction	Robotics	39.96060813003884	57.915162451269296	21895
c8190f9f4ff9765b2ac9b6856c4ea0aa8e539a66	fields of definition of building blocks	abelian variety;building block;modular curve;galois cohomology;point of view	We investigate the fields of definition up to isogeny of the abelian varieties known as building blocks. These varieties are defined as the Q-varieties admitting real or quaternionic multiplications of the maximal possible degree allowed by their dimensions (cf. Pyle (2004)). The Shimura-Taniyama conjecture predicts that every such variety is isogenous to a non-CM simple factor of a modular Jacobian J1(N). The obstruction to descend the field of definition of a building block up to isogeny is given by Ribet in 1994 as an element in a Galois cohomology group. In this paper we begin by studying these elements from an abstract Galois-cohomological point of view, and obtain results and formulas for the computation of invariants related to them. When considered for the element attached to a building block, these invariants give the structure of its endomorphism algebra, and also complete information on the possible fields of definition up to isogeny of this building block. We implemented these computations in Magma for building blocks given as Q-simple factors up to isogeny of the Jacobian of the modular curve X1(N). Using this implementation we computed a table for conductors N ≤ 500, which is described in the last section. This table is a source of examples of building blocks with different behaviors and of statistical information; in particular, it contains many examples that answer a question posed by Ribet in 1994 on the existence of a smallest field of definition up to isogeny for RM-building blocks	computation;invariant (computer science);jacobian matrix and determinant;mv-algebra;magma;maximal set;robertson–seymour theorem	Jordi Quer	2009	Math.

44d6f7ff248c652a7522aaf85a25ed8ddaf077bb	random walk in a n-cube without hamiltonian cycle to chaotic pseudorandom number generation: theoretical and practical considerations		Designing a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) is a difficult and complex task. Many recent works have considered chaotic functions as the basis of built PRNGs: the quality of the output would indeed be an obvious consequence of some chaos properties. However, there is no direct reasoning that goes from chaotic functions to uniform distribution of the output. Moreover, embedding such kind of functions into a PRNG does not necessarily allow to get a chaotic output, which could be required for simulating some chaotic behaviors. In a previous work, some of the authors have proposed the idea of walking into a N-cube where a balanced Hamiltonian cycle has been removed as the basis of a chaotic PRNG. In this article, all the difficult issues observed in the previous work have been tackled. The chaotic behavior of the whole PRNG is proven. The construction of the balanced Hamiltonian cycle is theoretically and practically solved. An upper bound of the expected length of the walk to obtain a uniform distribution is calculated. Finally practical experiments show that the generators successfully pass the classical statistical tests.	chaos theory;dynamical system;embedded system;experiment;hamiltonian path;iterated function;iteration;pseudorandom number generator;simulation;strongly connected component;supercomputer	Sylvain Contassot-Vivier;Jean-François Couchot;Christophe Guyeux;Pierre-Cyrille Héam	2017	I.

The method is extended here to produce a 1-arc-transitive bipartite graph in a 'free' way, starting with any partial order with greatest and least element and with instructions on its points about how they will ramify in the extension. A key feature of our work is the interplay between properties of the initial partial order, the extended partial order, and the bipartite graph which results. We also extend the earlier work by giving a complete characterization of all 2-CS-transitive cycle-free partial orders. In addition, we discuss the completeness of the constructed partial orders, in the sense of Dedekind and MacNeille, and remark that the bipartite graph constructed can only be 2-arc-transitive in the cycle-free case.

A http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sysarc.2012.08.003 q This paper is an extended version of a conference ⇑ Corresponding author. E-mail address: xwang@ece.osu.edu (X. Wang). Information dissemination is of increasing importance to our society. Existing work mainly focuses on delivering information from sources to sinks in a timely manner based on established subscriptions, with the assumption that those subscriptions are persistent. However, the bottleneck of many information dissemination systems is actually the matching process to continuously reevaluate such subscriptions between numerous sources and numerous sinks, in response to dynamically varying information attributes at runtime. In this paper, we propose an adaptive control architecture to meet the response time constraints on metadata matching in an example information dissemination system. Our adaptive controller features a rigorous design based on well-established control theory for guaranteed control accuracy and system stability. Furthermore, our controller can adapt to changes in the system model without reconfiguration and profiling. Empirical results on a physical testbed demonstrate that our controller has more accurate control and improved system quality of service than both an open-loop solution and a typical heuristic solution. 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The output sequences of these simple devices may be described using arithmetic in a ramified extension field of the rational numbers. In this paper we show how many of these sequences may also be described using simple integer arithmetic, and consequently how to find such sequences with large periods. We also analyze the ‘‘arithmetic crosscorrelation’’ between pairs of these sequences and show that it often vanishes identically.	algorithm;clock signal;cross-correlation;feedback with carry shift registers;finite-state machine;integer (computer science);linear-feedback shift register;quasiperiodicity	Mark Goresky;Andrew Klapper	2004	Des.

Here we consider the fourth type, namely [3 3], which we show to be equivalent to a class of designs which we call strongly regular of the second kind (srd2's). The 'group case' means that the existence of two inequivalent permutation representations affording the same character. In sections 2 and 3 we define srd2's, establish equivalence with cc's of the indicated type, and list the parameter conditions which are a consequence of this. The examples that we know are listed in Section 4. Section 5 contains a characterization of one of the known families and a non-existence result, and the final Section 6 contains some remarks about polarities of srd2's. Table 1 of Section 5 is a list of feasible parameters for srd2's with at most 300 points such that the point and block graphs are primitive, together with the known information about existence. Cayley [1] was used for explicit examination of examples and the Atlas [2] provided group-theoretic information required for some of the examples.	boolean algebra;coherence (physics);magma;strongly regular graph;theory;turing completeness	D.

A binary positional number system (binary radix system) with base equal the golden ratio (1 + √ 5)/2 is fairly well known. The main result of this paper is a construction of infinitely many binary radix systems, each one constructed combinatorially from a single pair of binary strings. Every binary radix system that satisfies even a minimal set of conditions that would be expected of a positional number system, can be constructed in this way.

If each definition of fundamental properties of a graph is defined in terms of these incidence matrices, the theories of matrices and Markov-chains can be applied directly to graph theory. It is the purpose of this paper to give the definitions of some graph theoretic concepts in terms of the edge-edge incidence matrix and to point out the advantages of such an approach.	graph theory;incidence matrix;markov chain	Yoshiko Takenaka	1970	Information and Control	10.1016/S0019-9958(70)90501-2	graph energy;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;directed graph;degree matrix;laplacian matrix;null graph;computer science;graph theory;mathematics;voltage graph;incidence matrix;rank;spectral graph theory;incidence geometry;integer matrix;adjacency matrix;algebra	Theory	33.04201578320526	32.948200876545926	23750

We first present a necessary and sufficient condition for a finite set of orthogonal quantum states to be distinguishable by separable operations. An analytical version of this condition is derived for the case of (D-1) pure states, where D is the total dimension of the state space under consideration. A number of interesting consequences of this result are then carefully investigated. Remarkably, we show there exists a large class of 2 otimes 2 separable operations not being realizable by local operations and classical communication. Before our work, only a class of 3 otimes 3 nonlocal separable operations was known [Bennett , Phys. Rev. A 59, 1070 (1999)]. We also show that any basis of the orthogonal complement of a multipartite pure state is indistinguishable by separable operations if and only if this state cannot be a superposition of one or two orthogonal product states, i.e., has an orthogonal Schmidt number not less than three, thus generalize the recent work about indistinguishable bipartite subspaces [Watrous, Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 080505 (2005)]. Notably, we obtain an explicit construction of indistinguishable subspaces of dimension 7 (or 6) by considering a composite quantum system consisting of two qutrits (resp., three qubits), which is slightly better than the previously known indistinguishable bipartite subspace with dimension 8.	emoticon;information processing letters;locc;nonlocal lagrangian;quantum state;quantum system;qubit;schmidt decomposition;state space	Runyao Duan;Yuan Feng;Yu Xin;Mingsheng Ying	2009	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2008.2011524	separable state;quantum information;index term;quantum nonlocality;information theory;state space;pure mathematics;mathematics;quantum computer	Theory	38.571668887682776	46.27854227122769	23875

It is therefore important to know the amount of noise at a certain point on the substrate. Existing transistor-level simulation approaches based on a substrate model extracted from layout information are not feasible for digital circuits of practical size. This paper presents a complete high-level methodology, which simulates a large digital standard cell-based design using a network of substrate macromodels, with one macromodel for each standard cell. Such macromodels can be constructed for both EPI-type and bulk-type substrates. Comparison of our substrate waveform analysis (SWAN) to several measurements and to several full SPICE simulations indicates that the substrate noise is simulated with our methodology within 10%-20% error in the time domain and within 2 dB relative error at the major resonance in the frequency domain. However, it is several orders of magnitude faster in CPU time than a full SPICE simulation.	analogue electronics;approximation error;audio signal processing;central processing unit;digital electronics;embedded system;high- and low-level;logic synthesis;macromodel;mixed-signal integrated circuit;resonance;rise time;spice;simulation;standard cell;substrate (electronics);transistor	Mustafa Badaroglu;Geert Van der Plas;Piet Wambacq;Stéphane Donnay;Georges G.

Furthermore, it was found that both of the non-abelian groups of order 8 possessed exactly 128 near-complete mappings. These surprising results motivated an investigation into why this was the case. In the present paper we show why both of the non-abelian groups of order 8 possess the same number of complete and near-complete mappings. It is also shown why both of the non-cyclic abelian groups of order 8 possess the same number of complete mappings.	magma	David Bedford	1991	Eur. J.

f3aa6388d567842f5830b2cf21454fbed2db5b55	discovering linear-recurrent solutions to hofstadter-like recurrences using symbolic computation		Abstract The Hofstadter Q -sequence, with its simple definition, has defied all attempts at analyzing its behavior. Defined by a simple nested recurrence and an initial condition, the sequence looks approximately linear, though with a lot of noise. But, it is unknown whether the sequence is even infinite. In the years since Hofstadter published his sequence, various people have found variants with predictable behavior. Commonly, the variant sequences eventually satisfy linear recurrences. Proofs of such behaviors are inductive and highly automatable. This suggests that a search for more sequences like these may be fruitful. In this paper, we develop an algorithm to search for these sequences. Using this algorithm, we determine that such sequences come in infinite families that are themselves plentiful. In fact, there are hundreds of easy to describe families based on the Hofstadter Q -recurrence alone.	recurrence relation;symbolic computation	Nathan Fox	2018	J. Symb.

The system uses experimental data obtained from dual channel synchronous sampling to estimate Q factor. The estimation model is simple and does not involve complicated data processing nor manual data range optimization. The model accuracy has been validated by experimental measurements and further corrected for sampling errors. The results show that the model has very good correlation to the measured Q and thus can be used to detect degradation in the optical signal.

This average value differs somewhat from what earlier was reported (Gutman et al., 1990. Chem. Phys. Lett. 173, 403). The origin of this difference is clarified. A remarkable collective property is established for the chains possessing no linearly annelated hexagons: the sum of their Wiener indices is divisible by the number of chains.	wiener index	Andrey A.

By constructing the corresponding displacement of the matrices, we derive the formulas on representation of the inverses of the CUPL Toeplitz matrices in the form of sums of products of factor (1, 1)-circulants and   (−1,−1)      (  −  1  ,  −  1  )        -circulants. Furthermore, through the relation between the CUPL Toeplitz matrices and the CUPL Hankel matrices, the inverses of the CUPL Hankel matrices can be obtained as well.	inversion (discrete mathematics)	Xiaoyu Jiang;Kicheon Hong	2017	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2017.03.024	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;toeplitz matrix;mathematics;algebra	AI	42.93356573917962	35.85519260695205	25186

Since each partition corresponds directly to a monotone formula for the associated quadratic function we obtain an upper bound for the monotone formula size of quadratic functions. Our method extends to uniform hypergraphs with fixed range and thus to homogeneous functions with fixed length of prime implicants. Finally we give an example of a quadratic function where each monotone formula built from arbitrary partitions of the graph (double edges allowed) is not optimal. That means we disprove the single-level-conjecture for formulae.	multi-level cell;quadratic function;monotone	Siegfried Bublitz	1986	Acta Informatica	10.1007/BF00264314	partition;quadratic equation;implicant;complete bipartite graph;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;complexity;strongly monotone;topology;bipartite graph;monotonic function;mathematics;boolean function;graph;upper and lower bounds;algorithm	Theory	25.398905381442617	32.56494070159849	25235

A PA A has pairwise Hamming distance at least d, if for every pair of permutations \(\sigma \) and \(\tau \) in A, there are at least d integers i in \(Z_n\) such that \(\sigma (i)\ne \tau (i)\). Let M(n, d) denote the maximum number of permutations in any PA with pairwise Hamming distance at least d. Recently considerable effort has been devoted to improving known lower bounds for M(n, d) for all \(n>d>3\). We give a partition and extension operation that enables the production of a new PA \(A'\) for \(M(n+1,d)\) from an existing PA A for \(M(n,d-1)\). In particular, this operation allows for improvements for PA’s for \(M(q+1,q)\) for powers of prime numbers q, as well as for many other choices of n and d, where n is not a power of a prime. Finally, for prime numbers p, the partition and extension technique provides an asymptotically better lower bound for \(M(p+1,p)\) than that given by current knowledge about mutually orthogonal Latin squares. We prove a new asymptotic lower bound for the set of primes p, namely, \(M(p+1,p)\ge p^{1.5}/2-O(p)\).		Sergey Bereg;Linda Morales;Ivan Hal Sudborough	2017	Des.

a66ad42a46080246599a94da006e492dc46c2324	a direct construction of inter-group complementary code set		Complete complementary codes (CCCs) is a collection of mutually orthogonal complementary codes and Inter-group complementary (IGC) code set consists of multiple disjoint groups of 2-D codes. IGC code set has large set size than CCC and both can be applicable in multicarrier code-division multiple access. The aperiodic autocorrelation function sidelobes of any IGC code is zero for all time shifts inside the zero-correlation zone (ZCZ). The aperiodic crosscorrelation functions (ACCF) of any two distinct IGC codes are zero everywhere if they are from two different groups; when they are drawn from the same group, their ACCFs are zero inside the ZCZ width. This paper presents a direct construction of the IGC code set, which can support interference-free code-division multiplexing using second-order generalized Boolean functions. We relate our construction with a graph where the ZCZ width depends on the number of isolated vertices presented in a graph after the deletion of some vertices. Moreover, our construction is capable of generating the IGC code set with more flexible parameters.	autocorrelation;code;cross-correlation;interference (communication);multiplexing	Palash Sarkar;Sudhan Majhi;Hamsakutty Vettikalladi;Abu Syed Mahajumi	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2856878	bit error rate;discrete mathematics;boolean function;aperiodic graph;distributed computing;autocorrelation;vertex (geometry);correlation;disjoint sets;computer science;multiplexing	Theory	43.54866346505497	49.81550471366831	25389

To each hyperplane, one of the two open hemispheres separated by this hyperplane is selected, and thus an arrangement of hemispheres is obtained. The weight of a face in a cell is the number of hemispheres which contain this face. The number of s-faces with weight k is denoted by fs; k . The arrangement of halfspaces may be de ned in a similar way, except that the number of s-faces with weight k is denoted by gs; k . In this paper, a system of equations on fs; k (resp. gs; k) is established, which enables us to express fs; k with odd s by ft; k with even t¡s and may be considered Dehn–Sommerville equations for arrangements of hemispheres (resp. halfspaces). c © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

A 2–dimensional Fano variety is called a Del Pezzo surface. In higher dimensions, attention originally centered on smooth Fano 3–folds, but singular Fano varieties are also of considerable interest in connection with the minimal model program. The existence of Kähler–Einstein metrics on Fano varieties has also been explored, see [Bourguignon97] for a summary of the main results. Here again the smooth case is of primary interest, but Fano varieties with quotient singularities and their orbifold metrics have also been studied. In any given dimension there are only finitely many families of smooth Fano varieties [Campana91, Nadel91, KoMiMo92], but very little is known about them in dimensions 4 and up. By allowing singularities, infinitely many families appear and their distribution is very poorly understood. A natural experimental testing ground is given by hypersurfaces and complete intersections in weighted projective spaces. These can be written down rather explicitly, but they still provide many more examples than ordinary projective spaces. Experimental lists of certain 3–dimensional complete intersections were compiled by [Fletcher89]. In connection with Kähler–Einstein metrics, the 2–dimensional cases were first investigated in [Demailly-Kollár99] and later in [Johnson-Kollár00]. It is also of interest to study Calabi–Yau hypersurfaces and hyper-surfaces of general type in weighted projective spaces. [Fletcher89] contains some lists with terminal singularities. The aim of this paper is threefold. First, we determine the complete list of anticanonically embedded quasi smooth Fano hypersurfaces in weighted projective 4-spaces. There are 48 infinite series and 4442 sporadic examples (7). As a consequence we obtain that the Reid–Fletcher list (cf. [Fletcher89, II.6.6]) of 95 types of anticanonically embedded quasi smooth terminal Fano threefolds in weighted projective 4-spaces is complete (11). Second, we prove that many of these Fano hypersurfaces admit a Kähler–Einstein metric (15). We also study the nonexistence of tigers on these Fano 3–folds (in the colorful terminology of [Keel-McKernan99]).	compiler;embedded system;fano's inequality;fletcher's checksum	Jennifer M.

831e807967b94d1488c1f03af930e156eb311435	papr problem for walsh systems and related problems		"""High peak values of transmission signals in wireless communication systems lead to wasteful energy consumption and degradation of several transmission performances. We continue the theoretical contributions made by Boche and Farell toward the understanding of peak value reduction, using the strategy known as tone reservation for orthogonal transmission schemes. There it was shown that for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, the combinatorial object called arithmetic progression plays an important role in setting limitations for the applicability of the tone reservation method. In this paper, we show that the combinatorial object introduced as perfect Walsh sum (PWS) plays a similar role for code-division multiple access (CDMA) systems as arithmetic progression for OFDM systems. By specific construction, we show that for a chosen numbers <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$m$ </tex-math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$n$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, all subsets <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$\mathcal {I} $ </tex-math></inline-formula> of the set <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$[N]$ </tex-math></inline-formula> of the first <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$N=2^{n}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> natural numbers, which has the density in <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$[N]$ </tex-math></inline-formula> larger than a given <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$\delta \in (0,1)$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, i.e., <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$\left |{ \mathcal {I} }\right |/N\geq \delta $ </tex-math></inline-formula>, and which is sufficiently large enough, in the sense that <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$\left |{ I }\right |\geq 2(2/\delta)^{2^{m}-1}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, contains a PWS of size <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$2^{m}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>. By means of this result, and motivated by the previously mentioned connection between arithmetic progression and PWS, we show results for the PWS which are analogous to the famous Szemerédi theorem on arithmetic progressions, Conlon-Gower’s theorem on probabilistic construction of “sparse” sets containing an arithmetic progression, and even a solution of an analogon to the Erdős’ conjecture on arithmetic progressions. Those results give in particular an insight into the asymptotic limitations of tone reservation method for the CDMA systems. Besides, we show that a subset <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$I$ </tex-math></inline-formula> of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$[N]$ </tex-math></inline-formula> is a PWS if and only if the embedding inequality of the subspace of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$L^{1}([{0,1}])$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, containing linear combinations of Walsh functions indexed by elements of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$\mathcal {I} $ </tex-math></inline-formula>, holds with the minimum possible embedding constant <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$\sqrt { \left |{ \mathcal {I} }\right |}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>. The corresponding approach based in particular by the fact that the PWSs are the only Walsh sums having unit <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$L^{1}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-norm, proven in this paper. By means of that results, we show that the minimum possible threshold constant for which the tone reservation method is applicable yields <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$\sqrt { \left |{ \mathcal {I} }\right |}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> if and only if the information set <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$\mathcal {I} $ </tex-math></inline-formula> is a PWS."""	color gradient;decision problem;elegant degradation;extremal optimization;hadamard transform;microsoft personal web server;multiplexing;performance;power architecture platform reference;rice's theorem;social inequality;sparse matrix;taxicab geometry	Holger Boche;Ezra Tampubolon	2018	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2018.2846597	inequality;conjecture;combinatorics;linear combination;walsh function;embedding;subspace topology;natural number;computer science;arithmetic progression	Theory	32.67878825729043	38.17766486037732	25840

A new weight function [called the Arithmetic Series Weight Function (ASWF)] of binary integers is defined. By using this weight function, a simple weight-preserved relation among the operands, sums and carries of binary adders is obtained. The error-correcting scheme is based on this relation. The redundancy of this scheme is comparable to that of the other error-control techniques in binary computer arithmetic. Moreover, the error-correcting procedure is simple and can be carried out by solving a simple algebraic equation involving only additive operations.	algebraic equation;arithmetic logic unit;error detection and correction;operand;utility functions on indivisible goods;weight function	Tse Lin Wang;Chao-Kai Liu	1974	IEEE Transactions on Computers	10.1109/T-C.1974.223801	arithmetic;discrete mathematics;error detection and correction;arbitrary-precision arithmetic;binary scaling;computer science;theoretical computer science;saturation arithmetic;affine arithmetic;mathematics;statistics	Vision	42.79022722467267	56.549612269830845	25919

We show that Clarkson’s sampling algorithm can be applied to two separate problems in computational algebra: solving large-scale polynomial systems, for which we utilize a Helly-type result for algebraic varieties, and finding small generating sets of graded ideals. The cornerstone of our work is showing that the theory of violator spaces of Gärtner et al. applies to these polynomial ideal problems. The resulting algorithms have expected runtime linear in the number of input polynomials, making the method particularly interesting for handling systems with very large numbers of polynomials, but whose rank in the vector space of polynomials is small (e.g., when the number of variables is constant).	computation;computer algebra system;linear algebra;mathematical optimization;polynomial;randomized algorithm;sampling (signal processing);spaces	Jesús A.

Using the Hausdorff generalized metric, we show how to construct circular rank correlation coefficients from regular rank correlation coefficients. In addition, we show how generalized triangle inequalities satisfied by generalized metrics on the symmetric group can be used to create new partial rank correlation coefficients (that measure the association between two variables controlling for the effect of a third one).	coefficient;hausdorff dimension	Dongyang Cheng;Petros Hadjicostas	2013	Australasian J.

The proposed attack is based on iterative probabilistic decoding and appropriately generated low-weight parity-checks. The required output sequence length and the computational complexity are both derived.

In particular, we exactly compute the 1-error linear complexity of ternary Sidel’nikov sequences when p ≡ −1 mod 3 and m ≥ 4.

Based on these results, we present the ratios of the linear complexity and the 1-error linear complexity to the period asymptotically.	computational complexity theory;pollard's p − 1 algorithm	Jin-Ho Chung;Kyeongcheol Yang	2006		10.1007/11863854_7	combinatorics;average-case complexity;calculus;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	41.993413289121605	48.19416375718915	26601

Explicit constructions for k = 2 and k = n can be found there. For general k out of n schemes bounds have been described. Here, two general k out of n constructions are presented. Their parameters are related to those of maximum size arcs or MDS codes. Further, results on the structure of k out of n schemes, such as bounds on their parameters, are obtained. Finally, the notion of coloured visual secret sharing schemes is introduced and a general construction is given.	arcs (computing);calculus of constructions;code;maximal set;modulo operation;secret sharing	Eric R.

adfceb15d15062796a6a12704f76e0561daac99e	a simple definition for the universal grassmannian order	coxeter group;bruhat order;weak order;generating function	In this paper, we provide a combinatorial definition of the Universal Grassmannian order (or the Grassmannian Bruhat order) of Bergeron and Sottile. This defines the order in terms of inversions, and thus the order can be viewed as a generalization of the weak order for Coxeter groups. Finally, we use this understanding of the order to analyze the generating function of the number of elements at rank n in this order. r 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved. In [BeS], Bergeron and Sottile defined a new partial order on the symmetric group, which they called the universal Grassmannian order. They used this order to examine the coefficients of the Littlewood–Richardson polynomials, obtaining some new and interesting results. They continued their study of this order in [BeS2,BeS3], where they noted a strange correspondence between the right-sided universal Grassmannian order and the left-sided weak Bruhat order. Unfortunately, this order is quite complicated to define, involving the k-Bruhat order (related to Grassmannian permutations with a single descent at k), making it difficult to examine the combinatorial properties of the Grassmannian order. In this paper, we present an equivalent definition of this order based on permutation statistics together with an application of this characterization. This new definition also explains the correspondence between the right universal Grassmannian order and the left weak Bruhat order. E-mail address: cbennett@lmu.edu (C.D. Bennett).

This paper does not assume a great deal of background on the part of the reader. Definitions not stated in the paper can be found in [H], and much of the motivation behind studying these partial orders appears in [F]. The authors are grateful to F. Sottile for his comments on these results and to C. Holland and J. Hayden for their help. Some of the results of this paper can be found in the Ph.D. thesis of Evani [E]. 1. Definitions of the orders In this section we define the BeSo order and the universal Grassmannian order. Let Sn denote the symmetric group on the numbers 1;y; n; with permutations acting on the left so that multiplication is read from right to left. As we will need to distinguish between ordinary parentheses, cycle notation, and operations, for sASn and iAf1;y; ng; we use s1⁄2i to denote s applied to i: For permutations, we shall use both the cycle notation (where we will not use commas) and line notation, where a1;y; an denotes the permutation s with s1⁄2i 1⁄4 ai: We define an inversion of the permutation s as an ordered pair ði; jÞ with ioj and s1⁄2i s1⁄2j ; and InvðsÞ denotes the set of all inversions of s: An output inversion is the pair ðs1⁄2i ; s1⁄2j Þ; where ði; jÞ is an inversion of s: (Note that in [S], Stanley uses inversion for our output inversions. Our notation, however, is consistent with that of [BeS].) Finally, if o is a partial order on a set S; we say that b is a cover of a if aob and apgpb implies a 1⁄4 g or b 1⁄4 g: We denote this covering relation by a!b: (This notation is different from that of [BeS], but is more standard in the literature.) Define spwa in the left weak Bruhat order on Sn if and only if InvðsÞDInvðaÞ: Writing cðsÞ 1⁄4 jInvðsÞj for the length of the permutation s; we have a covers s in the left weak Bruhat order if and only if a 1⁄4 ði i þ 1Þs and cðaÞ 1⁄4 cðsÞ þ 1; explaining the use of the adjective left in this definition. (The right weak Bruhat order is given by containment on output inversions.) The rank of s in the left weak Bruhat order is given by the length of s (see [S]). Throughout this paper, we shall use the term weak order to denote the left weak Bruhat order. For a fixed k; the (right) k-Bruhat order ðpkÞ on Sn is generated by the covering relation s%ksði jÞ; where ipkoj and cðsÞ þ 1 1⁄4 cðsði jÞÞ: We can now define the Grassmannian order for Sn by defining apGb in the Grassmannian order if and only if there exists a k together with a gASn such that gpkgapkgb: In [BeS], it is shown that the Grassmannian order forms a partial order on Sn: This definition is useful when using the Grassmannian order for understanding relationships associated to the generic k-Bruhat orders, but it is difficult to use to examine the combinatorial aspects of the order.

For certain numbers of rows and columns, the minimum rank of a pattern is k only when there is a k-by-k such triangle. Here, we complete the determination of such sizes by showing that an m-by-n pattern of minimum rank k must contain a k-triangle for m=5, k=4; m=6, k=5; and m=6, k=4. A table is given showing whether or not this happens for all m, n, k. In the process, a Schur complement approach to minimum rank is described and used, and simple ways to recognize the presence of triangles of sizes less than 7 are given.		Charles R. Johnson;Joshua A.

The performance of such implant-to-body-surface communication is dependent on the characteristics of the transmitter, the receiver and the channel between them, which consists of layers of biological tissue. In this paper a representative ICT has been studied to characterize the effect of different physical orientations on the bit error process. The effect of biological tissue on the communication channel has also been quantified. The channel was measured to have a bit-level memory of 3 bits and a packet level memory of 6 packets. The impact of forward error correction (FEC) was analyzed and the use of 3-bit FEC was found to reduce the number of retransmissions by 65%. The results of this study enable optimization of reliable implantable communication systems.	approximation algorithm;bit error rate;bit-level parallelism;channel (communications);channel memory;emitter-coupled logic;error detection and correction;experiment;forward error correction;ion implantation;mathematical optimization;network packet;quantifier (logic);retransmission (data networks);throughput;transceiver;transmitter;vii;x.690	Awais M.

Our proof gives information in terms of the zeta function of an associated variety. We carry out an explicit determination of the weight distribution in two cases, for the cyclic codes with zeros α3, α5 and α, α11. These are the smallest cases of two infinite families where finding the weight distribution is an open problem. Finally, an interesting application of our methods is that we can prove that these two codes have the same weight distribution for all odd n. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

A popular method of protection is via the Reed-Solomon (RS) code with two parity check symbols. In the present paper we construct alternative examples of linear block codes protecting against two erasures. Our construction is based on an abstract notion of cone. Concrete cones are constructed via matrix representations of cyclic groups of prime order. In particular, this construction produces EVENODD code. Interesting conditions on the prime number arise in our analysis of these codes. At the end, we analyse an assembly implementation of the corresponding system on a general purpose processor and compare its write and recovery speed with the standard DP-RAID system.	array data structure;bitwise operation;block code;cone (formal languages);exclusive or;grammatical framework;linear code;matrix representation;maximal set;non-standard raid levels;plug-in (computing);reed–solomon error correction;root of unity;simulation;standard raid levels	R.

For many convolutional codes, the trellis complexity (TC) of the minimal module is significantly less than the TC of the conventional module. An alternative representation, consisting of an extended BCJR trellis module and a pruned version of the conventional module, was recently introduced. In this letter, we prove that the overall TC of the two new modules is less than the TC of the conventional module for infinitely many codes. Furthermore, we show that the overall TC of the new modules is smaller than the TC of the minimal module for many codes considered in the literature.	bcjr algorithm;convolutional code;trellis quantization	Kjell Jørgen Hole	1998	IEEE Trans.

In this problem, the state of information can only be updated to a limited number of new states, and errors may occur in memory cells between two adjacent updates. We propose two coding schemes based on the models of trajectory codes. The bounds on achievable code rates are shown using polar WOM coding. Our schemes generalize the existing rewriting codes in multiple ways, and can be applied to various practical scenarios such as file editing, log-based file systems and file synchronization systems.	code;error detection and correction;file synchronization;flash memory;memory cell (binary);rewriting	Yue Li;Anxiao Jiang;Jehoshua Bruck	2014	2014 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2014.6875201	parallel computing;real-time computing;computer science;theoretical computer science	Embedded	37.348538324376094	58.89255620894647	27249

4ac72b6cb6c8f57b4ca8ef2e84ec26ab322e6cd2	parametric linear systems: the two parameter case	linear system	Randomized black box algorithms provide a very efficient means for solving sparse linear systems over arbitrary fields. However, when these probabilistic algorithms fail, it is not revealed whether no solution exists or whether the algorithm simply made unlucky random choices. Here we give an efficient algorithm to compute a certificate of inconsistency for a linear system. The cost of producing such a certificate is shown to be about the same as that of solving the system in the black box model, while the cost of using a certificate to prove inconsistency is much smaller. More specifically, given a matrix A • F ~×~ over a field F and a vector b • F ×1, we show how to compute a vector u • F lxn such that uA = 0 and ub-fi O. This clearly demonstrates that Ax = b has no solution x • F ~×I. Intuitively such certificates are dense in the left nullspace of A. If b is not in the column span of A, then b is orthogonal to al~ most a proper subspace of the left nullspace of A. Thus, with high probability a random element of this left nullspace is a certificate. The cost of this algorithm is measured in terms of black-box evaluations w ~ wA, for w • F l×n. The algorithm requires an expected O(r) such black-box evaluations plus an additional O(rn) operations in F, where r is the rank of A. Additional space for O(n) values from F is needed. This is approximately the cost of solving a consistent system having the same black box matrix, using Wiedemann's algorithm. It should be noted that the black box evaluations used here compute vector-times-matrix products rather than the matrix-times-vector products used in Wiedemann's algorithm. We extend our techniques to provide certificates of inconsistency for sparse Diophantine systems Ax-b, where A • Z ~×~, b • Z ~×1 and where integer solutions x • Z ~×1 are sought. The interesting case here is when rational solutions to the system do exist. In this case, a certificate of inconsistency is a vector u • Z l×n and an integer d such that uA ~ 0 rood d while ub :~ 0 rood d. The integer d is a divisor of the largest determinantal divisor of A. A certificate can be found with about the same cost as that of solving a consistent Diophantine system …	black box;kernel (linear algebra);linear system;polynomial greatest common divisor;public key certificate;randomized algorithm;sparse matrix;the matrix;with high probability	Mark Giesbrecht;B.

Some numerical characteristics showing the cardinality of equivalence classes are introduced. A combinatorial identity that is in relationship to these characteristics of the set of all bipartite graphs of the type g = 〈Rg ∪ Cg, Eg〉 is formulated and proved, where V = Rg ∪ Cg is the set of vertices, Eg is the set of edges of the graph g, |Rg | = m ≥ 1, |Cg | = n ≥ 1, |Eg| = k ≥ 0, m,n and k are integers.	graph (discrete mathematics);numerical analysis;turing completeness;vertex (geometry);vertex (graph theory)	Krasimir Yordzhev	2014	CoRR		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;mathematics;geometry;algebra	Theory	30.58901280901411	33.46519469911905	27483

In this paper, we develop LiE subroutines to find representatives of conjugacy classes of polarizable theta-stable parabolic subalgebras. Using a theorem of Tauvel, we implement algorithms for computing the Kℂ-saturation of the nilradical of such parabolic subalgebras. Furthermore, we provide a tool for testing a long standing conjecture that relates the wave front set of a representation of a real or p-adic group to special nilpotent orbits. Incidently, the conjecture is true for classical groups.	parabolic antenna	Steven Glenn Jackson;Alfred G.

The reservoir is applied to every vertex of an input graph, realizing a contractive encoding process and resulting in a structured state isomorphic to the input. Whenever an unstructured output is required, a state mapping function maps the structured state into a fixed-size feature representation that feeds the linear readout. In this paper we propose an alternative approach, based on distance-weighted nearest neighbor, to realize a more flexible readout exploiting the state information computed for every vertex according to its individual relevance.	map;relevance;reservoir computing;vertex (geometry);vertex (graph theory)	Claudio Gallicchio;Alessio Micheli	2011			nearest neighbor graph;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;machine learning;cycle graph;vertex;mathematics;graph state;neighbourhood	NLP	25.259486898844745	36.45909960706389	27924

It has been proved by Xu and Chang that the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an r-SOLS(n) is n≤r≤n2n≤r≤n2 and r∉{n+1,n2−1}r∉{n+1,n2−1} with 26 genuine exceptions and 26 possible exceptions.

In this paper, we obtain a hybrid of these bounds, which improves both. This in turn is based on the anticode bound, which is a hybrid of the Hamming and Singleton bounds and improves both bounds. The question of convexity of the asymptotic rate function is an important open question. We conjecture a much weaker form of the convexity, and we show that our bounds follow immediately if we assume the conjecture.	asymptote;bekenstein bound;binary code;code (cryptography);convex function;plotkin bound;window function	Krishna V.

We perform an indepth study of a particular example that can be thought of as an extension to Arikan’s polar code [2]. Notably, our numerical simulation show that this code polarizes the logical channels more strongly while retaining the log-linear decoding complexity using the successive cancellation decoder. These codes also display improved error-correcting capability with only a minor impact on decoding complexity. Efficient decoding is realized using powerful graphical calculus tools developed in the field of quantum manybody physics. In a companion paper [3], we generalize our construction to the quantum setting and describe more in-depth the relation between classical and quantum error correction and the graphical calculus of tensor networks.	computer simulation;error detection and correction;log-linear model;polar code (coding theory);quantum error correction	Andrew J.

In particular, we show that the projective and affine hyperplane sequences of odd order both have full linear span. Another application involves the parity sequence of order n, which has period pn - 1 and linear span vL(s) where v = (pn - 1)/(p - 1) and L(s) is the linear span of a parity sequence of order 1. The determination of the linear span of the parity sequence of order 1 leads to an interesting open problem involving primes.	span and div	Agnes Hui Chan;Richard A.

Codebooks traditionally consist of permutations with specific distance properties. A class of permutation codes was presented where a codeword consists of a sequence or concatenation of permutations, rather than a single permutation. These codebooks were constructed to correct substitution or deletion errors. In this paper, permutations are concatenated to form codewords with the goal of detecting and correcting adjacent transposition errors. An outer code is used to detect erroneous permutations in the codeword, using additional parity permutations. The symbol diversity of permutation codes is preserved and codebooks with higher cardinalities are constructed which result in better code rates.	cardinality (data modeling);code word;codebook;concatenated error correction code;concatenation;cyclic permutation;error detection and correction;flash memory;hamming code;modulation;parity bit;qr code;sensor	Reolyn Heymann;Jos H.

Each codon has a complement – an anticodon – and syllogisms have such too. Another point is that codons and syllogisms consist of 3 of 4 possible building blocks. So 64 syllogisms should exist, but only 19 make sense. Each syllogism is a set operation, which I can represent with Shegalkin-Polynomials [1]. This needs a continuous view, which is ordinary in biological systems. It accrues matrices with special properties. They are self-similar, that means they can be generated with a tensor product of their own. Other methods work with power sets or multidimensional tetrahedral numbers. Because of these different generation methods it can be shown, that the matrices can be generated with a cellular automaton. Each cellular automaton is producible with a linear automaton [2-7], so there is an other aspect of dependence of the this model and decoding of amino acids. The decoding of amino acids follows the rules of a linear automaton. In order to combine the fields of syllogisms and amino acids a different representation for them is used – a tetrahedral grid. This is possible, because the number of syllogisms and amino acids is not only a square number, it is also a triangle number. Prof. Dr. Franke's matrices [8] let me construct such a grid, because of their structure of a Pascal triangle.	biological system;cellular automaton;complement (complexity);fuzzy set operations;herbert w. franke;polynomial ring;self-similarity	Karl Heuer	2007	BMC Systems Biology	10.1186/1752-0509-1-S1-P34	computational biology;biology;computer science;bioinformatics;theoretical computer science;genetic code;systems biology	ML	43.91272416382336	37.35823530724426	28848

Using the same approach, two new constructions with large family sizes and low maximum correlation are given. The first construction is an analog of one recent result derived from the interleaved structure of Sidel'nikov sequences. For a prime p and an integer M|(p-1), the new M-ary sequence families of period p are obtained from irreducible quadratic polynomials and known power residue-based sequence families. The new sequence families increase family sizes of the known power residue-based sequence families, but keep the maximum correlation unchanged. In the second construction, the sequences derived from the Weil representation are generalized, where each new sequence is the elementwise product of a modulated Sidel'nikov sequence and a modulated trace sequence. For positive integers d <; p and M|(pn-1), the new family consists of (M-1)pnd sequences with period pn-1, alphabet size Mp, and the maximum correlation bounded by (d+1)√{pn}+3.	irreducibility;modulation;polynomial;polyphase matrix;time complexity	Zilong Wang;Guang Gong;Nam Yul Yu	2013	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2013.2243496	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;sequence;mathematics;integer sequence;polynomial;algebra	Theory	42.03501798771891	48.345741099422675	28881

The permutation group of Reed-Muller codes is the general affine group and can be decomposed into the semi-direct product of the translation group and the general linear group. The action of the translation group projects the second order Reed-Muller code onto copies of the first order Reed-Muller code. The general linear group projects the code onto codes for which we can control the useful length and the dimension. These parameters depend on the dimension of the eigenspace of the chosen element of the general linear group for the eigenvalue 1.	reed–muller code;reed–solomon error correction;semiconductor industry	Matthieu Legeay;Pierre Loidreau	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings	10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283977	block code;reed–muller code;polynomial code;concatenated error correction code;prefix code;binary code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;constant-weight code;low-density parity-check code;linear code;mathematics;group code;reed–solomon error correction;general linear group;statistics;algebra	Crypto	41.079637503051224	54.89749748087378	29442

The error-correcting properties are evaluated by a metric called the free distance, which is always greater than one in the case of the proposed RVLCs. Since variable length codes (VLCs) typically have free distance equal to one, the proposed RVLCs exhibit significant improvement in symbol error rate relative to VLCs constructed using standard methods.	algorithm;error detection and correction;variable-length code	Ksenija Lakovic;John D.

In the first one [15] we discussed foundations of this theory. Definitions necessary for independent understanding of the present article are given in the introduction and the first section. The theory of exponential groups begins with results of A.Mal’cev [11], P.Hall [7], G.Baumslag [4] and R.Lyndon [9]. The axiomatic notion of an exponential group was introduced by R.Lyndon (1960). In [13] a new axiom was added to Lyndon’s definition to obtain a new notion of an exponential group. The refined version is more convenient because it coincides exactly with the notion of a module over a ring in the abelian case, whereas abelian exponential groups after Lyndon provide a far wider class. Recall the main definition from [13]. Let A be an arbitrary associative ring with identity and G a group. Fix an action of the ring A on G, i.e. a map G×A → G. The result of the action of α ∈ A on g ∈ G is written as g. Consider the following axioms:	time complexity	Alexei G. Myasnikov;Vladimir N.

This partition provides insights into the sequence properties. To date, for any given sequence, only ad hoc methods have been available to identify this partition. We apply a new concept—the spot-based generation sequence—to derive a general methodology for identifying this partition for a large class of meta-Fibonacci sequences. This class includes the Conolly and Conway sequences and many of their well-behaved variants, and even some highly chaotic sequences, such as Hofstadter's famous Q-sequence.

While regenerating codes minimize the data downloaded for node repair, codes with locality minimize the number of nodes accessed during repair. In this paper, we provide some constructions of codes with locality, in which the local codes are regenerating codes, thereby combining the advantages of both classes of codes. The proposed constructions achieve an upper bound on minimum distance and are hence optimal. The constructions include both the cases when the local regenerating codes correspond to the MSR point as well as the MBR point on the storage repair-bandwidth tradeoff curve.	clustered file system;code (cryptography);locality of reference;storage area network	Govinda M.

Normally, molecular components are unique, and thus the drugs can be identified based on it. However, this procedure started to be more unreliable with the introduction of new ATS molecular structures which are increasingly complex and sophisticated. Hence, unique characteristics of molecular structure of ATS drug must be accurately identified. Therefore, this paper is meant for formulating an exact 3D geometric moment invariants to represent the drug molecular structure. The performance of the proposed technique was analyzed using drug chemical structures obtained from United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and also from various sources. The evaluation shows the technique is qualified to be further explored and adapted in the future works to be fully compatible with ATS drug identification domain.	ats;computation;experiment;facebook platform;feature extraction;stepping level	Satrya Fajri Pratama;Azah Kamilah Muda;Yun-Huoy Choo;Ajith Abraham	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-28031-8_30	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;geometry	Comp.	51.692812542578444	35.167749449571836	30072

54f4b3990597e83387b499b304c799bdf515104b	quasi-symmetric designs and self-dual codes	quasi-symmetric design;self-dual code	The terminology and notations from design theory used in this paper are standard (cf. [1], [4], [6]). A 2-( v, k, A) design is quasi-symmetric with intersection numbers x, y(x < y) if the cardinality of the intersection of any two blocks is x or y. Quasi-symmetric designs are extensively studied because of their connections with strongly regular graphs. Well known examples of quasi-symmetric designs are: the Steiner systems S(2, k, v) which are not projective planes; the mUltiples of symmetric designs; the quasi-residual 2-(v, k, 2) designs; the strongly resolvable 2-designs. Following Neumaier [10], we call a quasisymmetric design exceptional, if it does not belong to any of the above four classes. Neumaier [10] has investigated quasi-symmetric designs by use of various necessary conditions for strongly regular graphs. In particular, these conditions left 23 sets of parameters for exceptional 2-( v, k, A) designs in the range 2k ~ v < 40. For 8 of these 23 parameter sets quasi-symmetric designs are known to exist, and the remaining cases were open. In this paper we apply self-orthogonal codes as a tool for investigating quasi-symmetric designs. Using the classification of certain self-dual codes, we prove that quasi-symmetric 2-(28,7,16) or 2-(29,7,12) designs do not exist, and the classical quasi-symmetric 2(21,6,4), 2-(21,7,12) and 2-(22,7,16) designs constructed by Goethals and Seidel [5] on the base of the unique Steiner system S(5, 8, 24) are unique up to isomorphism. The same method was applied in [14] for proving that there are exactly five isomorphism classes of quasi-symmetric 2-(31,7,7) designs.	code;emoticon;quasisymmetric function;steiner tree problem;strongly regular graph	Vladimir D.

This paper investigates how to compute faster doubling over fields of characteristic two. We derive explicit doubling formulae making strong use of the defining equation of the curve. We analyze how many field operations are needed depending on the curve making clear how much generality one loses by the respective choices. Note, that none of the proposed types is known to be weak – one only could be suspicious because of the more special types. Our results allow to choose curves from a large enough variety which have extremely fast doubling needing only half the time of an addition. Combined with a sliding window method this leads to fast computation of scalar multiples. We also speed up the general case.	algorithm;computation;defining equation (physical chemistry);period-doubling bifurcation	Tanja Lange;Marc Stevens	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-30564-4_12	discrete mathematics;jacobian curve;hyperelliptic curve cryptography;mathematics;geometry;hyperelliptic curve;algebra	ML	45.28707563536688	39.998591378140574	30484

Section 1 presents an informal example intended to clarify the nature of the problem, while Secs. 2 and 3 give some formal definitions and characterizations. Section 4 shows that the problem we are considering is equivalent to finding the lexicographically smallest topological sorting in a partial order.	lexicographical order;order by;topological sorting	Anatoly V.

In particular, one of the most important applications of pseudorandomness is cryptography. If, e.g., we want to use a binary sequence E""""N@?{-1,+1}^N (after transforming it into a bit sequence) as a key stream in the standard Vernam cipher [A. Menezes, P. van Oorschot, R. Vanstone, Handbook of Applied Cryptography, CRC Press, Boca Raton, 1997], then E""""N must possess certain pseudorandom properties. Does E""""N need to possess both small well-distribution measure and, for any fixed small k, small correlation measure of order k? In other words, if W(E""""N) is large, resp. C""""k(E""""N) is large for some fixed small k, then can the enemy utilize this fact to break the code? The most natural line of attack is the exhaustive search: the attacker may try all the binary sequences E""""N@?{-1,+1}^N with large W(E""""N), resp. large C""""k(E""""N), as a potential key stream. Clearly, this attack is really threatening only if the number of sequences E""""N@?{-1,+1}^N with(i)large W(E""""N), resp. (ii)large C""""k(E""""N) is ''much less'' than the total number 2^N of sequences in {-1,+1}^N, besides one needs a fast algorithm to generate the sequences of type (i), resp. (ii). The case (i) is easy, thus, for the sake of completeness, here we just present an estimate for the number of sequences E""""N with large W(E""""N). The case (ii), i.e., the case of large correlation is much more interesting: this case will be studied in Section 2. In Section 3 we will sharpen the results of Section 2 in the special case when the order of the correlation is 2. Finally, in Section 4 we will study a lemma, which plays a crucial role in the estimation of the correlation in some of the most important constructions of pseudorandom binary sequences."""

It is obtained from the observation of the equivalency between the erasure correction technique of the RS code and the polynomial interpolation. The structure is very simple and yields a ring equation that can appropriately denoted by z1 + · · · + zn = v, which represents the summation of n evaluations of a polynomial. We also show how to extend the generic RST scheme [6] to a t-out-n threshold ring signature scheme.	digital signature;intel matrix raid;norm (social);polynomial interpolation;reed–solomon error correction;ring signature	Duncan S.

Delay modeling is organized around chains of switches and nodes called stages, instead of logic gates. The use of stages permits both logic gates and pass transistor arrays to be handled in a uniform fashion. Three delay models are presented, ranging from an RC model that typically errs by 25% to a slope-based model whose delay estimates are typically within 10% of SPICE's estimates. The slope model is parameterized in terms of the ratio between the slopes of a stage's input and output waveforms. All the models have been implemented in the Crystal timing analyzer. They are evaluated by comparing their delay estimates to SPICE, using a dozen critical paths from two VLSI designs.

Such functions are found by heuristic search in the space of rotation symmetric Boolean functions (RSBFs). This shows that there exist Boolean functions on n (odd) variables having nonlinearity >2n-1-2n-1/2 if and only if n>7. Using similar search technique, balanced Boolean functions on 9, 10, and 11 variables are attained having autocorrelation spectra with maximum absolute value <2lceiln/2rceil. On odd number of variables, earlier such functions were known for 15, 21 variables; there was no evidence of such functions at all on even number of variables. In certain cases, our functions can be affinely transformed to obtain first-order resiliency or first-order propagation characteristics.

a761ed0b668df298eb2644b2338ac948070b38ec	upper bounds for the inverse sum indeg index of graphs		Abstract Let G = ( V , E ) , V = { 1 , 2 , … , n } , be a simple connected graph with n vertices, and m edges, and let Δ = d 1 ≥ d 2 ≥ ⋯ ≥ d n = δ u003e 0 , d i = d ( i ) , be a sequence of its vertex degrees. A vertex-degree-based topological index, called inverse sum indeg index, is defined as I S I = ∑ i ∼ j d i d j d i + d j , where i ∼ j denotes adjacency of vertices i and j . We first give analysis of some upper bounds for I S I reported in the literature. Then we determine new upper bounds for I S I in terms of some other vertex-degree-based indices.		M. M.

aae6dc9b42eef1d599019a44a58999a7a7749327	on the r-shifted central coefficients of riordan matrices		By presenting Riordan matrix as a triangle, the central coefficients are entries in the central column. Starting at the central column, the r-shifted central coefficients are entries in column r of the right part of the triangle.This paper aims to characterize the r-shifted central coefficients of Riordan matrices. Here we will concentrate on four elements of the subgroups of the Riordan group, that is, the Bell subgroup, the associated subgroup, the derivative subgroup, and the hitting time subgroup. Some examples are presented to show how we deduce the generating functions for interesting sequences by using different means of calculating these r-shifted central coefficients. Besides, we make some extensions in the Bell subgroup.		Sai-nan Zheng;Sheng-Liang Yang	2014	J.

In fact, it turns out that the crucial point to solve the simplification problem in general is to solve this same problem for hypercircles [2].

During this mapping, wordlengths are searched to minimize total hardware cost and maximize system performance. Complexity and distortion measures have been separately researched for optimum wordlength selection. This paper proposes a complexity-and-distortion measure (CDM) method that combines these two measures. The CDM method trades off these two measures using a weighting factor. The proposed method is applied to wordlength design of a fixed broadband wireless demodulator. For this case study, the proposed method finds the optimal solution in one-third the time that exhaustive search takes. The contributions of this paper are: (1) a generalization of search methods based on complexity or distortion measures; (2) a framework of automatic wordlength optimization; and (3) a wireless demodulator case study.	algorithm;brute-force search;complexity;digital electronics;digital signal processing;distortion;fixed point (mathematics);mathematical optimization;trionic	Kyungtae Han;Brian L.

Experimental results confirm that existing noise analysis approaches based on linear superposition of the propagated and crosstalk-injected noise can be highly inaccurate, thus impairing the sign-off functional verification phase, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method that can be seamlessly integrated into noise analysis tools.	crosstalk;glitch;macromodel;nonlinear system;performance;signal integrity;superposition principle;waveform	Cristiano Forzan;Davide Pandini	2005		10.1145/1057661.1057734	electronic engineering;crosstalk;telecommunications;computer science;signal integrity;engineering;noise measurement;electrical engineering;noise;noise floor;functional verification	EDA	25.658248258673442	54.485933972987546	32659

This note is a brief discussion of problems and new results involving orthogonal spreads, translation planes and associated generalized Kerdock codes. 1. Orthogonal spreads Let V be a vector space of dimension 4m over a finite field L of characteristic 2, where m 2 2. Assume that V is equipped with a quadratic form Q of Witt index 2m; the associated bilinear form is denoted (u, u). Then the pair V, Q is equivalent to the pair L4m, Qdm, where Write the standard ordered basis of L4m as e,, . . . , ezm,fi, . . . ,hrn, so that Qdm(ei) = Q4,Jfi) = (ei, ej) = (5, fi) = 0 and (e,, fi) = 6, for 1 c i, i s 2m. We will be concerned with totally singular 2m-spaces. Examples of these are E = (e,, . . .,ezm) andF=(f,,.. . , hm). Each totally singular 2m-space having only 0 in common with E looks like with M a skew-symmetric 2m x 2m matrix (1.1) Correspondence to: W.M.

There are 226 nets with G∼=Z2 ×Z2, and 13 nets with G∼=Z4. Using a (4,4)-net with full automorphism group of smallest order, the lower bound on the number of pairwise non-isomorphic affine 2-(64,16,5) designs is improved to 21,621,600. The classification of classregular (4,4)-nets implies the classification of all generalized Hadamard matrices (or difference matrices) of order 16 over a group of order four up to monomial equivalence. The binary linear codes spanned by the incidence matrices of the nets, as well as the quaternary and Z4-codes spanned by the generalized Hadamard matrices are computed and classified. The binary codes include the affine geometry [64,16,16] code spanned by the planes in AG(3,4) and two other inequivalent codes with the same weight distribution. These codes support non-isomorphic affine 2-(64,16,5) designs that have the same 2-rank as the classical affine design in AG(3,4), hence provide counter-examples to Hamada’s conjecture. Many of the F4-codes spanned by generalized Hadamard matrices are self-orthogonal with respect to the Hermitian inner product and yield quantum error-correcting codes, including some codes with optimal parameters.	binary code;error detection and correction;forward error correction;graph automorphism;hadamard transform;incidence matrix;monomial;turing completeness	Masaaki Harada;Clement W.

0583c89f2ab9e588f3f2094704249a3e1f932ae1	an arithmetic analogue of fox's triangle removal argument		We give an arithmetic version of the recent proof of the triangle removal lemma by Fox [Fox11], for the group F2 . A triangle in F2 is a triple (x, y, z) such that x + y + z = 0. The triangle removal lemma for F2 states that for every ε > 0 there is a δ > 0, such that if a subset A of F2 requires the removal of at least ε·2n elements to make it trianglefree, then it must contain at least δ · 22n triangles. This problem was first studied by Green [Gre05] who proved a lower bound on δ using an arithmetic regularity lemma. Regularity based lower bounds for triangle removal in graphs were recently improved by Fox and we give a direct proof of an analogous improvement for triangle removal in F2 . The improved lower bound was already known to follow (for triangle-removal in all groups), using Fox’s removal lemma for directed cycles and a reduction by Král, Serra and Vena [KSV09] (see [Fox11, CF13]).

If the spectrum X is exactly k-sparse (where k <;<; n), can we do better? We show that asymptotically in k and n, when k is sub-linear in n (i.e., k ∝ nδ where 0 <; δ <; 1), and the support of the non-zero DFT coefficients is uniformly random, we can exploit this sparsity in two fundamental ways (i) sample complexity: we need only M = rk deterministically chosen samples of the input signal x (where r <; 4 when 0 <; δ <; 0.99); and (ii) computational complexity: we can reliably compute the DFT X using O(k log k) operations, where the constants in the big Oh are small. Our algorithm succeeds with high probability, with the probability of failure vanishing to zero asymptotically in the number of samples acquired, M. Our approach is based on filterless subsampling of the input signal x using a small set of carefully chosen uniform subsampling patterns guided by the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). Specifically, our subsampling operation on x is designed to create aliasing patterns on the spectrum X that """"look like"""" parity-check constraints of good erasure-correcting sparse-graph codes. We show how computing the sparse DFT X is equivalent to decoding of these sparse-graph codes and is low in both sample complexity and decoding complexity. We accordingly dub our algorithm the FFAST (Fast Fourier Aliasing-based Sparse Transform) algorithm. In our analysis, we rigorously connect our CRT based graph constructions to random sparse-graph codes based on a balls-and-bins model and analyze the convergence behavior of the latter using well-studied density evolution techniques from coding theory. We provide simulation results in Section IV that corroborate our theoretical findings, and validate the empirical performance of the FFAST algorithm."""	algorithm;aliasing;cathode ray tube;chroma subsampling;coding theory;coefficient;computational complexity theory;discrete fourier transform;fast fourier transform;jamie wilkinson;sample complexity;simulation;sparse graph code;sparse matrix;with high probability	Sameer Pawar;Kannan Ramchandran	2013	2013 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2013.6620269	fast fourier transform;mathematical optimization;discrete-time fourier transform;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;short-time fourier transform;graph theory;theoretical computer science;discrete fourier transform;communication complexity;mathematics;discrete fourier transform;prime-factor fft algorithm;statistics;cyclotomic fast fourier transform	Theory	45.13918221331042	59.143293698158445	32861

f3ff2ebf7770f031ba00428902401682d117de11	codes for self-clocking, ac-coupled transmission: aspects of synthesis and analysis	look ahead;data processing;satisfiability;upper bound	We consider NRZI waveform codes that satisfy a given set of run-length constraints and the upper bound on the accumulated dc charge of the waveform. These constraints enable the codeword to be self-clocking, ac-coupled, and suitable for data processing tape and communication applications. Various aspects of synthesis and analysis of such codes, called ( d , k , C ) codes, are illustrated by means of several examples. The choice of the initial state of the encoder is shown to influence the length of the data sequence over which the encoder must look-ahead. Introduction In the transmission of binary data, whether on a communication link or through a magnetic recording head onto a tape, it is generally desirable to encode the data to achieve self-synchronization. A widely accepted method of obtaining this self-clocking property is to ensure that the waveforms on the channel provide a guaranteed minimum spacing between the detectable transitions. With this method it is convenient to use ac coupling of the waveform into the channel. In the case of rotatinghead magnetic recording, transformer coupling of the signal becomes a necessity. The codes we describe here are aimed at such applications. The object of this paper is not to describe production of such codes per se, but rather to introduce some methods of synthesizing and analyzing these codes in order to achieve flexibility of choice in the design of a system. Various waveform coding methods are used in tape applications; nonreturn to zero (NRZ) , NRZ inverse (NRZI) , phase modulation (PM), frequency modulation (FM) , and modified FM (MFM ) are some of the well known techniques. The NRZI method is widely used at the encoder-channel boundary; it accepts the binary input string and produces as output for the recording head a ONE for transition at every bit interval. Kobayashi and Tang [ 11 discuss the inherent potential of NRZI waveforms for some kinds of error detection. In this paper we assume the use of the NRZI waveform for the sake of conformity, even though the techniques are also appli358 cable to the direct-waveform NRZ method. S . 1. HONC AND D. L. OSTAPKO In NRZI terms, the required maximum spacing between transitions in a system that uses self-clocking becomes the number of maximum allowable consecutive zeros, k , in the codewords. In general, it is also desirable to set a lower bound d, for the space between transitions, which is the minimum allowable string of zeros in the codewords. The waveform pulse width is then bound between the two limits ( d + l ) and ( k + l ) , which are directly related to the upper and the lower cutoff frequencies of the read-write head and the supporting circuitry, respectively. The ratio d l k gives an indication of the bandwidth of these circuits and therefore should be small for design reasons. The lower bound d on the run of zeros also influences the interference between recorded transitions in saturation recording and limits the spectrum spread in frequency-shift keying [ 21. Many run-length-limited codes with (d, k ) constraints have been reported [ 2 101. Tang [ 4 ,5 ] , Gabor [ 61, and Kautz [7] describe block-oriented, run-length-limited codes for tape applications. Tang and Bahl [ 101 compute the number of (d, k)-limited sequences of given block length and the asymptotic information rate of such codes. Franaszek [ 2 , 31 uses a sequence-state approach in the construction of blockor variable-length codes. Gilder [ 81 reports on the successful use, in a Bell and Howell highdensity tape system, of a simple scheme that forces an additional odd parity bit at small intervals of NRZ data, thereby achieving a guaranteed transition in every two such intervals. IBM J . RES. DEVELOP. The ac-coupling requirement further imposes a charge constraint. The waveform should have neither lengthy nor high-magnitude dc components. Expanding on Tang’s notation, we consider (d , k, C) codes, where C is an upper bound on the accumulated charge of the waveform, ulf, . . . &:fi = 1 or -1). The ( d , k, C) codes have two primary constraints, d 5 run of zeros in code 5 k , and (1 )	binary data;block code;clock rate;code word;conformity;develop;digital recording;encode;electronic circuit;encoder;error detection and correction;fm broadcasting;interference (communication);key (cryptography);magnetic storage;parity bit;pulse-width modulation;read-write memory;run-length encoding;self-clocking signal;self-replication;transformer;variable-length code;waveform;whole earth 'lectronic link	Se June Hong;Daniel L.

In this article we identify the structure of intervals in this metric space by constructing, for each isometry, an explicit combinatorial model encoding all of its minimal length reflection factorizations. The model is largely independent of the isometry chosen in that it only depends on whether or not some point is fixed and the dimension of the space of directions that points are moved. Every good geometry book proves that each isometry of euclidean nspace is a product of at most n+1 reflections and several more-advanced sources include Scherk’s theorem which identifies the minimal length of such a reflection factorization from the basic geometric attributes of the isometry under consideration [Sch50, Die71, ST89, Tay92]. The structure of the full set of minimal length reflection factorizations, on the other hand, does not appear to have been given an elementary treatment in the literature even though the proof only requires basic geometric tools. In this article we construct, for each isometry, an explicit combinatorial model encoding all of its minimal length reflection factorizations. The model is largely independent of the isometry chosen in that it only depends on whether or not some point is fixed and the dimension of the space of directions that points are moved. Analogous results for spherical isometries already exist and are easy to state: when w is an orthogonal linear transformation of R only fixing the origin, for example, there is a natural bijection between minimal length factorizations of w into reflections fixing the origin and complete flags of linear subspaces in R [BW02]. In other words, the structure of all such factorizations is encoded in the lattice of linear subspaces of R with one factorization for each maximal chain. We construct a Date: December 27, 2013. 1The only discussions of this issue that we have found in the literature use Wall’s parameterization of the orthogonal group and the main results are stated in terms of inclusions of nondegenerate subspaces under an asymmetric bilinear form derived from the original isometry [Tay92, Wal63].	amiga reflections;bilinear filtering;diffuse reflection;integer factorization;maximal set;reflection (computer graphics)	Noel Brady;Jon McCammond	2015	IJAC	10.1142/S0218196715400135	interval;reflection;euclidean group;point reflection;mathematical analysis;topology;hyperbolic space;isometry;isometry group;motion;lattice;translation;euclidean distance;euclidean plane isometry;congruence;mathematics;geometry;glide reflection;algebra	Theory	40.8564523116231	32.93723954812207	33508

Two algorithms are proposed based on directed graphs informing whether each pair of bits are related in the state transition: One tests two categories of degenerate synchronous additive stream ciphers, particularly for realistic stream ciphers with sparse transition equations; the other finds a recursive description of a given stream cipher. Specially, the latter algorithm has to balance the efficiency and the number of sequences for a recursive description, and a sufficient condition is given to test degeneracy based on the recursive description.	algorithm;cryptanalysis;degeneracy (graph theory);directed graph;list of algorithms;recursion (computer science);sparse matrix;state transition table;stream cipher;utility functions on indivisible goods	Lin Wang;Zhi Hu	2018	Fundam.

This paper presents constructions of partial difference sets in (Z_{p^r})^{2t} where p is any prime, and r and t are any positive integers. For the case where r 2 many of the partial difference sets are constructed in groups with parameters distinct from other known constructions, and the PDSs are nested. Another construction of Paley partial difference sets is given for the case when p is odd. The constructions make use of character theory and of the structure of the Galois ring GR(p^r, t), and in particular, the ring GR(p^r, t) \times GR(p^r, t). The paper concludes with some open related problems.		John B. Polhill	2002	Des.

Here, f(x) denotes an irreducible polynomial with integer coefficients with some necessary conditions imposed on it.

It always appears to be in competition with electronic computing. Moore's law and the advantages of digital over analog processing make pure electronics superior in almost every case. Optical computing uses come when the signal is already in the optical domain or when it is used to reduce the heat load in hybrid optical-electronic chips. I describe here work done with a number of bright opticists and logicians over the last four years that produces using optics logic that dissipates no energy and accommodates whatever bandwidth the input and output laser modulation affords. Moreover, we can show why electronics alone can never accomplish those important properties.		H.

In this paper we consider codes defined as modules over non commutative polynomial rings, removing therefore some of the constraints on the length of the codes defined as ideals. The notion of BCH codes can be extended to this new approach and the codes whose duals are also defined as modules can be characterized. We show that under some restriction, self dual module codes must be constacyclic ideal codes and found two non equivalent Euclidean self-dual [56, 28, 15]4 codes which improve the best previously known distance 14 for self-dual codes of this length over F4. 1 Coding with skew polynomial rings Starting from the finite field Fq and an automorphism θ of Fq, we define a ring structure on the set: R = Fq[X, θ] = {anX n + . . . + a1X + a0 | ai ∈ Fq and n ∈ N} . The addition in R is defined to be the usual addition of polynomials and the multiplication is defined by the basic rule X a = θ(a) X (a ∈ Fq) and extended to all elements of R by associativity and distributivity (cf. [1, 7, 8]). The ring R is a left and right Euclidean ring whose left and right ideals are principal [8]. In the following we denote Fq ⊂ Fq the fixed field of θ. 1.1 Ideal θ-codes In [4] we defined codes as ideals of quotient rings of R. If I = (f) is a two sided ideal of R, then, in analogy to classical cyclic codes, we associate to an element a(X) = an−1X n−1 + . . . + a1X + a0 in R/(f) the ‘word‘ a = (a0, a1, . . . , an−1) ∈ Fq . 1 Definition 1 (cf. [4]) Let f ∈ R be of degree n. If I = (f) is a two sided ideal of R, then an ideal θ-code C is a left ideal (g)/(f) ⊂ R/(f), where g ∈ R is a right divisor of f in R. If the order of θ divides n then, 1. If f = X + c with c ∈ Fq, then we call the ideal θ-code corresponding to the left ideal (g)/(X + c) ⊂ R/(X + c) an ideal θ-constacyclic code. 2. If f = X − 1 , then we call the ideal θ-code corresponding to the left ideal (g)/(X − 1) ⊂ R/(X − 1) an ideal θ-cyclic code. An ideal θ-cyclic code C has the following property ([3], Theorem 1) (a0, a1, . . . , an−1) ∈ C ⇒ (θ(an−1), θ(a0), θ(a1), . . . , θ(an−2)) ∈ C. If θ is not the identity, then the non commutative ring R is not a unique factorisation ring and there are much more right factors of f ∈ R than in the commutative case, leading to a huge number of linear codes that are not cyclic codes (cf. [3, 4]). Example. Let α be a generator of the multiplicative group of F4 and θ the Frobenius automorphism given by θ(a) = a. The polynomial X + α X + α is a right divisor of X − 1 ∈ F4[X, θ] so it generates a [4, 2]4 ideal θ-cyclic code. Note that there are seven different monic right factors of degree two of X − 1 in F4[X, θ] ([3], Example 2). In order to generate a two sided ideal of R, a monic polynomial f must be of the form X t f̃ where f̃ is a monic polynomial belonging to the center Fq[X ] of R, where m is the order of θ. If f is in the center of R, then we call the ideal θ-code, corresponding to the left ideal (g)/(f) ⊂ R/(f), an ideal θ-central code (cf [4]). The length of an ideal θ-code is determined by the degree of f , while the code itself is given by the generator matrix	bch code;cyclic code;degree (graph theory);difference quotient;generator matrix;matrix multiplication;monic polynomial;monoid factorisation;ore algebra;polynomial ring	Delphine Boucher;Felix Ulmer	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-10868-6_3	block code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;dot product;computer science;modular programming;linear code;mathematics;bch code;programming language;algebra	Theory	40.7587881604984	38.768642750308835	34259

However, correct VF codes need not be prefix free. Removing that constraint may offer the opportunity to build more efficient codes. Here, we come back to the almost instantaneous VF codes introduced by Yamamoto and Yokoo. They considered both single trees and multiple trees to perform the parsing of the source string. We show that, in some cases, their technique builds suboptimal codes. We propose correctives accordingly. We also propose a new, completely different technique based on dynamic programming that builds individually optimal dictionary trees.	code (cryptography);data dictionary;dynamic programming;parsing;tunstall coding	Danny Dubé;Fatma Haddad	2018	2018 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	10.1109/ISIT.2018.8437665	algorithm;discrete mathematics;dynamic programming;parsing;computer science;prefix	Arch	36.94321347709679	60.14557427581936	34402

Periods have an elegant mathematical structure and a wealth of applications [F. Mignosi and A. Restivo, Periodicity, Algebraic Combinatorics on Words, in: M. Lothaire (Ed.), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, pp. 237-274, 2002]. At the hearth of their theory, there are two Periodicity Lemmas: one due to Lyndon and Schutzenberger [The equation a^M=b^Nc^P in a free group, Michigan Math. J. 9 (1962) 289-298], referred to as the Weak Version, and the other due to Fine and Wilf [Uniqueness theorems for periodic functions, Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 16 (1965) 109-114]. In this paper, we investigate the notion of periodicity and the closely related one of repetition in connection with parameterized strings as introduced by Baker [Parameterized pattern matching: algorithms and applications, J. Comput. System Sci. 52(1) (1996) 28-42; Parameterized duplication in strings: algorithms and an application to software maintenance, SIAM J. Comput. 26(5) (1997) 1343-1362]. In such strings, the notion of pairwise match or ''equivalence'' of symbols is more relaxed than the usual one, in that it rests on some mapping, rather than identity, of symbols. It seems natural to try and extend notions of periods and periodicities to encompass parameterized strings. However, we know of no previous attempt in this direction. Our preliminary investigation yields results as follows. For periodicity, we get (a) a generalization of the Weak Version of the Periodicity Lemma for parameterized strings, showing that it is essential that the two mappings inducing the periodicity must commute; (b) a proof that an analogous of the Lemma by Fine and Wilf [Uniqueness theorems for periodic functions, Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 16 (1965) 109-114] cannot hold for parameterized strings, even if the mappings inducing the periodicity ''commute'', in a sense to be specified below; (c) a proof that parameterized strings over an alphabet of at least three letters may have a set of periods which differ from those of any binary string of the same length-whereby the parameterized analog of a classic result by Guibas and Odlyzko [String overlaps, pattern matching, and nontransitive games, J. Combin. Theory Ser. A 30 (1981) 183-208] cannot hold. We also derive necessary and sufficient conditions characterizing parameterized repetitions, which are patterns of length at least twice that of the period, and show how the notion of root differs from the standard case, and highlight some of the implications on extending algorithmic criteria previously adopted for string searching, detection of repetitions and the likes. Finally, as a corollary of our main results, we also show that binary parameterized strings behave much in the same way as non-parameterized ones with respect to periodicity and repetitions, while there is a substantial difference for strings over alphabets of at least three symbols.	quasiperiodicity	Alberto Apostolico;Raffaele Giancarlo	2008	Discrete Applied Mathematics	10.1016/j.dam.2006.11.017	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;computer science;mathematics;symbol;algorithmics;algorithm;algebraic combinatorics	Theory	36.89818864075502	37.255096569065145	34496

For the first time, a sampling-number dependence of reconstructed Weibull slope is reported. Through both experimental studies and Monte Carlo simulation, we confirm the original concept of the reconstructed distribution to represent a distribution as if no thickness/spacing variation as advanced by Roussel et al. [1], by using gate oxides with very tight thickness control. Despite this success, it is unclear whether this methodology can be generally applied to complicated systems such as BEOL and MOL dielectrics with large variation. By comparing two different cases of slightly and highly non-uniform dielectrics, we show that the use of small sampling number can give a false impression of the validity of this reconstruction methodology. Using detailed in-die TBD distributions across entire wafers with extraordinary statistics, we reveal the underlying in-die distributions being bimodal and non-Weibull, and following non-Poisson area scaling, which can be completely masked if not using very large sampling numbers. We demonstrate that reconstruction methodology and time-dependent clustering model yield comparable results when the assumptions of reconstruction methodology can be satisfied. In comparison, time-dependent clustering model is shown to be advantageous due to its simplicity in its implementation and its predictability using small statistics.	back end of line;circuit complexity;cluster analysis;front end of line;image scaling;monte carlo method;sampling (signal processing);simulation;slope number;spatial variability;thickness (graph theory)	Ernest Wu;James H.

This method includes a contraction process as well as an expansion process. The contraction process has ( N 3) contraction stages. To reduce the data-transfer operations, ( N 5 ) vacancies are reserved beforehand in the array which is used to store the probabilities of symbols. At each Contraction stage, the number of the symbols whose probabilities are equal to or less than the sum of the two least probabilities is stored and named as the expansion index. Under the contraction process, the code lengths of the original symbols and those at each contraction stage increase monotonically. According to the expansion indices and these characteristics, the expansion process generates all the code lengths represented by A( I ) , A ( 2 ) , . . ., A(Y) and uses this data set to construct all the code words, which are represented by monotonically increasing values, where A(J) is the number of J-b code words, and Y is the maximum length. Since the proposed method gives a monotonically increasing code both in code length and in code value, its implementation becomes easy in VLSI technology, in microprocessor-based systems, or in software programming. The proposed Huffman-type code has the same average rate as the the Huffman code and is easy to generate. Thus, it is very useful in time-variant systems for information trans-	code generation (compiler);code word;computer programming;huffman coding;microprocessor;very-large-scale integration	Ming-I Lu;Chang-Fuu Chen	1990	IEEE Trans.

Recently, different structures of local repair groups have been proposed in the definitions of repair locality. In this paper, the concept of regenerating set is introduced to characterize the local repair groups. A definition of locality r(δ-1) (i.e., locality r with repair tolerance δ - 1) under the most general structure of regenerating sets is given. All previously studied locality notions turn out to be special cases of this definition. Furthermore, three representative notions of locality proposed before are reinvestigated under the framework of regenerating sets, and their respective upper bounds on the minimum distance are reproved in a uniform and brief form. Additionally, a tighter distance bound is derived for the square code which is a class of linear codes with locality r(2) and high information rate, and an explicit code construction attaining the optimal distance bound is obtained.	clustered file system;erasure code;linear code;locality of reference	Anyu Wang;Zhifang Zhang	2014	2014 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2014.6875178	block code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;theoretical computer science;linear code;mathematics	Arch	35.96808585366754	58.25547003469901	34859

Given a netlist and its placement from a placer, we formally define a class of netlist transformations that produce different netlists from the given netlist but have the same Half-Perimeter Wire Length (HPWL). Furthermore, the optimal HPWL value of the new netlists is no less than that of the original netlist. By applying our transformations and re-executing the placer, we can interpret any deviation in HPWL as a lower bound to the deviation from the optimal HPWL value. Such deviation is a measure of suboptimality. Using these transformations, the suboptimality of several existing academic and industrial placers is studied on the IBM benchmarks. Our results show that current placers are sub-optimal for zero-change transformations with deviations in HPWL by up to 32% on the IBM (version 1) benchmarks. The specific nature of our transformations also pinpoints possible directions for improvement in existing placers.	benchmark (computing);netlist;perimeter	Andrew B.

243f2738efa10c280b7f82b8e43c894464c68b2a	on an algorithm for testing t4 solvability of max-plus interval systems		Max-plus algebra is the algebraic structure in which classical addition and multiplication are replaced by a⊕b = max{a, b} and a⊗b = a+b, respectively. Each system of linear equation in max-plus algebra we can write in the matrix form A⊗ x = b, where A and b are matrix and vector of suitable size. If we replace the matrix elements with matrix interval A = [A,A] and vector elements by vector interval b = [b, b], we get an interval system of linear equations. We can define several types of solvability of interval systems in max-plus algebra. In this paper, we shall deal with one of them, the so called T5 solvability. We give the algorithm which answers the question whether the given interval system is T5 solvable or not.	algorithm	Helena Mysková	2012	Kybernetika		discrete mathematics;mathematics;mathematical optimization;iterative method;algebraic structure;algorithm;system of linear equations;max-plus algebra;matrix (mathematics);linear equation;multiplication;mathematical analysis	Logic	46.51836118948423	36.66632770829236	35337

Equivalently, a real is c.e. if it is left computable in the sense that L(α) = {q ∈ Q : q ≤ α} is a computably enumerable set. The natural field formed by the c.e. reals turns out to be the field formed by the collection of reals of the form α− β where α and β are c.e. reals. While c.e. reals can only be found in the c.e. degrees, Zheng has proven that there are ∆2 degrees that are not even n-c.e. for any n and yet contain d.c.e. reals. In this paper we will prove that every ω-c.e. degree contains a d.c.e. real, but there are ω+1-c.e. degrees and, hence ∆2 degrees, containing no d.c.e. real. ∗Downey is partially supported by the New Zealand Marsden Fund.

In fact, they consider the additive group of the finite field GF(q), q a prime power, as the underlying group for the GP-LDPC code construction and since when q is a prime, the author's code construction method coincides with that of quasi-cyclic array LDPC codes, they call their codes, generalised array LDPC (GA-LDPC) codes. First, they prove that, like array LDPC codes, GA-LDPC codes are quasi-cyclic codes. Then, they analyse the girth of GA-LDPC codes in a way similar to that for array LDPC codes and introduce some shortened GA-LDPC codes with girths 8, 10 and 12. For many values of g, J and L, the lengths of (J, L)-regular shortened GA-LDPC codes of girth g and rate at least 1 − J/L, constructed in this study, are smaller than the lengths of (J, L)-regular LDPC codes of girth g and rate at least 1 − J/L, constructed in the literature. Also, simulation results show that GA-LDPC codes perform well with the iterative message-passing decoding.	low-density parity-check code	Reza Sobhani	2014	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2013.1179	block code;reed–muller code;concatenated error correction code;turbo code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;low-density parity-check code;fountain code;theoretical computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;bcjr algorithm;tornado code;linear code;hamming code;expander code;luby transform code;mathematics;forward error correction;raptor code;berlekamp–welch algorithm;error floor;group code;reed–solomon error correction	HPC	41.40388971099464	57.53474476272593	35695

We illustrate the power of this framework by constructing explicit codes that attain the smallest amount of data to be read and downloaded for repair among all existing solutions for three important settings: (a) codes meeting the constraints of being maximum distance separable (MDS), high-rate, and having a small number of substripes, (b) binary MDS codes for all parameters where binary MDS codes exist, and (c) MDS codes with the smallest repair-locality. In addition, we show how to use this framework to enable efficient repair of parity nodes in existing codes that are constructed to address the repair of only the systematic nodes. The basic idea behind this framework is to take multiple stripes of existing codes and add carefully designed functions of the data of one stripe to other stripes. Typical savings in the amount of data read and downloaded during repair are 25% to 50% depending on the choice of the system parameters.	clustered file system;code;download;piggybacking (security)	K.

1a12e337d987ffa61e7ed32027bc60b79ba12734	some results on finite fields		In the study of perfect sequences, use of trace functions in finite fields has been a common technique, dating back to Singer’s classical examples of msequences. Many variations of Singer’s theme have been the topic of research by many mathematicians during the last few decades. In all these investigations, expressing the underlying function as a polynomial whose coefficients are from the prime subfield has been a main problem. Explicit answers require the use of Stickelberger’s congruence of Gauss sums. Using elementary methods, we provide a simple result along these lines. The following is well-known: Let f : F p ¿ → F p be any function. Then f ( x )=∑ k=0 p−2 α k x ∈ Fp d[x ] We prove a finer version of the above result: Let p be an odd prime. Let f ( x )∈ Fp d [ x ] . Let deg f (x )=r . Suppose r< p −1∧f (α )∈F p for each α∈F p ¿ . Then f ( x )∈ Fp [ x ] .	coefficient;congruence of squares;polynomial	James Hufford	2015	ACM Comm.

They have application in DNA computing, in DNA microarray technologies and as molecular bar codes. The combinatorial conditions considered are (i) minimum Hamming distance d, (ii) fixed GC content and, in some cases (iii) minimum distance d between any codeword and the reverse Watson-Crick complement of any codeword. The problem is to find DNA codes with the maximum number of codewords. In this paper the construction of DNA codes is studied from an algorithmic perspective. Four local search algorithms are developed and combined in a variable neighbourhood search framework. The algorithm has been run extensively. Over 254 problems considered, it was able to match or improve the best known lower bounds in 180 cases, with 52 new bests.		Roberto Montemanni;Derek H. Smith	2008	J. Math. Model.

Reducing the burden of centralized relocation paradigms by the distributed movement models comes at the price of unpleasant oscillations and excessive movements due to nodes' local and limited interactions. If the nodes' careless movements in the distributed relocation models are not properly addressed, their power will be exhausted. Therefore, in order to exert proper amount of virtual radial/angular push/pull forces among the nodes, a fuzzy logic relocation model is proposed and by considering linear combination of the presented performance metric(s)(i.e. coverage, uniformity, and average movement), its parameters are locally and globally tuned by particle swarm optimization(PSO). In order to tune fuzzy parameters locally and globally, PSO benefits respectively from nodes' neighbours within different ranges and all the given deployed area. Performance of locally and globally tuned fuzzy relocation models is compared with one another in addition to the distributed self-spreading algorithm (DSSA). It is shown that by applying PSO to the linear combinations of desired metric(s) to obtain tuned fuzzy parameters, the relocation model outperforms and/or is comparable to DSSA in one or more performance metric(s).	algorithm;angularjs;centralized computing;circuit complexity;computation;distributed system security architecture;fuzzy logic;interaction;iteration;mathematical optimization;particle swarm optimization;phase-shift oscillator;programming paradigm;radial (radio);relocation (computing);swift (programming language)	Ali Rafiei;Yashar Maali;Mehran Abolhasan;Daniel Robert Franklin;Farzad Safaei;Stephen Smith	2013	2013 IEEE 78th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2013.6692070	fuzzy logic;control engineering;mathematical optimization;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence	Robotics	32.958408029118296	50.19312442120776	36040

However, we find an example of a finitely generated solvable group of derived length 3 which admits a finitely generated metabelian subgroup without the bounded packing property. In this example the subgroup is a retract also. Thus we obtain a negative answer to Problem 2.27 of the above paper. On the other hand, we show that polycyclic subgroups of solvable groups satisfy the bounded packing property.	decision problem;set packing	Pranab Sardar	2015	IJAC	10.1142/S0218196715500253	locally finite group;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;solvable group;mathematics;algebra	Logic	38.83286971629209	32.70004608602921	36074

Such approach provides many advantages over traditional ECOC codings. First, codewords are generated in an algebraic way without requiring any selection of rows and columns of the coding matrix. Second, the decoding phase can be improved by exploiting the algebraic properties of the code. In particular, it is possible to detect and recover possible errors produced by the dichotomizers through an iterative mechanism. Some experiments have been accomplished with the focus on the parity-check matrix used to define the codewords of the LDPC code, so as to determine how the code parameters influence the performance of the proposed approach.	low-density parity-check code	Claudio Marrocco;Francesco Tortorella	2014		10.1007/978-3-662-44415-3_46	concatenated error correction code;low-density parity-check code;theoretical computer science;machine learning;linear code;mathematics;algorithm	ML	41.73620818523476	58.25306920607916	36193

For the first time, we are able to exhibit running times for these operations that are almost linear, without any overhead exponential in the number of variables. As a further application, we show that, from the complexity viewpoint, Charlap, Coley and Robbins’ approach to elliptic curve point counting can be competitive with the better known approach due to Elkies.	algorithm;overhead (computing);time complexity	Adrien Poteaux;Éric Schost	2013	J.

The symmetrized tensor powers of a module include the familiar symmetric and exterior powers as well as some less well known symmetrizations. There is a symmetrized tensor power associated with each representation of a symmetric group; the symmetric and exterior powers correspond to one-dimensional representations. Our method applies to principal symmetrized tensor powers (defined in Section 2); these include all symmetrizations that correspond to irreducible representations of symmetric groups. This paper can be viewed as a generalization of Ryba (1990): the earlier work described a method for computing condensed modules obtained from the exterior powers of a module. In the calculation of modular character tables and the determination of p-modular invariants of finite groups it is important to understand the module structure of small tensor powers of modular representations. Our paper provides an efficient method that gives such information. Throughout this paper, we write G, F , W , and p to denote a finite group, a finite field, an FG-module, and the characteristic of F , respectively. We think of W as a “small” FG-module, in the sense that we know and can calculate with matrices giving the action of generators of G on W . We suppose that H is a p′-subgroup of G that acts monomially on W . We shall refer to H as the condensation subgroup; the condensed modules that we obtain will be fixed point spaces of H. We will consider a fixed tensor power V = ⊗n W . Even for small values of n, the module V is likely to be much too large to compute with directly. Our method allows us to analyze the structure of otherwise inaccessibly large tensor powers. For example, in Section 8, we discuss our computations of the condensed symmetrizations of the fourth tensor power of the natural 133-dimensional representation (Ryba and Wilson, 1994) of HN over a field of characteristic 5. This tensor power is 312 900 721 dimensional. However, the condensed symmetrized modules that we obtain are small enough to analyze with the Meat-Axe. In Lux and Ryba (2001) we make essential use of these particular condensed modules in our complete determination of the 5-modular character table of	computation;fixed point (mathematics);irreducibility;job control (unix)	Alexander J.

Each subsemigroup is characterized by a certain collection of parameters. Using our description, we determine the regular , simple and bisimple subsemigroups of B. Finally we describe algorithms for obtaining the parameters from the generating set.	algorithm;free monoid	Luís Descalço;Nikola Ruskuc	2005	IJAC	10.1142/S0218196705002098	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;bicyclic molecule;mathematics;automatic transmission;semigroup;algebra	NLP	38.00994635142797	33.551730533445465	36453

For every k, we derive upper and lower bounds for the chromatic number of ιk(G) in terms of that of G. In the case where G is a transitive tournament, the exact value of the chromatic number of ιk(G) has been determined by [H.G. Yeh, X. Zhu, Resource-sharing system scheduling and circular chromatic number, Theoret. Comput. Sci. 332 (2005) 447–460]. We use the latter result in conjunction with categorical properties of adjoint functors to derive the following consequence. For every integer l, there exists a directed path Ql of algebraic length l which admits homomorphisms into every directed graph of chromatic number at least 4.

d7b07240fada19d147caf118770a6480f59a7c78	recurrence relations for orthogonal rational functions	65d30;41a55;65d32	It is well known that members of families of polynomials, that are orthogonal with respect to an inner product determined by a nonnegative measure on the real axis, satisfy a three-term recursion relation. Analogous recursion formulas are available for orthogonal Laurent polynomials with a pole at the origin. This paper investigates recursion relations for orthogonal rational functions with arbitrary prescribed real or complex conjugate poles. The number of terms in the recursion relation is shown to be related to the structure of the orthogonal rational functions.	apache axis;approximation;gaussian quadrature;gauss–kronrod quadrature formula;least squares;linear algebra;paco nathan;polynomial;recurrence relation;recursion	Miroslav S.

The process begins with select vertices as colored, and the remaining vertices can become colored under a specific color change rule. The goal is to find a minimum set of vertices such that after iteratively applying the rule, all of the vertices become colored (i.e., a minimum zero forcing set). Of particular interest is the propagation time of a chosen set which is the number of steps the rule must be applied in order to color all the vertices of a graph. We give a purely linear algebraic interpretation of zero forcing: Find a set of vertices S such that for any weighted adjacency matrix A, whenever Ax = 0, the entirety of of x can be recovered using only xS, the entries corresponding to S. The key here is that S must be chosen before A. In this light, we are able to give a linear algebraic interpretation of the propagation time: Any error in xS effects the error of x exponentially in the propagation time. This error can be quantitatively measured using newly defined zero forcing-related parameters, the error polynomial vector and the variance polynomial vector. In this sense, the quality of two zero forcing sets can objectively be compared even if the sets are the same size and their propagation time is the same.

0e52cb00e4702c0a290d617d409f9f3ac07b2062	on zigzag functions and related objects in new metric		For any two binary vectors x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn) and y = (y1, y2, . . . , yn) in F2 , define the sets δ(x, y) = {i : xi 6= yi} and sup(x) = {i : xi 6= 0}. Denote the size of a set A with |A|. Then the Hamming distance between the binary vectors x and y is equal to d(x, y) = |δ(x, y)| and the Hamming weight of x is wt(x) = | sup(x)|. Instead of using the Hamming distance d(x, y) and norm wt(x), we will work with the metric defined by δ(x, y) and the corresponding norm sup(x). In this way, many definitions and properties will be expressed by sets instead of numbers, which in fact corresponds to the cardinality of certain sets. For this purpose monotone increasing and monotone decreasing sets are considered. Consequently, this leads to a better description of the properties. This approach has already been applied in [12] to codes (e.g. minimum distance, generator and parity-check matrix, minimal codeword, etc.) and in [3] to Boolean functions (e.g. resilient, with propagation characteristics, etc.). In this paper we will investigate the properties of zigzag functions. The zigzag functions, introduced in [2] and used for efficient oblivious transfer in [14] were later generalized to s-zigzag functions for 2 ≤ s ≤ n in [8]. Zigzag functions are related to self-intersecting codes and orthogonal arrays as it is shown in [2] and [18]. We generalize the notion of zigzag functions and prove a connection with a subclass of ∆-resilient functions, introduced in [3]. This new definition results in a better understanding of the properties of zigzag functions and provides a better insight in the space defined by the new metric.	code word;hamming distance;hamming weight;oblivious transfer;parity-check matrix;software propagation;window function;monotone	An Braeken;Ventzislav Nikov;Svetla Nikova	2006	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive			Theory	39.19161319208283	52.967427576482734	37206

Considering the case where the acting torus T has codimension one, we describe T -invariant Weil and Cartier divisors and provide formulae for calculating global sections, intersection numbers, and Euler characteristics. As an application, we use divisors on these socalled T -varieties to define new evaluation codes called T -codes. We find estimates on their minimum distance using intersection theory. This generalizes the theory of toric codes and combines it with AG codes on curves. As the simplest application of our general techniques we look at codes on ruled surfaces coming from decomposable vector bundles. Already this construction gives codes that are better than the related product code. Further examples show that we can improve these codes by constructing more sophisticated T -varieties. These results suggest to look further for good codes on T -varieties.	euler;polyhedral;universal product code	Nathan Owen Ilten;Hendrik Süß	2010	J. Symb.

Finding a best polynomial L-approximation with real coefficients is an easy exercise about orthogonal projections. However, truncating the coefficients to floating-point numbers, which is needed for further computations, makes the approximation way worse. Hence, we study the problem of computing best approximations under the constraint that coefficients are floating-point numbers. We show that the corresponding problem is NP-hard, by reduction to the CVP problem. We investigate the practical behaviour of exact and approximate algorithms for this problem. The conclusion is that it is possible in a short amount of time to obtain a relative or absolute best L-approximation. The main applications are for large dimension, as a preliminary step of finding L∞-approximations and for functions with large variations, for which relative best approximation is by far more interesting than absolute.

We introduce a new parameter, r, representing the class of the hypercube. When r = 1, this provides the usual definition of a hypercube and when d = 2 and r = t = 1 these hypercubes are Latin squares. If d ≥ 2r, then the notion of orthogonality is also inherited from the usual definition of hypercubes. This work deals with constructions of class r hypercubes and presents bounds on the number of mutually orthogonal class r hypercubes. We also give constructions of sets of mutually orthogonal hypercubes when n is a prime power.	graph coloring;grid network;olap cube;shannon (unit)	John T. Ethier;Gary L.

9b39b03dac44b06da66ebd7102a105e585b8332a	digital parametric testing	thesis or dissertation;kb thesis scanning project 2015	As minimum geometries of VLSI processes continue to shrink there have been two main effects on the field of parametric test. Firstly, structures must be able to characterise these smaller geometries and secondly the space for test structures has become more limited due to the requirement for them to he located in the scribe channel. The work of this thesis investigates methods of increasing the efficiency of test structure implementation to alleviate these problems. This work has demonstrated SPICE parameter extraction from test transistors accessed via a digitally addressed multiplexer: firstly using test circuits, to analyse pass transistor effects, then on a test chip using multiplexed access. The technique allows SPICE parameters to be extracted from transistor arrays with a large saving in the number of probe pads and hence overall silicon area. Digital misalignment structures have been implemented for the characterisation of small geometry processes. Use of such structures is demonstrated in this thesis using both a shift register output and a novel diudc vernier' scheme. One of the main drawbacks of using shift register structures has been the requirement for a large amount of functional circuitry. The diode vernier introduced in this thesis is a simply designed structure that can be easily tested with standard parametric test equipment and requires only one diode per test structure element. Finally, a digital process control chip has been fabricated to integrate the ideas presented in this thesis. This uses multiplexers to access both test transistors and diode vernier structures. It demonstrates the feasibility of using a digital approach to parametric test chip design which has the potential to signficantly reduce the area required for test structures. iv Acknowledgements Firstly I would like to thank my supervisor Dr A.J.

Massey and Sain (1968), Sain and Massey (1969), Brockett and Mesarovic (1965), and Forney (1970) have all dealt with invertibil i ty conditions for linear systems. In this highly s tructured setting one can obtain quite detailed and explicit invertibili ty conditions. At the other structural extreme, Olson (1970) has obtained invertibil i ty results for general finite state machines. Of course the results in this genera! setting are not nearly as detailed as the linear results. Our work falls in between these structural extremes. Brockett and Willsky (1972, 1974) and Willsky (1973a) have introduced a class of finite state systems that evolve homomorphical ly on finite groups. As their results indicate, this class of systems, although much broader than the class of linear sequential	coding theory;dynamical system;finite-state machine;forney algorithm;genera;linear system	Alan S.

Two Hadamard matrices are called equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by some sequence of row and column permutations and negations. To identify the equivalence of two Hadamard matrices by a complete search is known to be an NP hard problem when n increases. In this paper, a new algorithm for detecting inequivalence of two Hadamard matrices is proposed, which is more sensitive than those known in the literature and which has a close relation with several measures of uniformity. As an application, we apply the new algorithm to verify the inequivalence of the known 60 inequivalent Hadamard matrices of order 24; furthermore, we show that there are at least 382 pairwise inequivalent Hadamard matrices of order 36. The latter is a new discovery.	algorithm;circuit complexity;fast walsh–hadamard transform;hadamard transform;np-hardness;sensor;turing completeness	Kai-Tai Fang;Gennian Ge	2004	Math.

dc8f6062354acfdd6d95345b569ee86c4b45d521	generalization of the graph center concept, and derived topological centric indexes	indexation	6 z The concept of topological center is generalized for any connected acyclic or cyclic graph on the basis of the topological distance matrix using four criteria in a specified order. The center point@) provide(s): (1) the smallest distance to any other vertex; (2) the smallest sum of distances to all other vertexes; (3) the smallest number of times the maximum distance occurs in the distance code, and (4) constancy on repeating criteria (1)-(3) to the pseudocenter graph containing only the vertexes selected by the previous criteria and their incident edges. Two partition schemes of the graph vertexes are proposed: the classical partitions, based on the above four criteria in turn, and the generalized partitions based primarily on the distance to the polycenter vertex (or vertexes, respectively) and secondarily on the above criteria. Topological indexes based on each of these partitions are devised, making use either of a quadratic formula (8) or of Shannon's information function (9). The most sophisticated topological indexes also take into account the order of numbers in the partition by means of Muirhead's scheme. The new centric indexes may be used for topological correlations, for estimating the topological shape of isomeric chemical structures, and for use in coding and computer processing of chemical information.	cheminformatics;computer programming;directed acyclic graph;distance matrix;emoticon;graph (discrete mathematics);graph center;quadratic formula;shannon (unit);topological derivative;topological sorting;vertex (geometry)	Danail Bonchev;Alexandru T.

The task is to distinguish Hermitian and Non-Hermitian matrices. The quantum circuit is constructed to accumulate the elements of a learning set and with use of Hamming distance and some Hamiltonian designed for so-called quantum summing operation it is able to distinguish if a tested element fits to the pattern from the learning set.

Whether a code is good or not for error detection (in the technical sense) depends on the structure of the code. For some combinations of the main parameters length, size, and minimum distance, all code are good and for some other combinations all are ugly (stronger than not good). The purpose of this paper is to give bounds on the parameters for codes that are not good for error detection. In particular, it is shown that if the minimum distance is below some bound, which depends on the length and size of the code as well as a lower bound on the number of codewords of minimum distance, then the code is ugly and, hence, not good for error detection.	code (cryptography);code word;error detection and correction	Irina Naydenova;Torleiv Kløve	2010	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2009.2039044	low-density parity-check code;error detection and correction;theoretical computer science;cyclic code;linear code;hamming code;mathematics;locally testable code;upper and lower bounds;informatics;error exponent;algorithm;statistics	Theory	39.47184302887082	56.92992947927232	38436

Dislocation defects can cross the PN junction of a transistor/diode and contribute to leakage related failures. The extraction of dislocation defects from layout information is very difficult. We propose a methodology that accepts a schematic (netlist) of the AMS design and generates a list of dislocation defects by identifying the hierarchical net names of each defect. The methodology parses the schematic (netlist) and locates dislocation defects according to pre-determined rules. The cross section of different devices from the design manual of a process technology are studied and the possible dislocation spots related to PN junctions are listed in a rule file. This methodology is applied to five AMS IC products and a considerable amount of simulation time can be saved by truncating the defect list to the extracted dislocation susceptible spots.	cross section (geometry);diode;mixed-signal integrated circuit;netlist;p–n junction;schematic;simulation;software bug;spectral leakage;transistor;truncation;verilog-ams	Nivesh Rai;Hamidreza Hashempour;Yizi Xing;Bram Kruseman;Said Hamdioui	2011	2011 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems	10.1109/DFT.2011.21	reliability engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;integrated circuit;dislocation;cross section;integrated circuit layout;engineering drawing;schematic	EDA	24.805966835621412	56.16728286486861	38538

The multiple-access channel (MAC) that is used in the TANMAS is a discrete-time noiseless real adder channel used without feedback with N real or binary inputs. Each input may be affected by an unknown, slowly varying channel gain and by an unknown, slowly varying channel offset. A set of N codes is constructed such that the sum of codewords of any known set of T or less active users is uniquely decodable. The sum rate of the codes approaches one from above if the input alphabet of the MAC is binary, and it approaches one from below if the input symbols are real numbers. For the case when the set of active users is unknown. For the case when the set of active users is unknown, it is shown that this set can be identified uniquely (in addition to unique decodability) provided that at most T/2 users are active simultaneously. The sum rate is then reduced to 1/2, which is approached from above and from below, respectively, for binary and for real channel inputs. A simple decoding algorithm which operates over the reals is given for the case when the set of active users is known. It is pointed out that one of the applications of the given codes is in hybrid multiple-access systems that use both multiple-access coding and collision resolution. >	code	Peter Mathys	1990	IEEE Trans.

These are called PN^2 sequences. PN^2 sequences are generated by clocking a PN sequence generator at the l's of a PN sequence. The PN^2 sequence is 1 when the generator output makes a transition and is 0 otherwise. It is shown that PN^2 sequences have period N^2 if the PN sequence generators have period N . The density of l's is shown to approach 1/4 for large N .

We present an algorithm that uses an integral basis for computing L(D) for a suitably chosen D. The advantage of an integral basis is that it contains all the necessary information about the singularities, so once the integral basis is known the L(D) algorithm does not need work with the singularities anymore. If the degree of C is odd, or more generally, if any odd degree rational divisor on C is known then we show how to construct a rational point on C 2. In such cases a rational parametrization, which means deened without algebraic extensions, of C 2 can be obtained. In the remaining cases a parametrization of C 2 deened over a quadratic algebraic extension can be computed. A parametrization of C is obtained by composing the parametrization of C 2 with the inverse of the morphism g.	algebraic equation;algorithm;degree (graph theory);genus (mathematics);linear algebra	Mark van Hoeij	1997	J.

During the last 70 years, no new skew Hadamard difference sets were found. It was conjectured that there are no further examples of skew Hadamard difference sets. This conjecture was proved to be true for the cyclic case in 1954, and further progress in favor of this conjecture was made in the past 50 years. However, the conjecture remains open until today. In this paper, we present a family of new perfect nonlinear (also called planar) functions, and construct a family of skew Hadamard difference sets using these perfect nonlinear functions. We show that some of the skew Hadamard difference sets presented in this paper are inequivalent to the Paley–Hadamard difference sets. These new examples of skew Hadamard difference sets discovered 70 years after the Paley construction disprove the longstanding conjecture on skew Hadamard difference sets.

Let $S$ be a minimal zero-sum sequence with elements over $G$, i.e., the sum of elements in $S$ is zero, but no proper nontrivial subsequence of $S$ has sum zero. We call $S$ is unsplittable, if there do not exist $g$ in $S$ and $x,y \in G$ such that $g=x+y$ and $Sg^{-1}xy$ is also a minimal zero-sum sequence. In this paper we show that if $S$ is an unsplittable minimal zero-sum sequence of length $|S|= \frac{p-1}{2}$, then $S=g^{\frac{p-11}{2}}(\frac{p+3}{2}g)^4(\frac{p-1}{2}g)$ or $g^{\frac{p-7}{2}}(\frac{p+5}{2}g)^2(\frac{p-3}{2}g)$. Furthermore, if $S$ is a minimal zero-sum sequence with $|S| \ge \frac{p-1}{2}$, then $\ind(S) \leq 2$.

In particular, it is proven that two families do not belong to the completed class M. The latter result gives a positive answer to an open problem whether the class H of bent functions introduced by Dillon in his thesis of 1974 differs from the completed class M.	bent function;dillon's rolling western;leander	Lilya Budaghyan;Claude Carlet;Tor Helleseth;Alexander Kholosha;Sihem Mesnager	2012	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2012.2206557	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;information theory;bent function;mathematics;boolean function;algebra	Theory	41.71958166299604	41.33249902308337	39385

Rather than define what a set is, we assume you have the “ordinary, human, intuitive (and frequently erroneous) understanding”1 of what a set is. 1 Paul Halmos, Naive Set Theory, Springer–Verlag, NY 1974. Sets have elements, often called members. The elements of a set may be flies, beavers, words, numbers, sets, vectors, . . . If x is some object and S is a set, we write x ∈ S if x is an element of S and x 6∈ S if x is not a member of S. For us, the most important property a set S has is this: if x is an object, then either x ∈ S or x 6∈ S, but not both. The sets N, Z, Q, and R are well-known to you, though you may not know their names. The set of natural numbers is denoted by N, Math 582, Introduction to Set Theory, provides a rigorous treatment of N. and its elements are the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . Note that if n, m ∈ N, then n + m ∈ N; that is, N is closed under addition. However, N is not closed under subtraction. For example, (4− 5) 6∈ N. To overcome this inconvenience we consider Z, the set of integers, which has as its The symbol Z is derived from Zahlen, the German word for numbers. elements the numbers 0, ±1, ±2, ±3, . . . While Z is closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication, it is not closed under division. never divide by zero. For example, (−23)/57 6∈ Z. To surmount this difficulty, we form the set of rational numbers, Q. Intuitively, Q is the set of all numbers that In Math 412, Introduction to Modern Algebra, Q is rigorously defined. can be expressed as a fraction n/m with n ∈ Z and m ∈ N. While closed under multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction, Q is missing important numbers like √ 2. There are many ways to overApproximately 1.41, √ 2 is the ratio of a square’s diagonal to one of its sides.

In many ways, these numbers mimic the classical Stirling numbers of the second kind which play a similar role in the integral powers of the classical second-order Laguerre differential expression. In a recent paper, Andrews and Littlejohn gave a combinatorial interpretation of the Legendre-Stirling numbers. In this paper, we establish several properties of the Legendre-Stirling numbers; as with the Stirling numbers of the second kind, they have interesting generating functions and recurrence relations. Moreover, there are some surprising and intriguing results relating these numbers to some classical results in algebraic number theory.	let expression;linear algebra;recurrence relation	George E.

The proposal is based on a state-of-the-art immune-inspired algorithm, the cob-aiNet[C], which is employed to solve a combinatorial optimization problem - associated with a minimal entropy configuration - adopting a Michigan-like population structure. The simulation results reveal that the strategy is capable of reaching a performance similar to that of standard methods for lower-dimensional instances with the advantage of also handling scenarios with an elevated number of sources.	independent component analysis	Daniel G.

The basic memory module of an internally-clocked system is the DFLOP, the outputs of which are fully protected from metastability-generated anomalies. As a result, the only input constraint on an internally clocked system is a minimum pulse width corresponding to the frequency of the internal clock. In an internally clocked system, a clock event is not generated until all DFLOPs have resolved into a logically defined state. Because the period of the internal clock depends only on propagation delay through the components of the system, the clock always operates at a maximum possible frequency. Several internally clocked systems, involving both static and dynamic logic, are analyzed by using PSPICE simulations and the results of some real time tests are reported for comparison purposes. The operation characteristics of the DFLOP are analyzed at the component level, and system level comparisons are made with previous work. With submicron CMOS designs using dynamic logic, the internal frequencies of EAIC systems are predicted to exceed 300 MHz with throughputs of less than four ns.

To this end we regard several deening properties of convolutional codes and study the classes of subspaces deened by each of those properties alone. It turns out that these superclasses of the class of convolutional codes either achieve no better distance to rate ratio or are susceptible to an unavoidable innnite error propagation. We consider convolutional codes as subspaces of the space GF(q) ! of all seminiinite words over GF(q) provided with the metric deened as follows (;) = (0 , if = ; maxf1=n : (n) 6 = (n)g , if 6 = : A subspace L of GF(q) ! is a linear subset of GF(q) ! which is closed in the topology deened by the metric. Following Forney F1] a convolutional encoder is a k-input n-output time-invariant nite-state linear sequential circuit. All these properties are in some sense transferred to the set of all seminiinite output sequences , that is, to the convolutional code. Another important property of convolutional codes is an eeect which Forney F2] calls remerging to the all zero path. If a subspace L of GF(q) ! does not possess this property, any error-correcting decoder for L is susceptible to an unavoidable innnite error propagation, that is, decoding errors in a nite initial part of the received sequence can force the decoder to make further on an innnite number of decoding errors. We list these properties below using the following notations:	convolutional code;encoder;error detection and correction;forney algorithm;propagation of uncertainty;sequential logic;software propagation;time-invariant system	Ludwig Staiger	1983	Information and Control	10.1016/S0019-9958(83)80034-5	concatenated error correction code;turbo code;formal language;discrete mathematics;convolutional code;biological classification;propagation of uncertainty;theoretical computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;linear code;mathematics;rate ratio;error floor;code;algorithm;statistics	AI	40.470770400722074	58.2957163157687	40153

We show that projective codes of reasonable length admit only projective extensions. Thus, we are able to prove the maximality of many known linear codes. At the same time our results sharply limit the possibilities for constructing long nonlinear codes. We also show that certain short linear codes are maximal. The methods here may be just as interesting as the results. They are based on the Bruen-Silverman model of linear codes (see [1, 2, 9] and [15]) as well as the theory of Rédei blocking sets first introduced in [8].	blocking (computing);brian silverman;linear code;maximal set;nonlinear system	Tim L.

It can be shown that a subspace is a cyclic code if and only TONG: CORRECTION OF SYCHRONIZATION ERRORS if it is an ideal in the algebra of polynomials modulo Z” 1. The generator g(x) of the principal ideal is known as the generator polynomial of the cyclic code. Thus, each code word C(X) of a cyclic code must contain g(x) as a factor or c(z) = 0 mod g(x) in the algebra A,. A b-burst error-correcting cyclic code corrects all bursts of the form b(x) = x*(ro + .* * + r,-lxc-*) mod Z$ 1 where r, # 0, T,-~ # 0, 0 < c 5 b, and s < n. We call a burst b(x) an end-around burst if s + c 1 2 n. Such end-around bursts are mathematically equivalent to the b(x) and therefore are also correctable. However, in general, the end-around bursts are not considered as likely to occur as the ordinary burst (s + c 1 < n); thus, there is little need to correct such bursts. We are going to use the end-around burst error patterns to detect and correct sync errors. ~ALYSIS OF SYNCHRONIZATION Loss Let be code words, not necessarily distinct; Definition 1 follows. Definition I An r-symbol loss (gain) in synchronization slip is said to occur if the sequence a,, . . ’ , a,, b,, . . . , b, is framed by the receiver as a,,,, . . . , a,, b,, . . . , b,, where r > n/2 (T 5 [n/2]) and the message is taken in such a way that b” is the first symbol of the sequence to arrive at the receiver.’ De$nition 2 A correctable coset of a code is a coset whose leader is one of the error patterns recognized by the decoder. De$nition 3 A coset code is a block code generated by a cyclic code by adding a fixed polynomial (which is not a code word) of degree less than n to each code word of the cyclic code. A coset code can be decoded by first subtracting the fixed polynomial at the receiver before decoding it as a cyclic code. Since the distance properties are retained in a coset code, the additive-error-correcting property is not affected by using a coset code. However, by choosing a proper coset code one may recover synchronization loss as well. Let p(z) be the fixed polynomial that defines the coset code, and let C(X) be a code word of a burst-error-correcting code. Assume c(x) + p(x), the code word of the coset code, is transmitted over the channel in the absence of noise, and assume an r-symbol loss occurs. The received message, 1 [Xj denotes the integer part of X. I I d{(x) c(x) + P(X) I d;(x) I +---receiver framing -cf ‘x0x’ xn-l ’ Fig. 1. as seen by the decoder, is x%(x> + PC41 + 4 (4 xn d;(z) (1) where d;(x) is the portion of the next word entered into the framing and d;(z) is the higher order r-symbol of the code word out of framing, as shown in Fig. 1. The coefficient of d:(s) is unknown to us, but we do know that it has degree at most r 1. The decoder then subtracts p(x) from the received word; the resultant word is w4 = XWX) + p(x)] + d;(x) ddXx) p(x) = (xl 1)&C) + x?c(x) + d’,(x) &(x) = (xr l)p(x) + d;(x) modulo g(x) in A, where d;(x) d;(x) = d;(x) is a polynomial of degree at most r 1.

Since R(x) is in the residue class of d;(x) /3x%“-’ + CXX~, which is an end-around burst of length r + 2, if b 2 r + 2, then R(x) is a coset leader of a correctable coset. In particular, one may identify an error of value -p in the nth position and an error of value LY in the (r + 1)th position. This information may be used to correct the rsymbol loss. Similarly, one may show that the same p(x) could be used to exhibit an end-around burst of length r + 2, that the first position have error value -QO and the (n r)th position have error value 0 if an r-symbol gain is encountered. Thus we have shown that every cyclic burst-error-correcting code that corrects bursts of length b or less can be made, without additional redundancy, to correct synchronization loss of b 2 symbols or less. In summary the decoding rule is as follows. Given an end-around burst, if the error pattern consists of an error value -/3 in the nth position, and an error value LY in the	asymptotically optimal algorithm;block code;burst error;burst transmission;code word;codec;coefficient;coset leader;cyclic code;emoticon;error detection and correction;floor and ceiling functions;forward error correction;framing (world wide web);modulo operation;polynomial code;resultant;utility functions on indivisible goods;xfig	Shih-Yung Tong	1969	IEEE Trans.

Instead of the conventional complex-valued fast Fourier transform (FFT) for OFDM systems, the proposed architecture employs two real-valued fast DHT (FHT) kernels and one post processing unit. By taking advantage of the real-valued operation of FHT, this approach reduces the number of multiplications compared with the radix-2 FFT. The proposed DHT-based modulator/demodulator was designed and fabricated in 0.18-µm CMOS technology with a core area of 928 × 935µm2. The average power consumption is about 20.16mW at 20MHz and 1.8V supply voltage. Measurement results of the integrated circuit illustrate its superior chip area and power consumption.	discrete hartley transform;hartley (unit);mimo-ofdm;modulation	Muh-Tian Shiue;Chin-Kuo Jao;Pei-Shin Chen	2010	IEICE Transactions		chip;embedded system;discrete hartley transform;fast fourier transform;telecommunications;computer science;integrated circuit;mathematics;rader's fft algorithm	Vision	31.17025165007656	58.060533151847224	40252

The approach, which is a kind of finite field extension of the method presented in [1], does not require the construction of any number-theoretic transform eigenvector set. In this sense, the definition presented in this work is simpler than that of another recently introduced FrNTT.

Using the new shape, this paper presents the first complete addition formulas for binary elliptic curves, i.e., addition formulas that work for all pairs of input points, with no exceptional cases. If n ≥ 3 then the complete curves cover all isomorphism classes of ordinary elliptic curves over F2n . This paper also presents dedicated doubling formulas for these curves using 2M + 6S + 3D, where M is the cost of a field multiplication, S is the cost of a field squaring, and D is the cost of multiplying by a curve parameter. These doubling formulas are also the first complete doubling formulas in the literature, with no exceptions for the neutral element, points of order 2, etc. Finally, this paper presents complete formulas for differential addition, i.e., addition of points with known difference. A differential addition and doubling, the basic step in a Montgomery ladder, uses 5M + 4S + 2D when the known difference is given in affine form.	coefficient;danny lange;montgomery modular multiplication;numerical integration;period-doubling bifurcation;phil bernstein;reza iravani;solid-state drive;turing completeness	Daniel J.

09080f73f64aa1b50bc5baa41e0a7ba3abc58c9c	an efficient design of cmos comparator and folded cascode op-amp circuits using particle swarm optimization with an aging leader and challengers algorithm		Due to the compl ex growth in very large scale integration circuits, the task of optimal analog integrated circuit design by hand is very difficult. Optimization is a time consuming process having many conflicting criteria and a wide range of design parameters. Characterization of complex tradeoffs between nonlinear objectives while assuring required specifications makes analog circuit design a tedious process. The design and optimization processes have to be automated with high accuracy. Evolutionary technique may be a proficient implement for automatic design of analog integrated circuits that has been one of the most challenging topics in VLSI design process. This paper presents a competent approach for optimal designs of two analog circuits, namely, complementary metal oxide semiconductor two-stage comparator with P-type metal oxide semiconductor input driver and n-channel input, folded-cascode operational amplifier. The evolutionary technique used is particle swarm optimization (PSO) with an aging leader and challenger (ALC-PSO). The main aim is to optimize the MOS transistors’ sizes using ALC-PSO in order to reduce the areas occupied by the circuits and to get better performance parameters of the circuits. To exhibit the performance parameters of the circuits, simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis simulation has been carried out by using the optimal values of MOS transistor sizes and other design parameters. Simulation results demonstrate that design specifications are closely met and required functionalities are accommodated. The simulation results also show that the ALC-PSO is superior to the other algorithms in terms of MOS area, and performance parameters like gain, power dissipation, etc. for the examples considered.	algorithm;cmos;comparator;mathematical optimization;operational amplifier applications;particle swarm optimization	Bishnu Prasad De;Rajib Kar;Durbadal Mandal;Sakti Prasad Ghoshal	2016	Int.

If the lifted points are linearly dependent, then the ECDLP is solved. Our purpose is to analyze the practicality of this algorithm. We find that asymptotically the algorithm is virtually certain to fail, because of an absolute bound on the size of the coefficients of a relation satisfied by the lifted points. Moreover, even for smaller values ofp experiments show that the odds against finding a suitable lifting are prohibitively high.	algorithm;coefficient;dependency relation;discrete logarithm;discriminant;elliptic curve cryptography;experiment;lambda lifting;lifting scheme;pigeonhole sort;time complexity	Michael J.

The mapH is represented asH(x+iy, t)=h1(x, y, t)+ih2(x, y, t), whereh1 andh2 are polynomials from ℝ2 × [0,1] into ℝ and i is the imaginary unit. Since all the coefficients ofF andG are real, there is a polynomialh3 such thath2(x, y, t)=yh3(x, y, t). Then the solution setS is divided into two sets {(x, t)∶h1(x, 0, t)=0} and {(x+iy, t)∶h1(x, y, t)=0,h3(x, y, t)=0}. Using this division, we make the structure ofS clear.

This allows us to use concatenated codes with quantum erasure-correcting codes as outer codes for correcting multiple amplitude damping errors.

16a0ec778748a2f76fb7cf0a08ea48afbf503576	classification of transversal gates in qubit stabilizer codes		Transversal operations in quantum error correction, that is logical gates that are executed by applying a set of gates in parallel, are the most straightforward form of fault-tolerant quantum logic. Naturally, characterizing the set of logical gates that can be implemented transversally for a class of codes is of great importance to fault-tolerant quantum architectures. In this work, we classify the set of logical gates that be realized by applying individual diagonal gates transversally. Namely, we show that for qubit stabilizer subspace codes, the set of logical gates that can be implemented by an operation of the form Z(θ)⊗n are restricted to have entries of the form e k along their diagonal, where c is an integer. We show that these results imply that logical gates implemented in this manner must belong to the Clifford hierarchy for all stabilizer codes and moreover the single and multi-qubit gates are restricted to be elements of the same level of the Clifford hierarchy.	error detection and correction;fault tolerance;logic gate;quantum error correction;quantum gate;quantum logic;qubit;stabilizer code	Jonas T.

Many of these calculations take several months to complete, although the operations involved follow straightforward rules. In this paper a program is described, which has been developed in LISP for solving such problems. The manner in which these problems are encountered is outlined, and their representation in the computer discussed.

MTV is a simulator that strikes a balance between accuracy and efficiency. MTV is more accurate than other extended value set simulators because it respects the ordering of events. It is more efficient than exhaustive simulators because it efficiently simulates overlapping events and requires only a single waveform to represent a signal. Features of MTV include: elimination of common ambiguity, symbolic delays, correlated delays, and sophisticated algorithms to detect ordered events. This paper concludes with simulation results from the ISCAS85 benchmark suite.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;benchmark (computing);digital electronics;simulation;waveform	Mark H.

To obtain the K × N matrix, K rows are selected from a J × N matrix Φ, associated with a binary sequence of length J and Hamming weight K, where a set of the selected row indices is the index set of nonzero entries of the binary sequence. It is then discovered that the maximum magnitude of inner products between a pair of distinct code vectors is determined by the maximum magnitude of Φ-transform of the binary sequence. Thus, constructing a codebook with small magnitude of inner products is equivalent to finding a binary sequence where the maximum magnitude of its Φ-transform is as small as possible. From the discovery, new classes of near-optimal codebooks with nontrivial bounds on the maximum inner products are constructed from Fourier and Hadamard matrices associated with binary Sidelnikov sequences.	bitstream;codebook;hamming weight;the matrix;window function	Nam Yul Yu	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings	10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283492	arithmetic;fourier transform;binary code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;linear code;hamming code;mathematics;complex hadamard matrix;hadamard code;statistics	Theory	41.4261692411121	51.08553918850313	42551

This problem can be briefly defined as follows. Given a mesh M, find a mesh G which satisfies the following conditions: (1) G and M have the same number of nodes, (2) for any subset of k edges in G, there is a submesh in G isomorphic to M which excludes these k edges, and (3) G has the least possible number of edges. The mesh G which satisfies these conditions is called a symmetrically optimal k-edge-fault-tolerant (k-eft) extension of M. We show that, even for k = 1, finding such a mesh G is a very difficult problem. We develop necessary and sufficient conditions for characterizing the class of symmetrically optimal 1-eft extensions of any given mesh. We propose two new methods for finding a symmetrically optimal, or symmetrically near-optimal, 1-eft extension. The first method finds an optimal solution, and is useful when the number of dimensions in the given mesh M is not very large. The second method finds a near-optimal solution by decomposing the given mesh M into several meshes (with a fewer number of dimensions) that can be solved by the first method.	electronic funds transfer;fault tolerance;g-code;polygon mesh	Abdel Aziz Farrag	1994	Parallel Computing	10.1016/0167-8191(94)90038-8	fault tolerance;combinatorics;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;distributed computing	DB	34.23647166008188	34.94585480122539	42639

The purpose of this article is to advertise tropical modifications as a tool to locally repair bad embeddings of plane curves, allowing the re-embedded tropical curve to better reflect the geometry of the input curve. Our approach is based on the close connection between analytic curves (in the sense of Berkovich) and tropical curves. We investigate the effect of these tropical modifications on the tropicalization map defined on the analytification of the given curve.Our study is motivated by the case of plane elliptic cubics, where good embeddings are characterized in terms of the j-invariant. Given a plane elliptic cubic whose tropicalization contains a cycle, we present an effective algorithm, based on non-Archimedean methods, to linearly re-embed the curve in dimension 4 so that its tropicalization reflects the j-invariant.

Optical orthogonal signature pattern codes (OOSPCs) have attracted wide attention as signature patterns of spatial CDMA.

Let    $\Theta (m,n,k,\lambda )$    be the largest possible number of codewords among all    $(m,n,k,\lambda )$   -OOSPCs. In this paper, we concentrate on the calculation of the exact value of    $\Theta (m,n,3,1)$    and the construction of an    $(m,n,3,1)$   -OOSPC with    $\Theta (m,n,3,1)$    codewords. As a consequence, we show that    $\Theta (m,n,3,1)=\lfloor \frac {mn-1}{6}\rfloor -1$    when    $mn~\equiv ~14, 20~(\textrm {mod }24)$   , or    $mn~\equiv ~8, 16~(\textrm {mod }24)$    and    $\gcd (m,n,4)=2$   , or    $mn~\equiv ~2~(\textrm {mod }6)$    and    $\gcd (m,n,4)=4$   , and    $\Theta (m,n,3,1)=\lfloor \frac {mn-1}{6}\rfloor $    otherwise.

This work makes three main contributions: first, it is shown that for characterizing metastability it is more reasonable to use input signals with normal or Laplace distributions. Previous work used uniformly-distributed signals in the interest of making derivations easier, but this simplifying assumption overestimated SMR by as much as 18 dB compared to the more reasonable analysis presented here. Second, this work shows that LSB-first SAR ADCs achieve SMR performance equal to or better than conventional SARs with the same metastability window, depending on bandwidth. Finally, the analysis is used to develop a framework for calculating the maximum effective sample rate for asynchronous SAR ADCs, and in doing so demonstrates that proximity detectors are not effective solutions to improving metastability performance.	analog-to-digital converter;bandwidth (signal processing);comparator;least significant bit;metastability in electronics;sampling (signal processing);sensor;shingled magnetic recording	Allen Waters;Jason Muhlestein;Un-Ku Moon	2016	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2016.2594256	probability density function;electronic engineering;real-time computing;bit error rate;logic gate;electrical engineering;mathematics;signal-to-noise ratio;bandwidth;statistics	Visualization	53.42051574205282	56.29860129072084	43733

This extends earlier results, which have been tabulated for 2 ≤ q ≤ 5. We survey known bounds and obtain some new results as well, also for s-surjective codes, which are closely related to covering codes and utilized in some of the constructions.	code word	Gerzson Kéri;Patric R.

The sequence  X   n   has the multiplicative arithmetic property (map) if for each pair of positive relatively prime integers ( m ,  n ) there is a group isomorphism  ϕ   n ,  m   from  G   nm   to  G   n   ×  G   m   such that  ϕ   n ,  m   maps  S   nm   onto  S   n   ×  S   m  . Let  X   n   have the map and let  p   k  ( n ) denote the number of induced  k   cycles  of  X   n  . We show that 2 k   p   k   is a linear combination (over   Z  ) of multiplicative arithmetic functions. In particular, the sequence   Cay(  Z     n   ,   U     n   )  , where   Z     n    is the ring of integers modulo  n  and   Z     n    is the multiplicative group of units modulo  n  has the map. For this sequence explicit formulae for  p  3 ( n ) and  p  4 ( n ) in terms of the primes dividing  n  are given.	magma	Pedro Berrizbeitia;Reinaldo E.

This algorithm is an extension of one due to Savage with the advantage that it is not restricted to coefficients from a set whose cardinality is small compared to the degree of the polynomial. The new algorithm is shown to be asymptotically optimum for evaluating arbitrary functions in finite fields and for evaluating polynomials with real coefficients in a binary fixed-point representation. To illustrate that it is nonasymptotically useful as well, the new algorithm is shown to reduce the time for syndrome calculation for binary Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes of practical interest.	coefficient	Jürg Ganz	1995	SIAM J.

The signs of the eigenvectors of a proximity matrix are not unique and play an important role in computing the correspondences between a set of feature points. We use the coefficients of the elementary symmetric polynomials to make the direction of the eigenvectors of the two proximity matrices consistent with each other for the problem correspondence matching. We compare our method to other methods presented in the literature. The empirical results show that using the coefficients of the elementary symmetric polynomials for eigenvectors sign correction is a better choice to solve the problem.		Muhammad Haseeb;Edwin R.

The merits of the binary (ZCZ equals 2) and quadri-phase (ZCZ equals 4) PSW codes over the existing QS spreading codes are still retained in the proposed polyphase PSW codes. Scrambling patterns for the case of ZCZ of 8 are derived first. Then, the scrambling pattern design rules are generalized for greater ZCZs and a structured procedure to generate polyphase PSW codes for any ZCZ is developed. Finally, the cross-correlation properties of the proposed spreading codes are evaluated.	baillie–psw primality test;bitwise operation;cross-correlation;hadamard code;hadamard transform;polyphase matrix;polyphase quadrature filter;qr code;systematic code	Kwonhue Choi;Huaping Liu	2012	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2011.112311.111380	database index;code division multiple access;binary code;discrete mathematics;telecommunications;computer science;phase-shift keying;scrambling;cross-correlation;mathematics;interference;correlation;fading;statistics	Theory	42.87745093584744	50.24625760644124	44079

Akbari, G. B. Khosrovshahi, and A. Mofidy Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran s_akbari@sharif.edu A 2-design is a set of v points and a family of b subsets of these points called blocks, such that each block has size k and any two points lie in exactly λ common blocks, for some λ > 0. Let A be the v-by-b incidence matrix of a design. A flow is a vector in the null space of A; that is, x ∈ Rb satisfying Ax = 0. A flow is nowhere-zero if none of its entries are zero. It is known ([1]) that every 2-design with b > v possesses a nowhere-zero flow.

However, the true burst correcting capability of a Fire code may exceed its guaranteed burst correcting capability. The true burst correcting capability of primitive Fire codes, in which the irreducible polynomial is primitive, is studied. In particular, the true burst correcting capability maximized over all primitive Fire codes with a given guaranteed burst correcting capability and a given greatest common divisor of the periods of the two factors of its generator polynomial is considered. It is shown that this maximum is attained by an infinite number of such codes.	irreducible polynomial;polynomial code	Wei Zhou;Shu Lin;Khaled A. S.

However, in the real world, it is often important that a design satisfy various non-technical requirements. One such requirement is that a design not possess the key characteristics of any previously known design. This paper shows that genetic programming can be used to generate novel solutions to a design problem so that genetic programming may be potentially used as an invention machine. This paper turns the clock back to the period just before the time (1917) when George Campbell of American Telephone and Telegraph invented and patented the design for an electrical circuit that is now known as the ladder filter. Genetic programming is used to reinvent the Campbell filter. The paper then turns the clock back to the period just before the time (1928) when Wilhelm Cauer invented and patented the elliptic filter. Genetic programming is then used to reinvent a technically equivalent filter that avoids the key characteristics of then-preexisting Campbell filter. Genetic programming can be used as an invention machine by employing a twopart fitness measure that incorporates both the degree to which an individual in the population satisfies the given technical requirements and the degree to which the individual does not possess the key characteristics of preexisting technology.	artificial intelligence;electronic filter topology;elliptic filter;genetic programming;high- and low-level;humans;level design;machine learning;requirement	John R.

The most demanding and complex step of this method is the computation of the roots of a special type of class polynomials, called Hilbert polynomials. However, there are several polynomials, called class polynomials, which can be used in the CM method and have much smaller coefficients, with the prerequisite that their roots can be easily transformed to the roots of the corresponding Hilbert polynomials. In this paper, we propose the use of a new class of polynomials which are derived from Ramanujan’s class invariants tn. We explicitly describe the algorithm for the construction of the new polynomials and give the necessary transformation of their roots to the roots of the corresponding Hilbert polynomials. We provide a theoretical asymptotic bound for the bit precision requirements of all class polynomials and together with extensive experimental assessments, we compare the efficiency of using the new polynomials against the use of the other class polynomials. Our comparison shows that the new class of polynomials clearly outweigh all of the previously used polynomials when they are used in the generation of prime order elliptic curves.	algorithm;chebyshev polynomials;class invariant;coefficient;computation;discriminant;elliptic curve cryptography;hilbert space;polynomial;requirement	Elisavet Konstantinou;Aristides Kontogeorgis	2010	Computers & Mathematics with Applications	10.1016/j.camwa.2010.02.008	gegenbauer polynomials;chebyshev polynomials;difference polynomials;mehler–heine formula;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;kravchuk polynomials;koornwinder polynomials;jacobi polynomials;discrete orthogonal polynomials;division polynomials;complex multiplication;schur polynomial;polynomial arithmetic;classical orthogonal polynomials;laguerre polynomials;hahn polynomials;mathematics;elliptic curve cryptography;orthogonal polynomials;macdonald polynomials;elliptic curve;power sum symmetric polynomial;schoof's algorithm;askey–wilson polynomials;algebra;wilson polynomials	Theory	45.202263330715965	38.75554762907015	44484

We also state that the case of larger $w(geq p)$ can be reduced to that of $0leq wleq p-1$.	bitstream;execution unit;legendre polynomials;pollard's p − 1 algorithm;polynomial	Zhixiong Chen	2018	IET Information Security	10.1049/iet-ifs.2017.0307	theoretical computer science;combinatorics;pseudorandom binary sequence;legendre polynomials;legendre symbol;computer science;integer;quotient	Crypto	42.74773271711675	39.214532803105676	44631

We show that there is no algorithm solving these problems efficiently without exploiting properties of the given representation of ring elements, unless factoring integers is easy. Our results imply that problems with high relevance for a large number of cryptographic applications, such as the quadratic residuosity and the subgroup decision problems, are generically equivalent to factoring.	algorithm;cryptography;decision problem;integer factorization;quadratic residue;relevance	Tibor Jager;Jörg Schwenk	2008	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive		factoring;mathematics;mathematical optimization	Crypto	41.72205938274585	40.87315290057865	44905

a7b883af0288a2eeebb32f101569e7be6740f9b6	the multipurpose bias device - part ii: the efficiency of logical elements	logic element	"""The efficiency of a logical element can be equated with the set of subfunetions it realizes upon biasing or duplication of inputs. Various classes of elements are considered, and optimum or nearoptimum examples are presented. Some related areas of study are suggested. 46 A test of logical efficiency Part I of this paper dealt with the Rutz commutator as a typical multipurpose element,"""" Such elements should provide economy in both number and assortment of logical building blocks. A way of evaluating them, however, is needed. Suppose we find, for two comparable devices, that fewer units of A are generally required than of B in performing logical operations. We judge A more efficient, but seek an easy test of this supremacy. The class of subfunctions a multipurpose device realizes upon biasing or duplication of inputs is easily determined. The larger the class, the more versatile we expect the device to be, since it can be used in a greater variety of ways. Versatility, in turn, should lead to efficiency, since given logical operationscan generally be performed by fewer units of a more versatile device. Here, then, is the basis of the test we need. The technique of biasing inputs was fully explained in Part I of this paper."""" If extra signal loadsare permitted, subfunctions can also be obtained by duplicating inputs. Consider the 3-variable function indicated in the following table: 'Portions of this paper were presented to the International Symposium on the Theory of Switching at Harvard University, April 4, 1957, and as a lecture at Oxford University on May 5, 1958. Row p q r Output 1 1 1 1 1 2 0 1 1 1 3 1 0 1 0 4 0 0 1 1 5 1 1 0 0 6 0 1 0 0 7 1 0 0 1 8 0 0 0 0 The input states are shown (as in Part 1) by the three columns under' p ',' «', and' r '. Biasing of individual inputs yields the 2-variable functions EXCLUSIVE-OR, IFAND-ONLY-IF, IF-THEN, and NOT-IF-THEN. Suppose now we duplicate the inputs indicated by , p ' and' r', that is, we introduce the same signal at both locations. We can determine the effect of this by looking at those rows of the table in which ' p , and ' r ' are assigned like values, namely, rows 1, 3, 6, and 8. The function AND is obtained. If the inputs denoted by' q ' and' r ' are duplicated (rows 1,2, 7, and 8), the function INCLUSIVE-QR is generated. A convenient way of labeling functions is required. If values are assigned input variables in the familiar truthtable manner,' the table of inputs need not be shown. Every function of n variables is uniquely designated by a 2"""" bit (binary) number representing an output. By this IBM JOURNAL -.JANUARY 1959 scheme, for example, 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 and 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 would denote the sum and carry, respectively, of a full adder. Further refinement is possible. Four bits can easily be correlated with a single octal digit, primed or unprinted, The three leftmost bits determine which octal digit is selected. The rightmost bit causes the prime to be added or not. The sixteen possible cases are shown below: Binary Primed octal Binary Primed octal 0 0 0 0 0 I 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 1 0' 1 0 0 1 4' 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 5 0 0 1 1 r 1 0 1 1 5' 0 1 0 0 2 1 1 0 0 6 0 1 0 1 2' 1 1 0 1 6' 0 1 1 0 3 1 1 1 0 7 0 1 1 1 3' 1 1 1 1 7' The primed octal numbers are thus abbreviations for binary numbers which, in turn, designate logical functions. Octal labels will be bracketed to avoid confusion. Some of the more familiar functions are as follows: Function Label Commutative devices of a higher order should prove even less satisfactory. Such elements achieve only commutative subfunctions upon biasing: yet as shown in Table 2, the proportion of commutative functions varies inversely with the number of variables. The test in operation If we count subfunctions of two variables, 4 is the highest rating a 3-variable function obtains from biasing only, and 7, two such functions jointly. These """"high-scoring"""" functions, shown in Table 3, define superior three-input devices. Only the relevant precursors are indicated. On duplication of inputs, the scores of [1 6'] and [ 4' 5 ] are increased to 6; the others remain 4. In fact, 6 is the highest score possible, since any given choice of the two extreme """"end bits"""" will eliminate two of the eight possible subfunctions. A choice of 1 1 prevents [ 1 ] and [3 ]; o... 1, (4) and [ 7]; 1 0, [0'] and [ 3' ]; o... 0, [ 4' ] and [ 5' ]. Hence we regard these two functions as optimum for the three-input, one-output case. The two functions are related, however, since the denial of I 1 6' ] is interchange equivalent to [ 4' 5 ]. Obviously, a function and its denial will have identical scores; also, a function and its """"mirror image."""" The mirror image is the function obtained when the order of bits is reversedIn Part 1, functions like [5'] and [6'], equivalent under permutation of input variables, were grouped into interchange classes,"""" For ease of reference, such classes will often be represented by the precursor, the member with the smallest label numerically. We now return to the scheme of evaluation mentioned above. Assume three kinds of three-input, one-output device: F, G, and H (see Table 1). We fabricate from each (without time or feedback), those of the 68 full 3-variable precursors which require no more than two units. Table 1 is the box score of our effort. Device H is more efficient than G, which in turn surpasses F. We now apply the direct test suggested earlier. Only subjunctions that are full (that is, without vacuous variables) are counted and but one member from each interchange class. In terms of 2-variable subfunctions through biasing alone, F has a rating of 2; G, 4; and H, 4. When duplication is also considered, F and G have the same rating as before; but H scores 6. One further comment is pertinent. Because F (the carry of a full adder) is commutative, the results obtained from biasing its different inputs are identical. Such is not the case, however, for H. The latter's non-commutativity makes the choice of input for biasing significant. As a result, a greater number of subfunctions is produced. Table 3 High-scoring three-input logical elements.

The function 1 1a 1 1a 1 0, for example, is the mirror image of a 1 a 1 1 a 1 1. In the particular case, the mirror image of I 1 6' ] is interchange equivalent to the denial of [ 1 6' }; but this is not always so. Hence, given a score for one interchange class of functions, we know the score for other related interchange classes: that is, denials, mirror images, and denials of mirror images. This collection of at most four interchange classes we shall call a cycle. The precursor with the smallest label numerically for a given cycle is the chief precursor. The function [ 1 6' } is thus chief precursor for the one cycle of three variables which has a first score (biasing only) of 4 and a second score (biasing plus duplication) of 6. As noted above, 7 is the highest first score obtained by a three-input, two-output device. Several such devices also have a maximal second score of 8. It should be emphasized, however, that the immediate count of subfunctions is a less telling measure of efficiency when multi-output elements are considered. Individual high-scoring functions are helpful, but they must be aptly suited to one another-they must """"team"""" well together. A good estimate can be made, however, as to how well suited different elements are by team scoring. The latter technique, which, as we shall see, is ultimately based upon the method of counting subfunctions, can also be used as an added test in one-output cases. Suppose, for example, we must choose between the high-scoring one-output functions [ 4 7 ) and [ 5 6 ]. Both have first and second scores of 4. To resolve this difficulty, we examine teams of two, -that is, all possible hookups (non-feedback) involving two or less units are tested and a single team score produced. From [47] (by second scoring), 17 4-variable and 19 3-variable functions are obtained; from [56],24 4-variable and 26 3-variable functions. Hence we judge [ 5 6 Jthe more powerful device. When all 80 3-variable precursors are examined by team-of-two scoring, [1 6'] and [4' 5] (the only two precursors scoring 6 in 2-variable subfunctions) score far better than any other precursor. [ 1 6' }has a team-of-two second SCore of 44 3-variable subfunctions and [4' 5 ], 41. No other precursor has a larger score than 32. It is of note, however, that [ 1 6'] and [4' 5], interchange denials of one another, team score differently. There is apparent advantage in a a ... 1 as against a 1 ... a endbit situation; and, indeed, we see by reflection that this is the case. With 1 ... a end-bits, all two-unit hookups of a given device are equivalent when the five variable inputs are alike, that is, all on or all off. Such is not the case, however, when the end bits are a ... 1. As it turns out, every full non-commutative 3-variab1e precursor with o ... 1 end bits team scores higher than its interchange denial.

In the paper, they extend the on-sensor block coding MLP study, to include a statistical analysis of the MLP sensitivity to implementation errors occuring in standard CMOS fabrication processes. Employing simple offset models, a comparison is made of the MLP with other block encoders based on full-search entropy-constrained vector quantisation (ECVQ) of the data, and it is verified that the MLPs are less sensitive over a wide range of rate-distortion compression points. By introducing a realistic linear model that takes into account sensitivity and the complexity performances for both systems, the authors verify that, for MLPs, the sensitivity becomes less dependent on the complexity as the expected quality loss is allowed to increase. Without setting a limit on the expected quality loss, the MLPs are consistently better than the ECVQs, both in terms of sensitivity and complexity for a precision equivalent to 6 bits.	cmos;distortion;encoder;focal (programming language);image compression;linear model;memory-level parallelism;multilayer perceptron;performance;quad flat no-leads package;transistor count;vector quantization	José Gabriel Rodríguez Carneiro Gomes;Antonio Petraglia;Sanjit K.

00d2ccda5b727aaefebe47a580d8e3cb38d5b14f	an area-efficient non-uniform filter bank for low overhead reconfiguration of multi-standard software radio channelizers	reconfigurability;low complexity;software radio receivers;filter banks;interpolation and masking	The channelizer in a software defined radio (SDR) base station extracts individual radio channels from the digitized wideband input signal at a very high sampling rate. The base station channelizer must be able to simultaneously extract multiple channels of non-uniform bandwidths corresponding to channel bandwidths of different communication standards. Reconfigurability and low complexity are the two key requirements in the SDR channelizer. A new reconfigurable filter bank (FB) architecture based on interpolation and masking technique for SDR channelizers is proposed in this paper. The proposed FB can be used for obtaining very narrow passband channels with extremely low complexity. Using a cascaded structure of the proposed FB, it is possible to extract channels of fractional passband widths by changing the interpolation factor. Design example shows that the proposed FB offers complexity reduction of 84% over the conventional per-channel (PC) approach. The proposed FB has been implemented and tested on Xilinx Virtex 2v3000ff1152-4 FPGA. Implementation results show that the proposed FB offers area reduction of 48.37%, speed improvement of 52.7% and power reduction of 75.9% over the PC approach.	filter bank	Raveendranatha P. Mahesh;A.

In this method, the message is encoded using a turbo code. Then the parities are heavily punctured using an iterative process and all non-punctured parities along with side information are sent to the decoder. To improve the performance, a single code can be replaced by a library of codes. The message is compressed using each code and the best result is sent to the decoder. The side information contains the number of punctured parities and the index of the applied code. Instead of transmitting the code index, we find a criterion to detect the code index using the transmitted parities, at the decoder. Compared to the case where the code index is transmitted, our method helps to achieve a better rate for short block length turbo source coders.	block code;data compression;encoder;forward error correction;iteration;loss function;lossless compression;matched filter;transmitter;triple modular redundancy;turbo code	Javad Haghighat;M.

So far multiple output bent functions F : GF(2) n → GF(2) m (where n is even and m n/2), for any particular class of Boolean bent functions, has been generated using a suitable collection of m Boolean bent functions so that any nonzero linear combination of these functions is again bent. Here, we take a different approach by deriving these functions directly from the known classes of so-called monomial trace bent functions. We derive a sufficient condition for a bent Boolean function of the form f (x) = Tr n 1 (λx d) so that the associated mapping F (x) = Tr n m (λx d), where F : GF(2) n → GF(2) m , is a multiple output bent function. We consider all the main cases of monomial trace bent functions and specify the restrictions on λ and m that yield multiple output bent functions F (x) = Tr n m (λx d). Interestingly enough, in one particular case when n = 4r, d = (2 r + 1) 2 , a multiple bent function F (x) = Tr n 2r (ax d) could not be obtained by considering a collection of 2r Boolean bent functions of the form f i (x) = Tr n 1 (λ i x d) for some suitable coefficients λ i ∈ GF(2 n).	bent function;coefficient;cryptography;emoticon;monomial;polynomial	Enes Pasalic;Wei-Guo Zhang	2012	Inf.

cf0cc7ddf6487fce9f482aeab5e2f8cfb56a9b7c	9-variable boolean functions with nonlinearity 242 in the generalized rotation class	nonlinearity;dihedral symmetry;boolean functions;combinatorial problems;rotational symmetry.;cryptography;boolean function;steepest descent;rotational symmetry;reed muller code;first order;heuristic search;search algorithm	In 2006, 9-variable Boolean functions having nonlinearity 241, which is strictly greater than the bent concatenation bound of 240, have been discovered in the class of Rotation Symmetric Boolean Functions (RSBFs) by Kavut, Maitra and Yücel. To improve this nonlinearity result, we have firstly defined some subsets of the n-variable Boolean functions as the “generalized classes of k-RSBFs and k-DSBFs (k-Dihedral Symmetric Boolean Functions)”, where k is a positive integer dividing n and k-RSBFs is a subset of l-RSBFs if k < l. Secondly, utilizing the steepest-descent like iterative heuristic search algorithm used previously to identify the 9-variable RSBFs with nonlinearity 241, we have made a search within the classes of 3-RSBFs and 3-DSBFs. The search has accomplished to find 9-variable Boolean functions with nonlinearity 242 in both of these classes. It should be emphasized that although the class of 3RSBFs contains functions with nonlinearity 242; 1-RSBFs or simply RSBFs, which is a subset of 3-RSBFs, does not contain any. This result also shows that the covering radius of the first order Reed-Muller code R(1, 9) is at least equal to 242. Thirdly, motivated by the fact that RSBFs are invariant under a special permutation of the input vector, we have classified all possible permutations up to the linear equivalence of Boolean functions that are invariant under those permutations. Specifically, for 9-variable Boolean functions, 9! possible permutations are classified into 30 classes; and the search algorithm identifies some of these classes as rich. The rich classes yield new Boolean functions with nonlinearity 242 having different autocorrelation spectra from those of the functions found in the generalized 3-RSBF and 3-DSBF classes. However, there is no zero value in the Walsh spectra of these functions; hence, none of them can be linearly transformed to 9-variable balanced functions with nonlinearity 242.	autocorrelation;combinatorial search;computation;concatenation;gradient descent;grammatical framework;hadamard transform;heuristic;iterative method;linear logic;nonlinear system;reed–muller code;search algorithm;turing completeness	Selçuk Kavut;Melek Diker Yücel	2008	CoRR			Theory	42.07896183113366	42.67457854467932	46277

The design uses time-to-digital converters (TDCs) as delay sensors and a variable length ring oscillator (VLRO) as clock generator. The VLRO naturally adapts its frequency to the PVTA variations suffered by its logic gates while the TDCs are used to track these variations across the chip and modify the VLRO length in order to allocate them. The proposed system has been implemented in a silicon chip using a 65nm process. The fabricated chip has been used to test the system adaptive capabilities under SSHet voltage variations. Measurement results show that it effectively adapts the VLRO length, and hence the clock frequency, to the supply voltage variations.	analog-to-digital converter;application-specific integrated circuit;clock generator;clock rate;logic gate;ring oscillator;sensor;time-to-digital converter	Jordi Perez-Puigdemont;Francesc Moll	2016	2016 International Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI (GLSVLSI)	10.1145/2902961.2903006	embedded system;electronic engineering;real-time computing;time-to-digital converter;telecommunications;clock domain crossing;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;operating system;ring oscillator;design for testing;digital clock manager	EDA	26.79486338163846	57.107386640758925	46342

Motivated by this, we give an explicit map from pairs of coprime polynomials to nonsingular Hankel matrices that explains this connection. A basic tool used here is the classical notion of Bezoutian of two polynomials. Moreover, we give simpler and direct proofs of the general formulae for the number of m-tuples of relatively prime polynomials over Fq of given degrees and for the number of n× n Hankel matrices over Fq of a given rank.	bézout matrix;coefficient;monic polynomial	Mario García-Armas;Sudhir R.

Several techniques for parameterizing a rational algebraic surface as a whole exist. However, in many applications, it suffices to parameterize a small portion of the surface. This motivates the analysis of local parametrizations, i.e., parametrizations of a small neighborhood of a given point P of the surface S. In this paper we introduce several techniques for generating such parameterizations for nonsingular cubic surfaces. For this class of surfaces, it is shown that the local parametrization problem can be solved for all points, and any such surface can be covered completely.	algorithm;cubic function;experiment;geometric modeling;heuristic;linear algebra;numerical stability;randomness;regular expression;round-off error;rounding;symbolic computation	Ibolya Szilágyi;Bert Jüttler;Josef Schicho	2006	J.

Despite the central role of entanglement in quantum information theory, however, there are still a number of open problems in the theoretical characterization of entangled systems that make symbolic and numerical simulation on n-qubit quantum registers indispensable for present-day research. To facilitate the investigation of the separability and entanglement properties of n-qubit quantum registers, here we present a revised version of the FEYNMAN program in the framework of the computer algebra system MAPLE. In addition to all previous capabilities of this MAPLE code for defining and manipulating quantum registers, the program now provides various tools which are necessary for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of entanglement in n-qubit quantum registers. A simple access, in particular, is given to several algebraic separability criteria as well as a number of entanglement measures and related quantities. As in the previous version, symbolic and numeric computations are equally supported.	computation;computer algebra system;computer simulation;information theory;linear separability;maple;numerical analysis;quantum entanglement;quantum information;quantum system;qubit	T.

Finding new binary sequences with optimal autocorrelation has been an interesting research topic in sequence design. Ding-Helleseth-Lam sequences are such a class of binary sequences of period p, where p is an odd prime with p ≡ 1(mod 4). The objective of this letter is to present a construction of binary sequences of period 4p via interleaving four suitable Ding-Helleseth-Lam sequences. This construction generates new binary sequences with optimal autocorrelation which can not be produced by earlier ones.	autocorrelation;cryptography;forward error correction;gödel numbering for sequences;lam/mpi;woo–lam	Wei Su;Yang Yang;Cuiling Fan	2018	Des.

It will be shown that the partitionπ also must have the substitution property and that these two conditions are sufficient for ann state strongly connected automaton to have a group of automorphisms of orderm. Necessary and sufficient conditions for twon-state strongly connected automata to have isomorphic automorphism groups are given. Also, it is demonstrated that forT ii to equalT jj it is necessary to check only a finite number of tapes and consequently provide an algorithm for determining whether or notA has a group of automorphisms of orderm.	algorithm;automaton;emoticon;finite-state machine;graph automorphism;strongly connected component	Bruce H.

f0860654c99ede46bd78b3a1eb5148e8a775cf73	efficiently repairing algebraic geometry codes		Minimum storage regenerating codes have minimum storage of data in each node and therefore are maximal distance separable (MDS for short) codes. Thus, the number of nodes is upper bounded by 2, where b is the bits of data stored in each node. From both theoretical and practical points of view (see the details in Section 1), it is natural to consider regenerating codes that nearly have minimum storage of data, and meanwhile the number of nodes is unbounded. One of the candidates for such regenerating codes is an algebraic geometry code. In this paper, we generalize the repairing algorithm of Reed-Solomon codes given in [11, STOC2016] to algebraic geometry codes and present an efficient repairing algorithm for arbitrary one-point algebraic geometry codes. By applying our repairing algorithm to the one-point algebraic geometry codes based on the Garcia-Stichtenoth tower, one can repair a code of rate 1 − ε and length n over Fq with bandwidth (n − 1)(1 − τ) log q for any ε = 2 log q with a real τ ∈ (0, 1/2). In addition, storage in each node for an algebraic geometry code is close to the minimum storage. Due to nice structures of Hermitian curves, repairing of Hermitian codes is also investigated. As a result, we are able to show that algebraic geometry codes are regenerating codes with good parameters. An example reveals that Hermitian codes outperform Reed-Solomon codes for certain parameters.	algorithm;folded reed–solomon code;linear algebra;maximal set;reed–solomon error correction	Lingfei Jin;Yuan Luo;Chaoping Xing	2017	CoRR		discrete mathematics;mathematics;separable space;hermitian matrix;algebraic geometry;bounded function;code (cryptography);bandwidth (signal processing)	Theory	38.60178897213552	52.92702287639198	47429

5631c8fc941003af84ed29f6a3fd481136391a4c	the spectrum of room cubes		A Room square of side n is an n by n array of cells, whose entries are chosen from a setS of n + 1 objects called symbols, which satisfies the following conditions: (i) every cell of the array is either empty or contains an unordered pair of distinct symbols from S; (ii) each symbol occurs in every row and in every column of the array; (iii) every unordered pair of symbols occurs precisely once in the array. If t;;;.: 2 is an integer, a Room t-cube of side n is at-dimensional array, each cell of which is either empty or contains an unordered pair of two distinct elements chosen from a set of size n +1, such that each 2-dimensional projection is a Room square of side n. In this paper we consider Room 3-cubes which we refer to as Room cubes. Let R3 ={n: there exists a Room cube of side n}. Room t-cubes can be equivalently described as certain types of Latin squares. Such a formulation has the advantage of being easier to visualize if t;;;.: 3. A Latin square L of side n is an n by n array of cells, each of which contains exactly one symbol chosen from a set S of size n, such that each element of S occurs once in each row and once in each column of L. Suppose the rows and columns of L are indexed by the members of S. L is said to be idempotent if L(s, s) = s for each s E S. L is said to be symmetric if L(s, s') =L(s', s) for every {s, s'}£ S. Now impose any linear ordering on S. Two Latin squares L and M, on the symbol set S, are said to be orthogonal symmetric Latin squares provided Land M are both symmetric and idempotent, and for every (s, s') E S X S there exists at most one cell (sh s2) with s1 < s2 such that (s, s') = (L(sh s2), M(sh s2)). We refer to a set of t orthogonal symmetric Latin squares as t pairwise orthogonal symmetric Latin squares (POSLS) if each pair of squares is orthogonal symmetric.

This leads to interesting fish-like graphs. Several results about the values taken on torus knots are proved. ‘First the fish must be caught.’ That is easy: a baby, I think, could have caught it. — The Red Queen, Through the Looking Glass. Introduction. The two simplest non-trivial Vassiliev knot invariants (see [18, 3]) are of type two and type three. These invariants have been studied from various angles: for instance, combinatorial formulæ for evaluating them have been derived, and simple bounds in terms of crossing number have been obtained (see e.g. [12, 9, 19]). In this work they are examined from the novel point of view of the actual values that they take on knots of small crossing number. For instance, one can ask how accurate the known bounds are, as in Section 1. When looking at this question I was led to plot the values of these invariants which revealed the interesting “fish” plots of Section 2: these pictures form the focus of this note. Various ideas which arise from these graphs can be answered for torus knots and this is done is Section 3. The final section presents some problems and further questions. 1. On v2 and v3. The space of additive invariants of type three is two dimensional. By “the first two Vassiliev invariants” is meant the elements of a basis {v2, v3} of this space. The invariants v2 and v3 can be defined canonically in the following fashion. The space of additive invariants of type three splits into the direct sum of type three invariants which do not distinguish mirror image knots and the type three invariants which differ by a factor of minus one on mirror image knots. Pick the vector in each of these one dimensional spaces which takes the value one on the positive trefoil. The one which is invariant under taking mirror images is of type two and will be denoted v2; the other will be denoted v3. The invariant v2 has appeared in various guises previously in knot theory: it is the coefficient of z2 in the Conway polynomial and its reduction modulo two is the Arf invariant. Both v2 and v3 can be obtained from the Jones polynomial in the following fashion.

A key factor in the approval of the 802.12 standard was the demonstrated error detection properties of its coding scheme. In particular, the coding scheme allows the detection of error bursts affecting encoded data carried on four parallel conductors, using nothing more than the standard IEEE 32-bit cyclic redundancy check applied to the unencoded data. Although these error detection properties were presented for verification as part of the standards process, for many years commercial considerations prevented public disclosure of how the code was actually found. These considerations no longer apply, and, in this paper, we explain in detail the design principles of the code, combining geometrical insight, linear algebra, combinatorial reasoning, and computer search.	32-bit;burst error;code word;cyclic redundancy check;error detection and correction;lvm;linear algebra;network packet;run-length encoding;search algorithm;token ring;wiring	S.

f6b6b0ec39fb453c6974915ac9c8d12d5b7dd3ef	the polynomials of mahler and roots of unity		AbstractKurt Mahler in 1982 studied a special sequence of very sparse (0,1)-polynomials which have only powers of 2 as exponents. In this paper we study divisibility properties of these polynomials by certain cyclotomic polynomials and prove an explicit version of a result that was given only implicitly by Mahler. We also consider the distribution of real and complex noncyclotomic zeros, improving some of Mahler’s results. Then we show that the derivatives of the polynomials of Mahler have all their zeros inside the unit circle. We conclude this paper with some further remarks and open questions.	root of unity;roots	Karl Dilcher;Larry Ericksen	2015	The American Mathematical Monthly	10.4169/amer.math.monthly.122.04.338	algebra;mathematical analysis;mathematics;polynomial;cyclotomic polynomial;unit circle;root of unity;divisibility rule	Vision	43.01388085925887	35.130823836990224	47710

An instance of the index coding problem includes a server that holds a set of information messages X = {x1,... ,xk} and a set of receivers R. Each receiver has some side information, known to the server, represented by a subset of X and demands another subset of X. The server uses a noiseless communication channel to broadcast encodings of messages in X to satisfy the receivers' demands. The goal of the server is to find an encoding scheme that requires the minimum number of transmissions. we show that any instance of the network coding problem can be efficiently reduced to an instance of the index coding problem. Our reduction shows that several important properties of the network coding problem carry over to the index coding problem. In particular, we prove that both scalar linear and vector linear codes are insufficient for achieving the minimal number of transmissions.	channel (communications);line code;linear network coding;server (computing)	Salim Y.

To this end it is only necessary that we have a mechanism, applicable to a given cut-set matrix, which sorts out those rows that correspond to the outermost twigs or tips of the tree, for we can then form an abbridged cut-set matrix corresponding to what is left of the total graph after the tree tips with their uniquely attached links are pruned away. This remainder again has tips which can be found and eliminated in the same way. Continuation thus reveals the desired growth pattern. Since the method cannot fail to yield a graph if its existence is compatible with the structure of the given matrix, it may be regarded as a constructive test for fulfillment of necessary and sufficient conditions.

Of particular interest is the case of k =2”‘‘, where we can choose this Hadamard code to be a subcode of the punctured first order Reed-Muller code RM( 1, rn).

The above problem amounts to finding the k-covering radius of a (2k,4k, k1) Hadamard code. We find upper and lower bounds on this integer, and determine it for small values of k.

The problem of finding factorizations of this type was first introduced by Hajos [3] in 1941. Since then a number of papers have appeared on the subject. More recently, Magliveras [6] has applied factorization of permutation groups to cryptography to obtain a private-key cryptosystem. Factorizations in the elementary abelian p-group were exploited (but not explicitly stated in these terms) by Webb [13] to produce a public-key cryptosystem conceptually similar to cryptosystems based on the knapsack problem. Using the result that certain types of factorizations in the elementary abelian p-group are necessarily transversal (a term introduced by Magliveras), this paper shows that the public-key system proposed by Webb is insecure.	cryptosystem;key;knapsack problem;public-key cryptography;symmetric-key algorithm	Minghua Qu;Scott A.

1971fe279bb4d6437009a9a245b0feff802b38c2	reconstruction of splines from local average samples		We study the reconstruction of cardinal splines f(t), from their average samples yn = f ∗h(n), n ∈ Z, when the average function h(t) has support in [−1/2, 1/2]. We investigate the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the following problem: for given dates yn, find a cardinal spline f(t), of a given degree, satisfying yn = f ∗ h(n), n ∈ Z. 1 Spline interpolation and average sampling First, let us introduce some notation and recall some of the fundamental results of Schoenberg’s magnificent cardinal interpolation spline theory (see [4]). Let βd be the cardinal central B-spline of degree d, βd := X[−1/2,1/2] ∗ . . . ∗ X[−1/2,1/2] (d+ 1 terms) and let Sd the space generated by the shift of βd, i.e. the set of functions f(t) that admit a representation of the form f(t) = ∑ n∈Z an βd(t− n) with appropriate coefficients an. When d is odd, the space Sd is the set of cardinal splines of degree d with knot sequence Z, i.e. the set of functions f ∈ Cd−1(R) such that for all k ∈ Z, f |[k,k+1) belongs to Πd the class of polynomials of degree not exceeding d. When d is even, the knot sequence is Z + 1/2, i.e. Sd := { f ∈ Cd−1(R) : f |[k−1/2,k+1/2) ∈ Πd, k ∈ Z } . We consider the cardinal spline interpolation problem: Given a sequence of real numbers {yn}n∈Z, find a spline f ∈ Sd such that f(n) = yn, n ∈ Z. For d = 1 the problem has a unique solution, the linear spline obtained by linear interpolation between every pair of consecutive data, but for d > 1 it has infinitely many solutions forming a linear manifold in Sd of dimension d−1 when d is odd, and of dimension d when d is even. Growth conditions give the uniqueness. Specifically, denoting Sd,γ := { f(t) ∈ Sd : f(t) = (|t|) as t 7→ ±∞ } , Dγ := { {yn}n∈Z : yn = O(|n|) as n 7→ ±∞ } , for γ ≥ 0, Shoenberg proved that for a given sequence of real numbers {yn}n∈Z ∈ Dγ , the problem: Find a spline f ∈ Sd,γ satisfying f(n) = yn, n ∈ Z, ∗E-mail: gerardo.perez@upm.es †E-mail: alberto.portal@upm.es	b-spline;coefficient;cubic hermite spline;existential quantification;laurent polynomial;linear interpolation;numerical analysis;polynomial;sampling (signal processing);simulation;spline (mathematics);spline interpolation	Gerardo Pérez-Villalón;A.

Function f is called k r o b u s t i m m u n e if the algebraic immunity of f is always not less than k no matter how one changes the value of f(x) for k ≤ |x| ≤ n ? k. For any field ?? $\mathbb {F}$ , any integers n, k ? 0, we characterize all k robust immune symmetric boolean functions in n variables. The proof is based on a known symmetrization technique and constructing a partition of nonnegative integers satisfying certain (in)equalities about p-adic distance, where p is the characteristic of the field ?? $\mathbb {F}$ .	linear algebra;multilinear polynomial	Yuan Li	2014	Cryptography and Communications	10.1007/s12095-014-0120-7	combinatorics;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;mathematics;algebra	Theory	43.1602402770951	36.84623961779308	48361

We determine all values of  k  for which there exists a complete  k -arc in PG( n,q ),   q − 2 ⩾ n > q −   q  2   −   11  4  . This is proven by using the duality principle between  k -arcs in PG( n, q ) and dual  k -arcs in PG( k  −  n  − 2,  q ) ( k ⩾ n +4). The theorems show that the classification of all complete  k -arcs in PG( n, q ),  q  even and   q − 2 ⩾ n > q −   q  2   −   11  4  , is closely related to the classification of all ( q +2)-arcs in PG(2, q ).

Due to the simple transition rules that govern these CA, the implementation of such models is quite easy.

The proposed design results in quasi-cyclic G-LDPC codes for which efficient encoding is feasible through shift-register-based circuits. The structure imposed on the bipartite graphs, together with the choice of simple component codes, leads to a class of codes suitable for fast iterative decoding. A pragmatic approach to the construction of G-LDPC codes is proposed. The approach is based on the substitution of check nodes in the protograph of a low-density parity-check code with stronger nodes based, for instance, on Hamming codes. Such a design approach, which we call LDPC code doping, leads to low-rate quasi-cyclic G-LDPC codes with excellent performance in both the error floor and waterfall regions on the additive white Gaussian noise channel.	additive white gaussian noise;doping (semiconductor);error floor;hamming code;iterative method;low-density parity-check code;shift register;utility functions on indivisible goods	Gianluigi Liva;William E.

Any word r meeting the equality is called a deep hole. Guruswami and Vardy (2005) showed that for a specific class of codes, determining whether or not a word is a deep hole is NP-hard. They suggested passingly that it may be easier when the evaluation set of C is large or structured. Following this idea, we study the case where the evaluation set is the image of a Dickson polynomial, whose values appear with a special uniformity. To find families of received words that are not deep holes, we reduce to a subset sum problem (or equivalently, a Dickson polynomial-variation of Waring’s problem) and find solution conditions by applying an argument using estimates on character sums indexed over the evaluation set.	circuit complexity;code;dickson polynomial;folded reed–solomon code;reed–solomon error correction;subset sum problem	Matt Keti;Daqing Wan	2016	Finite Fields and Their Applications	10.1016/j.ffa.2016.03.005	arithmetic;waring's problem;mathematics;subset sum problem;reed–solomon error correction;algorithm;algebra	ECom	39.3648238350019	52.86747830366763	49178

It had spectacular successes in factoring numbers of a special form. Then the method was adapted for general numbers, and recently applied to the RSA-130 number [6], setting a new world record in factorization. The NFS has undergone several modifications since its appearance. One of these modifications concerns the last stage: the computation of the square root of a huge algebraic number given as a product of hundreds of thousands of small ones. This problem was not satisfactorily solved until the appearance of an algorithm by Peter Montgomery. Unfortunately, Montgomery only published a preliminary version of his algorithm [15], while a description of his own implementation can be found in [7]. In this paper, we present a variant of the algorithm, compare it with the original algorithm, and discuss its complexity.	algorithm;computation;fastest;general number field sieve;integer factorization;montgomery modular multiplication;rsa numbers	Phong Q.

Furthermore, a full set of examples of applications in the domain of artificial vision, where many constraints boil down to polynomial systems, are presented. Emphasis is also put on very recent methods for determining the number of (isolated) real and complex roots of such systems.	computation;computer vision;gröbner basis;linear algebra;polynomial;resultant;roots	Sylvain Petitjean	1999	Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision	10.1023/A:1008348724781	discrete mathematics;symbolic computation;algebraic geometry;gröbner basis;linear algebra;equation;resultant;mathematics;geometry;factorization of polynomials;square-free polynomial;polarization of an algebraic form;polynomial;algebra	Theory	48.80488165747501	36.50242743916683	49755

Sharing a common fuzzy-logic based framework, the tools are part of FASY (Fuzzy-Logic-Based Analog Synthesis), an analog design package developed at the University of Seville. The first tool uses fuzzy logic for topology selection of analog cells. It follows decision rules directly entered by a human expert or automatically generated from its experience with earlier designs. Second, a performance-modeling tool provides a qualitative description of a circuit's behavior. Alternatively, it can use a learning process to accurately model circuit performance. Finally, an analog testing tool uses a fuzzy-neuron classifier to detect and classify faults in analog circuits.	fuzzy logic	Antonio Torralba;Jorge Chávez;Leopoldo García Franquelo	1996	IEEE Micro	10.1109/40.526926	fuzzy logic;mixed-signal integrated circuit;topology;embedded system;packaging and labeling;analogue electronics;computer science;decision rule;fault detection and isolation	Arch	24.844515964786755	47.780701532968415	49757

Moreover, their probability of decoder error is exponentially small in the block length of the codes. In this survey, we will explain exactly what this statement means, how it is derived, and what problems in the complexity of error-correcting codes remain open. Along the way, we will survey some key developments in the complexity of error-correcting codes.	block code;code (cryptography);concatenation;forward error correction;polynomial;shannon (unit);time complexity	Daniel A.

These are called ( r  1 ,  r  2 )-error-correcting codes. If these balls are not only disjoint but also partition the space of all words, then  C  is called perfect. We are especially interested in codes with the property that centers of balls with the same radius  r i   are at least 2 r   i   + 2 apart ( i  = 1, 2). These are called bipartite codes. Our main theorem states that a bipartite perfect ( r , 1)-error-correcting code with  r  ⩾ 2 must have  r  = 2 and in fact is obtained from a code with the parameters of a Preparata code.		J.

Combining algebraic geometry techniques with differential topology ones, we first prove a result that generalizes those previously published on this topic. In particular, we consider the input set (complex projective space of MIMO interference channels), the output set (precoder and decoder Grassmannians), and the solution set (channels, decoders, and precoders satisfying the IA polynomial equations), not only as algebraic sets, but also as smooth compact manifolds. Using this mathematical framework, we prove that the linear alignment problem is feasible when the algebraic dimension of the solution variety is larger than or equal to the dimension of the input space and the linear mapping between the tangent spaces of both smooth manifolds given by the first projection is generically surjective. If that mapping is not surjective, then the solution variety projects into the input space in a singular way and the projection is a zero-measure set. This result naturally yields a simple feasibility test, which amounts to checking the rank of a matrix. We also provide an exact arithmetic version of the test, which proves that testing the feasibility of IA for generic MIMO channels belongs to the bounded-error probabilistic polynomial complexity class.	bpp (complexity);coefficient;complexity class;interference (communication);linear algebra;mimo;polynomial;time complexity	Oscar Gonzalez;Carlos Beltrán;Ignacio Santamaría	2014	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2014.2301440	tangent space;constant coefficients;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;differential topology;space mapping;algebraic geometry;probability;communication complexity;mathematics;linear map;statistics;polynomial;mimo	Theory	44.16939479189616	51.637865170033216	50581

6f9125bc5fd9199d34373f8df71ac56e2687210e	cyclone codes		We introduce Cyclone codes which are rateless erasure resilient codes. They combine Pair codes with Luby Transform (LT) codes by computing a code symbol from a random set of data symbols using bitwise XOR and cyclic shift operations. The number of data symbols is chosen according to the Robust Soliton distribution. XOR and cyclic shift operations establish a unitary commutative ring if data symbols have a length of p − 1 bits, for some prime number p. We consider the graph given by code symbols combining two data symbols. If n/2 such random pairs are given for n data symbols, then a giant component appears, which can be resolved in linear time. We can extend Cyclone codes to data symbols of arbitrary even length, provided the Goldbach conjecture holds. Applying results for this giant component, it follows that Cyclone codes have the same encoding and decoding time complexity as LT codes, while the overhead is upper-bounded by those of LT codes. Simulations indicate that Cyclone codes significantly decreases the overhead of extra coding symbols.	bitwise operation;circular shift;cyclone;exclusive or;fountain code;giant component;luby transform code;michael luby;overhead (computing);pollard's p − 1 algorithm;soliton distribution;time complexity	Christian Schindelhauer;Andreas Jakoby;Sven Köhler	2017	2017 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	10.1109/ISIT.2017.8006509	erasure code;fountain code;combinatorics;block code;discrete mathematics;tornado code;online codes;luby transform code;linear code;mathematics;raptor code	Theory	40.10471384246657	56.89803878384793	50734

97951b5db72aa35af5376e2f6cb4dd93aaf64420	the screen representation of spin networks: 2d recurrence, eigenvalue equation for 6j symbols, geometric interpretation and hamiltonian dynamics		This paper treats 6j symbols or their orthonormal forms as a function of two variables spanning a square manifold which we call the “screen”. We show that this approach gives important and interesting insight. This two dimensional perspective provides the most natural extension to exhibit the role of these discrete functions as matrix elements that appear at the very foundation of the modern theory of classical discrete orthogonal polynomials. Here we present 2D and 1D recursion relations that are useful for the direct computation of the orthonormal 6j, which we name U . We present a convention for the order of the arguments of the 6j that is based on their classical and Regge symmetries, and a detailed investigation of new geometrical aspects of the 6j symbols. Specifically we compare the geometric recursion analysis of Schulten and Gordon with the methods of this paper. The 1D recursion relation, written as a matrix diagonalization problem, permits an interpretation as a discrete Shrödinger-like equations and an asymptotic analysis illustrates semiclassical and classical limits in terms of Hamiltonian evolution.	computation;file spanning;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);polynomial;recurrence relation;recursion;semiclassical physics;transformation matrix	Roger W.

This formula owes its origin to the existence of a dual pair of symplectic groups acting on spinors, as pointed out by Hasegawa. The first combinatorial proof, based on symplectic tableaux and a variation of the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth correspondence, was due to Terada. Here we use Sch\""""utzenberger's jeu de taquin, augmented by two simple zero weight transformations. The identity itself generalizes a well known identity expressing $\prod^{m}_{i=1} \prod^{n}_{j=1} (x_i + y_j)$ as a sum of products of Schur functions that was due to Littlewood and proved combinatorially by Remmel.  We offer an alternative combinatorial proof of this identity by means of the jeu de taquin, as a precursor to the proof of the symplectic identity"""	lagrange multiplier;symplectic integrator	Angèle M.

The algorithm produces unimodular U, V and the diagonal Jacobson form J such that UAV=J. It requires time polynomial in degx(A), degz(A) and n. We also present tight bounds on the degrees of entries in U, V and J. The algorithm is probabilistic of the Las Vegas type: we assume we are able to generate random elements of F at unit cost, and will always produces correct output within the expected time. The main idea is that a randomized, unimodular, preconditioning of A will have a Hermite form whose diagonal is equal to that of the Jacobson form. From this the reduction to the Jacobson form is easy. Polynomial-time algorithms for the Hermite form have already been established.	algorithm;polynomial	Mark Giesbrecht;Albert Heinle	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-32973-9_10	combinatorics;calculus;mathematics;algebra	Theory	41.91762881623558	37.074568566181384	51362

Structures of tridiagonal inverse M -matrices and Hessenberg inverse M -matrices are analysed. It is proved that the product A ◦AT satis es Willoughby’s necessary conditions for being an inverse M -matrix when A is an irreducible inverse M -matrix. It is also proved that when A is either a Hessenberg inverse M -matrix or a tridiagonal inverse M -matrix then A◦AT is an inverse M -matrix. Based on these results, the conjecture that A◦AT is an inverse M -matrix when A is an inverse M -matrix is made. Unfortunately, the conjecture is not true.

We first introduce a new upper bound on nonlinearity of a given resilient function depending on the propagation criterion. We later show that a large class of resilient functions admit a linear structure; more generally, we exhibit some divisibility properties concerning the Walsh-spectrum of the derivatives of any resilient function. We prove that, fixing the order of resiliency and the degree of propagation criterion, a high algebraic degree is a necessary condition for construction of functions with good autocorrelation properties. We conclude by a study of the main constructions of resilient functions. We notably show how to avoid linear structures when a linear concatenation is used and when the recursive construction introduced in [11] is chosen.	autocorrelation;concatenation;hadamard transform;linear algebra;nonlinear system;recursion;software propagation	Pascale Charpin;Enes Pasalic	2002		10.1007/3-540-36492-7_13	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;autocorrelation;nonlinear system;computer science;mathematics;boolean function;algorithm;psychological resilience;statistics	Crypto	42.16230183272093	42.906342680314495	51727

Maximal entanglement EAQECCs can achieve the EA-hashing bound asymptotically. In this work, the construction of quaternary zero radical codes is discussed, including the construction of lowdimensional quaternary codes for all code lengths and higherdimensional quaternary codes for short lengths. Using the obtained quaternary codes, we construct many maximal entanglement EAQECCs with very good parameters. Some of these EAQECCs are optimal codes, and some of them are better than previously known ones. Combining these results with known bounds, we formulate a table of upper and lower bounds on the minimum distance of any maximal entanglement EAQECCs with length up to 20 channel qubits.	code;error detection and correction;forward error correction;maximal set;optimal design;quantum capacity;quantum entanglement;quantum error correction;qubit	Liangdong Lu;Ruihu Li;Luobin Guo;Qiang Fu	2015	Quantum Information Processing	10.1007/s11128-014-0830-y	block code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;linear code;mathematics;quantum convolutional code;quantum mechanics	Theory	39.87377629741929	54.92229455038503	51738
a9dec10f67bafab304d52f5e8daa22c31339c089	the ring of k-regular sequences	k-regular sequence	The automatic sequence is the central concept at the intersection of formal language theory and number theory. It was introduced by Cobham (1969, 1972), and has been extensively studied by Christol et al. (1980) and other writers. Since the range of automatic sequences is finite, however, their descriptive power is severely limited. In this paper, we generalize the concept of automatic sequence to the case where the sequence can take its values in a (possibly infinite) ring R ; we call such sequences k-regular . (When R is finite, we obtain automatic sequences as a special case.) We argue that k -regular sequences provide a good framework for discussing many “naturally occurring” sequences, and we support this contention by exhibiting many examples of k -regular sequences from numerical analysis, topology, number theory, combinatorics, analysis of algorithms, and the theory of fractals. We investigate the closure properties of k -regular sequences. We prove that the set of k -regular sequences forms a ring under the operations of term-by-term addition and convolution. Hence, the set of associated formal power series in R [[ X ]] also forms a ring. We show how k -regular sequences are related to Z -rational formal series. We give a machine model for the k -regular sequences. We prove that all k -regular sequences can be computed quickly. Let the pattern sequence e P ( n ) count the number of occurrences of the pattern P in the base- k expansion of n . Morton and Mourant (1989) showed that every sequence over Z has a unique expansion as a sum of pattern sequences. We prove that this “Fourier” expansion maps k -regular sequences to k -regular sequences. [This can be viewed as a generalizaiton of results of Choffrut and Schützenberger (1988), and previous results of Allouche et al. (1992)]. In particular, the coefficients in the expansion of e p ( an + b ) form a k -automatic sequence. Many natural examples and some open problems are given.

Our discussion is restricted to the single-source multicast case. We define the minimum distance of a network error correction code. This plays the same role as it does in classical coding theory. We construct codes that can correct errors up to the full error correction capability specified by Singleton bound for network error correction codes recently established by Cai and Yeung. We propose a decoding principle for network error correction codes, based on which we introduce two decoding algorithms and analyze their performance. We formulate the global kernel error correction problem and characterize the error correction capability of codes for this kind of error.	algorithm;code;coding theory;ecc memory;error detection and correction;error message;forward error correction;multicast;singleton bound	Zhen Zhang	2008	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2007.909139	block code;concatenated error correction code;turbo code;low-density parity-check code;error detection and correction;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;cyclic code;serial concatenated convolutional codes;linear code;mathematics;forward error correction;error floor;reed–solomon error correction;algorithm;statistics	Vision	39.51903138511117	58.497632975422036	52110

We call these sequences state m sequences. Theoretical lower and upper bounds on the peaks of the Hamming cross-correlation functions of those sequences, which are often used in frequency-hopped spread-spectrum systems, are derived. Numerical results in support of the theory are presented, and it is shown that the worst-case shift of the cross-correlation for relatively short sequences is of burst nature. The state position mapped (SPM) sequences of the state m -sequences are introduced. Their suitability for OR-channel code division multiplexing is numerically examined. The behavior of the periodic crosscorrelation function of these SPM sequences is used as the basis for judging their performance. It is explained also that the lower bound on the peak of the periodic Hamming cross-correlation function of the state m -sequences is naturally a lower bound on the peak of the periodic crosscorrelation function of SPM state m -sequences. This is due to the general relationship (a decimation relationship) between the two types of correlation functions. This relationship is explained and illustrated by an example. Tables of the peaks of both cross-correlation functions are presented for all sets of sequences for sequence generators of 5, 6, 7, and 8 stages.	cross-correlation	A. A. Shaar;Chris F.

Such codes are of current practical interest as they enable optical communication at lower chip rate. To simplify practical implementation, the AM-OPPW (at most one-pulse per wavelength) restriction is often appended to a 2-D OOC. An AM-OPPW 2-D OOC is optimal if its size is the largest possible. In this paper, the notion of a perfect AM-OPPW 2-D OOC is proposed, which is an optimal <i>(n</i>x<i>m</i>, <i>k</i>, ¿) AM-OPPW 2-D OOC with cardinality <i>[(m</i> <sup>¿</sup> <i>n</i>(<i>n</i>-1)...(<i>n</i>-¿))/(<i>k</i>(<i>k</i>-1)...(<i>k</i>-¿))] . A link between optimal <i>(n</i>x<i>m</i>, <i>k</i>, ¿) AM-OPPW 2-D OOCs and block designs is developed.

Several new infinite families of perfect <i>(n</i>x<i>m</i>, <i>k</i>, 1) AM-OPPW 2-D OOCs with <i>k</i> ¿ {2, 3, 4} are thus produced.	am broadcasting;code (cryptography);modulo operation	Jianmin Wang;Jianxing Yin	2010	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2010.2043772	telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;algorithm;optical communication	Theory	42.909018767607165	53.156451881615034	52142

Super-position of permutations provides the addition of this arithmetic. Addition if facilitated by complete permutations with a certain “splitting” property, allowing them to be pulled apart and reassembled. The split permutations also provide a singular direct product for complete permutations in conjunction with the multiplication (direct product) of the arithmetic which itself derives from that for perfect systems of difference sets.  We pay special attention to complete permutations satisfying constraints both fixed and variable; this is equivalent to embedding partial complete permutations in complete permutations. In the sequel, using this arithmetic, we investigate the spectra of certain constraints with respect to central integral bases which are of interest for the purpose of giving further constructions either of complete permutations with constraints or of irregular, extremel perfect systems of difference sets.

5611c3a4f22f72a87a25cac94648afa9710010d7	new bounds for perfect hashing via information theory	information theory	Abstract   A set of sequences of length  t  from a  b -element alphabet is called  k-separated  if for every  k -tuple of the sequences there exists a coordinate in which they all differ. The problem of finding, for fixed  t ,  b , and  k , the largest size  N ( t ,  b ,  k ) of a  k -separated set of sequences is equivalent to finding the minimum size of a ( b ,  k )-family of perfect hash functions for a set of a given size. We shall improve the bounds for  N ( t ,  b ,  k ) obtained by Fredman and Komlos [1].  Korner [2] has shown that the proof in [1] can be reduced to an application of the sub-additivity of graph entropy [3]. He also pointed out that this sub-additivity yields a method to prove non-existence bounds for graph covering problems. Our new non-existence bound is based on an extension of graph entropy to hypergraphs.	information theory;perfect hash function	János Körner;Katalin Marton	1988	Eur. J.

We provide bounds on the number of operations per decoded bit, and show that this number is dependent on the weight hierarchy of the linear block code associated with the parallel transitions. The complexity of the new decoding method for PUM codes is compared to the complexity of Viterbi decoding of comparable punctured convolutional codes. Examples from a special class of PUM codes show that the new decoding method compare favorably to Viterbi decoding of punctured codes.	block code;convolutional code;soft-decision decoder;trellis quantization;viterbi decoder	M.

045326a537be4cc4cfd49e5e91dbe500c4fe14c6	classifying unrooted gaussian trees under privacy constraints		In this work, our objective is to find out how topological and algebraic properties of unrooted Gaussian tree models determine their security robustness, which is measured by our proposed max-min information (MaMI) metric. Such metric quantifies the amount of common randomness extractable through public discussion between two legitimate nodes under an eavesdropper attack. We show some general topological properties that the desired max-min solutions shall satisfy. Under such properties, we develop conditions under which comparable trees are put together to form partially ordered sets (posets). Each poset contains the most favorable structure as the poset leader, and the least favorable structure. Then, we compute the Tutte-like polynomial for each tree in a poset in order to assign a polynomial to any tree in a poset. Moreover, we propose a novel method, based on restricted integer partitions, to effectively enumerate all poset leaders. The results not only help us understand the security strength of different Gaussian trees, which is critical when we evaluate the information leakage issues for various jointly Gaussian distributed measurements in networks, but also provide us both an algebraic and a topological perspective in grasping some fundamental properties of such models.	enumerated type;information leakage;linear algebra;maxima and minima;polynomial;randomness;spectral leakage	Ali Moharrer;Shuangqing Wei;George T.

In this decoder, it simplifies the step of calculating the condition and avoids calculating the unknown syndrome, thereby yielding a fast algebraic decoder for correcting four possible errors. Moreover, while using the proposed algorithm, if uses the channel measurement information proposed by Chase to sequentially invert the bits of the received word until one of the errors is cancelled for the five-error case and apply the new algebraic decoding algorithm mentioned above to correct the remaining four errors, the algorithm has been verified through a software simulation in C-language. The simulation shows that the decoding scheme developed here is more efficient than the previous decoding algorithm developed for the (71, 36, 11) QR code and it is naturally suitable for software implementation.	quadratic residue code	Tsung-Ching Lin;Hsin-Chiu Chang;Yong Li;Jack Shen-Kuen Chang;Trieu-Kien Truong	2016	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2015.0159	list decoding;discrete mathematics;soft-decision decoder;sequential decoding;computer science;theoretical computer science;berlekamp–welch algorithm;algorithm	Crypto	43.136945205501064	59.90133515881439	52831

A partial permutation of length n with k holes is a sequence of symbols π = π1π2 · · ·πn in which each of the symbols from the set {1, 2, . . . , n − k} appears exactly once, while the remaining k symbols of π are “holes”. We introduce pattern-avoidance in partial permutations and prove that most of the previous results on Wilf equivalence of permutation patterns can be extended to partial permutations with an arbitrary number of holes. We also show that Baxter permutations of a given length k correspond to a Wilftype equivalence class with respect to partial permutations with (k − 2) holes. Lastly, we enumerate the partial permutations of length n with k holes avoiding a given pattern of length at most four, for each n ≥ k ≥ 1.	baxter (robot);enumerated type;permutation pattern;project 25;string (computer science);turing completeness;type system	Anders Claesson;Vít Jelínek;Eva Jelínková;Sergey Kitaev	2011	Electr.

We first propose a robust reconstruction for polynomials from erroneous residues when the degrees of all residue errors are small, namely robust Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) for polynomials. It basically says that a polynomial can be reconstructed from erroneous residues such that the degree of the reconstruction error is upper bounded by τ whenever the degrees of all residue errors are upper bounded by τ, where a sufficient condition for τ and a reconstruction algorithm are obtained. By relaxing the constraint that all residue errors have small degrees, another robust reconstruction is then presented when there are multiple unrestricted errors and an arbitrary number of errors with small degrees in the residues. By making full use of redundancy in moduli, we obtain a stronger residue error correction capability in the sense that apart from the number of errors that can be corrected in the previous existing result, some errors with small degrees can be also corrected in the residues. With this newly obtained result, improvements in uncorrected error probability and burst error correction capability in a data transmission are illustrated.	algorithm;burst error;cathode ray tube;code;error detection and correction;forward error correction;polynomial remainder theorem	Li Xiao;Xiang-Gen Xia	2015	2015 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	10.1109/ISIT.2015.7282441	combinatorics;non-sampling error;discrete mathematics;error detection and correction;probability of error;error bar;round-off error;mathematics;encoding;statistics;robustness;polynomial	Embedded	40.29708482377176	57.61623126920099	53048

Considered models have in common to be related to continuous dynamical systems. 1 Dynamical Systems and Polynomial Cauchy Problems A polynomial Cauchy problem is a Cauchy problem of type { x′ = p(x, t) x(0) = x0 where p(x, t) is a vector of polynomials, and x0 is some initial condition. The class of functions that are solution of a polynomial Cauchy problem turns out to be a very robust class [14]. It contains almost all natural mathematical functions. It is closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, composition, differentiation, and compositional inverse [14]. Actually, every continuous time dynamical system x′ = f(x, t) where each component of f is defined as a composition of functions in the class and polynomials can be shown equivalent to a (possibly higher dimensional) polynomial Cauchy problem [14]. This implies that almost all continuous time dynamical systems considered in books like [16], or [21] can be turned in the form of (possibly higher dimensional) polynomial Cauchy problems. For example, consider the dynamic of a pendulum x′′ + p sin(x) = 0. Because of the sin function, this is not directly a polynomial ordinary differential equation. However, define y = x′, z = sin(x), u = cos(x). A simple computation of derivatives show that we must have  x′ = y y′ = −pz z′ = yu u′ = −yz , which is a polynomial ordinary differential equation. ? This work has been partially supported by French Ministry of Research through ANR Project SOGEA. This class of dynamical systems becomes even more interesting if one realizes that it captures all what can be computed by some models of continuous time machines, such as the General Purpose Analog Computer (GPAC) of Shannon [25].	ambiguous name resolution;book;computation;computational model;dynamical system;gpac;general purpose analog computer;initial condition;polynomial;shannon (unit);universality probability	Jérôme Olivier Durand-Lose	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-74593-8_2	computer simulation;computational science;simulation;computer science;computational mechanics;dynamical system;computational resource;computational physics;computational model	Theory	53.44457905937768	35.2629391802921	53111

A QRD is extensively adopted by the detection of multiple-input-multiple-output systems. In order to achieve computational efficiency with robust numerical stability, a triangular systolic array (TSA) for QRD of large-size matrices is presented. In addition, the TSA architecture can be modified into an iterative architecture that is called IQRD for reducing hardware cost. The IQRD hardware is constructed by the diagonal and the triangular process with fewer gate counts and lower power consumption than TSAQRD. For a 4 t 4 matrix, the hardware area of the proposed IQRD can reduce about 41% of the gate counts in TSAQRD. For a generic square matrix of order m IQRD, the latency required is 2m - 1 time units, which is based on the MGS algorithm. Thus, the total clock latency is only 10 m - 5 cycles.	algorithm;iterative method;mimo;qr decomposition;schmidt decomposition	Robert Chen-Hao Chang;Chih-Hung Lin;Kuang-Hao Lin;Alex Chien-Lin Huang;Feng-Chi Chen	2010	IEEE Trans. on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/TCSI.2010.2047744	receiver;design;mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;systolic array;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;qr decomposition;numerical stability;wireless	EDA	32.45786193172358	58.373216249703326	53235

Actually, such a statement needs to be qualified. In fact, if a computer engineer designs an adder on this basis, he would probably find that the average add time is not as short as the theoretical analysis would lead him to expect. This is because Briley's analysis, and that of his predecessors Burks, Goldstine, and von Neumann [1], are both dependenent on the assumption that the numbers being added are evenly distributed among 2n possible bit combinations. In actual computation, most of the integers tend to have small magnitudes. Thus, a negative integer, if expressed in complement form, tends to have a long string of leading ones. When two such numbers are added, or when one of these is added to a positive integer giving a positive sum, a long string of carries would be generated. This means that in real computing situations the average carry might be much longer than Briley's analysis would indicate."""		Chung-Kwong Yuen	1974	IEEE Trans.

While TSC, MSC, TAE, and Csum are equivalent optimization metrics over the real/complex field, our developments show that such equivalence does not hold, in general, over the quaternary field. We establish conditions on the number of signatures and signature length under which simultaneous optimization can or cannot be possible.	mathematical optimization;remote desktop services;turing completeness;type signature	Ming Li;Stella N.

The application of the criterion may drastically reduce the number of reductions of polynomials in the course of the algorithm.

The aim of this short notice is to correct some errors in the paper “Plane fundamental domains with minimal perimeters” which was published in this journal [1]. After thorough study it was Endre Makai Jr. who discovered some problems in the table belonging to Theorem 1. He realized that at some critical cases where the optimal solution depends on the affine parameters the given perimeters do not coincide albeit the perimeter-function should be continuous. He immediately asked me about the reasons and I gave him the following correction. For completeness I repeat the theorem, too. Theorem 1. There are 13 plane crystallographic groups, where the fundamental domain, having minimal perimeter, is unique. For the groups pg, cm, pmg and pgg there are two possible planigon types which serve the minimal perimeter according to the affine parameters. Our following table contains the complete list of the plane groups with the optimal planigon types, minimal perimeters and, if necessary, with conditions for the affine parameters. The problems were caused partly by miscount (the case of pg), partly by miswrites (cases cm, pmg). I am very grateful to Endre Makai Jr. for his valuable observation.

The circuit demultiplexes the input clock signal into ten phased output signals by streaming sets of twenty clock phases. A phase difference equal to the half period of the clock is maintained between consecutive output transitions. The VHDL description of the PDMUX10 cell is given and the simulation and synthesis results are generated. A 2-level tree-like structure is built by applying the phased outputs of the PDMUX10 cell into the corresponding clock inputs of ten cell replicas that extend the circuit behavior. An EXOR10 gate is attached to the PDMUX10 cell output ports and aggregates all the phases that the phased clock signals are carrying while preserving their phase associations.	clock signal;multiplexer;phased array;simulation;vhdl	Serafim Poriazis	2004	Proceedings of the 2004 11th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems, 2004.

The key idea of the new designs is to use short -ary sequences of period with the two-level autocorrelation function together with the interleaved structure to construct a set of long sequences with the desired properties. The resulting sequences are interleaved sequences of period. There are cyclically shift distinct sequences in each family. The maximal correlation value is 2 +3 which is optimal with respect to the Welch bound. Each sequence in the family is balanced and has large linear span. In particular, for binary case, cross/out-of-phase autocorrelation values belong to the set 1 + 2 2 + 3 2 1 , any sequence where the short sequences are quadratic residue sequences achieves the maximal linear span. It is shown that some families of these sequences can be implemented efficiently in both hardware and software.	autocorrelation;computer hardware;cross-correlation;grammatical framework;maximal set;quadratic residue;welch's method	Guang Gong	2002	IEEE Trans.

The intrinsic advantages of UTB SOI technology versus bulk CMOS technology with regard to the stability and variability of 6T SRAM cells for subthreshold operation are analyzed. Compared with LER, WFV causes comparable threshold voltage variation and much smaller subthreshold swing fluctuation, hence less impact on the UTB SOI subthreshold SRAMs. Even considering LER, the Lg=40 nm UTB SOI 6T subthreshold SRAM cells still provide sufficient margin (μRSNM/σRSNM >; 6 at Vdd=0.3 ~ 0.4 V) while the bulk subthreshold SRAMs with RDF fail to maintain adequate margin. Increasing temperature will increase the Vread, 0 and decrease RSNM because of the degraded subthreshold swing. The RSNM of UTB SOI subthreshold SRAMs show less temperature sensitivity compared with that of bulk subthreshold SRAMs. Due to larger body effect, the back-gating technique is more efficient for the Lg=40 nm and 25 nm UTB SOI subthreshold SRAMs compared with the bulk counterparts. By using lower threshold voltage devices with dual band-gap work functions, the Lg=25 nm UTB SOI subthreshold SRAMs show 31.9% reduction in σRSNM and 55% improvement in μRSNM/σRSNM.	bounded variation;cmos;heart rate variability;multiprotocol label switching;quantum fluctuation;silicon on insulator;spatial variability;static random-access memory	Vita Pi-Ho Hu;Ming-Long Fan;Pin Su;Ching-Te Chuang	2011	IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems	10.1109/JETCAS.2011.2163691	embedded system;electronic engineering;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	52.96236474680865	44.88462357011667	54558

In particular, Ambainis et al. (in: Proceedings of the thirty-third annual ACM symposium on theory of computing, 2001) showed that in the \((\mathbb {Z},C_1,H)\) quantum walk (one-dimensional Hadamard walk) an absorbing boundary partially reflects information. These authors also conjectured that the left absorption probabilities \(P_n^{(1)}(1,0)\) related to the finite absorbing Hadamard walks \((\mathbb {Z},C_1,H,\{ 0,n\} )\) satisfy a linear fractional recurrence in n (here \(P_n(1,0)\) is the probability that a Hadamard walk particle initialized in \(|1\rangle |R\rangle \) is eventually absorbed at \(|0\rangle \) and not at \(|n\rangle \)). This result, as well as a third-order linear recurrence in initial position m of \(P_n^{(m)}(1,0)\), was later proved by Bach and Borisov (Absorption probabilities for the two-barrier quantum walk, 2009, arXiv:0901.4349) using techniques from complex analysis. In this paper, we extend these results to general two-state quantum walks and three-state Grover walks, while providing a partial calculation for absorption in d-dimensional Grover walks by a \(d-1\)-dimensional wall. In the one-dimensional cases, we prove partial reflection of information, a linear fractional recurrence in lattice size, and a linear recurrence in the initial position.	quantum walk	Parker Kuklinski;Mark Kon	2018	Quantum Information Processing	10.1007/s11128-018-2017-4	generating function;quantum walk;hadamard transform;quantum mechanics;lattice (order);hadamard product;physics	Theory	41.3517061511031	36.648425539739634	54681

The Smart Substrate strategy is compared to an alternative approach based on the assumption that system components are perfect (“Known Good Die (KGD)” approach).

Introduction In this note we show how the use of some simple ideas from the area of subgroup growth of pro-finite groups can be used to give new proofs and new results on counting elements in the symmetric group. More specifically, let Sn be the symmetric group on n letters. For x ∈ Sn, denote by o(x) the order of x, i.e. the l.c.m. of the lengths of its cycles. If P is a set of primes, we say that x is a P-element (resp: P′-element) if only (resp: no) primes from P divides o(x). We also define P′ to be the complement set of primes. Let: σP(n) = |{x ∈ Sn : x is a P-element}|, σP(0) = 1, σ′P(n) = |{x ∈ Sn : x is a P′-element}|, σ′P(0) = 1, and for m ∈ N denote: σm(n) = |{x ∈ Sn : x = 1}|, σm(0) = 1. For a finite set of integers we define: ‖B‖ = ∏b∈B b, and ‖B‖ = 1 if B = φ.	complement (complexity)	David el-Chai Ben-Ezra	2009	IJAC	10.1142/S021819670900510X	newton's identities;ca-group;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;group of lie type;elementary symmetric polynomial;automorphisms of the symmetric and alternating groups;cycle graph;covering groups of the alternating and symmetric groups;generating set of a group;mathematics;complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial;base;symmetric group;power sum symmetric polynomial;representation theory of the symmetric group;alternating group;stanley symmetric function;symmetric function;p-group;ring of symmetric functions;algebra	Theory	38.985794725479565	34.62236646468939	54857

A new 12-point FFT implementation is used to improve system performance significantly since it is one of the key modules in 3780-point FFT. Together with some other techniques such as optimized assembly code, this 3780-point FFT improves the throughput by 39.26% and reduces the number of instructions by 19.9% compared with the non-optimized method.

Given the Tanner graph (TG) of a NB-LDPC code, the selection of edge weights in the TG significantly affects the performance of the NB-LDPC code. The authors introduce an edge weight distribution (EWD) parameter for the TG of NB-LDPC codes. By utilising particle swarm optimisation (PSO), the EWD is optimised and it has been demonstrated that the optimal EWD approaches a two-element distribution for large field size and high average variable-node degree. With the optimised EWD, the authors construct a class of field-compatible LDPC (FC-LDPC) codes over GF(q) whose parity-check matrices only include elements 0, 1 and 2, and can be encoded and decoded over different field sizes. The simulations demonstrate that the performance of the proposed FC-LDPC codes improves monotonically with increasing field size, and significantly outperforms that of the corresponding algebraic NB-LDPC codes or NB-LDPC codes generated with uniform distribution of non-zero elements over GF(q).	low-density parity-check code	Guojun Han;Yong Liang Guan;Lingjun Kong;Kheong Sann Chan;Kui Cai	2014	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2014.0216	tanner graph;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;theoretical computer science;mathematics;statistics	Theory	41.8117191263763	59.679267706611654	55155
1b8483f4c0ac6bc12f14e70bfa3189ab84cddf51	on the enumeration of self-dual codes	self dual code	Abstract   We give the complete classification of all binary, self-dual, doubly-even (32, 16) codes. There are 85 non-equivalent, self-dual, doubly-even (32, 16) codes. Five of these have minimum weight 8, namely, a quadratic residue code and a Reed-Muller code, and three new codes. A set of generators is given for a code in each equivalence class together with its entire weight distribution and the order of its entire group with other information facilitating the computation of permutation generators. From this list it is possible to identify all self-dual codes of length less than 32 and the numbers of these are included.	code	John H. Conway;Vera Pless	1980	J. Comb. Theory, Ser.

This family contains the only known family for general parameters, the Gabidulin codes, and contains codes inequivalent to the Gabidulin codes. This family also contains the well-known family of semifields known as Generalised Twisted Fields. We also calculate the automorphism group of these codes, including the automorphism group of the Gabidulin codes.	code	John Sheekey	2016	Adv. in Math. of Comm.		block code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;linear code;expander code;mathematics;group code;algebra	Theory	40.14453206281536	53.44646675256455	55245

This is done by giving new proofs of expansion for three permutations of the Gabber–Galil expander. Our results give an expansion factor of 3 16 for subgraphs of these three-regular graphs with (p− 1)2 inputs for p prime. The proofs are not based on eigenvalue methods or higher algebra. The same methods show the expected number of probes for unsuccessful search in double hashing is bounded by 1 1−α , where α is the load factor. This assumes a double hashing scheme in which two hash functions are randomly and independently chosen from a specified uniform distribution. The result is valid regardless of the distribution of the inputs. This is analogous to Carter and Wegman’s result for hashing with chaining. This paper concludes by elaborating on how any sufficiently sized subset of inputs in any distribution expands in the subgraph of the Gabber–Galil graph expander of focus. This is related to any key distribution having expected 1 1−α probes for unsuccessful search for double hashing given the initial random, independent, and uniform choice of two universal hash functions.	cryptographic hash function;double hashing;edward wegman;hash table;key distribution;randomness;super expander;universal hashing	Phillip G.

The decomposition depends on the choice of d commuting projections {Pj}j=1, where Pj(f) does not depend on the variable xj . We present an explicit formula for fu, which is new even for the anova and anchored decompositions; both are special cases of the general decomposition. We show that the decomposition is minimal in the following sense: if f is expressible as a sum in which there is no term that depends on all of the variables indexed by the subset z, then, for every choice of {Pj}j=1, the terms fu = 0 for all subsets u containing z. Furthermore, in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space setting, we give sufficient conditions for the terms fu to be mutually orthogonal.	execution unit;hilbert space	Frances Y. Kuo;Ian H.

Many fundamental characteristics of chaos, such as ergodicity, mixing property and sensitivity to initial conditions/control parameters [Hao, 1993], can be connected with some cryptographic properties of good ciphers, such as confusion/diffusion, balance and avalanche property [Schneier, 1996]. As a new source of cryptography, chaos has attracted much attention in recent years. Besides secure communication approaches based on chaos synchronization technique [G. Alvarez et al., 1999], the ideas of using digital (i.e., discrete-value discrete-time) chaotic systems to construct cryptosystems have also been proposed [E.

9837b31b103f5762e6cf516f6ec29ec559c52e40	computing the chromatic index of steiner triple systems	steiner triple system	A Steiner triple system of order v, denoted STS (v), is a pair (V, B); V is a u-set of elements and B is a collection of 3-subsets of V called blocks. Each unordered pair of elements is contained in precisely one block. There is a substantial body of research on STS, partially because of their wide applicability in the design of experiments, and in the theory of error-correcting codes. In the design of statistical experiments, each block corresponds to a 'test' of the three elements in the block. In this context, we can view disjoint blocks as tests which can be carried out simultaneously. In terms of STS, we define a colour class to be a set of pairwise disjoint blocks. A k-block colouring is a partition of the block set into k colour classes; the chromatic index is the least k for which such a colouring exists. In our example, the chromatic index is precisely the time required for the entire experiment. In other applications of STS, similar reasons exist for studying the chromatic index. The chromatic index of STS is also a problem of some interest in combinatorics as a restriction of certain investigations of set systems. In computer science, further motivation arises from the substantial interest in the chromatic index of graphs, and applications in scheduling (see Ref. 5 and references therein). The purpose of this note is to describe a method for computing the chromatic index of STS, and to describe results obtained in testing this method on small STS.	code;computer science;design of experiments;edge coloring;emoticon;error detection and correction;experiment;forward error correction;scheduling (computing);steiner tree problem	Charles J.

75ab82118974fa81fbab42b2913db949ce40b59c	the joint weight enumerator of an lcd code and its dual		A binary linear code is called LCD if it intersects its dual trivially. We show that the coefficients of the joint weight enumerator of such a code with its dual satisfy linear constraints, leading to a new linear programming bound on the size of an LCD code of given length and minimum distance. In addition, we show that this polynomial is, in general, an invariant of a matrix group of dimension 4 and order 12. Also, we sketch a Gleason formula for this weight enumerator. I. I NTRODUCTION A binary linear code is calledLCD if it intersects its dual trivially. These codes, introduced by Massey in [1], give an optimum linear coding solution for the two user binary adder channel. They were rediscovered recently in [2] in a context of countermeasures to passive and active side channel analyses on embedded crytosystems. While most studies so far are concerned with constructions, the recent article [3] contains a linea r programming bound on the size of a binary linear LCD code of given length and minimum distance. This bound is proved there to be sharper in many instances than the classical linear programming bound. In the present work, we will present a linear programming bound on the same quantity with variables being the coefficients of the joint weight enumerator of such a code with its dual. The advantage of using this fourvariable polynomial is that the condition of LCD-ness is now linear (instead of quadratic in [3]) and necessary and sufficient (instead of only necessary in [3]). In addition, we observe that the joint weight enumerator of a linear code and its dual is an invariant of a matrix group of dimension4 and order12, and sketch a Gleason formula for this weight enumerator. This seems to have been unnoticed since the seminal application of invariant theory to codes 50 years ago in [4]. The material is organized as follows. Section II collects the notation and the definitions needed in the following sections. Section III, of independent interest develops the invariant theory of the joint weight enumerator of a code and its dual. Section III establishes the linear programming bound with variables the coefficients of the joint weight enumerator of a LCD code and its dual, and validates it by improving the numerical results of [3]. II. D EFINITIONS AND NOTATION A. Codes In this work, all considered codes are binary and linear. A code of lengthn is thus subspace over the field GF (2) of the vector spaceGF (2). Thedual C of such a codeC ≤ GF (2) is defined with respect of the standard euclidean inner product as C = {y ∈ GF (2)| ∀x ∈ C, x.y = 0}. A binary linear codeC is Linear Complementary Dual (LCD) if C ⋂ C = 0. B. Weight distributions The Hamming weightof a binary vectorx of length n is the number of its nonzero coordinates. For i = 0, 1, · · · , n, the weight distributionAi of a binary code of lengthn is the number of code words with weight i. The weight enumerator of a code C is then	adder (electronics);binary code;bitwise operation;code (cryptography);code word;codec;coefficient;countermeasure (computer);earthbound;embedded system;enumerator polynomial;gleason's theorem;grammatical framework;linear code;linear programming;liquid-crystal display;numerical analysis;r language;semidefinite programming;side-channel attack;window function	Adel Alahmadi;Michel Deza;Mathieu Dutour Sikiric;Patrick Solé	2015	CoRR		enumerator polynomial;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;geometry;dual code	Theory	41.05758141097097	53.80839519689093	56823

This paper first generalizes the product construction to arbitrary number of levels. More importantly, the existence of a sequence of such lattices that are good for quantization and Poltyrev-good under multistage decoding is proved. This family of lattices is then used to generate a sequence of nested lattice codes based on the recent construction of Ordentlich and Erez. This allows one to achieve the same computation rate of Nazer and Gastpar for compute-and-forward with multistage decoding, which is termed multistage compute-and-forward.	cartesian closed category;code;computation;multistage amplifier;quantization (signal processing)	Yu-Chih Huang;Krishna R.

This article is an attempt at solving the problem using a computer algorithm. It is presented in a fashion that will hopefully allow for easy understanding for many people and scientists from many diverse fields. In technical terms, a novel method for solving k-SAT is explained. This method is primarily based on linear algebra and finite fields. Evidence is given that this method may require rougly O(n 3) time and space for deterministic models. More specifically the algorithm runs in time O(P · V (n + V) 2) with mistaking satisfiable Boolean expressions as unsatisfiable with an approximate probablity 1/Θ(V (n + V) 2) P , where n is the number of clauses and V is the number of variables. It's concluded that significant evidence exists that P=NP. There is a forum devoted to this paper at http://482527.ForumRomanum.com.

d619cb8dd81a0f42a5d983472072ed9f8c14e723	hamming correlation of higher order		We introduce a new measure of pseudorandomness, the (periodic) Hamming correlation of order begin{document}$ell$end{document} which generalizes the Hamming autocorrelation ( begin{document}$ell = 2$end{document} ). We analyze the relation between the Hamming correlation of order begin{document}$ell$end{document} and the periodic analog of the correlation measure of order begin{document}$ell$end{document} introduced by Mauduit and Sarkozy. Roughly speaking, the correlation measure of order begin{document}$ell$end{document} is a finer measure than the Hamming correlation of order begin{document}$ell$end{document} . However, the latter can be much faster calculated and still detects some undesirable linear structures. We analyze examples of sequences with optimal Hamming correlation and show that they have large Hamming correlation of order begin{document}$ell$end{document} for some very small begin{document}$ellu003e2$end{document} . Thus they have some undesirable linear structures, in particular in view of cryptographic applications such as secure communications.	window function	Ming Su;Arne Winterhof	2018	Adv. in Math. of Comm.	10.3934/amc.2018029	discrete mathematics;periodic graph (geometry);combinatorics;autocorrelation;mathematics;correlation;pseudorandomness;hamming code	Vision	42.035741642371676	46.44314449260805	57304

Inspired by a recent generalization to facet derangements of the hypercube by Gordon and McMahon, we generalize this problem to enumerating derangements in the wreath product of any finite cyclic group with the symmetric group. We also give qand (q, t)-analogs for cyclic derangements, generalizing results of Gessel, Brenti and Chow. 1 Derangements A derangement is a permutation that leaves no letter fixed. Algebraically, this is an element σ of the symmetric group Sn such that σ(i) 6= i for any i, or, equivalently, no cycle of σ has length 1. Geometrically, a derangement is an isometry in R of the regular (n − 1)-simplex that leaves no facet unmoved. Combinatorially, these are matrices with entries from {0, 1} such that each row and each column has exactly one nonzero entry and no diagonal entry is equal to 1. Let Dn denote the set of derangements in Sn, and let dn = |Dn|. The problem of counting derangements is the quintessential example of the principle of Inclusion-Exclusion [20]:	derangement;fixed point (mathematics)	Sami H. Assaf	2010	Electr. J. Comb.

We provide explicit formulae for isogenies with kernel isomorphic to (ℤ/2ℤ)3 (over an algebraic closure of the base field) for any hyperelliptic genus 3 curve over a field of characteristic not 2 or 3. These isogenies are rational for a positive fraction of all hyperelliptic genus 3 curves defined over a finite field of characteristic p>3. Subject to reasonable assumptions, our constructions give an explicit and efficient reduction of instances of the DLP from hyperelliptic to non-hyperelliptic Jacobians for around 18.57% of all hyperelliptic genus 3 curves over a given finite field. We conclude with a discussion on extending these ideas to isogenies with more general kernels.	digital light processing;discrete logarithm;genus (mathematics);jacobian matrix and determinant;linear algebra	Benjamin A.

Find a small (ideally constant) set of linear transformations from Fn to itself {Ai}iisinI such that for every linear subspace V C Fn of dimension dim(V) < n/2 we have dim (SigmaiisinIAi(V)) ges(1+alpha)ldrdim(V), where alpha > 0 is some constant. In other words, the dimension of the subspace spanned by {Ai(V)}iisinI should be at least (1 + alpha) ldr dim(V). For fields of characteristic zero Lubotzky and Zelmanov completely solved the problem by exhibiting a set of matrices, of size independent of n, having the dimension expansion property. In this paper we consider the finite field version of the problem and obtain the following results. 1. We give a constant number of matrices that expand the dimension of every subspace of dimension d < n/2 by a factor of (1 + 1/logn). 2. We give a set of O(log n) matrices with expanding factor of' (1 + alpha), for some constant alpha > 0.

In this paper, we consider the same problem in a new way. B sed on polar decomposition of the multiplicative group ofF22m, we propose a new construction of Boolean functions with opt imal algebraic immunity. By a slight modification of it, we obtain a class of balanced Boolean functions achieving optimal algebraic immunity, which also have opti mal algebraic degree and high nonlinearity.

Linear SEC-DED codes widely used for design of reliable memories cannot detect and can miscorrect lots of errors with large Hamming weights. This may be a serious disadvantage for many modern technologies when error distributions are hard to estimate and multibit errors are highly probable. The proposed protection architectures have fewer undetectable errors and fewer errors that are miscorrected by all codewords than architectures based on linear codes with the same dimension at the cost of a small increase in the latency penalty, the area overhead and the power consumption. The nonlinear SEC-DED codes are generalized from the existing perfect nonlinear codes (Vasil’ev codes, Probl Kibern 8:375–378, 1962; Phelps codes, SIAM J Algebr Discrete Methods 4:398–403, 1983; and the codes based on one switching constructions, Etzion and Vardy, IEEE Trans Inf Theory 40:754–763, 1994).

In particular, distributivity holds if positive numbers are used, but does not hold for negative numbers in radix complement form. Use of simple recoding methods to achieve distributivity is not helpful, since costs of elementary multipliers and summing networks are increased. Distributivity does hold for the digit sets used for signed-digit arithmetic, and the requirement for distributivity provides guidance for the design of elementary multipliers.	method of complements	James E.

The state sequential network by framing the logic for state variable has found wide usage in the sequence or code generation, counting, and sequence recognition or decoding. Thus, the logical design by shifting the registered bits from the physical or storage element exhibits the concept of shift register in the general sequential network. The shift register provided with the suitable feedback logic, capable of generating long string of binary digit possessing quasi-random properties. The high-speed communication cryptography, stream cipher, test pattern generator, image encryption, cyclic redundancy check (CRC) operation and Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) encoder require the generation of random numbers in which the FSR have been utilised.

Both these algorithms use modular arithmetic. Recently, Fürer gave an O(N • log N • 2O(log*N)) algorithm which however uses arithmetic over complex numbers as opposed to modular arithmetic. In this paper, we use multivariate polynomial multiplication along with ideas from Fürer's algorithm to achieve this improvement in the modular setting. Our algorithm can also be viewed as a p-adic version of Fürer's algorithm. Thus, we show that the two seemingly different approaches to integer multiplication, modular and complex arithmetic, are similar.	fürer's algorithm;matrix multiplication;polynomial ring;root of unity;schönhage–strassen algorithm;strassen algorithm;time complexity	Anindya De;Piyush P.

0546a7a08b8519e8450fbdd7a9ba8d14961b6581	kronecker coefficients via symmetric functions and constant term identities	constant term;kronecker coefficients;symmetric functions	This work lies accross three areas of investigation that are by themselves of independent interest. A problem that arose in quantum computing led us to a link that tied these areas together. This link led to the calculation of some Kronecker coefficients by computing constant terms and conversely the computations of certain constant terms by computing Kronecker coefficients by symmetric function methods. This led to results as well as methods for solving numerical problems in each of these separate areas. Introduction An outstanding yet unsolved problem is to obtain a combinatorial rule for the computation of the integers cλλ(1),λ(2),...,λ(k) = 1 n! ∑ σ∈Sn χ (1) (σ)χ (2) (σ) · · ·χλ(k)(σ)χλ(σ) I.1 where χ and each χ (i) are irreducible Young characters of Sn. Let us recall that the pointwise product of any number of characters χ, χ, . . . , χ of the symmetric group Sn is also a character of Sn, and we shall denote it here by χ ∗χ(2) ∗ · · · ∗χ(k). This is usually called the “Kronecker ” product of χ, χ, . . . , χ. Thus I.1 may written as cλλ(1),λ(2),...,λ(k) = 〈 χ (1) ∗ χλ(2) ∗ · · · ∗ χλ(k) , χ 〉 . I.2 This integer gives the multiplicity of χ in the Kronecker product χ (1) ∗ χλ(2) ∗ · · · ∗ χλ(k) . Using the Frobenius map F that sends the irreducible character χ onto the Schur function Sλ, we can define the Kronecker product of two homogeneous symmetric functions of the same degree f and g by setting f ∗ g = F ( (F−1f) ∗ (F−1g) ) With this notation the coefficient in I.6 may also be written in the form cλλ(1),λ(2),...,λ(k) = 〈 sλ(1) ∗ sλ(2) ∗ · · · ∗ sλ(k) , sλ 〉 I.3 where 〈 , 〉 denotes the customary Hall scalar product of symmetric polynomials. This is the vehicle that reduces the computation of Kronecker coefficients to symmetric function manipulations. A problem which arose in quantum computing (see [6], [7], [12] and [13]) requires the explicit evaluation of the following generating function of Kronecker products. Wk(q) = ∑ d≥0 q 〈 sd,d ∗ sd,d ∗ · · · ∗ sd,d , s2d 〉 I.4 where, in each term, the Kronecker product has k factors. Here and after we will refer to the task of constructing Wk(q) as the “Sdd Problem ”. Kronecker Coefficients A. Garsia, N. Wallach, G. Xin, & M. Zabrocki may 20, 2008 2 It is well known (see [6] and [7]) and it is an easy consequence of Moliens theorem (see [3]) that all these series can (in principle) be obtained from the following constant term identity. Wk(q) = ∏k i=1 ( 1 − ai ) ∏ S⊆[1,k] ( 1 − q ∏i∈S ai/∏j ∈Saj) ∣∣∣ a1a 0 2···ak I.5 To this date these series have only been obtained for 1 ≤ k ≤ 5. They are as follows W2(q) = 1 1 − q2 , W3(q) = 1 1 − q4 , W4(q) = 1 (1 − q2)(1 − q4)2(1 − q6) and W5( √ q) = P5(q) (1 − q2)4(1 − q3)(1 − q4)6(1 − q5)(1 − q6)5 with P5(q) = q + q + 16q + 9q + 98q + 154q + 465q + 915q + 2042q + 3794q + 7263q + 12688q + 21198q + 34323q + 52205q + 77068q + 108458q + 147423q + 191794q + 241863q + 292689q + 342207q + 386980q + 421057q + 443990q + 451398q + 443990q + 421057q + 386980q + 342207q + 292689q + 241863q + 191794q + 147423q + 108458q + 77068q + 52205q + 34323q + 21198q + 12688q + 7263q + 3794q + 2042q + 915q + 465q + 154q + 98q + 9q + 16q + q + 1 Clearly, the result for W2(q) is immediate from the definition in I.4. Moreover W3(q), W4(q) can be easily obtained by computing the constant term in I.5 with “Omega” Package of Andrews et. al. However, the explosion of complexity from k = 4 to k = 5 required more powerfull machinery. The calculation of W5(q) using I.5 was first carried out by J-G. Luque and J. Y. Thibon (see [7]) by the partial fraction algorithm of G. Xin. We understand (personal communication by J. Y. Thibon) that the original calculation took a few hours with the computers they used at that time. Nowdays, by means of some combinatorial reductions (see [3]), the computation of W5(q) can be reduced to a few minutes. Nevertheless to this date, the evaluation of W6(q) by I.5, appears out of reach of our computers. The present paper resulted from a continuing effort to determine these series by symmetric function methods. We cover here a number of results and techniques that have emerged from this effort. Our first result in this direction may be stated as follows.

Let $\Omega = n$ for ${\mathbb G} = {\mathbb Q}_n$ and $\Omega = 2n$ for ${\mathbb G} = {\mathbb Z}^n$ denote the degree of ${\mathbb G}$. We use the lace expansion to prove that for both ${\mathbb G} = {\mathbb Q}_n$ and ${\mathbb G} = {\mathbb Z}^n$, \[p_c({\mathbb G}) = \Omega^{-1} + \Omega^{-2} + \frac{7}{2} \Omega^{-3} + O(\Omega^{-4}).\] This extends by two terms the result $p_c({\mathbb Q}_n) = \Omega^{-1} + O(\Omega^{-2})$ of Borgs, Chayes, van der Hofstad, Slade and Spencer, and provides a simplified proof of a previous result of Hara and Slade for ${\mathbb Z}^n$.	percolation theory	Remco van der Hofstad;Gordon Slade	2006	Combinatorics, Probability & Computing	10.1017/S0963548306007498	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;critical value;topology;mathematics	HPC	30.004584117154415	32.61472439654455	59552
6afdb8a78cb0021e81b7dd3edea5e9043bae04a6	generalized subspace subcodes with application in cryptology		Most of the codes that have an algebraic decoding algorithm are derived from the Reed Solomon codes. They are obtained by taking equivalent codes, for example the generalized Reed Solomon codes, or by using the so-called subfield subcode method, which leads to Alternant codes and Goppa codes over the underlying prime field, or over some intermediate subfield. The main advantages of these constructions is to preserve both the minimum distance and the decoding algorithm of the underlying Reed Solomon code. In this paper, we propose a generalization of the subfield subcode construction by introducing the notion of subspace subcodes and a generalization of the equivalence of codes which leads to the notion of generalized subspace subcodes. When the dimension of the selected subspaces is equal to one, we show that our approach gives exactly the family of the codes obtained by equivalence and subfield subcode technique. However, our approach highlights the links between the subfield subcode of a code defined over an extension field and the operation of puncturing the $q$-ary image of this code. When the dimension of the subspaces is greater than one, we obtain codes whose alphabet is no longer a finite field, but a set of r-uples. We explain why these codes are practically as efficient for applications as the codes defined on an extension of degree r. In addition, they make it possible to obtain decodable codes over a large alphabet having parameters previously inaccessible. As an application, we give some examples that can be used in public key cryptosystems such as McEliece.	algorithm;folded reed–solomon code;linear algebra;mceliece cryptosystem;public-key cryptography;puncturing;reed–solomon error correction;turing completeness	Thierry P.

Due to the feedback mechanism, conventional statistical procedures cannot be applied to infer the average power of sequential circuits. As a remedy, we propose a sequential procedure to determine an independence interval which is used to generate an independent and identically distributed (iid) power sample. A distribution-independent stopping criterion is applied to choose an appropriate convergent sample size. The proposed technique is applied to a set of sequential benchmark circuits and demonstrates high accuracy and efficiency.	benchmark (computing);feedback	Li-Pen Yuan;Sung-Mo Kang	1997		10.1145/263272.263340	sequential estimation;independent and identically distributed random variables;sample size determination;sampling;mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;power analysis;dissipation;feedback loop;sequential logic;combinational logic;finite-state machine;statistics	EDA	24.857526133559503	55.21209375650429	59589

Birkhoff states that every doubly-stochastic matrix can be expressed as a convex combination of permutation matrices. An even doublystochastic matrix is (by definition) a convex combination of even permutation matrices. All matrices considered are of order n x ~1, n 3 1. Using the Kroneckerdelta, we always identify a permutation rr with the perumutation matrix (&,i,j). S, and A,, denote the symmetric and alternating group of degree n respectively. L. Mirsky has found the following necessary condition for a matrix A = (a,) to be an even doubly-stochastic one, cf.

We study analogous but more demanding representations in case the alphabet size may be limited and yet the full intersection has to be determined from the coincidences.

In interval encoding the codeword is indexed by the interval since the last previous occurrence of that message, and the codeword set must be countably infinite. In recency rank encoding the codeword is indexed by the number of distinct messages in that interval, and there must be no fewer codewords than messages. The decoder decodes each codeword on receipt. Users need not know message probabilities, but must agree on indexings, of the codeword set in an order of increasing length and of the message set in some arbitrary order. The average codeword length over a communicat ions bout is never much larger than the value for an off-line scheme which maps the jth most frequent message in the bout into the jth shortest codeword in the given set, and is never too much larger than the value for off-line Huffman encoding of messages into the best codeword set for the bout message frequencies. Both schemes can do much better than Huffman coding when successive selections of each message type cluster much more than in the independent case.	code word;data compression;encoder;huffman coding;map;online and offline	Peter Elias	1987	IEEE Trans.

Only the distance bound data is considered, connecting nodes only if the file contains a bound for the corresponding inter-atomic distance. Since NMR provides bounds for spatially-close atom pairs, the structure of the NMR graph depends heavily on the molecule's 3D shape. Therefore, understanding NMR graph topology is relevant to 3D structure prediction. We examine NMR graphs for nine molecules, sizes ranging between 195 and 1178 nodes. Three categories of topological properties are studied: connected components, diameter, and node-degree sequence. Several interesting observations emerged when relating the diameter and maximum degree to the size of the graph.	connected component (graph theory);degree (graph theory);diameter (protocol);resonance;topological graph theory	Paulius Micikevicius;Narsingh Deo	2007	2007 IEEE 7th International Symposium on BioInformatics and BioEngineering	10.1109/BIBE.2007.4375736	combinatorics;connected component;topology;graph theory;mathematics	Theory	29.34671222809904	36.81016155651075	59771

These future mobile systems employ multiple wireless communication standards, which are different by means of algorithms that are used to implement the baseband processing and the channel decoding. Efficient implementation of multiple wireless standards in mobile terminals requires energyefficient and flexible hardware. We propose to implement both the baseband processing and channel decoding in a heterogeneous reconfigurable system-on-chip. The system-on-chip contains many processing elements of different granularities, which includes our coarse-grained reconfigurable MONTIUM architecture. We already showed the feasibility to implement the baseband processing of OFDM and WCDMA based communication systems in the MONTIUM. In this paper we implemented two kinds of channel decoders in the same MONTIUM architecture: Viterbi and Turbo decoding.	algorithm;baseband;binary decoder;mobile phone;overhead (computing);reconfigurable computing;smart card;system on a chip;viterbi algorithm;viterbi decoder	Gerard K.

Due to fast edge rates the spectral content of the signals is in the GHz range. High speed transceivers must have low voltage differential U 0 to meet fast data transfer rates over longer transmission lines. Such devices with high pin count and data rates above OC3/STS3 are sensitive to pin to pin skew on the Automatic Test Equipment (ATE). Many factors have to be taken into account during test development phase to capture and test the above signal conditions. Transmission line effects are one of the key parameters to be accounted for load board design. Test instrumentation and their limitations are another important resource. RLIS. With technology improvements in CMOS design, mass production of high speed devices will happen in the immediate future.

The FALCON is entirely based on a modular signal processing concept. In particular, the receiver deploys modules which process and generate log-likelihood ratio (LLR) signals, hence, providing the capability of a plug-and-play-type reconfigurability. To the best knowledge of the authors, such a reconfigurability approach has not yet been pursued as consequently before. The authors present their reconfigurability approach in this communication. The FALCON currently deploys commercial radio frequency (RF) front-ends provided by Atmel, analog and interface boards developed and implemented by the authors and DSP starter kits (DSK) with TI TMS320C6416 DSPs, provided by Texas Instruments. The hardware/software integration has been done in the laboratory of the authors as well as the development of all the signal processing modules, which have been realized in C language tailored for the TMS320C6416 DSPs (digital signal processors).

We consider a three-stage Clos network and assume that each link has a capacity of one (after normalization). The network is rearrangeable if for all possible sets of requests such that each input and output link generates a total weight not exceeding one, there always exists a set of paths, one for each request, such that the sum of weights of all paths going through a link does not exceed the link capacity. The question is to determine the minimum number of center switches which guarantees rearrangeability. We obtain a lower bound of 11n/9 and an upper bound of 41n/16. We then extend the result for the three-stage Clos network to the multistage Clos network. Finally, we propose the weighted version of the edge-coloring problem, which somehow has escaped the literature, associated with our switching network problem.	clos network;graph coloring;input/output;multistage interconnection networks;network switch	Dingzhu Du;Biao Gao;Frank K.

Algorithms for the first three involve the familiar procedures of jeu de taquin, row insertion, and column insertion. The fourth operation, hopscotch, is new, although specialised versions have appeared previously. Like the other three operations, this new operation may be computed with a set of local rules in a growth diagram, and it preserves Knuth equivalence class. Each of these four operations gives rise to an a priori distinct theory of dual equivalence. We show that these four theories coincide. The four operations are linked via the involutive tableau operations of complementation and conjugation.	algorithm;diagram;hopscotch (programming language);jeu de taquin;long division;quaternions and spatial rotation;theory;turing completeness	Tom Roby;Frank Sottile;Jeffrey Stroomer;Julian West	2001	J.

c7c6641ff7c0455f827c41438611206853747cad	a perfect one-factorization ofk36		In this paper, a perfect one-factorization of K36 is given, which is factor-l-rotational. We consider a 1-factorization of K2n, the complete graph with 2n vertices. An automorphism of a 1-factorization is a permutation of vertices which maps 1-factors onto 1-factors. A 1-factorization F is called factor-1-rotational if F has an automorphism fixing two vertices (and one 1-factor), and permuting the remaining 2n 2 vertices (and 2n 2 1-factors) in a single cycle. It has a convenient geometric representation. One takes the vertices of the regular polygon with 2n 2 vertices and labels them with elements of Z2,-2; the other two vertices are labeled with 0% and 002, where Z2,-2 denotes the residue class group modulo 2n 2. Let F 1 be a starter 1-factor of a factor-l-rotational 1-factorization F. The 2n 2 1-factors are obtained by rotating the figure successively through an angle 2n/(2n 2). F consists of these 2n 2 1-factors and the fixed 1-factor F*: F* = { { i , j } ] i j n 1 (mod2n 2)} U {{oc 1,oo2} }. A 1-factorization F is called perfect if the union of every pair of distinct 1-factors is a Hamiltonian circuit. It is known there exist perfect 1-factorizations of K2, when 2n = p + 1, 2p (p is prime), and 2n -16, 28, 50, 244, 344 [1,2]. They were the only known examples of perfect 1-factorizations. Recently Seah and Stinson have discovered a perfect 1-factqrization of K36, which is factor-cyclic [3]. We discovered a perfect 1-factorization of K36 , which is factor-l-rotational. An exhaustive search was made by three computers in parallel, until the first perfect 1-factorization was found. The search was stopped at the first success because a complete exhaustive search is intractable, in our estimation, even ifa super computer were used. A starter 1-factor of a factor-l-rotational, perfect 1-factorization of Ka6 is {{ oe 1, 0}, {oo2, 11 }, {1,2}, {3, 5}, {4, 24}, {6, 9}, {7, 22}, {8, 18}, {10, 17}, {12, 25}, {13, 21}, {14, 23}, {15, 31}, {16, 28}, {19, 30}, {20, 26}, {27, 32}, {29, 33} }. 244 M.

9f458ea1da98f3d5ca56941e9c6cd9b5ad42ee9b	on the geometry of border rank algorithms for matrix multiplication and other tensors with symmetry		We establish basic information about border rank algorithms for the matrix multiplication tensor and other tensors with symmetry. We prove that border rank algorithms for tensors with symmetry (such as matrix multiplication and the determinant polynomial) come in families that include representatives with normal forms. These normal forms will be useful both to develop new efficient algorithms and to prove lower complexity bounds. We derive a border rank version of the substitution method used in proving lower bounds for tensor rank. We use this border-substitution method and a normal form to improve the lower bound on the border rank of matrix multiplication by one, to 2n − n + 1. We also point out difficulties that will be formidable obstacles to future progress on lower complexity bounds for tensors because of the “wild” structure of the Hilbert scheme of points.	a-normal form;database normalization;matrix multiplication algorithm;polynomial;substitution method;the matrix	J.

Comparing with the existing recursive DFT/IDFT architectures, the proposed recursive architecture achieves a reduction in computation-cycle by half. Appling this novel low-computation cycle architecture, we could double the throughput rate and the channel density without increasing the operating frequency for the dual tone multi-frequency (DTMF) detector in the high channel density voice over packet (VoP) application. From the chip implementation results, the proposed architecture is capable of processing over 128 channels and each channel consumes 9.77 μW under 1.2 V@20 MHz in TSMC 0.13 1P8M CMOS process. The proposed VLSI implementation shows the power-efficient advantage by the low-computation cycle architecture. key words: channel density, high density voice over packet, high throughput, low-computation cycle, power efficiency, recursive DFT/IDFT	cmos;chebyshev polynomials;clock rate;computation;discrete fourier transform;dual-tone multi-frequency signaling;network packet;performance per watt;polynomial;recursion (computer science);strength reduction;throughput;very-large-scale integration	Lan-Da Van;Chin-Teng Lin;Yuan-Chu Yu	2007	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietfec/e90-a.8.1644	high-throughput screening;real-time computing;electrical efficiency;telecommunications	Arch	31.6979623485733	55.517780943747454	61311

cac3d75d31c383df6927b2ad6a763a4810b8c20f	fast propagation of hamming and signal distances for register-transfer level datapaths		Hamming and signal distance are common model variables for characterising register-transfer level components for power. In order to use power estimation models based on this characterisation it is nec- essary to know exact input-stimuli for a circuit in order to propagate it through the datapath and calculate the Hamming and signal distances at each node. In this work a new propagation approach for Hamming and signal distances is presented. It is based on precharacterised components for Hamming and signal distances. Using this approach it is not necessary to know the exact input data of a circuit, only statistical information of the input-stream is needed. The errors of the estimated Hamming and signal distance properties are in the range of 5 % to 14 % The result of an estimation is available nearly instantaneously since look-up tables are used for implementation.	register-transfer level;software propagation;window function	Axel Reimer;Lars Kosmann;Daniel Lorenz;Wolfgang Nebel	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-36157-9_7	hamming weight;electronic engineering;hamming distance;hamming bound;theoretical computer science;hamming code;hamming(7,4)	ML	27.659633098970815	45.38531429138226	61509

The code can be generalized to correct the loss or gain of a burst of bits. A further feature is the possibility of correcting additive errors appearing in the vicinity of the bit loss or gain. An additive error is a bit changed from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0. The code is constructed by inserting a known character into a burst-error-correcting code at periodic intervals. The known character locates the approximate position of the bit loss or gain. At the location a bit is inserted or removed from the block, depending on whether a loss or a gain has occurred. The error-correcting code then corrects the erroneous bits between where the error occurred and where the correction took place.	approximation algorithm;block code;burst transmission;forward error correction;utility functions on indivisible goods	Frederick F.

f6c8be9f15862d604276d8432d6b2d54cacf185a	use of data recharging for personal information environment		An embedded framing bit pattern in a serial bit stream is located by combining the last bit to arrive of the serial bit stream with a predetermined number of prior bits of the serial bit stream which are spaced apart by the pitch of the bits of the framing bit pattern, and this combination of bits is tested to determine if the combination matches part of the framing bit pattern. If a match does not occur, then the bits which were combined together are changed to a bit pattern that will not result in a match when these bits (except for the eldest bit which is disregarded) is combined again with a new bit of the serial bit stream, no matter what the logic state of the new bit. In this manner all of the bits, as they arrive and are combined and tested, will eventually be changed except the bits which are part of the framing bit pattern.

Knowing these generators makes it possible to use Gröbner basis methods for carrying out certain basic operations in the ring of such sequences effectively. In particular, one can answer the question whether a given sequence can be represented in terms of other given sequences.

Bondy and Erdős conjectured that for an odd cycle on n vertices Cn, R(Cn, Cn, Cn) = 4n − 3 for n > 3. This is sharp if true. Luczak proved that if n is odd, then R(Cn, Cn, Cn) = 4n+o(n), as n → ∞. We prove here the exact Bondy-Erdős conjecture for sufficiently large values of n. We also describe the Ramsey-extremal colorings and prove some related stability theorems.

72c60d5cdafe206773d766f9bd5e79af025f6cd5	inclusion matrices and the mds conjecture	linear codes;mds conjecture;singleton bound	Let Fq be a finite field of order q with characteristic p. An arc in F k q is an ordered family of at least k vectors in which every subfamily of size k is a basis of Fq . The MDS conjecture, which was posed by Segre in 1955, states that if k 6 q, then an arc in Fq has size at most q + 1, unless q is even and k = 3 or k = q − 1, in which case it has size at most q + 2. We propose a conjecture which would imply that the MDS conjecture is true for almost all values of k when q is odd. We prove our conjecture in two cases and thus give simpler proofs of the MDS conjecture when k 6 p, and if q is not prime, for k 6 2p − 2. To accomplish this, given an arc G ⊂ Fq and a nonnegative integer n, we construct a matrix M ↑n G , which is related to an inclusion matrix, a well-studied object in combinatorics. Our main results relate algebraic properties of the matrix M ↑n G to properties of the arc G and may provide new tools in the computational classification of large arcs.	erdős–faber–lovász conjecture;linear algebra;the matrix	Ameera Chowdhury	2016	Electr.

The revived interest in this algorithm has highlighted the need for better estimations of upper bounds of positive roots. In this paper we present a new theorem, based on a generalization of a theorem by D. Stefanescu, and describe several implementations of it – including Cauchy's and Kioustelidis' rules as well as two new rules recently developed by us. From the empirical results presented here we see that applying various implementations of our theorem – and taking the minimum of the computed values – greatly improves the estimation of the upper bound and hopefully that will affect the performance of the continued fractions real root isolation method.	algorithm;coefficient;newton's method;polynomial;roots	Alkiviadis G.

aa2b5161d18734a4aec238037ed5b485fbeb7f1b	revisiting the expansion length of triple-base number system for elliptic curve scalar multiplication		Because of its sparsity, triple-base number system is used to accelerate the scalar multiplication in elliptic curve cryptography. Yu et al. presented an estimate for the length of triple-base number system at Africacrypt 2013. However, the efficiency of scalar multiplication is not only associated with the length of representation but also the numbers and costs of doubling, tripling, quintupling and addition. It is necessary to set a restriction for exponents of base 2, 3 and 5, which will lead to longer expansion length. In this situation, we prove a stronger result: the upper bound on expansion length of constrained triple-base number system is still sub-linear. This result provides more practical boundary of the triple-base number system to speed up the scalar multiplication. At the same time, it also generalizes the result of Méloni et al. about double-base number system.	binary number;elliptic curve cryptography;period-doubling bifurcation;scalar processor;sparse matrix	Yunqi Dou;Jiang Weng;Chuangui Ma;Fushan Wei	2018	J.

2e2f7b76c3950dfe285b47e5a8103d5115e1a38c	studying the structure of some networks using certain topological indices		Analyzing the structural properties of graphs, networks and particularly complex networks is a research topic with ongoing interest. One of the approaches in studying structural properties is finding quantitative measures that encode structural information of the entire network by a real number. Recently, a number of graph invariants, also known as topological indices, have been used as measures to analyze the whole structure of networks. In this paper, we study a class of large networks named Equilateral Tetra Sheet network (ETTS_n) and Hex derived network (HDN_n). We give the construction method for these networks and extract its structural properties. Then, we employ a computational technique called edge-cut method to obtain new analytical expressions for certain topological indices, such as, the Wiener index (W) and the generalized Terminal Wiener index ((TW_K ; with ; K={delta , varDelta })). After that, we compare the efficiency of the computed indices by using graphical representations. At the end, we summarize our findings.	topological index	Meryam Zeryouh;Mohamed El Marraki;Mohamed Essalih	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-72150-7_44	encode;equilateral triangle;graph property;complex network;wiener index;real number;topology;invariant (mathematics);expression (mathematics);mathematics	Theory	28.90916786347173	36.438209658229106	62981

In this paper, we consider this question for the class of all relatively free groups having only cyclic centralizers of non-trivial elements. We prove that each automorphism of the endomorphism semigroup End(F) of groups F from this class is uniquely determined by its action on the subgroup of inner automorphisms Inn(F). The obtained general result includes the following cases: absolutely free groups, free Burnside groups of odd period n ≥ 665, free groups of infinitely based varieties of Adian (the cardinality of the set of such varieties is continuum), and so on.

This paper suggests a system level architecture to make a hardware evaluation board for the IEEE 802.11ad PHY.

Then, we have proposed the appropriate hardware architecture, external connection method that contains the bit-width of interface and clock. We could have shown a 3-board solution for the system including MAC and ADC/DAC and RF. Especially, we have compared 2 methods connecting the ADC/DAC.

Known bilinear dual hyperovals in V ((d + 1)(d + 2)/2, 2) are the Huybrechts dual hyperoval and the Buratti–Del Fra dual hyperoval. In this paper, we investigate on the covering map π : S c(l ′,GF(2r ′ )) → Sc(l,GF(2 )), where the dual hyperovals S c(l ′,GF(2r ′ )) and Sc(l,GF(2 )) are constructed in Taniguchi (2014). Using the result, we show that the Buratti–Del Fra dual hyperoval has a bilinear quotient in V (2d + 1, 2) if d is odd. On the other hand, we show that the Huybrechts dual hyperoval has no bilinear quotient in V (2d + 1, 2). We also determine the automorphism group of Sc(l,GF(2 )), and show that Aut(Sc(l2,GF(21 ))) < Aut(Sc(l,GF(2 ))). © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

788aeea77ec80eca04be13f6f7eaf260507d1c53	a pseudo random bit generator based on chaotic logistic map and its statistical testing	statistical test;logistic map	During last one and half decade an interesting relationship between chaos and cryptography has been developed, according to which many properties of chaotic systems such as: ergodicity, sensitivity to initial conditions/system parameters, mixing property, deterministic dynamics and structural complexity can be considered analogous to the confusion, diffusion with small change in plaintext/secret key, diffusion with a small change within one block of the plaintext, deterministic pseudo randomness and algorithmic complexity properties of traditional cryptosystems. As a result of this close relationship several chaos-based cryptosystems have been put forward since 1990. In one of the stages of the development of chaotic stream ciphers, the application of discrete chaotic dynamical systems in pseudo random bit generation has been widely studied recently. In this communication, we propose a novel pseudo random bit generator (PRBG) based on two chaotic logistic maps running side-by-side and starting from random independent initial conditions. The pseudo random bit sequence is generated by comparing the outputs of both the chaotic logistic maps. We discuss the suitability of the logistic map by highlighting some of its interesting statistical properties, which make it a perfect choice for such random bit generation. Finally, we present the detailed results of the statistical testing on generated bit sequences, done by the most stringent tests of randomness: the NIST suite tests, to detect the specific characteristics expected of truly random sequences.	chaos theory;computational complexity theory;cryptography;cryptosystem;dynamical system;ergodicity;initial condition;iteration;key (cryptography);logistic map;plaintext;pseudorandomness;randomness tests;stream cipher;structural complexity (applied mathematics)	Vinod Patidar;Krishan K.

658947b9cfdd8b0bc5533bd361228ac75e5bf5e2	a new chase-type soft-decision decoding algorithm for reed-solomon codes		This paper addresses three relevant issues arising in desig ning Chase-type algorithms for ReedSolomon codes: 1) how to choose the set of testing patterns; 2 ) given the set of testing patterns, what is the optimal testing order in the sense that the most-likel y codeword is expected to appear earlier; and 3) how to identify the most-likely codeword. A new Chasetype soft-decision decoding algorithm is proposed, referred to as tree-based Chase-type algorithm . The proposed tree-based Chase-type algorithm takes the set of all vectors as the set of testing patterns, an d he ce definitely delivers the most-likely codeword provided that the computational resources are all owed. All the testing patterns are arranged in an ordered rooted tree according to the likelihood bounds of the possibly generated codewords. While performing the algorithm, the ordered rooted tree is constr ucted progressively by adding at most two leafs at each trial. The ordered tree naturally induces a suf ficient condition for the most-likely codeword. That is, whenever the tree-based Chase-type algorithm exit s before a preset maximum number of trials is reached, the output codeword must be the most-likely one. Wh en t e tree-based Chase-type algorithm is combined with Guruswami-Sudan (GS) algorithm, each tria l can be implement in an extremely simple way by removing from the gradually updated Gröbner b asis one old point and interpolating one new point. Simulation results show that the tree-based Chas e-type algorithm performs better than the recently proposed Chase-type algorithm by Bellorado et al w ith less trials (on average) given that the maximum number of trials is the same. Also proposed are simul ation-based performance bounds on the maximum-likelihood decoding (MLD) algorithm, which are ut ilized to illustrate the near-optimality of the tree-based Chase-type algorithm in the high signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) region. In addition, the treebased Chase-type algorithm admits decoding with a likeliho od threshold, that searches the most-likely codeword within an Euclidean sphere rather than a Hamming sp here.

Group divisible codes played an important role in their constructions. In this paper, we study the problem of constructing optimal ternary constant-composition codes with Hamming weight four and minimum distance six.

The complexity of the algorithm isO(n) field operations if we know the factorization of the characteristic polynomial (or O(n ln(n)) operations for a matrix of integers of fixed size).

Splines play a key role in approximation theory, geometric modeling, and numerical analysis; their properties depend on combinatorics, topology, and geometry of a simplicial or polyhedral subdivision of a region in Rk, and are often quite subtle. We describe four algebraic techniques which are useful in the study of splines: homology, graded algebra, localization, and inverse systems. Our goal is to give a hands-on introduction to the methods, and illustrate them with concrete examples in the context of splines. We highlight progress made with these methods, such as a formula for the third coefficient of the polynomial giving the dimension of the spline space in high degree. A tutorial on computational aspects using the Macaulay2 software system appears elsewhere in this issue.	approximation theory;coefficient;geometric modeling;hands-on computing;homology (biology);linear algebra;macaulay2;numerical analysis;polyhedron;polynomial;software system;spline (mathematics);subdivision surface	Hal Schenck	2016	Computer Aided Geometric Design	10.1016/j.cagd.2015.11.001	spline;inverse system;homology;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;internationalization and localization;mathematics;geometry;thin plate spline;box spline;algebra	Theory	50.64783645997562	35.30444515922909	63723

The algorithm presented here has approximately the same number of average iterations and maximum number of iterations. It is shown, when P is a Mersenne prime, implementation of this algorithm on a processor, designed especially for mod P arithmetic operations, produces a more efficient algorithm with respect to the amount of program statements and number of operations. It is then shown heuristically, when the division and multiplications are performed simultaneously, the Euclidean algorithm has fewer subiterations.	extended euclidean algorithm;heuristic;iteration	J.

We characterize the class of generalized bent functions symmetric with respect to two variables, provide analogues of Maiorana–McFarland type bent functions and Dillon’s functions in the generalized set up. A class of bent functions called generalized spreads is introduced and we show that it contains all Dillon type generalized bent functions and Maiorana–McFarland type generalized bent functions. Thus, unification of two different types of generalized bent functions is achieved. The crosscorrelation spectrum of generalized Dillon type bent functions is also characterized. We further characterize generalized bent Boolean functions defined on Z2 with values in Z4 and Z8. Moreover, we propose several constructions of such generalized bent functions for both n even and n odd.	bent function;boolean algebra;cross-correlation;dillon's rolling western;unification (computer science);z4 (computer);zilog z8	Pantelimon Stanica;Thor Martinsen;Sugata Gangopadhyay;Brajesh Kumar Singh	2013	Des.

The set of such positive polynomials forms a closed convex cone K. In this paper, we consider the likelihood ratio test for the hypothesis of positivity that the estimand polynomial regression curve is a positive polynomial. By considering hierarchical hypotheses including the hypothesis of positivity, we define nested likelihood ratio tests, and derive their null distributions as mixtures of chi-square distributions by using the volume-of-tubes method. The mixing probabilities are obtained by utilizing the parameterizations for the cone K and its dual provided in the framework of Tchebycheff systems for polynomials of degree at most 4. For polynomials of degree greater than 4, the upper and lower bounds for the null distributions are provided. Moreover, we propose associated simultaneous confidence bounds for polynomial regression curves. Regarding computation, we demonstrate that symmetric cone programming is useful to obtain the test statistics. As an illustrative example, we conduct data analysis on growth curves of two groups. We examine the hypothesis that the growth rate (the derivative of growth curve) of one group is always higher than the other.	polynomial	Naohiro Kato;Satoshi Kuriki	2013	J.

Numer. 72 (1990) 101; Discrete Math. 124 (1994) 99). Let  N ( Z ) denote the set of all positive integers(integers). The (integral) sum graph of a finite subset  S ⊂ N ( Z ) is the graph ( S , E ) with two vertices that are adjacent whenever their sum is in S. A graph G is said to be a (integral) sum graph if it is isomorphic to the (integral) sum graph of some  S ⊂ Z . The (integral) sum number of a given graph G, denoted by  σ ( G )( ζ ( G )), was defined as the smallest number of isolated vertices which when added to G resulted in a (integral) sum graph.  In this paper, the integral sum number and the graph ( K   n  − E ( K   r  )), which is an unsolved problem proposed by Harary (1994) in 1994, are investigated and determined. The results on the integral sum number of graph ( K   n  − E ( K   r  )) are presented as follows:   ζ(K     n   −E(K     r   ))=  0  (r=n,n−1),  n−2  (r=n−2),  n−1  (n−3⩾r⩾⌈  2n  3  ⌉−1),  3n−2r−4  (⌈  2n  3  ⌉−1>r⩾  n  2  ),  2n−4  (⌈  2n  3  ⌉−1⩾  n  2  >r⩾2),   where  n ⩾5, r ⩾2. Furthermore, if  r ≠ n −1, then  σ ( K   n  − E ( K   r  ))= ζ ( K   n  − E ( K   r  )).

Then, the well known Helly and Radon theorems on ordinary convex sets hold for all such convexities with order η and 2η respectively, where η is the Hadwiger number of the graph (or the chromatic number of the surface):  G  is contractible into  K η  , but not into  K  η + 1 .

The sync pattern of length N starts being emitted at a random time within some interval of size A, where A characterizes the asynchronism level. We show that a sequential decoder can optimally locate the sync pattern, i.e., exactly, without delay, and with probability approaching one as N rarr infin, if the asynchronism level grows as O(eNalpha), with alpha below the synchronization threshold, a constant that admits a simple expression depending on the channel. If alpha exceeds the synchronization threshold, any decoder, sequential or nonsequential, locates the sync pattern with an error that tends to one as Nrarr infin. Hence, a sequential decoder can locate a sync pattern as well as the (nonsequential) maximum-likelihood decoder that operates on the basis of output sequences of maximum length A+N-1, but with far fewer observations.	decoding methods;monomial;sequential decoding;the sync	Venkat Chandar;Aslan Tchamkerten;Gregory W.

It greatly increases the complexity of configuration research in that the possible configuration number of the reconfigurable modular robot grows exponentially with the increase of module number. Being the initial configuration or the basic configuration of the reconfigurable robot, the center-configuration plays a crucial role in system’s actual applications. In this paper, a novel center-configuration selection technique has been proposed for reconfigurable modular robots. Based on the similarities between configurations’ transformation and graph theory, configuration network has been applied in the modeling and analyzing of these configurations. Configuration adjacency matrix, reconfirmation cost matrix, and center-configuration coefficient have been defined for the configuration network correspondingly. Being similar to the center-location problem, the center configuration has been selected according to the largest center-configuration coefficient. As an example of the reconfigurable robotic system, AMOEBA-I, a three-module reconfigurable robot with nine configurations which was developed in Shenyang Institute of Automation (SIA), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), has been introduced briefly. According to the numerical simulation result, the center-configuration coefficients for these nine configurations have been calculated and compared to validate this technique.

Definitions and Background A balanced incomplete block design, BIBD(v, b, 1', k, A), is an arrangement of v elements into b blocks such that (i) each element appears in exactly r blocks; (ii) each block contains exactly k elements; and (iii) each pair of distinct elem,ents appear together in A blocks. Well known necessary conditions for a BlBD(v, b, r, k, A) to exist are vr bk and A( vI) = r( k 1). Because of this dependence we shall use the abbreviated notation BIBD(v,k,A) to denote a BIBD(v,b,r,k,A). A BIBD is nontrivial if :3 k < v. A symmetric BIBD (SBIBD) is a BIBD with v b. A projective plane of order v is an SBIBD( v 2 + v + 1, v + 1, 1). Two BIBD( v, k, A)'S, with element sets VI and 112 respectively, are said to be isomorphic if there is a bijection () : VI --t 112 which preserves blocks. An automorphism of a BlBD is an isomorphism of the BIBD with itself. The set of all automorphisms, under the usual composition of mappings, forms the a71tom07'phism group of the BlBD.

Cayley graphs on ZnZn with respect to SS are called circulant graphs and denoted by Cay(Zn,S)Cay(Zn,S). In this paper, for connected non-complete circulant graphs Cay(Zn,S)Cay(Zn,S) of degree |S|=p−1|S|=p−1 with pp prime, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of efficient dominating sets, and characterize all efficient dominating sets if exist.

In the special case of K = {k} one speaks of constant dimension codes. Since this emerging field is very prosperous on the one hand side and there are a lot of connections to classical objects from Galois geometry it is a bit difficult to keep or to obtain an overview about the current state of knowledge.

The algorithm is based on multivariate polynomial interpolation and root-finding over extension fields. It was noted by Vadhan that interpolating a linear polynomial suffices if one settles for a smaller decoding radius (but still enough for a statement of the above form). Here we give a simple linear-algebra based analysis of this variant that eliminates the need for the computationally expensive rootfinding step over extension fields (and indeed any mention of extension fields). The entire list decoding algorithm is linearalgebraic, solving one linear system for the interpolation step, and another linear system to find a small subspace of candidate solutions. Except for the step of pruning this subspace, the algorithm can be implemented to run in quadratic time. The theoretical drawback of folded RS codes are that both the decoding complexity and proven worst-case list-size bound are n (1="""").

In this paper, we explore properties of standard set-valued Young tableaux with three rows and a fixed number of integers in every cell of each row. Our primary focus is on standard set-valued Young tableaux with 1 integer in each first-row cell, k−1 integers in each second-row cell, and 1 integer in each third-row cell.

An [n, k, d] linear code having all-symbol (r, δ)-locality, denoted as (r, δ)<sub>a</sub>, is considered optimal if it has the actual highest minimum distance of any code of the given parameters n, k, r and δ. A minimum distance bound is given in [10]. The existing results on the existence and the construction of optimal (r, δ)<sub>a</sub> linear codes are limited to only two small regions within this special case, namely, i) m = 0 and ii) m ≥ (v+δ-1) > (δ-1) and δ = 2, where m = n mod (r+δ-1) and v = k mod r. This paper investigates the properties and existence conditions for optimal (r, δ)<sub>a</sub> linear codes with general r and δ. First, a structure theorem is derived for general optimal (r, δ)<sub>a</sub> codes which helps illuminate some of their structure properties. Next, the entire problem space with arbitrary n, k, r and δ is divided into eight different cases (regions) with regard to the specific relations of these parameters. For two cases, it is rigorously proved that no (r, δ)<sub>a</sub> linear code can achieve the minimum distance bound in [10]. For four other cases the optimal (r, δ)<sub>a</sub> codes are shown to exist over a field of size q ≥ (<sub>k-1</sub><sup>n</sup>), deterministic constructions are proposed. Our new constructive algorithms not only cover more cases, but for the same cases where previous algorithms exist, the new constructions require a smaller field, which translates to potentially lower computational complexity. Our findings substantially enriches the knowledge on optimal (r, δ)<sub>a</sub> linear codes, leaving only two cases in which the construction of optimal codes are not yet known.	code (cryptography);computational complexity theory;computer data storage;deterministic algorithm;erasure code;linear code;optimal control;problem domain	Wentu Song;Son Hoang Dau;Chau Yuen;Tiffany Jing Li	2014	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2014.140521	block code;erasure code;discrete mathematics;distributed data store;computer science;theoretical computer science;linear code;expander code;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	35.95080336700194	58.301759296497714	65148

The change of ordering algorithm is crucial for these strategies. We study the p-adic stability of the main change of ordering algorithm, FGLM. We show that FGLM is stable and give explicit upper bound on the loss of precision occuring in its execution. The variant of FGLM designed to pass from the grevlex ordering to a Gröbner basis in shape position is also stable.

The modules are given via vertex projective presentations over path algebras and finite dimensional quotients of path algebras. We use the theory of right Gröbner bases to encode modules and to construct appropriate systems of equations for computing homomorphism spaces and endomorphism rings. The algorithm is implemented in the computer algebra system GAP and is included in Hopf, a computational package for noncommutative algebra. The performance of our implementation for computing endomorphism rings is experimentally compared with the implementation in Magma for the same class of modules.

The coding scheme is based on the uniqueness of the primary decomposition of ideals in Noetherian rings. The source alphabet consists of a set of radical ideals constructed from a chosen subset of the prime spectrum of the ring. The distance function between two radical ideals is taken to be the Hamming metric based on the symmetric distance between sets. As an application we construct codes for random networks employing SAF routing.	algorithm;chaitin's constant;code;code word;computer algebra system;error detection and correction;flow network;hamming distance;johnson bound;linear network coding;nonlinear system;routing;store and forward	Anirban Ghatak	2011	2011 3rd International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)		block code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;hamming distance;topology;telecommunications;computer science;hamming graph;linear code;hamming code;mathematics;forward error correction;hamming(7,4);statistics;coding theory	Theory	39.999910819856474	54.22304814953804	65516
7594d57b35516252910ae17705e8c6387b75f549	on erasure combinatorial batch codes		Combinatorial batch codes were defined by Paterson, Stinson, and Wei as purely combinatorial versions of the batch codes introduced by Ishai, Kushilevitz, Ostrovsky, and Sahai. There are n items and m servers, each of which stores a subset of the items. A batch code is an arrangement for storing items on servers so that, for prescribed integers k and t, any k items can be retrieved by reading at most t items from each server. Silberstein defined an erasure batch code (with redundancy r) as a batch code in which any k items can be retrieved by reading at most t items from each server, while any r servers are unavailable (failed). In this paper, we investigate erasure batch codes with t = 1 (each server can read at most one item) in a combinatorial manner. We determine the optimal (minimum) total storage of an erasure batch code for several ranges of parameters. Additionally, we relate optimal erasure batch codes to maximum packings. We also identify a necessary lower bound for the total storage of an erasure batch code, and we relate parameters for which this trivial lower bound is achieved to the existence of graphs with appropriate girth.

f40793f8373447c773b9083f0b00212b8b26af82	a note on a series of families constructed over the cyclic graph		Abstract Paul Erdős and Laszlo Lovasz established by means of an example that there exists a maximal intersecting family of k -sets with ⌊ ( e − 1 ) k ! ⌋ blocks, where e is the base of natural logarithm. Laszlo Lovasz conjectured that their example is best known example which has the maximum number of blocks. Later it was disproved. But the quest for such examples remain valid till this date. In this note we compute the transversal size of a certain series of intersecting families of k -sets, which is constructed over the Cyclic graph. It helps to provide an example of maximal intersecting family of k -sets with so many blocks and to present two worthwhile examples which disprove two special cases of one of the conjectures of Frankl et al.

The author gave an algorithm in [7, 8] to compute the normalizers of permutation groups and particularly it worked smoothly for transitive groups of degree up to 22. In 1999 GAP version 4 was released. Since then the GAP system has been improved and in 2004 GAP4r4 had a special function to compute the normalizers in the symmetric groups but it still has difficulties in computing the normalizers of some permutation groups. It has been also found that the author's algorithm in [7, 8] has difficulties in some groups of small degree but larger than 22. So the author will give two new programs improving the computation of normalizers of transitive permutation groups in the symmetric groups. One of them works comparatively smoothly for the transitive groups of degree up to 30.	algorithm;computation;smoothing;transitive dependency	Izumi Miyamoto	2006		10.1145/1145768.1145808	composition;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;permutation graph;resultant;mathematics;permutation group;bit-reversal permutation;base;symmetric group;cyclic permutation;special functions;algebra	Theory	40.64570015891091	38.745345126812246	65775

Examples exist for i = 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. In this paper we exhibit the first known type (7, 1) pair. The natural numbers M and N are amicable if σ(M) = σ(N) = M +N , where σ(M) represents the sum of the positive divisors of M . An amicable pair is of type (i, 1) if M = E ·p1 · p2 . . . pi and N = E · q, where E is the greatest common factor of M and N , and q and each pj are different primes not dividing E for j = 1, 2, . . . i. Type (i, 1) amicable pairs have been the object of special investigation and search [1], [2], [3], [5]. Often it is possible to construct other amicable pairs from them [6]. Also, until Euler’s time [4], the only three known amicable pairs were of type (2,1). One of these is the smallest existing amicable pair (2 · 5 · 11, 2 · 71), which was known to the Pythagoreans. There are special web pages that contain information about (i, 1) amicable numbers. Interested readers are referred to the collection of these pairs in the Internet [7]. The first (3,1) amicable pair was discovered by Poulet in 1941, the first (4,1) pair by Lee in 1966, the first (5,1) pair by te Riele in 1982 and the first (6,1) pair by Pedersen in 1997. As of the writing of this article (March, 2001), there are 478 known amicable pairs of type (2,1), 655 pairs of type (3,1), 248 pairs of type (4,1), 58 pairs of type (5,1), and 7 pairs of type (6,1). There are also 50 known amicable pairs of the so called exotic or irregular [7] type, which are closely related to (i, 1) pairs as defined above. The author has just found the first known type (7,1) amicable pair, which follows: M = 2 · 5 · 19 · p1 · p2 · p3 · p4 · p5 · p6 · p7, N = 2 · 5 · 19 · q, where p1 = 23, p2 = 2203, p3 = 256661, p4 = 20053673, p5 = 872652329, p6 = 227581730937820119934248943, p7 = 2177018379078405763792563767026726112056503960079, Received by the editor May 21, 2001. 2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

A scalar linear index code to a given IC problem is a matrix representing the transmitted linear combinations of the message symbols. The length of an index code is then the number of transmissions (or equivalently, the number of rows in the index code). An IC problem <tex>$\mathcal{I}_{ext}$</tex> is called an extension of another IC problem <tex>$\mathcal{I}$</tex> if the fitting matrix of <tex>$\mathcal{I}$</tex> is a submatrix of the fitting matrix of <tex>$\mathcal{I}_{ext}$</tex>. We first present a straightforward m-order extension <tex>$\mathcal{I}_{ext}$</tex> of an IC problem <tex>$\mathcal{I}$</tex> for which an index code is obtained by concatenating <tex>$m$</tex> copies of an index code of <tex>$\mathcal{I}$</tex>. The length of the codes is the same for both <tex>$\mathcal{I}$</tex> and <tex>$\mathcal{I}_{ext}$</tex>, and if the index code for <tex>$\mathcal{I}$</tex> has optimal length then so does the extended code for <tex>$\mathcal{I}_{ext}$</tex>. More generally, an extended IC problem of <tex>$\mathcal{I}$</tex> having the same optimal length as <tex>$\mathcal{I}$</tex> is said to be a rank-invariant extension of <tex>$\mathcal{I}$</tex>, We then focus on 2-order rank-invariant extensions of <tex>$\mathcal{I}$</tex>, and present constructions of such extensions based on involutory permutation matrices.	code;concatenation;server (computing)	Vamsi Krishna Gummadi;Ashok Choudhary;Prasad Krishnan	2018	2018 Twenty Fourth National Conference on Communications (NCC)		mathematics;permutation matrix;discrete mathematics;scalar (physics);coding (social sciences);linear combination;matrix (mathematics);row;invariant (mathematics)	Theory	39.47095679886105	51.60814576966084	65915

This bound is tight upto a factor of log s as the Fourier dimension and sparsity of the address function are quadratically related. We obtain the bound by observing that the Fourier dimension of a Boolean function is equivalent to its non-adaptive parity decision tree complexity, and then bounding the latter.	decision tree model;sparse matrix	Swagato Sanyal	2015		10.1007/978-3-662-47672-7_84	fourier transform;sine and cosine transforms;discrete-time fourier transform;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;topology;short-time fourier transform;discrete fourier transform;harmonic analysis;fourier inversion theorem;discrete fourier series;mathematics;fourier analysis;phase correlation;fourier series	Theory	48.67840299290305	38.39387456094251	65967

The naive interpolation algorithm needs de + 1 queries, where d = max{deg f, deg g} and thus requires de < q . For a prime q = p , we design an algorithm that is asymptotically better in certain cases, especially when d is large. The algorithm is based on a result of independent interest in spirit of additive combinatorics. It gives an upper bound on the number of values of a rational function of large degree, evaluated on a short sequence of consecutive integers, that belong to a small subgroup of F∗ p .	algorithm;arithmetic combinatorics;degree (graph theory);interpolation;monic polynomial;utility functions on indivisible goods	Marek Karpinski;László Mérai;Igor E.

The problem is to find an a, if one exists (in some algebraic extension of the rationals), such that in the representation off(x) in the basis 1,x − α, (x − α)2,..., i.e., $$f(x) = \sum\nolimits_{i = 0^{F_i } }^d {(x - \alpha )^i } $$ at most t of the coefficients fi are non-zero. We derive explicit conditions for the uniqueness and rationality of at-sparse shift forf(x) and provide an efficient algorithm for computing a sparse shift when one exists. We also point out an application of our result to the problem of constructing sparse decompositions of univariate polynomials.	algorithm;coefficient;linear algebra;polynomial;rationality;sparse matrix	Yagati N.

A generalized signal flow graph approach yields a complete statistical description of the search time as well as the probability of correctly terminating the search. The motivation for this study comes from the acquisition of an ultra-wideband (UWB) signal in a dense multipath channel. In this particular problem many resolvable paths tend to cluster at a receiver containing multiple correlators allowing for a hybrid serial/parallel search. This hybrid search, as well as a bound on a sorted hybrid search, is analyzed using the generalized signal flow graph approach. Rapid code and frame acquisition at the receiver is desired and it is shown that a specific nonconsecutive search, the bit reversal search, yields an optimum hybrid search procedure under certain conditions. The acquisition of UWB signals also leads to the concept of a self-similar signal flow graph, in which a new search is initiated upon the completion of the previous one.	bit-reversal permutation;concatenation;multipath propagation;newman's lemma;search problem;self-similarity;signal-flow graph;ultra-wideband	Eric A.

New applications, such as rank modulation for flash memories, have suggested the need to consider error-correcting codes for multi-permutations. In this paper, we study systematic error-correcting codes for multi-permutations in general and for permutations in particular. For a given number of information symbols k, and for any integer t, we present a construction of (k+r,k)systematic t-error-correcting codes, for permutations of length k+r, where the number of redundancy symbols r is relatively small. In particular, for a given t and for sufficiently large k, we obtain r=t+1, while a lower bound on the number of redundancy symbols is shown to be t. The same construction is also applied to obtain related systematic error-correcting codes for any types of multi-permutations.	code;error detection and correction;flash memory;forward error correction;information theory;kendall square research;modulation;social inequality;µtorrent	Sarit Buzaglo;Eitan Yaakobi;Tuvi Etzion;Jehoshua Bruck	2016	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2016.2543739	block code;turbo code;discrete mathematics;online codes;fountain code;theoretical computer science;linear code;mathematics;systematics;redundancy;error floor;algorithm;measurement;modulation	Theory	40.074767967832386	55.49964159970502	66459

A major advantage advantage of hypergraph decomposition is that it applies to any access structure, rather than only structures representable as graphs. As a consequence we obtain secret sharing schemes for several classes of access structures with improved efficiency over previous results. We also obtain an elementary characterization of the ideal access structures among the hyperstars, which is of independent interest.	access structure;cholesky decomposition;secret sharing	Giovanni Di Crescenzo;Clemente Galdi	2009	Discrete Applied Mathematics	10.1016/j.dam.2008.04.001	ideal;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;decomposition method;construction;cryptography;theoretical computer science;shamir's secret sharing;cryptographic protocol;mathematics;homomorphic secret sharing;efficiency;secure multi-party computation;proactive secret sharing;secret sharing;verifiable secret sharing;algorithm	Theory	37.04001817164382	53.652084201730936	66471

A perfect (k, I)-Latin square is an N x N array in which any row or column contains every distinct symbol and the symbol at position (i, j) appears exactly k times in the ith row and I times in the jth column, or vice versa. Existence of such squares and the notion of orthogonality for such squares are studied. Several algorithms for constructing such squares are presented.

2bd789c420d4a016d54d14d9334a662b8947ed3b	deterministic polynomial factoring and association schemes		The problem of finding a nontrivial factor of a polynomial f(x) over a finite field Fq has many known efficient, but randomized, algorithms. The deterministic complexity of this problem is a famous open question even assuming the generalized Riemann hypothesis (GRH). In this work we improve the state of the art by focusing on prime degree polynomials; let n be the degree. If (n − 1) has a ‘large’ r-smooth divisor s, then we find a nontrivial factor of f(x) in deterministic poly(nr, log q) time; assuming GRH and that s = Ω( √ n/2r). Thus, for r = O(1) our algorithm is polynomial time. Further, for r = Ω(log logn) there are infinitely many prime degrees n for which our algorithm is applicable and better than the best known; assuming GRH. Our methods build on the algebraic-combinatorial framework of m-schemes initiated by Ivanyos, Karpinski and Saxena (ISSAC 2009). We show that the m-scheme on n points, implicitly appearing in our factoring algorithm, has an exceptional structure; leading us to the improved time complexity. Our structure theorem proves the existence of small intersection numbers in any association scheme that has many relations, and roughly equal valencies and indistinguishing numbers.	computer science;factorization of polynomials;hausdorff dimension;issac;integer factorization;linear algebra;marek karpinski;pointer (computer programming);polynomial;randomized algorithm;time complexity	Manuel Arora;Gábor Ivanyos;Marek Karpinski;Nitin Saxena	2012	Electronic Colloquium on Computational Complexity (ECCC)		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;geometry;algebra	Theory	37.07008442571921	34.17464323095254	66624

Rate variability is not achieved by puncturing, which can have adverse effects on the minimum distance of the code. Using a variable number of input lines of the encoder, we obtain several different overall rates ranging from 1/2 to 7/8. The most suitable soft-in- soft-out decoding algorithm for these turbo codes is based on the dual reciprocal code, which is very efficient for high rate codes. A particular interleaver design, namely the """"backbone"""" interleaver, guarantees a high hamming weight in codewords with information weight 2 and 3, as well as good minimum distances and fairly low multiplicities for higher information weights. Therefore, these codes have very low error floors."""	algorithm;code word;concatenation;convolutional code;digital video broadcasting;encoder;error floor;forward error correction;hamming weight;heart rate variability;internet backbone;neural coding;puncturing;recursion;revision control system;spatial variability;turbo code;word error rate	Marco Ferrari;Sandro Bellini	2009	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2009.05.050300	block code;concatenated error correction code;turbo equalizer;binary code;turbo code;discrete mathematics;convolutional code;low-density parity-check code;online codes;fountain code;computer science;theoretical computer science;serial concatenated convolutional codes;bcjr algorithm;tornado code;linear code;hamming code;expander code;mathematics;forward error correction;error floor;reed–solomon error correction;algorithm;statistics	HPC	41.354181871904224	59.20671944228558	66625

Using the geometry interpretation we construct the Miller function. Then we present explicit formulae for the addition and doubling steps in Miller’s algorithm to compute Tate pairing on Jacobi quartic curves. Both the addition step and doubling step of our formulae for Tate pairing computation on Jacobi curves are faster than previously proposed ones. Finally, we present efficient formulas for Jacobi quartic curves with twists of degree 4 or 6. For twists of degree 4, both the addition steps and doubling steps in our formulas are faster than the fastest result on Weierstrass curves. For twists of degree 6, the addition steps of our formulae are faster than the fastest result on Weierstrass curves.	algorithm;computation;convex function;fastest;iteration;jacobi method;period-doubling bifurcation;quartic function	Liangze Li;Hongfeng Wu;Fan Zhang	2012	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive	10.1007/978-3-319-27998-5_20	combinatorics;mathematical analysis;jacobi method;quartic plane curve;mathematics;geometry;quartic surface	Crypto	45.68331278306331	40.61583933061384	66772

The HOY wireless test platform provides an alternative and cost-effective test solution to address the poor accessibility and high test cost issues. The key idea is implementing a low-cost and short-distance wireless transceiver on chip so that all test instructions and data can be transmitted without physical access. Due to the limited wireless bandwidth, all modules in the device under test (DUT) are preferred to have some built-in self-test (BIST) features. Prior works successfully demonstrated that DUTs with memory and digital circuits can be tested on the low-cost wireless test platform. However, there is no example to show if it is also possible to test the DUT embedded with analog circuits on the HOY test platform. This paper demonstrates the first system-level integration including hardware and software for testing a fully-integrated BIST ADC on the HOY wireless test platform. The DUT chip fabricated in 0.18-μm CMOS consists of a second-order Σ–Δ ADC under test (AUT) and the BIST circuitry. The AUT design employs the decorrelating design-for-digital-testability (D3T) scheme to make itself digitally testable. The BIST design is based on the modified controlled sine wave fitting (CSWF) method. The required BIST circuits are purely digital and as small as 9.9k gates. The gate count of the HOY test wrapper is less than 1k. Experimental results obtained by the HOY wireless test platform show that the AUT achieves a dynamic range of 85.1 dB and a peak SNDR of 78.6 dB. The wireless test results show good agreement with those acquired by conventional analog tests.	built-in self-test	Shao-Feng Hung;Hao-Chiao Hong	2012	J.

This class of codes, have a matrix defined by the n-fold iterated Kronecker product Gn = F⊗n of a binary upper-triangular kernel matrix F, where some columns are suppressed given a specific puncturing pattern. Polar and Reed- Muller codes are well known examples of such KPB codes. The triangular structure of Gn enables to perform ML decoding as a binary tree search for the closest codeword to the received point. We take advantage of the highly regular fractal structure of Gn and the “tree folding” technique to design an efficient ML decoder, enabling to decode relatively longer block lengths than with a standard binary tree search. The tree κ-folding operation transforms the binary tree with N levels into a non-binary tree with N=2κ levels, where the search can be significantly accelerated by a suitable ordering of the branch metrics. For a given κ we can find (n over κ) different folding which lead to decoders with different complexity, for a given code. Using the proposed folded tree decoder, we provide exact ML performances of some Reed-Muller and polar codes over a binary AWGN channel for the block length up to 256.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;binary decoder;binary tree;block code;box–muller transform;code word;column (database);decoding methods;fractal;iteration;performance;polar code (coding theory);puncturing;reed–muller code;reed–solomon error correction;requirement;triangular matrix	Sinan Kahraman;Emanuele Viterbo;Mehmet Ertugrul Çelebi	2013	2013 51st Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)	10.1109/Allerton.2013.6736584	random binary tree;block code;reed–muller code;list decoding;concatenated error correction code;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;binary expression tree;sequential decoding;theoretical computer science;self-balancing binary search tree;linear code;mathematics;error floor	HPC	42.09714901350779	59.987907413421304	67256

However, virtually none of the numerical analysis literature directly applies to geometric calculations. Even for line intersection, the most basic geometric operation, there is no robust and efficient algorithm. Compounding the difficulties, many geometric algorithms perform iterations of calculations reusing previously computed data. In this paper, we explore some of the main issues in geometric computations and the methods that have been proposed to handle roundoff errors. In particular, we focus on one method and apply it to a general iterative intersection problem. Our initial results seem promising and will hopefully lead to robust solutions for more complex problems of computational geometry.	algorithm;computation;computational geometry;iteration;line–line intersection;numerical analysis;round-off error	David P.

The research of symbol-pair code s with large minimum pair-distance is interesting since such code s have the best possible error-correcting capability. A sym bol-pair code attaining maximal minimum pair-distance is called a maximu m distance separable (MDS) symbol-pair code. In this paper, w give a new construction of q-ary MDS symbol-pair codes with pair-distance 5 and length from5 to q + q+1, which completely solves the cased = 5. For pair-distance6 and length from6 to q + 1, we construct MDS(n, 6)q symbol-pair codes by using a configuration called ovoid in projective geometry.

I NTRODUCTION With the development of high-density data storage technolo gies, while the codes are defined as usual over some discrete symbol alphabet, their reading from the channel is performe d as overlapping pairs of symbols. A channel whose outputs ar e overlapping pairs of symbols is called a symbol-pair channe l. A pair-error is defined as a pair-read in which one or more of the symbols are read in error. The design of codes to protect e ffi iently against a certain number of pair-errors is signifi cant. Cassuto and Blaum first studied codes that protect against pa ir-errors in [2], as well as pair-error correctability cond itions, code construction and decoding, and lower and upper bounds o n code sizes. Later, Cassuto and Litsyn [3] gave algebraic cy clic code constructions of symbol-pair codes and asymptotic bou nds on code rates. They also showed the existence of pair-err or codes with rates strictly higher than those of the codes in th e Hamming metric with the same relative distance. Yaakobi et al. proposed efficient decoding algorithms for cyclic symbol-p air codes in [14]. Chee et al. in [4] established a Singleton-type bound on symb ol-pair codes and constructed infinite families of symbolpair codes that meet the Singleton-type bound, which are cal l d maximum distance separable symbol-pair codes or MDS symbol-pair codes for short. The construction of MDS symbol -pair codes is interesting since the codes have the best pair -error correcting capability for fixed length and dimension. The au thors in [4] made use of interleaving and graph theoretic con cepts as well as combinatorial configurations to construct MDS sym bol-pair codes. Kai et al. [8] constructed MDS symbol-pair c odes from cyclic and constacyclic codes. Classical MDS codes are MDS symbol-pair codes [4] and other k nown families of MDS(n, d)q symbol-pair codes are shown in Table I.

The parity check polynomial and encoder of these codes are obtained. The asymptotic behaviours of the rates and relative distances of this class of codes are studied by using a probabilistic method. We prove that, for any positive real number δ such that the asymptotic GV-bound at k + l 2 δ is greater than 1 2 , the relative distance of the code is convergent to δ , while the rate is convergent to 1 k + l . As a result, quasi-cyclic codes of fractional index are asymptotically good.	code	Jiafu Mi;Xiwang Cao	2018	Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.disc.2017.08.042	combinatorics;encoder;mathematics;real number;discrete mathematics;linear code;parity bit;hamming code;probabilistic method;expander code;polynomial	Theory	40.18620464410698	53.94842232285013	67684
6cddcf0d0e5ec7d83aebc350c5ace3dd0722b950	some generalizations of the concept of gröbner bases for differential ideals	polynomial ring	The problem of the membership of an element in a finitely generated ideal of the ordinary polynomial ring is completely solved by building a standard basis, e.g., Grrbner basis. However, this question remains open for a finitely generated ideal in a differential ring. At present, it has only been solved for a special case: for a perfect differential ideal, there exist at least two algorithms for determining whether an element belongs to the ideal. The first one, proposed by Ritt, is a method of the complete differential ideal decomposition into the intersection of simple differential ideals each of which is explicitly defined by its characteristic set. This algorithm is not very efficient and, hence, was not implemented. The second algorithm is described in [3] and is called the Rosenfeld-Grrbner algorithm. Its implementation and description are now included into the standard library of the Maple V system. The most important contribution to the analysis of the general case was made by Carra-Ferro, Ollivier, and Mansfield. Similar to the purely algebraic case, the differential Grrbner basis (DGB) is defined as the basis of the differential ideal such that each element is reduced to zero with respect to this basis. This leaves freedom in choosing the ordering of monomials and polynomial reduction technique. Since Ollivier's paper is a generalization of Carra-Ferro's paper, we will only examine Ollivier's and Mansfield's results and compare their definitions of DGB, along with the benefits and shortcomings of algorithms based on those definitions. We use the following notation: o ~ is a field of characteristic zero; U = {u l, u 2 . . . . . u m } is the set of infinitely differentiable functions of variables {xili = 1...n}; A = {~il, 82 . . . . . 8s} is the set of differential operators over the field o ~ with a preassigned action on elements from U; 0 is an arbitrary composition of operators from A;	algorithm;existential quantification;ferroelectric ram;gröbner basis;louis rosenfeld;maple;monomial;polynomial ring;standard library	T.

f959f9b659ebc43701435dd46eefea141e6664ca	on the distance between non-isomorphic groups	discrete mathematics;group theory;lower bound	A result of Ben-Or, Coppersmith, Luby and Rubinfeld on testi ng whether a map between two groups is close to a homomorphism implies a tight lower bound on the d istance between the multiplication tables of two non-isomorphic groups. In [2] Drápal showed that if◦ and ∗ are two binary operations on the finite set G such that(G,◦) and(G,∗) are non-isomorphic groups then the Hamming distance betwee n the two multiplication tables is greater than1 9|G| 2. In [3] infinite families of non-isomorphic pairs of 3-group s with distance exactly9|G| 2 are given. In this note we show that 9|G| 2 is a lower bound for the distance of arbitrary non-isomorphi c group structures. The proof is a simple application of the followi ng result from [1]. Fact 1. Let (G,◦) and (K,∗) be two groups and f :G → K be a map such that #{(x,y) ∈ G×G : f (x◦ y) = f (x)∗ f (y)} |G|2 > 7 9 . Then there exists a group homomorphism h:G → K such that #{x∈G: f (x)=h(x)} |G| ≥ 5 9 . Fact 1 is a weak version of Theorem 1 in [1]. Here is a brief sket ch of its proof. For everyx ∈ G, h(x) is defined as the value taken most frequently by the expressio n f (x◦ y)∗ f (y)−1 wherey runs overG. Then the first step is showing that for every x ∈ G, #{y ∈ G : f (x◦y)∗ f (y)−1 = h(x)} > 3|G|. The homomorphic property ofh and equality ofh(x) with f (x) for 5 9 of the possible elements x follow from this claim easily. We apply Fact 1 to obtain a result on the distance of multiplic ation tables of groups of not necessarily equal size. It will be convenient to state it in terms of a quan tity complementary to the distance. Let (G,◦) and(K,∗) be finite groups. We define the overlap between (G,◦) and(K,∗) as max γ :G→֒S,κ:K→֒S # 	emoticon;hamming distance;michael luby	Gábor Ivanyos;François Le Gall;Yuichi Yoshida	2012	Eur. J.

Switching activity estimation is a difficult task because it not only depends on the circuit structure but also on the input sequence. Probabilistic methods are one of the main approaches for solving this task. These methods frequently resort to binary decision diagrams (BDD) due to their properties; however, BDDs may grow excessively for large and complex circuits. In this paper we propose an optimized BDD structure for activity computation. The resulting BDDs attain significant reductions in the number of nodes without any accuracy loss. The proposal includes an activity operator definition by which the BDD elaboration has been automated and thus, many circuits could be analyzed confirming the theoretical advantages.	binary decision diagram	Felipe Machado;Yago Torroja;Teresa Riesgo	2008	J.

Knuth refers to the lexicographically least de Bruijn sequence for each n as the “granddaddy” and Fredricksen et al. showed that it can be constructed by concatenating the aperiodic prefixes of the binary necklaces of length n in lexicographic order. In this paper we prove that the granddaddy has a lexicographic partner. The “grandmama” sequence is constructed by instead concatenating the aperiodic prefixes in co-lexicographic order. We explain how our sequence differs from the previous sequence and why it had not previously been discovered.	de bruijn graph	Patrick Baxter Dragon;Oscar I.

8400baa6d85b9590cd3fd7cc9e029cf7e3550443	a short technical paper: determining whether a vote assignment is dominated	assignment;distributed system;asignacion;systeme reparti;sistema informatico;assignation;computer system;exclusion mutual;mutual exclusion;sistema repartido;voting;systeme informatique;voto;exclusion mutuelle;vote	One way to achieve mutual exclusion in a distributed system is to assign L’otes to each site in the system. If the total number of votes is odd, the assignment is known to be nondominated, meaning that no other assignment can provide strictly greater access and still achieve mutual exclusion. We characterize in this note dominated even-totaled vote assignments. As a consequence, we obtain that the problem of determining whether an even-totaled vote assignment is dominated is trivial if each site is assigned exactly one vote; however, the problem is N&complete in general. One way to achieve mutual exclusion in a distributed system is to assign votes to each site in the system; a group whose members hold more than half of the total votes is permitted to perform the restricted operation (see [2, 71, for example). A more general notion is that of coteries, introduced by Lamport [6] and studied at length by Oarcia-Moiina and Barbara [l]. A coterie is a collection of sets such that (1) Groups in the coterie satisfy the intersection property; that is, for every pair of sets G, H in the coterie, G f~ H +0, and (2) Groups in the coterie have the minima&y property; that is, for any pair of sets G, If in the coterie, neither G c H nor H c G holds. A group of sites in the distributed system is permitted to perform the restricted operation using coterie C if the group is a (not necessariIy proper) superset of some set in C. Thus a coterie provides a list of the groups that are permitted to perform the restricted action. For example, the coterie OEIsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc. 1991 655 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10010 280 SUSHIL JAJODIA AND DAVID MUTCHLER ((A,B),(A, C),(B,C}) says that any group of sites containing two of the three sites (A,B,C) are permitted to perform the restricted operation, while the coterie ((B}} says that groups containing site B are the distinguished groups. Let R and S be two coteries. We say R is dominated [l] by S if R f S, and moreover, for every set G in R, there is a set H in S such that H c G. R is said to be dominated if there exists a coterie S such that R is dominated by S; otherwise R is said to be nondominated. A dominated coterie should not be used because the dominating coterie provides strictly greater access while still preserving mutual exclusion. For example, the coterie {{A, B], {B, C}] is dominated by the coterie ((B}}. Any access permitted by the former is also permitted by the latter. For every vote assignment there is a corresponding coterie, built as follows: If U denotes the set of all sites in the system, first collect all the subsets of U whose votes sum to more than half of the total votes, and then discard from this collection all subsets of U that are proper supersets of other sets in the collection. (Interestingly, the reverse is not true: There exists coteries such that no vote assignment corresponds to them [l].) A dominated vote assignment is one that corresponds to a dominated coterie; a dominated vote assignment is likewise undesirable. Any vote assignment whose vote total is odd is nondominated [l]. We characterize in this note dominated even-totaled vote assignments. As a consequence, we obtain that the problem of determining whether an even-totaled vote assignment is dominated is trivial if each site is assigned exactly one vote; however, the problem is NP-complete in general. NOTATION. Let ok denote the votes given to site S,. Let TOT(r)) denote the total votes of assignment 0. THEOREM. Let c’ be a tote assignment for sites in set U such that the sum of the uotes in ~1 is even. Then c is dominated if and only if there is a group K c U such that Cs, t Kvk = TOT(c)/2. Proof. “If”: Suppose that LJ is dominated. Let S be the dominated coterie corresponding to c. By Theorem 2.1, page 844, of [l], it follows that there is a group G c U such that (1) every group in S intersects G, and (2) G is not a superset of any group in S. Now, C s, t G~k < TOT(u)/2, since otherwise G or a subset of it would be in S, contradicting (2). Likewise, Cs, E “_(;ck < TOT( u)/2, since otherwise U G or a subset of U G would be in S, contradicting (1). But the only way these two inequalities can hold simultaneously is if Es, E (;L’~ = TOT( v)/2, as desired, “Only if’: Suppose that there exists a group K c U such that xs, t K~)k = TOT(V)/2. Then consider the following vote assignment w for U: Give the WHETHER A VOTE ASSIGNMENT IS DOMINATED 281 same votes to all sites as ~1 does, except give one site in K an extra vote. Then w dominates 1’. n EXAMPLE. Consider the vote assignment I!(A) = 4, r,(B) = 2, r,(C) = 2, and r,(U) = 2. Since there does not exist a group K c (A, B,C, D) such that sum of the votes in K is exactly 5, it follows from our theorem that this assignment is nondominated. On the other hand, the vote assignment o(A) = 1, I,(B)= I, I,(C) = I, and L>(D) = 1 is dominated. The next two corollaries show that it is trivial to check domination for even-totaled vote assignments if each site is assigned a single vote; however, the problem is hard in general. COROLLARY 1.

First, we construct 1-resilient functions of n Boolean variables with nonlinearity 2n−1−2(n−1)/2, n odd. The Hadamard transform of these functions is 3-valued, which limits the efficiency of certain stream cipher attacks. From the case for n odd, we construct highly nonlinear 1-resilient functions which disprove a conjecture of Pasalic and Johansson for n even. Our constructions do not have a potential weakness shared by resilient functions which are formed from concatenation of linear functions. Second, we give a new construction for balanced Boolean functions with high nonlinearity, exceeding 2n−1−2(n−1)/2, which is not based on the direct sum construction. Moreover, these functions have high algebraic degree and large linear span. Third, we construct balanced vectorial Boolean functions with nonlinearity 2n−1 − 2(n−1)/2 and low maximum correlation. They can be used as nonlinear combiners for stream cipher systems with high throughput.	avalanche effect;bent function;boolean algebra;concatenation;correlation immunity;cryptography;encryption;hadamard transform;integral nonlinearity;kerr effect;lecture notes in computer science;library (computing);linear algebra;linear function;nonlinear system;residential gateway;s-box;software propagation;springer (tank);stream cipher;throughput	Khoongming Khoo;Guang Gong	2003		10.1007/3-540-45067-X_43	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;boolean network;boolean expression;nonlinear system;computer science;cryptography;mathematics;stream cipher;boolean function;algorithm;algebra	Crypto	41.63726443524114	42.85920252144347	68428

When feedback taps are located in small groups, a distinguishing attack can sometimes be improved considerably, compared to the common attack that uses low weight multiples. This class of weak polynomials was introduced in 2004 and the main property of the attack is that the noise variables are represented as vectors. We analyze the complexity of the attack using coding theory. We show that the groups of polynomials can be seen as generator polynomials of a convolutional code. Then, the problem of finding the attack complexity is equivalent to finding the minimum row distance of the corresponding generator matrix. A modified version of BEAST is used to search all encoders of memory up to 13. Moreover, we give a tight upper bound on the required size of the vectors in the attack.	algorithm;coding theory;convolutional code;data compression;distinguishing attack;encoder;generator matrix;nonlinear system;polynomial;power dividers and directional couplers	Martin Hell	2010	2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513760	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;convolutional code;theoretical computer science;mathematics;linear feedback shift register;statistics	Theory	40.36492726545095	55.65631040758629	68629

Let An denote the set of alternating permutations of {1, 2, . . . , n}, and let An(σ) be the set of alternating permutations in An that avoid a pattern σ. Recently, Lewis used generating trees to enumerate A2n(1234), A2n(2143) and A2n+1(2143), and he posed some conjectures on the Wilf-equivalence of alternating permutations avoiding certain patterns of length four. Some of these conjectures have been proved by Bóna, Xu and Yan. In this paper, we prove two conjectured relations |A2n+1(1243)| = |A2n+1(2143)| and |A2n(4312)| = |A2n(1234)|.	alternating turing machine;enumerated type;relation (database);turing completeness	Joanna N.

If in the above definition “exactly one” is replaced by “at most one” we have the definition of a partial t-partition. The number 1 S 1 is called the order of the (partial) t-partition (S, t). A (partial) t-partition in which all of the blocks have the same size is called a (partial) Steiner system. In what follows we will denote a (partial) Steiner system of order v with block size k by S(t, k, u). It is well-known that a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for the existence of a S(t, k, V) Steiner system is that (~:~)/(~:~) be an integer for every i = 0, 1,2,..., t 1; and that if (S, r) is a S(t, k, U) Steiner system then 1 T 1 = (r)/(F). If (S, P) is a partial S(t, k, v) Steiner system then 1 P 1 < (y)/(:). The reader is referred to the papers’ by H. Hanani [2] and A. Rosa and J. Doyen [l] for a fairly up-to-date account of Steiner systems. By a partial parallel class of blocks of the Steiner system (S, T) is meant a collection w of pairwise disjoint blocks of T. If the blocks of VT partition S then m is called a parallel class of blocks. Of course not every S(t, k, U) Steiner system has a parallel class (e.g., when u is not a multiple of	block size (cryptography);emoticon;maximal set;steiner tree problem	Ronald C. Mullin;Charles C.

Consider a scenario where the service provider has implemented an (n<sub>1</sub>, k<sub>1</sub>, B, d<sub>1</sub>, t<sub>1</sub>) functional MSR code based DSS, where B is the file that is stored. At a later point of time, due to certain considerations (such as storage cost, download bandwidth to repair failed nodes etc.), the service provider wants to convert this (n<sub>1</sub>, k<sub>1</sub>, B, d<sub>1</sub>, t<sub>1</sub>) functional MSR code based DSS to an (n<sub>2</sub>, k<sub>2</sub>, B, d<sub>2</sub>, t<sub>2</sub>) functional MSR code based DSS. The service provider wants to perform this conversion at the lowest possible cost, i.e., by downloading the minimum amount of data. The question is: How should one design an (n<sub>1</sub>, k<sub>1</sub>, B, d<sub>1</sub>, t<sub>1</sub>) functional MSR code based DSS so that it requires minimum download to convert the DSS to an (n<sub>2</sub>, k<sub>2</sub>, B, d<sub>2</sub>, t<sub>2</sub>) functional MSR code based DSS?

This question also has applications to cryptography, since cryptographic systems based on algebraic curves generally require a Jacobian of non-smooth order in order to foil certain types of attacks. There a variety of methods for accomplishing this task; some are general, while others are only applicable to specific types of curves. In the interest of space, we forego citing most the large volume of literature on elliptic and hyperelliptic curves in detail, and mention only two sources. Kedlaya’s padic algorithm for hyperelliptic curves [23, 24] is particularly well-suited to fields of small characteristic and has since been extended to Artin-Schreier extensions [14, 26, 27], superelliptic curves [17, 28], Cab curves [15], and more general curves [18, 13]; see also the survey by Kelaya [25]. A very different approach was first given by Schoof for elliptic curves [37]; this method was generalized to Abelian varieties by Pila [30, 31] and improved by Adleman and Huang [1, 2]. The Adleman-Huang algorithm computes the characteristic polynomial of the Frobenius endomorphism of an Abelian variety of dimension d in projective N -space over a finite field Fq in time O(log(q)δ) where δ depends polynomially on d and N .

DEFINITION OF THE CELL POLYNOMIAL OF A For A E ab let C = C(&) = (Ci1, C,, ..., CiJ and N = N ( A ) = ( i l , i2, ..., ic) denote the set of all cells and of all cell indices (labels), respectively (note that if C = 0, then N = 0).

We compute the probability of occurrence of these properties and present practical algorithms for each of these new properties. We find a new structural property for the AES S-box, which also holds for a large class of permutation functions when the dimension n is even. Moreover, we prove a relation with the propagation characteristics of a vectorial function and extend the scope of non-APN functions for n even.	algebraic petri net;algorithm;block cipher;cryptanalysis;cryptography;linear approximation;polynomial;public-key cryptography;randomness;s-box;software propagation;stream cipher	An Braeken;Christopher Wolf;Bart Preneel	2005		10.1007/11586821_13	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;characteristic function;boolean expression;cryptography;invariant;affine transformation;mathematics;permutation;coding;boolean function;algorithm;statistics;algebra	Crypto	41.97907471065127	43.97170996928441	70153

Then we propose that such internal flexibility can be utilized to compensate for the negative effects of both internal and external changes. More specifically, we report results of an experimental study that we performed on an integrated circuit fabricated for nonlinear dynamics-based computing, where we overheated the circuit to a point that its operation and performance changed, but then we reprogramed the circuit so that the overheated circuit could again perform the same operations reliably. This inherent flexibility and reprogrammability opens the door to implementing adaptive circuits and systems that can withstand both variable environments and adverse conditions.	adaptive filter;adaptive system;experiment;integrated circuit;mit engineering systems division;nonlinear dynamics;reconfigurable computing	Behnam Kia;Akshay Parnami;Allen Mendes;William L.

2e1b7d219bb603c72ee619d21565dc928c7866ec	a simplified method for computing the key equivocation for additive-like instantaneous block encipherers	vector space	Abstract   We study the problem of computing the key equivocation rate for secrecy systems with additive-like instantaneous block (ALIB) encipherers. In general it is difficult to compute the exact value of the key equivocation rate for a secrecy system   (  f  ,  C  )   with ALIB encipherer when the block length  n  becomes large. In this paper, we propose a simplified method for computing the key equivocation rate for two classes of secrecy systems with ALIB encipherers. 1) The function  f  is additive-like and the block encipherer  C  is the set of all  n -length key words (sequences) of type  P  . 2) The function  f  is additive and the block encipherer  C  is a linear ( n ,  m ) code in the  n -dimensional vector space GF( q )  n  . The method has a potential use for more classes of secrecy systems.	additive model	Zhaozhi Zhang	2005	Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics	10.1016/j.endm.2005.07.052	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;vector space;theoretical computer science;mathematics	Theory	36.09668339220717	60.01640965279543	70183

Therefore, we describe a way to find a doubly infinite nested lattice partition chain for the two-complex dimensional case in order to realize interference alignment onto these lattices and a procedure to find the minimum solution of the mean square error related to the corresponding channel quantization. Besides, we propose a new methodology based on support function and Steiner points of fuzzy vectors to relate the closest points in a lattice. Such a methodology is flexible enough to combine the fuzzy characterization with the geometric insights.	exemplification;futures studies;fuzzy logic;interference (communication);linear algebra;mean squared error;proximity problems;steiner tree problem;systematic review;telecommunications network	Ricardo Augusto Watanabe;Cibele Cristina Trinca Watanabe;Yan.

However, the methods which underlie these algorithms do not appear to be easily adaptable for finding discrete logarithms in the groups associated with elliptic curves and the Jacobians of hyperelliptic curves. This has led to the development of cryptographic systems based on the discrete logarithm problem for such groups [12, 7, 8]. In this paper a Subexponential algorithm is presented for finding discrete logarithms in the group of rational points on the Jacobians of large genus hyperelliptic curves over finite fields. We give a heuristic argument that under certain assumptions, there exists a c  >0 such that for all sufficiently large g  Z >0, for all odd primes p with log p  (2g + 1).98, the algorithm computes discrete logarithms in the group of rational points on the Jacobian of a genus g hyperelliptic curve over GF(p) within expected time: L  p2g+1[1/2, c] where c  2.181.	algorithm;discrete logarithm	Leonard M.

We demonstrate how this methodology can be used to design circuits that solve function-fitting problems through iterated gradient descent. In particular, we show how to build a small circuit that can model a nonlinearity by observation, and predistort to compensate for this nonlinearity. The system fits into a broader effort to investigate non-traditional approaches to circuit design. First, it breaks the traditional input-output abstraction barrier; all ports are bidirectional. Second, it uses primarily local properties of the circuit to show stability. Such stability arguments can be scaled to much more complex systems than traditional stability criteria.	abstraction layer;analogue electronics;circuit design;complex systems;convex optimization;fits;gradient descent;iteration;nonlinear system	Piotr Mitros	2008	2008 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2008.4541368	equivalent circuit;mixed-signal integrated circuit;gradient descent;network synthesis filters;input/output;computer vision;mathematical optimization;complex systems;electronic engineering;analogue electronics;computer science;electrical engineering;operating system;circuit design;control theory;mathematics	EDA	26.048888172099616	49.71425414233673	70672

We define a nonlinear equivalence class consisting of filter generators of length n that generate a binary keystream of period dividing 2−1, and investigate certain cryptographic properties of the ciphers in this class. We show that a number of important cryptographic properties, such as algebraic immunity and nonlinearity, are not invariant among elements of the same equivalence class. It follows that analysis of cipher-components in isolation presents some limitations, as it most often involves investigating cryptographic properties that vary among equivalent ciphers. Thus in order to assess the resistance of a cipher against a certain type of attack, one should in theory determine the weakest equivalent cipher and not only a particular instance. This is however likely to be a very difficult task, when we consider the size of the equivalence class for ciphers used in practice; therefore assessing the exact cryptographic properties of a cipher appears to be notoriously difficult.	cryptography;linear algebra;linear-feedback shift register;nonlinear system;stream cipher;turing completeness	Sondre Rønjom;Carlos Cid	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-13858-4_3	differential cryptanalysis;discrete mathematics;theoretical computer science;block size;key schedule;avalanche effect;correlation attack;mathematics;stream cipher;t-function;algorithm;linear cryptanalysis	Security	41.83361305285648	45.01841603726752	70965

In this paper we strengthen this property into the “predictable leading monomial” property, and show that this PLM property is shared by minimal Gröbner bases for any positional term order (here: TOP and POT) in F[x]q. The property is useful particularly for minimal interpolationtype problems. Because of the presence of zero divisors, minimal Gröbner bases over a finite ring of the type ℤpr (where p is a prime integer and r is an integer > 1) do not have the PLM property. We show how to construct, from an ordered minimal Gröbner basis, a so-called minimal Gröbner p-basis that does have a PLM property. The parametrization of all shortest linear recurrence relations of a finite sequence over ℤpr is a type of problem for which this is useful and we include an illustrative example.	forney algorithm;gröbner basis;linear difference equation;monomial;polynomial;recurrence relation	Margreta Kuijper;Kristina Schindelar	2010	2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513685	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;convolutional code;recurrence relation;mathematics;linear system;terminology;statistics;polynomial;algebra	Logic	41.23392760500982	46.476306961386854	71165

Elementary abelian groups of order p4 or smaller are known to be DCI-groups, while those of sufficiently large rank are known not to be DCI-groups. The only published proof that elementary abelian groups of order p4 are DCI-groups uses Schur rings and does not work for p = 2 (which has been separately proven using computers). This paper provides a simpler proof that works for all primes. Some of the results in this paper also apply to elementary abelian groups of higher rank, so may be useful for completing our determination of which elementary abelian groups are DCI-groups. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Computational efficiency is desirable, and indeed essential if the TCAD system is to be used in manufacturing CAD involving statistical simulation. Conventional TCAD systems comprise robust, numerical process and device simulators which drive optimization of empirical device model parameters for circuit simulation. This optimization can miss parametric correlations, and hence the integrated system, although CPU-intensive, could yield non-unique (erroneous) predictions. Numerical mixed-mode device/circuit simulation would obviate this deficiency, but with a high cost of computation time. Alternatively, improvement of the TCAD system can possibly be afforded by incorporation of semi-numerical device models into the circuit simulator which have physical parameters that relate directly to the device structure. The resulting tool is an application-specific, computationally efficient mixed-mode simulator that can easily be integrated with the process simulator by a program that evaluates the model parameters firom the doping profile. We are developing such a simulator (MMSPICE), and the program (SUMM) which integrates it with SUPREM-3.	algorithmic efficiency;angular defect;central processing unit;computation;computer-aided design;crowding;doping (semiconductor);electronic circuit simulation;mathematical optimization;mixed-signal integrated circuit;numerical analysis;semiconductor industry;technology cad;time complexity;traffic collision avoidance system;very-large-scale integration	Joohyun Jin;Jerry G.

A brute-force check is the only known method to compute their weight distribution and distance distribution. On the other hand, it outputs also all closest word pairs in the code. In the black-box complexity model, the check is optimal among closest-pair algorithms. In this paper we provide a Gröbner basis technique to compute the weight/distance distribution of any systematic non-linear code. Also our technique outputs all closest pairs.

076b0402e164da15d1adeaab56b2b53335b91b3d	dna codes for nonadditive stem similarity		Abstract—DNA sequences are sequences with elements from the quaternary DNA alphabet {A,C,G, T }. An important property of them is their directedness and ability to form duplexes as a result of hybridization process, i.e., coalescing two oppositely directed sequences. In biological experiments exploiting this property it is necessary to generate an ensemble of such sequences (DNA codes) consisting of pairs of DNA sequences referred to as Watson–Crick duplexes. Furthermore, for any two words of the DNA code that do not form a Watson–Crick duplex, hybridization energy—stability measure of a potential DNA duplex—is upper bounded by a constant specified by conditions of an experiment. This problem can naturally be interpreted in terms of coding theory. Continuing our previous works, we consider a nonadditive similarity function for two DNA sequences, which most adequately models their hybridization energy. For the maximum cardinality of DNA codes based on this similarity, we establish a Singleton upper bound and present an example of an optimal construction. Using ensembles of DNA codes with special constraints on codewords, which we call Fibonacci ensembles, we obtain a random-coding lower bound on the maximum cardinality of DNA codes under this similarity function.	code word;coding theory;dna microarray;duplex (telecommunications);experiment;similarity measure;thomas j. watson research center;watson (computer)	Arkadii G.

Their first algorithm recovers two addends by directly using rigorous Coppersmith's bivariate integer method when the error bounds of given approximations to A and B are less than $$N^{\frac{1}{6}}$$. Then by combining with the linearization technique, they improved this theoretical bound to $$N^{\frac{1}{4}}$$. In this paper, we heuristically reach the bound $$N^{\frac{1}{4}}$$ with experimental supports by transforming the integer polynomial concerned in their first algorithm into a modular one. Then we describe a better heuristic algorithm, the dimension of the lattice involved in this improved method is much smaller under the same error bounds.

b14168b270af093446d300bd4f07cfc4231fef55	a family of six-weight reducible cyclic codes and their weight distribution		Reducible cyclic codes with exactly two nonzero weights were first studied by T. Helleseth [4] and J. Wolfmann [15]. Later on, G. Vega [11], set forth the sufficient numerical conditions in order that a cyclic code, constructed as the direct sum of two one-weight cyclic codes, has exactly two nonzero weights, and conjectured that there are no other reducible two-weight cyclic codes of this type. In this paper we present a new class of cyclic codes constructed as the direct sum of two one-weight cyclic codes. As will be shown, this new class of cyclic codes is in accordance with the previous conjecture, since its codes have exactly six nonzero weights. In fact, for these codes, we will also give their full weight distribution, showing that none of them can be projective. On the other hand, recently, a family of six-weight reducible cyclic codes and their weight distribution, was presented by Y. Liu, et al. [7]; however it is worth noting that, unlike what is done here, the codes in such family are constructed as the direct sum of three irreducible cyclic codes.

1a9b50a345ca0bdbab098317df9edfa17658b678	improving the period and linear span of the sequences generated by dlfsrs		Many proposals of pseudorandom sequence generators and stream ciphers employ linear feedback shift registers with dynamic feedback (DLFSR) as the main module to increase the period and linear span of the involved msequences. In this paper, we present a theoretical model that allows the design of longer sequences with higher linear span than in previous DLFSR schemes. The model determines the constant relationship between period and linear span for these structures. These more complex sequences here obtained improve the proposals based on LFSR with dynamic feedback found in the literature.	linear-feedback shift register;pseudorandom number generator;pseudorandomness;span and div;stream cipher;theory	Alberto Peinado;Jorge Munilla;Amparo Fúster-Sabater	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-07995-0_39	discrete mathematics;cryptography;shift register;linear span;linear feedback shift register;pseudorandom number generator;mathematics;stream cipher	Crypto	42.04928017000782	46.08816842322457	72179

We show that the order certified version of the discrete logarithm over general finite fields (OCDL, in symbols) reduces to the discrete logarithm over algebraic tori (TDL, in symbols) with respect to the polynomial-time Turing reducibility. This reduction means that if the integer factorization can be computed in polynomial time, then  TDL  is equivalent to the discrete logarithm  DL  over general finite fields with respect to the Turing reducibility.

Using a new approach, with certain auxilary lists, it is proved that the ordinary simplex algorithm (“Most Negative Rule”) can be performed in O ( m 2 + m log n ) computer operations per iteration, as against O ( mn ) in the usual approach. A search-in-a-row simplex algorithm (“Row Most Negative Rule”), for which the total number of iterations is probably only somewhat larger, is shown to require just O ( m + σm log n ) operations per iteration, where σ is the density of the cost matrix (i.e. the proportion of admissible paths). For these rigorous results one needs computer storage which is not considerably larger than that required for storing the cost matrix. For smaller memory an efficient algorithm is also proposed. A general tentative rule for die amount of scanning per iteration is introduced and applied. Computer experiments are reported, confirming theoretical estimates.	algorithm;fast fourier transform	Achi Brandt;Jacob Intrator	1978	Computers & OR	10.1016/0305-0548(78)90035-7	transportation theory;mathematical optimization;fuzzy transportation;computer science;mathematics	Theory	38.07996138499957	37.380187859799435	72251

Even so, they remain vulnerable to the loss of any given data disk and the parity disks of its two stripes. We show how to eliminate all but one of these fatal triple failures by entangling the parity disks of the array, that is, XORing the contents of each parity disk with that of its predecessors. As a result, our new organization reduces the number of fatal triple failures by 96 to 99 percent and the number of fatal quadruple failures by around 85 percent without the need for any additional hardware.	computer data storage;disk storage;floppy disk;parity bit;parity drive;quadruple-precision floating-point format;raid;stripes	Jehan-François Pâris;Vero Estrada-Galiñanes;Ahmed M Amer;Carlos Rincon	2017	2017 IEEE 36th International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC)	10.1109/PCCC.2017.8280454	real-time computing;parallel computing;parity (mathematics);computer science;raid;fault tolerance;parity drive	Arch	36.41277272469047	57.0328936462327	72253

We prove that computing the order of points on elliptic curves over ZN is as difficult as factoring N, in the sense of randomly polynomial time reduction. Therefore, cryp-tosystems based on the difficulty of computing the order of points on elliptic curves over the ring ZN will be at least as robust as those based on the difficulty of factoring N. Factorization of large integers is an extensively studied problem, due to its cryptographic applications. In fact, the security of some cryptosystems as RSA [1] is believed to lie on the difficulty of factoring a certain integer N = pq. On the other hand, elliptic curves have become more and more used in cryptography in the last decade, directly for designing new cryptosystems [2], as well as in the design of factorization algorithms [3] and primality tests [4,5]. In most cryptographic applications of elliptic curves, knowing the order of the group of points or the order of some points on the elliptic curve is required. Schoof's algorithm [6], and its improvements [7], are the known methods to solve this problem for elliptic curves over the field Zp. Nevertheless, the above algorithms are useless if the elliptic curve is defined over the ring ZN, where N is a composite integer. In this letter, the definition of elliptic curve over ZN, where N is square-free, is given. We show that N can be easily factored with high probability, with an oracle providing the order of any point on such a curve.

The COI method considers parametric as well as catastrophic faults. A strict distinction between the operational environment, defined by the specifications of the circuit, and the test environment, defined by the test configuration and the test equipment, is introduced. A parametric fault model is developed that combines circuit specifications, statistical parameters reflecting parametric faults, and measurements of the circuit under test. These measurements are called characteristic observations. For each specification, a test inference criterion is computed using feature extraction and logistic discrimination analysis. From a set of such criteria the satisfaction or violation of the specifications can be inferred from characteristic observations. Based on these results, additional test criteria for catastrophic faults are determined using test set compaction. Moreover, measurement noise and parasitic effects, which crucially influence the test design, are systematically considered, and a physically interpretable sampling strategy is presented. The COI method applied to two different test designs yields very good results with respect to parametric faults as well as to catastrophic faults.	analogue electronics;built-in test equipment;catastrophic interference;data compaction;deployment environment;fault model;feature extraction;sampling (signal processing);test design;test set	Walter M.

Among other things, this is used to conclude that all Hamiltonian regular graphs of odd order possess strong VMTLs. A relationship is then demonstrated between regular graphs of even degree and sparse magic squares. We next consider cubic graphs of order $2n$ consisting of two 2-factors of order $n$, connected by a 1-factor (quasi-prisms). Based on McQuillan’s construction of VMTLs of such 3-regular graphs, VMTLs are derived for similar regular graphs of any odd degree. Finally, a construction is given for VMTLs of quartic graphs of order $4n+2$ consisting of two cycles of odd order $n$ connected by a 2-factor (simple quasi-anti-prisms), and based on this construction VMTLs are derived for similar regular graphs of any even degree.

d7417da6ed103a17bd78962e966d64bf86f5792f	the macwilliams identity for m-spotty rosenbloom-tsfasman weight enumerator		The communication systems and disk or tape memory can sometimes cause clusters of errors, namely burst errors. There have been many designs in order to detect and even correct such errors. Recently, a new class of codes called m-spotty byte error correcting codes has found applications in high speed memory systems that employ random access memory chips wide Input/Output data, especially at 8, 16, or 32 bits. The MacWilliams identity provides the relationship between the weight distribution of a code and that of its dual code. Also, an interesting new metric called Rosenbloom–Tsfasman metric has been studied as an alternative metric for linear codes recently. In this paper, we combine these two interesting topics and introduce the m-spotty Rosenbloom–Tsfasman weights and the m-spotty Rosenbloom–Tsfasman weight enumerator of a binary code. Moreover, we prove a MacWilliams identity for the m-spotty Rosenbloom–Tsfasman weight enumerators.	enumerator polynomial	Mehmet Ozen;Vedat Siap	2014	J.

Large CBL cells with wire bonding have a reduction of the substrate noise effect, with respect to CMOS, by a factor of 2.5, whereas CSL is noisier than CMOS. This agrees with the simulations. The moderate noise improvement shown in the simulations by CBL circuits with complementary outputs is not confirmed experimentally. The results here show that previous evaluations based on the amplitude of the supply current spikes are unsuitable to assess the real noise performance.	cmos;composite blocking list;digital electronics;emitter-coupled logic;experiment;logic family;mixed-signal integrated circuit;simulation;wire bonding	Edgar F.

The first step is defining a suitable computational model for functions over the reals. Computability and complexity over discrete spaces have been very well studied since the 1930s. Different approaches have been proved to yield equivalent definitions of computability and nearly equivalent definitions of complexity. From the tradition of formal logic we have the notions of recursiveness and Turing machine. From computational complexity we have Turing machine variants and abstract Random Access Machines (RAMs). All of these converge to define the same well-accepted notion of computability. The Church-Turing thesis asserts that this formal notion of computability is broad enough, at least in the discrete setting, to include all functions that could reasonably be construed to be computable. In the continuous setting, where the objects are numbers in R, computability and complexity have received less attention, and there is no one accepted computation model. Alan Turing defined the notion of a single computable real number in his landmark 1936 paper [Tur36]: a real number is computable if its decimal expansion can be computed in the discrete sense (i.e., output by some Turing machine). But he did not go on to define the notion of computable real function. There are now two main approaches to modeling computation with real number inputs. The first approach, which we call the bit-model and which is the subject of this paper, reflects the fact that computers can store only finite approximations to real numbers. Roughly speaking, a real function f is computable in the bit model if there is an algorithm which, given a good rational approximation to x , finds a good rational approximation to f (x). The second approach is the algebraic approach, which abstracts away the messiness of finite approximations and assumes that real numbers can be represented exactly and each arithmetic operation can be performed exactly in one step. The complexity of a computation is usually taken to be the number of arithmetic operations (for example, additions and multiplications) performed. The algebraic approach applies naturally to arbitrary rings and fields, although for modeling scientific computation the underlying structure is usually R or C. Algebraic complexity theory goes back to the 1950s (see [BM75, BCS97] for surveys). For scientific computing the most influential model in the algebraic setting is due to Blum, Shub, and Smale (BSS) [BSS89]. The model and its theory are thoroughly developed in the book [BCSS98] Mark Braverman is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto.

a4bdfbc96b3ef61a23ed70e8fd1a4b69f50b32b6	nearly optimal codebooks based on generalized jacobi sums		Codebooks with small inner-product correlation are applied in many practical applications including direct spread code division multiple access (CDMA) communications, space-time codes and compressed sensing. It is extremely difficult to construct codebooks achieving the Welch bound or the Levenshtein bound. Constructing nearly optimal codebooks such that the ratio of its maximum cross-correlation amplitude to the corresponding bound approaches 1 is also an interesting research topic. In this paper, we firstly study a family of interesting character sums called generalized Jacobi sums over finite fields. Then we apply the generalized Jacobi sums and their related character sums to obtain two infinite classes of nearly optimal codebooks with respect to the Welch or Levenshtein bound. The codebooks can be viewed as generalizations of some known ones and contain new ones with very flexible parameters.	code;codebook;compressed sensing;cross-correlation;imax;jacobi method;memory bound function;set packing;welch's method	Ziling Heng	2018	Discrete Applied Mathematics	10.1016/j.dam.2018.05.017	code division multiple access;compressed sensing;mathematics;discrete mathematics;combinatorics;amplitude;generalization;correlation;finite field	Theory	41.80839238972626	50.11683487690797	73297

So, a compression technique must be applied to reduce the overhead of processing, storing, and transmission. Blocking compressive sampling matching pursuit (BCoSaMP) algorithm is a recursive algorithm which provides an accurate reconstruction of sparse signal from a small number of noisy samples. It doesn't assume that the noise is Gaussian or bounded but it uses information about the noise magnitude for stopping criterion. However, BCoSaMP is a computationally intensive algorithm. So, BCoSaMP algorithm has been implemented on both field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and graphic processing units (GPU) by exploiting parallel and pipelining approaches. A new software tool called radar signal processing tool (RSPT) is also presented. It allows the designer to auto-generate fully optimized VHDL representation of BCoSaMP by specifying many user input parameters through graphical user interface (GUI). Moreover, it provides the designer a feedback on various performance parameters. This offer the designer the ability to make any adjustments to the BCoSaMP component until gets the desired performance of the overall system-on-chip (SoC). Our simulation results indicate that the achieved speed-up of FPGA and GPU over the sequential one is improved by up to 14 and 10.7, respectively.	algorithm;compressed sensing;field-programmable gate array;graphics processing unit;matching pursuit	Amin Jarrah;Mohsin M.

An explicit construction of regenerating codes that perform reliability, availability and security of the stored data, and at the same time perform efficient node repair is already provided. Understanding and achieving the optimal tradeoff among the above listed features is of great importance for improving the functioning in all cloud storage systems. Therefore in this work, we propose a new code construction that includes an outer and an inner code in the process. The outer code, Gabidulin code, as a pre-coding step achieves improved security level in the storage system and the inner one, Twin-code framework, performs efficient distribution, reconstruction and repair process. The proposed code is resilient to an eavesdropper model and gives better results regarding the achievements when are used the minimum bandwidth regenerating (MBR) and minimum storage regenerating (MSR) codes, respectively.	cloud storage;computer data storage;concatenated error correction code;information-theoretic security	Ninoslav Marina;Natasha Paunkoska;Aneta Velkoska	2016	2016 8th International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)	10.1109/ICUMT.2016.7765384	computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;computer security	OS	35.7633337290311	58.857736354754365	73590

They are first shown to be non-equivalent, then a low-complexity method to generate symmetric puncturing patterns is proposed, which performs a search tree algorithm with limited depth, over the rows of GN. Symmetric patterns are further optimized by density evolution, and shown to yield better performance than state-of-the-art rate compatible code constructions, relying on either puncturing or shortening techniques.	algorithm;anti-pattern;brute-force search;computer simulation;generator matrix;grid north;list of algorithms;polar code (coding theory);puncturing;search algorithm;search tree;software design pattern;turing completeness	Ludovic Chandesris;Valentin Savin;David Declercq	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC Workshops)	10.1109/ICCW.2017.7962751	telecommunications;mathematics	Robotics	42.406813905663654	60.01987794493044	73605

We give theoretical constructions of Toeplitz MDS matrices and show that they achieve the minimum XOR count. We also prove that Toeplitz matrices cannot be both MDS and involutory. Further we give theoretical constructions of 4 × 4 involutory MDS matrices over F24 and F28 that have the best known XOR counts so far: for F24 our construction gives an involutory MDS matrix that actually improves the existing lower bound of XOR count, whereas for F28 , it meets the known lower bound.	block cipher;degree (graph theory);exclusive or;mds matrix;polynomial basis;toeplitz hash algorithm	Sumanta Sarkar;Habeeb Syed	2016	IACR Trans.

In this paper we study shadows of lattices mostly to construct unimodular lattices in higher dimensions. We introduce shadow-optimal lattices which are a class of optimal Type I lattices by investigating theta series of optimal Type I lattices. These lattices are used to construct unimodular lattices by the above construction. An analogy between self-dual codes over the ring Z2k of integers and unimodular lattices is found. We also study shadow codes for Type I codes over Z2k by considering shadow lattices. c © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.	dual code;shadow volume;unimodular polynomial matrix	Steven T.

We propose a self-learning architecture, with a threshold-lock loop that feeds back a spike sorting performance index to the FSM inside the adaptive spike detector.

These codes appear in a wide variety of contexts and applications, e.g., multiple access, cryptography, and information theory. This paper is devoted partly to the study of intersecting codes, and partly to their use in constructing large t-independent families of binary vectors. The latter subject has by now been extensively studied and has application in VLSI testing, defect correction, €-biased probability spaces, and derandomization. By concatenation methods we construct codes with the highest known rate asymptotically. We then generalize the concept to t-wise intersecting codes: we give bounds on the achievable rate of such codes, both existential and constructive. We show how t-wise intersecting codes can be used to obtain ( t + lbindependent families. With this method we obtain improved asymptotical constructions of t-independent families.

1f8e499cfeb722c393c02033d254fca2b4e1f139	a probabilistic algorithm for computing data-discriminants of likelihood equations	likelihood equation;maximum likelihood estimation;discriminant	An algebraic approach to the maximum likelihood estimation problem is to solve a very structured parameterized polynomial system called likelihood equations that have finitely many complex (real or non-real) solutions. The only solutions that are statistically meaningful are the real solutions with positive coordinates. In order to classify the parameters (data) according to the number of real/positive solutions, we study how to efficiently compute the discriminants, say data-discriminants (DD), of the likelihood equations. We develop a probabilistic algorithm with three different strategies for computing DDs. Our implemented probabilistic algorithm based on Maple and FGb is more efficient than our previous version [27] and is also more efficient than the standard elimination for larger benchmarks. By applying RAGlib to a DD we compute, we give the real root classification of 3 by 3 symmetric matrix model.	discriminant;geographic coordinate system;maple;randomized algorithm;system of polynomial equations	Jose Israel Rodriguez;Xiaoxian Tang	2017	J.

Such separation bounds are useful for testing whether a numerical polynomial is absolutely irreducible, given a certain tolerance on its coefficients. Using an absolute irreducibility criterion due to Ruppert, we are able to find useful separation bounds, in several norms, for bivariate polynomials. We also use Ruppert's criterion to derive new, more effective Noether forms for polynomials of arbitrarily many variables. These forms lead to small separation bounds for polynomials of arbitrarily many variables.	approximation algorithm;bivariate data;coefficient;eisenstein's criterion;integer-valued polynomial;irreducibility;noether's theorem;numerical analysis;ruppert's algorithm	Erich Kaltofen;John P.

859a90b439e963722b665d7b9d8e5caa94f9dbf8	an lp-lq-version of morgan's theorem for the n-dimensional euclidean motion group		An aspect of uncertainty principle in real classical analysis asserts that a function f and its Fourier transform ̂ f cannot decrease simultaneously very rapidly at infinity. As illustrations of this, one has Hardy’s theorem [1], Morgan’s theorem [2], and BeurlingHörmander’s theorem [3–5]. These theorems have been generalized to many other situations; see, for example, [6–10]. In 1983, Cowling and Price [11] have proved an Lp-Lq-version of Hardy’s theorem. An Lp-Lq-version of Morgan’s theorem has been also proved by Ben Farah and Mokni [7]. To state the Lp-Lq-versions of Hardy’s and Morgan’s theorems more precisely, we propose the following. Let a,b > 0, p,q ∈ [1,+∞], α≥ 2, and β such that 1/α+ 1/β = 1. If we consider measurable functions f on R such that	bell's theorem;morgan;uncertainty principle	Sihem Ayadi;Kamel Mokni	2007	Int. J.

Our method provides a practical way to compute #X(E/Q)(p) in many cases when traditional p-descent methods are completely impractical and also in situations where results of Kolyvagin do not apply, e.g., when the rank of the Mordell-Weil group is greater than 1. We apply our results along with a computer calculation to show that X(E/Q)[p] = 0 for the 1,534,422 pairs (E, p) consisting of a non-CM elliptic curve E over Q with conductor ≤ 30,000, rank ≥ 2, and good ordinary primes p with 5 ≤ p < 1000 and surjective mod-p representation.	mod database	William Stein;Christian Wuthrich	2013	Math.

For instance, it is not in a position to produce exact representations, of sets of the form {f(x, y, …, z):x ∊ X, y ∊ Y, …, z ∊ Z} even for simple functions f of one variable. We make use of another interval arithmetic which is very convenient for computer computations and for construction of interval algorithms. As an example we consider a method for the construction of interval expressions for sets of the form if {f(x):x ∊[x<inf>1</inf>, x<inf>2</inf>]}, where f is an elementary function.	algorithm;computation;elementary function;interval arithmetic;regular expression	Svetoslav Markov	1981	1981 IEEE 5th Symposium on Computer Arithmetic (ARITH)	10.1109/ARITH.1981.6159282	arithmetic;discrete mathematics;tin;computer science;elementary function;taylor series;theoretical computer science;mathematics;interval arithmetic;algorithm;algebra	Theory	47.76377127175881	38.2307798221667	75160

4438775ec24c360d4d76c14be0dd20b3d922e986	circulant graph imbeddings	circulant graph	Cayley graphs have been a central topic to topological graph theorists since Gustin [ 131, but much remains to be known about their imbeddings. White [20,2 1 ] and others view such graphs as a stepping stone to a comprehensive theory of graph imbeddings. The outstanding step in this direction is, of course, the Ringel and Youngs solution [ 171 to the Heawood map-coloring problem. The “neighborhood” N(x) of the vertex x in a graph G is the induced subgraph spanned by the vertices adjacent to x in G. The neighborhood structure of G plays an important role in the imbeddings of G. For example, if G has a triangular imbedding, then every N(x) must contain a Hamiltonian cycle; and it is of interest to know what conditions on the neighborhood structure enable G to have a triangular imbedding [2]. One such condition is that every N(x) be a cycle. We say G has “uniform neighborhood structure” N if every N(x) is isomorphic to the graph N. There has been much progress recently on problems concerning such graphs [4, 5, 8, 151. Such graphs can be expected to have interesting imbeddings. Since Cayley graphs have a uniform neighborhood structure which may be characterized algebraically (as are the graphs themselves), it is natural to consider those Cayley graphs with a fixed neighborhood structure N and to	circulant matrix;cycle (graph theory);four color theorem;gerhard ringel;graph (discrete mathematics);graph coloring;hamiltonian path;induced subgraph;magma;stepping level;topological graph	T.

This scheme allows one to reconstruct the initial plane up to isomorphism and polarity. It is shown that for a Desarguesian plane the corresponding scheme is non-Schurian. An association scheme W=(Q, LZ’= {Xi}isl) o rankr=\IIonafinitesetRisapair f consisting of 52 and a partition 57 of 52 x Q into r binary relations (digraphs) Xi satisfying the following conditions: (1) X,={(cc,cr): a&}&; (2) XE?Z”~X-‘E%, where X-’ ={(P,cI): (cq/?)~X}; (3) the numbers Pij(cC, p) = # {r: (CI, Y)EX~, (y, fl)EXj) do not depend on the choice of (~,/?)EX~ for all i, j, kel (these numbers ptj are called intersection numbers of the association scheme W). W is commutative if pt=p~i for all i, j, kEI. In particular, a symmetric scheme, i.e. one satisfying the condition Xi-’ =Xi for all iE1, is commutative. For each i, Xi defines a regular digraph ri =(Q, Xi) of valency ki =p$ where Xj = XL r. If all the antireflexive digraphs ri (distinct from r,) are connected, then the scheme is said to be primitive. The set of 2-orbits of a transitive permutation group (G, 52) (the orbits of induced action of G on Q x Q) generates an association scheme. A scheme (Q, 57) is Schurian if 57 is the set of 2-orbits of a permutation group acting on 52. In this case the scheme is also denoted by V(G,!S). An association scheme IV =(L?,Y) is a subscheme of W=(QE) if each relation of CY is a union of relations of S?“. Note that in order to obtain the lattice of subschemes of a scheme W, it is sufficient to know the intersection numbers of W. Correspondence to: LA.

In supersparse polynomials, the term degrees enter logarithmically as their numbers of binary digits into the size measure l. The factors are again represented as supersparse polynomials. If the factors are represented as straight-line programs or black box polynomials, we can achieve randomized polynomial-time in (l+d)O(1). Our approach follows that by H. W. Lenstra, Jr., on computing factors of univariate supersparse polynomials over algebraic number fields. We generalize our ISSAC 2005 results for computing linear factors of supersparse bivariate polynomials over the rational numbers by appealing to recent lower bounds on the height of algebraic numbers and to a special case of the former Lang conjecture.	algebraic equation;arjen lenstra;bivariate data;black box;issac;irreducibility;irreducible polynomial;linear algebra;linear function;rp (complexity);randomized algorithm;time complexity	Erich Kaltofen;Pascal Koiran	2006		10.1145/1145768.1145798	gegenbauer polynomials;difference polynomials;time complexity;fibonacci polynomials;combinatorics;height;discrete mathematics;koornwinder polynomials;jacobi polynomials;discrete orthogonal polynomials;elementary symmetric polynomial;algebraic number;schur polynomial;classical orthogonal polynomials;resultant;hahn polynomials;mathematics;factorization of polynomials;orthogonal polynomials;macdonald polynomials;upper and lower bounds;power sum symmetric polynomial;algebraically closed field;rational number;askey–wilson polynomials;algebra;wilson polynomials	Theory	42.94947459864782	38.57826323920807	75422

The course imparts a fundamental knowledge of simulation tools and of mobile communication systems. The simulation tool which is used in the course is COSSAP (Communication Systems Simulation and Analysis Package) and the considered communication system is GSM (Global System for Mobile communications). In this paper we give an introduction into COSSAP, into GSM and especially into the course structure. In addition, some simulation results will be given, i.e. the improvement of soft decision decoding versus hard decision decoding. each model of the system. If one wants to use a function which is not available within the existing libraries. there are two possibilities in order to extend the collection of models. New models may be generated either by creating so called hierarchical models, i.e. already existing models may be combined to one block, or by implementing a new function as a source code in C or Fortran. Models which are created in the second way are called primitive models. Because the usage of existing models is transparent for the user, he does not need to know anything about the model implementation but only the relation between input and output and the model specific parameters. Therefore it is quite easy to reuse existing models for other simulations or projects. 1. THE SIMULATION TOOL COSSAP 2. ON THE GSM SYSTEM COSSAP is a stream driven, block oriented simulation environment from Cadis GmbH Aachen, Germany[5]. The simulation package includes all tools which are necessary for building up a configuration, running the simulation and presenting the results in a graphical or numerical manner. Furthermore, it provides some tools for postprocessing of the obtained results, e.g. correlation, fourier transformation, interpolation etc. An important feature is the optional generation of VHDLVery High Description Language-Code and/or code for digital signal processors. To build up a simulation, out of an extensive library the appropriate models are selected. This library is already provided by COSSAP. After placing the models on the simulation screen, they have to be connected with signal lines. In the next step all models have The mobile communication system which is investigated in the course is GSM. We have chosen this system because it is an “up-to-date” digital mobile communication system which covers all relevant aspects of mobile communication. In the year 1979, the frequency range around 900 MHz was reserved for an uniform european communication system. There were several proposals for such a system which were taken into consideration when specifying the final recommendations for GSM. Meanwhile, a lot of european countries have built up communication systems according to the GSM specification and also some noneuropean countries have taken over the GSM standard. 1129 0-7803-2431-5/95 $4.00	bayesian network;central processing unit;digital signal processor;fortran;frequency band;graphical user interface;input/output;interpolation;library (computing);mobile phone;need to know;numerical analysis;systems simulation	Adrian Donder;M.

We determine with the accuracy of ±1 the maximal number of β-fractional positions, which may arise as a result of addition of two β-integers. For the infinite word uβ coding distances between the consecutive β-integers, we determine precisely also the balance. The word uβ is the only fixed point of the morphism A → Am−1B and B → Am−n−1B. In the case n = 1, the corresponding infinite word uβ is sturmian, and, therefore, 1-balanced. On the simplest non-sturmian example with n ≥ 2, we illustrate how closely the balance and the arithmetical properties of β-integers are related.

It discusses synopsis of the data types, roundings as well as digital versions of ultra-arithmetic operations. Methods of numerical analysis require a computational environment in which a variety of data types and associated arithmetic operations are available as computer primitives. The operations and constructs of mathematics that can be implemented directly in digital computers are far greater in number than those that are currently implemented. In a sense, the digital computer can be made to appear as a deeper and somewhat more accurate image of mathematical constructs and operations than it is at present. This is the viewpoint of ultra-arithmetic where the structures, data types, and operations corresponding to functions are developed for direct digital implementation. A digital computer designed or equipped with ultra-arithmetic will be a far more congenial tool for scientific computation. The point of view of ultra-arithmetic is to develop the numerical treatment of these problems in such a manner that their numerical solution may be reduced to computer operations in a direct sense.	computer	Willard L.

The method is based on a tournament scheme, with the sequence arranged into pairs, where maxima (‘winners’) are encoded recursively, and minima are encoded by semi-fixed-length codes using the related maxima to bound the code lengths. In the experiments, tournament coding has outperformed the other non-statistical methods (gamma, delta, Fibonacci and interpolative coding) for uniform distribution of numbers. Also for non-uniform distributions the method is quite competitive.		Jukka Teuhola	2009	Comput.

The solution addresses the observability problem of the equalizer and results in a testable design that can be easily characterized and cost-effectively tested in the production line. To validate the proposed method, we conducted experiments for examples with various injected faults, for which the conventional approach of examining the eye opening at the output of the equalizer results in poor fault coverage.

We find that, contrary to the results reported in [8], pairing calculation on supersingular genus 2 curves over prime fields is efficient and a viable candidate for the practical implementation of pairing-based cryptosystems. We also show how to eliminate divisions in an efficient manner when computing the Tate pairing, and how this algorithm is useful for curves of genus greater than one.	algorithm;cryptosystem;declan mccullagh;distortion;fastest;genus (mathematics);period-doubling bifurcation	Colm O'hEigeartaigh;Michael Scott	2006		10.1007/978-3-540-74462-7_21	arithmetic;supersingular elliptic curve;discrete mathematics;pairing;mathematics;algebra	Crypto	44.998063586661644	40.15800997347635	76301

This result is generally established by an appeal to the theorem of elementary group theory that asserts that x|G| = 1 for every element x of a finite group G. In this note we describe another way that group theory can be used to establish Fermat’s little theorem and related results.	fermat	I. M. Isaacs;M. R.

We show that quantum walk algorithms are extremely sensitive to systematic errors. We present a recursive algorithm which offers significant robustness to certain systematic errors. To search N items, our recursive algorithm can tolerate errors of size $$O(1{/}\sqrt{\ln N})$$O(1/lnN) which is exponentially better than quantum walk algorithms for which tolerable error size is only $$O(\ln N{/}\sqrt{N})$$O(lnN/N). Also, our algorithm does not need any ancilla qubit. Thus our algorithm is much easier to implement experimentally compared to quantum walk algorithms.

Comparing to the traditional complementary code sets, the Z-complementary code sets not only have more freedom on the code length, but also have much more mates. In this paper, lower bounds on periodic/aperiodic correlation of Z-complementary binary code sets with respect to the number of mates, family size, sequence length, the length of ZCZ, maximum periodic/aperiodic autocorrelation sidelobe inside the ZCZ and maximum periodic/aperiodic crosscorrelation value inside the ZCZ, are derived. The proposed lower bounds provide theoretical criteria for designing, optimizing and choosing Z-complementary code set in applications.

Several codes have been constructed using combinatorial designs and finite geometries. We introduce a new way of constructing authentication codes using LFSR-sequences. A central part of the construction is an encoding matrix derived from these LFSR-sequences. Necessary criteria for this matrix in order to give authentication codes that provides protection aginst impersonation and substitution attacks will be given. These codes also provide perfect secrecy if the source states have a uniform distribution. Moreover, the codes give a natural splitting of the key into two parts, one part used aginst impersonation attacks and a second part used against substitution attacks and for secrecy simultaneously. Since the construction is based on the theory of LFSR-sequences it is very suitable for implementation and a simple implementation of the construction is given.	authentication;code;man-in-the-middle attack;shift register	Thomas Johansson	1994	Des.

The exponential weight of a vector, an element of a finite field, is introduced. It is a primitive nth root of unity raised to the weight of a vector. Using the general representation of group codes via polynomials, a formula is obtained for the exponential weight of a code word as a function of the parameters of the general representation. The coefficients of the formula are obtained using elementary multiplication on the cyclic group of the nth roots of unity. The formula is, in general, quite complicated and requires a computer for computation of its explicit form. However, for the new practical codes of a highly algebraic nature (Bose-Chaudhuri, Cyclic, Polynomial, JumpShift Register codes which are characterized by simple field parameters and polynomials), the formula emerges more pliable. It is hoped that use of the formula will yield more precise errorcorrecting properties of a given group code (minimum weight of all non-zero vectors of a code) and the distribution of weights of a code.	code word;coefficient;computation;group code;let expression;minimum weight;polynomial;root of unity;time complexity	Gustave Solomon	1962	IRE Trans.

The restart approach is also applied to classical ring oscillators and the results obtained demonstrate that the new oscillators can achieve orders of magnitude higher entropy rates. A theoretical explanation is also provided. The restart and continuous modes of operation and a novel sampling method almost doubling the entropy rate are proposed. Accordingly, the new oscillators appear to be by far more effective than other known solutions for random number generation with logic gates only.	block cipher mode of operation;entropy rate;experiment;initial condition;logic gate;period-doubling bifurcation;random number generation;randomness;sampling (signal processing)	Markus Dichtl;Jovan Dj.

801614d1544728d25ffb484ce20ac2d5bfc49ab0	computing gcds of polynomials over algebraic number fields	good practice;a priori knowledge;computer experiment;rational number	Abstract   Modular methods for computing the gcd of two univariate polynomials over an algebraic number field require  a priori  knowledge about the denominators of the rational numbers in the representation of the gcd. A multiplicative bound for these denominators is derived without assuming that the number generating the field is an algebraic integer. Consequently, the gcd algorithm of Langemyr and McCallum [ J. Symbolic Computation  8 , 429 - 448, 1989] can now be applied directly to polynomials that are not necessarily represented in terms of an algebraic integer. Worst-case analyses and experiments with an implementation show that by avoiding a conversion of representation the reduction in computing time can be significant. A further improvement is achieved by using an algorithm for reconstructing a rational number from its modular residue so that the denominator bound need not be explicitly computed. Experiments and analyses suggest that this is a good practical alternative.	algebraic equation	Mark J. Encarnación	1995	J. Symb.

The area in which the number eld sieve has the greatest capacity for improvement is polynomial selection. The best known polynomial selection method nds quadratic polynomials. In this paper we examine the smoothness properties of integer values taken by these polynomials. Given a quadratic NFS polynomial, let be its discriminant. We show that p need only appear in the factor base if ( =p) = 1. Using this knowledge, we adapt a parameter , developed for analysis of MPQS, to quadratic NFS polynomials.

In this research, we first develop a methodology for determining if the DUT contains behaviors that are not explicitly included in its behavioral model. A complex (optimized) test waveform is applied to the DUT and its test response signature is captured. It is seen that in the presence of unexpected DUT behaviors, the residual error in the test response signature from that defined by the model, cannot be minimized below a certain threshold by manipulating the model parameters in any way. If however, it is determined that the model is adequate but the signature is different from the expected, then a procedure is developed for determining which sub module is responsible for the difference (i.e. causes the system level specifications to be different from that specified by the behavioral model). Experiments on an RF transceiver are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed validation and diagnosis approach.	analogue electronics;behavioral modeling;computation;device under test;discrepancy function;excite;heuristic;iterative and incremental development;iterative method;mixed-signal integrated circuit;nonlinear system;radio frequency;simulation;transceiver;turing completeness;waveform	Sabyasachi Deyati;Aritra Banerjee;Barry John Muldrey;Abhijit Chatterjee	2013	2013 26th International Conference on VLSI Design and 2013 12th International Conference on Embedded Systems	10.1109/VLSID.2013.207	embedded system;electronic engineering;real-time computing;verification;computer science;engineering;reliability;post-silicon validation;fault detection and isolation;statistics	EDA	25.302987808196526	52.56753048454154	77477

In particular, some rather striking results of Lagrange are often recreated. For instance, in [6], a result pertaining to the Pell equation for a prime discriminant was recast in the light of nonabelian cohomology groups. Yet, in [1], the authors acknowledged the fact that the result “has been discovered before,” and provided an elementary proof of it and two other results related to Lagrange. In this paper, we present complete generalizations of these results (see Theorems 3.1, 3.5, and 3.9 below), and do so with only elementary properties of the simple continued fraction expansions of general √ D.

In particular a bound ofO~(n2.5) machine operations is presented for this computation assuming that the input matrix can be multiplied by a vector with constant-sized entries using O~(n) machine operations. Somewhat more general bounds for black-box matrix computations are also derived. Unfortunately, the correctness of this algorithm depends on the existence of efficient block projections of non-singular matrices, and this was only conjectured.  In this paper we establish the correctness of the algorithm from [10] by proving the existence of efficient block projections for arbitrary non-singular matrices over sufficiently large fields. We further demonstrate the usefulness of these projections by incorporating them into existing black-box matrix algorithms to derive improved bounds for the cost of several matrix problems. We consider, in particular, matrices that can be multiplied by a vector using O~(n) field operations: We show how to compute the inverse of any such non-singular matrix over any field using an expected number of O~(n2.27) operations in that field. A basis for the null space of such a matrix, and a certification of its rank, are obtained at the same cost. An application of this technique to Kaltofen and Villard's Baby-Steps/Giant-Steps algorithms for the determinant and Smith Form of an integer matrix is also sketched, yielding algorithms requiring O~(n2.66) machine operations. More general bounds involving the number of black-box matrix operations to be used are also obtained.  The derived algorithms are all probabilistic of the Las Vegas type. They are assumed to be able to generate random elements - bits or field elements - at unit cost, and always output the correct answer in the expected time given.	algorithm;average-case complexity;black box;computation;correctness (computer science);kernel (linear algebra);linear equation;sparse matrix;system of linear equations	Wayne Eberly;Mark Giesbrecht;Pascal Giorgi;Arne Storjohann;Gilles Villard	2007		10.1145/1277548.1277569	nilpotent matrix;matrix splitting;matrix analysis;mathematical optimization;gaussian elimination;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;eigendecomposition of a matrix;sparse matrix;nonnegative matrix;matrix multiplication;single-entry matrix;centrosymmetric matrix;generator matrix;linear algebra;band matrix;square matrix;mathematics;state-transition matrix;augmented matrix;matrix decomposition;matrix-free methods;block matrix;matrix;integer matrix;algebra	ML	48.12312286386876	40.89229840077521	77492

At the present stage, Analog circuit evolutionary design has achieved good results in passive filters and other analog circuits, but research on the evolution of the transistor level analog circuit is relatively small. In this paper, we designed a transistor level analog circuit evolutionary model by use of Differential Evolution algorithms combined with the circuit size(number of devices) adaptive strategy. The evolutionary model has a faster convergence rate, it has been able to evolve both circuit topologies, as well as component parameter. In the experimental part, we designed two experiments to validate the evolutionary model. The experimental results show that the evolutionary model can achieve transistor level analog circuit evolutionary design, and also solves the problem of the circuit size is difficult to estimate when the evolution of complex analog circuits.	algorithm;analogue electronics;continuous design;differential evolution;experiment;models of dna evolution;rate of convergence;spice;transistor	Qijian He;Jingsong He	2016	2016 9th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing, BioMedical Engineering and Informatics (CISP-BMEI)	10.1109/CISP-BMEI.2016.7852839	equivalent circuit;physical design;algorithm design;transistor model;convergence;analogue electronics;computer science;artificial intelligence;circuit extraction;transistor;encoding	EDA	26.78850853136511	48.645857423111956	77571

Let GB(G,H) be the reduced Gröbner basis of ideal hG,Hi, w.r.t. the elimination order for x. Let Ŝ be the lowest-order element of GB(G,H), and Ã, B ∈ K[x,u] be the cofactors of Ŝ: ÃG+ e BH = Ŝ. Let PRS(G,H) be the polynomial remainder sequence w.r.t. x, with initial polynomials G and H. Let Pk ∈ K[u] be the last element of PRS(G,H), and Ak,Bk ∈ K[x,u] be cofactors of Pk: AkG + BkH = Pk. Ak and Bk satisfy degree conditions: degx(Ak) < degx(H) and degx(Bk) < degx(G), while e Ã and B in general do not. Computing Â and B by reducing the degrees w.r.t. x, of Ã and B, respectively, and by normalizing Pk suitably, we show that (Pk,Ak,Bk) = c ( Ŝ, Â, B), where (P,A,B) denotes a tuple and c ∈ K. We then present a new method for solving the multivariate Diophantine equation ϕ G + ψH = F for given F ∈ K[x,u] and unknowns φ , ψ ∈ K(u)[x]. Furthermore, we show a new method for solving the ideal-membership problem for 〈G,H〉, without computing any Gröbner basis.	gröbner basis;normalization property (abstract rewriting);polynomial long division;polynomial remainder theorem;x86	Tateaki Sasaki;Daiju Inaba	2017	2017 19th International Symposium on Symbolic and Numeric Algorithms for Scientific Computing (SYNASC)	10.1109/SYNASC.2017.00019	tuple;discrete mathematics;diophantine equation;algebra;coprime integers;remainder;polynomial;gröbner basis;computer science;algebraic number field	Theory	45.727583857473526	37.75616122218628	77719

We translate a geometrically intuitive approach for two- and three-dimensional Euclidean space (R 2  and R3) into a new analytic method which is used to classify many Grassmannian frames in this setting, The method and associated algorithm decrease the maximum frame correlation, and hence give rise to the construction of specific examples of Grassmannian frames. Many of the results are known by other techniques, and even more generally, so that this paper can be viewed as tutorial. However, our analytic method is presented with the goal of developing it to address unresovled problems in d-dimensional Hilbert spaces which serve as a setting for spherical codes, erasure channel modeling, and other aspects of communications theory.

They are a generalisation of the de Bruijn sequences to two dimensions and are of practical significance in certain position location applications. In such applications the decoding problem, i.e. resolving the position of a particular sub-array within a specified Perfect Map, is of great significance. In this paper new constructions for (binary) Perfect Maps and 2k-ary de Bruijn sequences are presented. These construction methods, although not yielding Perfect Maps for new sets of parameters, are significant because the Maps they yield can be efficiently decoded.	code;de bruijn graph	Chris J.

Given an input of k symbols, our codes produce an unbounded number of output symbols, generating each parity independently by linearly combining a logarithmic number of randomly selected input symbols. The construction guarantees that for any ε>0 accessing a random subset of (1+ε)k encoded symbols, asymptotically suffices to recover the k input symbols with high probability. Our codes have the additional benefit of logarithmic locality: a single lost symbol can be repaired by accessing a subset of O(log k) of the remaining encoded symbols. This is a desired property for distributed storage systems where symbols are spread over a network of storage nodes. Beyond recovery upon loss, local reconstruction provides an efficient alternative for reading symbols that cannot be accessed directly. In our code, a logarithmic number of disjoint local groups is associated with each systematic symbol, allowing multiple parallel reads. Our main mathematical contribution involves analyzing the rank of sparse random matrices with specific structure over finite fields. We rely on establishing that a new family of sparse random bipartite graphs have perfect matchings with high probability.	clustered file system;code (cryptography);fountain code;locality of reference;matching (graph theory);parity bit;randomness;sparse matrix;with high probability	Megasthenis Asteris;Alexandros G.

It was proved that for any equidistant (n, M, d; q) code, d nM(q − 1)/(M − 1)q(= dopt, say). A necessary condition for the existence of an optimal equidistant code is that dopt be an integer. If dopt is not an integer, i.e. the equidistant code is not optimal, then the code with d = dopt is called good equidistant code, which is obviously the best possible one among equidistant codes with parameters n, M and q. In this paper, some constructions of good equidistant codes from balanced arrays and nested BIB designs are described. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The number of isomorphism classes of such designs is 1,054,163. Properties of the designs—including the orders of the automorphism groups and the structures of the derived Steiner triple systems of order 15—are tabulated. A double-counting consistency check is carried out to gain confidence in the correctness of the classification.	correctness (computer science);graph automorphism;quadruple-precision floating-point format;search algorithm;steiner tree problem	Petteri Kaski;Patric R.

The circuit uses a single latch and a voltage-controlled delay element. The circuit is evaluated in a stand-alone pad frame, where a jitter resolution of about 1 ps is demonstrated, and is incorporated in a 2 GHz clock distribution network to obtain on-chip period jitter and clock skew measurement.	clock network;clock rate;clock signal;clock skew;codel;delay line memory;physical design (electronics)	Keith A.

First, second and third order polynomial feedback terms are included in the cell and Heun's integration method is used. In order to reduce the cell count, the array is designed so that it can process input data that has been divided into blocks. The whole input data is stored in parallel with the cells so that all inpudoutput operations during processing are local. Cell structure is shown along with register connections between edge cells of the network. Analog power consumption and computing speed are estimated by HSPICE simulations using 0.25pm digital CMOS process parameters. The die area of a network with 2*72 cells with 36 layers in each is determined by drawing the layout.	artificial neural network;cmos;cellular neural network;die (integrated circuit);level design;mixed-signal integrated circuit;polynomial;spice 2;simulation	Mika Laiho;Ari Paasio;Asko Kananen;Kari Halonen	2002		10.1109/ISCAS.2002.1009917	control engineering;input/output;embedded system;electronic engineering;cellular neural network;computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system;cmos;polynomial;integrated circuit design	Visualization	53.4327604202749	52.98813454081741	78450

In this paper, we study the relations between those notions in the case of parametri c triangular systems.
