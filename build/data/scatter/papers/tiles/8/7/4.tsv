7e80e91e53c10354f809315c72a89e22661a5802	an imbedded initialization of newton's algorithm for matrix riccati equation	computational methods;riccati equation;newton s method;parameter imbedding;numerical methods	An effective numerical computation of the steady-state Riccati matrix is based on the successive solutions of a Lyapunov equation using Newton's method. The requirements of this algorithm are an initial stabilizing matrix and the numerical solution of the associated Lyapunov equation. Computationally, the first requirement is the more influencing factor in solving the Riccati equation with reasonable accuracy and speed. In this paper an initial matrix, based on the parameter imbedded solution of the Riccati equation, is introduced for the Newton's algorithm. The imbedding Newton algorithm has been applied to a variety of system, both stable and unstable as well as high-dimensional, A matrices, one of which is reported here. The proposed modification has improved the required CPU time of previous initialization schemes by as much as a factor of 6 times for the same order of accuracy.	algorithm;bellman equation;newton;newton's method	Mo M.

b900cde71f30cbb1038c024b788c77bbee513f31	a 2d nonlinear multiring model for blood flow in large elastic arteries	finite volume method;fluid structure interaction;reduced order model;two dimensional;blood flow	"""In this paper, we propose a two-dimensional nonlinear “multiring"""" model for blood flow in axisymmetric elastic arteries. It is designed to overcome the numerical difficulties of three-dimensional fluid-structure interaction simulations of blood flow without using the over-simplifications necessary to obtain one-dimensional models of blood flow. This multiring model is derived by integrating over concentric rings of fluid the simplified long-wave Navier-Stokes equations coupled to an elastic model of the arterial wall. The resulting system of balance laws provides a unified framework in which both the motion of the fluid and the displacement of the wall are dealt with simultaneously. The mathematical structure of the multiring model allows us to use a finite volume method that guarantees the conservation of mass and the positivity of the numerical solution and can deal with nonlinear flows and large deformations of the arterial wall. We show that the finite volume numerical solution of the multiring model provides at a reasonable computational cost an asymptotically valid description of blood flow velocity profiles and other averaged quantities (wall shear stress, flow rate, ...) in large elastic and quasi-rigid arteries. In particular, we validate the multiring model against well-known solutions such as the Womersley or the Poiseuille solutions as well as against steady boundary layer solutions in quasi-rigid constricted and expanded tubes."""	algorithmic efficiency;displacement mapping;finite volume method;mathematical structure;navier–stokes equations;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical partial differential equations;simulation;unified framework;velocity (software development)	Arthur R.

That work relied on the explicit knowledge of an accurate reduced model which is used to monitor the transfer of activity from the large to the small scales of the solution. Since this is not always available, we present in the current work a framework which shares the merits and basic idea of the previous approach but does not require an explicit knowledge of a reduced model. Moreover, the current framework can be applied for refinement in both random and physical space. In this manuscript we focus on the application to random space mesh refinement. We study examples of increasing difficulty (from ordinary to partial differential equations) which demonstrate the efficiency and versatility of our approach. We also provide some results from the application of the new framework to physical space mesh refinement.	adaptive mesh refinement;refinement (computing);unified framework	Jing Li;Panos Stinis	2016	J.

56ef68b6224420e9b2591f3fe54b12172ada20fa	a note on qr-based model reduction: algorithm, software, and gravitational wave applications		While the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is optimal under certain norms, its also expensive to compute. For large matrix sizes, the QR decomposition provides a tractable alternative. Under the assumption that it is a rank-revealing QR (RRQR), the approximation error incurred is similar to the POD error; furthermore, the authors show the existence of an RRQR with exactly the same error estimate as POD. To numerically realize an RRQR decomposition, they discuss the (iterative) modified Gram Schmidt with pivoting and reduced basis methods. They show that these two seemingly different approaches are equivalent. They then describe an MPI/OpenMP parallel code that implements one of the QR-based model reduction algorithms analyzed, and document the codes scalability for large problems, such as gravitational waves, and demonstrate excellent scalability up to 32,768 cores and, for complex dense matrices, as large as 10,000x3,276,800.

In such an algorithm, the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) component provides a solution to the hydrodynamic equations, whereas the Lagrangian Monte Carlo Probability Density Function (PDF) component solves for the PDF of chemical compositions. Special attention is paid to the transfer of specific volume information from the PDF to the LES code: the specific volume field contains probabilistic noise due to the nature of the Monte Carlo PDF solution, and thus the use of the specific volume field in the LES pressure solver needs careful treatment. Using a test flow based on the Sandia/Sydney Bluff Body Flame, we determine the optimal strategy for specific volume feedback. Then, the overall second-order convergence of the entire LES/PDF procedure is verified using a simple vortex ring test case, with special attention being given to bias errors due to the number of particles per LES finite volume (FV) cell.

Previous work has tackled this issue in the context of an overall algorithm for the simulation of turbulent reactive flows; the present work extends previous studies by examining the LES to PDF coupling error in detail, isolating it from other sources of numerical errors in an LES/PDF algorithm, and determining the optimal coupling strategy. A further original contribution of the present work is in the development of an LES/PDF coupling algorithm which allows for second-order accuracy of the overall code (with respect to both the grid size and time step); this second-order convergence is then verified numerically.

Due to indefiniteness of the submatrix corresponding to the velocities, these systems pose a serious challenge for iterative solution methods. In this paper, the augmented Lagrangian-based block triangular preconditioner introduced by the authors in [SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 28 (2006), pp. 2095–2113] is extended to this class of problems. We prove eigenvalue estimates for the velocity submatrix and deduce several representations of the Schur complement operator which are relevant to numerical properties of the augmented system. Numerical experiments on several model problems demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the preconditioner over a wide range of problem parameters.	augmented lagrangian method;experiment;iterative method;linear system;navier–stokes equations;numerical analysis;numerical method;preconditioner;regular expression;velocity (software development)	Maxim A.

Unlike Gauss-Seidel, it can be easily parallelized, which allows for the physics-based simulation of systems with millions of bodies. The proposed accelerated projected gradient descent (APGD) method relies on an approach by Nesterov in which a quadratic optimization problem with conic constraints is solved at each simulation time step to recover the normal and friction forces present in the system. The APGD method is validated against experimental data, compared in terms of speed of convergence and solution time with the Gauss-Seidel and Jacobi methods, and demonstrated in conjunction with snow modeling, bulldozer dynamics, and several benchmark tests that highlight the interplay between the friction and cohesion forces.	benchmark (computing);bulldozer (microarchitecture);gauss–seidel method;gradient descent;interaction;jacobi method;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;parallel computing;rate of convergence;simulation	Hammad Mazhar;Toby Heyn;Dan Negrut;Alessandro Tasora	2015	ACM Trans.

The NKS algorithm employs an inexact Newton method with backtracking (INB) as the nonlinear solver in conjunction with a Krylov subspace method as the linear solver for the corresponding Jacobian system. An overlapping Schwarz method as a preconditioner to accelerate the convergence of the linear solver. Two test cases including two isolated charged particles and two colloidal particles in a cylindrical pore are used as benchmark problems to validate the correctness of our parallel NKS-based PBE solver. In addition, a truly three- dimensional case, which models the interaction between two charged spherical particles within a rough charged micro-capillary, is simulated to demonstrate the applicability of our PBE solver to handle a problem with complex geometry. Finally, based on the result obtained from a PC cluster of parallel machines, we show numerically that NKS is quite suitable for the numerical simulation of interaction between colloidal particles, since NKS is robust in the sense that INB is able to converge within a small number of iterations regardless of the geometry, the mesh size, the number of processors. With help of an additive preconditioned Krylov subspace method NKS achieves parallel efficiency of 71% or better on up to a hundred processors for a 3D problem with 5 million unknowns.	algorithm;computer simulation;interaction;krylov subspace;langrisser schwarz;newton;numerical analysis;poisson–boltzmann equation	Feng-Nan Hwang;Shang-Rong Cai;Yun-Long Shao;Jong-Shinn Wu	2010	Computer Physics Communications	10.1016/j.cpc.2010.05.003	computer simulation;three-dimensional space;parallel processing;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;colloidal particle;nonlinear system;theoretical computer science;finite element method;mathematics;double layer;physics;quantum mechanics;charged particle;poisson–boltzmann equation	AI	93.15212510548183	7.2961827674747335	24849

This number takes integer values and can efficiently be computed as a surface integral on any closed hypersurface surrounding a given point. A nonzero value of the topological number indicates that in the corresponding point the gradient field vanishes, so the point is singular. The value of the topological number classifies the singularity and extends the notion of local minima and maxima in one-dimensional signals to the higher dimensional scalar images. Topological numbers are preserved along the drift of nondegenerate singular points induced by any smooth image deformation. When interactions such as annihilations, creations or scatter of singular points occurs upon a smooth image deformation, the total topological number remains the same. Our analysis based on an integral method and thus is a nonperturbative extension of the order-by-order approach using sets of differential invariants for studying singular points. Examples of typical singularities in one- and two-dimensional images are presented and their evolution induced by isotropic linear diffusion of the image is studied.	additive model;almquist shell;antivirus software;gaussian blur;gradient;hoc (programming language);identifier;image processing;image segmentation;interaction;internationalization and localization;maxima and minima;nonlinear system;scalar processor;scale space;superposition principle;technological singularity;topological quantum number;xfig	Stiliyan Kalitzin;Bart M. ter Haar Romeny;Alfons H.

The behavior of the cell populations is described by a system of delay partial differential equations with time-dependent coefficients. We construct the new algorithm by developing a time-splitting technique in which the entire problem is split into independent tasks assigned to arbitrary numbers of processors chosen in light of available resources. We present the results of a series of numerical experiments, which confirm the efficiency of the algorithm and exhibit a substantial decrease in computational time thus providing an effective means for fast clinical, case-by-case applications of tumor invasion simulations and possible treatment.	algorithm	Barbara Zubik-Kowal	2018	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2017.09.028	mathematical optimization;mathematics;differential equation;parallel algorithm;computer simulation;partial differential equation;algorithm	Logic	94.82035499951698	12.051731350598441	24965

In this article, we develop a highly accurate Chebyshev pseudo-spectral method (CPS4) to numerically study the stability of the rational solutions of the NLS equation. The scheme CPS4, using the map x=cotθx=cotθ and the FFT to approximate uxx, correctly handles the infinite line problem. A broad numerical investigation using CPS4 and involving large ensembles of perturbed initial data, indicates the Peregrine and second order rational solutions are linearly unstable.#R##N##R##N#Although standard Fourier integrators are often used in current studies of the NLS rational solutions, they do not handle solutions with discontinuous derivatives correctly. Using standard Fourier pseudo-spectral method (FPS4) for Peregrine initial data yields tiny Gibbs oscillations in the first steps of the numerical solution. These oscillations grow to O(1),O(1), providing further evidence of the instability of the Peregrine solution. To resolve the Gibbs oscillations we modify FPS4 using a spectral-splitting technique which significantly improves the numerical solution.	nonlinear system;schrödinger	Alvaro L. Islas;Constance M.

The geometry of the domain is described with subdivision surfaces and different resolutions of the same geometry are used for optimisation and analysis. The primal and adjoint problems are discretised with the boundary element method using a sufficiently fine control mesh. For shape optimisation the geometry is updated starting from the coarsest control mesh with increasingly finer control meshes. The multiresolution approach effectively prevents the appearance of non-physical geometry oscillations in the optimised shapes. Moreover, there is no need for mesh regeneration or smoothing during the optimisation due to the absence of a volume mesh. We present several numerical experiments and one industrial application to demonstrate the robustness and versatility of the developed approach.	boundary element method;computation;discretization;distortion;domain model;mathematical optimization;multigrid method;multiresolution analysis;polygon mesh;subdivision surface;volume mesh	Kosala Bandara;Fehmi Cirak;Günther Of;Olaf Steinbach;Jan Zapletal	2015	J.

Glaister, Conservative upwind difference schemes for the Euler equations, Comput. Math. Appl. 45 (2003) 1673-1682] a number of numerical schemes were presented for the Euler equations governing compressible flows of an ideal gas, the principal one of which is based on a conservative linearisation approach. This scheme was subsequently extended to encompass compressible flows of real gases where the equation of state allows for non-ideal gases [P. Glaister, Conservative upwind difference schemes for compressible flows of a real gas, Comput. Math. Appl. 48 (2004) 469-480]. These schemes use different parameter vectors in their construction and, consequently, the scheme in [P. Glaister, Conservative upwind difference schemes for compressible flows of a real gas, Comput. Math. Appl. 48 (2004) 469-480] when applied to the special case of an ideal gas is not identical to the principal ideal gas scheme in [P. Glaister, Conservative upwind difference schemes for the Euler equations, Comput. Math. Appl. 45 (2003) 1673-1682]. In this paper it is shown how these schemes are related, followed by a numerical comparison when each is applied to two standard test problems.	upwind scheme	P.

This paper establishes some sufficient conditions for parallel thinning algorithms working on hexagonal grids (or triangular lattices) to preserve topology.

Two challenges are encountered in the study, that is, to embed any type of prior information and to select its imposing schemes. The work focuses on the second challenge and studies a new constraint imposing scheme for equality constraints. A new method called locally imposing function (LIF) is proposed to provide a local correction to the GCNN prediction function, which therefore falls within Locally Imposing Scheme (LIS). In comparison, the conventional Lagrange multiplier method is considered as Globally Imposing Scheme (GIS) because its added constraint term exhibits a global impact to its objective function. Two advantages are gained from LIS over GIS. First, LIS enables constraints to fire locally and explicitly in the domain only where they need on the prediction function. Second, constraints can be implemented within a network setting directly. We attempt to interpret several constraint methods graphically from a viewpoint of the locality principle. Numerical examples confirm the advantages of the proposed method. In solving boundary value problems with Dirichlet and Neumann constraints, the GCNN model with LIF is possible to achieve an exact satisfaction of the constraints.	artificial neural network;geographic information system;lagrange multiplier;locality of reference;loss function;low insertion force;numerical method;optimization problem;principle of locality	Linlin Cao;Ran He;Bao-Gang Hu	2016	2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727830	mathematical optimization;artificial intelligence;machine learning;constraint	AI	86.90840500744379	16.77265306611041	25634

We note here that a very simple-to-implement fictitious point approach circumvents most of these difficulties. The new approach is tested on the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and on a dispersive linear PDE featuring a time-space corner singularity.	approximation;computation;dispersive partial differential equation;kuramoto model;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations;ps (unix);requirement;singularity project;spectral method;stepping level	Bengt Fornberg	2006	SIAM J.

The bidomain equation is discretized with the finite element method on a composite mesh composed of a fine voxel mesh around the heart and a coarse voxel mesh covering the torso. The extracellular potential problem on the torso is formulated as a variational problem with a constraint at the interface of the fine and coarse meshes. We show that this formulation naturally satisfies the conservation property of the electric currents and fits into the multilevel adaptive solution technique framework. We also present our special treatment of the Purkinje fiber network in the multigrid algorithm where it is modeled as multiway branching lines connected to the nodes in the voxel mesh of the heart. A parallel implementation of the proposed multigrid algorithm on distributed memory computers is presented and the performance is evaluated using real-life applications.

We prove this first for backward Euler schemes, and then extend the results to BDF2 schemes, and finally to schemes with outflow boundary conditions. Several numerical experiments are given which verify the convergence rate, and show how using projection methods in this setting with large grad-div stabilization parameters can dramatically improve accuracy.	approximation;converge;discretization;euler;experiment;finite element method;gradient;navier–stokes equations;numerical analysis;rate of convergence;span and div;the grid analysis and display system (grads);velocity (software development)	Alexander Linke;Michael Neilan;Leo G.

The numerical applications of this formulation have been limited by the difficulty to compute the Wasserstein distance in dimension 2. One step of the JKO scheme is equivalent to a variational problem on the space of convex functions, which involves the Monge-Ampère operator. Convexity constraints are notably difficult to handle numerically, but in our setting the internal energy plays the role of a barrier for these constraints. This enables us to introduce a consistent discretization, which inherits convexity properties of the continuous variational problem. We show the effectiveness of our approach on nonlinear diffusion and crowd-motion models.	calculus of variations;convex function;discretization;gradient;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;variational principle	Jean-David Benamou;Guillaume Carlier;Quentin Mérigot;Édouard Oudet	2016	Numerische Mathematik	10.1007/s00211-015-0781-y	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;calculus;mathematics	ML	87.41609839196127	15.256189350611757	26057
e35da1e07ec5fdf6baadfd7555936975d409c361	reliability analysis of subsea pipelines under spatially varying ground motions by using subset simulation		A computational framework is presented to calculate the reliability of subsea pipelines subjected to a random earthquake. This framework takes full account of the physical features of pipelines and the earthquake, and also retains high computing precision and efficiency. The pipeline and the seabed are modelled as a Timoshenko beam and a Winkler foundation, respectively, while the unilateral contact effect between them is considered. The random earthquake is described by its power spectrum density function and its spatial variation is considered. After suitable discretizations in the spatial domain by the finite element method and the time domain by the Newmark integration method, the dynamic unilateral contact problem is derived as a linear complementarity problem (LCP). Subset Simulation (SS), which is an advanced Monte Carlo simulation approach, is used to estimate the reliability of pipelines. By means of numerical examples, the accuracy and robustness of SS are demonstrated by comparing with the direct Monte Carlo simulation (DMCS). Then a sensitivity analysis of the reliability and a failure analysis are performed to identify the influential system parameters. Finally, failure probabilities of subsea pipelines are assessed for three typical cases, namely, with and without the unilateral contact effect, with different grades of spatial variations and with different free spans. The influences of these effects or parameters on the reliability are discussed qualitatively.	pipeline (computing);reliability engineering;subset simulation	Yuyin Li;Yahui Zhang;David Kennedy	2018	Rel.

72cf06bf90609485006f028d8f466ad8dc653536	a new matrix method for solving two-dimensional time-dependent diffusion equations with dirichlet boundary conditions		This paper is devoted to develop a new matrix scheme for solving two-dimensional timedependent diffusion equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We first transform these equations into equivalent integro partial differential equations (PDEs). Such these integro-PDEs contain both of the initial and boundary conditions and can be solved numerically in a more appropriate manner. Subsequently, all the existing known and unknown functions in the latter equations are approximated by Bernoulli polynomials and operational matrices of differentiation and integration together with the completeness of these polynomials can be used to reduce the integro-PDEs into the associated algebraic generalized Sylvester equations. For solving these algebraic equations, an efficient Krylov subspace iterative method (i.e., BICGSTAB) is implemented. Two numerical examples are given to demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy, and versatility of the proposed method. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

It has been observed numerically that the standard local error controls can impart desirable stability properties, but this has only been rigorously verified for very special, low-order, Runge-Kutta pairs. The rooted-tree expansion of a certain quadratic form, central to the stability theory of Runge-Kutta methods, is derived. This, together with key assumptions on the sequence of accepted timesteps and the local error estimate, provides a general explanation for the observed stability of such algorithms on dissipative problems. Under these assumptions, which are expected to hold for ‘typical’ numerical trajectories, two different results are proved. Firstly, for a large class of embedded Runge-Kutta pairs of order (1, 2), controlled on an error-per-unit-step basis, all such numerical trajectories will eventually enter a particular bounded set. This occurs for sufficiently small tolerances independent of the initial conditions. Secondly, for pairs of arbitrary orders (p − 1, p), operating under either error-per-step or error-per-unit-step control, similar results are obtained when an additional structural assumption (that should be valid for many cases of interest) is imposed on the dissipative vector field. Numerical results support both the analysis and the assumptions made.

In this paper, we present two improvements in such PGF-PDE approach, based on perturbation and double-truncation, respectively.The stiff system that involves fast and slow reactions together often requires high computational cost. By applying the perturbation method to PGF-PDEs, we expand the equation in terms of a small reaction rate which is often responsible for such stiffness of the system. Also by doubly truncating, we dump relatively small terms and reduce the computational load significantly at each time step. The terms corresponding to rare events are sieved out through truncations of Taylor expansion. It is shown through numerical examples of enzyme kinetics, transition model, and Brusselator model that the suggested method is accurate and efficient for approximation of the state probabilities.

This model is strongly coupled, highly nonlinear, and characterized by physical mechanisms that span a wide range of interacting time scales. Solutions of this system can include very fast component time scales to slowly varying dynamical time scales that are long relative to the normal modes of the model equations. Fully implicit time stepping is attractive for simulating this type of wide-ranging physical phenomena. However, it is essential that one has effective preconditioning strategies so that the overall fully implicit methodology is both efficient and scalable. In this paper, we propose and explore the performance of several candidate block preconditioners for this system. One of these preconditioners is based on an operator-split approximation. This method reduces the 3 × 3 system (momentum, continuity, and magnetics) into two 2 × 2 operators: a Navier–Stokes operator (momentum and continuity) and a magnetics-velocity operator (momentum and magnetics) which takes into account the critical Lorentz force coupling. Using previously developed preconditioners for Navier–Stokes, and an initial Schur-complement approximation for the magnetics-velocity system, we show that the split preconditioner is scalable and competitive with other preconditioners, including a fully coupled algebraic multigrid method.	applications-by-forms;approximation algorithm;courant–friedrichs–lewy condition;discretization;domain decomposition methods;dynamical system;elegant degradation;image scaling;interaction;jacobian matrix and determinant;linear algebra;multigrid method;navier–stokes equations;nonlinear system;normal mode;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations;preconditioner;run time (program lifecycle phase);scalability;scott continuity;simulation;solver;stepping level;surround sound;triangular matrix;velocity (software development)	Eric C.

Reduction the equation to a coupled system of real equations enables to approximate the space derivative terms by the proposed method. The resultant ordinary differential equation system is integrated with respect to the time variable by using various explicit methods of lower and higher orders. Some initial boundary value problems containing some analytical and non-analytical initial data are solved for experimental illustrations. The computational errors between the analytical and numerical solutions are measured by the discrete maximum error norm in case the analytical solutions exist. The two conserved quantities are calculated by using the numerical results in all cases. The matrix stability analysis is implemented to control the time step size.	cubic function;numerical analysis;schrödinger	Alper Korkmaz	2018	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2018.03.035	mathematics;mathematical analysis;mathematical optimization;sinc function;linearity;schrödinger equation;boundary value problem;ordinary differential equation;quadrature (mathematics);matrix (mathematics);conserved quantity	Robotics	89.93653484068923	11.815058375964755	26664

For the convergence in L^2, we show that the lowest order case p=1 is special in that the relative error in L^2 scales at best with k whereas it does not for higher order discretizations. An alternative to the Galerkin method with better dispersion properties is the optimally blended spectral-finite element scheme of Ainsworth and Wajid (2010). For this method, we present an error analysis in L^2 for the lowest order case p=1 in one dimension, showing that the L^2-error is improved by a factor k compared to the lowest order Galerkin FEM.

For polytropic perfect gas P ρ P0ρ , time asymptotically, it has been proved by Pan and Zhao 2009 that linear damping and slip boundary effect make the density satisfying the porous medium equation and the momentum obeying the classical Darcy’s law. In this paper, we use a more general method and extend this result to the 3D compressible Euler equations with nonlinear damping and a more general pressure term. Comparing with linear damping, nonlinear damping can be ignored under small initial data.	euler;navier–stokes equations;nonlinear system;obedience (human behavior)	Huimin Yu	2012	J.

9ad33b8d43a763fc926d0366b38f19f4c7436687	efficient second order unconditionally stable schemes for a phase field moving contact line model using an invariant energy quadratization approach		We consider the numerical approximations for a phase field model consisting of incompressible Navier--Stokes equations with a generalized Navier boundary condition, and the Cahn-Hilliard equation with a dynamic moving contact line boundary condition. A crucial and challenging issue for solving this model numerically is the time marching problem, due to the high order, nonlinear, and coupled properties of the system. We solve this issue by developing two linear, second order accurate, and energy stable schemes based on the projection method for the Navier--Stokes equations, the invariant energy quadratization for the nonlinear gradient terms in the bulk and boundary, and a subtle implicit-explicit treatment for the stress and convective terms. The well-posedness of the semidiscretized system and the unconditional energy stabilities are proved. Various numerical results based on a spectral-Galerkin spatial discretization are presented to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed schemes.	approximation;courant–friedrichs–lewy condition;discretization;galerkin method;gradient;navier–stokes equations;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations;well-posed problem;whole earth 'lectronic link	Xiaofeng Yang;Yaping Li	2018	SIAM J.

Existing LBE methods in graphics simulations are usually insufficient for turbulent flows since the collision term disturbs the underlying stability and accuracy. We adopt LBE with the multiple relaxation time (MRT) collision model (MRT-LBE), and address this issue by enhancing the collision-term modeling. First, we employ renormalization group analysis and formulate a new turbulence model with an adaptive correction method to compute more appropriate eddy viscosities on a uniform lattice structure. Efficient algebraic calculations are retained with small-scale turbulence details while maintaining the system stability. Second, we note that for MRT-LBE, predicting single eddy viscosity per lattice node may still result in instability. Hence, we simultaneously predict multiple eddy viscosities for stress-tensor-related elements, thereby asynchronously computing multiple relaxation parameters to further enhance the MRT-LBE stability. With these two new strategies, turbulent flows can be simulated with finer visual details even on coarse grid configurations. We demonstrate our results by simulating and visualizing various turbulent flows, particularly with smoke animations, where stable turbulent flows with high Reynolds numbers can be faithfully produced.	anatomic node;animation;computation (action);crystal structure;flow;graphics;grid computing;instability;lattice boltzmann methods;lattice corneal dystrophy type i;linear programming relaxation;medial rostrotemporal auditory cortex;multiple render targets;relaxation (approximation);simulation;smoke;turbulence modeling;viscosity;collision	Xiaopei Liu;Wai-Man Pang;Jing Qin;Chi-Wing Fu	2014	IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics	10.1109/TVCG.2012.303	turbulence;turbulence modeling;viscosity;lattice boltzmann methods;mathematical model;computational physics;computational model	Visualization	93.36603550233166	8.444104748277324	27547

The PDE, which is a nonlinear, fourth-order parabolic equation, is the L2 gradient flow of the energy ∫ Ω ( − 2 ln ( 1 + |∇φ|2 ) + 2 2 |∆φ(x)| 2 ) dx. The idea of convex-concave decomposition of the energy functional is applied, which results in a non-increasing energy property at the numerical level. The particular decomposition used here places the nonlinear term in the concave part of the energy, in contrast to a previous convexity splitting scheme. As a result, the numerical scheme is fully linear ∗Corresponding author, cwang1@umassd.edu	approximation;collocation;concave function;epitaxy;fast fourier transform;gradient;image scaling;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;parabolic antenna;theil–sen estimator	Wenbin Chen;Sidafa Conde;Cheng Wang;Xiaoming Wang;Steven M.

a410f0f89caa223590d9b3ba7937699bf2f4be41	numerical approximation schemes for multi-dimensional wave equations in asymmetric spaces		We develop finite difference numerical schemes for a model arising in multi-body structures, previously analyzed by H. Koch and E. Zuazua [13], constituted by two n-dimensional wave equations coupled with a (n− 1)-dimensional one along a flexible interface. That model, under suitable assumptions on the speed of propagation in each media, is well-posed in asymmetric spaces in which the regularity of solutions differs by one derivative from one medium to the other. Here we consider a flat interface and analyze this property at a discrete level, for finite difference and mixed finite element methods on regular meshes parallel to the interface. We prove that those methods are well-posed in such asymmetric spaces uniformly with respect to the mesh-size parameters and we prove the convergence of the numerical solutions towards the continuous ones in these spaces. In other words, these numerical methods that are well-behaved in standard energy spaces, preserve the convergence properties in these asymmetric spaces too. These results are illustrated by several numerical experiments.	approximation;experiment;finite difference;finite element method;hilbert space;koch snowflake;numerical method;software propagation;well-posed problem	Vincent Lescarret;Enrique Zuazua	2015	Math.

Three challenging dam-break flow problems are chosen to test the 2D meshless SWE model. The focus of this study is on the capability of simulating the shallow water flows with moving wet/dry fronts and large bottom slopes. Mass conservation, which is a very important concern in the wet/dry front problems, is carefully examined. Modification of the previous work on improving mass conservation is presented in this study. Computed results are compared with experimental data. The results show that the refined model can effectively simulate the flooding and drying with steep slopes in the topography.

In this article, a space-time conservation element and solution element (CESE) method is proposed for solving these equations in one and two space dimensions. The CESE method has capability to capture sharp propagating wavefront of the relativistic fluids without excessive numerical diffusion or spurious oscillations. In contrast to the existing upwind finite volume schemes, the Riemann solver and reconstruction procedure are not the building blocks of the suggested method. The method differs from previous techniques because of global and local flux conservation in a space-time domain without resorting to interpolation or extrapolation. The scheme is efficient, robust, and gives results comparable to those obtained with more sophisticated algorithms, even in highly relativistic two-dimensional test problems.

New results for the Laplace equation include an elementary proof of the inner-to-inner translation theorem, from which follows the definition of a far-field signature function analogous to that of the Helmholtz equation. The theory for the Helmholtz equation is developed in terms of a new convolutional form of the translation operator, which is connected to Rokhlin’s diagonal form by means of Wigner 3-j symbols.	translation studies	Michael A.

In the present approach, no a priori assumption is required regarding the functional form of the unknowns. This work can be physically associated with the detection of material non-homogeneities, such as inclusions, obstacles or cracks, in heat conduction, groundwater flow and tomography problems. Three versions of the conjugate gradient method are compared for the solution of the present inverse problem, by using simulated measurements containing random errors in the inverse analysis. Different functional forms, including those containing sharp corners and discontinuities, are used to generate the simulated measurements and to address the accuracy of the present solution approach. © 2004 IMACS.

The method borrows concepts from both the Discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) method by Demkowicz and Gopalakrishnan (2011) and the method of variational stabilization by Cohen, Dahmen, and Welper (2012), and it can also be interpreted as a variational multiscale method in which the fine-scales are defined through a dual-orthogonality condition. A key ingredient in the method is the proper choice of dual norm used to measure the residual, and we present two choices which are observed to be robust in both convection and diffusion-dominated regimes, as well as a proof of stability for quasi-uniform meshes and a method for the weak imposition of boundary conditions. Numerically obtained convergence rates in 2D are reported, and benchmark numerical examples are given to illustrate the behavior of the method.	finite element method;galerkin method	Jesse Chan;John A.

It can be regarded as one of the Petrov–Galerkin methods (see [Zhang yun-xin, Tan yong-ji, Solve PDEs using meshless Petrov–Galerkin Methods with RBFs, submitted for publication]), in which the test space is generated by the radial basis functions (RBFs), and the trial space is generated by some characteristic functions. But it is more efficient than the usual Petrov–Galerkin methods because the complicated integrals in the usual Petrov–Galerkin methods are replaced by the simple local boundary integrals. The numerical examples indicate it is really an accurate and efficient meshless method. Certainly our method also can be regarded as one of the weighted residual methods, or the generalization of the collocation methods.	meshfree methods	Yun-Xin Zhang;Yong-Ji Tan	2006	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2005.04.110	mathematical analysis;regularized meshless method;applied mathematics;numerical analysis;calculus;mathematics;geometry;algorithm;statistics	ML	83.71121369949961	13.94899307156126	29380

Classical numerical methods for solving this type of problems reveal disappointing behavior or are tremendously expensive in computer memory and processor time. This arises because the precision of an approximate solution depends inversely on perturbation parameter values and, thus, it deteriorates as a parameter decreases. Therefore, it is of particular interest to develop numerical methods whose error estimates would be independent of the perturbation parameter contaminating the solution. In order to overcome the said difficulty we derive robust parameter uniform error estimates for a class of partial functional differential equations. The analysis presented in this paper uses a suitable decomposition of the error into smooth and a singular component combined with the appropriate barrier functions and comparison principle.

We find this method works very well for the whole range of initial amplitudes. Excellent agreement of the approximate frequencies with the exact ones has been demonstrated and discussed. Only one iteration leads to high accuracy of the solutions with a maximal relative error for the approximate frequency of less than 0.60% for small and large values of oscillation amplitude, while this relative error is as low as 0.050% for the second iteration. Comparison of the results obtained using this method with those obtained by different harmonic balance methods reveals that the former is more effective and convenient for these types of nonlinear oscillators.	nonlinear system	Augusto Beléndez	2009	Computers & Mathematics with Applications	10.1016/j.camwa.2009.03.011	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;homotopy analysis method;homotopy perturbation method;calculus;mathematics	Robotics	83.53893646798545	16.00915635735583	29609

Further, it is shown that this extended Falkner–Skan equation can be reduced to the classical Falkner–Skan equation via a function transformation.

Finite element method (FEM) is applied to the resulting mesh to compute an approximate solution to the system of partial differential equations (PDE) representing the physical phenomena under study. Prior to FE analysis the Jacobian matrix determinant must be checked for all mesh elements. The value of this Jacobian depends on the configuration of the element nodes. If it is negative for a given node, the element is invalid and therefore the FE analysis cannot be carried out. Similarly, some elements, although valid, can present poor quality regarding Jacobian-based indicator values, such as the Jacobian ratio. Mesh registration procedures are likely to produce invalid and/or poor quality elements if the Jacobian parameter is ignored. To repair invalid and poor quality elements after mesh registration, we propose a relaxation procedure driven by specific validity and quality energy formulations derived from the Jacobian value. The algorithm first recovers mesh validity and further improves elements quality, focusing primarily on nodes that make the elements invalid or of poor quality. Our novel approach has been developed in the context of non-rigid mesh registration and validated on a data set of 60 clinical cases in the context of orthopaedic and orthognathic hard and soft tissues modelling studies. The proposed repair method achieves a valid state of the mesh and also raises the quality of the elements to a level suitable for commercial FE solvers.	approximation algorithm;finite element method;jacobian matrix and determinant;linear programming relaxation;numerical partial differential equations	Marek Bucki;Claudio Lobos;Yohan Payan;Nancy Hitschfeld-Kahler	2010	Engineering with Computers	10.1007/s00366-010-0198-2	jacobian matrix and determinant;mathematical optimization;quality management;simulation;finite element method;mathematics;engineering drawing;soft tissue;partial differential equation	Visualization	95.75293493524482	5.539977476883603	30364
a8a9d7e01ac65f7f878011f1760fc515a31f9764	asymptotic-preserving and positivity-preserving implicit-explicit schemes for the stiff bgk equation		We develop a family of second-order implicit-explicit (IMEX) schemes for the stiff BGK kinetic equation. The method is asymptotic-preserving (can capture the Euler limit without numerically resolving the small Knudsen number) as well as positivity-preserving — a feature that is not possessed by any of the existing second or high order IMEX schemes. The method is based on the usual IMEX Runge-Kutta framework plus a key correction step utilizing the special structure of the BGK operator. Formal analysis is presented to demonstrate the property of the method and is supported by various numerical results. Moreover, we show that the method satisfies an entropy-decay property when coupled with suitable spatial discretizations. Additionally, we discuss the generalization of the method to some hyperbolic relaxation system and provide a strategy to extend the method to third order.	asymptote;bhatnagar–gross–krook operator;euler;lagrangian relaxation;linear programming relaxation;numerical analysis;runge–kutta methods;stiff equation	Jingwei Hu;Ruiwen Shu;Xiangxiong Zhang	2018	SIAM J.

2db87c641138aca1d8e798c491158584179b38a5	application-driven model reduction for the simulation of therapeutic infusion processes in multi-component brain tissue		The present article concerns the problem-specific application of suitable model-reduction techniques to obtain an efficient numerical simulation of multi-component brain tissue. For this purpose, a compact summary of the underlying theoretical multi-component brain-tissue model is initially introduced in the framework of the Theory of Porous Media (TPM). Typically, the straight-forward monolithic solution of the arising coupled system of equations yields immense numerical costs. Therefore, the primary aim of this work is to apply the method of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) for a simplified model and the POD in combination with the discrete-empirical-interpolation method (DEIM) for a general nonlinear model in order to reduce the required computation time significantly. Several numerical simulations are realised and discussed in terms of efficiency, accuracy and parameter variations. In conclusion, the article presents necessary adaptations of the POD(-DEIM) allowing for their application to (nonlinear) strongly coupled and multi-component models.	simulation	D. Fink;A. Wagner;W.

The model was developed by decomposing the flow profile along the height of a microfluidic system into a Fourier series. It was validated against the analytical solution for flow in a straight rectangular channel and the full 3D numerical COMSOL Navier-Stokes solver for flow in a T-channel. Comparable accuracy to the full 3D numerical solution was achieved by using only three Fourier terms with a significant decrease in computation time. The quasi-3D model was used to model flows in a micro-flow cytometer chip on a desktop computer and good agreement between the simulation and the experimental results was found.	computation (action);desktop computer;intrauterine devices;microfluidics;navier–stokes equations;numerical analysis;numerical partial differential equations;simulation;solver;time complexity;automated flow cytometers	Md.

In particular, it is shown that if $k^{2p+1}h^{2p}$ is sufficiently small, then the pollution errors of both methods in $H^1$-norm are bounded by $O(k^{2p+1}h^{2p})$, which coincides with the phase error of the FEM obtained by existent dispersion analyses on Cartesian grids, where $h$ is the mesh size, and $p$ is the order of the approximation space and is fixed. The CIP-FEM extends the classical one by adding more penalty terms on jumps of higher (up to $p$th order) normal derivatives in order to reduce efficiently the pollution errors of higher order methods. Numerical tests are provided to verify the theoretical findings and to illustrate the great capability of the CIP-FEM in reducing the pollution effect.	finite element method	Yu Du;Haijun Wu	2015	SIAM J.

9db3b8279e8fc734f3a21acb79416e46a34a0ff3	convergence of vanishing capillarity approximations for scalar conservation laws with discontinuous fluxes		Flow of two phases in a heterogeneous porous medium is modeled by a scalar conservation law with a discontinuous coefficient. As solutions of conservation laws with discontinuous coefficients depend explicitly on the underlying small scale effects, we consider a model where the relevant small scale effect is dynamic capillary pressure. We prove that the limit of vanishing dynamic capillary pressure exists and is a weak solution of the corresponding scalar conservation law with discontinuous coefficient. A robust numerical scheme for approximating the resulting limit solutions is introduced. Numerical experiments show that the scheme is able to approximate interesting solution features such as propagating non-classical shock waves as well as discontinuous standing waves efficiently.	approximation algorithm;coefficient;experiment;numerical analysis	Giuseppe Maria Coclite;Lorenzo di Ruvo;Jan Ernest;Siddhartha Mishra	2013	NHM	10.3934/nhm.2013.8.969	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;calculus;mathematics	Robotics	89.8975907313015	10.0650441425046	31242
e708ece7edb8047a8ae0fa0335de9d825188d96a	application of the inverse fast multipole method as a preconditioner in a 3d helmholtz boundary element method	low rank compression;iterative solver;boundary element method;fast multipole method;preconditioning;inverse fast multipole method	We investigate an efficient preconditioning of iterative methods (such as GMRES) for solving dense linear systems    A  x = b      A  x  =  b        that follow from a boundary element method (BEM) for the 3D Helmholtz equation, focusing on the low-frequency regime. While matrix–vector products in GMRES can be accelerated through the low-frequency fast multipole method (LFFMM), the BEM often remains computationally expensive due to the large number of GMRES iterations. We propose the application of the inverse fast multipole method (IFMM) as a preconditioner to accelerate the convergence of GMRES. The IFMM is in essence an approximate direct solver that uses a multilevel hierarchical decomposition and low-rank approximations. The proposed IFMM-based preconditioning has a tunable parameter  e  that balances the cost to construct a preconditioner  M , which is an approximation of    A  −1        A    −  1         , and the cost to perform the iterative process by means of  M . Namely, using a small (respectively, large) value of  e  takes a long (respectively, short) time to construct  M , while the number of iterations can be small (respectively, large). A comprehensive set of numerical examples involving various boundary value problems with complicated geometries and mixed boundary conditions is presented to validate the efficiency of the proposed method. We show that the IFMM preconditioner (with a nearly optimal  e    of   10 −2        10    −  2         ) clearly outperforms some common preconditioners for the BEM, achieving 1.2–10.8 times speed-up of the computations, in particular when the scale of the underlying scatterer is about five wavelengths or more. In addition, the IFMM preconditioner is capable of solving complicated problems (in a reasonable amount of time) that BD preconditioner can not.	boundary element method;fast multipole method;preconditioner	Toru Takahashi;Pieter Coulier;Eric F Darve	2017	J.

The first biological system deals with the dynamics of phytoplankton–nutrient interaction under nutrient recycling and the second one deals with the modeling of whooping cough in the human population. Since both models requires positive solutions, the numerical solutions need to satisfy this property. In addition, it is necessary in some cases that numerical solutions reproduce correctly the dynamical behavior while in other cases it is necessary just to find the steady state.NSFD schemes can do this. In this paper Richardson’s extrapolation is applied directly to theNSFD solution to increase the order of accuracy of the numerical solutions of these biological systems. Numerical results show that Richardson’s extrapolation method improves accuracy. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

These models arise in the study of self-organisation in collective behavior modeling of animals and crowds. We adapt the method of convex integration to show the existence of infinitely many global-in-time weak solutions for any bounded initial data. Then we consider the class of dissipative solutions satisfying, in addition, the associated global energy balance (inequality). We identify a large set of initial data for which the problem admits infinitely many dissipative weak solutions.

(raffinement spatio-temporel par une approche de galerkin discontinue en élastodynamique pour le calcul haute performance)		This thesis studies local mesh refinement both in time and space for the second order elastodynamic equation in a high performance computing context. The objective is to develop numerical methods to treat small heterogeneities that have global impact on wave propagation. We use an internal penalty discontinuous Galerkin finite element approach for its flexibity and parallelization capabilities. The elasto-acoustic finite element formulation we discuss is elasto-acoustic in order to handle local acoustic heterogeneities. We also propose an optimized penalty term more suited to the elastodynamic equation that results in better CFL condition. We improve a second order PML formulation with an original time discretization that results in a more stable formulation. Using the p-adaptivity and nonconforming mesh capabilities of discontinuous Galerkin methods combined with a local time stepping method, we greatly reduce the high computational cost of local refinements. These methods have been implemented in C++, using template metaprogramming, in a distributed memory (MPI) and shared memory (OpenMP) parallel code. Finally, we show the potential of our methods on validation test cases and on more realistic test cases with medium including hydrofractures.	acceptance testing;acoustic cryptanalysis;adaptive mesh refinement;algorithmic efficiency;c++;computation;courant–friedrichs–lewy condition;discretization;distributed memory;finite element method;galerkin method;message passing interface;numerical method;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations;openmp;parallel computing;refinement (computing);shared memory;software propagation;stepping level;supercomputer;template metaprogramming;test case	Yohann Dudouit	2014				HPC	90.9019621129707	15.60461159679087	31906

We study and propose an efficient improvement on the existing Filon-type asymptotic methods, so that the improved Filon-type asymptotic methods can be able to numerically solving this class of multi-frequency highly oscillatory systems with a singular matrix  M . The improved Filon-type asymptotic methods are designed by combining Filon-type methods with the asymptotic methods based on the variation-of-constants formula.

d7f025839042d28f09410319ecf62b608d376377	range-separated tensor format for many-particle modeling		We introduce and analyze the new range-separated (RS) canonical/Tucker tensor format which aims for numerical modeling of the 3D long-range interaction potentials in multiparticle systems. The main idea of the RS tensor format is the independent grid-based low-rank representation of the localized and global parts in the target tensor, which allows the efficient numerical approximation of N -particle interaction potentials. The single-particle reference potential, described by the radial basis function p(‖x‖), x ∈ Rd, say p(‖x‖) = 1/‖x‖ for d = 3, is split into a sum of localized and long-range low-rank canonical tensors represented on a fine 3D n×n×n Cartesian grid. The smoothed long-range contribution to the total potential sum is represented on the 3D grid in O(n) storage via the low-rank canonical/Tucker tensor. We prove that the Tucker rank parameters depend only logarithmically on the number of particles N and the grid size n. Agglomeration of the short-range part in the sum is reduced to an independent treatment of N localized terms with almost disjoint effective supports, calculated in O(N) operations. Thus, the cumulated sum of shortrange clusters is parametrized by a single low-rank canonical reference tensor with local support, accomplished by a list of particle coordinates and their charges. The RS canonical/Tucker tensor representations defined on the fine n× n× n Cartesian grid reduce the cost of multilinear algebraic operations on the 3D potential sums, arising in modeling of the multidimensional data by radial basis functions. For instance, computation of the electrostatic potential of a large biomolecule and the interaction energy of a many-particle system, 3D integration and convolution transforms as well as low-parametric fitting of multidimensional scattered data all are reduced to 1D calculations.	asymptotically optimal algorithm;cartesian closed category;computation;convolution;data modeling;image scaling;interaction energy;linear algebra;low-rank approximation;matlab;many-body problem;numerical analysis;particle system;radial (radio);radial basis function;reed–solomon error correction;smoothing;tucker decomposition;type system;weight function	Peter Benner;Venera Khoromskaia;Boris N.

eebef53340adf6aa6daf9ff83c43609333ec6fee	a new gas-kinetic scheme based on analytical solutions of the bgk equation	3rd order weno reconstruction;analytical solution of bgk equation;gas kinetic scheme	Up to an arbitrary order of the Chapman–Enskog expansion of the kinetic Bhatnagar– Gross–Krook (BGK) equation, a corresponding analytic solution can be obtained. Based on such a compact exact solution, a new gas-kinetic scheme is constructed for the compressible Navier–Stokes equations. Instead of using a discontinuous initial condition in the gas-kinetic BGK–NS method Xu [K. Xu, A gas-kinetic BGK scheme for the Navier–Stokes equations, and its connection with artificial dissipation and Godunov method, J. Comput. Phys. 171 (2001) 289–335.], the new scheme starts with a continuous initial flow distribution at a cell interface which is obtained through an upwind-biased WENO reconstruction, and uses the time accurate solution for the flux evaluation. The new kinetic scheme not only preserves favorable properties of the existing BGK–NS method, such as stability, high resolution, and good performance in capturing discontinuity, but also achieves a very high efficiency, which is even more efficient than the same order well-defined classical finite difference scheme based on the macroscopic governing equations directly. The stability, accuracy, and efficiency of the new scheme are evaluated quantitatively through numerical tests. The new scheme captures sharp discontinuity without post-shock oscillation, and has high accuracy in resolving viscous solution. Due to the use of time-accurate analytical solution, the overall performance of the new scheme is superior in comparison with the finite difference or finite volume schemes which start from the same initial reconstruction and use the numerical Runge–Kutta methods for time accuracy. 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We discuss how such methods, typically formulated for time-independent surfaces, can be extended to calculate scattering from time-evolving ocean-like surfaces. Estimates are provided for the choice of parameters in such time-varying simulations. The method of ordered multiple interactions (MOMI) is used to calculate time-varying scattering from surfaces generated according to linear and nonlinear (Creamer) models for incidence angles ranging from normal to low grazing. We discuss the runtime considerations and demonstrate that combining the MOMI with a fast multipole method (FMM)-type acceleration technique makes large-scale time-varying Monte Carlo simulations possible. The average Doppler spectra of backscattered signals obtained from such simulations are compared for different incident angles, polarizations, and surface models. In particular, the simulations show a broadening of the Doppler spectra for nonlinear surfaces, especially at low grazing angles (LGA) and a separation of the vertical and horizontal polarization spectra at LGA for nonlinear surfaces. This spectral separation at LGA is not observed when the linear surfaces are used.	numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;randomness;simulation	Jakov V. Toporkov;Gary S. Brown	2000	IEEE Trans.

Problems of this type arise frequently in computational fluid dynamics and computational finance. We derive general conditions on the coefficients which allow us to obtain a high-order compact scheme which is fourth-order accurate in space and second-order accurate in time. Moreover, we perform a thorough von Neumann stability analysis of the Cauchy problem in two and three spatial dimensions for vanishing mixed derivative terms, and also give partial results for the general case. The results suggest unconditional stability of the scheme. As an application example we consider the pricing of European power put basket options in the multidimensional Black–Scholes model for two and three underlying assets. Due to the low regularity of typical initial conditions we employ the smoothing operators of Kreiss, Thomee, and Widlund [Comm. Pure Appl. Math., 23 (1970), pp. 241–259] to ensure high-order convergence of the approximations of the smoothed problem to the true solution.	approximation;black–scholes model;coefficient;computational finance;computational fluid dynamics;finite difference;initial condition;parabolic antenna;smoothing;von neumann stability analysis	Bertram Düring;Christof Heuer	2015	SIAM J.

We propose an analytical and numerical far-field-core decomposition that allows us to study existence and bifurcations of grain boundaries analytically and numerically using continuation techniques. This decomposition overcomes problems with computing grain boundaries in a large doubly periodic box with phase conditions. Using the spatially conserved quantities of the time-independent Swift-Hohenberg equation, we show that symmetric grain boundaries must select the marginally zig-zag stable stripes. We find that as the angle between the stripes is decreased, the symmetric grain boundary undergoes a parity-breaking pitchfork bifurcation where dislocations at the grain boundary split into disclination pairs. A plethora of asymmetric grain boundaries (with different angles of the far-field stripes either side of the boundary) is found and investigated. The energy of the grain boundaries is then mapped out. We find that when the angle between the stripes is greater than a critical angle, the symmetric grain boundary is energetically preferred while when the angle is less than the critical angle, the grain boundaries where stripes on one side are parallel to the interface are energetically preferred. Finally, we propose a classification of grain boundaries that allows us to predict various non-standard asymmetric grain boundaries.	bifurcation theory;continuation;numerical analysis;stripes;swift (programming language)	David J.

The numerical examples are presented and the results are compared with analytical solutions.

This result significantly improves previous work which requires β > 3 2 and brings us closer to the resolution of the well-known global regularity problem on the 2D MHD equations with standard Laplacian magnetic diffusion, namely, the case when β = 1.	computational magnetohydrodynamics;whole earth 'lectronic link	Chongsheng Cao;Jiahong Wu;Baoquan Yuan	2014	SIAM J.

One of them is the so-called projection method, in which the velocity field and the pressure field are solved separately. This method is very efficient, but is difficult to be extended to another multi-physics problem when an appropriate splitting is not available. The other approach is the fully coupled method in which the velocity and pressure fields stay together throughout the computation. The coupled approach can be easily extended to other multi-physics problems, but it requires the solution of some rather difficult linear and nonlinear algebraic systems of equations. The paper focuses on a fully coupled domain decomposition based parallel inexact Newton's method with subspace correction for incompressible Navier-Stokes equations at high Reynolds numbers. The discussion is restricted to the velocity-vorticity formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations, but the idea can be generalized to other multi-physics problems.	domain decomposition methods;navier–stokes equations;newton's method	Xiao-Chuan Cai;Xuefeng Li	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-01970-8_79	system of linear equations;independent equation;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;vector field;reynolds-averaged navier–stokes equations;pressure-correction method;calculus;mathematics;domain decomposition methods;projection method;euler equations	Vision	89.36495996767816	14.354578405782913	32805

An algorithm is introduced that utilizes the efficiency of low-order finite elements to precondition the high-order method in a multilevel setting. In particular, the efficacy of this approach is highlighted on simplexes in two and three dimensions with nodal spectral elements up to order n = 11. Additionally, a hybrid preconditioner is also developed for use with discontinuous spectral element methods. The latter approach is verified for the discontinuous Galerkin method on elliptic problems.	amg lasso;algebraic riccati equation;algorithm;authorization;computation;computational complexity theory;delaunay triangulation;discontinuous galerkin method;discretization;finite element method;linear algebra;linear system;multigrid method;precondition;preconditioner;scalability;solver	Luke N.

In addition the numerical method is shown to accurately describe the void regions encountered in the forward modeling of real-life specimens such as infant brains. The accuracy of the method is demonstrated over three model problems where the PN approximation is compared against Monte Carlo simulations and other state-of-the-art methods.	finite element method	P.

The domains are represented by overlapping structured grids, and block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is employed to locally increase the grid resolution. In addition, the numerical method is implemented on parallel distributed-memory computers using a domain-decomposition approach. The implementation is flexible so that each base grid within the overlapping grid structure and its associated refinement grids can be independently partitioned over a chosen set of processors. A modified bin-packing algorithm is used to specify the partition for each grid so that the computational work is evenly distributed amongst the processors. All components of the AMR algorithm such as error estimation, regridding, and interpolation are performed in parallel. The parallel time-stepping algorithm is illustrated for initial-boundary-value problems involving a linear advection– diffusion equation and the (nonlinear) reactive Euler equations. Numerical results are presented for both equations to demonstrate the accuracy and correctness of the parallel approach. Exact solutions of the advection–diffusion equation are constructed, and these are used to check the corresponding numerical solutions for a variety of tests involving different overlapping grids, different numbers of refinement levels and refinement ratios, and different numbers of processors. The problem of planar shock diffraction by a sphere is considered as an illustration of the numerical approach for the Euler equations, and a problem involving the initiation of a detonation from a hot spot in a T-shaped pipe is considered to demonstrate the numerical approach for the reactive case. For both problems, the accuracy of the numerical solutions is assessed quantitatively through an estimation of the errors from a grid convergence study. The parallel performance of the approach is examined for the shock diffraction problem. 2008 Elsevier Inc.

In this representation, the initial value problem is solved by applying the fundamental solution exp(−itH) to the initial field configuration. The Faber polynomial approximation of the fundamental solution is used to develop a numerical algorithm for propagation of broad band wave packets in passive media. The action of the Hamiltonian on the wave function Ψ is approximated by the Fourier grid pseudospectral method. The algorithm is global in time, meaning that the entire propagation can be carried out in just a few time steps. A typical time step is much larger than that in finite differencing schemes, ∆tF ≫ ‖H‖−1. The accuracy and stability of the algorithm is analyzed. The Faber propagation method is compared with the Lanczos-Arnoldi propagation method with an example of scattering of broad band laser pulses on a periodic grating made of a dielectric whose dispersive properties are described by the Rocard-Powels-Debye model. The Faber algorithm is shown to be more efficient. The Courant limit for time stepping, ∆tC ∼ ‖H‖−1, is exceeded at least in 3000 times in the Faber propagation scheme. email: borisov@lcam.u-psud.fr email: shabanov@phys.ufl.edu	apache axis;approximation algorithm;arnoldi iteration;autoregressive integrated moving average;benchmark (computing);computation;courant–friedrichs–lewy condition;dispersive partial differential equation;email;faber polynomials;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);imaginary time;leapfrog integration;lossless compression;mathematical optimization;maxwell (microarchitecture);numerical analysis;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations;perturbation theory;polynomial;pseudo-spectral method;quantum mechanics;recurrence relation;recursion;reduction (complexity);resonance;schrödinger;software propagation;stepping level;time complexity;upwind scheme;wave packet	Andrei G.

The method uses a finite difference approximation in one coordinate space. Similar to the method of line, the method treats the working equation as a system of ordinary differential equation in the remaining independent variable. The method uses a coordinate transformation to decouple the system of ODE. Using this procedure, it is possible to formulate numerical schemes with arbitrary orders of accuracy.

We employ matrix-free Newton-Krylov solvers and perform numerical continuation of localised patterns directly on the integral form of the equation. This opens up the possibility to study systems whose synaptic kernel does not lead to an equivalent PDE formulation. We present a numerical bifurcation study of localised states and show that the proposed models support patterns of activity with varying spatial extent through the mechanism of homoclinic snaking. The regular organisation of these patterns is due to spatial interactions at a specific scale associated with the separation of excitation peaks in the chosen connectivity function. The results presented form a basis for the general study of localised cortical activity with inputs and, more specifically, for investigating the localised spread of orientation selective activity that has been observed in the primary visual cortex with local visual input.	aharonov–bohm effect;approximation;bifurcation theory;coherent;control theory;convolution;density functional theory;feature vector;futures studies;generalized minimal residual method;in-phase and quadrature components;interaction;krylov subspace;lattice qcd;newton;newton's method;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical continuation;persistence (computer science);quasiperiodicity;swift (programming language);synaptic package manager	James Rankin;Daniele Avitabile;Javier Baladron;Grégory Faye;David J.

Fractional calculus is applied to describe the phenomenon of subdiffusion of oxygen in both transverse and longitudinal directions. A new iterative method (NIM) and a modified Adomian decomposition method (MDM) are used to solve the multi-term fractional diffusion equation for different conditions. The results thus obtained are compared and presented graphically. It is observed that the order of the diffusion equation affects the delivery of oxygen significantly.		V. Srivastava;K. N.

The integrand of the Pearcey integral oscillates wildly in this region and the asymptotic saddle point analysis is complicated. Then we consider here the modified saddle point method introduced in [Lopez, Pérez and Pagola, 2009] [4]. With this method, the analysis is simpler and it is possible to derive a complete asymptotic expansion of P(x, y) for large |y|. The asymptotic analysis requires the study of three different regions for arg y separately. In the three regions, the expansion is given in terms of inverse powers of y and the coefficients are elementary functions of x. The accuracy of the approximation is illustrated with some numerical experiments. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Eldredge, Co-chair The effects of surface roughness on the stability of hypersonic flow are of great importance to hypersonic vehicles. Surface roughness can greatly alter boundary-layer flow and cause transition to turbulence to occur much earlier compared to a smooth wall, which will result in a significant increase of wall heating and skin friction drag. The work presented in this dissertation was motivated by a desire to study the effects of isolated roughness elements on the stability of hypersonic boundary layers. A new code was developed which can perform high-order direct numerical simulations of high-speed flows over arbitrary geometries. A fifth-order hybrid weighted essentially non-oscillatory scheme was implemented to capture any steep gradients in the flow created by the geometries. The simulations are carried out on Cartesian grids with the geometries imposed by a third-order cut-cell method. A multizone refinement method is also implemented to provide extra resolution at locations with expected complex physics. The combination results in a globally fourth-order scheme. Results for two-dimensional and three-dimensional test cases show good agreement with previous results and will be presented. Results confirming the code’s high order of convergence will also be shown. Two-dimensional simulations of flow over complex geometries will be presented to demonstrate the code’s capabilities. Results for Mach 6 flow over a threedimensional cylindrical roughness element will also be presented. The results will show that ii the code is a promising tool for the study of hypersonic roughness-induced transition.		Patrick T. Greene;Jeff D. Eldredge;Xiaolin Zhong;John Kim	2016	J. Comput.

Active shielding is achieved by constructing additional (secondary) sources in such a way that the total contribution of all sources leads to the desirable effect. The problem is formulated as an inverse source problem with the secondary sources positioned outside the domain to be shielded. Along with the undesirable field (noise) to be shielded the presence of a desirable component (‘‘friendly’’ sound) is accepted in the analysis. The constructed solution of the problem requires only the knowledge of the total field (noise) on the perimeter of the shielded domain. Some important aspects of the problem are addressed in the paper for the first time, such as the non-stationary formulation of the problem, existence of the resonance regimes and sensitivity of the solution to the input errors. The obtained solution is applicable to aeroacoustics problems. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	perimeter;resonance;secondary source;stationary process	Sergei V. Utyuzhnikov	2010	J.

The conditions generalize those we constructed earlier for the isotropic wave equation. As in the well-known work of Bayliss and Turkel, the construction is based on the progressive wave (or multipole) expansion of outgoing solutions. Using auxiliary functions defined only on the artificial boundary, problems associated with the use of high-order derivatives, as in the original Bayliss-Turkel formulation, are avoided. The order of the conditions is thus increased simply by using more auxiliary variables. By generalizing to the convective case, we have developed conditions which can be used in aeroacoustics applications whenever the Euler equations linearized about a uniform flow are sufficiently accurate in the far field. Numerical experiments in two space dimensions are presented to illustrate the stability and accuracy of the proposed technique.	eli turkel;euler;experiment;numerical method;software propagation;subsonic;whole earth 'lectronic link	Thomas Hagstrom;S.

23a14ba2bfd2ae218192c729321d20af4d808ec9	superconvergence of kernel-based interpolation		From spline theory it is well-known that univariate cubic spline interpolation, if carried out in its natural Hilbert space W 2 2 [a, b] and on point sets with fill distance h, converges only like O(h) in L2[a, b] if no additional assumptions are made. But superconvergence up to order h occurs if more smoothness is assumed and if certain additional boundary conditions are satisfied. This phenomenon was generalized in 1999 to multivariate interpolation in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces on domains Ω ⊂ R for continuous positive definite Fourier-transformable shift-invariant kernels on R. But the sufficient condition for superconvergence given in 1999 still needs further analysis, because the interplay between smoothness and boundary conditions is not clear at all. Furthermore, if only additional smoothness is assumed, superconvergence is numerically observed in the interior of the domain, but without explanation, so far. This paper first generalizes the “improved error bounds” of 1999 by an abstract theory that includes the Aubin-Nitsche trick and the known superconvergence results for univariate polynomial splines. Then the paper analyzes what is behind the sufficient conditions for superconvergence. They split into conditions on smoothness and localization, and these are investigated independently. If sufficient smoothness is present, but no additional localization conditions are assumed, it is proven that superconvergence always occurs in the interior of the domain. If smoothness and localization interact in the kernel-based case on Email address: schaback@math.uni-goettingen.de (Robert Schaback) URL: http://num.math.uni-goettingen.de/schaback (Robert Schaback) Preprint submitted to Elsevier July 20, 2016 R, weak and strong boundary conditions in terms of pseudodifferential operators occur. A special section on Mercer expansions is added, because Mercer eigenfunctions always satisfy the sufficient conditions for superconvergence.

The resulting stiffness matrices have the structure of saddle point problems with a penalty term, which is associated with the Poisson ratio for elasticity problems or with stabilization techniques for Stokes problems. The main results of this paper show that the convergence rate of the resulting algorithms is independent of the penalty parameter, the number of spectral elements N and mildly depend.ant on the spectral degree n via the inf-sup constant. The preconditioners proposed for the whole indefinite system are block-diagonal and block-triangular. Numerical experiments presented in the final section show that these algorithms are a practical and efficient strategy for the iterative solution of the indefinite problems arising from mixed spectral element discretizations of elliptic systems. *This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant NSF-CCR-9503408 and by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration under NASA Contract No. NAS1-19480 while the author was in residence at the Institute for Computer Applications in Science and Engineering (ICASE), NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA 23681-0001.	algorithm;conjugate residual method;direct stiffness method;discretization;domain decomposition methods;elasticity (cloud computing);elasticity (data store);experiment;generalized minimal residual method;ibm notes;iterative method;krylov subspace;mass matrix;multigrid method;navier–stokes equations;numerical analysis;preconditioner;rate of convergence;sparse matrix;spectral method	Luca F.

In this work, we prove that the global attractor of the 3D NSV equations, driven by an analytic forcing, consists of analytic functions. A consequence of this result is that the spectrum of the solutions of the 3D NSV system, lying on the global attractor, have exponentially decaying tail, despite the fact that the equations behave like a damped hyperbolic system, rather than the parabolic one. This result provides additional evidence that the 3D NSV with the small regularization parameter enjoys similar statistical properties as the 3D Navier–Stokes equations.

We analyze two 3D-0D coupling approaches in which a fractional-step projection scheme is used in the fluid. Our analysis shows that explicit approaches might yield numerical instabilities, particularly in the case of realistic geometries with multiple outlets. We introduce and analyze an implicitly 3D-0D coupled formulation with enhanced stability properties and which requires a negligible additional computational cost.

Dans cet article nous analysons deux approches pour le couplage de modèles 3D-0D, dans lesquelles un schéma à pas fractionnaire est utilisé dans le fluide. Notre analyse met en évidence que les schémas de couplage 3D-0D explicites peuvent donner des instabilités numériques dans le cas de sorties multiples. Nous introduisons et analysons une formulation 3D-0D implicite avec des propriétés de stabilité améliorées et un coût de calcul supplémentaire négligeable par rapport au cas explicite.

90f102492dd6cd4cc9b98ab101029378087183a5	a new 3d-2d interior error estimate independent on the geometry of a linear elastic plate		Abstract We study how three-dimensional linearized elasticity for thin plates can be approximated by a two-dimensional projection. The classical approach using formal asymptotic expansions in powers of the thickness in the Hellinger-Reissner formulation, only provides error estimates in the H1 norm for the displacements, assuming at least L2 regularity for the applied forces, plus additional regularity for some components. Here we make use of elliptic regularity theory. We prove a 3d-2d interior error estimate between the 3d displacement solution and its 2d projection. Moreover the constants involved in our estimate are independent on the particular geometry of the plate. Our approach yields an H2 error estimate, assuming only L2 regularity for the applied forces, which is optimal from the point of view of elliptic regularity theory. We also obtain interior W k,p and C error estimates.	approximation algorithm;displacement mapping;elasticity (data store);thickness (graph theory)	Régis Monneau	2006	Asymptotic Analysis		mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;mathematics;geometry	Theory	88.70119090735267	11.60652286634594	34718

We apply an optimal non-uniform method to discretize the angular space and an upwind type finite-difference method to discretize the spatial space. A Gauss-Seidel iterative method is then applied to solve the fully discretized system of linear equations. Finally, we extend the resulting radiance in two-dimensional to three-dimensional by the azimuthal symmetric assumption to compute the received optical power under the given receiver aperture and field of view. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed scheme are validated by uniform RTE solver and Monte Carlo simulations.	angularjs;discretization;finite difference method;gauss–seidel method;iterative method;linear equation;monte carlo method;numerical analysis;numerical partial differential equations;optical wireless;simulation;software propagation;solver;steady state;system of linear equations	Changping Li;Ki-Hong Park;Mohamed-Slim Alouini	2015	IEEE Wireless Communications Letters	10.1109/LWC.2015.2459697	radiative transfer;mathematical optimization;mathematical model;mathematics;accuracy and precision;light scattering;wireless;statistics	Vision	91.40835034442738	6.974820612474911	34781

The obtained solutions for the velocity field and shear stress, written in terms of generalized G functions, are presented as sum of the similar Newtonian solutions and the corresponding non-Newtonian contributions. The non-Newtonian contributions, as expected, tend to zero for λ → 0. Furthermore, the solutions for ordinary Maxwell fluid, performing the same motion, are obtained as limiting cases of general solutions and verified by comparison with previously known results. Finally, the influence of the material and the fractional parameters on the fluid motion, as well as a comparison among fractional Maxwell, ordinary Maxwell and Newtonian fluids is also analyzed by graphical illustrations. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The model assumes quasi-neutrality and is fully electromagnetic. The implicit field solver improves numerical accuracy by separating the equilibrium terms in the presence of small perturbations. The equilibrium part of the generalized Ohm’s law is solved by direct matrix inversion along the direction of gradients for every Fourier mode in the other two directions, while the nonlinear part is solved iteratively. The simulation has been benchmarked on Alfvén waves, ion sound waves and whistler waves against analytical dispersion relation in a slab. In particular, the first-order and second-order schemes are compared by studying the numerical damping of whistler waves. The full evolution of the resistive tearing mode using the Harris sheet equilibrium is also investigated. The linear growth rate and mode structure are compared with the resistive MHD theory. Important tearing mode nonlinear phenomena such as the Rutherford regime and saturation are demonstrated. We also presented systematic study of Rutherford growth rates and saturation island width, which is consistent with previous MHD studies.

High order spatial accuracy is obtained through a WENO reconstruction, while a high order one-step time discretization is achieved using a local space-time discontinuous Galerkin predictor method. Due to the one-step nature of the underlying scheme, the resulting algorithm is particularly well suited for an AMR strategy on space-time adaptive meshes, i.e.with time-accurate local time stepping. The AMR property has been implemented ’cell-by-cell’, with a standard tree-type algorithm, while the scheme has been parallelized via the Message Passing Interface (MPI) paradigm. The new scheme has been tested over a wide range of examples for nonlinear systems of hyperbolic conservation laws, including the classical Euler equations of compressible gas dynamics and the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). High order in space and time have been confirmed via a numerical convergence study and a detailed analysis of the computational speed-up with respect to highly refined uniform meshes is also presented. We also show test problems where the presented high order AMR scheme behaves clearly better than traditional second order AMR methods. The proposed scheme that combines for the first time high order ADER methods with space–time adaptive grids in two and three space dimensions is likely to become a useful tool in several fields of computational physics, applied mathematics and mechanics.	adaptive multi-rate audio codec;adaptive filter;adaptive mesh refinement;algorithm;computation;computational astrophysics;computational physics;discretization;euler;finite volume method;galerkin method;kerrison predictor;message passing interface;method of lines;navier–stokes equations;newton's method;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations;overhead (computing);parallel computing;programming paradigm;rate of convergence;runge–kutta methods;simulation;stepping level;turbulence;vortex	Michael Dumbser;Olindo Zanotti;Arturo Hidalgo;Dinshaw S.

5d801a2dfcb17e499288308064dd0dc453507de7	a high order method for the approximation of integrals over implicitly defined hypersurfaces		We introduce a novel method to compute approximations of integrals over implicitly defined hypersurfaces. The new method is based on a weak formulation in L2(0, 1), that uses the coarea formula to circumvent an explicit integration over the hypersurfaces. As such it is possible to use standard quadrature rules in the spirit of hp/spectral finite element methods, and the expensive computation of explicit hypersurface parametrizations is avoided. We derive error estimates showing that high order convergence can be achieved provided the integrand and the hypersurface defining function are sufficiently smooth. The theoretical results are supplemented by numerical experiments including an application for plasma modeling in nuclear fusion.	approximation;computation;experiment;finite element method;numerical analysis;numerical integration;plasma active;weak formulation	Lukas Drescher;Holger Heumann;Kersten Schmidt	2017	SIAM J.

However, the generation of curved meshes remains a computationally expensive endeavor with current meshing approaches: high-order parametric elements are notoriously difficult to conform to a given boundary geometry, and enforcing a smooth and non-degenerate Jacobian everywhere brings additional numerical difficulties to the meshing of complex domains. In this paper, we propose an extension of Optimal Delaunay Triangulations (ODT) to curved and graded isotropic meshes. By exploiting a continuum mechanics interpretation of ODT instead of the usual approximation theoretical foundations, we formulate a very robust geometry and topology optimization of Bézier meshes based on a new simple functional promoting isotropic and uniform Jacobians throughout the domain. We demonstrate that our resulting curved meshes can adapt to complex domains with high precision even for a small count of elements thanks to the added flexibility afforded by more control points and higher order basis functions.

7c760bfa780ba2eadd04188999549d10a2ed0638	stochastic quasilinear viscoelastic wave equation with degenerate damping and source terms		The goal of this study is to investigate an initial boundary value problem for the stochastic quasilinear viscoelastic wave equation involving the nonlinear damping (vert u_{t} vert ^{q-2} u_{t}) and a source term of the type (vert u vert ^{p-2}u) driven by additive noise. By an appropriate energy inequality, we prove that finite time blow-up is possible for equation (1.1) below if (p u003e {q, rho +2 }) and the initial data are large enough (that is, if the initial energy is sufficiently negative). Also, we show that if (q geq p), the local solution can be extended for all time and is thus global.

One such example is a flow wherein the range of pressures involved is very large and high pressures and pressure gradients are at play. Here, after developing an approximation for the flow through a porous solid, that is a generalization of an equation developed by Brinkman, we study a simple boundary value problem that clearly delineates the difference between the solution to these equations and those due to the equations that are referred to as “Darcy Law”. We find that the solutions for the equations under consideration exhibit markedly different characteristics from the counterpart for the Brinkman equations or Darcy’s equations (or the Navier–Stokes equation if one neglects the porosity) in that the  solutions for the velocity as well as the vorticity lack symmetry  and one finds the maximum value of the vorticity occurs at the boundary near which the fluid is less viscous in virtue of the pressure being lower. We also find that for a certain range of values for the non-dimensional parameters describing the flow, boundary layers develop in that the vorticity is confined next to the boundary adjacent to which the viscosity is lower, such boundary layers being absent in the other classical cases.	gradient	K.

These measurements are generated by a single point source of electric pulses and are collected using a microwave scattering facility which was built at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Our imaging problem is formulated as the inverse problem of the reconstruction of the spatially distributed dielectric permittivity εr (x) , x ∈ R, which is an unknown coefficient in Maxwell’s equations. On the first stage an approximately globally convergent method is applied to get a good first approximation for the exact solution. On the second stage a local adaptive finite element method is applied to refine the solution obtained on the first stage. The two-stage numerical procedure results in accurate imaging of all three components of interest of targets: shapes, locations and refractive indices. In this paper we briefly describe methods and present new reconstruction results for both stages.	coefficient;emoticon;finite element method;iteration;local convergence;maxwell (microarchitecture);microwave;numerical analysis;numerical method;order of approximation;radar;super-resolution imaging	Larisa Beilina;Nguyen Trung Thành;Michael V.

467f6c4b3f8ea47b04e398b1e3bc0140ba505a6b	probabilistic meshless methods for partial differential equations and bayesian inverse problems		This paper develops a class of meshless methods that are well-suited to statistical inverse problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs). The methods discussed in this paper view the forcing term in the PDE as a random field that induces a probability distribution over the residual error of a symmetric collocation method. This construction enables the solution of challenging inverse problems while accounting, in a rigorous way, for the impact of the discretisation of the forward problem. In particular, this confers robustness to failure of meshless methods, with statistical inferences driven to be more conservative in the presence of significant solver error. In addition, (i) a principled learning-theoretic approach to minimise the impact of solver error is developed, and (ii) the challenging setting of inverse problems with a non-linear forward model is considered. The method is applied to parameter inference problems in which non-negligible solver error must be accounted for in order to draw valid statistical conclusions.	collocation method;discretization;meshfree methods;nonlinear system;numerical partial differential equations;solver;theory	Jon Cockayne;Chris J.

The method we employ combines a finite element space approximation with a time discretization by operator-splitting. To solve the Cahn–Hilliard part of the problem, we use a least-squares/conjugate gradient method. We also show that the scheme has the total energy decaying in time property under certain conditions. Our numerical experiments indicate that the method discussed here is accurate, stable and efficient. Describing accurately an immiscible two-phase flow in the vicinity of the contact line, where the fluid–fluid interface intersects the solid wall, is a classical and challenging problem in hydrodynamics. In the past two decades, it has been shown through Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations that, indeed, a near complete slip does occur at the moving contact line (MCL) [16,17,27,26]. Through the analysis of extensive MD data, it was recently discovered that there is indeed a differential boundary condition, denoted the generalized Navier boundary condition (GNBC), which resolves the MCL problem [19]. In [19], one gives a continuum formulation of the immiscible flow hydrodynamics, including the GNBC, the Navier–Stokes equations, and the Cahn–Hilliard interfacial free energy. It is shown that the numerical results based on the GNBC can reproduce quantitatively the results from the MD simulation. This indicates that the new model can accurately describe the behavior near the contact line. The model has also been used to study several problems involving moving contact line [4,20,28]. A numerical method for the solution of the above coupled system is discussed in [19]; it relies on a standard explicit finite difference scheme whose stability requires a quite demanding limitation of the time step because of the high (fourth) order	apache continuum;approximation;archive;conjugate gradient method;courant–friedrichs–lewy condition;discretization;experiment;finite difference method;finite element method;least squares;macintosh common lisp;microsoft word for mac;molecular dynamics;navier–stokes equations;numerical method;numerical partial differential equations;personal web page;simulation;systems modeling;two-phase locking	Qiaolin He;Roland Glowinski;Xiaoping Wang	2011	J.

The method uses deferred correction, such that high-order accuracy is obtained by solving a sequence of systems with a narrow stencil on the left-hand side. These systems are solved by a domain decomposition method. The method is direct in the sense that for any given order of accuracy, the number of arithmetic operations is fixed. Numerical experiments show that these high-order solvers easily outperform standard second-order ones. The very fast algorithm in combination with the coarser grid allowed for by the high-order method, also makes it quite possible to compete with adaptive methods and irregular grids for problems with solutions containing widely different scales.	domain decomposition methods;solver	Bertil Gustafsson;Lina Hemmingsson-Frändén	1999	J.

Recently, a modified finite element method with strain smoothing, the node-based smoothed finite element method (NS-FEM), has been proposed to solve solid mechanics problems. It has been found in some cases that the energy norm formed by the smoothed strain of NS-FEM solutions bounds the energy norm of exact displacements from above. We analyze the bounding property of this method, give three kind of energy norms of solutions computed by FEM and NS-FEM, and extend them to the computation of an upper bound and a lower bound on the linear functional of displacements. By examining the bounding property of NS-FEM with different energy norms using some linear elastic problems, the advantages of NS-FEM over the traditional error estimate based methods is observed.	smoothed finite element method;smoothing	Z.

The problem involves a source term with a spatially dependent potential, given by the dielectric permittivity profile, and quenching corresponds to a touchdown phenomenon. It is well known that quenching does occur. We prove that touchdown cannot occur at zero points of the permittivity profile. In particular, we remove the assumption of compactness of the touchdown set, made in all previous work on the subject and whose validity is unknown in most typical cases. This answers affirmatively a conjecture made in [W. Guo, Z. Pan, and M. J. Ward, SIAM J. Appl. Math., 66 (2005), pp. 309–338] on the basis of numerical evidence. The result crucially depends on a new type I estimate of the quenching rate, that we establish. In addition we obtain some sufficient conditions for compactness of the touchdown set, without a convexity assumption on the domain. These results may be of some qualitative importance in applications to MEMS optimal design, especially for devices such as microvalves.	kinetic data structure;microelectromechanical systems;numerical analysis;optimal design;semilinear response	Jong-Shenq Guo;Philippe Souplet	2015	SIAM J.

The corresponding homogeneous solution to the differential equation is assumed to be non-expansive and the inhomogeneity is a linear function of the control variable that is constant along a priori given sub-intervals. The optimal control minimises a convex functional that depends, possibly in a nonlinear way, on the solution of the differential equation. Infinite time horizons are allowed. In view of the piecewise constant control, the corresponding Lagrangian can be split into the sum of Lagrangians acting on sub-intervals. The two algorithms suggested are based upon an iterative process that takes advantage of this splitting as well as of the explicit solution to the differential constraints. Convergence results are provided under suitable assumptions on the problem’s data. Finally, numerical tests for a model of global warming demonstrate the performance of the algorithms.	approximation algorithm;autonomous robot;converge;convex function;discretization;experiment;iteration;iterative method;linear function;linear system;loss function;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method;optimal control;optimization problem;quadratic function;total variation denoising	Etienne Emmrich;Horst Schmitt	2006	Optimization Methods and Software	10.1080/10556780500150416	convex function;ordinary differential equation;equilibrium point;mathematical optimization;linear-quadratic regulator;exact differential equation;examples of differential equations;mathematical analysis;exponential integrator;iteration;convergence;optimal control;global warming;hyperbolic partial differential equation;method of characteristics;weak solution;universal differential equation;integrating factor;calculus;linear differential equation;delay differential equation;mathematics;homogeneous differential equation;characteristic equation;separable partial differential equation;initial value problem;differential equation;stiff equation;order of accuracy	Theory	86.79463527020849	14.91420632398294	36827

Its analytic steady state solutions fulfill bounds for some mobility and recombination/generation models. The main goal of this paper is to establish the identical bounds for discrete in space, steady state solutions on 3d boundary conforming Delaunay grids and the classical Scharfetter-Gummel-scheme. Together with a uniqueness proof for small applied voltages and the known dissipativity (continuous as well as space and time discrete) these discretization techniques carry over the essential analytic properties to the discrete case. The proofs are of interest for deriving averaging schemes for space or state dependent material parameters, which are preserving these qualitative properties, too. To illustrate the properties of the scheme 1, 4, 16 elementary cells of a modified CoolMOS like structure are depleted by increasing the applied voltage until steady state avalanche breakdown occurs. 2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 65M12, 35K65.	approximation;delaunay triangulation;discretization;mathematics subject classification;semiconductor;steady state	K.

2a3b2df41bb3c4cacdd071ce5bfea722c20edbdb	coupling fluid-structure interaction with phase-field fracture: modeling and a numerical example		In this work, a framework for coupling arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian fluid-structure interaction with phase-field fracture is suggested. The key idea is based on applying the weak form of phase-field fracture, including a crack irreversibility constraint, to the nonlinear coupled system of Navier-Stokes and elasticity. The resulting setting is formulated via variational-monolithic coupling and has four unknowns: velocities, displacements, pressure, and a phase-field variable. The inequality constraint is imposed through penalization using an augmented Lagrangian algorithm. The nonlinear problem is solved with Newton’s method. The framework is tested in terms of a numerical example in which computational stability is demonstrated by evaluating goal functionals on different spatial meshes.

We define the sheath by a monotone stationary solution to the Euler--Poisson equations under a condition known as the Bohm criterion and consider a situation in which charged particles accumulate on the boundary due to the flux from the inner region. Under this fluid-boundary interactive setting, we prove the asymptotic stability of the sheath for both the nondegenerate and degenerate cases based on a weighted energy method. At the same time, we obtain convergence rates toward the stationary solution subject to the spatial decay rates of the initial perturbation.	euler	Masashi Ohnawa	2015	SIAM J. Math.

Higher-order response models are better for capturing and displaying the characteristics such data can reveal, but response surface models traditionally are linear or quadratic (first or second order) only. If attempted for a higher order, the matrix X of the test inputs formed for fitting the test responses often immediately stops satisfying the full-rank assumption on X traditionally made for computing the regression coefficients. The resulting product matrix XTX is singular and hence cannot be inverted, directly or indirectly, for obtaining the desired least-squares regression coefficients from the system of normal equations. Ill-conditioning of X when near rank deficiency, not unusual even in the traditional second-order response modeling, can also render the computed coefficients unreliable. This paper incorporates singular value decomposition (SVD) to handle the rank deficiency and ill-conditioning problems directly. The proposed SVD-based fitting algorithm enables response modeling to the desirable high-order reliably and efficiently with no difficulty despite rank deficiency in X. Two proposed trimming algorithms enable reduction of redundant terms or insignificant coefficients of the fitted polynomials on a sound mathematical base.	algorithm;angular defect;coefficient;column (database);command & conquer:yuri's revenge;condition number;fitness function;interpolation;linear least squares (mathematics);numerical aperture;operational amplifier;polynomial;quadratic function;response surface methodology;rounding;significant figures;singular value decomposition;test data;the matrix;truncation;xtx	JiGuan G.

The equations are fourth order degenerate parabolic, and may contain singular terms of second order which are to model van der Waals interactions. A subtle discretization of the arising nonlinearities allows us to prove discrete counterparts of the essential estimates found in the continuous setting. By use of the entropy estimate, strong convergence results for discrete solutions are obtained. In particular, the limit of discrete fluxes Mh(Uh)∇Ph will be identified with the flux M(u)∇(W'(u) - Δu) in the continuous setting. As a by-product, first results on existence and positivity almost everywhere of solutions to equations with singular lower order terms can be established in the continuous setting.

The algorithm is based on solving a non-linear fourth order partial differential equation (PDE) that only depends on intrinsic surface properties instead of being derived from a particular surface parameterization. This continuous PDE has a (representation-independent) welldefined solution which we approximate by our triangle mesh. Hence, changing the mesh complexity (refinement) or the mesh connectivity (remeshing) leads to just another discretization of the same smooth surface and doesn’t affect the resulting geometric shape beyond this. This is typically not true for filter-based mesh smoothing algorithms. To simplify the computation we factorize the fourth order PDE into a set of two nested second order problems thus avoiding the estimation of higher order derivatives. Further acceleration is achieved by applying multigrid techniques on a fine-to-coarse hierarchical mesh representation.	approximation algorithm;computation;discretization;fairness measure;higher-order function;interpolation;multigrid method;nonlinear system;polygon mesh;rsa problem;refinement (computing);smoothing;triangle mesh	Robert Schneider;Leif Kobbelt	2001	Computer Aided Geometric Design	10.1016/S0167-8396(01)00036-X	parametrization;topology;calculus;discretization;mathematics;geometry;laplacian smoothing;pde surface;t-vertices;statistics	Graphics	96.25350765894366	13.568927332201472	38440

It operates directly on the second-order form of the governing equation and does not require any stabilization. Its spatial basis functions are chosen among the free-space solutions of the homogeneous form of the partial differential equation obtained after time-discretization. It also features Lagrange multipliers for enforcing a weak continuity of the approximated solution across the element interface boundaries. This leads to a system of differential–algebraic equations which are time-integrated by an implicit family of schemes. The numerical stability of these schemes and the well-posedness of the overall discretization method are supported by a theoretical analysis. The performance of this method is demonstrated for various high Peclet number constant-coefficient model flow problems.	discontinuous galerkin method	Raunak Borker;Charbel Farhat;Radek Tezaur	2017	J.

The convex splitting scheme we use here is a linear unconditionally stable method but is only of first-order accuracy, so the SDC method can be used to iteratively improve the rate of convergence. However, it is found that the accuracy improvement may affect the overall energy stability which is intrinsic to the phase-field models. To compromise the accuracy and stability, a local p-adaptive strategy is proposed to enhance the accuracy by sacrificing some local energy stability in an acceptable level. The proposed strategy is found very useful for producing accurate numerical solutions at small time (dynamics) as well as long time (steady state) with reasonably large time stepsizes. Numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate the high effectiveness of the proposed numerical strategy.	computer simulation;experiment;first-order reduction;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;numerical method;rate of convergence;semiconductor industry;smart data compression;steady state	Xinlong Feng;Tao Tang;Jiang Yang	2015	SIAM J.

1c69a620ec40796526819998bb2538d6a5687843	a p-multigrid strategy with anisotropic p-adaptation based on truncation errors for high-order discontinuous galerkin methods		Abstract High-order discontinuous Galerkin methods have become a popular technique in computational fluid dynamics because their accuracy increases spectrally in smooth solutions with the order of the approximation. However, their main drawback is that increasing the order also increases the computational cost. Several techniques have been introduced in the past to reduce this cost. On the one hand, local mesh adaptation strategies based on error estimation have been proposed to reduce the number of degrees of freedom while keeping a similar accuracy. On the other hand, multigrid solvers may accelerate time marching computations for a fixed number of degrees of freedom. In this paper, we combine both methods and present a novel anisotropic p-adaptation multigrid algorithm for steady-state problems that uses the multigrid scheme both as a solver and as an anisotropic error estimator. To achieve this, we show that a recently developed anisotropic truncation error estimator [1, A. M. Rueda-Ramirez, G. Rubio, E. Ferrer, E. Valero, Truncation error estimation in the p-anisotropic discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method, J. Sci. Comput.] is perfectly suited to be performed inside the multigrid cycle with negligible extra cost. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-stage p-adaptation procedure which reduces the computational time when very accurate results are required. The proposed methods are tested for the compressible Navier–Stokes equations, where we investigate two steady-state cases. First, the 2D boundary layer flow on a flat plate is studied to assess accuracy and computational cost of the algorithm, where a speed-up of 816 is achieved compared to the traditional explicit method. Second, the 3D flow around a sphere is simulated and used to test the anisotropic properties of the proposed method, where a speed-up of 152 is achieved compared to the explicit method. The proposed multi-stage procedure achieved a speed-up of 2.6 in comparison to the single-stage method in highly accurate simulations.		Andrés M.

These problems typically exhibit two overlapping boundary layers at both end points of the spatial domain. A decomposition of the exact solution into its regular and singular part is established, given appropriate bounds for the partial derivatives of the exact solution up to sixth order. These bounds are crucial to prove the uniform convergence of a numerical method that combines the classical backward Euler method and a hybrid finite difference scheme defined on a special nonuniform mesh condensing in the layer regions. The numerical method is uniformly convergent in the discrete maximum norm, and it has first and third order of convergence in time and space, respectively. Numerical results for some test problems are showed, illustrating in practice the order of convergence theoretically proved.	parabolic antenna	Carmelo Clavero;Jose L.

An adaptive algorithm with variable time and space steps is proposed and studied. At each time step in this algorithm grid coarsening occurs solely at the final iteration of the adaptive procedure, meaning that only time and space refinement is allowed before the final iteration. It is proved that at each time step this adaptive algorithm is capable of reducing errors below a given tolerance in a finite number of iteration steps. Numerical results are presented to check the theoretical analysis.	error detection and correction;galerkin method	Ming Cui;Zhangxin Chen;Richard E. Ewing;Guan Qin;Hongsen Chen	2012	Adv. Comput.

The method combines a coordinate transformation (mapping) based on an analytical function and the finite differences method (FDM) for solving the single-band Schrodinger equation. We explore suitable coordinate transformations and propose those, which might simultaneously provide a satisfactory fit of the quantum dash heterointerface and creation of an appropriate computational domain which encloses the quantum dash structure. After mapping of the quantum dash and the rest of computational domain, the Schrodinger equation is solved by the FDM in the mapped space. For the proposed coordinate transformations, we investigate and analyze applicability, robustness and convergence of the method by varying the FDM grid density and size of the computational domain. We find that the method provides sufficient accuracy, stability and flexibility with respect to the size and shape of the quantum dash and above all, extreme simplicity, which is promising and essential for an extension of the method to the multiband Schrodinger equation case.	electronic band structure;finite difference method;numerical analysis	B.

Our main contribution is the use of long-term temporal changes in pressure to extend the commonly used semi-Lagrangian scheme further back along the time axis. Our algorithm starts by tracing sample points along a trajectory following the velocity field backwards in time for many steps. During this backtracing process, the pressure gradient along the path is integrated to correct the velocity of the current time step. We show that our method effectively suppresses numerical diffusion, retains small-scale vorticity, and provides better long-term kinetic energy preservation.	algorithm;apache axis;elasticity (data store);fluid animation;gradient;javaserver pages;maccormack method;material point method;numerical diffusion;semi-lagrangian scheme;semiconductor industry;simulation;turbulence;velocity (software development)	Takahiro Sato;Christopher Batty;Takeo Igarashi;Ryoichi Ando	2018	Computational Visual Media	10.1007/s41095-018-0117-9	advection;computer vision;kinetic energy;mathematical optimization;animation;pressure gradient;artificial intelligence;method of characteristics;trajectory;numerical diffusion;mathematics;vorticity	Graphics	94.14829472285115	5.962847788702448	39700

8fd98158d79e8c7673110db331db61608a8c38a9	solving stochastic differential equations through genetic programming and automatic differentiation		Abstract This paper investigates the potential of evolutionary algorithms, developed using a combination of genetic programming and automatic differentiation, to obtain symbolic solutions to stochastic differential equations. Using the MATLAB programming environment and based on the theory of stochastic calculus, we develop algorithms and conceive a new methodology of resolution. Relative to other methods, this method has the advantages of producing solutions in symbolic form and in continuous time and, in the case in which an equation of interest is completely unknown, of offering the option of algorithms that perform the specification and estimation of the solution to the equation via a real database. The last advantage is important because it determines an appropriate solution to the problem and simultaneously eliminates the difficult task of arbitrarily defining the functional form of the stochastic differential equation that represents the dynamics of the phenomenon under analysis. The equation for geometric Brownian motion, which is usually applied to model prices and returns from financial assets, was employed to illustrate and test the quality of the algorithms that were developed. The results are promising and indicate that the proposed methodology can be a very effective alternative for resolving stochastic differential equations.	automatic differentiation;genetic programming	Waldir Jesus de Araujo Lobão;Marco Aurélio Cavalcanti Pacheco;Douglas Mota Dias;Ana Carolina Alves Abreu	2018	Eng.

This is crucial when refining model resolution and also when the phenomena progresses quickly from one step to another. We propose a mathematical reformulation of the problem as a nonlinear equation and adopt different numerical methods to solve it efficiently. Compared to a previous work of the authors, the resulting code shows a great improvement of performance. This gain is important for further application of aseismic slip process along the fault interface, in the context of plate convergence as well as the reactivation of fault systems in reservoirs.	algorithm;computation	Farid Smaï;Hideo Aochi	2017		10.1016/j.procs.2017.05.273	mathematical optimization;computation;nonlinear system;computer science;numerical analysis;discontinuity (linguistics);slip (materials science);algorithm;convergence (routing)	Theory	92.06431320712967	11.272938531215475	39971
1c767f378cc6ffdf294b14c4bb13ca57064a73b9	an arbitrary-order, fully implicit, hybrid kinetic solver for linear radiative transport using integral deferred correction		Abstract In this work, we describe the implementation of an arbitrarily high-order hybrid solver for linear, kinetic, radiative transport equations. The hybrid method is derived from a splitting of the radiative flux into free-streaming and collisional components to which high- and low-resolution discrete ordinates methods are applied, respectively. Arbitrarily high orders of accuracy with respect to time and space are attained by combining an integral deferred correction (IDC) time integration scheme constructed with implicit Euler substepping on Radau II (right biased) nodes with an upwind discontinuous Galerkin (DG) spatial discretization on uniform Cartesian meshes. Numerical experiments are used to demonstrate that the aforementioned IDC methods can be constructed such that they are unconditionally stable ( L -stable) to within machine precision. Asymptotic analysis is used to show that such IDC methods also preserve the diffusion limit of the underlying transport equation on the semi-discrete level, in the sense that the semi-discrete transport system under an implicit IDC discretization recovers the same IDC discretization of the limiting diffusion equation. Convergence results in one spatial dimension are provided, and it is found that while the hybrid method exhibits convergence stagnation and order reduction in certain scenarios, the overall accuracy of the hybrid approximation is comparable to a standard discrete ordinates approximation in many cases. Numerical results for two test problems in two spatial dimensions are given to compare the computational efficiency of the hybrid method against a standard discrete ordinates method, and to compare the efficiency of space–time discretizations of different orders of accuracy. The results indicate that a properly chosen hybrid discrete ordinates method can be more efficient than a standard discrete ordinates method by a factor of between 2 and 8 when IDC timestepping methods are used. Further, among the first-, third-, and fifth-order space–time discretizations considered here, the first-order method is the least efficient and the third-order method is the most efficient.	solver	Michael M.

19513cb0a26fdf0bca6323715ea12fc9d50e3399	on the numerical evaluation of local curvature for diffuse interface models of microstructure evolution		Abstract Within diffuse interface models for multiphase problems, the curvature of the phase boundary can be expressed as the difference of two terms, a Laplacian and a second, gradient, term of the diffuse interface variable, o. In phase field simulations of microstructure evolution, the second term is often replaced by f’(o) = df/do, where f(o) is the potential function in the free energy functional of the underlying physical model. We show here that this replacement systematically deteriorates the accuracy in local curvature evaluation as compared to a discretized evaluation of the second term. Analytic estimates reveal that the discretization errors in the Laplacian and in the second term have roughly the same spatial dependence across the interface, thus leading to a cancellation of errors in k. This is confirmed in a test case, where the discretization error can be determined via comparison to the exact solution. If, however, the second term is replaced by a quasi exact expression, the error in ∆ o enters k without being compensated and can obscure the behavior of the local curvature. Due to the antisymmetric variations of this error term, approaches using the average curvature, as obtained from an integral along the interface normal, are immune to this problem.	numerical analysis	Samad Vakili;Ingo Steinbach;Fathollah Varnik	2017		10.1016/j.procs.2017.05.256	mathematical optimization;curvature;discretization;antisymmetric relation;exact solutions in general relativity;computer science;spatial dependence;energy functional;phase boundary;laplace operator	Vision	92.76078682417608	8.768349302651895	40025

The up-to-date theoretical explanation of the numerical stability relies on the assumption that the derivative of the nonlinear potential function satisfies a Lipschitz type condition, which in a rigorous sense, implies the boundedness of the numerical solution. In this work we remove the Lipschitz assumption on the nonlinearity and prove unconditional energy stability for the stabilized semi-implicit time-stepping methods. It is shown that the size of stabilization term depends on the initial energy and the perturbation parameter but is independent of the time step. The corresponding error analysis is also established under minimal nonlinearity and regularity assumptions.	computation;error analysis (mathematics);nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical partial differential equations;numerical stability;perturbation theory (quantum mechanics);semiconductor industry;simulation;spectral method;stepping level	Dong Li;Zhonghua Qiao;Tao Tang	2016	SIAM J.

The method consists of fitting the local representation of the manifold using a jet, and either interpolation or approximation. A jet is a truncated Taylor expansion, and the incentive for using jets is that they encode all local geometric quantities —such as normal, curvatures, extrema of curvature. On the way to using jets, the question of estimating differential properties is recasted into the more general framework of multivariate interpolation/approximation, a well-studied problem in numerical analysis. On a theoretical perspective, we prove several convergence results when the samples get denser. For curves and surfaces, these results involve asymptotic estimates with convergence rates depending upon the degree of the jet used. For the particular case of curves, an error bound is also derived. To the best of our knowledge, these results are among the first ones providing accurate estimates for differential quantities of order three and more. On the algorithmic side, we solve the interpolation/approximation problem using Vandermonde systems. Experimental results for surfaces of 3 are reported. These experiments illustrate the asymptotic convergence results, but also the robustness of the methods on general Computer Graphics models. Key-words: Meshes, Point Clouds, Differential Geometry, Interpolation, Approximation. Estimation des Quantités Différentielles par Ajustement Polynomial des Jets Osculateurs Résumé : Ce rapport concerne l’estimation locale des propriétés différentielles d’une variété lisse S –une courbe dans le plan ou une surface en 3D– à partir d’un nuage de points échantillonnés sur S. La méthde consiste à ajuster la représentation locale de la variété par un jet, en interpolant ou approximant. Un jet est un développement de Taylor tronqué, et l’intérêt des jets est qu’ils codent toutes les quantités géométriques locales –telles que la normale, les courbures, les extrema de courbure. Avec l’utilisation des jets, le problème d’estimation des quantités différentielles est placé dans le cadre plus général de l’interpolation/approximation multivariée, un sujet classique d’analyse numérique. Sur le plan théorique, nous donnons des résultats de convergence lorsque l’échantillonnage est raffiné. Pour les courbes et surfaces, ces résutats sont des estimations asymptotiques avec des vitesses de convergence fonction du degré du jet utilisé. Pour le cas des courbes, une majoration d’erreur est aussi fournie. A notre connaissance, ces résutats sont parmi les premiers fournissant des estimations précises pour les quantités différentielles d’ordre trois et plus. Sur le plan algorithmique, nous traitons le problème d’interpolation/approximation avec des systèmes de Vandermonde. Des résultats expérimentaux pour les surfaces de R3 sont analysés. Ces expérimentations illustrent les résultats de convergence asymptotique, ainsi que la robustesse de la méthode sur des modèles de Computer Graphics.

We base this framework heavily on components from PETSc, a scientific library geared toward implementing scalable solvers needed for approximating solutions to partial differential equations. Our open source library can be used to assemble matrices and vectors which, for this release, come from a Galerkin weak form, discretized with the Non-Uniform Rational B-spline (NURBS) basis. We also detail the computation of these basis functions as well as how higher-order derivatives may be pushed forward for use in isoparametric mappings. Finally, we show performance results on a variety of nonlinear and time dependent problems illustrating the flexibility and efficiency of our framework. We solve large deformation hyper-elasticity, the Cahn-Hilliard equation, the NavierStokes-Korteweg equation, as well as Navier-Stokes in context of turbulent flow modeled with the variational multiscale method.	basis function;calculus of variations;computation;discretization;elasticity (data store);galerkin method;hyper-heuristic;hyper-threading;isogeometric analysis;lina;minimal mappings;nc (complexity);navier–stokes equations;non-uniform rational b-spline;nonlinear system;numpy;open-source software;petsc;scalability;turbulence;variational monte carlo;weak formulation;weatherstar;matplotlib	Nathan O.

Time derivative is discretized by forward difference and then quasilinearization technique is used to linearize the coupled Burgers’ equation. Space derivatives discretization with Haar wavelets leads to a system of linear equations and is solved usingMatlab7.0. Convergence analysis of proposed scheme exhibits that the error bound is inversely proportional to the resolution level of the Haar wavelet. Finally, the adaptability of proposed scheme is demonstrated by numerical experiments and shows that the present composite scheme offers better accuracy in comparison with other existing numerical methods. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The flow is governed by an ideal polytropic gas and undergoes a one-step exothermic chemical reaction under the reaction rate function that is Lipschtiz and has a positive lower bound. The heat released by the reaction may cause the total variation of the solution to increase along the flow direction. We employ the modified wavefront tracking scheme to construct approximate solutions and develop a Glimm-type functional by incorporating the approximate strong rarefaction waves and Lipschitz bending walls to obtain the uniform bound on the total variation of the approximate solutions.

5d8f6db980c62712d84a637b48fed0fd8d29b6c4	crack detection in beam structures with a novel laplace based wavelet finite element method		Beam structure is one of the most widely used structures in mechanical engineering and civil engineering. Ultrasonic guided wave based crack identification is one of the most important and accepted approaches applied to detect unseen small flaws in structures. Numerical simulations of ultrasonic guided wave propagation have caught more and more attention due to the fast development of hardware and software in the last few years. From all the numerical simulation methods, wavelet based finite element method has been proved to be one of the most efficient methods due to its better spatial resolution, which means it needs fewer elements to get the same accuracy and it can improve the calculation cost significantly. However, it needs a very small time interval. Laplace transform can easily convert the time domain into a frequency domain and then revert it back to a time domain. Laplace transform has thus the advantage of finding better results with a very large time interval. which can save a lot of time cost. This paper will present an innovative method combining Laplace transform and the B-spline wavelet on interval (BSWI) finite element method. This novel method allows to get results with the same accuracy and with a significantly lower time cost, which would not only decrease the total number of elements in the structure but also increase the time integration interval. The numerical Laplace transform and BSWI finite element will be introduced. Moreover, this innovative method is applied to simulate the ultrasonic wave propagation in a beam structure in different materials. Numerical examples for crack identification in beam structures have been studied for verification.	b-spline;computer simulation;finite element method;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;numerical method;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations;software propagation;spline (mathematics);spline wavelet	Shuaifang Zhang;Dongsheng Li;Wei Shen;Xiwen Zhang;Yu Liu	2017	CoRR		wavelet;frequency domain;mathematical optimization;mathematics;beam (structure);finite element method;guided wave testing;laplace transform;time domain;ultrasonic sensor	Robotics	95.39919638648381	4.867416321362798	40904

This second-order equation is first recast into an equivalent first-order system by introducing several “field” variables. A combination of scaled L and H norms is then applied to the residual of this system to create a least-squares functional. It is shown that, in an appropriate Hilbert space, the homogeneous part of this functional is equivalent to a squared graph norm, that is, a product norm on the space of individual variables. This equivalence to a norm that decouples the variables means that standard finite element discretization techniques and standard multigrid solvers can be applied to obtain optimal performance. However, this equivalence is not uniform in the wavenumber k, which can signal degrading performance of the numerical solution process as k increases. To counter this difficulty, we obtain a result that characterizes the error components causing performance degradation. We do this by defining a finite-dimensional subspace of these components on whose orthogonal complement k-uniform equivalence is proved for this functional and an analogous functional that is based only on L norms. This subspace equivalence motivates a nonstandard multigrid method that attempts to achieve optimal convergence uniformly in k. We report on numerical experiments that empirically confirm k-uniform optimal performance of this multigrid solver. We also report on tests of the error in our discretization that seem to confirm optimal accuracy that is free of the so-called pollution effect.	discretization;elegant degradation;experiment;finite element method;first-order predicate;first-order reduction;hilbert space;least squares;multigrid method;numerical analysis;numerical partial differential equations;solver;turing completeness	Barry Lee;Thomas A.

Combined with Chebyshev spectral differentiation, the tensor approach significantly reduces the degrees of freedom of the approximation essentially in exchange for nonlinearity, such that the resulting discretized nonlinear system is solved by alternating least squares. Enforcement of the normality condition via a penalty method avoids the need for exploration of the the null space of the discretized Fokker-Planck operator. The proposed method enables a drastic reduction of degrees of freedom required to maintain accuracy as dimensionality increases.

This framework introduces a semi-implicit update of the terms that give rise to buoyancy oscillations, which permits a stable integration of the Navier-Stokes equations when a background density stratification is present. The lepticity of each grid in the AMR hierarchy, which serves as a useful metric for anisotropy, is used to select one of several different efficient Poisson-solving techniques. In this way, we compute the pressure over the entire set of AMR grids without resorting to the hydrostatic approximation, which can degrade the structure of internal waves whose dynamics may have large-scale significance. We apply the modeling framework to three test cases, for which numerical or analytical solutions are known that can be used to benchmark the results. In all the cases considered, the model achieves an excellent degree of congruence with the benchmark, while at the same time achieving a substantial reduction of the computational resources needed.

0c8a7dad881a1a997b3b3db09549c00880d2e66e	a priori and a posteriori error analyses of an augmented hdg method for a class of quasi-newtonian stokes flows		In a recent work we developed a new hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method for a class of nonlinear Stokes models arising in quasi-Newtonian fluids. The approach there uses the incompressibility condition to eliminate the pressure, sets the gradient of the velocity as an auxiliary unknown, and enriches the original formulation with convenient redundant equations, thus giving rise to an augmented scheme. However, the corresponding analysis, which makes use of a fixed point strategy that depends on a suitably chosen parameter, yields optimal rates of convergence for only two of the six resulting unknowns, whereas the reported numerical results, showing higher orders than predicted, support the conjecture that the a priori error estimates are not sharp. In the present paper, the main features of the aforementioned augmented formulation are maintained, but after introducing slight modifications of the finite element subspaces for the pseudostress and velocity, we are able to significantly improve our previous analyses and results. More precisely, on one hand we realize here that it suffices to choose the stabilization tensor as the identity times the meshsize, and hence neither fixed-point arguments nor related parameters are needed anymore to establish the well-posedness of the discrete scheme, and on the other hand we now prove optimally convergent approximations for all the unknowns. Furthermore, we develop a reliable and efficient residual-based a posteriori error estimator, and propose the associated adaptive algorithm for our HDG approximation of the nonlinear model problem.

68c62fb2f06ca10bf97fbd6403f7f340f0604242	conservative model reduction for finite-volume models		This work proposes a method for model reduction of finite-volume models that guarantees the resulting reduced-order model is conservative, thereby preserving the structure intrinsic to finite-volume discretizations. The proposed reduced-order models associate with optimization problems characterized by a minimum-residual objective function and nonlinear equality constraints that explicitly enforce conservation over subdomains. Conservative Galerkin projection arises from formulating this optimization problem at the time-continuous level, while conservative least-squares Petrov–Galerkin (LSPG) projection associates with a time-discrete formulation. We equip these approaches with hyper-reduction techniques in the case of nonlinear flux and source terms, and also provide approaches for handling infeasibility. In addition, we perform analyses that include deriving conditions under which conservative Galerkin and conservative LSPG are equivalent, as well as deriving a posteriori error bounds. Numerical experiments performed on a parameterized quasi-1D Euler equation demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to ensure not only global conservation, but also significantly lower state-space errors than nonconservative reduced-order models such as standard Galerkin and LSPG projection.	computation;discretization;euler;experiment;galerkin method;least squares;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;optimization problem;simulation;state space	Kevin Carlberg;Youngsoo Choi;Syuzanna Sargsyan	2018	J.

The level set method captures the interface as an isocontour of a scalar level set function. The method has many advantages, including the ability to express many geometric quantities, such as the interface curvature, as derivatives of the level set. However, the numerically constructed level set function may not be smooth enough to compute the required derivatives. Furthermore, the method overall is known for having a high sensitivity to numerical dissipation. The former of these two shortfalls is addressed by augmenting the traditional level set equations with an explicitly tracked interface curvature. The curvature is then updated alongside the level set through an additional advection equation. The latter shortfall is addressed by combining a new velocity extension, that better maintains the signed-distance property of the level set, with a reconstruct-evolve-average approach to advancing the advection eq...

This generalization relies on the algebra of oscillations with a continuous oscillatory spectrum, which is wider than the usual spaces of periodic or almost-periodic functions. We perform the analysis for general nonlinear hyperbolic systems, both in the dispersive and in the nondispersive cases, and particularly focus on the behavior of the nonlinearities. Our tools yield considerable simplifications in these nonlinearities, which allows us to point out qualitative differences between the dispersive and the nondispersive cases. Finally, we study in detail two physical examples which can be modeled with the present tools: lasers with large spectrums, and those with ultrashort pulses.	almost periodic function;dispersive partial differential equation;nonlinear system	Karen Barrailh;David Lannes	2002	SIAM J.

Introducing the additional vorticity variable, we rewrite the governing equations of incompressible inviscid rotational flow in the velocity–vorticity–pressure formulation and then further split the formulation into the pressure and velocity–vorticity subsystems. After time-discretizing the time derivative and linearizing the non-linear terms, we reach the stationary velocity–vorticity system. The L 2 least-squares finite element approach is applied to generate accurate numerical solutions of the velocity–vorticity system with suitable boundary conditions. We show that this approach produces an optimal rate of convergence in the H 1 norm for velocity and suboptimal rate in the L 2 norm for vorticity. A numerical example is given which confirms the theoretical results.	finite element method;least squares;velocity (software development)	Chiung-Chiou Tsai;Suh-Yuh Yang	2007	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2006.07.058		HPC	89.1743432604248	14.355938157748657	42340

The local isotropic realizability in R3 is obtained by Frobenius’ theorem provided that j and curl j are orthogonal in R3. A counter-example shows that Frobenius’ condition is not sufficient to derive the global isotropic realizability in R3. However, assuming that (j, curl j, j × curl j) is an orthogonal basis of R3, an admissible conductivity σ is constructed from a combination of the three dynamical flows along the directions j/|j|, curl j/|curl j| and (j/|j|2) × curl j. When the field j is periodic, the isotropic realizability in the torus needs in addition a boundedness assumption satisfied by the flow along the third direction (j/|j|2)×curl j. Several examples illustrate the sharpness of the realizability conditions.	dynamical system;gradient;curl	Marc Briane;Graeme W. Milton	2015	SIAM J.

Adaptive local grid refinement can improve solution accuracy without sacrificing computational efficiency because computer efforts are focused on the rough regions (i.e., requiring high spatial resolution) of the problem domain. To implement adaptive grids, a backward/forward particle tracking technique is applied in the Lagrangian step, and the interpolation errors of the Lagrangian concentrations are compared with prescribed error tolerances to determine rough regions. A modular setting of the grid generation is then used to generate locally zooming grids and to prepare information for applying multigrid methods. The Lagrangian concentrations of the newly generated nodes at the finest grid level are also evaluated by performing a backward tracking. Multigrid strategies which can effectively eliminate the smooth component error through coarse grid correction are finally applied in the Eulerian step to solve the matrix equations for further saving of computer time. Example problems are used to demonstrate the success of this integrated approach. r 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

At first, the generalized Burgers–Fisher equation and the cubic B-spline quasi-interpolation are introduced. Moreover, the numerical scheme is presented, by using the derivative of the quasi-interpolation to approximate the spatial derivative of the dependent variable and a low order forward difference to approximate the time derivative of the dependent variable. Moreover, the stability of this method is studied. At last, the numerical results obtained by this way have been compared with the exact solution to show the efficiency of the method. The main advantage of the resulting scheme is that the algorithm is very simple, so it is very easy to implement.	b-spline;cubic function;interpolation;numerical partial differential equations	Chun-Gang Zhu;Wen-Sheng Kang	2010	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2010.03.113		Theory	88.63516048395071	12.497996774167955	42810

In smooth regions, the scheme applies the central nonlinear interpolation with minimum dissipation to resolve fluctuating flow features while in regions containing discontinuities and high wavenumber features, the scheme suppresses spurious numerical oscillations by hybridizing the central interpolation with the more dissipative upwind-biased nonlinear interpolation. In capturing material interfaces between species of different densities, a quasi-conservative five equation model that can conserve mass of each species is used to prevent pressure oscillations across the interfaces. Compared to upwind-biased interpolations with classical nonlinear weights [1] ;  [2] and improved weights [3], and the interpolation with adaptive central-upwind weights for scale-separation [4], it is shown that WCNS with the proposed localized dissipative interpolation has better performance to simultaneously capture discontinuities and resolve smooth features.	nonlinear system	Man Long Wong;Sanjiva K.

In this paper we deal with two problems of 3Dmodelling and simulation in this field, which are very often neglected in the literature. On the one hand blood flow in arteries is characterized by travelling pressure waves due to the interaction of blood with the vessel wall. On the other hand, blood exhibits non-Newtonian properties, like shear-thinning, viscoelasticity and thixotropy. The present work is concerned with the coupling of a generalized Newtonian fluid, accounting for the shearthinning behaviour of blood, with an elastic structure describing the vessel wall, to capture the pulse wave due to the interaction between blood and the vessel wall. We provide an energy estimate for the coupling and compare the numerical results with those obtained with an equivalent fluid–structure interaction model using a Newtonian fluid. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, by adapting the wetting drying technique discussed in (Ricchiuto and Bolermann, JCP 228, 2009) the scheme is able to preserve the non-negativity of the depth and to handle very well the runup and flooding of complex bathymetries. The approach is analyzed and tested thoroughly. The numerical results on a large variety of problems show the interest in the approach.

This was done in the style of fixes. The first fix, FixGFC, measures the elastic stiffness coefficients for a (small) solid block of a given material by making use of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. With the help of the second fix, FixGFMD, the coefficients obtained from FixGFC can then be used to compute the elastic forces for a (large) block of the same material. Both fixes are designed to be run in parallel and to exploit the functions provided by LAMMPS.

We assume that the interface is represented by a plane whose normal vector is known and we focus on the volume-matching step that consists in finding the plane constant so that it splits the cell according to a given volume fraction. We follow the same approach as in the recent authors' publication for 2D arbitrary convex cells in planar and axisymmetrical geometries, namely we derive an analytical formula for the volume of the specific prismatoids obtained when decomposing the cell using the planes that are parallel to the interface and passing through all the cell nodes. This formula is used to bracket the interface plane constant such that the volume-matching problem is rewritten in a single prismatoid in which the same formula is used to find the final solution. The proposed method is tested against an important number of reproducible configurations and shown to be at least five times faster.		Steven Diot;Marianne M. Francois	2016	J. Comput.

Because of their nature being able to transport discontinuities of initial or boundary conditions into the domain on which the solution lives or even to develop discontinuities in the presence of smooth data, these problems constitute a severe challenge for both theory and numerics of PDE constrained optimization. In the present paper, optimal control problems for the well-known wave equation are investigated. The intention is to study the order of the numerical approximations for both the optimal state and the optimal control variables while analytical solutions are known here. The numerical method chosen here is a full discretization method based on appropriate finite differences by which the PDE constrained optimal control problem is transformed into a nonlinear programming problem (NLP). Hence we follow here the approach first discretize, then optimize, which allows us to make use not only of powerful methods for the solution of NLPs, but also to compute sensitivity differentials, a necessary tool for real-time control.	approximation;computation;constrained optimization;discretization;finite difference;mathematical optimization;natural language processing;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;numerical linear algebra;numerical method;numerical partial differential equations;optimal control;rate of convergence;real life;real-time clock;real-time transcription;whole earth 'lectronic link	Matthias Gerdts;Günter Greif;Hans Josef Pesch	2008	Mathematics and Computers in Simulation	10.1016/j.matcom.2008.02.014	closed-form expression;mathematical optimization;constrained optimization;finite difference;wave equation;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;real-time control system;optimal control;power iteration;numerical analysis;nonlinear programming;hyperbolic partial differential equation;boundary value problem;mathematics;partial differential equation	Robotics	86.82443439151851	14.86167128766369	43575

To solve this class of problems numerically we consider two finite difference schemes: the backward Euler scheme and a high order hybrid scheme which is a blend of the Trapezoidal scheme and the backward Euler scheme. We derive general convergence results for both the schemes, based on which a number of layer-adapted meshes can be constructed and analyzed. As consequences of these results we establish uniform convergence of the schemes on certain layer-adapted meshes. Numerical experiments confirm our theoretical findings. 2014 Elsevier Inc.

With the aid of two Lagrange multipliers, the new method converts the original volumetric problem to a surface problem by using a higher-order transmission condition at the subdomain interfaces to significantly improve the convergence of the iterative solution of the global interface equation. Similar to the previous version, a global coarse problem related to the degrees of freedom at the subdomain corner edges is formulated to propagate the residual error to the whole computational domain at each iteration, which further increases the rate of convergence. In addition, a fully algebraic preconditioner based on matrix splitting is constructed to make the proposed domain decomposition method even more robust and scalable. Perfectly matched layers (PMLs) are considered for the boundary truncation when solving open-region problems. The influence of the PML truncation on the convergence performance is investigated by examining the convergence of the transmission condition for an interface inside the PML. Numerical examples including wave propagation and antenna radiation problems truncated with PMLs are presented to demonstrate the validity and the capability of this method.	finite element method;maxwell (microarchitecture);preconditioner	Ming-Feng Xue;Jian-Ming Jin	2014	J.

The fluctuating velocity model is derived by splitting the Reynolds decomposed (but not averaged) Navier–Stokes equations into mean and fluctuating expressions. The linear fluctuating portion of the equations (normally lost to averaging) poses a semi-infinite domain eigenvalue problem. Approximate analytical solutions are derived that suggest a qualitatively physically plausible solution. The derivation and use of these expressions are not known in the literature implying that a qualitative scoping study of this nature is appropriate. This type of analysis provides support for the practical application of these equations to estimate structural loadings due to the presence of turbulent velocity and pressure fluctuations. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The code automatically detects and locates accurately the switching points of the PWS, restarting the integration after each discontinuity. Further, in the case of Filippov systems, algorithms to handle properly sliding mode regimes in an automatic way are included. The code requires the user to provide a description of the IVP and the functions defining the hypersurfaces where the switching points are located, and it returns the discrete approximated solution together with the switching points. Several numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the reliability and efficiency of the code.	approximation algorithm;embedded system;experiment;matlab;mathematical software;microsoft personal web server;numerical analysis;numerical integration;prince;reflections of signals on conducting lines;runge–kutta methods;solver	Manuel Calvo;Juan I.

Our approach combines Arnold’s interpretation of the solution of the Euler equations for incompressible and inviscid fluids as geodesics in the space of measure-preserving diffeomorphisms, and an extrinsic approximation of the equations of geodesics due to Brenier. Using recently developed semi-discrete optimal transport solvers, this approach yields a numerical scheme which is able to handle problems of realistic size in 2D. Our purpose in this article is to establish the convergence of this scheme towards regular solutions of the incompressible Euler equations, and to provide numerical experiments on a few simple test cases in 2D.	approximation algorithm;arnold;euler;experiment;linear algebra;measure-preserving dynamical system;numerical analysis;semiconductor industry;test case;transportation theory (mathematics)	Thomas O.

Motivated by their work, we formally derive this equation from two-dimensional potential flow equations governing the small amplitude long capillary-gravity waves on the surface of shallow water for Bond number very close to but less than 1/3. On the basis of far-field analyses and heuristic arguments, we show that the traveling wave solutions of this equation are weakly non-local solitary waves characterized by small amplitude fast oscillations in the far-field. We review various analytical and numerical methods originally devised to obtain this type of weakly non-local solitary wave solutions of the singularly perturbed (fifth-order) KdV equation. Using these methods, we obtain weakly non-local solitary wave solutions of the singularly perturbed (sixth-order) Boussinesq equation and provide estimates of the amplitude of oscillations which persist in the far-field.	numerical analysis	Ranjan K.

Incompressible turbulent flow is one of these cases which need to be taken in account. Solving the incompressible Navier-stokes equation because of elliptical characteristics has been led to some researches in this field recently. The ACM of Chorin [1] as a pre-conditioner enables the coupling of continuity and momentum equations thus allowing time marching compressible schemes to be applied for incompressible ones. The CB methods for ACM, was proposed by Drikakis et al. [2] based on the definition of primitive variables as functions of their values on the characteristics and formation of compatibility equations. Razavi and Atashbar extended Roe scheme to estimate convective fluxes of incompressible viscous flows past a hydrofoil. This method is based on the propagations of virtual acoustic waves which enables damping the numerical oscillations [3]. Nithiarasu and Liu [4] implemented artificial compressibility to solve incompressible turbulent flows at medium Reynolds numbers with characteristic-based scheme. They used three different turbulence models namely Wolfenstein model, Spalart-Allmaras model and standard   k model. Finite volume method along with hybrid grid and   k turbulence model was proposed by Feng and Shanhang [5]. Yang and Chang [6] used 2D numerical simulation of turbulent flow fields for NREL S809 airfoil. In addition LES is the other field of turbulence modeling which Catalano et al. [7] proposed a LES model to simulate flows past a circular cylinder in supercritical regime by finite deference method. In this study, a finite volume model is presented for solving incompressible turbulent flows past a circular cylinder. Considering Spalart-Allmaras as a turbulence model CB method is used in formulations. The behavior and performance of Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model is investigated. The numerical results are obtained and validated by other available results in the literature.	acoustic cryptanalysis;circular polarization;computation;computer simulation;cylinder seal;finite volume method;large eddy simulation;navier–stokes equations;neural oscillation;numerical analysis;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations;primitive recursive function;scott continuity;spalart–allmaras turbulence model;turbulence modeling;yang	Ali Atashbar Orang;Seyed Esmail Razavi;Hamoon Pourmirzaagha	2014	J.

777a81a02645e6482b9bb57f4852c96ea6f22d36	an extended isogeometric analysis for vibration of cracked fgm plates using higher-order shear deformation theory		A novel and effective formulation that combines the eXtended IsoGeometric Approach (XIGA) and Higher-order Shear Deformation Theory (HSDT) is proposed to study the free vibration of cracked Functionally Graded Material (FGM) plates. Herein, the general HSDT model with five unknown variables per node is applied for calculating the stiffness matrix without needing Shear Correction Factor (SCF). In order to model the discontinuous and singular phenomena in the cracked plates, IsoGeometric Analysis (IGA) utilizing the Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) functions is incorporated with enrichment functions through the partition of unity method. NURBS basis functions with their inherent arbitrary high order smoothness permit the C requirement of the HSDT model.

f10279bc15e2ddf82efaa24c274ca19c585b37ae	multiscale analysis and computation for coupled conduction, convection and radiation heat transfer problem in porous materials		Abstract This paper discusses the multiscale analysis and numerical algorithms for coupled conduction, convection and radiation heat transfer problem in periodic porous materials. First, the multiscale asymptotic expansion of the solution for the coupled problem is presented, and high-order correctors are constructed. Then, error estimates and their proofs will be given on some regularity hypothesis. Finally, the corresponding finite element algorithms based on multiscale method are introduced and some numerical results are given in detail. The numerical tests demonstrate that the developed method is feasible and valid for predicting the heat transfer performance of periodic porous materials, and support the approximate convergence results proposed in this paper.	computation	Zhiqiang Yang;Ziqiang Wang;Zihao Yang;Yi Sun	2018	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2017.12.039	asymptotic expansion;periodic graph (geometry);mathematical optimization;porous medium;finite element method;heat transfer;mathematical proof;convection;mathematics;thermal conduction	Theory	90.10544756713308	9.657943898324405	45058
02d1ed1416a78d7d306aed359014b8a5dfe01c90	lagrangian particle method for compressible fluid dynamics		A new Lagrangian particle method is proposed for solving Euler equations for compressible fluid flow. By representing Lagrangian fluid cells with particles, similarly to smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) [1], the method eliminates the mesh distortion problem of the original Lagrangian method and is suitable for the simulation of complex free surface flows. The main contributions of our method, which is different from SPH in all other aspects, are (a) elimination of the dependence on artificial parameters such as the smoothening length in SPH, causing difficulties especially in the case of large density changes, and (b) significant improvement of approximation of differential operators and convergence of prescribed order. The major drawback of SPH is a very poor accuracy of discrete differential operators. It is widely accepted [2,3] that the traditional SPH discretization has zero-order convergence for widely used kernels. In addition, it depends on artificial parameters, in particular on the smoothening radius, causing major difficulties in the case of large density changes. A number of “modern” or “corrected” SPH methods have been developed in recent years (see [2] and reviews [1,3]). They include the moving-least-squares MLSSPH, “Godunov” SPH, P_SPH, PHANTOM etc. They all improve certain features of SPH at the expense of other properties such as conservation, long-time stability, or prohibitively large number of neighbors that causes other problems, but still remain zero-order convergent, or at best 1 order (MLS). The proposed Lagrangian particle method is significantly different from previous meshless methods. The novel key invention of our method is a stable particle-based upwinding method [4], capable of achieving a prescribed order of accuracy by employing a local optimization / polynomial fit (known also as the generalized finite difference (GFD) method) for the calculation of local gradients. A Riemann problem based algorithm for free surfaces has also been developed. The second order method was tested in one-, two-, and three spatial dimensions. It demonstrated a significant improvement of accuracy and convergence order compared to the traditional SPH. The future development of the space-time discretization methods will explore new high resolution WENO-type solvers based on irregularly placed particle nodes and symplectic integrators. Our Lagrangian particle method, currently developed for compressible fluids, is also generalizable to coupled multiphysics systems, including the dynamics of incompressible fluids, solids, and plasmas. By generalizing this method to elliptic problems, we have recently proposed an optimal meshless solution to the classical particle-in-cell (PIC) problem that exceeded the accuracy and performance of PIC. 1.

Furthermore the numerical solutions of the given problems which are solved by the variational iteration method obviously converge rapidly to exact solutions better than the Legendre polynomial technique. Additionally, although the powerful effect of the applied processes in Legendre polynomial approach arises in the situations where the initial approximation value is unknown, it is shown by the examples that the variational iteration method produces more certain solutions where the first initial function approximation value is estimated. In this paper, the Legendre polynomial approximation (LPA) and the variational iteration method (VIM) are implemented to obtain the solutions of the linear Fredholm integro-differential equations and the numerical solutions with respect to these methods are compared.	approximation;calculus of variations;iteration;legendre polynomials;polynomial	Necdet Bildik;Ali Konuralp;Salih Yalçinbas	2010	Computers & Mathematics with Applications	10.1016/j.camwa.2009.06.022	legendre function;legendre's constant;integro-differential equation;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;legendre polynomials;function approximation;associated legendre polynomials;legendre wavelet;calculus;mathematics;integral equation;legendre's equation	ML	83.48458105882905	16.73190577925515	45459

We start from the primal hybrid formulation of the elliptic model for the pressure. Localization of this infinite-dimensional problem leads to element-level boundary value problems which embed multiscale and high-contrast features in a natural way, with Neumann boundary conditions driven by the Lagrange multipliers. Such a procedure leads to methods involving the space of piecewise constants for the pressure together with a discretization of the fluxes. Choosing (arbitrarily) polynomial interpolations, the lowest-order Raviart-Thomas element as well as some recent multiscale methods are recovered. In addition, the methods assure local mass conservation and can be interpreted as stabilized primal hybrid methods. Extensive numerical validation attests to the accuracy of the new methods on academic and more realistic problems with rough coefficients.	algorithmic efficiency;basis function;celestial emporium of benevolent knowledge;coefficient;computation;discretization;domain decomposition methods;feti;finite element method;interpolation;leo (computer);lagrange multiplier;numerical analysis;numerical method;parallel computing;polynomial;scott continuity;tridiagonal matrix algorithm;velocity (software development)	Christopher Harder;Diego Paredes;Frédéric Valentin	2013	J.

In the first step we construct from an expensive finite element “truth” discretization of dimension N an intermediate RB model of dimension N ≪ N . In the second step we construct from this intermediate RB model a derived RB (DRB) model of dimension M ≤ N . The construction of the DRB model is effected at cost O(N) and in particular at cost independent of N ; subsequent evaluation of the DRB model may then be effected at cost O(M). The DRB model comprises both the DRB output and a rigorous a posteriori error bound for the error in the DRB output with respect to the truth discretization. The new approach is of particular interest in two contexts: focus calculations and hp-RB approximations. In the former the new approach serves to reduce online cost, M ≪ N : the DRB model is restricted to a slice or subregion of a larger parameter domain associated with the intermediate RB model. In the latter the new approach enlarges the class of problems amenable to hp-RB treatment by a significant reduction in offline (precomputation) cost: in the development of the hp parameter domain partition and associated “local” (now derived) RB models the finite element truth is replaced by the intermediate RB model. We present numerical results to illustrate the new approach.	approximation;certified digital radio broadcast specialist;computation;discretization;estimation theory;finite element method;mathematical optimization;memory footprint;navier–stokes equations;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;object storage;online and offline;parabolic antenna;precomputation;speedup;time complexity;uncertainty quantification	Jens L.

For instance, the additional independent variable x may denote the mass of the particle. The describing equation contains additional sink and source terms involving integral operators. Since the coordinate x adds at least one further dimension to the spatial directions and time coordinate, an efficient numerical treatment of the integral terms is crucial. One of the more involved integral terms appearing in population balance models is the coalescence integral, which is of the form ∫ x 0 κ(x− y, y)f(y)f(x− y)dy. The discretisation may use a locally refined grid. In this paper we describe an algorithm which (i) is efficient (the cost is O(N log N), N : data size) and (ii) ensures local mass conservation.

For each α, the distributed parabolic control problem optimizes the internal energy g. It is proven that the optimal control ĝα with optimal state uĝαα and optimal adjoint state pĝαα are convergent as α → ∞ (in norm of a suitable Sobolev parabolic space) to ĝ, uĝ and pĝ , respectively, where the limit problem has Dirichlet (instead of Robin) boundary conditions on Γ1.

The method is based on a piecewise cubic polynomial which provides its solutions a fifth-order accuracy in space. The spatially reconstructed solutions are evolved in time with a fourth-order accuracy by tracing the characteristics of the cubic polynomials. As a result, our temporal update scheme provides a significantly simpler and computationally more efficient approach in achieving fourth order accuracy in time, relative to the comparable fourth-order Runge–Kutta method. We demonstrate that the solutions of PCM converges at fifth-order in solving 1D smooth flows described by hyperbolic conservation laws. We test the new scheme on a range of numerical experiments, including both gas dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics applications in multiple spatial dimensions.	computational fluid dynamics;cubic function	Dongwook Lee;Hugues Faller;Adam Reyes	2017	J.

A proper choice of source points is still an important issue in the MFS. In this paper we derive a new merit function, namely the energy gap functional, whose minimum leads to the optimal distribution of source points. The new method can improve the accuracy of the MFS for solving the mixed boundary value problem as well as the Cauchy problem of the Laplace equation. The numerical tests confirm that the use of the optimal sources in the MFS performs well and the accuracy is increased.	moose file system	Fajie Wang;Chein-Shan Liu;Wenzhen Qu	2018	Appl. Math.

For the oscillatory second-order initial value problems of the form   q ″ +ω 2 q=f(q,q ′ )      q  ″   +   ω  2   q  =  f  (  q  ,   q  ′   )       , adapted Runge–Kutta–Nystrom methods (ARKN methods, in short notation) were investigated by several authors. In a wide range of physical applications from molecular dynamics to nonlinear wave propagation, an important class of the problems is Hamiltonian systems for which symplectic methods should be preferred. Hence it is quite natural to raise a question of the symplecticness for ARKN methods. In this paper we investigate the symplecticness conditions of ARKN methods for separable Hamiltonian systems. We conclude that there exist only one-stage explicit symplectic ARKN (SARKN, in short notation) methods under the symplecticness conditions of ARKN methods. The SARKN methods have a special form and the algebraic order cannot exceed 2. We also point out that no ARKN method can be symmetric. An explicit SARKN method of order two is proposed with the analysis of phase and stability properties. The numerical results accompanied show good performance for the new explicit symplectic algorithm in comparison with the popular symplectic methods in the scientific literature.	symplectic integrator	Wei Shi;Xinyuan Wu	2012	Computer Physics Communications	10.1016/j.cpc.2012.02.005	hamiltonian system;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;mathematics;symmetry;physics;quantum mechanics	ML	85.59170363177563	6.157502056901229	46500

The Helmholtz equation with variable coefficient models the wave phenomena. The scatterer is assumed to have a high index of refraction while at the same time it is very small in one of the dimensions. We show that if the index scales as O(1/h), where h is the thickness of the scatterer, then an approximate solution, based on perturbation analysis, can be obtained. The approximate solution consists of a leading order term plus a corrector, each of which solves an integral equation in two dimensions for a three-dimensional problem. We provide error analysis on the approximation. The approximate method can be viewed as an efficient computational approach since it can potentially greatly simplify scattering calculations. Numerical results provide an assessment of the accuracy of the approximate solution.	approximation algorithm;coefficient;computation;error analysis (mathematics);numerical method;perturbation theory;thickness (graph theory)	Shari Moskow;Fadil Santosa;J.

In this paper we design a wellbalanced numerical scheme for the one-dimensional shallow water magnetohydrodynamic system with topography, that resolves exactly a large range of steady states. Two variants are proposed with slightly different families of preserved steady states. They are obtained by a generalized hydrostatic reconstruction algorithm involving the magnetic field and with a cutoff parameter to remove singularities. The solver is positive in height and semi-discrete entropy satisfying, which ensures the robustness of the method.	algorithm;numerical analysis;semiconductor industry;solver;steady state;topography	François Bouchut;Xavier Lhébrard	2017	Numerische Mathematik	10.1007/s00211-017-0865-y	mathematical optimization;topography	AI	90.0662600991877	10.079405980115943	47350

The deformation theory of strain gradient plasticity, which introduces an internal material length scale, is used. It falls into the classical deformation theory of elasto-plasticity when this length scale equals zero. The method employs the idea by Milton and Serkov [J. Mech. Phys. Solids, 48 (2000), pp. 1259–1324] and other techniques for bounding effective energy. We derive two stress bounds which closely relate to the Reuss lower bound and the Hashin–Shtrikman upper bound for the energy. We then study numerically the dependence on the internal length scale of the magnitude of the stress and the region in the stress space determined by these two bounds in which the macro stress must lie. The results confirm the prediction made by Fleck and Willis [J. Mech. Phys. Solids, 52 (2004), pp. 1855–1888] for the macroscopic uniaxial response by differentiating their energy bounds.	gradient;hp 48 series;numerical analysis	Viet Ha Hoang	2009	SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics	10.1137/070700206	classical mechanics;calculus;geometry;infinitesimal strain theory;effective stress	ML	86.81701161249117	4.7285942594636925	47382

Such a result already existed for the corresponding implicit in time finite volume scheme, since it can be interpreted as a particular case of the space-time discontinuous Galerkin method but the technique of proof, used in that case, does not extend to explicit schemes. The general framework, recently developed to analyse the convergence rate of finite volume schemes for non linear scalar conservation laws, can not be used either, because it is not adapted for systems, even linear. In this article, we propose a new technique, which takes advantage of the linearity of the problem. The first step consists in controlling the approximation error ‖u−uh‖L2 by an expression of the form < νh, g > −2 < μh, gu >, where u is the exact solution, g is a particular smooth function, and μh, νh are some linear forms depending on the approximate solution uh. The second step consists in carefully estimating the error terms < μh, gu > and < νh, g >, by using uniform stability results for the discrete problem and regularity properties of the continuous solution.	approximation algorithm;approximation error;discontinuous galerkin method;finite volume method;rate of convergence	Jean-Paul Vila;Philippe Villedieu	2003	Numerische Mathematik	10.1007/s00211-002-0396-y	approximation error;mathematical analysis;numerical analysis;discontinuous galerkin method;calculus;space time;first-order logic;galerkin method;mathematics;geometry;linear system;rate of convergence;finite volume method;partial differential equation;numerical stability;algorithm;upwind scheme	Theory	87.00507178977814	13.688940519250412	47486

In XFEM scheme of SP(N) equations, the signed distance function is employed to accurately represent the internal tissue boundary, and then it is used to construct the enriched basis function of the finite element scheme. Therefore, the finite element calculation can be carried out without the time-consuming internal boundary mesh generation. Moreover, the required overly fine mesh conforming to the complex tissue boundary which leads to excess time cost can be avoided. XFEM conveniences its application to tissues with complex internal structure and improves the computational efficiency. Phantom and digital mouse experiments were carried out to validate the efficiency of the proposed method. Compared with standard finite element method and classical Monte Carlo (MC) method, the validation results show the merits and potential of the XFEM for optical imaging.	approximation;basis function;body tissue;experiment;extended finite element method;mesh generation;molecular imaging;monte carlo method;offset binary;optical imaging;phantoms, imaging;signature;spherical power:invlen:pt:eye.left:qn	Wei Li;Huangjian Yi;Qitan Zhang;Duofang Chen;Jimin Liang	2012		10.1155/2012/394374	normal distribution;computer simulation;mathematical optimization;simulation;extended finite element method;computer science;boundary knot method;theoretical computer science;finite element method;optical imaging;mathematics;molecular imaging;mixed finite element method;statistics;monte carlo method	Vision	94.36580216986215	7.992775481315357	47557

In this paper, the ghost effect system modeling the ghost effect phenomena for rarefied gas is investigated. It is shown that any strong solution of the Cauchy problem moves along the direction from the low temperature part to the high part at least on a nonzero measure domain for any time. This also holds for the initial boundary value problem with additional boundary conditions. The global well-posedness of the strong solution is further obtained for the 2 dimensional ghost effect system under some conditions on the temperature, while the initial velocity could be arbitrarily large.	effect system;ghost;systems modeling;velocity (software development);well-posed problem	Feimin Huang;Wenke Tan	2017	SIAM J.

The material has been studied by considering its representative volume element (RVE) which entails all the geometric and constitutive information of the micro-structure. First, the formulation of the elastostatic problem governing the non-linear (large deformation and non-linear elastic) behavior of the structure of the RVE is presented. The RVE is subject to loading paths that produce  uniform macroscopic strains . In this way it has been possible to use an homogenization procedure in order to simulate the overall behavior of the material, i.e. its constitutive tensor, at each point of the equilibrium path. Then, a macro failure surface has been defined as the locus of the points, in the macroscopic stretches space, corresponding to the loss of positivity of the macroscopic fourth order constitutive tensor in terms of the Biot stress [Encyclopedia of Physics, vol. 3(3), Springer-Verlag, Berlin]. Further, a micro-failure surface is defined as the locus of the points, in the overall stretches space, corresponding to the first critical point detected along the equilibrium path which can be characterized by an eigenmode compatible with the boundary conditions. Finally, a representative volume element, schematized by plane rods with strongly non-linear elastic constitutive behavior, is considered and the corresponding micro- and macro-failure surfaces are obtained in order to validate the proposed methodology.

The method is based on a local polynomial annihilation technique and can be characterized by its convergence to zero for any value away from discontinuities. The method is numerically cost efficient and entirely independent of any specific shape or complexity of boundaries. Application of the minmod function to the edge detection method of various orders ensures a high rate of convergence away from the discontinuities while reducing the inherent oscillations near the discontinuities. It further enables distinction of jump discontinuities from steep gradients, even in instances where only sparse nonuniform data is available. These results are successfully demonstrated in both one and two dimensions.	cost efficiency;curve fitting;edge detection;gradient;numerical analysis;polynomial;rate of convergence;sparse matrix	Rick Archibald;Anne Gelb;Jungho Yoon	2005	SIAM J.

The method of analysis is illustrated through case studies.	nonlinear programming	Magdy A. El-Tawil;Noha A. Al-Mulla	2010	Trans.

2486e7296d8595d3c3d22d8fe3f7e5fdc1c92d9c	high-order multi-dimensional limiting strategy with subcell resolution i. two-dimensional mixed meshes		Abstract The present paper deals with a new improvement of hierarchical multi-dimensional limiting process for resolving the subcell distribution of high-order methods on two-dimensional mixed meshes. From previous studies, the multi-dimensional limiting process (MLP) was hierarchically extended to the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method and the flux reconstruction/correction procedure via reconstruction (FR/CPR) method on simplex meshes. It was reported that the hierarchical MLP ( h MLP) shows several remarkable characteristics such as the preservation of the formal order-of-accuracy in smooth region and a sharp capturing of discontinuities in an efficient and accurate manner. At the same time, it was also surfaced that such characteristics are valid only on simplex meshes, and numerical Gibbs–Wilbraham oscillations are concealed in subcell distribution in the form of high-order polynomial modes. Subcell Gibbs–Wilbraham oscillations become potentially unstable near discontinuities and adversely affect numerical solutions in the sense of cell-averaged solutions as well as subcell distributions. In order to overcome the two issues, the behavior of the h MLP on mixed meshes is mathematically examined, and the simplex-decomposed P1 -projected MLP condition and smooth extrema detector are derived. Secondly, a troubled-boundary detector is designed by analyzing the behavior of computed solutions across boundary-edges. Finally, h MLP_BD is proposed by combining the simplex-decomposed P1 -projected MLP condition and smooth extrema detector with the troubled-boundary detector. Through extensive numerical tests, it is confirmed that the h MLP_BD scheme successfully eliminates subcell oscillations and provides reliable subcell distributions on two-dimensional triangular grids as well as mixed grids, while preserving the expected order-of-accuracy in smooth region.	polygon mesh	Hojun You;Chongam Kim	2018	J.

From the quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity equation, by using methods of multiple scales and perturbation expansions, a (  2+1     2  +  1       ) dimensional nonlinear Zakharov–Kuznetsov–Burgers equation is derived in describing the evolution of Rossby wave amplitude. The effects of generalized beta, the horizontal component of Coriolis parameter and the dissipation are presented from the Zakharov–Kuznetsov–Burgers equation. We also obtain the classical solitary solution of the Zakharov–Kuznetsov equation when the dissipation is absent by elliptic function expansion method, and the complete Coriolis force effect can be seen by the solution. But the method is failed to Zakharov–Kuznetsov-Burgers equation, therefore, we use the efficient homotopy perturbation method to solve the Zakharov–Kuznetsov–Burgers equation.	like button	Ruigang Zhang;Liangui Yang;Jian Song;Hongli Yang	2017	Computers & Mathematics with Applications	10.1016/j.camwa.2017.02.036	classical mechanics;omega equation;inertial wave;mathematical analysis;homotopy analysis method;homotopy perturbation method;calculus;mathematics;kelvin wave;rossby number;rossby wave	Robotics	84.95027932598555	5.792013334821903	48236

The fibers are treated as one-dimensional Kirchhoff rods that resist stretching, bending, and twisting, within the generalized IB framework. We perform a careful numerical comparison against experiments on single fibers performed by S. G. Mason and co-workers, who categorized the fiber dynamics into several distinct orbit classes. We show that the orbit class may be determined using a single dimensionless parameter for low Reynolds flows. Lastly, we simulate dilute suspensions containing up to hundreds of fibers using a distributedmemory computer cluster. These simulations serve as a stepping stone for studying more complex suspension dynamics including non-dilute suspensions and aggregation of fibers (also known as flocculation).	algorithm;categorization;complexity class;computer cluster;experiment;geosynchronous orbit;image scaling;immersed boundary method;kirchhoff's circuit laws;kirchhoff's theorem;mason;molecular orbital;numerical analysis;optical fiber;penalty method;reynolds-averaged navier–stokes equations;scalability;semiconductor industry;simulation;solver;stepping level	Jeffrey K.

Emphasis is laid on the performance evaluation of an adaptive POD procedure, with respect to the solution obtained with the classical 4D-Var (full model), and POD 4D-Var data assimilation. Despite some perturbation factors characterizing the model dynamics, the adaptive POD scheme presents better numerical robustness compared to the other methods, and provides accurate results.	adaptive grammar;basis function;computer simulation;data assimilation;experiment;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;performance evaluation;principal component analysis;robustness (computer science);scheme;snapshot (computer storage);spatial variability	Gabriel Dimitriu;Narcisa C.

The answer to this question is important, since some published numerical studies use the time DQs, whereas other numerical studies do not. The criterion used in this paper to answer this question is the optimality of the convergence rate of the error of the reduced order model with respect to the number of POD basis functions. Since to the best of our knowledge a definition of the optimality of the convergence rate is not available, we propose one in Definition 3.1 in this paper. Two cases are considered: the no_DQ case, in which the snapshot DQs are not used, and the DQ case, in which the snapshot DQs are used. For each case, two types of POD bases are used: the $L^2$-POD basis, in which the basis is generated in the $L^2$-norm, and the $H^1$-POD basis, in which the basi...	principal component analysis;snapshot (computer storage)	Traian Iliescu;Zhu Wang	2014	SIAM J.

We use the theory of semigroups in conjunction with spectral decompositions of their generators in order to derive detailed representation formulas for shooting operators in function space and their adjoints. A spectral truncation approach delivers a self-adjoint indefinite Newton--Picard preconditioner for the saddle-point system of optimality conditions in function space. We show that this preconditioner leads to convergence in a function space fixed-point iteration. Moreover, we discuss that this preconditioner can be approximated well by a two-grid approach. We address some implementation issues and present numerical results for three-dimensional instationary problems with more than 100,000,000 degrees of freedom.	musicbrainz picard;newton;newton's method;optimal control;parabolic antenna;preconditioner	Falk M.

One approach to deriving numerical methods based upon these ideas leads to Bruno and Reitich’s generalization [Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh Sect. A, 122 (1992), pp. 317–340] of Rayleigh and Rice’s classical algorithm giving the “method of variation of boundaries” which is very fast and accurate within its domain of applicability. Treating problems outside this domain (e.g., boundary perturbations which are large and/or rough) led Nicholls and Reitich [Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh Sect. A, 131 (2001), pp. 1411–1433] to design the “transformed field expansions” (TFE) method, and the rigorous numerical analysis of these recursions is the subject of the current work. This analysis is based upon analyticity estimates for the TFE expansions coupled to the convergence of Fourier–Legendre Galerkin methods. This powerful and flexible analysis is extended to a wide range of problems including those governed by Laplace and Helmholtz equations, and the equations of traveling free-surface ideal fluid flow.	algorithm;galerkin method;numerical analysis;perturbation theory;rayleigh–ritz method;recursion	David P.

The closures are based on a diagonal-norm summation-by-parts (SBP) framework, thereby guaranteeing linear stability on piecewise curvilinear multi-block grids and entropy stability for nonlinear equations that support a convex extension. The new closures are developed by enriching conventional approaches with additional boundary closure stencils and non-equidistant grid distributions at the domain boundaries. Greatly improved accuracy is achieved near the boundaries, as compared with traditional diagonal norm operators of the same order. The superior accuracy of the new optimal diagonal-norm SBP operators is demonstrated for linear hyperbolic systems in one dimension and for the nonlinear compressible Euler equations in two dimensions.	euler;finite difference;nonlinear system;sbp	Ken Mattsson;Martin Almquist;Mark H.

The pr econditioner is defined by means of a Broyden-type rank-one update of a given initial p reconditioner, at each nonlinear iteration, as described in [5] where convergence properties of the scheme are theoretically proved. This acceleration is employed in the solution of the nonlinear system of algebraic equations arising from the Finit e Element discretization of two-phase flow model in porous media. We report numerical res ults of the application of this approach when the initial preconditioner is chosen t o be the incomplete LU decomposition of the Jacobian matrix at the initial nonlinear stage. It is shown that the proposed acceleration reduces the number of linear iterati ons needed to achieve convergence. Also, the cost of computing the preconditioner is reduced as this operation is made only once at the beginning of the Newton iteration.	algebraic equation;approximation;broyden–fletcher–goldfarb–shanno algorithm;central processing unit;conjugate gradient method;discretization;fixed-point iteration;incomplete lu factorization;iterative method;jacobian matrix and determinant;krylov subspace;lu decomposition;linear system;newton;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;preconditioner;quasi-newton method;secant method;solver;two-phase commit protocol;two-phase locking	Luca Bergamaschi;Rafael Bru;Angeles Martinez;Mario Putti	2012	Advances in Engineering Software	10.1016/j.advengsoft.2010.10.011	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;quasi-newton method;calculus;mathematics;two-phase flow;porous medium	HPC	84.46066804519418	21.182881988151316	48848

The additional parameters in the skewing function permit the composite radial basis function to more flexibly adapt its shape to the data. We present several examples that illustrate the utility of sRBF representations for both the overdetermined data fitting problem and the data interpolation problem. We derive conditions under which skew perturbations of positive definite interpolation matrices remain positive definite. We observe that the sRBFs are particularly effective for producing uniform approximations and fitting jump discontinuities. We present an application to the time-series prediction of the maximum wind intensity of a hurricane and outline future work in image processing. The resulting sRBF models have reduced order, improved accuracy, and interpolation matrices with lower condition numbers.	approximation;approximation algorithm;authorization;command & conquer:yuri's revenge;condition number;curve fitting;dual ec drbg;gaussian (software);image processing;interpolation;mixture model;nl (complexity);nonlinear system;numerical aperture;radial (radio);radial basis function;time series;turing test;ut-vpn	Arta A.

6e3f51c99ae9ce26540dff9432cf1d1633a1ee4b	two-step perfectly matched layer for arbitrary-order pseudo-spectral analytical time-domain methods		Abstract Numerical simulation of an electrodynamic system in empty space requires the implementation of open boundary conditions (BC) to terminate the solution of Maxwell’s equations on the boundaries of the computational domain. The Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) has become the method of choice for open BC with wave equations, as it is straightforward and relatively easy to implement, and offers very efficient and user-adjustable absorption rates. PMLs are most often employed with the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) algorithm, which in its most common implementation offers second-order accuracy in space and time on Cartesian grids. Yet, simulations (including some class of electromagnetic Particle-In-Cell simulations) that require higher precision may resort to higher-order Maxwell solvers employing extended finite-difference stencils, or even to pseudo-spectral Maxwell solvers, for which a general, versatile and efficient formulation of the PML has been missing so far. In this paper, we propose a novel “two-step” formulation of the PML that is simple, very versatile and can be used as is with any Maxwell solver. In particular, it is applicable to a large class of Maxwell solvers including the arbitrary-order Pseudo-Spectral Analytical Time-Domain (PSATD) solver, which offers arbitrarily low numerical dispersion when increasing solver order and becomes dispersion-free at infinite order. Analysis and numerical simulations demonstrate that the new formulation is as efficient as the standard PML formulation, both for the FDTD and the PSATD implementations.

The radiative transfer equation (RTE) occurs in a wide variety of applications. In this paper, we study discrete-ordinate discontinuous Galerkin methods for solving the RTE. The numerical methods are formed in two steps. In the first step, the discrete ordinate technique is applied to discretize the integral operator for the angular variable, resulting in a semi-discrete hyperbolic system. In the second step, the spatial discontinuous Galerkin method is applied to discretize the semi-discrete system. A stability and error analysis is performed on the numerical methods. Some numerical examples are included to demonstrate the convergence behavior of the methods.	angularjs;discontinuous galerkin method;discrete system;discretization;error analysis (mathematics);semiconductor industry	Weimin Han;Jianguo Huang;Joseph A.

On coarse grids, these high-contrast jumps resemble shocks rather than their true viscous profiles, which could lead to issues in the numerical approximation of their underlying dynamics. In many cases, the equations of motion emit traveling wave solutions which can be used to represent the viscous profiles analytically. The traveling wave solution can be thought of as a lower dimensional representation of the motion, since they contain information from the evolution equation, but are constant along certain time-space curves. Using a parameterized basis involving the traveling waves, along with the sparse + low-energy decompositions found in imaging sciences, we propose an approximation to viscous conservation laws which separates the coarse smooth component from the sharp fine one. Our method provides an appropriate approximation to the solution on a coarse grid, thereby accurately under-resolving the viscous profile. This is similar to the philosophy of shock capturing methods, in the sense that we want to capture the viscous front without needing to resolve the profile. Theoretical results on the consistency of our method are shown in general. We provide several computational examples for convex and non-convex fluxes.	approximation;approximation algorithm;computation;contour line;emoticon;ibm notes;list of code lyoko characters;low-rank approximation;numerical analysis;scott continuity;shock capturing method;sparse matrix;xfig	Thomas Y.

The splitting algorithm controls the consistency error by maintaining small vortex core sizes. Routine analysis will show that the core spreading method coupled to this splitting process is convergent in LP spaces. Analysis of the linearized residual operator establishes the uniform convergence of this method when the exact flow field is known. A sequence of examples demonstrates the sensitivity of the method to numerical parameters as the computed solution converges to the exact solution. These experimental results agree with the linear convergence theory. Finally, .direct comparisons between the traditional random walk vortex method and the new method indicate that the new method has several advantages while requiring the same computational effort.

The method is based on the linearization of ordinary differential equations in nonoverlapping intervals and results in linear constant-coefficients ordinary differential equations which can be integrated analytically, thus yielding piecewise analytical solutions. By imposing continuity conditions at the end points of each interval plus a smoothness condition at the common end point of two adjacent intervals, a global smooth solution is obtained. The accuracy of the globally smooth locally-analytical method is assessed by comparisons with exact and approximate solutions of several singularly perturbed problems with internal and boundary layers. It is shown that the smooth locally-analytical method is more precise than second-order accurate finite difference discretizations. It is also shown that the accuracy of the smooth locally-analytical method depends on the kind of nonlinearity and inhomogeneities of singularly perturbed ordinary differential equations, but is always higher than that of exponentially-fitted techniques based on the local solution of advection–diffusion operators. 2004 Elsevier Inc.

This method is appealing for parallel computers. Also we show that how this method can be implemented for linear systems that arises from a domain decomposition method for partial differential equations.

The need for iterative procedures arises, since hardly any sparsity occurs in the linear system of interpolation equations. This paper considers a generalization of the iterative algorithm developed by Beatson, Goodsell and Powell. A proof of convergence of this method is given. It depends mainly on the remark that all the changes to the thin plate spline coeecients reduce a certain semi-norm of the diierence between the required interpolant and the current approximation. The analysis applies also to analogous algorithms for other radial basis functions.	algorithm;approximation;iterative method;linear system;powell's method;radial (radio);radial basis function;semiconductor industry;sparse matrix;spline interpolation;thin plate spline	A.

We prove the existence, uniqueness and regularity of solution for the direct problem by using the fixed point theorem. The stability of inverse convection coefficient problem is obtained based on the regularity of solution for the direct problem and some generalized Gronwall’s inequalities.

Two methods are proposed to solve this equation. In both methods the spatial part of the equations is discretized using a high order spectral element method, based on assuming that the neutron flux can be expanded in terms of the modified Dubiner’s polynomials. For the time discretization of the equations two different strategies have been considered. For the first a finite differences one-step implicit method has been used and the other method is based on a modal expansion of the flux in terms of the dominant Lambda modes of the reactor core. The performance of both methods has been tested for an hypothetical transient in a 2-dimensional VVER 440 reactor. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Such a class of nonconforming elements has been introduced recently in Achchab et al. (2015). Here, based on a rectangular mesh, it is used for the approximate solution of a planar elasticity problem. It is shown that this family passes the patch-test, and that by suitably adding some orthogonality conditions, on a general class of enrichment functions, we can derive higher order consistency error estimates. Our general theoretical results, see Theorems 4.1 and 4.2, unify, simplify and extend a number of existing works on the improvement of the order of consistency error. Numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate that our method is optimal for various Lame parameter μ , shear modulus λ and locking free when the Poisson parameter ν approaches close to 0.5.	elasticity (data store)	Boujemâa Achchab;Abdellatif Agouzal;Allal Guessab;Yassine Zaim	2019	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2018.09.059	mathematical analysis;mathematical optimization;shear modulus;extended family;elasticity (economics);mathematics;poisson distribution;orthogonality	Logic	89.56381773733166	12.857524948705723	50575

bb2d27223d1b700cd225d112c133661c95389c02	a note on multilevel based error estimation		By employing the infinite multilevel representation of the residual, we derive computable bounds to estimate the distance of finite element approximations to the solution of the Poisson equation. If the finite element approximation is a Galerkin solution, the derived error estimator coincides with the standard element and edge based estimator. If Galerkin orthogonality is not satisfied, then the discrete residual additionally appears in terms of the BPX preconditioner. As a by-product of the present analysis, conditions are derived such that the hierarchical error estimation is reliable and efficient.	approximation;computable function;computation;finite element method;galerkin method;preconditioner	Helmut Harbrecht;Reinhold Schneider	2016	Comput.

In addition, surface tension introduces nonlinear terms with high order spatial derivatives into the interface dynamics. This makes the spatial discretization even more difficult and, at the same time, imposes a severe time step constraint for stable explicit time integration methods. A proof of the convergence of a reformulated boundary integral method for two-density fluid interfaces with surface tension is presented. The method is based on a scheme introduced by Hou, Lowengrub and Shelley [ J. Comp. Phys. 114 (1994), pp. 312–338] to remove the high order stability constraint or stiffness. Some numerical filtering is applied carefully at certain places in the discretization to guarantee stability. The key of the proof is to identify the most singular terms of the method and to show, through energy estimates, that these terms balance one another. The analysis is at a time continuous-space discrete level but a fully discrete case for a simple Hele-Shaw interface is also studied. The time discrete analysis shows that the high order stiffness is removed and also provides an estimate of how the CFL constraint depends on the curvature and regularity of the solution. The robustness of the method is illustrated with several numerical examples. A numerical simulation of an unstably stratified two-density interfacial flow shows the roll-up of the interface; the computations proceed up to a time where the interface is about to pinch off and trapped bubbles of fluid are formed. The method remains stable even in the full nonlinear regime of motion. Another application of the method shows the process of drop formation in a falling single fluid.	boundary element method;cliff shaw;computation;computer simulation;courant–friedrichs–lewy condition;discretization;keyboard technology;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations	Héctor D.

This model is commonly used in hydraulic engineering to describe dynamic behavior of the unsteady flow in a river for shallow water when the flow variations are not important. In order to stabilize and regulate the system, we propose a proportional and integral boundary controller. Contrary to many physical systems, we end up with a nondissipative closed-loop system with noncollocated actuators and sensors. We show that the closed-loop system is a Riesz spectral system and generates an analytic semigroup. Then, we shall be able to assign the spectrum of the closed-loop system in the open left half-plane to ensure its exponential stability as well as the output regulation independently of any known or unknown constant perturbation. These results are illustrated by several numerical examples.	numerical analysis;numerical method;sensor;time complexity	Boumediène Chentouf;Jun-Min Wang	2008	SIAM J.

The key to achieving high parallel efficiency in this type of computation is to divide the spectrum into several intervals in a way that leads to optimal use of computational resources. We discuss strategies for dividing the spectrum. Our strategies make use of a eigenvalue distribution profile that can be estimated through inertia counts and cubic spline fitting. We also make use of a simple cost model that describes the cost of computing k eigenvalues within a single interval in terms of the asymptotic cost of sparse matrix factorization and triangular substitutions. Several computational experiments are performed to demonstrate the effect of spectrum division on the overall performance of both multiple shift-invert Lanczos and the contour integral based method. We also show parallel scalability of both approaches in the strong and weak sense. Our experiments indicate that multiple shift-invert Lanczos is generally more efficient than the contour integral based spectral projection method when implemented properly.	3d projection;analysis of algorithms;computation;computational complexity theory;computational resource;cubic hermite spline;cubic function;experiment;lanczos resampling;scalability;smoothing spline;sparse matrix;speedup;spline (mathematics);triangular matrix	Hasan Metin Aktulga;Lin Lin;Christopher Haine;Esmond G.

This theory has originally been developed for the simulation of large deformation processes including the folding and kinking of multi-layered visco-elastic rock (Mühlhaus et al. [1],[2]). The orientation of slip planes in the context of crystallographic slip is determined by the normal vector — the director — of these surfaces. The model is applied to simulate anisotropic mantle convection. We compare the evolution of flow patterns , Nusselt number and director orientations for isotropic and anisotropic rheologies. In the simulations we utilize two different finite element methodologies: The Lagrangian Integration Point Method Moresi et al [8] and an Eulerian formulation, which we implemented into the finite element based pde solver Fastflo (www.cmis.csiro.au/Fastflo/). The reason for utilizing two different finite element codes was firstly to study the influence of an anisotropic power law rheology which currently is not implemented into the Lagrangian Integration point scheme [8]and secondly to study the numerical performance of Eulerian (Fastflo)and Lagrangian integration schemes [8]. It turned out that whereas in the Lagrangian method the Nusselt number vs time plot reached only a quasi steady state where the Nusselt number oscillates around a steady state value the Eulerian scheme reaches exact steady states and produces a high degree of alignment (director orientation locally orthogonal to velocity vector almost everywhere in the computational domain). In the simulations emergent anisotropy was strongest in terms of modulus contrast in the up and down-welling plumes. Mechanisms for anisotropic material behavior in the mantle dynamics context are discussed by Christensen [3]. The dominant mineral phases in the mantle generally do not exhibit strong elastic anisotropy but they still may be oriented by the convective flow. Thus viscous anisotropy (the main focus of this paper) may or may not correlate with elastic or seismic anisotropy.	code;elastic net regularization;emergence;finite element method;mantle;modulus robot;normal (geometry);numerical analysis;simulation;solver;steady state;velocity (software development)	Hans-B.

The result is constructive and local, and gives a method for determining the coefficient at a boundary point from measurements in a small neighborhood. The proofs work with the nonlinear equation directly instead of being based on linearization. In the complex valued case we employ complex geometrical optics type solutions based on p-harmonic exponentials, while for the real case we use p-harmonic functions first introduced by Wolff.	coefficient;laplacian matrix;nonlinear system	Mikko Salo;Xiao Zhong	2012	SIAM J.

f8939eaa3bc062048d94bac1adcc09084ad89620	a two-level overlapping hybrid domain decomposition method for eigenvalue problems		In this paper, we present a two-level overlapping hybrid domain decomposition method for solving the large scale discrete elliptic eigenvalue problems. In order to eliminate the components in the orthogonal complement space of the eigenspace, we construct a parallel preconditioner for the eigenvalue problem in fine space. After one coarse space correction in each iteration, we get the error reduction as $gamma=c(1-Cfrac{delta}{H})$, where $C$ is a constant independent of the mesh size $h$ and the diameter of subdomains $H$, $delta$ is the overlapping size among the subdomains, and $crightarrow1$ decreasingly as $Hrightarrow0$, which means the greater the number of subdomains, the better the convergence rate. Different from other numerical algorithms in the literature, we do not need any assumptions between $H$ and $h$. Numerical results supporting our theory are given.	domain decomposition methods	Wei Wang;Xuejun Xu	2018	SIAM J.

First, we summarize the known forms of the solution of a classic acoustic signaling problem based on the linearized theory. Next, we review several weakly-nonlinear models, all of which admit traveling wave solutions (TWSs) in the form of classical Taylor shocks, and note some of their features. We then consider traveling waves under the fully-nonlinear theory of gas dynamics, and derive a new third-order equation of motion valid for arbitrary Mach number values. Focusing on the special cases of (a) inviscid, thermally-conducting, and (b) viscous, non-thermally-conducting (i.e., strictly adiabatic) perfect gases, exact and/or numerical solutions of this nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE) are determined, asymptotic expressions presented, and critical values of the physical parameters identified. It is shown that, in addition to kinks, the fully-nonlinear theory allows for discontinuous solutions (i.e., shocks) and solutions that exhibit acceleration waves.	acoustic cryptanalysis	Ivan C.

The key issue is to understand the interaction between two small length-scales: the interfacial thickness ε and the mesh size of spatial discretization δ. Depending on their relative sizes, we obtain results in the framework of Γ-convergence for the (i) subcritical (ε δ), (ii) critical (ε ∼ δ), and (iii) supercritical (ε δ) cases. The first case leads to the same area functional as the spatially continuous case while the third gives the same result as that coming from a ferromagnetic spin energy. The critical case can be regarded as an interpolation between the two.	approximation;discretization;finite difference method;interpolation;thickness (graph theory);γ-convergence	Andrea Braides;Nung Kwan Yip	2012	SIAM J.

Then, a unified conservative gas-kinetic scheme is developed for the viscous flow computation in the moving grid system in the Eulerian space. Due to the coupling between the grid velocity and the overall solution algorithm, the Eulerian and Lagrangian methods become two limiting cases in the current gas-kinetic method. A fully conservative formulation can be obtained even in the Lagrangian limit. The moving grid method extends the applicable regime of the gas-kinetic scheme to the flows with free surface or moving boundaries, such as dam break problem and airfoil oscillations. In order to further increase the robustness of the moving grid method, similar to the arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) method, a conservative adaptive grid technique is also implemented in the current method to redistribute the mesh concentration to the rapid variational flow region and remedy the distorted moving mesh due to the coupling between grid velocity and fluid speed. Many numerical examples from incompressible flow to the supersonic shock interaction are presented. The test cases verify the accuracy and robustness of the unified moving grid gas-kinetic method. 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

87932b302e952616820b48180d80f38e0efffe5f	adapted kussmaul formulation of acoustic scattering problems: an overview	integral equation;boundary integral equation;acoustic scattering;integral operator;acoustic waves;potential theory	Abstract   Problems of exterior acoustic scattering may be conveniently formulated by means of boundary integral equations. The problem seeks to find a wave function which gives velocity potential profile, pressure density profile, etc. of the acoustic wave at points in space. At the background of the formulations are two theories viz. (Helmholtz) Potential theory and the Green's representation formula. Potential theory gives rise to the so-called indirect formulation and the Green's representation formula to the direct formulations. Classical boundary integral formulations fail at the eigenfrequencies of the interior domain. That is, if a solution is sought of the exterior problem by first solving a homogeneous boundary integral equation, one is inevitably led to the conclusion that these homogeneous boundary equations have nontrivial solutions at certain wave-numbers which are the eigenvalues of the corresponding interior problem. At lower wave-numbers, these eigenfrequencies are thinly distributed but the higher the wave-number, the denser it becomes. This is a well-known drawback for both time-harmonic acoustics and elastodynamics. This is not a physical difficulty but arises entirely as a result of a deficiency in the integral equation is representation. Why then use It? The use has many advantages notably in that the meshing region is reduced from the infinite domain exterior to the body to its finite surface. This created the need for some robust formulations. A proof of the Kussmaul [1] formulation is presented. The formulation has a hypersingular kernel in the integral operator, which creates a havoc in computation (e.g., ill conditioning). The hyper-singularity can be avoided [2], as a result a new formulation is proposed. This paper presents a broad overview of the Adapted Kussmaul Formulation (AKF).	acoustic cryptanalysis	Saiful I.

Models for these processes should account for gaseous transport in a range of flow regimes, from continuum flow to free molecular or Knudsen flow, and for chemical reactions at the wafer surface. We develop a kinetic transport and reaction model whose mathematical representation is a system of transient linear Boltzmann equations. In addition to time, a deterministic numerical solution of this system of kinetic equations requires the discretization of both position and velocity spaces, each two-dimensional for 2-D/2-D or each three-dimensional for 3-D/3-D simulations. Discretizing the velocity space by a spectral Galerkin method approximates each Boltzmann equation by a system of transient linear hyperbolic conservation laws. The classical choice of basis functions based on Hermite polynomials leads to dense coefficient matrices in this system. We use a collocation basis instead that directly yields diagonal coefficient matrices, allowing for more convenient simulations in higher dimensions. The systems of conservation laws are solved using the discontinuous Galerkin finite element method. First, we simulate chemical vapor deposition in both two and three dimensions in typical micron scale features as application example. Second, stability and convergence of the numerical method are demonstrated numerically in two and three dimensions. Third, we present parallel performance results which indicate that the implementation of the method possesses very good scalability on a distributed-memory cluster with a high-performance Myrinet interconnect.	basis function;central processing unit;chemical vapor deposition;coefficient;collocation;courant–friedrichs–lewy condition;discontinuous galerkin method;discretization;distributed memory;finite element method;hermite polynomials;integrated circuit;numerical method;numerical partial differential equations;physical vapor deposition;polynomial;scalability;simulation;triune continuum paradigm;vacuum deposition;velocity (software development);wafer (electronics)	Matthias K.

b13a23cd642f7a9c6ea9aff865dda087f97942ac	fast automated airborne electromagnetic data interpretation using parallelized particle swarm optimization		Abstract A parallelized implementation of the particle swarm optimization algorithm is developed. We use the optimization procedure to speed up a previously published algorithm for airborne electromagnetic data interpretation. This algorithm is the only parametrized automated procedure for extracting the three-dimensionally varying geometrical parameters of conductors embedded in a resistive environment, such as igneous and metamorphic terranes. When compared to the original algorithm, the new optimization procedure is faster by two orders of magnitude (factor of 100). Synthetic model tests show that for the chosen system architecture and objective function, the particle swarm optimization approach depends very weakly on the rate of communication of the processors. Optimal wall-clock times are obtained using three processors. The increased performance means that the algorithm can now easily be used for fast routine interpretation of airborne electromagnetic surveys consisting of several anomalies, as is displayed by a test on MEGATEM field data collected at the Chibougamau site, Quebec.	airborne ranger;mathematical optimization;parallel computing;particle swarm optimization	Jacques K.

09cacdd40cd33f15b06b743c68c8c4b0cc929030	iterative methods for the solution of a singular control formulation of a gmwb pricing problem	93c20	Discretized singular control problems in finance result in highly nonlinear algebraic equations which must be solved at each timestep. We consider a singular stochastic control problem arising in pricing a Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit (GMWB), where the underlying asset is assumed to follow a jump diffusion process. We use a scaled direct control formulation of the singular control problem and examine the conditions required to ensure that a fast fixed point policy iteration scheme converges. Our methods take advantage of the special structure of the GMWB problem in order to obtain a rapidly convergent iteration. The direct control method has a scaling parameter which must be set by the user. We give estimates for bounds on the scaling parameter so that convergence can be expected in the presence of round-off error. Example computations verify that these estimates are of the correct order. Finally, we compare the scaled direct control formulation to a formulation based on an improved version of the penalty method. We show that the scaled direct control method has some advantages over the penalty method.	algebraic equation;computation;discretization;fixed point (mathematics);image scaling;iteration;iterative method;linear algebra;markov decision process;nonlinear system;penalty method;round-off error;stochastic control	Y.

A two-level domain decomposition method is reported in this investigation to devise a linear solver for the large-scale system in the Galerkin spectral stochastic finite element method (SSFEM). In particular, a two-level scalable preconditioner is introduced in order to iteratively solve the largescale linear system in the intrusive SSFEM using an iterative substructuring based domain decomposition solver. The implementation of the algorithm involves solving a local problem on each subdomain that constructs the local part of the preconditioner and a coarse problem that propagates information globally among the subdomains.

An algorithm is introduced to rearrange edges in the graph representation of the DAE in order to resolve cycles. The algorithm comprises a method to detect cycles of linear equations in the bipartite graph and to rearrange the cycle nodes by substituting equations. The incidence structure of the cycle changes, which can lead to a dissection of cycles. As an effect, constant variables can be evaluated or implicit constraints can be revealed and thus singularities prevented. For some models, this is essential to solve the system. Furthermore, the performance can be increased because the number of necessary equations needed to calculate the state derivatives is reduced or large systems of equations are split into various smaller ones. This also helps parallelization as it alleviates bottlenecks. The depicted algorithm was developed using the DAE derived from Modelica models and the algorithm is implemented in the OpenModelica Compiler (OMC).	algorithm;bottleneck (software);compiler;differential algebraic equation;graph (abstract data type);incidence matrix;linear equation;openmodelica;parallel computing;preprocessor;simulation	Volker Waurich;Ines Gubsch;Christian Schubert;Marcus Walther	2014		10.1145/2666202.2666203	discrete mathematics;computer science;theoretical computer science;algorithm	HPC	98.07515957626015	9.377059724549406	53010

5b4c973928526c1105e09f6924d33096d628927a	a simple method for matrix-valued coefficient elliptic equations with sharp-edged interfaces	symmetric positive definite;elliptic equation with matrix valued coefficients;sharp edged interface;traditional finite element method;body fitting grids	Keywords: Traditional finite element method Elliptic equation with matrix-valued coefficients Body-fitting grids Sharp-edged interface Symmetric positive definite a b s t r a c t The traditional finite element method has a number of nice properties, and thus it is highly desired for matrix-valued coefficient elliptic equations with sharp-edged interfaces. However , its efficient implementation with body-fitting grids for such problems is highly non-trivial. In this paper, we propose a simple finite element method with body-fitting grids based on semi-Cartesian grid, which makes its implementation fairly straightforward, even for complicated geometry. All possible situations that the interface cuts the grid are considered. Further, the symmetry and positive definiteness of the resulting matrix are ensured for positive definite coefficients. Numerical experiments show that it is second order accurate in the L 1 norm and numerically very stable. Elliptic interface problems arise naturally in a wide variety of applications, especially problems with multiphysics/mul-tiscale features. Therefore, its efficient numerical solution is of immense practical interest, and has received considerable interest in the past decades. In the literature, there are a large number of methods for solving such problems, e.g., immersed interface method (IIM), boundary condition capturing method (BCCM), matched interface and boundary method (MIBM), immersed finite element method (IFEM), nontraditional finite element method (NFEM) and finite element method using a Cartesian grid with added nodes (FEMCGAN), which we briefly review below. The IIM, developed in [1], incorporates the interface conditions for the solution and conormal derivative, i.e., ½u – 0 and b @u @n Â Ã – 0, directly into the finite difference stencil. The resulting linear system is sparse, but neither symmetric nor positive definite, which calls for fast iterative methods. In [2], a fast iterative method was developed for constant coefficient problems with the interface conditions ½u ¼ 0 and b @u @n Â Ã – 0, where non-body-fitting Cartesian grids are used and interfaces are not necessarily aligned with element edges. Numerical experiments indicate that the conforming and nonconforming versions respectively achieve second-order and first-order accuracy in the L 1 norm. For an updated overview of the method and its diverse applications, we refer to [3]. The BCCM [4] uses the ghost fluid method [5] to capture the boundary conditions. It is robust and simple to implement, and admits rigorous convergence proof via a variational interpretation [6]. It has been sped up by a multigrid method [7].

Feng and M. Neilan, J. Scient. Comp., DOI 10.1007/s10915-008-9221-9, 2008]. In this approach, the second-order fully nonlinear Monge–Ampère equation is approximated by the fourth order quasilinear equation −εΔ2uε + det D2uε = f . It was proved in [X. Feng, Trans. AMS, submitted] that the solution uε converges to the unique convex viscosity solution u0 of the Dirichlet problem for the Monge–Ampère equation. This result then opens a door for constructing convergent finite element methods for the fully nonlinear second-order equations, a task which has been impracticable before. The goal of this paper is threefold. First, we develop a family of Hermann–Miyoshi-type mixed finite element methods for approximating the solution uε of the regularized fourth-order problem, which computes simultaneously uε and the moment tensor σε := D2uε. Second, we derive error estimates, which track explicitly the dependence of the error constants on the parameter ε, for the errors uε − uh and σ0 − σε h. Finally, we present a detailed numerical study on the rates of convergence in terms of powers of ε for the error u0 −uh and σε −σε h, and numerically examine what is the “best” mesh size h in relation to ε in order to achieve these rates. Due to the strong nonlinearity of the underlying equation, the standard perturbation argument for error analysis of finite element approximations of nonlinear problems does not work for the problem. To overcome the difficulty, we employ a fixed point technique which strongly relies on the stability of the linearized problem and its mixed finite element approximations.	algebraic riccati equation;approximation algorithm;error analysis (mathematics);finite element method;fixed point (mathematics);nonlinear system;numerical analysis;vhdl-ams;viscosity solution	Xiaobing Feng;Michael Neilan	2009	SIAM J.

The nonhomegeneous boundary conditions are prescribed on the boundary of hold-all domain. The existence of the so-called weak normalized solutions for the model is established in [2]. In this talk we consider the associated shape optimization problems for the model. In the stationary case the drag of an obstacle is minimized. In the non stationary case the work for a fight scenario of an obstacle is minimized. It means that the boundary of an obstacle flying in a gas is optimized in such a way that for the given trajectory the energy required to attain a given point in the domain is minimized with respect to the shape of the obstacle. The family of admissible obstacles is sufficiently general and includes the standard shapes of an airfoil. We present the new results on the shape sensitivity analysis of the work functional for non stationary compressible Navier-Stokes equations [1]. In particular, the shape gradient is determined for the shape functional. The obtained results can be justified from mathematical point of view for the local solutions, or the global classical solutions of the model.	gradient;mathematical optimization;navier–stokes equations;point of view (computer hardware company);shape optimization;stationary process	Pavel I.

The determination of the strength of a heat source is achieved by using the boundary condition, initial condition and a known value of temperature in chosen points placed inside the domain. For the solution of the inverse problem of identification of the heat source the θ -method with the method of fundamental solution and radial basis functions is proposed. Due to ill conditioning of the inverse transient heat conduction problem the Tikhonov regularization method based on SVD decomposition was used. In order to determine the optimum value of the regularization parameter the L-curve criterion was used. For testing purposes of the proposed algorithm the 2-D inverse boundary-initial-value problems in square region Ω with the known analytical solutions are considered. The numerical results show that the proposed method is easy to implement and pretty accurate. Moreover the accuracy of the results does not depend on the value of the θ parameter and is greater in the case of the identification of the temperature field than in the case of the identification of the heat sources function.

The method is a modification of the so-calle d general Lagrange multipliers [2]. The method is based on the idea of constr ucting a correction functional that uses a Lagrange multiplier. In this study, we analyse some basic properties of the Lagrange multiplier; an d using these, we propose a new algorithm for solving initial and boundary v alue problems. In [1], a new approach that uses the matrix valued Lagrange mu ltiplier has been proposed. Further it is proven that there exists a close relation be ween the Lagrange multiplier and fundamental matrices of the homogeneous systems. This relation leads us to prove that whenever the initial approximation satisfies the initial conditions, the solution of initial value problem can be obtained with a single iteration. Moreover, it is also shown that when initial approximation satis fies the boundary conditions of the linear boundary value problem, the solution o f the system can be obtained with a single iteration, too. Main advantage of such a result is that the modified algorithm can be extended to nonlinear boundary v alue problems, and further, an approximate solution of such problems can be ob tained without using the theory of Green’s functions.	approximation algorithm;fundamental matrix (computer vision);initial condition;iteration;iterative method;lagrange multiplier;nonlinear system;the matrix;variational principle	D.

Results about convergence and convergence rates for exact data are derived based upon well-known convergence results about least-squares collocation.

In this paper we are concerned with accurate data assimilation of a sparsely observed passive tracer advected in turbulent flows using a reduced-order forecast model. The turbulent flows which contain anisotropic and inhomogeneous structures such as jets are typical in geophysical turbulent flows in atmosphere and ocean science and passive tracers with a mean gradient can exhibit anisotropic transport with intermittent extreme events as shown below. Stochastic superparameterization, which is a seamless multiscale method developed for large-scale models of atmosphere and ocean models without scale-gap between the resolved and unresolved scales, generates large-scale turbulent velocity fields using a significantly smaller degree of freedom compared to a direct fine resolution numerical simulation. In a large-scale model of the tracer transport, the tracer is advected by the large-scale velocity field generated by superparameterization with a parameterization of eddies, an additional eddy diffusion given by an anisotropic biharmonic diffusion. The turbulent tracer is sparsely observed in space in only the upper surface layer. These observations naturally mix the resolved and unresolved scales so we develop an ensemble multiscale data assimilation algorithm which provides estimates of the resolved scales using the mixed observations. The reduced-order model is 200 times cheaper than the fine resolution solution and thus enables us to increase the number of ensemble for accurate predictions of state distributions. Numerical experiments show positive results in the estimation of the resolved scales of the tracer as well as in capturing anisotropic intermittent extreme events for the unresolved portions of the tracer field.	algorithm;anisotropic diffusion;autocorrelation;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;data assimilation;ensemble kalman filter;ensemble forecasting;estimation theory;experiment;fits;filter (signal processing);gradient;information theory;noise (electronics);numerical analysis;numerical method;rare events;seamless3d;stationary process;stochastic process;super-resolution imaging;turbulence;velocity (software development)	Yoonsang Lee;Andrew J.

37371f1670497e1e96cd5504d689e8ac6489873a	on the efficient implementation of social abstract argumentation		In this paper we present a novel iterative algorithm – the Iterative Successive Substitution (ISS) – to efficiently approximate the models of debates structured according to Social Abstract Argumentation [10]. Classical iterative algorithms such as the Iterative Newton-Raphson (INR) and the Iterative Fixed-point (IFP) don’t always converge and, when they do, usually take too long to be effective. We analytically prove convergence of ISS, and empirically show that, even when INR and IFP converge, ISS always outperforms them, often by several orders of magnitude. The ISS is able to approximate the models of complex debates with thousands of arguments in well under a second, often in under one tenth of a second, making it comfortably suitable for its purpose. Additionally, we present a small modification to ISS that, with a negligible overhead, takes advantage of the topological structure of certain debates to significantly increase convergence times.	approximation algorithm;converge;debategraph;experiment;international symposium on fundamentals of computation theory;iteration;iterative method;natural language;newton's method;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;overhead (computing)	Marco Correia;Jorge Cruz;João Leite	2014		10.3233/978-1-61499-419-0-225	computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;algorithm	AI	85.91346825552486	24.656532505783563	54614

The analysis presented in this paper is used to determine an efficient strategy for the parameter step size and number of iterations at each parameter value to achieve a solution to a required tolerance. We present computational results for the deformation of a Lennard-Jones chain under tension to demonstrate the necessity of carefully applying continuation to ensure that the computed solution remains in the domain of convergence of the iterative method as the parameter is increased.

Using the first integral of the angular momentum, we reduce the dimension of the phase space of the problem by two units. Since periodic orbits of the reduced isosceles problem generate invariant two-dimensional tori of the nonreduced problem, the analytic continuation of periodic orbits of the (reduced) circular Sitnikov problem at this level becomes the continuation of invariant two-dimensional tori from the circular Sitnikov problem to the nonreduced isosceles problem, each one filled with periodic or quasi-periodic orbits. These tori are not KAM tori but just isotropic, since we are dealing with a three-degrees-of-freedom system. The continuation of periodic orbits is done in two different ways, the first going directly from the reduced circular Sitnikov problem to the reduced isosceles problem, and the second one using two steps: first we continue the periodic orbits from the reduced circular Sitnikov problem to the reduced elliptic Sitnikov problem, and then we continue those periodic orbits of the reduced elliptic Sitnikov problem to the reduced isosceles problem. The continuation in one or two steps produces different results. This work is merely analytic and uses the variational equations in order to apply Poincaré’s continuation method.	angularjs;command & conquer:yuri's revenge;distance (graph theory);emoticon;nl (complexity);numerical aperture;numerical continuation;operational amplifier;optic axis of a crystal;quasiperiodicity;variational principle	Montserrat Corbera;Jaume Llibre	2004	SIAM J.

c2ef125cbd309df12a58242325ef64512fc3100b	multigrid optimization for dns-based optimal control in turbulent channel flows		Abstract The use of PDE-constrained optimization techniques in combination with transient three-dimensional turbulent flow simulations such as Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) or Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) involves large computational cost and memory resources. To date, the minimization of a DNS-based cost functional is typically achieved by applying classical single-grid gradient-based iterative methods of quasi-Newton or non-linear conjugate gradient type. In the current study, a multigrid optimization (MG/OPT) strategy is investigated in order to speed up gradient-based algorithms designed for large scale optimization problems. The method employs a hierarchy of optimization problems defined on different representation levels. It aims to reduce the computational resources associated with the cost functional improvement on the finest level. We apply the MG/OPT method in the context of direct numerical simulations of a fully developed channel flow problem. The performance of the multigrid optimization technique is compared against the single-grid optimization method in terms of equivalent function and gradient evaluations. Also the influence of the optimization problem properties and algorithmic parameters are investigated. It is found that, in some cases, the MG/OPT method accelerates the single-grid damped L-BFGS method by a factor of four.	mathematical optimization;multigrid method;optimal control;turbulence	C.

The theoretical background to finite element methods is used to understand the basis of present-day geometrical mesh quality indicators. A survey of more recent research in the development of finite element methods describes work on anisotropic meshing algorithms, and on providing good error estimates that reveal the relationship between the error and both the mesh and the solution gradients. The reality of solving complex three-dimensional problems is that such indicators are presently not available for many problems of interest. A simple tetrahedral mesh quality measure using both geometrical and solution information is described. Some of the issues in mesh quality for unstructured tetrahedral meshes are illustrated by means of two simple examples.	algorithm;anisotropic diffusion;computational fluid dynamics;finite element method;gradient;mesh generation;polygon mesh;turbulence	Martin Berzins	1998	Engineering with Computers	10.1007/s003660050019	three-dimensional space;mesh generation;mathematical optimization;computer science;volume mesh;finite element method;mathematics;geometry;laplacian smoothing;engineering drawing;t-vertices	Visualization	93.95642008559491	11.492617671504059	55289

The paper first introduces a new second-order PR-ADI like scheme. For an efficient simulation, the scheme is also extended to a highorder compact PRADI likemethod. Both of them have the advantages of unconditional stability, less impact of the perturbing terms on the accuracy, and being convenient to compute the boundary values of the intermediates. Besides this, the compact scheme has high-order accuracy and costs less in computational time. Numerical results are presented to show the accuracy and efficiency of the new algorithms.

The bounds have two contributions. First, the influence of boundary conditions is taken into account through a discrete maximum principle. Second, the contribution of the source field is evaluated in a fashion similar to that used in the treatment of the continuous a priori operators. Closed form expressions are, in particular, obtained for the case of a conservative, second-order finite difference approximation of the diffusion equation with variable scalar diffusivity. The bounds are then incorporated into a resilient domain decomposition framework, in order to verify the admissibility of local PDE solutions. The computations demonstrate that the bounds are able to detect most system faults, and thus considerably enhance the resilience and the overall performance of the solver.	approximation;computation;domain decomposition methods;finite difference;numerical partial differential equations;solver	Paul Mycek;Francesco Rizzi;Olivier P.

The Poisson problem discretization is based on a second-order finite-volume technique on prisms elements, consisting of triangular grids in the horizontal direction and bounded by an irregular free surface and bottom in the vertical direction. The resulting linear system is solved using the Jacobi method, and the parallelization is designed by using different GPU memory management as shared, texture and managed memory. Numerical experiments are conducted to test and compare the performance of the proposed parallel technique.		Miguel Uh Zapata;Francisco J.

We prove that the conductivity outside the inclusions, and the shape and position of the perfectly conducting and insulating inclusions are uniquely determined (except in an exceptional case) by the magnitude of the current generated by imposing a given boundary voltage. We have found an extension of the notion of admissibility to the case of possible presence of perfectly conducting and insulating inclusions. This also makes it possible to extend the results on uniqueness of the minimizers of the least gradient problem F (u) = ∫ Ω a|∇u| with u|∂Ω = f to cases where u has flat regions (is constant on open sets).	admissible heuristic;gradient	Amir Moradifam;Adrian Nachman;Alexandru Tamasan	2012	SIAM J.

Here, the focus is put on numerical methods: a monotone finite difference scheme is proposed and shown to have a variational interpretation. Then an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers for solving the variational problem is addressed. It is based on an augmented Lagrangian. Two kinds of boundary conditions are considered: periodic conditions and more realistic boundary conditions associated to state constrained problems.

97937c461b89c97f922206ece5b8c29666899928	schur complement preconditioners for surface integral-equation formulations of dielectric problems solved with the multilevel fast multipole algorithm	78a55;65b99;65r20;78a45;preconditioning;sparse approximate inverse preconditioners;78m05;31a10;dielectric problems;computational electromagnetics;65y20;partitioned matrices;65f10;schur complement reduction method;integral equation methods	Surface integral-equation methods accelerated with the multilevel fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA) provide a suitable mechanism for electromagnetic analysis of real-life dielectric problems. Unlike the perfect-electric-conductor case, discretizations of surface formulations of dielectric problems yield 2 × 2 partitioned linear systems. Among various surface formulations, the combined tangential formulation (CTF) is the closest to the category of first-kind integral equations, and hence it yields the most accurate results, particularly when the dielectric constant is high and/or the dielectric problem involves sharp edges and corners. However, matrix equations of CTF are highly ill-conditioned, and their iterative solutions require powerful preconditioners for convergence. Second-kind surface integral-equation formulations yield better conditioned systems, but their conditionings significantly degrade when real-life problems include high dielectric constants. In this paper, for the first time in the context of surface integral-equation methods of dielectric objects, we propose Schur complement preconditioners to increase their robustness and efficiency. First, we approximate the dense system matrix by a sparse near-field matrix, which is formed naturally by MLFMA. The Schur complement preconditioning requires approximate solutions of systems involving the (1,1) partition and the Schur complement. We approximate the inverse of the (1,1) partition with a sparse approximate inverse (SAI) based on the Frobenius norm minimization. For the Schur complement, we first approximate it via incomplete sparse matrix-matrix multiplications, and then we generate its approximate inverse with the same SAI technique. Numerical experiments on sphere, lens, and photonic crystal problems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed preconditioners. In particular, the results for the photonic crystal problem, which has both surface singularity and a high dielectric constant, shows that accurate CTF solutions for such problems can be obtained even faster than with second-kind integral equation formulations, with the acceleration provided by the proposed Schur complement preconditioners.	approximation algorithm;authorization;charge trap flash;command & conquer:yuri's revenge;condition number;diagonally dominant matrix;discretization;dual ec drbg;experiment;fast fourier transform;fast multipole method;generalized minimal residual method;iteration;iterative method;linear algebra;linear system;matrix multiplication;numerical analysis;numerical aperture;numerical method;performance;preconditioner;real life;solver;sparse matrix;ut-vpn	Tahir Malas;Levent Gürel	2011	SIAM J.

Using the boundary element method (BEM) and Lagrangian crack-fronts, we produce highly detailed fracture surfaces. The computational cost of the BEM is alleviated by using a low-resolution mesh and interpolating the resulting stress intensity factors when propagating the high-resolution crack-front.  Our system produces physics-based fracture surfaces with high spatial and temporal resolution, taking spatial variation of material toughness and/or strength into account. It also allows for crack initiation to be handled separately from crack propagation, which is not only more reasonable from a physics perspective, but can also be used to control the simulation.  Separating the resolution of the crack-front from the resolution of the computational mesh increases the efficiency and therefore the amount of visual detail on the resulting fracture surfaces. The BEM also allows us to re-use previously computed blocks of the system matrix.	algorithmic efficiency;boundary element method;computation;graph toughness;image resolution;interpolation;propagation delay;simulation;software propagation	David Hahn;Christopher Wojtan	2015	ACM Trans.

A conventional supernode is stored as a dense submatrix. While this is suitable for sparse Cholesky factorization where the nonzero pattern of L does not change, it is not suitable for methods that modify a sparse Cholesky factorization after a low-rank change to A (an update/downdate, Ā = A ± WWT). Supernodes merge and split apart during an update/downdate. Dynamic supernodes are introduced which allow a sparse Cholesky update/downdate to obtain performance competitive with conventional supernodal methods. A dynamic supernodal solver is shown to exceed the performance of the conventional (BLAS-based) supernodal method for solving triangular systems. These methods are incorporated into CHOLMOD, a sparse Cholesky factorization and update/downdate package which forms the basis of x = A\b MATLAB when A is sparse and symmetric positive definite.	blas;cholesky decomposition;column (database);matlab;solver;sparse matrix;supernode (circuit)	Timothy A.

This paper introduces the application of that theory to numerical solutions of partial differential equations and its ramifications on the performance of high-order methods. Explicit application of boundary conditions (BCs) that are independent of the initial condition (IC) results in the compatibility conditions not being satisfied. Since this is the case in most science and engineering applications, it is shown that not only does the error in a spectral method, as measured in the maximum norm, converge algebraically, but the accuracy of finite differences is also reduced. For the heat equation with a parabolic IC and Dirichlet BCs, we prove that the Fourier method converges quadratically in the neighborhood of t = 0 and the boundaries and quartically for large t when the first-order compatibility conditions are violated. For the same problem, the Chebyshev method initially yields quartic convergence and exponential convergence for t > 0. In contrast, the wave equation subject to the same conditions results in inferior convergence rates with all spectral methods yielding quadratic convergence for all t. These results naturally direct attention to finite difference methods that are also algebraically convergent. In the case of the wave equation, we prove that a second-order finite difference method is reduced to 4/3-order convergence and numerically show that a fourth-order finite difference scheme is apparently reduced to 3/2-order. Finally, for the wave equation subject to general ICs and zero BCs, we give a conjecture on the error for a second-order finite difference scheme, showing that an O(N−2 logN) convergence is possible.	boundary case;converge;finite difference method;first-order predicate;initial condition;numerical analysis;parabolic antenna;rate of convergence;spectral method;time complexity	Natasha Flyer;Paul N.

Specifically, we consider systems, written as usual in block form, where the upper left block is an invertible linear operator with positive definite symmetric part. Such saddle point problems arise, for example, in certain finite element and finite difference discretizations of Navier–Stokes equations, Oseen equations, and mixed finite element discretization of second order convection-diffusion problems. We consider two algorithms, each of which utilizes a preconditioner for the operator in the upper left block. Convergence results for the algorithms are established in appropriate norms. The convergence of one of the algorithms is shown assuming only that the preconditioner is spectrally equivalent to the inverse of the symmetric part of the operator. The other algorithm is shown to converge provided that the preconditioner is a sufficiently accurate approximation of the inverse of the upper left block. Applications to the solution of steady-state Navier–Stokes equations are discussed, and, finally, the results of numerical experiments involving the algorithms are presented.	algorithm;approximation;converge;discretization;experiment;finite difference;finite element method;iterative method;navier–stokes equations;numerical analysis;preconditioner;steady state	James H.

The aim of this paper is to study a topological derivative based anomaly detection algorithm. We compare its performance with other imaging approaches such as MUltiple Signal Classification algorithm (MUSIC), backpropagation, and Kirchhoff migration. We also investigate its stability with respect to medium and measurement noises as well as its resolution. A simple postprocessing of the data set is introduced and shown to be essential in order to obtain an efficient topological based imaging functional, both in terms of resolution and stability.	algorithm;anomaly detection;backpropagation;image resolution;kirchhoff's theorem;music (algorithm);resolution (logic);topological derivative	Habib Ammari;Josselin Garnier;Vincent Jugnon;Hyeonbae Kang	2012	SIAM J.

We propose a novel integral equation formulation for the direct scattering problem which is defined on a bounded curve (consisting of a bounded part of the infinite plane containing the local perturbation and the lower part of a circle) with two corners. This novel integral equation can be solved efficiently by using the Nyström method with a graded mesh introduced previously by Kress and is capable of dealing with large wave number cases. For the inverse problem, we propose a Newton iteration method to reconstruct the local perturbation of the plane from multiple-frequency far-field data, based on the novel integral equation formulation. Numerical examples are carried out to demonstrate that our reconstruction method is stable and accurate even for the case of multiple-scale profiles.	acoustic cryptanalysis;iteration;newton's method;numerical method;nyström method;scattering theory	Haiwen Zhang;Bo Zhang	2013	SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics	10.1137/130908324	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;inverse scattering problem;calculus;mathematics;newton's method;inverse scattering transform;integral equation	Vision	90.23231773568304	8.017533170271225	56188

The DDA has been used, for example, in calculations of optical properties of cosmic dust. In this method the particle is approximated by interacting electromagnetic dipoles. Computationally the DDA method includes the solution of large dense systems of linear equations where the coefficient matrix is complex symmetric. In this work, the linear systems of equations are solved by various iterative methods. QMR was found to be the best iterative method in this application. It converged in only a few more iterations than the full generalized minimal residual (GMRES) method. When the discretization of the particle was refined, the number of iterations remained constant even without preconditioning. The matrix–vector product in the iterative methods can be computed with the fast Fourier transform or the fast multipole algorithm.

Inductance extraction is a critical component of the parasitic extraction process that involves estimation of on-chip inductive effects with high accuracy. The problem requires the solution of a large, dense, complex linear system of equations, where the unknown current must satisfy the constraint imposed by Kirchoff’s current law. In this paper, we describe a solenoidal basis method to transform the constrained linear system into an unconstrained one. The method uses discrete local solenoidal flows to represent the unknown current, and to obtain a reduced linear system. The paper proposes preconditioning techniques that do not require explicit construction of the reduced system. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the preconditioning approach. Comparisons with a well-known inductance extraction package are provided to highlight the advantages of the proposed scheme.	benchmark (computing);coefficient;experiment;generalized minimal residual method;inductive coupling;iteration;iterative method;linear system;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;preconditioner;simulation;sparse matrix;system of linear equations;very-large-scale integration	Hemant Mahawar;Vivek Sarin	2007	SIAM J.

Homogeneous random fields are used to model this kind of uncertainty. The first step of the investigation is the random field discretization, which transforms a random field into a finite set of random variables. The second step is the reliability analysis, which is performed using the FORM in this paper. A parametric analysis of the reliability index is usually performed with respect to the random field discretization accuracy. This approach requires several independent reliability analyses. A new and efficient approach is proposed in this paper. The Karhunen–Loève series expansion is combined with the FEM for the discretization of the random fields. An efficient solution of the reliability problem is proposed to predict the reliability index as the discretization accuracy increases.	computation;discretization;form;finite element method;gradient;numerical analysis;reliability engineering;series expansion;truncation	Diego Lorenzo Allaix;Vincenzo Ilario Carbone	2015	Engineering with Computers	10.1007/s00366-015-0394-1	random variate;discretization error;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;random field;random element;morphometrics;random function;mathematics;statistics	HPC	96.045257934518	8.68029495169741	56693

Approximation values at desired points in the domain can be computed through the process of conformal transplantation.

A numerical method is suggested in this paper to solve such problems. In this method, the given BVP is transformed into a system of two ODEs subject to suitable initial and boundary conditions. Then the domain of definition of the differential equation (a closed interval) is divided into two sub-intervals, which we call the inner region (boundary layer) and the outer region. Then the DE is solved in these intervals separately. The solutions obtained in these intervals are combined to give the solution in the whole interval. To obtain boundary conditions at the transition points (boundary values inside this interval) we use mostly the zeroth-order asymptotic expansion of the solution of the BVP or a suitable asymptotic expansion solution. First, the linear equations are considered and then the semi-linear equations. To solve semi-linear equations Newton's method of quasi-linearisation is applied. Examples are provided to illustrate the method. The method is easy to implement and suitable for parallel computing.		S. Valarmathi;N.

Many scientists have struggled to represent bubble behavior. [Hong et al. 2008] proposed a hybrid method of Eulerian grids and Lagrangian particles in order to visualize small-scale bubbles in large-scale water body. Bubble particles are seeded randomly at the bottom and disappear when they reach the surface. In addition, [Ihmsen et al. 2011] proposed another two-way coupling method for water and air because of the large density ratio of water to air. Each phase is treated separately and combined together. Bubbles are seeded on the fly, treated as foam on the surface and deleted after a user defined time. Both researches use SPH (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics) as the particle method and succeeded to visualize the bubble behavior; however, bubbles are generated in calm water and the water is incompressible. They also did not treat the behavior of bubble rupture. On the other hand, [Bird et al. 2010] revealed that numerous small bubbles (daughter bubbles) are generated when a bubble ruptures, and the small bubbles create a ring. Therefore, we propose a method to simulate the rupturing behavior of a bubble with MPS (Moving Particle Semi-implicit), which is another particle method that can treat incompressible fluid.	augmented lagrangian method;computer graphics;dot-com bubble;on the fly;randomness;simulation;smoothed-particle hydrodynamics;smoothing;steam rupture	Nobuhiko Mukai;Noburo Kagatsume;Masashi Nakagawa	2012		10.1145/2342896.2343042	smoothed-particle hydrodynamics;simulation;computer science;compressibility;volume rendering;computer graphics (images)	Graphics	94.47942951703732	5.844873599380832	58093

In this scenario, determination of the obvious entropy/disorder arising during the implementation has not been taken care of yet. Therefore, this paper gives the basis for applying query and visual perception of GMP system driven visualization approach, particularly the Laplace equation, to the determination of disorder and deviation pattern inside the GMP system applied in the organization. In this study, a three-dimensional mesh approached with raw and intermediate input handled under GMP parameter is considered to produce high quality products with minimum entropy (variation distribution) by adding the analogy wise different GMP parameters and process variables with Gauss Seidel iteration and thus producing visual picture of the entire system. The approximation involved in applying the equations to the GMP compliant aseptic region was analyzed. Using numerical technique and computer program, the Gauss Seidel iteration equations have been solved with appropriate GMP parameter and process variable. The result indicates that deviations vary over the GMP compliant system and that the process entropy affects the totality of disorderness. Experiments with model of GMP compliant reproductive medicine laboratory confirm that the new method provides optimal manufacturing maintaining GMP and high product quality through the visual representation of the entire system and activity to bring into notice the deviations.

The material is fed with sinusoidal alternating magnetic field. For the numerical solution of the resulting second order nonlinear partial differential equation, a Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method (the Yee-algorithm) combined with the material Limiting Loop Proximity Hysteresis (LLPH) characteristic is introduced. Stability problems of the numerical method is examined on the basis of the resulted attractor of the iterative map, which exhibits period-doubling bifurcations and chaotic behavior under certain parameter values. The stability analysis based on this attractor is focusing on the reasons behind the instability of the implicit inner iteration. 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

4341c003a14ba4e7a5609a145bda977f36ca58bb	numerical method for the time optimal control problem governed by the benjamin-bona-mahony equation		This paper deals with the numerical approximation for the time optimal control problem governed by the Benjamin-Bona-Mahony BBM equation, which is an unspecified terminal time problem. Firstly, by projecting the original problem with the finite element method FEM, another approximate problem governed by a system of ordinary differential equations will be obtained. Then, the parameterisation method for the optimal time and the control function will be carried out and the unspecified terminal time problem can be reduced to an optimal parameter selection problem with a fixed time horizon [0, 1]. This optimal parameter selection problem is a standard nonlinear mathematical programming problem and can be solved by sequential quadratic programming SQP algorithm. Finally, some numerical simulation studies will be given to illustrate the effectiveness of our numerical approximation method for the time optimal control problem governed by the BBM equation.	numerical method;optimal control	Xin Yu;Qian Zhang;Haolan Zhang;Chao Xu	2016	IJCSE	10.1504/IJCSE.2016.10000236	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;finite element method;calculus;mathematics;sequential quadratic programming	Robotics	86.5367073275094	15.393705102445516	58188

These equations can be obtained from the standard advection diffusion equations by replacing the second order spatial derivative by a fractional operator of order α with 1 < α ≤ 2. This operator is defined by a combination of the left and right Riemann–Liouville fractional derivatives. We study the convergence of the numerical method through consistency and stability. The order of convergence varies between two and three and for advection dominated flows is close to three. Although the method is conditionally stable, the restrictions allow wide stability regions. The analysis is confirmed by numerical examples.	finite difference method;numerical method;numerical stability;rate of convergence	Ercília Sousa	2014	J. Comput.

43c0a0c6f0517edd93dd18b171e881559acdc6bf	numerical simulation of elastic-plastic solid mechanics using an eulerian stretch tensor approach and hlld riemann solver	stretch tensor;richtmyer meshkov instability;approximate multi material riemann solver;eulerian solid mechanics	An Eulerian, multi-material numerical method is described for computing dynamic problems involving large deformations in elastic-plastic solids. This approach addresses algorithm failures associated with reconnection and change in topology observed in previously proposed formulations. Among the information contained in the deformation gradients commonly employed for defining constitutive laws suitable for solids, only the symmetric matrix tensor obtained from a polar decomposition of the elastic component of the deformation is required to determine the stress state. The numerical utilization of this symmetric tensor, associated with material stretch, eliminates undesirable, discontinuous deformation states produced by local rigid-body rotations at same-material reconnecting interfaces. Such states appear even where stress states in impacting regions are similar. The temporal evolution of the stretches neither modifies the eigenstructure of the system of equations nor changes its size. We also present a new multi-material approximate Riemann solver based on the HLLD approach, previously applied to other hyperbolic systems, in which waves of distinct velocity exist, for example, as in magnetohydrodynamics. This solver is employed in combination with the modified ghost fluid method (M-GFM) in the description of multi-material interfaces. These composite algorithms enable numerical simulations of the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (i.e., the instability produced by the interaction of an interface separating materials of different density with a shock wave at an angle) in converging geometries for solid materials that would have previously led to the failure of the method.	computer simulation;riemann solver	A.

The underlying discretization method is implicit Euler in time and mixed finite elements or cell-centred finite differences in space. IPARS permits rigorous, physically representative coupling of different physical and numerical flow models in different parts of the domain and accounts for structural discontinuities; the framework currently includes eight physical models. For simplicity of exposition, we have restricted our discussion to a two-phase oil–water model and a three-phase black oil model. Our decoupling approach involves extracting a pressure equation from the fully coupled linearized system thus allowing for a more accurate preconditioning of a discrete elliptic problem of lower dimension.

We build a time-reversible, fully explicit time-stepping algorithm to approximate the solution of the Hagedorn wavepacket dynamics. The algorithm is based on a splitting between the kinetic and potential part of the Hamiltonian operator, as well as on a splitting of the potential into its local quadratic approximation and the remainder. The algorithm is robust in the semi-classical limit. It reduces to the Strang splitting of the Schrödinger equation in the limit of the full basis set, and it advances positions and momenta by the Störmer–Verlet method for the classical equations of motion. The algorithm allows for the treatment of multi-particle problems by thinning out the basis according to a hyperbolic cross approximation, and of high-dimensional problems by Hartree-type approximations in a moving coordinate frame.	approximation algorithm;basis set (chemistry);classical limit;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);polynomial;quantum dynamics;schrödinger;semiclassical physics;semiconductor industry;software propagation;stepping level;strang splitting;thinning;verlet integration;wave packet	Erwan Faou;Vasile Gradinaru;Christian Lubich	2009	SIAM J.

60704b8d49250447d2962f84f22211a982df6b18	isogeometric boundary element method for calculating effective property of steady state thermal conduction in 2d heterogeneities with a homogeneous interphase		Abstract Based on the generalized self-consistent scheme (GSCS), the isogeometric boundary element method (IGABEM) is used to calculate the effective thermal conductivity of two dimensional (2D) steady state heat conduction heterogeneities with a homogeneous interphase. The heat energy formulation and the boundary integral equations adopted in this paper only contain the temperatures from the inclusion–interphase and interphase–matrix interfaces, respectively, so that the effective thermal conductivity from the generalized self-consistent model with a homogeneous interphase can be conveniently calculated. In numerical implementation, the Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) are employed not only to construct the exact interface shapes but also to approximate the interface temperatures. The results show that the conductivity and the thickness of the homogeneous interphase have great influence on the effective thermal conductivity. Higher interphase thermal conductivity enhances the effective thermal conductivity, whereas thinner thickness of the interphase results in the reduction of the effective thermal conductivity. Numerical examples show that the proposed method works well compared with the conventional quadratic isoparametric boundary element method.	boundary element method;interphase;isogeometric analysis;steady state	X.

This paper remedies this by a central difference schemes in time which itself has a regularizing effect for a non-standard IHCP which appears in some applied subjects. An error estimate is obtained and the error estimate also gives information about how to choose the step length in the time discretization.

The algo rithm reduces the partial differential equation to a linear system. Problems requiring enormous resources with a finite element or finite difference method are tractable with the Galerkin approach. However, the construction of Galerkin equations often is more costly than their so lution. The straightforward construction has inner loop lengths on the order of the approximation k, which is typically 4. We rearrange the construction so that the inner loops are over the number of mesh points n on a side. On vector machines this produces a speedup of nearly nlk for constructing the matrix equations for the interior points of the domain. We also discuss the per formance of the linear system solvers in TTGR on vector and scalar machines on problems with different orders of B-spline approximations.	scalar processor	Linda Kaufman;Norman L.

The discrete Lagrange multiplier, an approximation of the surface traction on the contact boundary part, is a linear combination of biorthogonal basis functions. In case of curved elements, these are the solutions of local problems . In particular, the biorthogonality allows to rewrite the variational inequality constraints as a simple set of complementarity problems. Thus, enabling an efficient application of a semi-smooth Newton solver for the discrete mixed problem, converging locally super-linearly in the frictional case and quadratically in the frictionless case. Typically, the solution of frictional contact problems is of reduced regularity at the interface between contact to non-contact and from stick to slip. To identify the a priori unknown locations of these interfaces two a posteriori error estimations are introduced. In a first step the error is split into specific error contributions resulting from the contact and friction conditions and from the discretization error of a variational equation. For the latter a residual and a bubble error estimation are considered explicitly. The numerical experiments show the applicability of the derived error estimations, in particular in the Coulomb friction case, and the superiority of hp-adaptivity compared to low order uniform and adaptive approaches. ∗Institute of Applied Mathematics, Leibniz University Hannover, Welfengarten 1, 30167 Hannover, Germany, E-Mail: {stephan}@ifam.uni-hannover.de	approximation;basis function;boundary element method;calculus of variations;complementarity theory;discretization error;elasticity (data store);experiment;lagrange multiplier;newton;numerical analysis;rewrite (programming);semiconductor industry;simple set;social inequality;solver;traction teampage;variational inequality	Lothar Banz;Ernst P.

Both the hybrid smoother proposed by Hiptmair and the overlapping block smoother proposed by Arnold, Falk and Winther are considered. The key to our approach is the identification of two-dimensional eigenspaces of the discrete curl-curl problem by decou-pling the Fourier modes for edges with different orientations. Our analysis allows to quantify the smoothing properties of the considered smoothers and the convergence behavior of the considered multigrid methods. Additionally, we identify the Helmholtz splitting in Fourier space. This allows to recover several well known properties in Fourier space, such as the commutation properties of the classical Nédélec prolongator and the equivalence of the curl-curl operator and the vector Laplacian for divergence-free vectors. We show how the approach used in this paper can be generalized to two-and three-dimensional problems in H(curl) and H(div) and to other types of regular meshes. 1. Introduction. The convergence of iterative methods for linear systems that arise from the discretization of a partial differential equation (PDE) can often be studied in a model problem setting by means of Fourier modes. In a local Fourier analysis (LFA) or local mode analysis, an infinite, regular grid is considered and boundary conditions are not taken into account. This type of analysis was introduced in [5]. It has been applied successfully to iterative solvers for several types of PDEs, such as the diffusion equation, the convection-diffusion equation, the Helmholtz equation, the biharmonic equation, the Stokes equations, the Oseen equations and elasticity. For comprehensive surveys, we refer the reader to [13, 15, 14].

Natural convection in porous media is an important subject with applications in many geophysical and engineering fields, such as CO2 sequestration in brine aquifers. Numerical modelling plays an important role in understanding the dynamics of these flows and making suitable decisions. However, the traditional process of developing numerical solvers is time-consuming and error-prone. Objectives. This paper aims to present the design, implementation and verification of a fully coupled finite element solver for the simulation of natural convection in porous media, by making use of automated solution techniques. Methods. The mathematical model is composed of the mass conservation equation for fluid flow, Darcy’s law to relate pressure and velocity, and the advection-diffusion equation for the temperature/concentration field. In order to discretize the system of equations, a mixed finite element pair, namely a Brezzi-Douglas-Marini element and a discontinuous Galerkin element, is ∗Corresponding author Email address: chao.zhang@auckland.ac.nz (Chao Zhang) Preprint submitted to Computers & Geosciences August 20, 2016 used to interpolate the velocity and the pressure field, respectively, while a discontinuous Galerkin element is chosen for the temperature/concentration. With the help of automated solution techniques, a readable and extensible code is developed for this class of multiphysics problems. The code is developed with FEniCS, an open-source framework for the automated solution of partial differential equations through the finite element method. Results. After a convergence test using the method of manufactured solutions, the developed solver is validated by comparing the numerical results against commonly cited benchmarks. In all cases, results in this work are in good agreement with the benchmarks. Conclusion. The test results demonstrate the correctness of the implementation and the effectiveness of automated solution techniques for model development.	benchmark (computing);chao (sonic);cognitive dimensions of notations;correctness (computer science);discretization;email;finite element method;galerkin method;interpolation;mathematical model;multiphysics;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;open-source software;simulation;solver;velocity (software development)	Chao Zhang;Sadiq J.

The algorithm is based on the Discontinuous Galerkin Method and Minimax Estimation, and is applied to a macroscopic model based on a scalar conservation law. We present numerical results which demonstrate the shock-capturing capability of the algorithm under high uncertainty in the initial traffic condition, using only sparse measurements, and under time-dependent boundary conditions. The latter makes it possible for estimation to be performed on merge/diverge sections, allowing the possibility of the deployment of the algorithm to road networks.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;boundary case;computation;data assimilation;discontinuous galerkin method;elemental;minimax;numerical analysis;sensor;shock capturing method;software deployment;sparse matrix;spectral method	Tigran T.

To capture this balance and near-equilibrium solutions, well-balanced methods have been introduced and performed well in many numerical tests. Shallow water equations have been extensively investigated as a prototype example. In this paper, we develop well-balanced discontinuous Galerkin methods for the shallow water system, which preserve not only the still water at rest steady state, but also the more general moving water equilibrium. The key idea is the recovery of well-balanced states, a special source term approximation, and the approximation of the numerical fluxes based on a generalized hydrostatic reconstruction. We also study the extension of the positivity-preserving limiter presented in [40] in this framework. Numerical examples are provided at the end to verify the well-balanced property and good resolution for smooth and discontinuous solutions.	galerkin method	Yulong Xing	2014	J. Comput.

In particular, we formulate a compatibility condition relative to the preservation of genuinely oscillating modes that takes the form of a generalized commuting diagram, and we show that compatible schemes satisfy convergence estimates leading to longtime stability near stationary solutions. We next apply these findings by specifying compatible formulations for several classes of Galerkin methods, such as the usual curl-conforming finite elements and the centered discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme. We also propose a new conforming/non-conforming Galerkin (Conga) method where fully discontinuous solutions are computed by embedding the general structure of curl-conforming finite elements into larger DG spaces. In addition to naturally preserving one of the Gauss laws in a strong sense, the Conga method is both spectrally correct and energy conserving, unlike existing DG discretizations where the introduction of a dissipative penalty term is necessary to avoid the presence of spurious modes.	approximation;correctness (computer science);diagram;discontinuous galerkin method;finite element method;linear programming relaxation;maxwell (microarchitecture);numerical analysis;semiconductor industry;simulation;stationary process;steady state;curl	Martin Campos Pinto;Eric Sonnendrücker	2016	Math.

In particular we investigate the numerical results from three alternative network models, all three based on the isothermal Euler equations. Using two different test cases, we focus on the physical validity of simulation results from each of the models. Unphysical solutions are characterised by the presence of energy production in junctions. Our results are in accordance with previous conclusions; that only one of the the network models yields physical solutions for all subsonic initial conditions. The last test case shows in addition how the three models may predict fundamentally different waves for a given set of initial data.	bernoulli polynomials;coupling constant;euler;evaluation function;geographic data files;initial condition;network model;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;simulation;subsonic;test case	Gunhild Allard Reigstad;Tore Flåtten	2013		10.1007/978-3-319-10705-9_66	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;calculus;mathematics	AI	92.01854373449747	5.304098632424872	59915

The aim of this research work is to solve these classes of equations using a high order compact finite difference scheme. We consider the following inverse problem for finding  u ( x ,  t ) and  p ( t ) governed by  u   t   =  u   xx   +  p ( t ) u  +  φ ( x ,  t ) with an over specified condition inside the domain.

The convergence orders for the approximation of both  u  and  p  are of  o ( k  3  +  h  2 ) which improves the results obtained in the literature. An exact test case is used to evaluate the validity of our numerical analysis.

In many applications, the solution of a linear ill-posed problem is known to be nonnegative. Standard Tikhonov regularization often provides an approximated solution with negative entries. We apply the activeset method to find a nonnegative approximate solution of the linear system starting from the Tikhonov regularized one. Our numerical experiments show that the activeset method is effective in reducing the oscillations in the Tikhonov regularized solution and in providing a nonnegative regularized solution of the original linear system. 2005 Elsevier Inc.

(Math. Comp. 78:1–24, 2009), superconvergent discontinuous Galerkin methods are identified for linear non-selfadjoint and indefinite elliptic problems. With the help of an auxiliary problem which is the discrete version of a linear non-selfadjoint elliptic problem in divergence form, optimal error estimates of order k + 1 in L2-norm for the potential and the flux are derived, when piecewise polynomials of degree k ≥ 1 are used to approximate both potential and flux variables. Using a suitable post-processing of the discrete potential, it is then shown that the resulting post-processed potential converges with order k + 2 in L2-norm. The article is concluded with a numerical experiment which confirms the theoretical results.	approximation algorithm;converge;discontinuous galerkin method;discrete sine transform;experiment;gradient;numerical analysis;polynomial;rate of convergence;superconvergence;surround sound;video post-processing	Sangita Yadav;Amiya Kumar Pani;Neela Nataraj	2013	J.

The basic idea is to discretize the streaming step of the lattice Boltzmann equation by using SEDG method to get a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) whose exact solutions are expressed by using a large matrix exponential. The approximate solution of the resulting ODEs are obtained from a projection method based on a Krylov subspace approximation. This approach allows us to approximate the matrix exponential of a very large and sparse matrix by using a matrix of much smaller dimension. The exponential time integration scheme is useful especially when computations are carried out at high Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) numbers, where most explicit time-marching schemes are inaccurate. Simulations of flow were carried out for a circular cylinder at Re=20 and for two circular cylinders in tandem at Re=40 and a spacing of 2.5D, where D is the diameter of the cylinders. We compare our results with those from a fourth-order Runge-Kutta scheme that is restricted by the CFL number.

These methods are of particular interest in situations where the solution of the differential equation concentrates on a small part of the computational domain which may vary in time. For the space discretization, radial basis functions with compact support are suggested. The reasons for this choice are the stability and robustness of the resulting interpolation procedure. The time integration is performed with an exponential Rosenbrock method. The required matrix functions are computed by Newton interpolation based on Leja points. The proposed integrators are fully adaptive in space and time.

Numerical results demonstrate the order of time steps is $O(tau ^{2-alpha})$ and $O(tau^{3-alpha})$ when $0 lt alpha gt 1$ and $1 lt alpha gt 2$, respectively. Finally to overcome the nonlinear terms, predictor-corrector scheme is employed. The efficiency and usefulness of proposed method are demonstrated by some numerical examples.

7fb003a889bfe987b9bebda3afcabe8e66e66192	sparse systems solving on gpus with gmres	gmres;gpu;cuda;iterative methods	Scientific applications very often rely on solving one or more linear systems. When matrices are sparse, iterative methods are preferred to direct ones. Nevertheless, the value of nonzero elements and their distribution (i.e., the sketch of the matrix) greatly influence the efficiency of those methods (in terms of computation time, number of iterations, result precision) or simply prevent the convergence. Among iterative methods, GMRES (Saad, Iterative methods for sparse linear systems. PWS Publishing, New York, 1996) is often chosen when dealing with general nonsymmetric matrices. Indeed its convergence is very fast and more stable than the biconjugate gradient. Furthermore, it is mainly based on mathematical operations (matrix-vector and dot products, norms, etc.) that can be heavily parallelized and is thus a good candidate to implement a solver for sparse systems on Graphics Processing Units (GPU). This paper presents a GMRES method for such an architecture. It is based on the modified Gram–Schmidt approach and is very similar to that of Sparselib (Barrett et al., Templates for the solution of linear systems: building blocks for iterative methods, SIAM, Philadelphia, 1994). Our version uses restarting and a very basic preconditioning. For its implementation, we have based our code on CUBLAS (NVIDIA, http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/2_1/toolkit/docs/CUBLAS_Library_2.1.pdf , 2008) and SpMV (Bell and Garland, Efficient sparse matrix-vector multiplication on CUDA. NVIDIA technical report NVR-2008-004, 2008) libraries, in order to achieve a good performance whatever the matrix sizes and their sketch are. Our experiments exhibit encouraging results on the comparison between Central Processing Units (CPU) and GPU executions in double precision, obtaining a speedup ranging from 8 up to 23 for a large variety of problems.	algorithm;barrett reduction;cuda;central processing unit;computation;condition number;convex conjugate;dvd region code;double-precision floating-point format;experiment;generalized minimal residual method;gradient descent;graphics processing unit;high-level programming language;iteration;iterative method;library (computing);linear algebra;linear system;matrix multiplication;microsoft personal web server;parallel computing;preconditioner;schmidt decomposition;solver;sparse matrix;speedup;the matrix;time complexity;yousef saad	Raphaël Couturier;Stéphane Domas	2011	The Journal of Supercomputing	10.1007/s11227-011-0562-z	computational science;parallel computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;generalized minimal residual method;distributed computing;iterative method;matrix-free methods	HPC	84.56881939921854	23.58759091947086	60959

In certain cases the system develops a blow-up singularity in finite time. Fixed mesh methods are not well suited to approximate the problem near the singularity. As an alternative to reproduce the behaviour of the continuous solution, we present an adaptive in space procedure. The scheme recovers the conditions for blow-up and non-simultaneous blow-up. It also gives the correct non-simultaneous blow-up rate and set. Moreover, the numerical simultaneous blow-up rates coincide with the continuous ones in the cases when the latter are known. Finally, we present numerical experiments that illustrate the behaviour of the adaptive method.

The relaxation approximation transforms the nonlinear weakly hyperbolic equations to a semilinear strongly hyperbolic system with linear characteristic speeds and stiff source terms. The main ideas are to apply the weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) reconstruction for the spatial discretization and an implicit–explicit method for the temporal integration. To illustrate the performance of the method, numerical results are carried out on several test problems for the two-dimensional Hamilton–Jacobi equations with both convex and nonconvex Hamiltonians. 2006 Elsevier Inc.

51d2d69c53e1b1efe1703a22ff1f7dc03c312ef9	on the landau-de gennes elastic energy of constrained biaxial nematics	landau de gennes energy;76a15;82d30;49j40;bf q tensor theory;liquid crystals;constrained biaxial nematics	In the Landau-de Gennes theory, a nematic liquid crystal is described by a tensor order parameter, Q, which, at each point of the region Ω occupied by the system, is a symmetric, traceless 3× 3 matrix. The free-energy density ψ of nematic liquid crystals is expanded into powers of the components Qij of Q and Qij,k of its gradient ∇Q, and can be decomposed in the sum ψ = ψB +ψE of the bulk part ψB(Q) and the elastic part ψE(Q,∇Q). A most common expression for ψE is given by the four-constant approximation ψE(Q,∇Q) = L1Qij,jQik,k + L2Qik,jQij,k + L3Qij,kQij,k +L4QlkQij,lQij,k [1, 26, 27]. For general Q-tensors, it was shown that, if L4 6= 0, the corresponding free-energy functional is unbounded from below [1, 2]. On the other hand, if L4 = 0 and L1, L2, and L3 satisfy appropriate conditions, the elastic part of the energy functional is bounded and coercive [8, 21]. In the constrained theory in which Q has position independent eigenvalues, only the elastic energy has to be considered, since the bulk energy is constant. For constrained uniaxial systems, it is known that if L4 6= 0, the elastic density ψE reduces to the classical Oseen–Frank density and relations among L1, L2, L3, and L4 can be obtained so that the energy is coercive [3, 11, 21]. In this paper we address the question of coercivity for constrained biaxial systems. Conditions on L1, L2, L3, and L4 guaranteeing coercivity of the energy, and hence existence of minimizers, are established. In particular, we shall obtain the constrained biaxial counterpart of the classical Ericksen conditions for the constrained uniaxial case. For the proof, after deriving a Cartesian representation for ψE in terms of the three orthonormal eigenvector fields of Q, we use the identification of the order parameter space with the eightfold quotient of S3 ∼= Sp(1) by the quaternion group H and the description, in this model, of the condition for the frame indifference of Landau–de Gennes energy densities as given in [29].	approximation;cartesian closed category;gradient;position-independent code	Domenico Mucci;Lorenzo Nicolodi	2016	SIAM J.

It is shown that this solution is inapplicable because of the negative thickness of the boundary layer in the shaft neighborhood. Several new analytic solutions are obtained for the flow parameters inside the boundary layer of the casing motionless base. To reduce further the discrepancy between the analytic solution and the direct difference solution of three-dimensional Navier---Stokes equations it is proposed to account for the viscous friction force moment on the lateral casing wall. The consideration of this moment has improved considerably the accuracy of the approximate analytic solution.		Evgenii V.

c51f52e486af899d1fd4f582ae66ca4c67d88b15	tidal turbine array optimisation using the adjoint approach	tidal turbines;shallow water equations	Oceanic tides have the potential to yield a vast amount of renewable energy. Tidal stream generators are one of the key technologies for extracting and harnessing this potential. In order to extract an economically useful amount of power, hundreds of tidal turbines must typically be deployed in an array. This naturally leads to the question of how these turbines should be configured to extract the maximum possible power: the positioning and the individual tuning of the turbines could significantly influence the extracted power, and hence is of major economic interest. However, manual optimisation is difficult due to legal site constraints, nonlinear interactions of the turbine wakes, and the cubic dependence of the power on the flow speed. The novel contribution of this paper is the formulation of this problem as an optimisation problem constrained by a physical model, which is then solved using an efficient gradient-based optimisation algorithm. In each optimisation iteration, a two-dimensional finite element shallow water model predicts the flow and the performance of the current array configuration. The gradient of the power extracted with respect to the turbine positions and their tuning parameters is then computed in a fraction of the time taken for a flow solution by solving the associated adjoint equations. These equations propagate causality backwards through the computation, from the power extracted back to the turbine positions and the tuning parameters. This yields the gradient at a cost almost independent of the number of turbines, which is crucial for any practical application. The utility of the approach is demonstrated by optimising turbine arrays in four idealised scenarios and a more realistic case with up to 256 turbines in the Inner Sound of the Pentland Firth, Scotland.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;array data structure;bathymetry;causality;computation;cubic function;finite element method;gradient;interaction;iteration;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;open-source software;simulation;turbulence;velocity (software development);water model	Simon Wolfgang Funke;Patrick E.

This paper is devoted to analyzing the convergence of adaptive mixed finite element methods for the Hodge Laplacian equations based on FEEC without considering harmonic forms. A residual type a posteriori error estimate is obtained by using the Hodge decomposition, the regular decomposition, and bounded commuting quasi-interpolants. An additional marking strategy is added to ensure the quasi-orthogonality, based on which the convergence of adaptive mixed finite element methods is obtained without assuming the initial mesh size is small enough.	finite element method;laplacian matrix	Long Chen;Yongke Wu	2017	SIAM J.

The method is applied to the 4:1 planar contraction benchmark problem, to investigate the influence of the viscosity effects on the flow and results are compared with those found in the literature for creeping Oldroyd-B flows, for a range of Weissenberg numbers. The method is also applied to flow in a smooth stenosed channel. It is shown that the qualitative behavior of the flow is influenced by the rheological properties of the fluid, namely its viscoelastic and inertial effects, as well as the shear-thinning viscosity. These results appear in the framework of a preliminary study of the numerical simulation of steady and pulsatile blood flows in two-dimensional stenotic vessels, using this hybrid finite element–finite volume method. c © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

(J Comput Math 22(1):1–10, 2004), where its accuracy and stability were studied and a linear scalar test problem was analyzed numerically. In the present work, a new step in the implementation of the reciprocal polynomial extrapolation, ensuring at least the same behavior as the Richardson extrapolation, is proposed. Looking at the reciprocal extrapolation as a Richardson extrapolation where the original data is nonlinearly modified, the improvements that we will obtain should be justified. Several theoretical analysis of the new extrapolation, including local error estimates and stability properties, are presented. A comparison between the two extrapolation techniques is performed for solving some boundary problems with perturbation controlled by a small parameter ϵ. Using two specific boundary problems, the error and the robustness of the new technique using centered divided differences in a uniform mesh are investigated numerically. They turn out to be better than those presented by the Richardson extrapolation. Finally, investigations on the accuracy when using a special non-uniform discretization mesh are presented. A numerical comparison with the Richardson extrapolation for this particular case, where we present some improvements, is also performed.	discretization;divided differences;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;reciprocal polynomial;richardson extrapolation;richardson number	Sergio Amat;Sonia Busquier;María José Legaz;Fernando Manzano;Juan Ruiz	2012	Numerical Algorithms	10.1007/s11075-012-9555-0	bulirsch–stoer algorithm;minimum polynomial extrapolation;mathematical optimization;richardson extrapolation;mathematical analysis;calculus;mathematics;extrapolation	Theory	88.3251923732686	13.602145459040967	63032

Theoretical and numerical aspects of the vector radiation transfer equation solution were considered in [1–6]. In particular, in these works, general properties of the boundary problem solution were examined, and numerical and analytical methods for finding it were proposed. The description of effects which appear at the boundaries between different materials is important for the simulation of radiation transfer within a substance. In radiation transfer theory these effects are taken into account through different matching conditions at the boundaries of the medium partition. The boundary problems for the scalar radiation transfer equation with continuous matching conditions for the solution at the boundaries of the medium partition are sufficiently researched [7–9]. Boundary problems with more general matching conditions for the solution, which describe reflection and refraction at the boundaries of the medium division, have been less examined. However, from the fifties in the last century specialists [10–12] repeatedly paid attention to these and different approaches for finding the boundary-value problem solution were proposed [1,4,11,13]. In the papers [14–17] the adequacy of the radiation transfer equation for realistic processes was examined, and its diffusion approximation was proved. In works [18,19], properties of the scalar radiation transfer equation solution with general matching conditions for 1D and 3D were examined. In the present work, the main results of paper [19] are generalized to the vector case. The properties of continuity of the boundary problem solution for the polarized-radiation transfer equation for the layered medium are examined. Theorems of boundary problem solubility and estimates of the maximum principle type are obtained. A numerical algorithm based on the Monte Carlo method for solving the boundary-value problem is proposed. Numerical calculations, which demonstrate the influence of refraction, reflection and scattering on the polarization and depolarization of the radiation, are considered. 1.

Kovtanyuk, I.V. Prokhorov / Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics 235 (2011) 2006–2014 2007 The planes z = zi are the interfaces between the layers Gi. Let us consider the equation of radiation transfer in a layered medium for the azimuthal symmetry case: νfz(z, ν)+ μ(z)f (z, ν) = μs(z) ∫ 1 −1 P(z, ν, ν )f (z, ν )dν ′ + J(z, ν). (1) Here, f (z, ν) = (f1(z, ν), f2(z, ν)) is a two-component vector of polarized radiation at the point z ∈ G in the directionwhose cosine of the angle with the positive direction of the axis z is ν ∈ [−1, 1]. f (z, ν) is associated with the vector of the Stokes parameter (I‖, I⊥) by the following relations: f1(z, ν) = I‖(z, ν) n2(z) , f2(z, ν) = I⊥(z, ν) n2(z) . Here, n(z) is the piecewise-constant refractive index of the medium (n(z) = ni for z ∈ Gi). The sum f1 + f2 describes the density of the radiation flux, f1 ≥ 0, f2 ≥ 0. The functions μ,μs are called respectively the attenuation factor and the scattering coefficient. The two-component vector J describes internal radiation sources, and P is the 2×2 scattering matrix. As for the coefficients in (1), we assume the following. Functions μ,μs, Ji are nonnegative; μ ≥ μmin > 0, and μ,μs ∈ Cb(G0), where Cb(G0) is the Banach space of functions, bounded and continuous on G0, with the norm ‖φ‖Cb(G0) = sup x∈G0 |φ(x)|. We define X = G × {[−1, 0) ∪ (0, 1]}, X0 = G0 × {[−1, 0) ∪ (0, 1]}. We assume that all the components in the matrix P belong to Cb(X0 × [−1, 1] \ {0}), (Pf )1,2 ≥ 0 for f1,2 ≥ 0, and ∫ 1 −1 (pi1(z, ν, ν )+ pi2(z, ν, ν ))dν ′ = 1, i = 1, 2.

A non conservative formulation of the advection equation is employed, in order to achieve a more treatable form of the linear system to be solved at each time step. The method is equipped with a simple p-adaptivity criterion, that allows to adjust dynamically the number of local degrees of freedom employed to the local structure of the solution. Numerical results show that the method captures well the main features of gravity and inertial gravity waves, as well as reproducing correct solutions in nonlinear test cases with analytic solutions. The accuracy and effectiveness of the method are also demonstrated by numerical results obtained at high Courant numbers and with automatic choice of the local approximation degree.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;climate model;computation;discontinuous galerkin method;discretization;dynamical system;finite difference;finite element method;mach;numerical method;semi-supervised learning;semiconductor industry;test case	Giovanni Tumolo;Luca Bonaventura;Marco Restelli	2013	J.

Boussinesq-type nonlinear wave equations with dispersive terms are solved via split-step Fourier methods. We decompose the equations into linear and nonlinear parts, then solve them orderly. The linear part can be projected into phase space by a Fourier transformation, and resulting in a variable separable ordinary differential system, which can be integrated exactly. Next, by an invert Fourier transformation, the classical explicit fourth-order Runge–Kutta method is adopted to solve the nonlinear subproblem. To examine the numerical accuracy and efficiency of the method, we compare the numerical solutions with exact solitary wave solutions. Additionally, various initial-value problems for all the listed Boussinesq-type system are studied numerically. In the study, we can observe that sech 2-type waves for KdV-BBM system will split into several solitons, which is a very interesting physical phenomenon. The interaction between solitons, including overtaking and head-on collisions, is also simulated.	academy;dispersive partial differential equation;experiment;first-order logic;invariant (computer science);nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method;primary source;runge–kutta methods;simulation;soliton;split-step method;switch;type system	Linghua Kong;Lan Wang	2010	Int.

The objective of the present research is obtaining numerical solution of the boundary value problems for dth order linear boundary value problem by a B-spline collocation method using B-splines of order k and their index of regularity is m, d 1 6 m 6 k 2. The collocation points in our method form a strictly increasing sequence of points in 1⁄2a; b , each interior jth collocation point belongs to the interior of the compact support of corresponding jth B-spline basis element, and the number of B-spline basis elements equals the number of collocation points. The order of accuracy of the proposed method is shown to be optimal. The mathematical properties of this collocation method are less well established , primarily because the order of accuracy depends on the regularity and order of B-spline basis and location of the collocation points. The error analysis is through the Green’s function approach than the matrix approach. We compare the efficiency and accuracy of our method to nodal and orthogonal collocation methods as applied to linear ordinary differential equations with boundary conditions. Our collocation method like Greville collocation method is more convenient than nodal or orthogonal collocation because exactly the correct number of collocation points is available. The Greville and Botella collocation methods are special cases of our collocation method. 2007 Elsevier Inc.

ecbe0534bc52591f74f816fbf5f8635ae97d6544	numerical verification of the microscopic time reversibility of newton's equations of motion: fighting exponential divergence		Numerical solutions to Newtons equations of motion for chaotic self gravitating systems of more than 2 bodies are often regarded to be irreversible. This is due to the exponential growth of errors introduced by the integration scheme and the numerical round-off in the least significant figure. This secular growth of error is sometimes attributed to the increase in entropy of the system even though Newton’s equations of motion are strictly time reversible. We demonstrate that when numerical errors are reduced to below the physical perturbation and its exponential growth during integration the microscopic reversibility is retrieved. Time reversibility itself is not a guarantee for a definitive solution to the chaotic N-body problem. However, time reversible algorithms may be used to find initial conditions for which perturbed trajectories converge rather than diverge. The ability to calculate such a converging pair of solutions is a striking illustration which shows that it is possible to compute a definitive solution to a highly unstable problem. This works as follows: If you (i) use a code which is capable of producing a definitive solution (and which will therefore handle converging pairs of solutions correctly), (ii) use it to study the statistical result of some other problem, and then (iii) find that some other code produces a solution S with statistical properties which are indistinguishable from those of the definitive solution, then solution S may be deemed veracious.

Authors requiring further information regarding Elsevier's archiving and manuscript policies are encouraged to visit: a b s t r a c t In this paper, a hybrid boundary element method (BEM) — radial basis integral equation (RBIE) method is derived to solve conjugate heat transfer (CHT) problems. The BEM is used to solve the heat transfer in the solid region, while the fluid region is solved by using the RBIE. The capability of the RBIE to calculate the potential and the spatial gradients, while advantageous when knowledge of the spatial gradients is of primary importance, can lead to unnecessary increases in the computational cost when solving CHT problems due to the additional equations imposed per node. By using the BEM to solve the heat transfer in the solids, a significant reduction in the size of the system matrix compared to the case of using the RBIE for both the heat transfer in the solid and fluid regions can be achieved. A case study that examines the CHT inside the human eye is solved using the derived hybrid BEM–RBIE method.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algebraic equation;algorithmic efficiency;approximation algorithm;archive;boundary element method;boundary knot method;central processing unit;coefficient;computation;computational fluid dynamics;finite element method;gradient;method of fundamental solutions;microsoft word for mac;numerical analysis;numerical method;path integral formulation;personal web page;point of view (computer hardware company);preprocessor;radial (radio);radial basis function;scott continuity;sparse matrix	Ean Hin Ooi;Viktor Popov	2014	Computers & Mathematics with Applications	10.1016/j.camwa.2013.09.020	mathematical optimization;radial basis function;boundary element method;calculus;mathematics;natural convection	AI	90.80642811193033	15.365778896475879	63899

It is also shown how quasi-consistent Nordsieck formulas, which suffer on variable grids from the order reduction phenomenon, can be modified in an optimal way to avoid the order reduction. The latter results in a new class of reducible Nordsieck methods designed here. In addition, we supply our numerical schemes with an automatic global error control mechanism to arrive at the adaptive numerical technique for solving differential equations of preassigned quality. The capacity for deriving numerical solutions satisfying user-supplied accuracy conditions in automatic mode is confirmed by numerical experiments on two test problems.	error detection and correction	Gennady Y.

914e84c8c21cda5d75b67c998f0555212cdfed63	a multi-scale residual-based anti-hourglass control for compatible staggered lagrangian hydrodynamics		Abstract Hourglassing is a well-known pathological numerical artifact affecting the robustness and accuracy of Lagrangian methods. There exist a large number of hourglass control/suppression strategies. In the community of the staggered compatible Lagrangian methods, the approach of sub-zonal pressure forces is among the most widely used. However, this approach is known to add numerical strength to the solution, which can cause potential problems in certain types of simulations, for instance in simulations of various instabilities. To avoid this complication, we have adapted the multi-scale residual-based stabilization typically used in the finite element approach for staggered compatible framework. In this paper, we describe two discretizations of the new approach and demonstrate their properties and compare with the method of sub-zonal pressure forces on selected numerical problems.	augmented lagrangian method;pin grid array	Milan Kucharik;Guglielmo Scovazzi;Mikhail J.

Discretization of the four-field least-squares functional by spectral spaces compatible with the differential operators leads to a least-squares method in which the differential equations are also satisfied exactly. Moreover, the latter are reduced to purely topological relationships for the degrees of freedom that can be satisfied without reference to basis functions. Conventional techniques to improve conservation such as the addition of artificial weights or redundant terms like ∇ × v = 0, are no longer necessary. The final system of equations is a mixture of a finite volume scheme (differential equations) and a higher order finite element method (constitutive relations). Numerical experiments confirm the spectral accuracy of the method and its local conservation, [1].	basis function;discretization;experiment;finite element method;finite volume method;least squares;numerical method	Pavel B.

First, we derive a new blow-up criterion for strong solutions with vacuum, which involves only the $L^p$-norm of $\nabla \mu(\rho)$. As a corollary, the global existence of strong solutions with vacuum is derived for the constant viscosity. The key idea is the utilization of a lemma proved by Desjardins [Arch. Rational Mech. Anal., 137 (1997), pp. 135--158]. Second, in addition to the blow-up criterion, strong solutions are proved to exist globally when the $L^p$-norm of $\nabla \mu(\rho_0)$ is suitably small, even in the presence of vacuum. This improves all of the previous global existence result where the density needs to be strictly positive.	navier–stokes equations	Xiangdi Huang;Yun Wang	2014	SIAM J. Math.

To this end we put forward and compare three possible alternative definitions of Bézier surfaces. We furthermore investigate how to achieve Cand C-continuity of Bézier surface splines. Unlike in Euclidean space and for one-dimensional Bézier splines on manifolds, C-continuity cannot be ensured by simple conditions on the Bézier control points: it requires an adaptation of the Bézier spline evaluation scheme. Finally, we propose an algorithm to optimize the Bézier control points given a set of points to be interpolated by a Bézier surface spline. We show computational examples on the sphere, the special orthogonal group and two Riemannian shape spaces.	algorithm;bézier curve;control point (mathematics);dynamical system;emoticon;german research centre for artificial intelligence;interpolation;patch (computing);polynomial;scalar processor;scott continuity;spline (mathematics);time complexity	Pierre-Antoine Absil;Pierre-Yves Gousenbourger;Paul Striewski;Benedikt Wirth	2016	SIAM J.

I.e., we want to compute the $D$-th derivative tensor $\nabla^D f(X) \in \mathbb R^{N^D}$, where $f:\mathbb R^{N} \to \mathbb R$ is given as an algorithm that consists of many matrix operations. We propose a method that is a combination of two well-known techniques from Algorithmic Differentiation (AD): univariate Taylor propagation on scalars (UTPS) and first-order forward and reverse on matrices. The combination leads to a technique that we would like to call univariate Taylor propagation on matrices (UTPM). The method inherits many desirable properties: It is easy to implement, it is very efficient and it returns not only $\nabla^D f$ but yields in the process also the derivatives $\nabla^d f$ for $d \leq D$. As performance test we compute the gradient $\nabla f(X)$ % and the Hessian $\nabla_A^2 f(A)$ by a combination of forward and reverse mode of $f(X) = \trace (X^{-1})$ in the reverse mode of AD for $X \in \mathbb R^{n \times n}$. We observe a speedup of about 100 compared to UTPS. Due to the nature of the method, the memory footprint is also small and therefore can be used to differentiate functions that are not accessible by standard methods due to limited physical memory.	algorithm;automatic differentiation;computer data storage;first-order predicate;gradient;hessian;memory footprint;software propagation;speedup	Sebastian F.

This equilibrium problem is known to be equivalent to the optimization of a global functional including an L norm of the density. The question arises as to produce a similar model replacing the Lp penalization with an L∞ constraint, but the simplest approaches do not give meaningful definitions. Taking into account recent works about crowd motion, where the density constraint ρ ≤ 1 was treated in terms of projections of the velocity field onto the set of admissible velocity (with a constraint on the divergence) and a pressure field was introduced, we propose a definition and write a system of PDEs including the usual Hamilton-Jacobi equation coupled with the continuity equation. For this system, we analyze an example and propose some open problems.	graph coloring;hamilton–jacobi–bellman equation;jacobi method;mathematical optimization;network congestion;penalty method;scott continuity;velocity (software development)	Filippo Santambrogio	2012	NHM	10.3934/nhm.2012.7.337	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;vector field;mean field theory;calculus;continuity equation;control theory;mathematics;physics;algorithm;quantum mechanics;statistics;algebra	ML	87.43367225379971	13.320179549557698	65171

4cd4c8acfce2c747511eb320b50402768623ecbd	adjoint-based optimal control of time-dependent free boundary problems		In this paper we show a simplified optimisation approach for free boundary problems in arbitrary space dimensions. This approach is mainly based on an extended operator splitting which allows a decoupling of the domain deformation and solving the remaining partial differential equation. First we give a short introduction to free boundary problems and the problems occurring in optimisation. Then we introduce the extended operator splitting and apply it to a general minimisation subject to a time-dependent scalar-valued partial differential equation. This yields a time-discretised optimisation problem which allows us a quite simple application of adjoint-based optimisation methods. Finally, we verify this approach numerically by the optimisation of a flow problem (Navier-Stokes equation) and the final shape of a Stefan-type problem.	coupling (computer programming);discretization;flow network;gradient;iteration;list of operator splitting topics;mathematical optimization;navier–stokes equations;numerical analysis;optimal control;uncontrolled format string;velocity (software development)	Jan Marburger	2012	CoRR		mathematical optimization;combinatorics;free boundary problem;boundary value problem;calculus;mathematics;poincaré–steklov operator	Vision	90.0536776432018	13.347332090724729	65265

This dependence of power-law index on the solution itself causes main difficulties in the analysis of the relevant boundary value problem.

The problem is to evaluate numerically a so-called Fourier integral operator (FIO) of the form ∫ ea(x, ξ) f̂(ξ)dξ at points given on a Cartesian grid. Here, ξ is a frequency variable, f̂(ξ) is the Fourier transform of the input f , a(x, ξ) is an amplitude and Φ(x, ξ) is a phase function, which is typically as large as |ξ|; hence the integral is highly oscillatory at high frequencies. Because an FIO is a dense matrix, a naive matrix vector product with an input given on a Cartesian grid of size N by N would require O(N) operations. This paper develops a new numerical algorithm which requires O(N log N) operations, and as low as O( √ N) in storage space. It operates by localizing the integral over polar wedges with small angular aperture in the frequency plane. On each wedge, the algorithm factorizes the kernel ea(x, ξ) into two components: 1) a diffeomorphism which is handled by means of a nonuniform FFT and 2) a residual factor which is handled by numerical separation of the spatial and frequency variables. The key to the complexity and accuracy estimates is that the separation rank of the residual kernel is provably independent of the problem size. Several numerical examples demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed methodology. We also discuss the potential of our ideas for various applications such as reflection seismology.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;angularjs;cartesian closed category;computation;fast fourier transform;internationalization and localization;kernel (operating system);numerical analysis;regular grid;separation kernel;software propagation;sparse matrix	Emmanuel J.

Propagating uncertainty through nonlinear equations can be computationally intensive for existing uncertainty quantification methods. It usually results in a set of nonlinear equations which can be coupled. The proposed monomial chaos approach employs a polynomial chaos expansion with monomials as basis functions. The expansion coefficients are solved for using differentiation of the governing equations, instead of a Galerkin projection. This results in a decoupled set of linear equations even for problems involving polynomial nonlinearities. This reduces the computational work per additional polynomial chaos order to the equivalence of a single Newton iteration. Error estimates are derived, and monomial chaos is applied to uncertainty quantification of the Burgers equation and a two-dimensional boundary layer flow problem. The results are compared with results of the Monte Carlo method, the perturbation method, the Galerkin polynomial chaos method, and a nonintrusive polynomial chaos method.	monomial;uncertainty quantification	Jeroen A.

The key idea of the proposed algorithm is to first solve the nonlinear system on a coarse mesh, divide the globally fine grid correction into a series of locally linearized residual problems on some subdomains derived by a class of partition of unity, then compute the local subproblems in parallel, and obtain the globally continuous finite element solution by assembling all local solutions together by the partition of unity functions. The main feature of the new method is that the partition of unity provide a flexible and controllable framework for the domain decomposition. Finally, the efficiency of our theoretical analysis is tested by numerical experiments.	algorithm;finite element method	Xiaojing Dong;Yinnian He;Hongbo Wei;Yuhong Zhang	2018	Adv. Comput.

f4b278c91545b57cdf06ffc5344841bb75d4d935	a dissipative particle dynamics method for arbitrarily complex geometries		Dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) is an effective Lagrangian method for modeling complex fluids in the mesoscale regime but so far it has been limited to relatively simple geometries. Here, we formulate a local detection method for DPD involving arbitrarily shaped geometric three-dimensional domains. By introducing an indicator variable of boundary volume fraction (BVF) for each fluid particle, the boundary of arbitrary-shape objects is detected on-the-fly for the moving fluid particles using only the local particle configuration. Therefore, this approach eliminates the need of an analytical description of the boundary and geometry of objects in DPD simulations and makes it possible to load the geometry of a system directly from experimental images or computer-aided designs/drawings. More specifically, the BVF of a fluid particle is defined by the weighted summation over its neighboring particles within a cutoff distance. Wall penetration is inferred from the value of the BVF and prevented by a predictor-corrector algorithm. The no-slip boundary condition is achieved by employing effective dissipative coefficients for liquid-solid interactions. Quantitative evaluations of the new method are performed for the plane Poiseuille flow, the plane Couette flow and the Wannier flow in a cylindrical domain and compared with their corresponding analytical solutions and (high-order) spectral element solution of the Navier–Stokes equations. We verify that the proposed method yields correct no-slip boundary conditions for velocity and generates negligible fluctuations of density and temperature in the vicinity of the wall surface. Moreover, we construct a very complex 3D geometry – the “Brown Pacman” microfluidic device – to explicitly demonstrate how to construct a DPD system with complex geometry directly from loading a graphical image. Subsequently, we simulate the flow of a surfactant solution through this complex microfluidic device using the new method. Its effectiveness is demonstrated by examining the rich dynamics of surfactant micelles, which are flowing around multiple small cylinders and stenotic regions in the microfluidic device without wall penetration. In addition to stationary arbitrary-shape objects, the new method is particularly useful for problems involving moving and deformable boundaries, because it only uses local information of neighboring particles and satisfies the desired boundary conditions on-the-fly.	dissipative particle dynamics	Zhen Li;Xin Bian;Yu-Hang Tang;George Em Karniadakis	2018	J.

A. Friesner, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 102 (2005), pp. 6648-6653]. These methods have been successful in predicting various properties of chemical systems at atomistic scales. Due to the inherent nonlocality of quantum mechanics, the scalability of these methods ranges from O($N^3$) to O($N^7$) depending on the method used and approximations involved. This significantly limits the size of simulated systems to a few thousand atoms, even on large scale parallel platforms. On the other hand, classical approximations of quantum systems, although computationally (relatively) easy to implement, yield simpler models that lack essential chemical properties such as reactivity and charge transfer. The recent work of van Duin et al. [J. Phys. Chem. A, 105 (2001), pp. 9396-9409] overcomes the limitations of nonreactive classical molecular dynamics (MD) approximations by carefully incorporating limited nonlocality (to mimic quantum behavior) through an empirical bond order potential. This reactive classical MD method, called ReaxFF, achieves essential quantum properties, while retaining the computational simplicity of classical MD, to a large extent. Implementation of reactive force fields presents significant algorithmic challenges. Since these methods model bond breaking and formation, efficient implementations must rely on complex dynamic data structures. Charge transfer in these methods is accomplished by minimizing electrostatic energy through charge equilibration. This requires the solution of large linear systems ($10^8$ degrees of freedom and beyond) with shielded electrostatic kernels at each time-step. Individual time-steps are themselves typically in the range of tenths of femtoseconds, requiring optimizations within and across time-steps to scale simulations to nanoseconds and beyond, where interesting phenomena may be observed. In this paper, we present implementation details of sPuReMD (serial Purdue reactive molecular dynamics program), a unique reactive classical MD code. We describe various data structures, and the charge equilibration solver at the core of the simulation engine. This Krylov subspace solver relies on a preconditioner based on incomplete LU factorization with thresholds (ILUT), specially targeted to our application. We comprehensively validate the performance and accuracy of sPuReMD on a variety of hydrocarbon systems. In particular, we show excellent per-time-step time, linear time scaling in system size, and a low memory footprint. sPuReMD is a freely distributed software with GPL and is currently being used to model diverse systems ranging from oxidative stress in biomembranes to strain relaxation in Si-Ge nanorods.	molecular dynamics;numerical method	Hasan Metin Aktulga;Sagar Pandit;Adri C.

b254c9264208f7ee276cb16f2bbe3455a1697751	algorithm for estimating swirl angles in multi-intake hydraulic sumps		Hydraulic Pump sumps are designed to provide a swirl free flow to the pump. The degree of swirl is measured in physical model tests using a swirl meter and a quantity known as swirl angle is generally measured. The present paper presents a novel method to compute the bulk swirl angle using the local velocity field obtained from computational fluid dynamics data. The basis for the present method is the conservation of angular momentum conservation. By carrying out both numerical and experimental studies the novel swirl angle calculation method is validated. Further the effect of vortex suppression devices in reducing the swirl angle is also demonstrated. Introduction Hydraulic pump sumps commonly used in circulating water cooling systems for power generation plants are required to be designed appropriately as it greatly influences the performance of the pumps and their efficiency. A non-uniform approach flow can cause the fluid in the pump intake pipe to swirl. This swirling flow if ingested by the pump can cause noise and vibration, thereby increasing the operational and maintenance costs [1]. A typical multi-intake pump sump consists of multiple inlet channels, a transition region, forebay and pump bay areas. Standards have been evolved for the design of the pump intake by Hydraulic Institute [2] for its satisfactory performance. Hydraulic Institute [2] has also suggested a procedure to perform scaled model tests and assess the quality of flow in the intake pipe using a swirl meter and recommends the measured swirl angles to be limited to less than a prescribed limit. Often due to some constraints in the construction site, certain compromises have to be made that may require some deviations from the suggested dimensions for the pump intake. In such cases, scaled physical model tests are carried put to ensure the adequacy of the design. The pump sump has been studied experimentally using scaled model laboratory tests [3-7]. Such laboratory tests have helped in understanding the vortex formation process, but they are expensive and take time to construct and operate. Further, detailed velocity fields, which would help the engineers to evolve better design of pump sumps, cannot be obtained in experiments. The advancement in high speed computing and development of robust turbulence modelling techniques as well as evolution of accurate numerical algorithms in the last few years have led to the development of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes. These have provided an alternative means to study the hydraulic flow characteristics of pump sumps. There have been several studies [8-12] in the application of CFD to model flows in pump sumps. These studies have been conducted for idealized single intake rectangular geometry. Practical pump sumps however have multiple-intakes and the disturbances in the forebay diffusion area may be carried to the pump thereby altering the flow patterns and inducement of swirls at the pump inlet. While the studies [8-12] have identified the regions of vortex formation and compared them with experiments and described swirl qualitatively (with streamlines), quantification of the swirl in terms of swirl angles that enables comparison of the numerical results with the field data has not been made. Chen and Guo [14] have conducted simulations in the pump sump where the forebay diffusion area was also modeled. The results were benchmarked by comparing the velocity profiles at various locations with the experimental results. The flow was qualitatively analyzed by studying the streamlines and vector plots at various locations in the pump sump. However quantitative results in terms of swirl angles at the pump inlet were not presented. Desmukh et al [15] have conducted simulations on multi-intake hydraulic structures and qualitatively analyzed the flow structure. However rigorous benchmarking of the simulation with experiments was not carried out. From the current literature, it is observed that there is a gap between the way pump sumps are qualified by physical model tests and computation methods. While the former gives a simple elegant quantitative measure for swirl in the intake the later appear to use qualitative measures. It is also surprising that such a void exits considering that these techniques have been coexisting for over two decades. The objective of the present work is to close this gap by evolving a method to quantify the swirl angle as used by Hydraulic Institute from the velocity field obtained from CFD. The CFD analysis is carried out in the commercial code Fluent. This has been made from first principles by using conservation of angular momentum. This method has been qualified using field tests carried out at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. The paper also provides some of the guidelines on the corrective actions that can be implemented to minimize the swirl angles.	algorithm;angularjs;benchmark (computing);commercial code (communications);computation;computational fluid dynamics;computer cooling;emoticon;entity–relationship model;experiment;norm (social);numerical analysis;open road tolling;simulation;stream cipher;turbulence modeling;velocity (software development);vortex;water cooling;zero suppression	Peetak Mitra;Niranjan Gudibande;Kannan N.

996a2355a086c201b5b805489bb6cfe39a2b2379	a pseudospectral based method of lines for solving integro-differential boundary-layer equations. application to the mixed convection over a heated horizontal plate	integro differential equations;pseudospectral methods;method of lines;boundary layer equations	The method of lines is well suited for solving numerically parabolic boundary-layer equations because it avoids the numerical difficulties associated to the integration of the continuity equation, which is subsumed into the momentum equations as an integral of the main velocity component. To deal with these integrals, as well as with any other integral operator entering the boundary layer equations in some particular problems, it is very efficient to discretize the transversal coordinate using pseudospectral methods. The resulting ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can be then written in a very compact form, suitable for general-purpose methods and software developed for the numerical integration of ODEs. We present here such a numerical method applied to the boundary-layer equations governing the mixed convection over a heated horizontal plate. These parabolic equation can be written in such a way that the natural convection appears as an integro-differential term in the usual horizontal momentum equation, so that the discretization by pseudospectral methods of the vertical coordinate derivative is very appropriate. Several Matlab based solvers are compared to integrate the resulting ODEs.

In the first part, the advection component is solved with the help of an extended Jacobian matrix for the coupled system of flow and advection conservation laws and focusing on the correct definitions of the approximate or weak solutions. Considering that one of the conserved quantities is the solute volume, nonphysical solutions for the solute concentration may appear in complex situations and a solute fix is proposed. This is formulated for first and second order schemes. In the second part of this work, the solution of problems with volumetric reaction terms is studied and the results of single-step as well as multi-step pointwise and upwind approaches are compared in order to establish their relative performance. The upwind treatment is done in 2D cases dividing cell volumes to transform reacting terms in singular source terms. The third part is concerned with the diffusion term. The focus of this part is put on the interference between numerical and physical diffusion. A simple form to estimate the magnitude of the numerical diffusion is proposed and it is shown to improve the accuracy of the results in first and second order approaches.	riemann solver	Javier Murillo;Pilar García-Navarro	2011	J.

The key ideas of our approach consist of the following two approaches. First, the interpolation method is implemented by using exponential polynomials with shape (or tension) parameters such that they can be tuned to the characteristics of given data, yielding better approximation than the classical ENO schemes at the same computational cost. Second, we present a new smoothness measurement that can evaluate the local smoothness of a function inside a stencil such that it enables the identification of the smoothest one, while avoiding the inclusion of discontinuous points in the stencil. Some numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed schemes.	algorithmic efficiency;approximation;approximation algorithm;experiment;exponential polynomial;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;polynomial interpolation;smoothing	Youngsoo Ha;Yeon Ju Lee;Jungho Yoon	2013	SIAM J.

141b877f61a5cf4a941f185bf5e9c79b3dcd28da	locally implicit time integration strategies in a discontinuous galerkin method for maxwell's equations	locally implicit time integration methods;discontinuous galerkin spatial discretization;time domain maxwell equations	An attractive feature of discontinuous Galerkin (DG) spatial discretization is the possibility of using locally refined space grids to handle geometrical details. However, locally refined meshes lead to severe stability constraints on explicit integration methods to numerically solve a time-dependent partial differential equation. If the ratio of fine to coarse elements is small, the time step size restriction can be overcome by blending an implicit and an explicit scheme where only the solution variables living at fine elements are treated implicitly. The counterpart of this approach is having to solve a linear system per time step. But due to the assumed small fine to coarse elements ratio, the overhead will also be small while the solution can be advanced in time with step sizes determined by the coarse elements. In this paper, we present two locally implicit time integration methods for solving the time-domain Maxwell equations spatially discretized with a DG method. Numerical experiments for two-dimensional problems illustrate the theory and the usefulness of the implicit-explicit approaches in presence of local refinements.

Dieudonné Mathematics Laboratory, CNRS UMR 7351 † Inria Sophia Antipolis Méditerranée research center, Nachos project-team Méthode Galerkin discontinue et schémas d’intégration en temps localement implicites pour la résolution des équations de Maxwell Résumé : Les méthodes Galerkin discontinues sont particulièrement bien adaptées à la prise en compte de maillages localement raffinés, permettant de considérer avec précision des géométries complexes. Cependant, l’utilisation d’un schéma d’intégration en temps explicite conduit à une restriction importante du pas de temps admissible, ce dernier étant déterminé par les plus petits éléments du maillage considéré pour assurer la stabilité de la méthode. Si le rapport entre le nombre d’éléments fins et grossiers est petit, les restrictions de taille du pas de temps les plus contraignantes peuvent être évitées par l’utilisation d’un schéma d’intégration en temps localement implicite. La contre-partie est de devoir résoudre un système linéaire à chaque itération en temps. Cependant, le rapport entre le nombre d’éléments fins et grossiers étant petit alors le surcoût issu de la résolution du système linéaire sera faible, tandis que la solution peut être avancée avec un pas de temps déterminé par les éléments grossiers du maillage global. Dans ce papier, nous présentons deux méthodes d’intégration en temps localement implicites pour la résolution des équations de Maxwell en domaine temporel, discrétisées en espace par une méthode Galerkin discontinue. Des tests numériques sur des problèmes en dimension deux illustrent la théorie et l’utilité des approches implicite-explicite en présence de raffinements locaux.

After integral transformations, the solution in the explicit form is obtained. For solving the problem, we introduce the notion of the generalized thickness of a layer. This value becomes real in the case of a plane boundary and coincides with an “ordinary” thickness of a layer. If the boundary is curv ilinear, the generalized thickness of a layer becomes a complex value. The use of the generalized thickness of a layer brings about the fact that conditions on infinity (Sommerfeld’s conditions) are automatically fulfilled. The conditions of appearance of loops on the travel-time curves for different boundaries have been elucidated. Some examples of calculations are given. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The scheme is based on a discrete space-time variational formulation and uses an explicit approximative solution as predictor. This predictor is obtained by a Taylor expansion about the barycenter of each grid cell at the old time level in which all time or mixed space-time derivatives are replaced by space derivatives using the differential equation several times. The heat flux between adjacent grid cells is approximated by a local analytical solution. It takes into account that the approximate solution may be discontinuous at grid cell interfaces and allows the approximation of discontinuities in the heat conduction coefficient. The presented explicit scheme has to satisfy a typical parabolic stability restriction. The loss of efficiency, especially in the case of strongly varying sizes of cells in unstructured grids, is circumvented by allowing different time steps in each grid cell which are adopted to the local stability restrictions. We discuss the linear stability properties in this case of varying diffusion coefficients, varying space increments and local time steps and extent these considerations also to a modified symmetric interior penalization scheme. In numerical simulations we show the efficiency and the optimal order of convergence in space and time.	galerkin method;stepping level	Frieder Lörcher;Gregor Gassner;Claus-Dieter Munz	2008	J. Comput.

The more popular approach is to construct a WENO interpolation directly for computing the interface values of the solution. The resulting hyperbolic solver is upstream central in the smooth regions when the nonlinear weights reduce to the optimal linear weights. We refer it to as upwind WENO scheme. On the other hand, based on the same set of multiple lower-order polynomials, the so-called ‘‘Reconstruction via a Primitive Function’’ approach constructs a WENO interpolation to first approximate the derivative of the primitive function of the solution. The resulting WENO interpolation of the interface values of the solution is symmetric with respect to the interface and leads to a central hyperbolic solver in the smooth regions when the nonlinear weights reduce to the optimal linear weights. We refer it to as central WENO scheme. However, both types of WENO schemes are upwind in the non-smooth regions and therefore stable. The stability of a central WENO scheme implies that upwinding is only needed in the non-smooth regions. 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 0096-3003/$ see front matter 2004 Elsevier Inc.

A criterion for selecting relaxation times is found and an empirical convergence rate assessment is carried out to support this result. The proposed methodology is validated by applying it to a network of viscoelastic vessels for which experimental and numerical results are available. The agreement between the results obtained in the present paper and those available in the literature is satisfactory. Key features of the present formulation and numerical methodologies, such as accuracy, efficiency and robustness, are fully discussed in the paper.		Gino I. Montecinos;Lucas O. Müller;Eleuterio F.

While our initial motivation was in response to a recently published solution based on Chandrasekharu0027s H-function, the presentation to follow has taken on a more comprehensive tone. The solution by H-functions certainly did achieved high accuracy but was limited to isotropic scattering and emission from spatially uniform and linear sources. Moreover, the overly complicated nature of the H-function approach strongly suggests that its extension to anisotropic scattering and general sources is not at all practical. For this reason, an all encompassing theory for the determination of highly precise benchmarks, including anisotropic scattering for a variety of spatial source distributions, is presented for particle transport in a half-space. We illustrate the approach via a collection of cases including tables of 7-place flux benchmarks to guide transport methods developers. The solution presented can be applied to a considerable number of one and two half-space transport problems with variable sources and represents a state-of-the-art benchmark solution.	subsurface scattering	Barry D.

0e65608a5a6cab32cf41b85f0f4672ff0470e77e	gradient augmented level set method for phase change simulations		Abstract A numerical method for the simulation of two-phase flow with phase change based on the Gradient-Augmented-Level-set (GALS) strategy is presented. Sharp capturing of the vaporization process is enabled by: i) identification of the vapor–liquid interface, Γ ( t ) , at the subgrid level, ii) discontinuous treatment of thermal physical properties (except for μ ), and iii) enforcement of mass, momentum, and energy jump conditions, where the gradients of the dependent variables are obtained at Γ ( t ) and are consistent with their analytical expression, i.e. no local averaging is applied. Treatment of the jump in velocity and pressure at Γ ( t ) is achieved using the Ghost Fluid Method. The solution of the energy equation employs the sub-grid knowledge of Γ ( t ) to discretize the temperature Laplacian using second-order one-sided differences, i.e. the numerical stencil completely resides within each respective phase. To carefully evaluate the benefits or disadvantages of the GALS approach, the standard level set method is implemented and compared against the GALS predictions. The results show the expected trend that interface identification and transport are predicted noticeably better with GALS over the standard level set. This benefit carries over to the prediction of the Laplacian and temperature gradients in the neighborhood of the interface, which are directly linked to the calculation of the vaporization rate. However, when combining the calculation of interface transport and reinitialization with two-phase momentum and energy, the benefits of GALS are to some extent neutralized, and the causes for this behavior are identified and analyzed. Overall the additional computational costs associated with GALS are almost the same as those using the standard level set technique.	gradient;simulation	Lakshman Anumolu;Mario F. Trujillo	2018	J.

959dfd2a6007bd1572715f9db1c3b8a56b523031	linearity-preserving flux correction and convergence acceleration for constrained galerkin schemes	transport equations;computacion informatica;anderson acceleration;linearity preservation;ciencias basicas y experimentales;matematicas;flux correction;slope limiting;grupo a;discrete maximum principle	This paper is concerned with the development of general-purpose algebraic flux correction schemes for continuous (linear and multilinear) finite elements. In order to enforce the discrete maximum principle (DMP), we modify the standard Galerkin discretization of a scalar transport equation by adding diffusive and antidiffusive fluxes. The result is a nonlinear algebraic system satisfying the DMP constraint. An estimate based on variational gradient recovery leads to a linearity-preserving limiter for the difference between the function values at two neighboring nodes. A fully multidimensional version of this scheme is obtained by taking the sum of local bounds and constraining the total flux. This new approach to algebraic flux correction provides a unified treatment of stationary and time-dependent problems. Moreover, the same algorithm is used to limit convective fluxes, anisotropic diffusion operators, and the antidiffusive part of the consistent mass matrix. The nonlinear algebraic system associated with the constrained Galerkin scheme is solved using fixed-point defect correction or a nonlinear SSOR method. A dramatic improvement of nonlinear convergence rates is achieved with the technique known as Anderson acceleration (or Anderson mixing). It blends a number of last iterates in a GMRES fashion, which results in a Broyden-like quasi-Newton update. The numerical behavior of the proposed algorithms is illustrated by a grid convergence study for convectiondominated transport problems and anisotropic diffusion equations in 2D.	algorithm;anisotropic diffusion;discretization;finite element method;galerkin method;general-purpose modeling;generalized minimal residual method;gradient;limiter;linear algebra;mass matrix;newton;newton's method in optimization;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;series acceleration;software bug;stationary process;variational principle	Dmitri Kuzmin	2012	J.

These iterative procedures provide the solution or an approximation to it as a sequence of iterates. For initial-value problems, it is shown that these iterative procedures can be written in either an integral or differential form. The integral form is governed by a Volterra integral equation, whereas the differential one can be obtained from the Volterra representation by simply differentiation. It is also shown that integration by parts, variation of parameters, adjoint operators, Green’s functions and the method of weighted residuals provide the same Volterra integral equation and that this equation, in turn, can be written as that of the variational iteration method. It is, therefore, shown that the variational iteration method is nothing else by the Picard–Lindelof theory for initial-value problems in ordinary differential equations and Banach’s fixed-point theory for initial-value problems in partial differential equations, and the convergence of these iterative procedures is ensured provided that the resulting mapping is Lipschitz continuous and contractive. It is also shown that some of the iterative methods for initial-value problems presented here are special cases of the Bellman–Kalaba quasilinearization technique provided that the nonlinearities are differentiable with respect to the dependent variable and its derivatives, but such a condition is not required by the techniques presented in this paper. For boundary-value problems, it is shown that one may use the iterative procedures developed for initial-value problems but the resulting iterates may not satisfy the boundary conditions, and two new iterative methods governed by Fredholm integral equations are proposed. It is shown that the resulting iterates satisfy the boundary conditions if the first one does so. The iterative integral formulation presented here is applied to ten nonlinear oscillators with odd nonlinearities and it is shown that its results coincide with those of (differential) twoand three-level iterative techniques, harmonic balance procedures and standard and modified Linstedt–Poincaré techniques. The method is also applied to two boundary-value problems. 2007 Elsevier Inc.

We present the optimal L2 error estimate without any timestep restrictions, while previous works always require certain conditions on time stepsize. A key to our analysis is an error splitting, in terms of the corresponding time-discrete system, with which the error is split into two parts, the temporal error and the spatial error. Since the spatial error is τ -independent, the numerical solution can be bounded in L∞-norm by an inverse inequality unconditionally. Then, the optimal L2 error estimate can be obtained by a routine method. To confirm our theoretical analysis, numerical results in both two and three dimensional spaces are presented.	crank (person);crank–nicolson method;discrete system;finite element method;galerkin method;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical partial differential equations;schrödinger;social inequality	Jilu Wang	2014	J.

For the conforming FEM discretisation with streamline diffusion stabilisation, we derive reliable and efficient error estimators based on the reconstruction of equilibrated fluxes in an admissible discrete subspace of $${H({{\mathrm{div}}},\Omega )}$$H(div,Ω). Error estimators of this type have become popular recently since they provide guaranteed error bounds without further unknown constants. The estimators can be improved significantly by some postprocessing and divergence correction technique. For an extension of the energy norm by a dual norm of the convection part of the differential operator, robustness of the error estimator with respect to the coefficients of the problem is achieved. Numerical benchmarks illustrate the good performance of the error estimators for singularly perturbed problems, in particular with dominating convection.		Martin Eigel;Christian Merdon	2016	J. Sci.

The NavierStokes equations in streamfunction and vorticity formulation are solved numerically using a fine uniform grid mesh of 601 × 601. The steady driven cavity solutions are computed for Re ≤ 21,000 with a maximum absolute residuals of the governing equations that were less than 10−10. A new quaternary vortex at the bottom left corner and a new tertiary vortex at the top left corner of the cavity are observed in the flow field as the Reynolds number increases.

Discretising a continuous method as well as a straightforward discrete neighbourhood based method do not guarantee to return all critical points. Although not all image analysis tasks require the right amount of critical point in mutual relations, it is obviously an advantage to know that all critical points are found. Furthermore, some methods do require the right amount of saddle points in relation to the extrema. The Euler number is an invariant stating explicitly the relation of the number of types of critical points. Using this, one is sure to find the right number of critical points. It is defined on a discrete lattice, so one only has to use the right grid. This appears to be a hexagonal one where each point has six neighbours. An easy way is given to use the hexagonal based critical point detection in a rectangular grid, which is commonly used in computer vision and image analysis tasks. 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In general, the accuracy of these schemes is second-order in time and third-order in time and third in space. Interestingly, there exist a method of the family which is third-order in time. We also consider extensions of the presented difference schemes to a nonlinear problem.

In this paper we introduce a systematic perturbation theory for analyzing the effect of additional small terms on self-focusing, in which the perturbed critical NLS is reduced to a simpler system of modulation equations that do not depend on the spatial variables transverse to the beam axis. The modulation equations can be further simplified, depending on whether the perturbed NLS is power conserving or not. We review previous applications of modulation theory and present several new ones that include dispersive saturating nonlinearities, self-focusing with Debye relaxation, the Davey–Stewartson equations, self-focusing in optical fiber arrays, and the effect of randomness. An important and somewhat surprising result is that various small defocusing perturbations lead to a generic form of the modulation equations, whose solutions have slowly decaying focusing-defocusing oscillations. In the special case of the unperturbed critical NLS, modulation theory leads to a new adiabatic law for the rate of blowup which is accurate from the early stages of self-focusing and remains valid up to the singularity point. This adiabatic law preserves the lens transformation property of critical NLS and it leads to an analytic formula for the location of the singularity as a function of the initial pulse power, radial distribution, and focusing angle. The asymptotic limit of this law agrees with the known loglog blowup behavior. However, the loglog behavior is reached only after huge amplifications of the initial amplitude, at which point the physical basis of NLS is in doubt. We also include in this paper a new condition for blowup of solutions in critical NLS and an improved version of the Dawes–Marburger formula for the blowup location of Gaussian pulses.	asymptote;dispersive partial differential equation;linear programming relaxation;modulation;nonlinear system;optic axis of a crystal;optical fiber;perturbation theory;radial (radio);randomness;schrödinger;technological singularity;transverse wave	Gadi Fibich;George Papanicolaou	1999	SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics	10.1137/S0036139997322407	classical mechanics;spatial variability;singular point of a curve;mathematical analysis;nonlinear schrödinger equation;debye;optical fiber;self-focusing;perturbation theory;oscillation;physics;critical dimension;quantum mechanics;adiabatic process;collapse	ML	86.12402854759631	4.648241530631162	69402

It has found applications in solving quadratic eigenvalue problems and model order reduction of second-order dynamical systems among others. Unfortunately, the SOAR procedure can be numerically unstable. The two-level orthogonal Arnoldi (TOAR) procedure has been proposed as an alternative of SOAR to cure the numerical instability. In this paper, we provide a rigorous stability analysis of the TOAR procedure. We prove that under mild assumptions, the TOAR procedure is backward stable in computing an orthonormal basis of the associated linear Krylov subspace. The benefit of the backward stability of TOAR is demonstrated by its high accuracy in structure-preserving model order reduction of second-order dynamical systems.	algorithm;arnoldi iteration;control theory;dynamical system;instability;krylov subspace;model order reduction;numerical stability	Ding Lu;Yangfeng Su;Zhaojun Bai	2016	SIAM J.

This two-phase PEFC model is represented by a nonlinear coupled system which typically includes a modified Navier-Stokes equation with Darcy's drag as an additional source term of the momentum equation, and a convection-diffusion equation for the water concentration with discontinuous and degenerate diffusivity. For both cases of dry and wet gas channel, we employ Kirchhoff transformation and Dirichlet-Neumann alternating iteration with appropriate interfacial conditions on the GDL/channel interface to treat the jump nonlinearities in the water equation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that fast convergence as well as accurate numerical solutions are obtained simultaneously owing to the implementation of the above-described numerical techniques along with a combined finite element-upwind finite volume discretization to automatically control the dominant convection terms arising in the gas channel.	domain decomposition methods;polymer;two-phase locking	Pengtao Sun;Guangri Xue;Chaoyang Wang;Jinchao Xu	2009	J.

A specific operational differentiation matrix was derived based on the properties of the orthogonal base. Numerical experiments comparing the new approach with the standard collocation methods were also carried out for two models: the trailing vortex model and a laboratory controlled swirl intense flow model. Numerical simulations are included that show good robustness properties of the proposed method. The method proposed in this paper offers two major advantages: affords an extended analysis of complex swirling flow that captures the streamwise development and the upstream extent of the instability and provides a reduced order model of the Tollmien-Schlichting modes used for the global stability analysis. The computational storage is significantly decreased compared with the related application of linear radial collocation approach.	navier–stokes equations	Diana Alina Bistrian	2014	Computers & Mathematics with Applications	10.1016/j.camwa.2014.05.017	mathematical optimization;simulation;control theory;mathematics	ML	91.07282151538294	11.978421621125452	69771

The main idea in the numerical method is to apply the sine pseudospectral discretization for spatial derivatives followed by using an exponential wave integrator for temporal derivatives in phase space. The method is explicit, symmetric in time, and it is of spectral accuracy in space and second order accuracy in time for any fixed ε = ε0 and γ = γ0. In the O(1)-plasma frequency and speed of sound regime, i.e. ε = O(1) and γ = O(1), we establish rigorously error estimates for the numerical method in the energy space H × L. We also study numerically the resolution of the method in the simultaneous high-plasma-frequency and subsonic limit regime, i.e., (ε, γ) → 0 under ε . γ. In fact, in this singular limit regime, the solution of the KGZ system is highly oscillating in time, i.e., there are propagating waves with wavelength of O(ε) and O(1) in time and space, respectively. Our extensive numerical results suggest that, in order to compute ‘correct’ solutions in the simultaneous high-plasma-frequency and subsonic limit regime, the meshing strategy (or ε-scalability) is: time step τ = O(ε) and mesh size h = O(1)-independent of ε. Finally, we also observe numerically that the method has the property of near-conservation of the energy over long time in practical computations.	computation;discretization;in-phase and quadrature components;numerical method;plasma active;pseudo-spectral method;sid meier's alpha centauri;subsonic;time complexity;wave packet	Weizhu Bao;Xuanchun Dong;Xiaofei Zhao	2013	SIAM J.

e0dc3ab8ceced80c7f7132eee9f51b4692b571df	computational modeling of finite deformation piezoelectric material behavior coupling transient electrical and mechanical fields		Abstract This paper develops a finite element formulation and computational model for coupling electric and finite strain dynamic fields with widely discrepant frequencies, governing the behavior of piezoelectric materials. The piezoelectric materials are defined by time-dependent nonlinear constitutive laws. A fully coupled, total Lagrangian finite element formulation is developed for modeling the electric and mechanical fields. A challenge in computational modeling of piezoelectric devices arise due to large discrepancy in the frequencies of the electrical signal and mechanical vibrations, especially when a large number of mechanical cycles need to be simulated. A wavelet transformation induced multi-time scaling (WATMUS) algorithm is developed for dynamic piezoelectric simulations. The WATMUS algorithm projects the high frequency electric fields on to the lower frequency of displacement and velocity fields, on which time integration is performed. The method significantly enhances the computational efficiency in comparison with single time scale integration methods. The accuracy and efficiency of the WATMUS algorithm are validated through piezo-electric applications.	computation;computer simulation;piezoelectricity	Reza Yaghmaie;Somnath Ghosh	2018	J. Comput.

We derive the numerical dispersion relation for a cold plasma drifting with a relativistic velocity, and find an instability attributed to the intersection between beam resonances and the electromagnetic modes in the drifting plasma. The intersection can occur in the fundamental Brillouin zones when EM waves with phase velocities less than the speed of light exist, and from aliasing beam resonances and aliasing EM modes. The unstable modes are neither purely transverse nor longitudinal. The characteristic patterns of the instability in Fourier space for various simulation setups and Maxwell equation solvers are explored by solving the corresponding numerical dispersion relations. Furthermore, based upon these characteristic patterns, we derive an asymptotic expression for the instability growth rate. The asymptotic expression greatly speeds up the calculation of the instability growth rate and makes the parameter scans for minimal growth rate feasible even for full three dimensions. The results are compared against simulation results, and good agreements are found. These results can be used as a guide to develop possible approaches to mitigate the instability. We examine the use of a spectral solver and show that such a solver when combined with a low pass filter with a cutoff value of            |    k   →   |        essentially eliminates the instability while not modifying modes of physical interest. The use of a spectral solver also provides minimal errors to electromagnetic modes in the lowest Brillouin zones.	instability;numerical stability;plasma display;simulation	Xinlu Xu;Peicheng Yu;Samuel F.

The numerical results, obtained in the present work, are found to be in an excellent agreement with the known results, obtained earlier by Ursell (1947), by the use of the closed form analytical solution of the integral equation, giving rise to rather complicated expressions involving Bessel functions.	vertical bar	Rupanwita Gayen;Sourav Gupta;Aloknath Chakrabarti	2016	Appl.

From this equivalence a convergence result for the hierarchical method is induced. Moreover, well-known efficient solution methods for linear systems like relaxation methods can easily be transferred to hierarchical methods providing even more efficient simulation metho,ds.	bottom-up proteomics;computation;computer graphics;conjugate gradient method;global illumination;iteration;iterative method;jacobi method;linear equation;linear programming relaxation;linear system;matrix multiplication;numerical analysis;preconditioner;radiant ai;radiosity (computer graphics);relaxation (iterative method);series acceleration;simulation;system of linear equations;top-down and bottom-up design;turing completeness	Thomas Rauber;Gudula Rünger	1999		10.1145/298151.298434	system of linear equations;radiosity;jacobi method;matrix multiplication;theoretical computer science;numerical linear algebra;linear system;global illumination	Graphics	86.97012522692998	22.75589905237479	70681

Imanuvilov: Controllability of Evolutions Equations, Lectures Notes Series, Vol. 34, Seoul National University, 1996]; this approach has been followed recently for the onedimensional heat equation by the first two authors. More precisely, we minimize over the class of admissible null controls a functional that involves weighted integrals of the state and the control, with weights that blow up near the final time. The associated optimality conditions can be viewed as a differential system in the three variables x1, x2 and t that is second–order in time and fourth–order in space, completed with appropriate boundary conditions. We present several mixed formulations of the problems and, then, associated mixed finite element Lagrangian approximations that are easy to handle. Finally, we exhibit some numerical experiments.	approximation;experiment;finite element method;navier–stokes equations;numerical analysis;numerical method	Enrique Fernández-Cara;Arnaud Münch;Diego A.

For the linearized backwardEuler FEM, anoptimal L2 error estimate is provided almost unconditionally (i.e., when themesh size h and time step τ are less than a small constant). Global mass conservation and electric energy decay of the schemes are also proved. Extension to second-order time discretizations is given. Numerical results in both twoand three-dimensional spaces are provided to confirm our theoretical analysis and show the optimal convergence, unconditional stability, global mass conservation and electric energy decay properties of the proposed schemes.	approximation;discretization;euler method;finite element method;navier–stokes equations;nonlinear system;numerical method;parabolic antenna	Huadong Gao;Dongdong He	2017	J.

In particular, we consider a physically reasonable stored-energy density W such that W (x, μ) goes to infinity for μ ↘ 0 and μ → ∞. The selection criterion for the Young measure is a singular perturbation in form of an interfacial energy with capillarity coefficient ε. We first establish uniform a priori bounds on all solutions of the Euler–Lagrange equation, before passing to the limit for ε ↘ 0. Moreover, the singular perturbation allows us to characterize the support of the Young measure.	calculus of variations;coefficient;elasticity (data store);euler;euler–lagrange equation;jaccard index;nonlinear system	M.

The model is a higher order regularization of the short pulse equation (SPE). The regularization term arises as the next term in the expansion of the susceptibility in derivation of the SPE. Without the regularization term there do not exist traveling pulses in the class of piecewise smooth functions with one discontinuity. However, when the regularization term is added we show, for a particular parameter regime, that the equation supports smooth traveling waves which have structure similar to solitary waves of the modified KdV equation. The existence of such traveling pulses is proved via the Fenichel theory for singularly perturbed systems and a Melnikov type transversality calculation.

43c697de2ebb621c7c8311e6863c8ea84b71a0cd	a reformulation of the conservative level set reinitialization equation for accurate and robust simulation of complex multiphase flows		Abstract This paper presents an accurate and robust reinitialization equation for the conservative level set that does not significantly deform stationary surfaces. The compression and diffusion term of the reinitialization equation are reformulated to use a distance level set directly mapped from the conservative level set. The normals are calculated using a distance level set reconstructed from the interface using a fast marching method, increasing robustness and allowing the use of high order, non-TVD transport schemes. Using this new reinitialization equation, we present results for canonical test cases, such as Zalesaku0027s disk and spurious currents, which show significant improvement. A simulation of a liquid–gas jet with R e = 5000 is also presented to demonstrate the volume conservation properties of the method in more complex flows.	simulation	Robert Chiodi;Olivier Desjardins	2017	J.

The construction follows the natural hierarchical splitting using the fact that the finite element spaces corresponding to two successive mesh refinements are nested. Uniform estimates for the constant γ in the strengthened Cauchy-Bunyakowski-Schwarz (CBS) inequality are very important for the derivation of optimal order methods. The value of the upper bound for γ ? ( 0 , 1 ) is a part of the construction of the multilevel extension of the related two-level method.In this paper algebraic two-level and multilevel preconditioning algorithms for second order anisotropic elliptic boundary value problems are constructed. Here we allow big jumps in the coefficients and varying the direction of dominating anisotropy from one element to another in the coarse triangulation. The discretization is done by trilinear conforming finite elements where the semi-coarsening mesh refinement strategy is applied. A new uniform estimates for the related CBS constants are derived. The additive preconditioning strategy for the system with the pivot block in the hierarchical two-level splitting is proposed, where the related sub-problems have two dimensional structure.	finite element method;preconditioner;semiconductor industry	Ivan Georgiev;Svetozar Margenov	2014	Computers & Mathematics with Applications	10.1016/j.camwa.2014.07.030	mathematical optimization;calculus;mathematics;geometry;anisotropy	Theory	89.29481174828298	14.39828172553494	71331

02ea262eb37e5f4372c65e0d3710e3e13a44b594	flux-splitting schemes for parabolic problems		To solve numerically boundary value problems for parabolic equations with mixed derivatives, the construction of difference schemes with prescribed quality faces essential difficulties. In parabolic problems, some possibilities are associated with the transition to a new formulation of the problem, where the fluxes (derivatives with respect to a spatial direction) are treated as unknown quantities. In this case, the original problem is rewritten in the form of a boundary value problem for the system of equations in the fluxes. This work deals with studying schemes with weights for parabolic equations written in the flux coordinates. Unconditionally stable flux locally one-dimensional schemes of the first and second order of approximation in time are constructed for parabolic equations without mixed derivatives. A peculiarity of the system of equations written in flux variables for equations with mixed derivatives is that there do exist coupled terms with time derivatives.	flux limiter;numerical analysis;order of approximation;parabolic antenna	Petr N.

f60d52208c9a105715aca0908903ddd03aece01a	an advanced numerical technique for a quasi-static electromagnetic field simulation based on the finite-difference time-domain method		Abstract In this paper, an advanced numerical technique is proposed for a low-frequency electromagnetic field simulation. The finite difference time domain (FDTD) method is one of the best methods for analyzing electromagnetic field problems, which require high levels of precision, such as a heterogeneous whole-body voxel human model. However, directly using the standard FDTD method in the quasi-static frequency band requires an extra-large number of iterations. We overcome this drawback using the hybrid of surface equivalence theorem and quasi-static FDTD (QS-FDTD) method. The surface equivalence theorem is used to consider arbitrary shape of source and the QS-FDTD is applied to obtain electromagnetic response quickly in the low-frequency region. The results of the proposed method are in good agreement with those from a commercial electromagnetic simulator. The proposed method is valid where the quasi-static approximation is satisfied.	finite-difference time-domain method;numerical analysis;simulation	Min-Hyuk Kim;SangWook Park;Hyun-Kyo Jung	2018	J.

It is known that if W : Rd → [0,+∞) grows at least linearly at infinity and it has exactly two potential wells of level zero at a, b ∈ Rd, then the Γ(L1)– limit of the family of functionals Fε(u) :=  ∫ Ω ( W (u) ε + ε|∇u|2 ) dx if u ∈ W 1,2(Ω;Rd), +∞ if u ∈ L1(Ω;Rd) \W 1,2(Ω;Rd), where Ω is a bounded, open set in RN , is given by F(u) := { m PerΩ({u = a}) if u ∈ BV (Ω; {a, b}), +∞ otherwise, for a suitable constant m depending on the energy density W . In this paper, and motivated by the study of phase transitions for nonlinear elastic materials, the Γ(L1)– limit is obtained in the case where in Fε(u) the penalization term ε|∇u|2 is replaced by ε3|∇2u|2, for u ∈ W 2,2(Ω;Rd). The resulting functional is of the same form as F(u) above.	nonlinear system;penalty method	Irene Fonseca;Carlo Mantegazza	2000	SIAM J. Math.

The newly proposed HOC exponential FD schemes have nonoscillation property and yield high accuracy approximation solution as well as are suitable for convection-dominated problems. The O(h) compact exponential FD schemes developed for the one-dimensional (1D) problems produce diagonally dominant tri-diagonal system of equations which can be solved by applying the tridiagonal Thomas algorithm. For the two-dimensional (2D) problems, O(h + k) compact exponential FD schemes are formulated on the nine-point 2D stencil and the line iterative approach with alternating direction implicit (ADI) procedure enables us to deal with diagonally dominant tridiagonal matrix equations which can be solved by application of the one-dimensional tridiagonal Thomas algorithm with a considerable saving in computing time. To validate the present HOC exponential FD methods, three linear and nonlinear problems, mostly with boundary or internal layers where sharp gradients may appear due to high Peclet or Reynolds numbers, are numerically solved. Comparisons are made between analytical solutions and numerical results for the currently proposed HOC exponential FD methods and some previously published HOC methods. The present HOC exponential FD methods produce excellent results for all test problems. It is shown that, besides including the excellent performances in computational accuracy, efficiency and stability, the present method has the advantage of better scale resolution. The method developed in this article is easy to implement and has been applied to obtain the numerical solutions of the lid driven cavity flow problem governed by the 2D incompressible Navier–Stokes equations using the stream function-vorticity formulation. 2006 Elsevier Inc.

These schemes employ piecewise polynomial reconstructions, and it is a well-known fact that the use of more compressive limiters or higher-order polynomial pieces at the reconstruction step typically provides sharper resolution. We have observed, however, that in the case of nonconvex Hamiltonians, such reconstructions may lead to numerical approximations that converge to generalized solutions, different from the viscosity solution. In order to avoid this, we propose a simple adaptive strategy that allows to compute the unique viscosity solution with high resolution. The strategy is not tight to a particular numerical scheme. It is based on the idea that a more dissipative second-order reconstruction should be used near points where the Hamiltonian changes convexity (in order to guarantee convergence to the viscosity solution), while a higher order (more compressive) reconstruction may be used in the rest of the computational domain in order to provide a sharper resolution of the computed solution. We illustrate our adaptive strategy using a Godunov-type central-upwind scheme, the second-order generalized minmod and the fifthorder weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) reconstruction. Our numerical examples demonstrate the robustness, reliability, and non-oscillatory nature of the proposed adaptive method.	approximation;computation;converge;godunov's scheme;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);image resolution;jacobi method;navier–stokes equations;numerical analysis;numerical method;polynomial;upwind scheme;viscosity solution	Alexander Kurganov;Guergana Petrova	2006	J.

In our method the underlying boundary element mesh consisting of n elements is decomposed into N submeshes. The related N×N submatrices are assigned to N concurrent processes to be assembled. Additionally we require each process to hold exactly one diagonal submatrix, since its assembling is typically most time consuming when applying fast boundary elements. We obtain a class of such optimal parallel distributions of the submeshes and corresponding submatrices by cyclic decompositions of undirected complete graphs. It results in a method the theoretical complexity of which is O ( ( n / N ) log ( n / N ) ) $O((n/\sqrt {N})\log (n/\sqrt {N}))$ in terms of time for the setup, assembling, matrix action, as well as memory consumption per process. Nevertheless, numerical experiments up to n=2744832 and N=273 on a real-world geometry document that the method exhibits superior parallel scalability O ( ( n / N ) log n ) $O((n/N)\,\log n)$ of the overall time, while the memory consumption scales accordingly to the theoretical estimate.	boundary element method;experiment;graph (discrete mathematics);numerical analysis;population;scalability	Dalibor Lukás;Petr Kovár;Tereza Kovárová;Michal Merta	2015	Numerical Algorithms	10.1007/s11075-015-9974-9	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;boundary element method;discrete mathematics;calculus;mathematics;algorithm;algebra	HPC	91.15279429186214	21.13946967566131	71803
e862534e88d5d5b0a3c0cd3ebfb0b369ea5789b7	a unifying framework for linear estimation: generalized partitioned algorithms		In this paper, generalized partitioned algorithms are presented that serve as the unifying framework for linear filtering and smoothing. The fundamental and all encompassing nature of the generalized partitioned algorithms (hereon denoted GPA) is clearly demonstrated by showing that the GPA contain as special cases important generalizations of past well-known linear estimation algorithms, as well as whole families of such algorithms, of which all previously obtained major filtering and smoothing algorithms are special cases. Specifically, generalized partitioned filtering and smoothing algorithms are given in terms of integral expressions, that are theoretically interesting, computationally attractive, as well as provide a unification of all previous approaches to linear filtering and smoothing, and clear delineation of their inter-relationships. In particular, the GPA for filtering are shown to contain as special cases families of filtering algorithms which constitute generalizations of the Kalman-Bucy, and Chandrasekhar algorithms as well as of the previously obtained partitioned algorithms of Lainiotis. These generalizations pertain to arbitrary initial conditions and time-varying models. Further, the GPA for smoothing are shown to contain two families of generalized backward and forward smoothing algorithms valid for arbitrary boundary conditions, of which all previous backward and forward algorithms are special cases. It is also shown that the GPA may also be given in terms of an imbedded generalized Chandrasekhar algorithm with the consequent computational advantages. Furthermore, the GPA are shown to serve as the basis of computationally effective, fast, and numerically robust algorithms for the numerical implementation of the estimation formulas. A particularly effective doubling algorithm is also given for calculating the steady-state filter. The partitioned numerical algorithms are given exactly in terms of a set of elemental solutions which are both simple as well as completely decoupled, and as such computable in either a parallel or serial processing mode. Moreover, the overall solution is given by a simple recursive operation on the elemental solutions.	algorithm	Demetrios G. Lainiotis	1976	Inf.

More precisely, we consider a special class of discontinuities for which the notion of viscosity solution is well-suited. We propose a semi-Lagrangian scheme for the numerical approximation of the viscosity solution in the sense of Ishii and we study its properties. We also prove an a priori error estimate for the scheme in $L^1$.

The model consists of a set of non-linear partial differential equations by coupling Ginzburg-Landau type phase field equations with convection diffusion type mass balance equations and Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow. In order to incorporate the thermodynamics of the pyrolysis of MTS into phase field model framework, the reduced chemical reaction mechanism is adopted. The microstructure of preferential deposition of Si, SiC under high ratio of H2 to MTS is simulated and the result is in good agreement with the investigation. The potential risk of blockage of the premature pores during ICVI process is predicted. The competitive growth mechanism of SiC grains is discussed.	chemical vapor deposition;computer simulation;experiment;h2 database engine;landau–zener formula;navier–stokes equations;nonlinear system;physical vapor deposition	Yaochan Zhu;Eckart Schnack;Gabriela Iancu	2014	IJITM	10.1504/IJITM.2014.060303	pyrolysis;microstructure;convection–diffusion equation;mass balance;partial differential equation;fluid dynamics	HPC	91.96318233180669	4.4596693906124365	72163

We present a new variant of the Laguerre method based on: (1) using our previously developed variant of the Fourier-series method to calculate the coefficients of the Laguerre generating function, (2) developing systematic methods for scaling, and (3) using Wynn’s ǫ-algorithm to accelerate convergence of the Laguerre series when the Laguerre coefficients do not converge to zero geometrically fast. These contributions significantly expand the class of transforms that can be effectively inverted by the Laguerre method. We provide insight into the slow convergence of the Laguerre coefficients as well as propose a remedy. Before acceleration, the rate of convergence can often be determined from the Laplace transform by applying Darboux’s theorem. Even when the Laguerre coefficients converge to zero geometrically fast, it can be difficult to calculate the desired functions for large arguments because of roundoff errors. We solve this problem by calculating very small Laguerre coefficients with low relative error through appropriate scaling. We also develop another acceleration technique for the case in which the Laguerre coefficients converge to zero geometrically fast. We illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm through numerical examples. Subject classifications: Mathematics, functions: Laplace transforms.

5f88d4301db94d8dd838fcb9bf242587434ce907	an euler-lagrange model for simulating fine particle suspension in liquid flows	mixture incompressibility;euler lagrange model;solid liquid system	This article presents a two-way coupled Euler-Lagrange model to simulate the suspension of fine particles in liquid flows. The goal is to develop a three-dimensional numerical model that is capable of replicating the detailed features of particle-laden turbulent flow. A two-phase fractional-step projection method is developed to ensure mixture incompressibility by solving a modified Poisson equation for pressure, which in turn affects the particle motion through the pressure gradient. An efficient particle-moving algorithm that exchanges particles between Eulerian meshes is developed that automatically retains the necessary particle information at each time step and does not require any Lagrangian particle tracking. A soft-sphere particle collision model is employed to avoid excessive particle overlap and to achieve the random closed packing limit for depositing particles. Since particles are all inherently localized in Eulerian meshes, efficient particle searches can be achieved when calculating particle-particle collision. This model is then used to simulate the gravitational settling of particles, and the results confirm the effect of mixture incompressibility and demonstrate that the model is capable of reaching the random closed packing limit. Numerical examples for the flow problems of particle-induced stratification are conducted, and the model is able to reveal the detailed features of particle-laden flows. Sensitivity on the grid resolution and deviations from the existing single-phase model results are also discussed.	euler;euler–lagrange equation;simulation	Yi-Ju Chou;Shih-Hung Gu;Yun-Chuan Shao	2015	J.

This usually leads to thin components in which damage issues such as thermo-mechanical fatigue, creep and crack propagation can be quite important. The combination of mechanical and thermal stresses usually leads to mixed-mode loading. Consequently, a suitable crack propagation tool must be able to predict mixed-mode crack propagation of arbitrarily curved cracks in three-dimensional space. To tackle this problem a procedure has been developed based on a combined FEM (finite element method) - DBEM (dual boundary element method) approach. Starting from a three-dimensional FEM mesh for the uncracked structure a subdomain is identified, in which crack initiation and propagation are simulated by DBEM. Such a subdomain is extracted from the FEM domain and imported, together with its boundary conditions (calculated by a previous thermal-stress FEM analysis), in a DBEM environment, where a linear elastic multiple crack growth analysis is performed. Once the crack propagation direction is determined a new crack increment can be calculated and, for the new crack front, the procedure can be repeated until failure. The proposed procedure also allows the consideration of the spectrum effects and creep effects: both conditions determine residual stresses that the crack will encounters during its propagation. The procedure has been tested on a gas turbine vane, getting sound results, and can be made fully automatic, thanks to in house made routines needed to facilitate the data exchange between the two adopted codes.	finite element method;software propagation	R.

Such periodic equations are used in the solution of planar elliptic boundary value problems such as those that arise in elasticity, potential theory, conformal mapping, free surface flows, etc. The use of the quadrature methods is demonstrated with numerical examples.	approximation;elasticity (data store);numerical analysis;numerical integration;numerical method;trapezoidal rule	Avram Sidi;Moshe Israeli	1988	J.

Buckling of solutions occurs as the axial load exceeds the first critical value, βc , which turns out to increase piecewise-linearlywith k. Under hinged boundary conditions and for a general axial load P , the existence of a global attractor, along with its characterization, is proved by exploiting a previous result on the extensible viscoelastic beam. As P ≤ βc , the stability of the straight position is shown for all values of k. But, unlike the case with null stiffness, the exponential decay of the related energy is proved if P < β̄(k), where β̄(k) ≤ βc(k) and the equality holds only for small values of k. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, several users have reported that the numerical results of the program become inaccurate when considering a very large source extension or very large epicentral distances. The problem is caused by a technical error in a subprogram (edgwvint.f) of EDGRN. As described in the paper, the Green functions are calculated for a Gaussian disk source instead of a point source. Using the disk source, the numerical Hankel transform, also called wavenumber integral, can converge faster. If the radius of the disk is small enough, say 1% of the epicentral distance, its numerical effect on the Green functions is negligible. For saving computation time, we added an arithmetric IF block (from Line 214 to Line 253) to the subprogram to use different upper cut-off wavenumbers depending on the epicentral distances. Unfortunately, the IF statement used was not correct, because it may also be satisfied by very small wavenumbers which are not negligible for large epicentral distances. It should be mentioned that all results presented in the paper are correct because the error was made after the paper had been completed. The easiest way to correct the error is removing the IF statement, i.e. using a uniform cut-off wavenumber, that will not considerably increase the computation effort. This has been done in the update of the program which is now available at the journal server.	amazon elastic block store;computation;converge;fortran;numerical analysis;server (computing);subroutine;time complexity	Rongjiang Wang;Francisco Lorenzo-Martín;Frank Roth	2006	Computers & Geosciences	10.1016/j.cageo.2006.02.018	computational science;computer science;theoretical computer science	PL	93.19695951063184	16.432753777493303	72522

Such solutions can be sought in the form of power series in a spatial coordinate. We use this approach in problems involving coupled agents. To test the method, we consider a single equation with (a) linear and (b) quadratic diffusivity in order to recover the known results. The original set of PDEs is converted into a dynamical system with respect to the timedependent series coefficients. As an application we consider an expansion of a free turbulent jet. Some example trajectories from the respective dynamical system are presented. The structure of the system hints at the existence of an attracting center manifold. The attractor is explicitly found for a reduced version of the system.	coefficient;dynamical system;emoticon;nonlinear system;turbulence	D. V.

We develop the analysis in both the dissipative and the nondissipative cases, providing indeed a quantitative asymptotic connection between the two regimes. Moreover, we prove the global in time well-posedness for suitable initial and boundary value problems. As a by-product of the well-posedness analysis, we address a variable time-step discretization procedure, proving indeed its convergence and providing some a priori error bounds. Finally, we deal with the asymptotic behavior of the system for large times and establish the convergence of the trajectories to the solution of a suitable stationary problem.	c4 engine;calculus of variations;discretization;nonlinear system;social inequality;stationary process;variational inequality;well-posed problem;whole earth 'lectronic link	Ulisse Stefanelli	2005	SIAM J.

Efficient grid management is an important task in these solvers. In this paper we focus on this problem for discontinuous Galerkin discretization methods in 2 and 3 spatial dimensions and present a data structure for handling adaptive grids of different cell types in a unified approach. Instead of tree-based techniques where connectivity is stored via pointers, we associate each cell that arises in the refinement hierarchy with a cell identifier and construct algorithms that establish hierarchical and spatial connectivity. By means of bitwise operations, the complexity of the connectivity algorithms can be bounded independent of the level. The grid is represented by a hash table which results in a low-memory data structure and ensures fast access to cell data. The spatial connectivity algorithm also supports the application of quadrature rules for face integrals that occur in discontinuous Galerkin discretizations. The concept allows us to implement discontinuous Galerkin methods largely independent of spatial dimension and cell type. We demonstrate this by outlining how typical algorithmic tasks that arise in these implementations can be performed with our data structure. In computational tests we compare our approach with that of a classical implementation using pointers.	algorithm;bitwise operation;cell signaling;computation;cuboid;data structure;discontinuous galerkin method;discretization;hash table;identifier;integer (computer science);newton–cotes formulas;numbering (computability theory);numerical integration;numerical partial differential equations;parallel computing;pointer (computer programming);preconditioner;refinement (computing);requirement;signedness	Kolja Brix;Ralf Massjung;Alexander Voss	2011	SIAM J.

A hybrid method which combines the finite difference method and the differential transformation method is employed to reduce the partial differential equations describing the large deflections of the orthotropic plate to a set of algebraic equations. The simulation results indicate that significant errors are present in the numerical results obtained for the deflections of the orthotropic plate in the transient state when a step force is applied. The magnitude of the numerical error is found to reduce, and the deflection of the orthotropic plate to converge, as the number of sub-domains considered in the solution procedure increases. The deflection of the simply supported orthotropic plate is great than the clamped orthotropic plate. The current modeling results confirm the applicability of the proposed hybrid method to the solution of the large deflections of a rectangular orthotropic plate.	finite difference;householder transformation	Yen-Liang Yeh;Cheng Chi Wang;Ming-Jyi Jang	2007	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2007.01.099	algebraic equation;finite difference;mathematical analysis;plate theory;numerical analysis;boundary value problem;finite difference method;calculus;bending of plates;mathematics;geometry;initial value problem;partial differential equation	Vision	88.49459888303105	10.417954847537167	72809

We obtain the existence and uniqueness of the global solution in a functional setting invariant by the scaling of the associated equations, where the initial velocity has the same critical regularity index as the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, and one more derivative is needed for the deformation tensor. Like the classical incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, one may construct the unique global solution for a class of large highly oscillating initial velocity. Our result also implies that the deformation tensor F has the same regularity as the density of the compressible Navier–Stokes equations.	image scaling;navier–stokes equations;velocity (software development)	Shaobo Zhang;Daoyuan Fang	2012	SIAM J.

As the theory has shown, the ansatz functions for the parameter have to be sufficiently smooth. In this paper we show that these – for a practical implementation unrealistic – smoothness assumptions can be circumvented by reformulating the problem under consideration as a mixed variational equation. We prove convergence as the discretization gets finer in the noise free case and convergence as the data noise level \(\delta\) goes to zero in the case of noisy data, as well as convergence rates under additional smoothness conditions.	calculus of variations	Barbara Kaltenbacher;Joachim Schöberl	2002	Numerische Mathematik	10.1007/s002110100350	mathematical optimization;calculus;mathematics;geometry;parameter;statistics	Vision	84.06963291302458	19.016548772548347	73406

In all these methods, in each iteration, local nonlinear problems are solved on the subdomains. The new approaches can significantly reduce communication and show a significantly improved performance, especially for problems with localized nonlinearities, compared to a standard Newton–Krylov–FETI-DP or BDDC approach. Moreover, the coarse space of the nonlinear FETI-DP methods can be used to accelerate the Newton convergence. It is also found that the new nonlinear FETI-DP and nonlinear BDDC methods are not as closely related as in the linear context. Numerical results for the p-Laplace operator are presented.	algorithm;bddc;balancing domain decomposition method;coarse space (numerical analysis);computation;domain decomposition methods;feti;feti-dp;finite element method;iteration;krylov subspace;newton;newton's method;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;supercomputer;tcp global synchronization	Axel Klawonn;Martin Lanser;Oliver Rheinbach	2014	SIAM J.

In particular one aims for C1-continuity at the patch boundary. The Willmore ene is considered to measure fairness and to allow appropria te boundary conditions to ensure continuity of the norm field. The corresponding L2-gradient flow as the actual restoration pro cess leads to a system of fourth order par differential equations, which can also be written as a syst em of two coupled second order equations. As it is w known, fourth order problems require an implicit time discretization. Here a semi-implicit approach is pre which allows large time steps. For the discretizatio n of the boundary condition, two d ifferent numerical method are introduced. Finally, we show applications to different surface restoration problems.  2004 Elsevier B.V.

However, it has been observed that CG-S may lead to a rather irregular convergence behaviour, so that in some cases rounding errors can even result in severe cancellation effects in the solution. In this paper, another variant of Bi-CG is proposed which does not seem to suffer from these negative effects. Numerical experiments indicate also that the new variant, named Bi-CGSTAB, is often much more efficient than CG-S.	bi-directional text;smoothing;system of linear equations	Henk A. van der Vorst	1992	SIAM J.

However, application of the same CCD method to study the receptivity of a boundary layer experiencing adverse pressure gradient is not successful. This is traced to the nature of the equilibrium flow where the better dissipation property is not helpful in the inviscid part of the flow, where the aliasing problems continue to persist. A further modification is proposed to the CCD method here to solve complex physical problems requiring information on higher order disturbance quantities - as in problems of flow receptivity and instability.	aliasing;charge-coupled device;discretization	Tapan K.

The adaptive algorithm performs both stepsize and order selections to control respectively the solution accuracy and the computational efficiency of the time integration process. The stepsize selection (h-adaptivity) is based on a local error estimate and an error controller to guarantee that the numerical solution accuracy is within a user prescribed tolerance. The order selection (p-adaptivity) relies on the idea that low-accuracy solutions can be computed efficiently by low order time integrators while accurate solutions require high order time integrators to keep computational time low. The selection is based on a stability test that detects growing numerical noise and deems a method of order p stable if there is no method of lower order that delivers the same solution accuracy for a larger stepsize. Hence, it guarantees both that (1) the used method of integration operates inside of its stability region and (2) the time integration procedure is computationally efficient. The proposed time integration procedure also features a time-step rejection and quarantine mechanisms, a modified Newton method with a predictor and dense output techniques to compute solution at off-step points.	backward differentiation formula;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations	Alexander Hay;Stéphane Étienne;Dominique Pelletier;André Garon	2015	J.

The solver is specialized for computational meshes with point singularities in two and three dimensions. Linear complexity is achieved due to utilizing the special structure of such grids. We describe the algorithm and estimate the exact computational cost on an example of a two-dimensional mesh containing a single point singularity.

Firstly a cost functional is constructed by using the measured amplitude of the total field, which is the norm of the discrepancy between the measured amplitude and the calculated one. Then both the amplitude and phase of the scattered field are retrieved by minimizing the above cost functional. Finally, the geometrical and electrical parameters are reconstructed by using the retrieved scattered field. The phase retrieval process can be achieved in a very short time without adding any burden to the whole inverse scattering problem. The equivalent current density is introduced to reduce the nonlinearity of the inverse problem. The reconstruction of the non-radiating component of the equivalent current density improves the imaging quality. Experimental results are presented for the first time to show the feasibility of inverse scattering from phaseless data. The experimental results also show the validity and stability of the proposed method.	discrepancy function;embedded system;mathematical optimization;microwave;nonlinear system;phase retrieval	Wenji Zhang;Lianlin Li;Fang Li	2009	Science in China Series F: Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-009-0029-5	inverse scattering problem;calculus;mathematics;quantum mechanics	AI	89.84983584245309	7.412455007857886	74514

d8ea401f10a2153613b10b430ba40ac88c89328b	symbolic-numerical analysis of the relative equilibria stability in the planar circular restricted four-body problem		We study the stability of relative equilibrium positions in the planar circular restricted four-body problem formulated on the basis of the Euler collinear solution of the three-body problem. The stability problem is solved in a strict nonlinear formulation in the framework of the KAM theory. We obtained algebraic equations determining the equilibrium positions and showed that there are 18 different equilibrium configurations of the system for any values of the two system parameters (mu _1), (mu _2). Canonical transformation of Birkhoff’s type reducing the Hamiltonian of the system to the normal form is constructed in a general symbolic form. Combining symbolic and numerical calculations, we showed that only 6 equilibrium positions are stable in Lyapunov’s sense if parameters (mu _1) and (mu _2) are sufficiently small, and the corresponding points in the plane (Omu _1mu _2) belong to the domain bounded by the second order resonant curve. It was shown also that the third order resonance results in instability of the equilibrium positions while in case of the fourth order resonance, either stability or instability can take place depending on the values of parameters (mu _1) and (mu _2).

The symmetric interior penalty Galerkin (SIPG) method with upwinding for the convection term is used as a discretization method. We use a residual-based error estimator for the state and the adjoint variables. An adaptive mesh refinement indicated by a posteriori error estimates is applied.

We begin by implementing a previously-reported diffuse domain approximation for embedding the domain of interest into a larger domain (Li et al., 2009 [1]). Numerical and analytical tests both demonstrate that this approximation yields non-physical solutions with zero first and second derivatives at the boundary. This excessive smoothness leads to large numerical cancellation and confounds the dynamically-adaptive, multiresolution algorithms inside MADNESS. We thus generalize the diffuse domain approximation, producing a formalism that demonstrates first-order convergence in both near- and far-field errors. We finally apply our formalism to an electrostatics problem from nanoscience with characteristic length scales ranging from 0.0001 to 300 nm.	boundary case;embedded system;multiresolution analysis	Matthew G.

The so-called reshaping process, in which the cylindrical shock is reshaped into a polygonal shock due to the presence of obstacles along the shock path, is studied. To accurately capture the diverse spatial scales of the problem, the computational domain is divided into three sub-domains, namely, the far-field region, the obstacle region and the focus region. Shock propagation in the far-field region is simulated under the axisymmetric, namely, one-dimensional approximation. The obstacle region is described by a fully two-dimensional model, in which initial conditions are interpolated from the far-field. The solution in the obstacle region is then interpolated into the focus region surrounding the center of the imploding shock. These two regions partially overlap to allow for linear interpolation. Numerical results are presented for air in dilute conditions and for four, eight, sixteen and twenty four aerodynamic obstacles. The proposed multi-domain solution technique is found to be capable of describing the complex gas dynamics of the shock propagation and reshaping, while reducing the computational burden for a large number of obstacles of one order of magnitude with respect to fully two-dimensional simulations.	simulation	F.

DNS are numerical solutions of the unsteady (here: incompressible) Navier-Stokes equations that compute the evolution of all dynamically significant scales of motion. In view of the large computing resources needed for DNS cost-effective and accurate numerical methods are to be selected. Here, various-order accurate spatial discretization methods for DNS have been evaluated by applying them to the 2D driven cavity at Re = 22,000. To analyze the results of the DNS of the 2D flow in a driven cavity at Re = 22,000 the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) technique has been applied. POD is an unbiased method to determine coherent structures. The Galerkin projection of the Navier-Stokes equations on the space spanned by the POD-basis-functions yields a relatively low-dimensional set of ordinary differential equations that mimics the dynamics of the Navier-Stokes equations. 3D DNS with no-slip conditions at all walls of the cavity have been performed at both Re = 3,200 and Re = 10,000. The results reproduce the experimentally observed Taylor-Gortler-like vortices.		R. W. C. P. Verstappen;Jan G. Wissink;W. Cazemier;A. E. P. Veldman	1994	Future Generation Comp.

0593b430543a4126f162b3510d2a670a91d90254	a block interface flux reconstruction method for numerical simulation with high order finite difference scheme	high order finite difference method;stability;overlap grid;interface flux reconstruction;computational aeroacoustics	Overlap grid is usually used in numerical simulation of flow with complex geometry by high order finite difference scheme. It is difficult to generate overlap grid and the connectivity information between adjacent blocks, especially when interpolation is required for non-coincident overlap grids. In this study, an interface flux reconstruction (IFR) method is proposed for numerical simulation using high order finite difference scheme with multi-block structured grids. In this method the neighboring blocks share a common face, and the fluxes on each block are matched to set the boundary conditions for each interior block. Therefore this method has the promise of allowing discontinuous grids on either side of an interior block interface. The proposed method is proven to be stable for 7-point central DRP scheme coupled with 4-point and 5-point boundary closure schemes, as well as the 4th order compact scheme coupled with 3rd order boundary closure scheme. Four problems are numerically solved with the developed code to validate the interface flux reconstruction method in this study. The IFR method coupled with the 4th order DRP scheme or compact scheme is validated to be 4th order accuracy with one and two dimensional waves propagation problems. Two dimensional pulse propagation in mean flow is computed with wavy mesh to demonstrate the ability of the proposed method for non-uniform grid. To demonstrate the ability of the proposed method for complex geometry, sound scattering by two cylinders is simulated and the numerical results are compared with the analytical data. It is shown that the numerical results agree well with the analytical data. Finally the IFR method is applied to simulate viscous flow pass a cylinder at Reynolds number 150 to show its capability for viscous problem. The computed pressure coefficient on the cylinder surface, the frequency of vortex shedding, the lift and drag coefficients are presented. The numerical results are compared with the data of other researchers, and a good agreement is obtained. The validations imply that the proposed IFR method is accurate and effective for inviscid and viscous problems with complex geometry.	computer simulation;cylinder seal;disaster recovery plan;finite difference method;instrument flight rules;navier–stokes equations;numerical analysis;software propagation	Junhui Gao	2013	J.

Such a grid is built upon an inflated cube placed inside a sphere and provides an almost uniform grid point distribution. The numerical schemes are based on a high-order variant of the Monotone Upstream-centered Schemes for Conservation Laws (MUSCL) pioneered by van Leer. In each cell the reconstructed left and right states are either obtained via a dimension-split piecewise-parabolic method or a piecewise-cubic reconstruction. The reconstructed states then serve as input to an approximate Riemann solver that determines the numerical fluxes at two Gaussian quadrature points along the cell boundary. The use of multiple quadrature points renders the resulting flux high-order. Three types of approximate Riemann solvers are compared, including the widely used solver of Rusanov, the solver of Roe and the new AUSM^+-up solver of Liou that has been designed for low-Mach number flows. Spatial discretizations are paired with either a third-order or fourth-order total-variation-diminishing Runge-Kutta timestepping scheme to match the order of the spatial discretization. The numerical schemes are evaluated with several standard shallow-water test cases that emphasize accuracy and conservation properties. These tests show that the AUSM^+-up flux provides the best overall accuracy, followed closely by the Roe solver. The Rusanov flux, with its simplicity, provides significantly larger errors by comparison. A brief discussion on extending the method to arbitrary order-of-accuracy is included.		Paul A.

The formulation is in terms of the stress tensor and particle velocities as the unknown field variables. In contrast with the formulation based on particle displacements, this approach leads to integral representations that do not involve derivatives of the unknown fields, thus resulting in simplified and more stable numerics. The numerical procedure is based on suitable quadrature formulas that provide (second order) accurate approximations while retaining the convolution nature of the relevant integrals that make them amenable to efficient evaluation via FFTs. The scheme is further improved through the introduction of (approximation-based) pre-conditioners that are shown to accelerate the convergence of the CG iterations. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methodology.	fast fourier transform;velocity (software development)	Jiaqi Yang;Aria Abubakar;Peter M. van den Berg;Tarek M.

In this model, a porous-medium-type diffusive term and an advection term are in competition. The former induces forward motion, the latter may induce backward motion of the free boundary depending on the direction of advection. We deduce conditions on the growth of the initial data at the free boundary which ensure that at least initially the advection term is dominant. This implies local backward motion of the free boundary provided the advection is (locally) directed appropriately. Our result is based on a new class of moving test functions and Stampacchia’s lemma. As a by-product of our estimates, we obtain quantitative bounds on the spreading of the support of solutions for the chemotaxis model and provide a proof for the finite speed of the support propagation property of solutions.	distribution (mathematics);farkas' lemma;norm (social);software propagation	Julian Fischer	2013	SIAM J.

Both methods are stabilized by the interior penalty method, more precisely by the jump of the gradient in the continuous case whereas in the discontinuous case the stabilization of the jump of the solution and optionally of its gradient is required to achieve optimal convergence. We prove that the solution in the case of the continuous Galerkin approach can be considered as a limit of the discontinuous one when the stabilization parameter associated with the penalization of the solution jump tends to infinity. As a consequence, the limit of the numerical flux of the discontinuous method yields a numerical flux for the continuous method too. Numerical results will highlight the theoretical results that are proven in this paper.	approximation;book;discontinuous galerkin method;finite element method;generalized least squares;gradient;numerical analysis;numerical method;penalty method;upwind scheme	Erik Burman;Alfio Quarteroni;Benjamin Stamm	2010	J.

In the present paper, it is shown that all the eigenvalues do not remain distinct, but become repeated when the elastic medium is free from the initial compressive stresses. Further, the displacements and stresses for an unstressed elastic medium have been independently obtained. The variation of the displacements and stresses due to normal and tangential line load are also shown graphically.

CAA, unlike computational fluid dynamics (CFD), involves the accurate prediction of small-amplitude acoustic fluctuations and their correct propagation to the far field. In that respect, CAA poses significant challenges for researchers because the computational scheme should have high accuracy, good spectral resolution, and low dispersion and diffusion errors. A high-order compact finite difference scheme, which is implicit in space, can be used for such simulations because it fulfills the requirements for CAA. Usually, this method is parallelized using a transposition scheme; however, that approach has a high communication overhead. In this paper, we discuss the use of a parallel tridiagonal linear system solver based on the truncated SPIKE algorithm for reducing the communication overhead in our large eddy simulations. We report experimental results collected on two parallel computing platforms.	acoustic cryptanalysis;computation;computational aeroacoustics;computational fluid dynamics;dns certification authority authorization;finite difference method;large eddy simulation;linear system;overhead (computing);parallel computing;requirement;spike algorithm;software propagation;solver	Yingchong Situ;Lixia Liu;Chandra S.

The kernel of this integral equation is a Green’s function that we compute explicitly for general mechanical systems. We derive conditions under which the integral equation can be solved by a simple and fast Picard iteration even for non-smooth mechanical systems. The convergence of this iteration cannot be guaranteed for near-resonant forcing, for which we employ a Newton–Raphson iteration instead, obtaining robust convergence. We further show that this integral-equation approach can be appended with standard continuation schemes to achieve an additional, significant performance increase over common approaches to computing steady-state response.	computation;continuation;fixed-point iteration;musicbrainz picard;newton's method;nonlinear system;quasiperiodicity;steady state	Shobhit Jain;Thomas Breunung;George Haller	2018	CoRR		mathematical optimization;kernel (linear algebra);steady state (electronics);mathematical analysis;computation;fixed-point iteration;continuation;nonlinear system;mathematics;integral equation;vibration	Robotics	83.74262845133227	17.532338051344606	77123

Topology optimization was originally developed for mechanical design problems, and within the last decade the method has been extended to a range of fluidic applications. In this paper, the Carreau-Yasuda constitutive equation model is used for shear thinning non-Newtonian fluid modeling. The fundamental idea is that the material density of each element or grid point is a design variable, thus, the geometry is parameterized in a pixel-like pattern. Then, material interpolation functions for inverse permeability and dynamic viscosity are used to ensure convergence of the solution and resolve non-linearity. In order to define wall shear stress on implicit boundary between solid and fluid (i.e., blood) occurring in fluidic topology optimization, the relaxation method of wall shear stress is first proposed in this study. We then apply the proposed fluidic topology optimization to actual fluidic systems dealing with blood (e.g., a femoral bypass graft). These design examples validate the efficiency of the proposed approach and show that topology optimization can be used for the initial conceptual design of various fluidic systems.	mathematical optimization;thinning;topology optimization	Jaeyub Hyun;Semyung Wang;Sung Yang	2014	Computers & Mathematics with Applications	10.1016/j.camwa.2013.12.013	mathematical optimization;topology optimization;shear stress;non-newtonian fluid;shear thinning	EDA	92.90695431561416	8.76230199985439	77187

This linear-quadratic optimal control problem entails the minimization of a cost functional that involves point evaluations of the state, thus leading to an adjoint problem with Dirac measures on the right hand side; control constraints are also considered. The proposed error estimator relies on a posteriori error estimates in the maximum norm for the state and in Muckenhoupt weighted Sobolev spaces for the adjoint state. We present an analysis that is valid for two and three-dimensional domains. We conclude by presenting several numerical experiments which reveal the competitive performance of adaptive methods based on the devised error estimator.	dirac delta function;finite element method;optimal control	Alejandro Allendes;Enrique Otárola;Richard Rankin;Abner J.

We analyze the properties of a simple 1D linear system integrated with the symplectic reference system propagator MTS (r-RESPA) technique following earlier work by others. A closed form expression for the time step dependent Hamiltonian which corresponds to r-RESPA integration of the model is derived. This permits us to present an analytic formula for the dependence of the integration accuracy on short-range force cutoff range. A detailed analysis of the force decomposition for the standard Ewald summation method is then given as the Ewald method is a good candidate to achieve high scaling on modern massively parallel machines. We test the new analysis on a realistic system, a protein in water. Under Langevin dynamics with a weak friction coefficient (ζ = 1 ps−1) to maintain temperature control and using the SHAKE algorithm to freeze out high frequency vibrations, we show that the 5 fs resonance barrier present when all degrees of freedom are unconstrained is postponed to ≈ 12 fs. An iso-error boundary with respect to the short-range cutoff range and multiple time step size agrees well with the analytical results which are valid due to dominance of the high frequency modes in determining integrator accuracy. Using r-RESPA to treat the long range interactions results in a 6× increase in efficiency for the decomposition described in the text. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

dfa0714c959d0f89e4cbe198172d82303bce004e	a stable partitioned fsi algorithm for rigid bodies and incompressible flow. part ii: general formulation	fluid structure interaction;added mass;incompressible navier stokes;rigid bodies;partitioned schemes;moving overlapping grids;added damping	A stable partitioned algorithm is developed for fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems involving viscous incompressible flow and rigid bodies. This added-mass partitioned (AMP) algorithm remains stable, without sub-iterations, for light and even zero mass rigid bodies when added-mass and viscous added-damping effects are large. The scheme is based on a generalized Robin interface condition for the fluid pressure that includes terms involving the linear acceleration and angular acceleration of the rigid body. Added mass effects are handled in the Robin condition by inclusion of a boundary integral term that depends on the pressure. Added-damping effects due to the viscous shear forces on the body are treated by inclusion of addeddamping tensors that are derived through a linearization of the integrals defining the force and torque. Added-damping effects may be important at low Reynolds number, or, for example, in the case of a rotating cylinder or rotating sphere when the rotational moments of inertia are small. In this second part of a twopart series, the general formulation of the AMP scheme is presented including the form of the AMP interface conditions and added-damping tensors for general geometries. A fully second-order accurate implementation of the AMP scheme is developed in two dimensions based on a fractional-step method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations using finite difference methods and overlapping grids to handle the moving geometry. The numerical scheme is verified on a number of difficult benchmark problems.	algorithm;angularjs;benchmark (computing);cylinder seal;finite difference method;glossary of sudoku;iteration;navier–stokes equations;numerical analysis;stanford university centers and institutes	Jeffrey W.

Early work on doubly periodic vortex lattices was done by Tkachenko [1] who made use of elliptic function theory (in particular, the special properties of the Weierstrass zeta function) to find the relevant governing equations. He computed the energy associated with a simple vortex lattice of arbitrary shape. Other derivations of the governing equations exist in the literature. Glasser [2] also analyzed rectangular lattices using Fourier series and the properties of theta functions to evaluate various lattice sums of physical interest. Campbell, Doria and Kadtke [3] extended Glasser’s result to arbitrary lattices containing more than one vortex in each periodic cell. O’Neil [4] has derived the velocity in terms of the Weierstrass zeta function, the energy in terms of theta functions and has numerically checked the agreement of his results with those of Campbell et al. Weiss and McWilliams [5] also focus on a doubly periodic square array and derive the equations (differently from the authors mentioned above) by considering a limit of an open domain andmaking use of Laplace transforms and analytical properties of infinite sums. Most recently, Stremler and Aref [6] have looked at the dynamics of a vortex lattice in a doubly periodic planar configuration with three point vortices per period cell. While they againmake use of theWeierstrass zeta function, their derivation differs from earlier ones; they confirm numerically that their equations agree with the results of O’Neil (which, as just mentioned, were checked (numerically) to agree with those of Campbell et al. [3] which, in turn, are known to agree with the results of Weiss and McWilliams [5]). The existence of many different approaches which, moreover, cannot easily be identified with each other (other than numerically) suggests that the matter of deriving the equations of motion is not completely straightforward. In this paper, we focus on the special case of doubly periodic rectangular vortex arrays and present a novel derivation of the equations of motion for this case. We report this new method for three reasons: first, it is of theoretical interest, making use of a preliminary logarithmic transformation which allows us to proceed without the use of elliptic function theory; second, it is essentially elementary requiring no results from special function theory and facilitates a numerical study of the problem requiring no special function packages; finally, the new formulae can be shown, analytically, to be equivalent to existing incarnations of the equations of motion obtained by other authors.	lattice graph;multiphase particle-in-cell method;numerical analysis;oscillator (cellular automaton);relevance;velocity (software development);vortex	Darren Crowdy	2010	Appl.

It can be trivially extended to cylindrical domains. The algorithm uses a mixed Fourier-Compact Finite Difference method. The main advantage of the method is achieved by a new concept of mesh. The topology of the new grid keeps constant the aspect ratio of the cells, avoiding the typical clustering for radial structured meshes at the center. The reduction of the number of nodes has as a consequence the reduction in memory consumption. In the case of fluid mechanics problems, this technique also increases the time step for a constant Courant number. Several examples are given in the paper which show the potential of the method.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);cluster analysis;computation;courant–friedrichs–lewy condition;discretization;division by two;finite difference method;iteration;mesh networking;nonlinear system;order of approximation;parabolic antenna;radial (radio);refinement (computing);requirement;sparse matrix;time complexity	Antonio J.

9e1157690586f316ec33100370bd323e25a234f2	a purely lagrangian method for simulating the shallow water equations on a sphere using smooth particle hydrodynamics		Abstract It has long been suggested that a purely Lagrangian solution to global-scale atmospheric/oceanic flows can potentially outperform tradition Eulerian schemes. Meanwhile, a demonstration of a scalable and practical framework remains elusive. Motivated by recent progress in particle-based methods when applied to convection dominated flows, this work presents a fully Lagrangian method for solving the inviscid shallow water equations on a rotating sphere in a smooth particle hydrodynamics framework. To avoid singularities at the poles, the governing equations are solved in Cartesian coordinates, augmented with a Lagrange multiplier to ensure that fluid particles are constrained to the surface of the sphere. An underlying grid in spherical coordinates is used to facilitate efficient neighbor detection and parallelization. The method is applied to a suite of canonical test cases, and conservation, accuracy, and parallel performance are assessed.	simulation;smoothed-particle hydrodynamics	Jesse Capecelatro	2018	J.

Anisotropic local interpolation error estimates are derived for all these types of element and for functions from classical and weighted Sobolev spaces. The consistency error is estimated for a general differential equation under weak regularity assumptions.

The developed scheme is constructed by making use of the high-order upwind combined compact difference operators, which can preserve the dispersion relation and enhance the convective stability. The scheme is proved to have the unconditional stability and the error accuracy is six order on space and two order on time.

In this paper, we have used Lie transformation group theory to solve (2+1)dimensional Boiti–Leon–Manna–Pempinelli (BLMP) equation. We have obtained some exact solutions of BLMP equation in the explicit form through similarity reduction. All the reported results are expressed in closed form and analysed physically through their evolution profiles. The physical analysis reveals that the nature of solutions is parabolic, quasi-periodic, multisoliton and asymptotic. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Two examples are double barrier option valuation and optimal selling rules in asset trading. We establish the existence of a unique $C^2$ solution of the two-point boundary value problem. We construct monotone sequences of upper and lower solutions that are shown to converge to the unique solution of the boundary value problem. This construction provides a feasible numerical method to compute approximate solutions. An important feature of the proposed numerical method is that the unique solution is bracketed by the upper and lower approximate solutions, which provide an interval estimate of the unique solution function.

Our goal then is to show that the high-frequency part of the corresponding solutions weakly depends on the potential. We will in particular focus on two instances of interest arising in data assimilation and control theory, respectively corresponding to the problem of recovering an initial data from a measurement and to the problem of computing a control. In these two cases, we derive an explicit bound on the error of the high-frequency part of the solution induced by a W (Ω)-error on the potential for s ∈ (0, 1] and p ∈ (max{d, 2},∞]. In order to do that and to express it in a quantified form, we introduce spectral truncations. Our main tool is a commutator estimate.	control theory;data assimilation;truncation	Belhassen Dehman;Sylvain Ervedoza	2014	SIAM J.

The expressions for pressure drop, wall shear stress and resistance to flow have been obtained. The effects of tapering of the tube and the non-Newtonian nature of the fluid on pressure drop, wall shear stress and resistance to flow are discussed. For all fluids, the pressure drop increases with increasing angle of taper from 0.5° to 1° for a given value of yield stress  θ  and tapered tube Reynolds number  Re   ψ  . The resistance to flow as well as the wall shear stress increase with increasing yield stress for Herschel–Bulkley fluid and also for Casson’s fluid when the other parameters held constant.

The general framework is given by the theory of viscosity solutions and, in some cases, of calculus of variations. The schemes proposed here have interesting stability properties for evolutive problems since they allow for large time steps, can deal with degenerate problems and are more accurate if compared to standard finite difference/element methods of the same order. Several examples on classical problems will illustrate these properties.	image processing;semiconductor industry	Elisabetta Carlini;Maurizio Falcone;Adriano Festa	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-34141-0_9	mathematical optimization;viscosity;finite difference;image processing;degenerate energy levels;calculus of variations;mathematics;optical flow;eikonal equation;lagrangian	EDA	84.89631771885274	9.77076876717974	78602

There are numerous explicit and implicit finite difference schemes for solving these problems, and two commonly used schemes are the MacCormack and Saulyev schemes. This paper presents simple revisions to these schemes that make them more accurate without significant loss of computation efficiency. Using advection dominated (high Peclet number) problems as test cases, performances of the revised schemes are compared to performances of five classic schemes: forward-time/centered-space (FTCS); backward-time/centered-space (BTCS); Crank– Nicolson; and the traditional MacCormack and Saulyev schemes. All seven of the above numerical schemes were tested against analytical solutions for pulse and step inputs of mass to a steady flow in a channel, and performances were considered with respect to stability, accuracy, and computational efficiency. Results indicated that both the modified Saulyev and the MacCormack schemes, which are named the Saulyevc and MacCormackc schemes respectively, greatly improved the prediction accuracy over the original ones. The computation efficiency in terms of CPU time was not impacted for the Saulyevc scheme. The MacCormackc scheme demonstrated increased time consumption but was still much faster than implicit schemes. 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The advantage of this representation is to release the softening length for the N-body method and artificial boundary conditions for the spectral methods. With the help of fast Fourier transform, the computational complexity is only O(M(log 2 M)), where M is the number of zones in one dimension. Numerical results show an almost second order of accuracy on a Cartesian coordinate system. A comparison study also demonstrates that this method can calculate the potential for disk surface density based on the uniform grids.	cartesian closed category;computational complexity theory;convolution;fast fourier transform;numerical analysis;numerical method;order of accuracy;softening;spectral method	Chien-Chang Yen	2014	J.

The convergence rate of the semi-analytical method, relative to the number of eigenvalues, is investigated and the effect of varying the interface conditions on the solution behaviour is explored. Numerical experiments demonstrate that solutions can be computed using the new semi-analytical method that are more accurate and more efficient than the unified transform method of Sheils [Appl. Math. Model., 46:450–464, 2017]. Furthermore, unlike classical analytical solutions and the unified transform method, only the new semi-analytical method is able to correctly treat problems with both time-varying external boundary conditions and a large number of layers. The paper is concluded by replicating solutions to several important industrial, environmental and biological applications previously reported in the literature, demonstrating the wide applicability of the work.	semiconductor industry	Elliot J.

The static and dynamic computation of a SAI and a SPAI (Grote and Huckle; 1997), respectively, comes along with advantages like inherent parallelism and robustness with equal smoothing properties (Bröker et al.; 2001). Here, we are interested in developing preconditioners that can incorporate probing conditions for improving the approximation relative to highor low-frequency subspaces. We present analytically derived optimal smoothers for the discretization of the constant-coefficient Laplace operator. On this basis, we introduce probing conditions in the generalized Modified SPAI (MSPAI) approach (Huckle and Kallischko; 2007) which yields efficient smoothers for multigrid. In the second part, we transfer our approach to the domain of ill-posed problems to recover original information from blurred signals. Using the probing facility of MSPAI, we impose the preconditioner to act as approximately zero on the noise subspace. In combination with an iterative regularization method, it thus becomes possible to reconstruct the original information more accurately in many cases. A variety of numerical results demonstrate the usefulness of this approach.	approximation algorithm;box blur;coefficient;computation;data point;discretization;gauss–seidel method;iterative method;jacobi method;matrix regularization;multigrid method;noise reduction;numerical analysis;parallel computing;preconditioner;smoothing;sparse matrix;stellar classification;variable shadowing;well-posed problem	Thomas Huckle;Matous Sedlacek	2010	J.

69c49536b5e5af4676c3b2f136812adc3a5d344b	solving the linear integral equations based on radial basis function interpolation		The radial basis function (RBF) method, especially the multiquadric (MQ) function, was introduced in solving linear integral equations. The procedure of MQ method includes that the unknown function was firstly expressed in linear combination forms of RBFs, then the integral equation was transformed into collocation matrix of RBFs, and finally, solving the matrix equation and an approximation solution was obtained. Because of the superior interpolation performance of MQ, the method can acquire higher precision with fewer nodes and low computations which takes obvious advantages over thin plate splines (TPS) method. In implementation, two types of integration schemes as the Gauss quadrature formula and regional split technique were put forward. Numerical results showed that the MQ solution can achieve accuracy of 1E − 5. So, the MQ method is suitable and promising for integral equations.	approximation;collocation;computation;gauss–jacobi quadrature;gauss–kronrod quadrature formula;gröbner basis;interpolation;newton–cotes formulas;numerical method;radial (radio);radial basis function;the matrix;thin plate spline	Huaiqing Zhang;Yu Chen;Xin Nie	2014	J.

The traditional approach involves dual residual weighting (DRW). In this work we present two new functional error estimators and give conditions under which we can expect them to be asymptotically exact. The first is of DRW type and is derived for meshes in which most triangles satisfy an O(h2)-approximate parallelogram property. The second functional estimator involves dual error estimate weighting (DEW) using any superconvergent gradient recovery technique for the primal and dual solutions. Several experiments are done which demonstrate the asymptotic exactness of a DEW estimator which uses a gradient recovery scheme proposed by Bank and Xu, and the effectiveness of refinement done with respect to the corresponding local error indicators.

Evans, M.M. Martins, The AOR method For AX-XB=C, International Journal of Computer Mathematics 52 (1994) 75-82] and Martins et al. [M.M. Martins, D.J. Evans, M.E. Trigo, The AOR iterative method for new preconditioned linear systems, Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics 132 (2001) 461-466]. In this work, we formulate an alternative group scheme from the AOR family derived from the rotated (skewed) five point formula [G. Dahlquist, A. Bjorck, Numerical Methods, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1974, p. 320; Y. Saad, Iterative Methods For Sparse Linear Systems, second ed., PWS Publishing Company, Boston, 2000, p. 50]. The derivation of this new group scheme is presented and its performance is compared with the existing explicit four-point Group AOR. We include the analysis of the convergence results for the new group scheme. Numerical experiments are also presented to illustrate our results.		Norhashidah Hj. Mohd.

A general dispersion relation is obtained. For Kelvin–Helmholtz instability, it is found that the stability criterion is given by a critical value of the relative velocity. On the other hand, in the absence of gravity the problem reduces to Brinkman model of the stability of two fluid layers between two rigid planes. Vanishing of the critical value of the relative velocity gives rise to a new dispersion relation for Rayleigh–Taylor instability. Formulas for the growth rates and neutral stability curve are also given and applied to air-water flows. The effects of viscosity, porous media, surface tension, and heat transfer are also discussed  in relation to  whether the system is potentially stable or unstable. The Darcian term, permeability’s and porosity effects are also concluded for Kelvin–Helmholtz and Rayleigh–Taylor instabilities. The relation between porosity and dimensionless relative velocity  is  also  investigated .	data-flow analysis	M. H.

The focus is on the direct proof of a discrete inf-sup condition for a low-order test-search space. The low-order finite element spaces in the ultraweak formulation involve the piecewise constant and affine ansatz functions and discontinuous piecewise affine test functions in two and three space dimensions with Neumann boundary conditions or the pure Dirichlet problem. Those lowest-order discretizations for linear elasticity allow for a direct proof of the discrete inf-sup condition and a complete a priori and a posteriori error analysis which is robust in the incompressible limit as $\lambda \rightarrow \infty$. Numerical experiments with uniform and adaptive mesh-refinements investigate $\lambda$-robustness and confirm that one scheme is locking-free.	elasticity (data store);finite element method;galerkin method	Carsten Carstensen;Friederike Hellwig	2016	SIAM J.

It is found that the requirements for the orders of intergrid transfers and the order of approximation of the coarse-grid operators differ in an important way from the well-known “rules” pertaining to elliptic operators. Both Galerkin coarsening and coarsening schemes based on the differential operator are examined, and new coarse-grid correction strategies are suggested in light of this analysis.	anisotropic diffusion;approximation algorithm;coefficient;command & conquer:yuri's revenge;discretization;dual ec drbg;emoticon;first-order predicate;galerkin method;lh (complexity);multigrid method;nl (complexity);numerical analysis;numerical aperture;order of approximation;requirement;truncation;ut-vpn;whole earth 'lectronic link	Irad Yavneh	1998	SIAM J.

Examples include swaptions, which depend on continuous forward curves, and basket options on stocks. Usually, no analytical pricing formulas are available for such products. Numerical methods, on the other hand, suffer from exponentially increasing computational effort with increasing dimension of the problem, the “curse of dimension.” In this paper, we present an efficient approach using partial integrodifferential equations. The key to this method is a dimension reduction technique based on a Karhunen–Loève expansion, which is also known as proper orthogonal decomposition. Using the eigenvectors of a covariance operator, the differential equation is projected to a low-dimensional problem. Convergence results for the projection are given, and the numerical aspects of the implementation are discussed. An approximate solution is computed using a sparse grid combination technique and discontinuous Galerkin discretization. The main goal of this article is to combine the different analytical and numerical techniques needed, presenting a computationally feasible method for pricing European options.

For this purpose, the advection-diffusion equation describing the evolution of contaminant plumes in a 2D horizontal aquifer (Atlantic margin, Rharb Basin of Morocco) is discretized employing a Total Variation Diminishing method (TVD), which provides an efficient way to eliminate spurious numerical oscillations. The stationary velocity field is computed by the ModFlow code using the finite difference method discretization. The initial concentration needed to determine the solution was specified using data from well samples. Numerical examples showing the implementation of the algorithm to describe groundwater contamination by the chloride in the aquifer are presented. This high accuracy method (TVD) constitutes an approach in the water management and allows us to envisage risks of pollution and to manage the groundwater resource from the durable development perspective.	flux limiter;simulation	Hassan Smaoui;Lahcen Zouhri;Abdellatif Ouahsine	2008	Mathematical and Computer Modelling	10.1016/j.mcm.2007.02.006	calculus;mathematics;thermodynamics;oscillation;quantum mechanics	EDA	85.37198891061561	12.148849292190912	80452

The methods are distinguished by the scope and nature of the information used to determine when algorithm termination should occur and which intervals should be selected for refinement. By treating quadrature as the generation and search of a tree whose nodes represent intervals, a unified nonalgorithmi¢ framework is developed which encompasses both approaches. This framework provides a method for improving the numerical properties of local adaptive quadrature with respect to termination of intervals by relative error criteria, and total algorithm termination due to excessive function evaluations. The framework also suggests heuristics for interval selection in global adaptive quadrature that bring the actual error closer to the requested tolerance.

For incompressible isothermal and non-isothermal Stokes equations and Navier-Stokes equations, we develop the associated sensitivity equations for changes in the grad-div parameter. Finite element schemes are devised for computing solutions to the sensitivity systems, analyzed for stability and accuracy, and finally tested on several benchmark problems. Our results reveal that solutions are most sensitive for small values of the parameter, near obstacles and corners, when the pressure is large, and when the viscosity is small.	benchmark (computing);finite element method;gradient;image scaling;navier–stokes equations;numerical analysis;numerical method;simulation;span and div	Monika Neda;Faranak Pahlevani;Leo G.

Optical radiation evolution in time is described by taking into account the first order dispersion. To enhance efficiency and accuracy of the computer simulation, we develop adaptive artificial boundary conditions those use information about the nonlinear Schrödinger equation solution near artificial boundaries. Consequently, our artificial boundary condition uses a local wave number that varies both in time and in corresponding spatial coordinates. As rule, the constant wave number was used in such kind of boundary conditions early. To construct the conservative finite-difference scheme for nonlinear Schrödinger equation with artificial boundary conditions we propose two-step iterative process, because widely used split-step method does not possess conservatism of finite-difference scheme with respect to Hamiltonian of the system. We make a short comparison of mentioned methods for the problem with zero-value boundary conditions.	boundary case;computer simulation;finite difference method;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);iterative method;nonlinear system;schrödinger;software propagation;split-step method;stationary process	Vyacheslav A.

Jiang, and C.W.Shu. Efficient implementation of weighted ENO schemes. J. Comput. Phys., 126:202-228, 1996], the WENOM scheme [A.K. Henrick, T.D. Aslam, and J.M. powers. Mapped weighted essentially non-oscillatory schemes: achieving optimal order near critical points. J. Comput. Phys. 207:542-567, 2005], the WENOZ scheme [R. Borges, M. Carmona, B. Costa, and W.S. Don. An improved weighted essentially non-oscillatory scheme for hyperbolic conservation laws. J. Comput. Phys. 227:3191-3211, 2008] and the scheme, called WENOε here, [F. Aràndiga, A. Baeza, A.M. Belda, and P. Mulet. Analysis of WENO schemes for full and global accuracy. SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 49:893-915, 2011]. The order of weights of these four schemes agreed to the optimal weights is presented in detail. Then three prerequisites are developed if one intends to improve the WENOJS scheme: the scheme arrives the 5th-order at critical points; the weights of scheme approximate the optimal weights with high-order accuracy when solution is smooth; the scheme shouldn’t introduce much oscillations intuitively in the vicinity of discontinuities. According to the prerequisites above, a new WENO scheme (MWENOZ) is devised which is similar to the WENOZ scheme. Finally, the method designed here is demonstrated robustly by applying it to 1D and 2D numerical simulations and its advantage compared with the WENOZ scheme seems more striking in 2D problems.	approximation algorithm;comstock–needham system;contour line;ibm notes;instability;numerical analysis;order of accuracy;polygon mesh;rayleigh–ritz method;simulation	Fuxing Hu;Rong Wang;Xueyong Chen	2016	J.

One such sensor is based on optothermal detection and uses a modulated laser source and a quartz tuning fork resonator to detect trace gases. In this paper we introduce the first mathematical model of such a resonant optothermoacoustic sensor. The model is solved via the finite element method and couples heat transfer and thermoelastic deformation to determine the strength of the generated signal. Numerical simulations validate the experimental observation that the source location that produces the maximum signal is near the junction of the tines of the tuning fork. Determining an optimally designed sensor requires maximizing the signal as a function of the geometry of the quartz tuning fork (length and width of the tines, etc). To avoid difficulties from numerical differentiation we chose to solve the optimization problem using the derivative-free mesh adaptive direct search algorithm. An optimal tuning fork constrained to resonate at a frequency close to the 32.8 kHz resonance frequency of many commercially available tuning forks produces a signal that is three times larger than the one obtained with the current experimental design. Moreover, the optimal tuning fork found without imposing any constraint on the resonance frequency produces a signal that is 24 times greater than that obtained with the current sensor.	crystal oscillator;design of experiments;experiment;finite element method;interactome;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;modulation;numerical analysis;numerical differentiation;numerical linear algebra;optimization problem;piezoelectricity;principle of good enough;quartz (graphics layer);resonance;search algorithm;sensor;simulation	Noemi Petra;John Zweck;Susan E.

(compensated algorithms in floating point arithmetic : accuracy, validation, performances)		Rounding error may totally corrupt the result of a oating point computation. How to improve and validate the accuracy of a oating point computation, without large computing time overheads ? We contribute to this question considering two examples: polynomial evaluation and linear triangular system solving. In both cases we use the compensation of the rounding errors to improve the accuracy of the computed results. 1) Improving the accuracy. We propose a compensated Horner scheme that computes polynomial evaluation with the same accuracy as the classic Horner algorithm performed in twice the working precision. Generalizing this algorithm, we present another compensated version of the Horner scheme simulating K times the working precision (K ≥ 2). We also show how to compensate the rounding errors generated by the substitution algorithm for triangular system solving. 2) Validating the computed result. We show how to validate the quality of the compensated polynomial evaluation. We propose a method to compute an a posteriori error bound together with the compensated result. This error bound is computed using only basic oating point operations to ensure portability and e ciency of the method. 3) Performances of compensated algorithms. Our computing time measures show the interest of compensated algorithms compared to other software solutions that provide the same output accuracy. We also justify such good practical performances thanks to a detailed study of the instruction-level parallelism they contain.	algorithm;cell (microprocessor);central processing unit;computation;coprocessor;data validation;fma instruction set;gnu mpfr;graphics processing unit;horner's method;instruction-level parallelism;interval arithmetic;iterative method;iterative refinement;linear system;numerical analysis;parallel computing;performance;philippe kruchten;polynomial;quadruple-precision floating-point format;refinement (computing);round-off error;rounding;simulation;software portability	Nicolas Louvet	2007				EDA	84.40521703277142	27.966038841609326	81558

It is typical of such problems to assume formal solutions with discontinuities at unknown locations, which justifies the search for a scheme that does not rely on the regularity of the solution. To this end, an auxiliary problem which is equivalent to, but has more advantages then, the original system is formulated and shown that regularity of the solution of the auxiliary problem is higher than that of the original system. An efficient numerical algorithm based on the auxiliary problem is derived. Furthermore, some results of numerical experiments of physical interest are presented. 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

In settings such as fluidstructure interaction it is all the more important to obtain reliable results to understand, for example, the impact of pathologies on blood flows in the cardiovascular system. In this paper, we propose a computational strategy for simulating fluid structure interaction using high order methods in space and time. First, we present the mathematical and computational core framework, Life, underlying our multi-physics solvers. Life is a versatile library allowing for 1D, 2D and 3D partial differential solves using h/p type Galerkin methods. Then, we briefly describe the handling of high order geometry and the structure solver. Next we outline the high-order spacetime approximation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and comment on the algebraic system and the preconditioning strategy. Finally, we present the high-order Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) framework in which we solve the fluid-structure interaction problem as well as some initial results.	approximation;discretization;galerkin method;hemodynamics;lagrangian and eulerian specification of the flow field;linear algebra;navier–stokes equations;preconditioner;simulation;solver;stanford university centers and institutes	Gonçalo Pena;Christophe Prud'homme	2010	J.

4201cd896bbab7c98602be04bb744b6c470b0dfb	automatic recognition and tagging of topologically different regimes in dynamical systems		Complex systems are commonly modeled using nonlinear dynamical systems. These models are often high-dimensional and chaotic. An important goal in studying physical systems through the lens of mathematical models is to determine when the system undergoes changes in qualitative behavior. A detailed description of the dynamics can be difficult or impossible to obtain for high-dimensional and chaotic systems. Therefore, a more sensible goal is to recognize and mark transitions of a system between qualitatively different regimes of behavior. In practice, one is interested in developing techniques for detection of such transitions from sparse observations, possibly contaminated by noise. In this paper we develop a framework to accurately tag different regimes of complex systems based on topological features. In particular, our framework works with a high degree of success in picking out a cyclically orbiting regime from a stationary equilibrium regime in high-dimensional stochastic dynamical systems. ∗Research of JJB partially supported by the Mathematics and Climate Research Network under grant NSF DMS0940363. †Research of MG was partially supported by NSF grants: DMS-1201357 and DMS-0940363. ♦Research of MVJ supported by Toposys grant FP7-ICT-318493-STREP. ar X iv :1 31 2. 24 82 v2 [ cs .C G ] 2 4 M ar 2 01 4 TAGGING REGIMES IN DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS 1	chaos theory;complex systems;dynamical system;ibm notes;mathematical model;mg (editor);nonlinear system;sparse matrix;stationary process	Jesse Berwald;Marian Gidea;Mikael Vejdemo-Johansson	2013	CoRR		dynamical systems theory;simulation;control theory;mathematics	ML	100.53714941663748	5.695205483704454	82009
6b25199ba1018eea92b214d33cea6e9263d767f4	cad model simplification error estimation for electrostatics problems		Simplifying the geometry of a CAD model using defeaturing techniques enables more efficient discretisation and subsequent simulation for engineering analysis problems. Understanding the effect this simplification has on the solution helps to decide whether the simplification is suitable for a specific simulation problem. It can also help to understand the functional effect of a geometry feature. The effect of the simplification is quantified by a user-defined quantity of interest which is assumed to be (approximately) linear in the solution. A bound on the difference between the quantity of interest of the original and simplified solutions based on the energy norm is derived. The approach is presented in the context of electrostatics problems, but can be applied in general to a range of elliptic partial differential equations. Numerical results on the efficiency of the bound are provided for electrostatics problems with simplifications involving changes inside the problem domain as well as changes to the boundaries.	approximation algorithm;approximation error;computer-aided design;discretization;elasticity (data store);experiment;interaction;level of detail;nonlinear system;normal mode;numerical analysis;problem domain;simulation;text simplification	Navid Rahimi;Pierre Kerfriden;Frank C.

ac1f668528d98f6106359ad2b653ec9ff9f3d1af	a new framework of gpu-accelerated spectral solvers: collocation and glerkin methods for systems of coupled elliptic equations	cahn hilliard;spectral galerkin;gpu;cuda;fitzhugh nagumo;system;coupled;spectral collocation	Spectral methods are useful for applications that benefit from high-order precisions. However, if the same number of degrees of freedom is used, the computational cost of a spectral method is considerably higher than that of a general finite difference or finite element method. After the investigation in Chen et al. (J Comput Phys 250:555–564, 2013), we provide for the first time a framework of graphics processing units (GPU)-accelerated spectral methods for systems of coupled elliptic equations. The involved dense matrix computations, as the main obstacle for fast spectral methods on a traditional CPU, turns out to be an opportunity for high speedups on a many-core GPU. We obtain an order-of-magnitude speedup for solving 2-D and 3-D systems using a Kepler 20 GPU over a high-end multicore processor, with two popular spectral methods, namely, the spectral collocation method and the spectral-Galerkin method. The new framework is applicable to systems of L coupled second-order equations with general boundary conditions, where L is an integer of moderate size. The ultimate goal is to apply the developed solver to complex and nonlinear time-dependent problems. As two interesting examples, a 2-D FitzHugh-Nagumo equation is solved with the spectral collocation method and a 3-D Cahn-Hilliard equation is solved with the spectral-Galerkin method. We thus demonstrate a practical solution for demanding problems that utilize high-order spatial resolution and longer run-times.	algorithmic efficiency;cuda;central processing unit;collocation method;computation;computer graphics;entity–relationship model;finite difference;finite element method;fitzhugh–nagumo model;galerkin method;general-purpose computing on graphics processing units;graphics processing unit;kepler (microarchitecture);manycore processor;multi-core processor;nonlinear system;real-time clock;simulation;solver;sparse matrix;spectral method;speedup;unified framework	Feng Chen	2015	J.

Our purpose is to show that the residual is contaminated by old information. The issues investigated here are the eeect of the number of processors, the role of essential neighbors, and synchronization.

The analytical solutions for these model equations are obtained for any order of the nonlinear terms and for any given value of the coefficients of the nonlinear, dispersive and dissipative terms.

41263205f204121ae9cde3d15dae6d31554f5f5b	computational methods for solving the steady flow of a third grade fluid in a porous half space		An important class of fluids commonly used in industries is non-Newtonian fluids. In this paper, two numerical techniques based on rational Legendre functions and Chebyshev polynomials are presented for solving the flow of a third-grade fluid in a porous half space. This problem can be reduced to a nonlinear two-point boundary value problem on semi-infinite interval. Our methods are utilized to reduce the computation of this problem to some algebraic equations. The comparison of the results with the other methods and residual norm show very good accuracy and rate of convergence of our approach. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Combining p-multigrid with static condensation the method achieves nearly linear complexity with an order-independent convergence rate for solving the condensed equations. For smoothing we consider two groups of edge-based relaxation schemes, the best of which attains a multigrid convergence rate of ? ? 0.014 to 0.028. Numerical experiments have been carried out that demonstrate the robustness of the approach for orders up to 32 and a total of 109 degrees of freedom. In comparison with a fast finite difference solver, the latter is clearly outperformed already for errors of one percent or lower.	block cipher;blue (queue management algorithm);computational complexity theory;discretization;emoticon;iterative method;multigrid method;pentium 4;polynomial;preprocessor;rendering (computer graphics);solver;spectral method	L.

First, a two-dimensional Poisson equation with a suitable boundary condition is derived to solve the surface pressure. Consequently, we derive a new formulation of the PEs in which the surface pressure Poisson equation replaces the nonlocal incompressibility constraint, which is known to be inconvenient to implement. Based on this new formulation, backward Euler and Crank–Nicolson schemes are presented. The marker and cell scheme, which gives values of physical variables on staggered mesh grid points, are chosen as spatial discretization. The convergence analysis of the fully discretized scheme is established in detail. The accuracy check for the scheme is also shown.	aharonov–bohm effect;crank (person);crank–nicolson method;discretization;euler;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations;pin grid array;primitive equations	Roger Samelson;Roger Temam;Cheng Wang;Shouhong Wang	2003	SIAM J.

Four important features render this method unique: its stability, its local conservativity, its high-order accuracy, and the exact satisfaction of the incompressibility constraint. Although the method uses completely discontinuous approximations, a globally divergence-free approximate velocity in H(div;Ω) is obtained by simple, element-by-element post-processing. Optimal error estimates are proven and an iterative procedure used to compute the approximate solution is shown to converge. This procedure is nothing but a discrete version of the classical fixed point iteration used to obtain existence and uniqueness of solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations by solving a sequence of Oseen problems. Numerical results are shown which verify the theoretical rates of convergence. They also confirm the independence of the number of fixed point iterations with respect to the discretization parameters. Finally, they show that the method works well for a wide range of Reynolds numbers.	approximation algorithm;converge;discontinuous galerkin method;discretization;fixed point (mathematics);fixed-point iteration;iterative method;navier–stokes equations;numerical method;stationary process;velocity (software development);video post-processing	Bernardo Cockburn;Guido Kanschat;Dominik Schötzau	2005	Math.

Usually, these systems are rankdefficient and (very) ill-conditioned, thus classical direct or iterative solvers can not be efficiently applied. Moreover, because they are relatively dense, classical preconditioning techniques (as e.g. Incomplete Decomposition) become useless. In the present paper we describe an iterative solver for relatively dense symmetric linear systems, in classical or least-squares formulation. The method is based on a modified version of Kovarik’s approximate orthogonalization algorithm. We prove that the sequence of approximations so generated converges to the minimal norm solution of the system. Numerical experiments are described for a collocation discretization of two first kind integral equations, one of them appearing in inverse problems related to determination of charge distribution that generates a prescribed electric field.

Three different models with respect to the density of penetrating ink, constant, linear and exponential distribution, are studied. In addition to the constant model whose differential equations of light propagation can be solved analytically, series solutions corresponding to the linear and exponential models have been worked out. Generally good convergence of the series expansions has been found from simulation. It has been found that to a certain amount printed ink commanded by a printer, the printed image with ink penetration has bigger reflectance than that without ink penetration. Consequently, the range of color reproduction (color gamut) of printed image is reduced due to ink penetration.	color;printer (computing);printing;simulation;software propagation;time complexity	Lei Yang;Björn Kruse	2000		10.1117/12.373417	computer simulation;mathematics;reflectivity;optics;differential equation;quantum mechanics	Graphics	88.53169427596887	5.747762855115591	83801

First, the Galerkin reduced basis (RB) formulation is presented, which fails at providing significant gains with respect to the computational efficiency for nonlinear problems. Renowned methods for the reduction of the computing time of nonlinear reduced order models are the Hyper-Reduction and the (Discrete) Empirical Interpolation Method (EIM, DEIM). An algorithmic description and a methodological comparison of both methods are provided. The accuracy of the predictions of the hyper-reduced model and the (D)EIM in comparison to the Galerkin RB is investigated.

As a physical application, we study the dynamics of two coupled beams, described by coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equations and modeling beam propagation in an atomic coherent media, whose spatial sizes differ up to several orders of magnitude. It is demonstrated, also by numerical simulations, that the accuracy properties of the polynomial-type mapping outperform in orders of magnitude the ones of the other studied mapping functions.	chebyshev pseudospectral method;coherence (physics);interpolation;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;polynomial;pseudo-spectral method;schrödinger;simulation;software propagation	Adrian Alexandrescu;Alfonso Bueno-Orovio;José R.

Among the most promising approaches for complex-geometry problems is the embeddedboundary Cartesian mesh method [1]. In this approach, the discretization of the surface geometry is decoupled from that of the volume mesh, which enables rapid and robust mesh generation, and ultimately, an automatic analysis of aerodynamic performance. The purpose of this work is to extend the automation and efficiency of Cartesian methods to the computation of aerodynamic sensitivities for shape optimization problems. The most common way to account for the effect of boundary shape perturbations in the adjoint and flow-sensitivity formulations is via domain mapping approaches. In implementations on body-fitted structured or unstructured meshes, this involves the use of mesh-perturbation schemes. For local shape deformations, the extent of the mesh perturbations can be limited to just the boundary cells [2, 3, 4]. The approach we propose here for non-bodyfitted Cartesian meshes is similar, but the boundary faces of the volume mesh maintain their Cartesian orientation as the surface evolves. This approach permits the computation of mesh sensitivities via a direct linearization of the boundary-cell geometric constructors of the mesh generator.	cartesian closed category;computation;computer-aided design;discretization;embedded system;engineering design process;first-order predicate;gradient;mathematical optimization;mesh generation;rate of convergence;shape optimization;unstructured grid;volume mesh	Marian Nemec;Michael J.

a8713be942a7e806bd85e94398ac2ffbf894f19c	risk averse elastic shape optimization with parametrized fine scale geometry		Shape optimization of the fine scale geometry of elastic objects is investigated under stochastic loading. Thus, the object geometry is described via parametrized geometric details placed on a regular lattice. Here, in a two dimensional set up we focus on ellipsoidal holes as the fine scale geometric details described by the semiaxes and their orientation. Optimization of a deterministic cost functional as well as stochastic loading with risk neutral and risk averse stochastic cost functionals are discussed. Under the assumption of linear elasticity and quadratic objective functions the computational cost scales linearly in the number of basis loads spanning the possibly large set of all realizations of the stochastic loading. The resulting shape optimization algorithm consists of a finite dimensional, constraint optimization scheme where the cost functional and its gradient are evaluated applying a boundary element method on the fine scale geometry. Various numerical results show the spatial variation of the geometric domain structures and the appearance of strongly anisotropic patterns.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;boundary element method;computation;constrained optimization;elasticity (data store);file spanning;gradient;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;risk aversion;shape optimization	Benedict Geihe;Martin Lenz;Martin Rumpf;Rüdiger Schultz	2013	Math.

It is found that compared with the more popular fifth-order polynomial fit of the interface values, a piecewise quadratic reconstruction of the solution with more accurate slope and curvature, especially those computed by compact difference schemes, is much less dissipative. Therefore, further given in the paper is a general framework to make a piecewise quadratic reconstruction free of numerical oscillations around the shocks. The improved accuracy and robustness of the resulting Godunov-type schemes for simulation of vortex-dominated flows are demonstrated with the numerical results of several carefully selected cases, including vortex convection and shock–vortex interaction. 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The first-order derivative in the left boundary point is approximated by the cubic spline. This scheme is applied on the boundary layer resolving Shishkin mesh.

ab9ff725a5a05eefddfeba9f2a7b985d1ad21d5e	phase-field modeling of brittle fracture with multi-level hp-fem and the finite cell method		The difficulties in dealing with discontinuities related to a sharp crack are overcome in the phasefield approach for fracture by modeling the crack as a diffusive object being described by a continuous field having high gradients. The discrete crack limit case is approached for a small lengthscale parameter that controls the width of the transition region between the fully broken and the undamaged phases. From a computational standpoint, this necessitates fine meshes, at least locally, in order to accurately resolve the phasefield profile. In the classical approach, phasefield models are computed on a fixed mesh that is a priori refined in the areas where the crack is expected to propagate. This on the other hand curbs the convenience of using phase-field models for unknown crack paths and its ability to handle complex crack propagation patterns. In this work, we overcome this issue by employing the multi-level hp-refinement technique that enables a dynamically changing mesh which in turn allows the refinement to remain local at singularities and high gradients without problems of hanging nodes. Yet, in case of complex geometries, mesh generation and in particular local refinement becomes non-trivial. We address this is∗ Corresponding author. E-mail address: s.nagaraja@tu-braunschweig.de sue by integrating a two-dimensional phase-field framework for brittle fracture with the finite cell method (FCM). The FCM based on high-order finite elements is a non-geometry-conforming discretization technique wherein the physical domain is embedded into a larger fictitious domain of simple geometry that can be easily discretized. This facilitates mesh generation for complex geometries and supports local refinement. Numerical examples including a comparison to a validation experiment illustrate the applicability of the multi-level hp-refinement and the FCM in the context of phase-field simulations.	adaptive mesh refinement;computation;discretization;embedded system;finite element method;fuzzy cognitive map;gradient;heuristic;mesh generation;microsoft outlook for mac;numerical analysis;numerical method;polynomial;refinement (computing);simulation;software propagation;subdivision surface	Sindhu Nagaraja;Mohamed Elhaddad;Marreddy Ambati;Stefan Kollmannsberger;Laura De Lorenzis;Ernst Rank	2018	CoRR	10.1007/s00466-018-1649-7	mathematical optimization;brittleness;mesh generation;fracture mechanics;finite element method;discretization;mathematics;hp-fem;classification of discontinuities;polygon mesh	Graphics	93.97949487837077	9.208212604376884	84648

The Hamiltonian formulism is discovered for it. We first discretize the Hamiltonian system in space to reduce it to a finite-dimensional one. Then the symplectic midpoint scheme is applied to the temporal discretization. The symplectic scheme we devise is of second order accuracy in time and 2lth order accuracy in space. It is proved that it preserves the charge of the original equation veraciously. The energy is not preserved explicitly for the exception of the linear case. However, after some computation, the energy transit formula in the temporal direction is obtained. In the numerical part, we compare our scheme with some existing schemes, including the leap frog scheme and the energypreserving scheme. From the numerical evidence, we find that our numerical schemes are efficient and available.The numerical results are consistent with the theoretical analysis. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The latter package also employs continuous MIRK (CMIRK) schemes to provide C continuous approximate solutions. The particular schemes implemented in these codes come, in general, from multi-parameter families and, in some cases, do not represent optimal choices from these families. In this paper, several optimization criteria are identified and applied in the derivation of optimal MIRK and CMIRK schemes for orders 1–6. In some cases the schemes obtained result from the analysis of existent multi-parameter families; in other cases new families are derived from which specific optimal schemes are then obtained. New MIRK and CMIRK schemes are presented which are superior to those currently available. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the practical improvements that can be obtained by employing the optimal schemes.	approximation algorithm;code;discretization;linux/rk;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;numerical method;numerical partial differential equations;runge–kutta methods;whole earth 'lectronic link	Paul H.

70e159b7a04c50845484e23ddff68316cdb45370	a novel solver for the generalized riemann problem based on a simplified lefloch-raviart expansion and a local space-time discontinuous galerkin formulation		In a wide class of high order shock-capturing methods for hyperbolic conservation laws, the solution of the conservation law is represented at each time-step by a piecewise smooth function (say, a polynomial reconstructed from cell-averages or an approximation in a finite element space). To maintain a sharp resolution of shock waves, jumps at the cell boundaries are allowed. The resulting initial value problem with piecewise smooth but discontinuous initial data is called the generalized Riemann problem. We present a new solver for the generalized Riemann problem based on a simplified version of a local asymptotic series expansion constructed by LeFloch and Raviart (Ann Inst H Poincare Anal Non Lineaire 5:179–207, 1988). Contrary to the original approach, in our new solver no higher order flux derivatives and other nonlinear terms need to be computed. Moreover, we introduce a new variant of the local space–time DG method of Dumbser et al. (J Comput Phys 227:3971–4001, 2008), that allows us to use a direct solution strategy for the generalized Riemann problem without relying on a Cauchy–Kovalevskaya procedure for the flux computation.	galerkin method;riemann problem;solver	Claus R.

However, this mechanism is often discarded for high-order LB models due to multi-speed lattices. Here, we propose a new way of implementing the diffuse reflection boundary condition that can maintain the characteristic streaming-collision mechanism for high-order models. It is then tested on four lattice models, namely D2Q16, D2Q17, D2Q37 and D3Q121 for isothermal and thermal Couette flows and lid-driven cavity flows. Our implementation is shown to be able to achieve second-order accuracy globally.	diffuse reflection;lattice boltzmann methods	Jianping Meng;Yonghao Zhang	2014	J. Comput.

90c9e5a65de953abe61f37ec6d88403451efa58f	a fully coupled multiphase flow and geomechanics solver for highly heterogeneous porous media	heterogeneous media;computacion informatica;fem;coupled multiphase flow and geomechanics;ciencias basicas y experimentales;matematicas;grupo a	This paper introduces a fully coupledmultiphase flow and geomechanics solver that can be applied to modeling highly heterogeneous porous media. Multiphase flow in deformable porous media is a multiphysics problem that considers the flow physics and rock physics simultaneously. Tomodel this problem, themultiphase flow equations and geomechanical equilibrium equation must be tightly coupled. Conventional finite element modeling of coupled flow and geomechanics does not conserve mass locally since it uses continuous basis functions.Mixed finite element discretization that satisfies localmass conservation of the flow equation can be a good solution for this problem. In addition, the stabilized finite element method for discretizing the saturation equation minimizes numerical diffusion and provides better resolution of saturation solution. In this work, we developed a coupled multiphase flow and geomechanics solver that solves fully coupled governing equations, namely pressure, velocity, saturation, and geomechanical equilibrium equations. The solver can deal with full tensor permeability and elastic stiffness for modeling a highly heterogeneous reservoir system. The results of the numerical experiments are very encouraging. We used the solver to simulate a reservoir system that has very heterogeneous permeability and elastic stiffness fields and found that the numerical solution captures the complex multiphysics of the system. In addition, we obtained higher resolution of saturation solution than with the conventional finite volume discretization. This would help us make a better estimate of the numerical solution of complex multiphysics problems. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this problem the random inputs arise due to uncertainties in cross section, initial data or boundary data. We use the generalized polynomial chaos based stochastic Galerkin (gPC-SG) method, which is combined with the micro-macro decomposition based deterministic AP framework in order to handle efficiently the diffusive regime. For linearized problem we prove the regularity of the solution in the random space and consequently the spectral accuracy of the gPC-SG method. We also prove the uniform (in the mean free path) linear stability for the space-time discretizations. Several numerical tests are presented to show the efficiency and accuracy of proposed scheme, especially in the diffusive regime.	asymptote;cross section (geometry);feudalism;galerkin method;numerical analysis;polynomial;suicidegirls	Shi Jin;Hanqing Lu	2017	J.

The truncation error is estimated by restricting the solution obtained on a given grid to a coarser grid and calculating the image of the discrete Navier – Stokes operator of the coarse grid on the restricted velocity and pressure field. The proposed methodology is not a new concept but its application to colocated finite volume discretisations of the incompressible Navier – Stokes equations is made possible by the introduction of a variant of the momentum interpolation technique for mass fluxes where the pressure-part of the mass fluxes is not dependent on the coefficients of the linearised momentum equations. The theory presented is supported by a number of numerical experiments. The methodology is developed for two-dimensional flows, but extension to three-dimensional cases should not pose problems.	coefficient;colocation centre;discrete system;discretization;experiment;finite volume method;interpolation;navier–stokes equations;norm (social);numerical analysis;order of approximation;truncation error;velocity (software development)	Alexandros Syrakos;Apostolos Goulas	2015	CoRR	10.1002/fld.1038	three-dimensional space;mesh generation;mathematical optimization;annulus;pressure-correction method;computational fluid dynamics;interpolation;calculus;compressibility;mathematics;geometry;truncation error;momentum;finite volume method;physics	HPC	87.86316105517969	9.73304167677534	85184

By using a certain ‘multiple Arnoldi process’ over all stages the order of the fully-implicit one-step scheme can be preserved with low Krylov dimensions. Explicit estimates for minimal order preserving dimensions are derived. They depend on the parameters of the method only, not on the dimension of the ODE. Stability restrictions usually require larger dimensions, of course, but this can be done adaptively. These results justify to adopt the step size control of the underlying ROW-method. The widely used ROW-methods of order 4 are discussed in detail and numerical illustrations are given. For the special class of semilinear systems with stiffness in a constant linear part we establish the order 2 of B-consistency for these Krylov-W-methods.	arnoldi iteration;commutation theorem;krylov subspace;krylov–bogolyubov theorem;numerical analysis;numerical stability;open dynamics engine	Rüdiger Weiner;Bernhard A.

After the separation of variables we obtain second order ordinary differential equations, so that automatic methods for finding a closed-form solution are needed. We present a symbolic algorithm implemented in Maple based on the method of indeterminate coefficients, which reduces the obtained equations to the well-known differential equations. The latter can be solved in terms of hypergeometric or Bessel functions. The usage of indeterminate coefficients allows one to obtain the solution of the problem equations in terms of control parameters, which can then be choosen according to the purposes of a nanotechological process.	quantum dot;symbolic computation	Dmytro Chibisov;Victor G.

The model for the plate mirrors what has been done for the rod. Asymptotic expansions are formulated for the displacement field and a rate equation governing the deposition and reabsorption of bone tissue. It is shown that both asymptotic expansions can be simplified and certain relationships can be derived from the force balance equation.

We have recently developed a method for the optimization problem in which stationary states are obtained by solving the pseudo-stationary system of equations representing state, costate, and design equations. The method requires no additional globalization techniques in the design space and a reduced sequential quadratic programming (RSQP) methods-based preconditioner can be used for convergence acceleration. The overall cost of computation is reduced up to 70the number of optimization iterations is comparatively large since we update the design parameters in each time-step of state and costate runs. In this paper we use a multigrid strategy to reduce the total number of optimization iterations keeping the idea of the one-shot method. Design examples of drag reduction, together with geometrical constraints, for an RAE2822 airfoil and an SCT wing are included. The total effort required for the convergence of the optimization problem is less than 2 times (4 times) that of the forward simulation runs in two dimensions (in three dimensions).	multigrid method;shadow volume;shape optimization	Subhendu Bikash Hazra	2008	SIAM J.

The grids need not match along the interfaces. We are also interested in the multiscale setting, where the subdomains are partitioned by a mesh of size h, whereas the interfaces are partitioned by a mesh of much coarser size H, and where lower-order polynomials are used in the subdomains and higher-order polynomials are used on the mortar interface mesh. We derive several fully computable a posteriori error estimates which deliver a guaranteed upper bound on the error measured in the energy norm. Our estimates are also locally efficient and one of them is robust with respect to the ratio H/h under an assumption of sufficient regularity of the weak solution. The present approach allows bounding separately and comparing mutually the subdomain and interface errors. A subdomain/interface adaptive refinement strategy is proposed and numerically tested.	computable function;error detection and correction;mortar methods;numerical method;polynomial;refinement (computing)	Gergina Pencheva;Martin Vohralík;Mary F.

In this “Schur Low Rank” (SLR) preconditioning approach, the coefficient matrix is first decoupled by DD, and then a low-rank correction is exploited to compute an approximate inverse of the Schur complement associated with the interface points. The method avoids explicit formation of the Schur complement matrix. We show the feasibility of this strategy for a model problem, and conduct a detailed spectral analysis for the relationship between the low-rank correction and the quality of the preconditioning.

Iterative solution techniques, such as GMRES(k), favor parallel implementations. However, their straightforward parallelization usually leads to a poor parallel performance because of global communication incurred by processors. One variation of GMRES(k) considered here is to adapt the restart value k for any given problem and use Householder reflections in the orthogonalization phase, coupled with graphbased matrix partitioning, to achieve high accuracy and reduce the communication overhead. This particular GMRES implementation is tailored to the uniquely stringent requirements imposed on a linear system solver by probability-one homotopy algorithms: occasionally unusually high accuracy, ability to adapt to problems of widely varying difficulty, and parallelism.	algorithm;central processing unit;degree of parallelism;diffuse reflection;generalized minimal residual method;heuristic (computer science);householder transformation;iterative method;linear system;machine epsilon;mathematical optimization;matrix multiplication;nonlinear system;overhead (computing);parallel computing;reflection (computer graphics);requirement;solver;sparse matrix	Masha Sosonkina;Donald C.

3863a1ad92213326f5eec19b3150a4af192c975c	solving stochastic differential equations and kolmogorov equations by means of deep learning		Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and the Kolmogorov partial differential equations (PDEs) associated to them have been widely used in models from engineering, finance, and the natural sciences. In particular, SDEs and Kolmogorov PDEs, respectively, are highly employed in models for the approximative pricing of financial derivatives. Kolmogorov PDEs and SDEs, respectively, can typically not be solved explicitly and it has been and still is an active topic of research to design and analyze numerical methods which are able to approximately solve Kolmogorov PDEs and SDEs, respectively. Nearly all approximation methods for Kolmogorov PDEs in the literature suffer under the curse of dimensionality or only provide approximations of the solution of the PDE at a single fixed space-time point. In this paper we derive and propose a numerical approximation method which aims to overcome both of the above mentioned drawbacks and intends to deliver a numerical approximation of the Kolmogorov PDE on an entire region [a, b]d without suffering from the curse of dimensionality. Numerical results on examples including the heat equation, the Black-Scholes model, the stochastic Lorenz equation, and the Heston model suggest that the proposed approximation algorithm is quite effective in high dimensions in terms of both accuracy and speed. 1 ar X iv :1 80 6. 00 42 1v 1 [ m at h.

1470c07ac3b1f60f640bb70f8c64b4d7fcc50f69	a high accuracy solver for rte in underwater optical communication path loss prediction		In this paper, we present a new improved numerical framework to evaluate the time-dependent radiative transfer equation (RTE) for underwater optical wireless communication (UOWC) systems. The RTE predicts the optical path-loss of light in an underwater channel, as a function of the inherent optical properties (IOPs) related to the water type, namely the absorption and scattering coefficients as well as the phase scattering function (PSF). We reach the simulation performance based on an improvement of the finite difference scheme proposed in [1] as well as an enhancement of the quadrature method aiming to calculate the integral term of the RTE [2]. Additionally, we evaluate the received power at the receiver plane in three dimensions by considering a given receiver aperture and a field of view (FOV). Finally, we evaluate the UOWC system's bit error rate performance metric as a function of the propagation distance, and time.	algorithm;aperture (software);bit error rate;coefficient;computation;field of view in video games;finite difference method;input impedance;newton;newton–cotes formulas;numerical analysis;optical wireless;simpson's rule;simulation;software propagation;solver	Elmehdi Illi;Faissal El Bouanani;Fouad Ayoub	2018	2018 International Conference on Advanced Communication Technologies and Networking (CommNet)	10.1109/COMMNET.2018.8360253	radiative transfer;bit error rate;optical wireless;path loss;aperture;electronic engineering;scattering;nyström method;communication channel;mathematics	HPC	91.48507681207221	6.808550409822661	86651

The method is based on replacing a point force given by a delta distribution with a smooth localized function and deriving the exact velocity field produced by the forcing. In order to satisfy zero-flow boundary conditions at a solid sphere, the image system for singular Stokeslets is generalized to give exact cancellation of the regularized flow at the surface of the sphere. The regularized image system contains the same elements as the singular counterpart but with coefficients that depend on a regularization parameter. As this parameter vanishes, the expressions reduce to the image system of the singular Stokeslet. The expression relating force and velocity can be inverted to compute the forces that generate a given velocity boundary condition elsewhere in the flow. We present several examples within the context of biological flows at the microscale in order to validate and highlight the usefulness of the image system in computations.	navier–stokes equations	Jacek K.

By using local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) method, the scheme can derive the numerical approximations not only for solutions but also for their gradients at the same time. In addition, the scheme employs the implicit integration factor (IIF) method for temporal discretization, which allows us to take the time-step as (delta t=O(h_{min})), and can be computed element by element, so that it reduces the computational cost greatly. Numerical simulations for the chlorite-iodide-malonic acid (CIMA) model demonstrate the expected behavior of the solutions, the efficiency and advantages of the proposed scheme.	galerkin method;triangulated irregular network	Na An;Xijun Yu;Chaobao Huang;Maochang Duan	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-57099-0_16	discontinuous galerkin method;reaction–diffusion system;mathematical optimization;mathematical model;polygon mesh;mathematics;temporal discretization;iif	HPC	92.64382485663748	10.33675545464357	86673

Unfortunately, such problems are also ill-posed due to lack of continuous dependence of solutions on data. Consequently, numerical methods to solve first-kind Volterra equations are only effective when regularizing features are built into the algorithms or used to control stepsize. Classical methods often combine numerical discretization with Tikhonov regularization, but in doing so the underlying Volterra (or causal) nature of the original problem is often destroyed. Instead, a """" predictor-corrector """" type of numerical method is proposed which combines at each step """" local regularization """" ideas with the use of small intervals of future data. The result is a regularized numerical method which retains much of the causal nature of the Volterra problem and may be solved in fast sequential steps, often improving upon the performance of classical algorithms such as those based on standard Tikhonov regularization.

We select a few problems, where coarse grid correction issues arise because of anisotropic coefficients, non-equidistant or non-uniform grid stretching, or inherent indefiniteness in the partial differential equation. Most of the work in this thesis can be classified as an attempt to increase multigrid efficiency by analysing and developing novel grid coarsening techniques that ensure sufficient coarse grid correction for the multigrid algorithm. Anisotropy in discrete systems can stem from various continuous and discrete features of the problem and has to have its negative effects countered before a successful multigrid solution can be brought about. We select multidimensional stationary diffusion equation as the first important problem to be treated in this context. The work for dimensions higher than three, is aimed at developing grid coarsening strategies for discretization on rectangular hyper-grids that differ greatly in their dimensions, and thus induce the so-called grid-aligned anisotropies in the system. Coarse grids formed through standard coarsening fail to provide sufficient coarse grid correction, and alternative block relaxation techniques are expensive in high dimensions. We also investigate and test coarsening strategies with the aim that their use would allow point based relaxation to stay effective in this non-equidistant multigrid scenario. Through local Fourier analysis we also analyze w-RB Jacobi, and implement a computer program through which we compute the optimal relaxation parameters. There are three important inferences in this regard. (1) Partial (and grid dependent) coarsening strategies allow the successful use of point relaxation methods for this problem. (2) Quadrupling along a few dimensions is a very attractive partial coarsening choice. (3) Optimal relaxation parameters have a significant enhancement effect on multigrid convergence in high dimensions. The efficient solution of time-dependent multidimensional equations (discretized with implicit time-integration schemes) is also a challenge. We first use the sparse grid technique to reduce the exponential complexity of the discrete problem, and then use the d-dimensional multigrid techniques to solve the sparse grid sub problems. In this situation, i.e., with a multitude of different non equidistant grids, evaluating and using optimal relaxation parameters on the fly is not an option any more. As a multigrid solver in high dimensions depends on optimal attributes to quite a large extent, we employ the method as a preconditioner, instead of a solver. This results in a very robust and efficient multigrid preconditioned Bi-CGSTAB solver. Another coarsening strategy that we develop in this thesis is aimed at two-dimensional grids that are non-uniformly stretched. We investigated different experimental coarsening strategies. A strategy based on improving individual mesh aspect ratios of grid cells proves successful both theoretically as well as experimentally. It is based on adaptive coarsening so that on each successive coarsening step the grid cells become more square. We can also successfully use point relaxation methods with the proposed technique and get nice multigrid convergence in this case. This bit of work also has consequence for locally refined grids. Efficient multigrid techniques for the indefinite Helmholtz equation form a separate research theme included in the thesis. We employ the complex shifted operator preconditioning technique for model problems that stem from quantum mechanics applications. These model problems have strongly varying wave-numbers which perturbs the solution. The mesh size requirement in the region of this perturbation is quite demanding. This requirement can be eased by saturating the grid in that area. We find that standard coarsening in this situation works well. This is in contrast to the existing strategies where coarsening is only done in the region of refinement, until the grid is regularized. We discretize the model problems both on equidistant and also on locally refined grids, and the efficiency of the multigrid preconditioner is tested in both these situations. Experiments point to the fact that existing techniques for the indefinite Helmholtz are still not satisfactory and must be enhanced. Some conclusions and outlook mark the end of the thesis.

This iterative method makes use of a preconditioning matrix which is constructed by using a sequence of nested discretizations of the considered elliptic problem. The main computational task in solving problems with this preconditioning matrix is solution of problems, on each fixed level, with matrices which have condition number bounded on hk (— the discretization parameter on the level k). Here we propose to use, in connection with parallel implementation of this multilevel iterative method, domain decomposition technique in order to solve these problems with constantly conditioned matrices. Numerical tests are presented and they are compared with tests in which the solution method is the preconditioned conjugate gradient method with preconditioning matrices derived by approximate (blockwise) factorizations of the constantly conditioned matrices. The last methods suffers of the fact that it is not well parallelizable but it is very fast convergent.	domain decomposition methods;finite element method;preconditioner	Raytcho D. Lazarov;Panayot S.

1980780c456f25262b73587e89db9ed717e5df88	a combined immersed boundary and discrete unified gas kinetic scheme for particle-fluid flows		Abstract A discrete unified gas kinetic scheme (DUGKS) coupled with the immersed boundary (IB) method is developed to perform interface-resolved simulation of particle-laden flows. The present method (IB-DUGKS) preserves the respective advantages of the IB and DUGKS, i.e., the flexibility and efficiency for treating complex flows, and the robustness and low numerical-dissipation. In IB-DUGKS, the IB method is used to treat the fluid-solid interfaces and the DUGKS is applied to simulate the fluid flow, making use of the Lagrangian and Eulerian meshes, respectively. Those two meshes are fully independent, which contributes to the avoidance of grid regeneration when a solid particle moves. Specifically, in the present implementation of IB-DUGKS, the no-slip boundary condition at the particle surface is accurately enforced by introducing an efficient iterative forcing algorithm, and the IB force induced by the particle boundary is conveniently incorporated into the DUGKS with the Strang–Splitting scheme. The accuracy of the IB-DUGKS is first verified in the flows past a stationary cylinder and an oscillating cylinder in a quiescent fluid. After that, several well-established two- and three-dimensional particulate flow problems are simulated, including the sedimentation of a particle and the DKT dynamics of two particles in a channel, and a group of particles settling in an enclosure. In all test cases, the results are in good agreement with the data available in the literature, demonstrating that the proposed IB-DUGKS is a promising tool for simulating particulate flows.	computational fluid dynamics;immersed boundary method	Shi Tao;Haolong Zhang;Zhaoli Guo;Lian-Ping Wang	2018	J.

The algorithm is based on a variant of the conjugate gradient method in combination with the fast Fourier transforms for nonequispaced nodes. The main result is that under mild assumptions the total complexity for solving the interpolation problem at M arbitrary nodes is of order O(M log M). This result is obtained by the use of localised trigonometric kernels where the localisation is chosen in accordance to the spatial dimension d.

The theoretical formulation as well as numerical implementation are presented such as to meet the following requirements: simplicity, reliability and practical applicability to make the resulting software product available for a direct use on the construction site. To that end a recently introduced 2D3D modeling of tunnel excavation incorporating the in situ measurements is effectively combined with a fully three-dimensional (3D) beam-like representation of a typical urban structure made of masonry or precast concrete.

ec398816ee8f33e96948c63f03503b4b32506c06	multilayer shallow water models with locally variable number of layers and semi-implicit time discretization		Abstract We propose an extension of the discretization approaches for multilayer shallow water models, aimed at making them more flexible and efficient for realistic applications to coastal flows. A novel discretization approach is proposed, in which the number of vertical layers and their distribution are allowed to change in different regions of the computational domain. Furthermore, semi-implicit schemes are employed for the time discretization, leading to a significant efficiency improvement for subcritical regimes. We show that, in the typical regimes in which the application of multilayer shallow water models is justified, the resulting discretization does not introduce any major spurious feature and allows again to reduce substantially the computational cost in areas with complex bathymetry. As an example of the potential of the proposed technique, an application to a sediment transport problem is presented, showing a remarkable improvement with respect to standard discretization approaches.	discretization;semiconductor industry	Luca Bonaventura;Enrique Domingo Fernández-Nieto;J.

The fine scale is given by the meshsize h whereas the coarse scale is dictated by an integrodifferential approximation of the PDE. We show that the FEM satisfies the discrete maximum principle (DMP) for any uniformly positive definite matrix A(x) provided that the mesh is weakly acute. Combining the DMP with weak operator consistency of the FEM, we establish convergence of the numerical solution u h to the viscosity solution u as , h→ 0 and ≥ Ch| lnh|. We develop a discrete Alexandroff-Bakelman-Pucci (ABP) estimate which is suitable for finite element analysis. Its proof relies on a geometric interpretation of Alexandroff estimate and control of the measure of the sub-differential of piecewise linear functions in terms of jumps, and thus of the discrete PDE. The discrete ABP estimate leads, under suitable regularity assumptions on A and u, to the estimate ‖u− u h ‖L∞(Ω) ≤ C ( h ∣∣ lnh∣∣)α/(2+α) 0 < α ≤ 2, provided ≈ (h2| lnh|)1/(2+α). Such a convergence rate is at best of order h ∣∣ lnh∣∣1/2, which turns out to be quasi-optimal.	alternating bit protocol;approximation;finite element method;linear function;numerical partial differential equations;piecewise linear continuation;rate of convergence;viscosity solution	Ricardo H.

Regarding constitutive effects, elasticity and shear hardening with a nonassociative flow rule are included. The paper shows that flutter illposedness is an essential feature of many such constitutive models. In the paper, a readily applicable criterion for the occurrence of flutter illposedness is developed. When parameters characterizing the material reach this criterion, the governing PDEs exhibit flutter illposedness over a range of values of the hardening modulus. Asymptotic estimates for this range are given. In some cases, flutter illposedness is derived by a perturbation argument (perturbing the constitutive law, not the solution). The paper demonstrates this material with a deviatorically associative flow rule at small strains; although flutter illposedness does not occur, a generic small perturbation will cause flutter illposedness.

This magnetic Schrödinger operator exhibits a magnetic barrier at x = 0. The unperturbed system is invariant with respect to translations in the ydirection. As a result, the Schrödinger operator admits a direct integral decomposition. We analyze the band functions of the fiber operators as functions of the wave number and establish their asymptotic behavior. Because the fiber operators are reflection symmetric, the band functions may be classified as odd or even. The odd band functions have a unique absolute minimum. We calculate the effective mass at the minimum and prove that it is positive. The even band functions are monotone decreasing. We prove that the eigenvalues of an Airy operator, respectively, harmonic oscillator operator, describe the asymptotic behavior of the band functions for large negative, respectively positive, wave numbers. We prove a Mourre estimate for perturbations of the magnetic Schrödinger operator and establish the existence of absolutely continuous spectrum in certain energy intervals. We prove lower bounds on magnetic edge currents for states with energies in the same intervals. We also prove that these lower bounds imply stable lower bounds for the asymptotic currents. We study the perturbation by slowly decaying negative potentials and establish the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalue counting function for the infinitely-many eigenvalues below the bottom of the essential spectrum.	hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);perturbation theory;schrödinger;monotone	Nicolas Dombrowski;Peter D.

It addresses the nonsingularity of the interpolation equations, the inclusion of polynomial terms, and the accuracy of the approximation sf, where s is the interpolant. Then some numerical experiments investigate the situation when the data points are on a low dimensional nonlinear manifold in R d. They suggest that the number of data points that are necessary for good accuracy on the manifold is independent of d, even if d is very large. The experiments employ linear and multiquadric radial functions, because an iterative algorithm for these cases was developed at Cambridge recently. The algorithm is described brieey. Fortunately, the number of iterations is small when the data points are on a low dimensional manifold. We expect these ndings to be useful, because the manifold setting for large d is similar to typical distributions of interpolation points in data mining applications.	algorithm;approximation;data mining;data point;experiment;interpolation;iteration;iterative method;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;polynomial;radial (radio);radial basis function	M.

Our work is aimed at giving a new reproducing kernel method for multi-point BVPs. We do not put the homogenization conditions into the reproducing kernel space which can avoid to compute the reproducing kernel satisfying boundary conditions and the orthogonal system. Three numerical examples are studied to demonstrate the accuracy of the present method. Results obtained by our method indicate that new algorithm has the following advantages: small computational work, fast convergence speed and high precision. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.	algorithm;amiga software;boundary case;computation;entity–relationship model;hilbert space;kernel method;local interconnect network;multipoint ground;nonlocal lagrangian;numerical analysis;numerical method;user space;word lists by frequency;yao graph	Zhiyuan Li;Yulan Wang;Fugui Tan;Xiao-Hui Wan;Hao Yu;Jun-Sheng Duan	2015	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2015.05.117	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;calculus;mathematics;representer theorem	AI	83.961105798629	17.101566293827	88054

We implement a local orthogonal transform to transform the irregular waveguide in physical plane into a regular rectangle in computing plane. Then the modified Helmholtz system in computational domain is piecewise solved through a second order numerical marching scheme, and we propose a spectral projector based on the truncated local propagating eigenfunction expansion to regularize the marching scheme. In the end, the marching scheme is verified by extensive numerical experiments, and it is shown that the scheme is efficient, stable and accurate in rapidly varying waveguides with curved boundaries, even when the number of propagating modes in the main propagation direction is variable.

This work was motivated by the need to compute cost function gradients for dynamically constrained optimization for robustness, i.e. the problem of finding the model parameters of a given dynamical system that lead to minimum solution sensitivity. The proposed approach for this particular second-order sensi-tivity problem falls into the class of the so-called 'adjoint-over-forward' methods and is based on solving the continuous forward sensitivity equations (for evaluating the cost functional) and their continuous adjoint systems (for evaluation of the gradient of the cost functional). Efficiency is ensured by: (i) a suitable distribution over processors of the individual sensitivity systems, both forward and adjoint so that inter-process communication is minimized; and (ii) use of an iterative solver combined with a block-diagonal preconditioner for the solution of the linear systems arising in the implicit integration of the resulting ordinary differential equations (ODE) systems. The proposed algorithm was implemented as an extension of the cvodes solver in sundials [P. Brown, K. Grant, A. Hindmarsh, S. Lee, R.S.D. Shumaker, and C. Woodward. SUNDIALS: SUite of Nonlinear and DIfferential/ALgebraic equation Solvers, ACM Trans. Math. Software, 31(3) (2005), pp. 363-396], but it can be used in conjunction with any sensitivity-enabled ODE integrator that provides adjoint sensitivity capabilities and (if based on implicit integration methods) support for iterative linear algebra.	computational model;mathematical optimization	Radu Serban	2009	Optimization Methods and Software	10.1080/10556780802394217	ordinary differential equation;mathematical optimization;constrained optimization;discrete mathematics;differential algebraic equation;theoretical computer science;linear algebra;dynamical system;mathematics;functional dependency;linear system;sensitivity analysis;second-order logic;distributed computing environment;inter-process communication	Vision	87.06590285511824	21.441387381392452	88154

A node-based discretization of the numerical fluxes is obtained through the computation of the time rate of change of the cell volume. It allows to derive finite volume numerical schemes that are compatible with the geometric conservation law (GCL). Two discretizations of the momentum equations are proposed depending on the form of the discrete gradient operator. The first one corresponds to the control volume scheme while the second one corresponds to the so-called area weighted scheme. Both formulations share the same discretization for the total energy equation. In both schemes, fluxes are computed using the same nodal solver which can be viewed as a two-dimensional extension of an approximate Riemann solver. The control volume scheme is conservative for momentum, total energy and satisfies a local entropy inequality in its first-order semi-discrete form. However, it does not preserve spherical symmetry. On the other hand, the area weighted scheme is conservative for total energy and preserves spherical symmetry for one-dimensional spherical flow on equiangular polar grid. The two-dimensional high-order extensions of these two schemes are constructed employing the generalized Riemann problem (GRP) in the acoustic approximation. Many numerical tests are presented in order to assess these new schemes. The results obtained for various representative configurations of one and two-dimensional compressible fluid flows show the robustness and the accuracy of our new schemes.	acoustic cryptanalysis;approximation algorithm;augmented lagrangian method;computation;discretization;finite volume method;first-order predicate;first-order reduction;formal system;gnu common lisp;gentoo linux;gradient;lagrangian (field theory);navier–stokes equations;numerical analysis;riemann problem;riemann solver;semiconductor industry;social inequality;velocity (software development)	Pierre-Henri Maire	2009	J.

These new methods include the Halley method and its variant forms as special cases. Various numerical examples are given to illustrate the efficiency and performance of the new methods. These new iterative methods may be viewed as an addition and generalization of the existing methods for solving nonlinear equations. It is well known that a wide class of problems, which arises in diverse disciplines of mathematical and engineering science can be studied by the nonlinear equation of the form f ðxÞ ¼ 0. Numerical methods for finding the approximate solutions of the nonlinear equation are being developed by using several different techniques including Taylor series, quadrature formulas, homotopy and decomposition techniques, see [1–17] and the references therein. In this paper, we use alternative decomposition technique to suggest the main iterative schemes which generates the iterative methods of higher order. First of all, we rewrite the given nonlinear equation along with the auxiliary function as an equivalent coupled system of equations using the Taylor series. This approach enables us to express the given nonlinear equation as sum of linear and nonlinear equations. This way of writing the given equation is known as the decomposition and plays the central role in suggesting the iterative methods for solving nonlinear equations f ðxÞ ¼ 0. In this work, we use the system of coupled equations to express the given nonlinear equations as a sum of linear and non-linear operators involving the auxiliary function gðxÞ. This auxiliary function helps to deduce several iterative methods for solving nonlinear equations. The effectiveness and efficiency of the auxiliary function can be observed in the next section for deriving the robust iterative methods for solving nonlinear equations. Results obtained in this paper, suggest that this new technique of decomposition is a promising tool. In section 2, we sketch out the main ideas of this technique and suggest some multi-step iterative methods for solving nonlinear equations. One can notice that if the derivative of the function vanishes, that is f 0 ðx n Þ ¼ 0, during the iterative process, then the sequence generated by the …	approximation algorithm;halley's method;iterative method;newton's method;newton–cotes formulas;nonlinear system;numerical method;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations;rewrite (programming)	Farooq Ahmed Shah;Muhammad Aslam Noor	2015	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2014.11.065	local convergence;l-stability;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;stone method;auxiliary function;simultaneous equations;convergence;calculus;mathematics;iterative method;newton's method;matrix-free methods;relaxation;numerical partial differential equations;multigrid method;algebra	EDA	83.23331443848419	16.49073590588375	88311

The method, which we name Surface Lagrangian Remeshing (SLR), is adapted to 2D Lagrangian models which couple surface erosion with deformation of Earth materials. The remeshing procedure preserves nodes defining the surface submitted to erosion and removes nodes belonging to surface elements whose internal angles or area is critically low. This algorithm is ideally suited to track long term surface evolution. To validate the method we perform a set of numerical tests, using triangular finite elements, which compare the results obtained with the SLR algorithm with global remeshing and with analytical results. The results show good agreements with analytical solutions. Interpolation errors associated with remeshing are generated locally and numerical diffusion is restricted to the remeshed domain itself. In addition this method is computationally costless compared to classical global remeshing algorithm. We propose to couple the SLR method with the Dynamical Lagrangian Remeshing (DLR) algorithm to enable local remeshing only of Lagrangian models coupling large deformation of Earth materials with large erosion. & 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

0891b53252ca05bc78f1aaf12943b7f93f0dad39	fast directional multilevel summation for oscillatory kernels based on chebyshev interpolation	chebyshev interpolation;fast multilevel summation;oscillatory kernel	Many applications lead to large systems of linear equations with dense matrices. Direct matrix-vector products become prohibitive, since the computational cost increases quadratically with the size of the problem. By exploiting specific kernel properties fast algorithms can be constructed. A directional multilevel algorithm for translation-invariant oscillatory kernels of the type K(x,y)=G(x-y)e^i^k^|^x^-^y^|, with G(x-y) being any smooth kernel, will be presented. We will first present a general approach to build fast multipole methods (FMMs) based on Chebyshev interpolation and the adaptive cross approximation (ACA) for smooth kernels. The Chebyshev interpolation is used to transfer information up and down the levels of the FMM. The scheme is further accelerated by compressing the information stored at Chebyshev interpolation points using ACA and QR decompositions. This leads to a nearly optimal computational cost with a small pre-processing time due to the low computational cost of ACA. This approach is in particular faster than performing singular value decompositions. This does not address the difficulties associated with the oscillatory nature of K. For that purpose, we consider the following modification of the kernel K^u=K(x,y)e^-^i^k^u^.^(^x^-^y^), where u is a unit vector (see Brandt [1]). We proved that the kernel K^u can be interpolated efficiently when x-y lies in a cone of direction u. This result is used to construct an FMM for the kernel K. Theoretical error bounds will be presented to control the error in the computation as well as the computational cost of the method. The paper ends with the presentation of 2D and 3D numerical convergence studies, and computational cost benchmarks.	chebyshev nodes;chebyshev polynomials;ewald summation;interpolation	Matthias Messner;Martin Schanz;Eric F Darve	2012	J.

Although, numerical treatment of Singular integral equations (SIEs) has been considered by many researchers and many numerical methods have been proposed for the solution of this equation, strong singularity of the Cauchy singular integral operator still remains as a challenge to numerical methods. Most of the previous methods relay on specific quadrature rule or suitable base functions for capture the singularity. Here we focus on operator transformation and graded mesh. In addition, we study error analysis. In this regard, efficiency of reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) method using smooth transformation on the graded mesh is improved and compared with some other numerical methods.	error analysis (mathematics);hilbert space;kernel (operating system);numerical method;relay;technological singularity	Hossein Beyrami;Taher Lotfi;Katayoun Mahdiani	2016	J.

The method uses a finite element solution of the flow with a unit cell within the self-replicating lattice for planar extensional flow identified by Kraynik and Reinelt [A.M. Kraynik, D.A. Reinelt, Extensional motions of spatially periodic lattices, Int. J. Multiphase Flow 18 (1992) 1045]. This is implemented using a quotient space representation that maps all points space onto points within the unit cell. This mapping is preserved by using fully Lagrangian grid movement, with grid quality preserved by a combination of Delaunay reconnection and grid adaptivity. The no-slip boundary conditions on the particles are enforced weakly via a traction force acting as a Lagrange multiplier. The method allows simulations of suspensions under planar extensional flow to be conducted to large strains in a truly periodic cell. The method is illustrated for both isotropic and anisotropic two-dimensional particles and can be easily extended to viscoelastic fluids and to non-rigid particles.	finite element method;simulation	Malidi Ahamadi;Oliver Harlen	2008	J.

The physical domain is embedded into a larger, rectangular domain, and the equations of motion are solved on this extended domain. The boundary conditions are enforced by applying forces near the embedded boundaries. This raises the question of how the flow outside the physical domain influences the flow inside the physical domain. This question is particularly relevant when using a projection method for incompressible flow. In this paper, analysis and computational tests are presented that explore the performance of projection methods when used with direct forcing methods. Sufficient conditions for the success of projection methods on extended domains are derived, and it is shown how forcing methods meet these conditions. Bounds on the error due to projecting on the extended domain are derived, and it is shown that direct forcing methods are, in general, first-order accurate in the max-norm. Numerical tests of the projection alone confirm the analysis and show that this error is concentrated near the embedded boundaries, leading to higher-order accuracy in integral norms. Generically, forcing methods generate a solution that is not smooth across the embedded boundaries, and it is this lack of smoothness which limits the accuracy of the methods. Additional computational tests of the Navier-Stokes equations involving a direct forcing method and a projection method are presented, and the results are compared with the predictions of the analysis. These results confirm that the lack of smoothness in the solution produces a lower-order error. The rate of convergence attained in practice depends on the type of forcing method used.	computation;embedded system;first-order predicate;immersed boundary method;navier–stokes equations;numerical method;order of accuracy;projection method (fluid dynamics);rate of convergence	Robert D.

In contrast to traditional FEM, it overcomes the restrictions of conforming basis functions by allowing for discontinuous elements with weakly enforced continuity constraints. This added flexibility enables the simulation of arbitrarily shaped, convex and non-convex polyhedral elements, while still using simple polynomial basis functions. For the accurate strain integration over these elements we propose an analytic technique based on the divergence theorem. Being able to handle arbitrary elements eventually allows us to derive simple and efficient techniques for volumetric mesh generation, adaptive mesh refinement, and robust cutting.	adaptive mesh refinement;basis function;convex function;discontinuous galerkin method;finite element method;mesh generation;polyhedron;polynomial basis;refinement (computing);scott continuity;simulation	Peter Kaufmann;Sebastian Martin;Mario Botsch;Markus H.

This approach produces results that are second-order accurate and robust to the perturbation of the interface location on the grid. Moreover, since we use a cell-wise approach, this procedure can be easily extended to quadtree and octree grids. We demonstrate the second-order accuracy and the robustness of the method in two and three spatial dimensions. 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The method also determines normal vectors and principal directions. Compared to explicit methods, the implicit approach shows robustness and improved accuracy to measure curvatures of implicit surfaces. This is evaluated on simple cases where curvature is known in closed-form. The method is applied to compute the curvatures of wrinkled flames on large triangular unstructured meshes (namely a 3D isosurface of temperature).	computation;explicit and implicit methods;implicit surface;isosurface;scalar processor;unstructured grid	Eric Albin;Ronnie Knikker;Shihe Xin;Christian Oliver Paschereit;Yves D'Angelo	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-67885-6_1	scalar (physics);isosurface;scalar field;robustness (computer science);curvature;polygon mesh;gaussian;principal curvature;mathematical analysis;mathematics	Visualization	92.79015644169093	10.616756996506307	90068

This change of variables is accomplished in the differentiate–then–discretize approach by constructing the descent directions in a control space not equipped with the Hilbert structure. We show how such descent directions can be computed in general Lebesgue and Besov spaces, and argue that in the Besov space case determination of descent directions can be interpreted as nonlinear wavelet filtering of the adjoint field. The freedom involved in choosing parameters characterizing the spaces in which the steepest descent directions are constructed can be leveraged to accelerate convergence of iterations. Our computational examples involving state estimation problems for the 1D Kuramoto–Sivashinsky and 3D Navier–Stokes equations indeed show significantly improved performance of the proposed method as compared to the standard approaches.	discretization;gradient descent;iteration;kuramoto model;mathematical optimization;navier–stokes equations;nonlinear system;wavelet	Bartosz Protas	2008	J.

This scheme uses firstly both cell-centered unknowns and vertex unknowns, and then the vertex unknowns are treated as a linear combination of the surrounding cell-centered unknowns, which reduces the scheme to a cell-centered one. The weights in the linear combination are derived through the linearity preserving approach and can be obtained by solving a local linear system whose solvability is rigorously discussed. Moreover, the relations between our linearity preserving scheme and some existing schemes are also discussed, by which a generalized multipoint flux approximation scheme based on the linearity preserving criterion is suggested. Numerical experiments show that the linearity preserving schemes in this paper have nearly second order accuracy on many highly skewed and highly distorted structured quadrilateral meshes. 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We aim to use the dynamics of such a problem to describe the spreading of a new or invasive species, with the free boundary representing the expanding front. We prove a spreadingvanishing dichotomy for this model, namely the species either successfully spreads to all the new environment and stabilizes at a positive equilibrium state, or it fails to establish and dies out in the long run. Sharp criteria for spreading and vanishing are given. Moreover, we show that when spreading occurs, for large time, the expanding front moves at a constant speed. This spreading speed is uniquely determined by an elliptic problem induced from the original model.	logistic regression	Yihong Du;Zhigui Lin	2013	SIAM J. Math.

Our scaling corresponds to a weakly nonlinear regime where the nonlinearity affects the leading order amplitude of the solution without altering the rapid oscillations. We show the validity of the WKB-analysis when the potential in the nonlinearity is singular around the origin. No new resonant wave is created in our model, this phenomenon is inhibited due to the nonlinearity. The nonlocal nature of this latter leads us to build our result on a high-frequency averaging effects. In the proof we make use of the Wiener algebra and the space of square-integrable functions.	semiconductor industry	Lounès Mouzaoui	2013	Asymptotic Analysis	10.3233/ASY-131175	asymptotic analysis;mathematical analysis;scaling;mathematics;wiener algebra;amplitude;nonlinear system;hartree;hartree equation;phenomenon	Vision	84.70872442733447	5.153106582786906	90533

The suggested method has been tested on a simple grid structure and also on a large building model, where the accuracy and efficiency of the introduced approach have been quantified.	structural analysis	H.

d5d60b8c540db69b22ce4b195eb3aefbb5548c8e	solving nonlinear circuits with pulsed excitation by multirate partial differential equations		In this paper, the concept of multirate partial differential equations (MPDEs) is applied to obtain an efficient solution for nonlinear low-frequency electrical circuits with pulsed excitation. The MPDEs are solved by a Galerkin approach and a conventional time discretization. Nonlinearities are efficiently accounted for by neglecting the high-frequency components (ripples) of the state variables and using only their envelope for the evaluation. It is shown that the impact of this approximation on the solution becomes increasingly negligible for rising frequency and leads to significant performance gains.	approximation;discretization;galerkin method;nonlinear system;ripple effect;speedup	Andreas Pels;Johan J.

48156d7dd5c373d4b8dc8b4863b6818230a9968f	fourier pseudospectral method on generalized sparse grids for the space-fractional schrödinger equation		Abstract In this paper, the time-splitting Fourier pseudospectral method on the generalized sparse grids is applied to solve the space-fractional Schrodinger equation. We give a containment relation between different level-index sets of the generalized sparse grids, and it can be used in designing the reference generalized sparse grids which are finer than other considered grids. Thus the numerical solution on the reference generalized sparse grids can be used as the reference true solution of the equation. Then, the fully discrete algorithm is obtained. In the numerical experiments, we compare the numerical results on the generalized sparse grids with those on the full grids. For the interpolation of the Gaussian multiplied by a factor and for the computation of the Schrodinger equation with two kinds of non-smooth potentials, the advantages of the Fourier pseudospectral method on the generalized sparse grids with the level-index set of parameter K = 1 , 2 , 3 are manifest in the approximation with high resolution. Here the sparsity of the generalized sparse grids will become weak when the parameter K becomes large. Moreover, the advantage of the generalized sparse grids is more pronounced in solving the Schrodinger equation with the higher dimension, the square well potential or the fractional Laplacian.	fractional schrödinger equation;pseudo-spectral method;sparse grid;sparse matrix	Yunqing Huang;Xueyang Li;Aiguo Xiao	2018	Computers & Mathematics with Applications	10.1016/j.camwa.2018.03.026	mathematical optimization;interpolation;mathematical analysis;fourier transform;mathematics;pseudo-spectral method;sparse grid;schrödinger equation;computation;finite potential well;gaussian	HPC	85.53362335826668	20.003738975594107	90850

The viscous dissipation occurring in the pores is described using the dynamic permeability model developed by Johnson-Koplik-Dashen (JKD). Some of the coefficients in the Biot-JKD model are proportional to the square root of the frequency. In the time-domain, these coefficients introduce shifted fractional derivatives of order 1/2, involving a convolution product. Based on a diffusive representation, the convolution kernel is replaced by a finite number of memory variables that satisfy local-in-time ordinary differential equations, resulting in the Biot-DA (diffusive approximation) model. The properties of both the Biot-JKD and the Biot-DA model are analyzed: hyperbolicity, decrease of energy, dispersion. To determine the coefficients of the diffusive approximation, two approaches are analyzed: Gaussian quadratures and optimization methods in the frequency range of interest. The nonlinear optimization is shown to be the better way of determination. A splitting strategy is then applied to approximate numerically the Biot-DA equations. The propagative part is discretized using a fourth-order ADER scheme on a Cartesian grid, whereas the diffusive part is solved exactly. An immersed interface method is implemented to take into account heterogeneous media on a Cartesian grid and to discretize the jump conditions at interfaces. Numerical experiments are presented. Comparisons with analytical solutions show the efficiency and the accuracy of the approach, and some numerical experiments are performed to investigate wave phenomena in complex media, such as multiple scattering across a set of random scatterers.	approximation algorithm;biot–tolstoy–medwin diffraction model;cartesian closed category;coefficient;convolution;discretization;experiment;frequency band;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method;regular grid;simulation	Emilie Blanc;Guillaume Chiavassa;Bruno Lombard	2014	J.

Insertion technique and collapsing technique are proposed to modify the mesh topology and improve the quality of the degenerated elements which are on the mesh boundaries and cannot be improved by any nodes position smoothing methods. A curvature-based Laplacian smoothing method is employed to improve the shape-quality of boundary elements and ensure that the boundary characters of mesh are well preserved. A method for improving the shape-quality of the mesh surface and the initial elements which is based on the objective function of the mesh quality metric is proposed. For the mesh surface, the Condition Number of the Jacobian metric associated with the quadrangle elements is taken as the optimization objective function. For the initial elements, after smoothing with the Laplacian method, the Scaled Jacobian metric associated with the hexahedral elements is employed as the optimization objective function. The proposed optimization methods have been applied to the adaptive generation of the hexahedral element mesh using grid-based method. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed optimization methods are tested through several complex three-dimensional models.	algorithm;condition number;hexahedron;jacobian matrix and determinant;laplacian smoothing;loss function;mathematical optimization;mesh networking;optimization problem;quadrangle (geography);solid modeling	Hongmei Zhang;Guoqun Zhao	2010	Computer Aided Geometric Design	10.1016/j.cagd.2010.05.003	mathematical optimization;quality management;boundary element method;computer aided design;mathematics;geometry;laplacian smoothing	ML	96.71284140348905	13.806479144886172	91098

The key features of this HR are that the reconstruction on each control volume only uses adjacent control volumes, which forms a compact stencil set, and there is no truncation of higher degree terms of the polynomial. We explore a WENO-type linear reconstruction on each hierarchical level for the reconstruction of high degree polynomials. Numerical computations for scalar and system of nonlinear hyperbolic equations are performed. We demonstrate that the hierarchical reconstruction can generate essentially non-oscillatory solutions while keeping the resolution and desired order of accuracy for smooth solutions.	compact stencil;computation;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;order of accuracy;polynomial;truncation;unstructured grid	Zhiliang Xu;Yingjie Liu;Chi-Wang Shu	2009	J.

The key idea is to represent both the exact and the numerical solution by the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators that they induce on the coupling hypersurface in the exterior of an obstacle. The investigation of convergence can then be related to a spectral analysis of these DtN operators. We give a general outline of our method and then proceed to a detailed investigation of the case that the coupling surface is a sphere. Our main goal is to explore the convergence mechanism. In this context, we show well-posedness of both the continuous and the discrete models. We further show that the discrete inf-sup constants have a positive lower bound that does not depend on the number of DOF of the IEM. The proofs are based on lemmas on the spectra of the continuous and the discrete DtN operators, where the spectral characterization of the discrete DtN operator is given as a conjecture from numerical experiments. In our convergence analysis, we show algebraic (in terms of N) convergence of arbitrary order and generalize this result to exponential convergence.		Leszek F.

Given a bounded autonomous vector field b : R2 → R2, we study the uniqueness of bounded solutions to the initial value problem for the related transport equation ∂tu + b · ∇u = 0. Assuming that b is of class BV and it is nearly incompressible, we prove uniqueness of weak solutions to the transport equation. The present work extends the result obtained in [S. Bianchini and N. A. Gusev, Steady nearly incompressible vector fields in 2D: Chain rule and Renormalization, preprint, 2014], where the steady nearly incompressible case is treated. Our proof is based on splitting the equation onto a suitable partition of the plane: this technique was introduced in [G. Alberti, S. Bianchini, and G. Crippa, J. Eur. Math. Soc.

Sci.(s), 12 (2013), pp. 863–902]. Furthermore, in order to construct the partition, we use Ambrosio’s superposition principle [L. Ambrosio, Invent.

fde06a26ed8e6660f8adf85050e8103e51049802	cubit and seismic wave propagation based upon the spectral-element method: an advanced unstructured mesher for complex 3d geological media		Unstructured hexahedral mesh generation is a critical part of the modeling process in the Spectral-Element Method (SEM). We present some examples of seismic wave propagation in complex geological models, automatically meshed on a parallel machine based upon CUBIT (Sandia Laboratory, cubit.sandia.gov), an advanced 3D unstructured hexahedral mesh generator that offers new opportunities for seismologist to design, assess, and improve the quality of a mesh in terms of both geometrical and numerical accuracy. The main goal is to provide useful tools for understanding seismic phenomena due to surface topography and subsurface structures such as low wave-speed sedimentary basins. Our examples cover several typical geophysical problems: 1) “layer-cake” volumes with high-resolution topography and complex solidsolid interfaces (such as the Campi Flegrei Caldera Area in Italy), and 2) models with an embedded sedimentary basin (such as the Taipei basin in Taiwan or the Grenoble Valley in France). Emanuele Casarotti, Marco Stupazzini, Shiann Jong Lee, Dimitri Komatitsch, Antonio Piersanti, and Jeroen Tromp 580 Emanuele Casarotti et al. 1 The spectral-element method in seismology Wave propagation phenomena can nowadays be studied thanks to many powerful numerical techniques. We have seen rapid advances in computational seismology at global, regional, and local scales thanks to various numerical schemes, such as the finite-difference method (FDM) [15], the finite-element method (FEM) [1], the spectral-element method (SEM) [12], the integral boundary-element method (IBEM) [2], and the Arbitrary High-Order Discontinuous Galerkin method (ADER-DG) [8]. Spurred by the computational power made available by parallel computers, geoscientists and engineers can now accurately compute synthetic seismograms in realistic 3D Earth models. Among the methods previously listed, the SEM has convincingly demonstrated the ability to handle high-resolution simulations of seismic wave propagation in 3D domains. The purpose of this article is not to give a complete description of the SEM, but a basic introduction to the main properties of the SEM is needed in order to understand the various constraints imposed on the meshing process. The SEM is as a generalization of the FEM based on the use of high-order piecewise polynomial functions. A crucial aspect of the method is its capability to provide an arbitrary increase in accuracy by simply increasing the algebraic degree of these functions (the spectral degree n). From a practical perspective, this operation is completely transparent to the users, who limit themselves to choosing the spectral degree at runtime, leaving to the software the task of building up suitable quadrature points and the relevant degrees of freedom. Obviously, one can also use mesh refinement to improve the accuracy of the numerical solution, thus following the traditional finite-element approach. Referring to the literature for further details [12], we begin by briefly summarizing the key features of the SEM. We start from the general differential form of the equation of elastodynamics: ρ∂ t s = ∇ · T + F, (1) where s(x, t) denotes the displacement at position x and time t, ρ(x) is the density distribution, and F(x, t) the external body force. The stress tensor T is related to the strain tensor by the constitutive relation T = c : ∇s, where c denotes a fourth-order tensor. No particular assumptions are made regarding the structure of c, which describes the (an)elastic properties of the medium (the formulation is general and can incorporate full anisotropy [9] or non-linear constitutive relationships [6]). For seismological applications, a numerical technique needs to facilitate at least the following: (i) an attenuating medium, (ii) absorption of seismic energy on the fictitious boundaries of the domain in order to mimic a semiinfinite medium (the free-surface condition is a natural condition in the SEM), and finally (iii) seismic sources. In the SEM all these features are readily accommodated [12]. 5B.4 CUBIT and Seismic Wave Propagation 581 As in the FEM, the dynamic equilibrium problem for the medium can be written in a weak, or variational, form, and, through a suitable discretization procedure that depends on the numerical approach, can be cast as a system of ordinary differential equations with respect to time. Time-marching of this system of equations may be accomplished based upon an explicit second-order finite-difference scheme, which is conditionally stable and must satisfy the well known Courant condition [4]. The key features of the SEM discretization are as follows: 1. Like in the FEM, the model volume Ω is subdivided into a number of non-overlapping elements Ωe, e = 1, . . . , ne, such that Ω = ⋃ne e=1 Ωe. 2. The expansion of any function within the elements is accomplished based upon Lagrange polynomials of suitable degree n constructed from n + 1 interpolation nodes. 3. In each element, the interpolation nodes are chosen to be the GaussLobatto-Legendre (GLL) points, i.e., the n+1 roots of the first derivatives of the Legendre polynomial of degree n. On such nodes, the displacement, its spatial derivatives, and integrals encountered in the weak formulation are evaluated. 4. The spatial integration is performed based upon GLL quadrature (while most classical FEMs use Gauss quadrature). Thanks to this numerical strategy, exponential accuracy of the method is ensured and the computational effort minimized, because the resulting mass matrix is exactly diagonal. The latter feature does not occur in so-called hp FEMs, nor in SEMs based upon Chebychev polynomials. 2 Mesh design for Spectral-Element Methods The first critical ingredient required for a spectral-element simulation is a high-quality mesh appropriate for the 3D model of interest. This process generally requires discouraging expertise in meshing and preprocessing, and is subject to several tough constraints: 1) the number of grid points per shortest desired wavelength, 2) the numerical stability condition, 3) an acceptable distortion of the elements, 4) balancing of numerical cost and available computing resources. A poor-quality mesh can generate numerical problems that lead to an increase in the computational cost, poor (or lack of) convergence of the simulation, or inaccurate results. For example, a geological model often includes a layered volume, and a staircase sampling of the interfaces between the layers can produce fictitious diffractions. Therefore, a good mesh should honor at least the major geological discontinuities of the model. As noted in Section 1, the SEM is similar to a high-degree FEM, and in fact these methods share the first part of the discretization process. The present paper is focused on this first meshing step, and thus the results are relevant to both FEMs and SEMs. In the SEM, the subsequent step is the 582 Emanuele Casarotti et al. evaluation of the model on the GLL integration points [12]. Here we only note that if we use Lagrange polynomials and GLL quadrature, the mass matrix is exactly diagonal, resulting in a dramatic improvement in numerical accuracy and efficiency. With this choice, each element of the mesh contains (n + 1) GLL points. Unfortunately, this approach requires that the mesh elements are hexahedra [12]. It is worth mentioning that for 2D problems it is possible to develop a SEM with triangles keeping the diagonal mass matrix but with an higher numerical cost [10]. The fact that we are restricted to hexahedral elements complicates matters significantly. Whereas 3D unstructured tetrahedral meshes can be constructed relatively easily with commercial or non-commercial codes, the creation of 3D unstructured hexahedral meshes remains a challenging and unresolved problem. For complex models, as in the case of realistic geological volumes, generating an all-hexahedral mesh based upon the available meshing algorithms can require weeks or months, even for an expert user [21]. One of the features of the SEM that impacts the creation of the mesh is the polynomial degree n used to discretize the wave field. The following heuristic rule has emerged to select n for an unstructured mesh of a heterogeneous medium: if n < 4 the inaccuracies are similar to the standard FEM, while if n > 10 the accuracy improves but the numerical cost of the simulation becomes prohibitive. The choice of n is related to the grid spacing Δh: in order to resolve the wave field to a shortest period T0, the number of points per wavelength λ should be equal or greater than 5, leading to the constraint expressed in Eq. 2. If n = 4, then Δh is roughly equal to λ. We note that, for the same accuracy, a classical low-degree FEM requires a higher number of elements. Since the material properties are stored for each GLL point and can vary inside an element, we are able to interpolate the geological interfaces that our mesh is not able to follow. Nevertheless, this is an undesirable staircase sampling of the model, which introduces non-physical diffractions. Therefore, it is necessary that the mesh honors the major seismological contrasts. Furthermore, when a discontinuity is honored, the elements across the interface share some nodes, which will have the properties of the material below the discontinuity in one case, and the proprieties of the material above the discontinuity in the other case. Thus, the actual behavior of the seismic waves at the geological interface is perfectly mimicked in a way that cannot be achieved by an interpolation solely based upon Lagrange polynomials and the GLL quadrature. Another constraint on the design of the mesh is the stability condition imposed by the adoption of an explicit conditionally stable time scheme. For a given mesh, there is an upper limit on the time step above which the calculations are unstable. We define the Courant stability number of the time scheme as C = Δt(v/Δh)max, where Δt is the time step and (v/	3d modeling;adaptive mesh refinement;algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;boundary element method;c date and time functions;cubit;calculus of variations;clenshaw–curtis quadrature;code;computation;computer cluster;control theory;courant–friedrichs–lewy condition;degree of a polynomial;discontinuous galerkin method;discretization;displacement mapping;distortion;embedded system;flops;finite difference method;finite element method;gaussian quadrature;gauss–jacobi quadrature;heuristic;hexahedron;image resolution;interpolation;lagrange polynomial;legendre polynomials;legendre transformation;linear algebra;mass matrix;mesh generation;message passing interface;misiurewicz point;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical partial differential equations;numerical stability;parallel computing;polygon mesh;preprocessor;refinement (computing);reflections of signals on conducting lines;rudolf m. tromp;run time (program lifecycle phase);sampling (signal processing);simulation;software propagation;spectral element method;synthetic intelligence;time complexity;topography;unstructured grid;weak formulation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Emanuele Casarotti;Marco Stupazzini;Shiann Lee;Dimitri Komatitsch;Antonio Piersanti;Jeroen Tromp	2007			seismology;geology;hydrology;geotechnical engineering	HPC	93.46514157269432	10.911302630238904	91456
032a8117d7fa6044cebecb5ccc67a380c07369c1	a fast algorithm for radiative transport in isotropic media		We propose in this work a fast numerical algorithm for solving the equation of radiative transfer (ERT) in isotropic media. The algorithm has two steps. In the first step, we derive an integral equation for the angularly averaged ERT solution by taking advantage of the isotropy of the scattering kernel, and solve the integral equation with a fast multipole method (FMM). In the second step, we solve a scattering-free transport equation to recover the original ERT solution. Numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the performance of the algorithm for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous media.	algorithm;computational fluid dynamics;electrical resistivity tomography;fast multipole method;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;simulation	Kui Ren;Rongting Zhang;Yimin Zhong	2016	CoRR		classical mechanics;mathematical optimization;calculus;physics	EDA	91.62538082784346	8.506382062105867	91590

The investigation concentrates on the first-order correction to the homogenized eigenvalues. A major difficulty arises due to the interaction of the periodic microstructure with the boundary of the medium. The way in which the boundary intersects the underlying periodic structure strongly influences the value of the correction. A rigorous derivation is given of the eigenvalue correction formula.

5a8c4d223f15588e9c2e23059a170693e357c5ed	a third-order compact gas-kinetic scheme on unstructured meshes for compressible navier-stokes solutions	compact reconstruction;unstructured mesh;gas kinetic scheme;weighted least square reconstruction;high order scheme	In this paper, for the first time a compact third-order gas-kinetic scheme is proposed on unstructured meshes for the compressible viscous flow computations. The possibility to design such a third-order compact scheme is due to the high-order gas evolution model, where a time-dependent gas distribution function at a cell interface not only provides the fluxes across a cell interface, but also the time evolution of the flow variables at the cell interface as well. As a result, both cell averaged and cell interface flow variables can be used for the initial data reconstruction at the beginning of next time step. A weighted least-square reconstruction has been used for the construction of a third-order initial condition. Therefore, a compact third-order gas-kinetic scheme with the involvement of neighboring cells only can be developed on unstructured meshes. In comparison with other conventional high-order schemes, the current method avoids the use of Gaussian points for the flux integration along a cell interface and the multi-stage Runge-Kutta time stepping technique. The third-order compact scheme is numerically stable under CFL condition above 0.5. Due to the multidimensional gas-kinetic formulation and the coupling of inviscid and viscous terms, even with unstructured meshes the boundary layer solution and the vortex structure can be accurately captured in the current scheme. At the same time, the compact scheme can capture strong shocks as well.		Liang Pan;Kun Xu	2016	J. Comput.

This equation has several different families of nonlinear wave solutions: solitons, the so-called ”thick” solitons, algebraic solitons, and breathers, depending upon the sign of the cubic nonlinear term. A simple nonlinear dynamical system of the second order for the amplitude and position of the solitary wave is dervived, and used to study the interaction. Its solutions are investigated in the phase plane. The conditions for the capture or reflection of a solitary wave by a single isolated external force are obtained, with an emphasis on the role of the cubic nonlinear term.	approximation;cubic function;dynamical system;expectation propagation;linear algebra;nonlinear system;soliton	Roger Grimshaw;Efim Pelinovsky	2002	I.

The problem is challenging due to its multiscale nature (temperature usually propagates orders of magnitude faster than moisture), different characters of the two fields (moisture exhibits boundary layers which are not present in the temperature field), extremely long integration times (30 years or more), and lack of viable error control mechanisms. In order to solve the problem efficiently, we employ a novel multimesh adaptive higher-order finite element method (hp-FEM) based on dynamical meshes and adaptive time step control. We investigate the possibility to approximate the temperature and humidity fields on individual dynamical meshes equipped with mutually independent adaptivity mechanisms.

Unlike the case where the viscosity remains constant, its discretization may be quite cumbersome especially for high-order staggered formulations. To circumvent this problem, we propose an alternative form of the viscous term whose discretization is straightforward. Notice that this approach is also suitable for eddy-viscosity models for Large-Eddy Simulation. Moreover, since it is based on already available operators, it can be easily implemented on any structured or unstructured code. The (supra)convergence of the method is numerically shown on both a fourth-order Cartesian staggered and an unstructured collocated formulation.	discretization	F.

However, for large problems, the computation of the L-curve can be quite expensive, because the determination of a point on the L-curve requires that both the norm of the regularized approximate solution and the norm of the corresponding residual vector be available. Recently, an approximation of the L-curve, referred to as the L-ribbon, was introduced to address this difficulty. The present paper discusses how to organize the computation of the L-ribbon when the matrix of the linear system of equations has many more columns than rows. Numerical examples include an application to computerized tomography.	approximation algorithm;ct scan;column (database);computation;condition number;lanczos resampling;linear system;matrix regularization;system of linear equations;the matrix;tomography;well-posed problem	Daniela Calvetti;Serena Morigi;Lothar Reichel;Fiorella Sgallari	2000	Numerical Algorithms	10.1023/A:1016656923184	system of linear equations;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;calculus;mathematics;underdetermined system;statistics;algebra	ML	83.56521369829298	20.549276246442698	92709

The implicit finite volume scheme satisfies industrial constraints of robustness. We show that the proposed scheme satisfy the maximum principle for the saturation, a discrete energy estimate on the pressures and a function of the saturation that denote capillary terms. These stabilities results allow us to derive the convergence of a subsequence to a weak solution of the continuous equations as the size of the discretization tends to zero. The proof is given for the complete system when the density of the each phase depends on the own pressure.	discretization;finite volume method;principle of maximum entropy;simulation	Bilal Saad;Mazen Saad	2013	SIAM J.

Stability analysis of the phytoplankton-zooplankton model is studied by using the fractional Routh–Hurwitz stability conditions. We have studied the local stability of the equilibrium points. Then a new numerical algorithm, as well as its modification for solving fractional differential equations (FDEs) based on the polynomial interpolation, is proposed. The algorithms are designed to estimate linear and nonlinear FDEs and they have the capability to apply for solving fractional order systems. The convergence order and stability of the fractional higher order algorithms are proved and stability regions of the algorithms are achieved. Extensive numerical simulation results are provided and compared with the literature for illustrating the effectiveness and applicability of the presented algorithms to solve fractional differential equations. The obtained analytical results are validated by numerical simulations and the global dynamics of the model system is studied.	algorithm;nonlinear system	Mohammad Shahbazi Asl;Mohammad Javidi	2018	J.

Numerical results are presented for sample problems. Introduction C0-Galerkin techniques presently constitute the most widely applied class of finite element methods for boundary-value problems. A variety of special finite element methods have been proposed in recent years.

The flow satisfies the slip condition on the walls and the flow velocity is prescribed at the inlet. First, it is proved that if the incoming flow is away from the sonic and vacuum states and its streamlines diverge at the inlet, then a flow in a straight nozzle never approaches the sonic and vacuum states in any bounded region. Furthermore, a sufficient and necessary condition of the incoming flow at the inlet is derived for the existence of a global smooth supersonic flow in a straight nozzle. Then, it is shown that for each incoming flow satisfying this condition, there exists uniquely a global smooth supersonic flow in a symmetric nozzle with convex upper wall.

Impulsive and dipolar terms arise in the dynamic equations, which do not seem to alter the piecewise well known solutions. It is proved in the paper that the addition of a null distribution to the original expression of the displacements, produces non-null effects on the response of the system, with the impact obeying to a strongly non-linear equation.

We will introduce an a posteriori error estimator and derive reliability and efficiency estimates which are explicit with respect to the wavenumber and the discretization parameters h and p. In contrast to the conventional conforming finite element method for indefinite problems, the dG formulation is unconditionally stable and the adaptive discretization process may start from a very coarse initial mesh.

Then, two H 1-Galerkin mixed finite element schemes combined with the higher accurate interpolation approximation are introduced and analyzed to solve the distributed order fractional sub-diffusion equations. The stable results, which just depend on initial value and source item, are derived. Some a priori estimates with optimal order of convergence both for the unknown function and its flux are established rigorously. It is shown that the H 1-Galerkin mixed finite element approximations have the same rates of the convergence as in the classical mixed finite element method, but without LBB consistency condition and quasiuniformity requirement on the finite element mesh. Finally, some numerical experiments are presented to show the efficiency and accuracy of H 1-Galerkin mixed finite element schemes.	approximation;experiment;finite element method;interpolation;navier–stokes equations;numerical analysis;rate of convergence	Xiaoli Li;Hongxing Rui	2018	Numerical Algorithms	10.1007/s11075-018-0476-4		HPC	88.37679333989341	13.51242636856909	93673

cbc189716dd8067c3fc0548bb63c9464c2b03a78	a robust and efficient finite volume method for compressible inviscid and viscous two-phase flows		Abstract A robust and efficient density-based finite volume method is developed for solving the six-equation single pressure system of two-phase flows at all speeds on hybrid unstructured grids. Unlike conventional approaches where an expensive exact Riemann solver is normally required for computing numerical fluxes at the two-phase interfaces in addition to AUSM-type fluxes for single-phase interfaces in order to maintain stability and robustness in cases involving interactions of strong pressure and void-fraction discontinuities, a volume-fraction coupling term for the AUSM + -up fluxes is introduced in this work to impart the required robustness without the need of the exact Riemann solver. The resulting method is significantly less expensive in regions where otherwise the Riemann solver would be invoked. A transformation from conservative variables to primitive variables is presented and the primitive variables are then solved in the implicit method in order for the current finite volume method to be able to solve, effectively and efficiently, low Mach number flows in traditional multiphase applications, which otherwise is a great challenge for the standard density-based algorithms. A number of benchmark test cases are presented to assess the performance and robustness of the developed finite volume method for both inviscid and viscous two-phase flow problems. The numerical results indicate that the current density-based method provides an attractive and viable alternative to its pressure-based counterpart for compressible two-phase flows at all speeds.	finite volume method;two-phase locking	Aditya K.

The start-up conditions for semiconductor process and device simulations claim an initial mesh preparation that is performed by so-called Laplace refinement. The basic idea is to solve Laplace's equation on an initial coarse mesh with Dirichlet boundary conditions.

The benefit of these systems are that, by integration over the water depth, a two-dimensional system is obtained which approximates the full three-dimensional problem. Nevertheless, for most applications the need to propagate waves over many wavelengths means that the numerical solution of these equations remains particularly challenging. The requirement for an accurate discretisation in geometrically complex domains makes the use of spectral/hp elements attractive. However, to allow for the possibility of discontinuous solutions the most natural formulation of the system is within a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) framework. In this paper we consider the unstructured spectral/hp DG formulation of (i) weakly nonlinear dispersive Boussinesq equations and (ii) nonlinear shallow water equations (a subset of the Boussinesq equations). Discretisation of the Boussinesq equations involves resolving third order mixed derivatives. To efficiently handle these high order terms a new scalar formulation based on the divergence of the momentum equations is presented. Numerical computations illustrate the exponential convergence with regard to expansion order and finally, we simulate solitary wave solutions.	computation;discontinuous galerkin method;discretization;dispersive partial differential equation;nonlinear system;numerical method;numerical partial differential equations;simulation;soliton;time complexity	Claes Eskilsson;Spencer J.

We note that in general the higher order finite element spaces exhibit more local behavior than lower order spaces. As a consequence of these estimates new types of error expansions will be derived which are in the form of inequalities. These expansion inequalities are valid for large classes of finite elements defined on irregular grids in RN and have applications to superconvergence and extrapolation and a posteriori estimates. Part II of this series will contain local estimates applicable to non–smooth problems. 0. Introduction and discussion of results This is the first of a series of papers whose aim is to derive new pointwise error estimates for the finite element method on general quasi–uniform meshes for second order elliptic boundary value problems in R , N ≥ 2. In a sense to be discussed below, these estimates represent an improvement on the now standard quasi–optimal L∞ estimates. In order to fix the ideas, here we will deal with global estimates for a model Neumann problem with smooth solutions. In succeeding papers, local estimates, both interior and up to the boundary, which are applicable to a variety of problems with both smooth and nonsmooth solutions will be considered. As a consequence of these estimates, some new and useful inequalities will be given which are in the form of error expansions. They are valid for large classes of finite elements on general quasi–uniform meshes in R and have application to superconvergence and extrapolation and a posteriori esitmates. Let us begin by giving a brief description of some of the main results of this paper. Let Ω be a bounded domain in R , N ≥ 2, with smooth boundary ∂Ω.

The time discretization is performed by using a four-level average difference technique for solving the fluid velocity independently from the density. At this stage, the numerical solution is easily solved by using the presented method since it does not require an extra effort to deal with a nonlinear term and the density. The existence and uniqueness of the numerical solution and the conservation of mass are guaranteed. The stability and convergence of the numerical solution with second-order accuracy on both space and time are also verified. Numerical results are carried out to confirm the accuracy of our theoretical results and the efficiency of the scheme. To illustrate the effectiveness and the advantage of the proposed method, the results at long-time behavior are compared with the ones obtained from previously known methods. Moreover, in the computation, the present method is applied to the collision of solitons under the effect of variable parameters. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

bb6de301d06d87e93999dca47c194b3610e2148b	applying the sparse grid combination technique in linear gyrokinetics		The coming large fusion experiment ITER will heavily benefit from numerical simulations. One model for simulating the hot plasmas occurring in such a device are the gyrokinetic equations, which can resolve the micro-turbulence in the plasma. Due to their moderately high dimensionality they could profit from using sparse grids. Since the highly efficient and paral-lelized simulation code GENE is already at hand, the sparse grid combination technique can be used to create sparse grid solutions. In this way, the full parallelism of GENE can be used and on top of it, another layer of parallelism is introduced. This approach can on the one hand be one step toward exascale computations, since it the parallelism acts on top of the current application. On the other hand it can also be used to reduce the effect of hardware faults, which will probably occur more often on exascale architectures. We will present some results of the combination technique for the special case of linear computations in GENE. For that the optimized combination technique is used, which allows to adapt the coefficients for combination to the underlying problem, which is in our case an eigenvalue problem. It computes its combination coefficients out of an optimization problem, which is also including the search for single eigenvalues of the system. In the end, the method will have retrieved an approximation of the eigenvalue and a representation of the eigenvector in the basis of the partial solutions used for combination. This method can also be generalized to other basis functions than the partial solutions and might thus be also employed for more general problems than the gyrokinetic eigenvalue problem.	approximation;basis function;coefficient;computation;computer simulation;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimization problem;parallel computing;plasma display;sparse grid;sparse matrix;turbulence	Christoph Kowitz	2016				HPC	87.17083314475981	24.270556744030124	94716

Let Ω be a bounded region in R, n ≥ 2, with Lipschitz continuous boundary Γ. In the motivating structural acoustics application, Ω represents an acoustic cavity. Let Γ0 be a flat subset of Γ which represents a flexible wall of the cavity. Let z denote the acoustic velocity potential, which satisfies a wave equation in Ω, and let v denote the displacement on Γ0, which satisfies a Kirchoff plate equation on Γ0. These equations are coupled via ∂z/∂ν = vt on Γ0 (where ν is the exterior unit normal to Γ0), and the backpressure −zt appears in the Kirchoff equation. In the first problem, we consider a control u0 in the Kirchoff equation on Γ0, and an additional control u1 in the Neumann conditions on a subset Γ1 of Γ, where Γ \ Γ1 satisfies geometric conditions. Using both controls, we obtain exact controllability of the wave and plate components in the natural state space. In the second problem we consider only the control u0. Without geometric conditions, exact controllability is not possible, but we show that for any initial data, we can steer the plate component exactly, and the wave component approximately. ∗This work was partially supported by NSF grant DMS-0196359 . †This work was partially supported by NSF grant DMS-0104305 and ARO grant DAAD19-02-1-0179. ‡This work was partially supported by NSF grant DMS-0206951.	acoustic cryptanalysis;displacement mapping;ibm notes;normal (geometry);regular expression;state space;velocity (software development)	George Avalos;Irena Lasiecka;Richard Rebarber	2003	Systems & Control Letters	10.1016/S0167-6911(03)00179-8	mathematical optimization;wave equation;mathematical analysis;state space;control theory;mathematics;lipschitz continuity;satisfiability	Theory	83.72096384092252	7.31041570829992	94720
589c00fec6f67219e8da64b4316f1aefd60d674a	a primal-dual method for optimal control and trajectory generation in high-dimensional systems		Presented is a method for efficient computation of the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equation for time-optimal control problems using the generalized Hopf formula. Typically, numerical methods to solve the HJ equation rely on a discrete grid of the solution space and exhibit exponential scaling with dimension. The generalized Hopf formula avoids the use of grids and numerical gradients by formulating an unconstrained convex optimization problem. The solution at each point is completely independent, and allows a massively parallel implementation if solutions at multiple points are desired. This work presents a primal-dual method for efficient numeric solution and presents how the resulting optimal trajectory can be generated directly from the solution of the Hopf formula, without further optimization. Examples presented have execution times on the order of milliseconds and experiments show computation scales approximately polynomial in dimension with very small high-order coefficients.	coefficient;compiled language;compiler;computation;convex optimization;experiment;feasible region;gradient;hamilton–jacobi–bellman equation;heterojunction;jacobi method;matlab;mathematical optimization;numerical method;optimal control;optimization problem;polynomial;time complexity	Matthew R.

These problems include ray tracing, interference detection, polygonal decomposition of parametric surfaces, and CSG on solids bounded by parametric surfaces. Only two basic algorithms are required:SOLVE, which computes solutions to a system of constraints, andMINIMIZE, which computes the global minimum of a function, subject to a system of constraints. We present algorithms for SOLVE andMINIMIZE using interval analysis as the conceptual framework. Crucial to the technique is the creation of “inclusion functions” for each constraint and function to be minimized. Inclusion functions compute a bound on the range of a function, given a similar bound on its domain, allowing a branch and bound approach to constraint solution and constrained minimization. Inclusion functions also allow the MINIMIZE algorithm to compute global rather than local minima, unlike many other numerical algorithms. Some very recent theoretical results are presented regarding existence and uniqueness of roots of nonlinear equations, and global parameterizability of implicitly described manifolds. To illustrate the power of the approach, the basic algorithms are further developed into a new algorithm for the approximation of implicit curves.

998f61b411bb3dfec77bfac6cbcdf8c8badb27c4	a mach-sensitive implicit-explicit scheme adapted to compressible multi-scale flows		The method presented below focuses on the numerical approximation of the Euler compressible system. It pursues a two-fold objective: being able to accurately follow slow material waves as well as strong shock waves in the context of low Mach number flows. The resulting implicit-explicit fractional step approach leans on a dynamic splitting designed to react to the time fluctuations of the maximal flow Mach number. When the latter rises suddenly, the IMEX scheme, so far driven by a material-wave Courant number, turn into a time-explicit approximate Riemann solver constrained by an acoustic-wave Courant number. It is also possible to enrich the dynamic splitting in order to capture high pressure jumps even when the flow Mach number is low. One-dimensional low Mach number test cases involving single or multiple waves confirm that the present approach is as accurate and efficient as an IMEX Lagrange-Projection method. Besides, numerical results suggest that the stability of the present method holds for any Mach number if the Courant number related to the convective subsystem arising from the splitting is of order unity.	acoustic cryptanalysis;approximation algorithm;courant–friedrichs–lewy condition;euler;explicit and implicit methods;mach;maximal set;maximum flow problem;numerical analysis;riemann solver;test case	D.

In order to derive an efficient numerical scheme to solve the equations, we first convert the original equation into an equivalent reaction-diffusion problem with an exponential transformation. Then, we propose a fully discrete scheme by combining the Crank-Nicolson method and the Legendre spectral Galerkin method. The analytical and numerical stability criteria are obtained in L 2 -norm. It is proven under the suitable conditions that the method is convergent of second-order in time and of exponential order in space.

797eb2e927c180bd2c9cf8938a6aac68195f55ec	a pseudo energy-invariant method for relativistic wave equations with riesz space-fractional derivatives		Abstract In this work, we investigate a general nonlinear wave equation with Riesz space-fractional derivatives that generalizes various classical hyperbolic models, including the sine-Gordon and the Klein–Gordon equations from relativistic quantum mechanics. A finite-difference discretization of the model is provided using fractional centered differences. The method is a technique that is capable of preserving an energy-like quantity at each iteration. Some computational comparisons against solutions available in the literature are performed in order to assess the capability of the method to preserve the invariant. Our experiments confirm that the technique yields good approximations to the solutions considered. As an application of our scheme, we provide simulations that confirm, for the first time in the literature, the presence of the phenomenon of nonlinear supratransmission in Riesz space-fractional Klein–Gordon equations driven by a harmonic perturbation at the boundary.	relativistic wave equations	Jorge Eduardo Macías-Díaz;Ahmed S.

This method is based on the reconnection-based ALE (ReALE) methodology of Refs. 35,34,6. The main elements in a standard ReALE method are: an explicit Lagrangian phase on an arbitrary polygonal (in 2D) mesh in which the solution and positions of grid nodes are updated; a rezoning phase in which a new grid is defined by changing the connectivity (using Voronoi tessellation) but not the number of cells; and a remapping phase in which the Lagrangian solution is transferred onto the new grid. In the standard ReALE method, the rezoned mesh is smoothed by using one or several steps toward centroidal Voronoi tessellation, but it is not adapted to the solution in any way.In the current paper we present a new adaptive ReALE method, A-ReALE, that is based on the following design principles. First, a monitor function (or error indicator) based on the Hessian of some flow parameter(s) is utilized. Second, an equi-distribution principle for the monitor function is used as a criterion for adapting the mesh. Third, a centroidal Voronoi tessellation is used to adapt the mesh. Fourth, we scale the monitor function to avoid very small and large cells and then smooth it to permit the use of theoretical results related to weighted centroidal Voronoi tessellation.In the A-ReALE method, both number of cells and their locations are allowed to change at the rezone stage on each time step. The number of generators at each time step is chosen to guarantee the required spatial resolution in regions where monitor function reaches its maximum value.We present all details required for implementation of new adaptive A-ReALE method and demonstrate its performance in comparison with standard ReALE method on series of numerical examples.	euler method;lagrangian and eulerian specification of the flow field	Wurigen Bo;Mikhail J.

Several critical engineering phenomena like contaminant spread, nuclear waste disposal and oil recovery rely on accurate analysis and prediction of these multiscale phenomena. Such analysis is complicated by inherent uncertainties as well as the limited information available to characterize the system. Any realistic modelling of these transport phenomena has to resolve two key issues: (i) the multi-length scale variations in permeability that these systems exhibit, and (ii) the inherently limited information available to quantify these property variations that necessitates posing these phenomena as stochastic processes. A stochastic variational multiscale formulation is developed to incorporate uncertain multiscale features. A stochastic analogue to a mixed multiscale finite element framework is used to formulate the physical stochastic multiscale process. Recent developments in linear and non-linear model reduction techniques are used to convert the limited information available about the permeability variation into a viable stochastic input model. An adaptive sparse grid collocation strategy is used to efficiently solve the resulting stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). The framework is applied to analyze flow through random heterogeneous media when only limited statistics about the permeability variation are given.	calculus of variations;collocation;computation;computational mathematics;finite element method;linear model;multiscale modeling;nonlinear system;snapshot (computer storage);sparse grid;sparse matrix;stochastic optimization;stochastic process;variational principle	Baskar Ganapathysubramanian;Nicholas Zabaras	2009	J.

We focus on the effects induced by the discontinuity of the capillarity field at interface. We first consider a model with capillarity forces within the rocks, stating an existence/uniqueness result. Then we look for the asymptotic problem for vanishing capillarity within the rocks, remaining only on the interface. We show that either the solution to the asymptotic problem is the entropy solution to a scalar conservation law with discontinuous flux, or it admits a non-classical shock at the interface.	reflections of signals on conducting lines;two-phase commit protocol;two-phase locking	Clément Cancès	2010	NHM	10.3934/nhm.2010.5.635	mathematics;two-phase flow;porous medium	Theory	87.71627308469154	5.608600873422844	96173
e74fe2feb4e8b138575c68538c61a4041099c3c0	mathematical modeling of thermal stabilization of vertical wells on high performance computing systems		Temperature stabilization of oil and gas wells is used to ensure stability and prevent deformation of a subgrade estuary zone. In this work, we consider the numerical simulation of thermal stabilization using vertical seasonal freezing columns. A mathematical model of such problems is described by a time-dependent temperature equation with phase transitions from water to ice. The resulting equation is a standard nonlinear parabolic equation. Numerical implementation is based on the finite element method using the package Fenics. After standard purely implicit approximation in time and simple linearization, we obtain a system of linear algebraic equations. Because the size of freezing columns are substantially less than the size of the modeled area, we obtain mesh refinement near columns. Due to this, we get a large system of equations which are solved using high performance computing systems. 1 Mathematical model We consider a mathematical model that describes the distribution of temperature with phase transitions at a given temperature T ∗ in a domain Ω = Ω−∪Ω+. Here Ω(t) is a domain with liquid phase, where the temperature is above the phase transition temperature Ω(t) = {x|x ∈ Ω, T (x, t) > T ∗} and Ω−(t) stands for a domain with solid phase, Ω−(t) = {x|x ∈ Ω, T (x, t) < T ∗}. The phase transition occurs at a phase change boundary S = S(t). For simulation of heat transfer with phase transitions, the classical Stefan model is used [1], [2]. This model describes the thermal processes accompanied 1 ar X iv :1 30 4. 16 25 v1 [ cs .C E ] 5 A pr 2 01 3 by a phase change media, absorption and release of latent heat. We use ( α(φ) + ρ+Lφ′ )(∂T ∂t − ( k μ grad p, gradT )) − div (λ(φ) gradT ) = 0, (1) where L is thelatent heat of the phase transition, k stands for the absolute permeability of the porous medium, μ is the water viscosity and p is the pressure in the soil. For the coefficients of the equation, we have the following relations α(φ) = ρ−c− + φ(ρc − ρ−c−), λ(φ) = λ− + φ(λ − λ−), and φ = { 0, T < T ∗, 1, T > T ∗, where ρ, c ρ−, c− are the density and specific heat capacity of the melt and frozen zone, respectively. Since we consider the process of heat propagation in porous media, then for the coefficients we have: c−ρ− = (1−m)cscρsc +mciρi, cρ = (1−m)cscρsc +mcwρw, where m is the porosity. Indexes sc, w, i denote the skeleton of the porous medium, water and ice. For the coefficients of thermal conductivity in the melt and frozen zone, we have similar relationships λ− = (1−m)λsc +mλi, λ = (1−m)λsc +mλw. In practice, phase transformations do not occur instantaneously and can occur in a small temperature range [T ∗ −∆, T ∗ + ∆] [1]. As the φ-function, we can take φ∆: φ∆ =  0, T ≤ T ∗ −∆, T − T ∗ + ∆ 2∆ , T ∗ −∆ < T < T ∗ + ∆, 1, T ≥ T ∗ + ∆, φ∆ =  0, T ≤ T ∗ −∆, 1 2∆ , T ∗ −∆ < T < T ∗ + ∆, 0, T ≥ T ∗ + ∆. Then we obtain the following equation for the temperature in the domain Ω: (α(φ∆) + ρlLφ ′ ∆) ( ∂T ∂t + u gradT ) − div(λ(φ∆) gradT ) = 0.

In the case of occurring high-order chemical reactions, the zero production term in traditional models should be modified to a nonlinear term related with time (or space) and solute concentration, and then a mathematical model with nonlinear terms is put forward. Furthermore, an actual soil-column experiment in Zhangdian, Zibo is investigated. By applying an optimal perturbation algorithm, the source coefficient in the model is determined both in the cases of accurate data and inaccurate data. The inversion results show that for such inverse source coefficient problems with limited additional data, some optimal methods could be more efficient than regularization strategies, and for some real equilibrium soil-column experiments, the process of source (sink) reactions could be a key factor in the solute transportation. 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The orientations and arrangements of the grains and their network of boundaries are implicated in many properties across wide scales, for example, functional properties, like conductivity in microprocessors, and lifetime properties, like fracture toughness in structures. Simulation is becoming an important tool for understanding both materials properties and their processing requirements. Here we offer a consistent variational approach to the mesoscale simulation of these systems subject to the Mullins equation of curvature-driven growth in a two-dimensional setting. The main objective is to provide a calibration for future two-dimensional and three-dimensional efforts. We discuss several novel features of our approach, which we anticipate will render it a flexible, scalable, and robust tool to aid in microstructural prediction. Simulation results offer compelling evidence of the predictability and robustness of statistical properties of large systems, such as grain size distribution and texture, that are of immediate interest in materials science.	microprocessor;requirement;scalability;simulation;variational principle	David Kinderlehrer;Irene Livshits;Shlomo Ta'asan	2006	SIAM J.

Thus, the modular domain decomposition approach already assessed with exact techniques such as BEM and FEM is conserved, with the utilization of GO/PO/PTD techniques, resulting in an important reduction of CPU time during parametric studies. As the coupling scheme between asymptotic and exact methods is based on the Lorentz reciprocity theorem, the external structure of the large object is considered perfectly conducting. The accuracy and efficiency of this technique is assessed by performing the computation of the diffraction and radiation by several test-objects in a multi-domain way, cross compared with reference integral equation results.	boundary element method	André Barka;Nicolas Douchin	2012	Computer Physics Communications	10.1016/j.cpc.2012.04.015	ray tracing;mathematical optimization;calculus;mathematics;geometry	AI	91.8679281611208	8.626822813883077	96403

We show how to harness the computational power of GPUs and solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes fluid equations significantly faster (more than one order of magnitude in average) than on CPU solvers of comparable cost. While past approaches typically used Stam’s implicit solver, we use a variation of SMAC (Simplified Marker and Cell). SMAC is widely used in engineering applications, where experimental reproducibility is essential. Thus, we show that the GPU is a viable and affordable processor for scientific applications. Our solver works with general rectangular domains (possibly with obstacles), implements a variety of boundary conditions and incorporates energy transport through the traditional Boussinesq approximation. Finally, we discuss the implications of our solver in light of future GPU features, and possible extensions such as three-dimensional domains and free-boundary problems.	approximation;cell (microprocessor);central processing unit;graphics hardware;graphics processing unit;navier–stokes equations;rasterisation;sid meier's alpha centauri;solver	Carlos Eduardo Scheidegger;João Luiz Dihl Comba;Rudnei Dias da Cunha	2005	Comput.

The proposed strategy builds on a tabulated look-up table method based on REFPROP database for an accurate estimation of non-linear behaviors of thermodynamic and fluid transport properties at the transcritical conditions. Based on the look-up table method we propose a numerical method that satisfies high-order spatial accuracy, spurious-oscillation-free property, and capability of capturing the abrupt variation in thermodynamic properties across the transcritical contact surface. The method introduces artificial mass diffusivity to the continuity and momentum equations in a physically-consistent manner in order to capture the steep transcritical thermodynamic variations robustly while maintaining spurious-oscillation-free property in the velocity field. The pressure evolution equation is derived from the full compressible Navier-Stokes equations and solved instead of solving the total energy equation to achieve the spurious pressure oscillation free property with an arbitrary equation of state including the present look-up table method. Flow problems with and without physical diffusion are employed for the numerical tests to validate the robustness, accuracy, and consistency of the proposed approach.	numerical method;turbulence	Soshi Kawai;Hiroshi Terashima;Hideyo Negishi	2015	J.

In this Lagrangian approach, the particles can become severely strained, which for continuum representations results in a deterioration of spatial accuracy. Thus, most workers face the need to remediate sets of particles so that the basis functions do not cease to overlap in space. While various investigators have developed means for replacing a set of particles with another that is more uniform, this subject is rarely addressed in the literature. The more general problem is that of finding a set of basis functions such that the field of interest is well represented by their superposition. We refer to this procedure as field interpolation. One approach is to formulate this as a radial basis function interpolation problem, which with global methods, will result in a dense and ill-conditioned system that needs to be solved. In particle simulation of fluid flow, a recent advance incorporates deforming basis functions to provide fourth-order accuracy in space. The requirement of an accurate field interpolation scheme becomes more stringent in this context, to maintain the overall high order. We have developed methods for performing field interpolation in this application, using custom preconditioning with iterative methods on the one hand, and deblurring techniques from image processing on the other.	condition number;deblurring;discretization;image processing;interpolation;iterative method;lagrangian (field theory);numerical analysis;preconditioner;quantum superposition;radial (radio);radial basis function;scope (computer science);simulation;triune continuum paradigm	Lorena A.

In the limit of small activator diiusivity, a one-spike solution to this non-local model is constructed. The spectrum of the eigenvalue problem associated with the linearization of the non-local model around such an isolated spike solution is studied in both a one-dimensional and a multi-dimensional context. It is shown that the principal eigenvalues in the spectrum are exponentially small in the limit of small activator diiusivity. The non-local term in the eigenvalue problem is essential for ensuring the existence of such exponentially small principal eigenvalues. These eigenvalues are responsible for the occurrence of an exponentially slow, or metastable, spike-layer motion for the time-dependent problem. Explicit metastable spike dynamics are derived by using a projection method, which enforces a limiting solvability condition on the solution to the linearized problem.	aharonov–bohm effect;computation;local interconnect network;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;numerical analysis;numerical method;the spike (1997)	David Iron;Michael J.

The motion of the crystal–matrix interface and the thermal evolution are prescribed functions of time. The motion of the interface is discretized and it advances from one cell boundary to next as the prescribed interface position passes the cell center. The appropriate conditions for the flux across the crystal–matrix interface are derived from discrete mass conservation. Numerical results are benchmarked against steady and transient analytic solutions for isothermal diffusion with partitioning and growth. Two applications illustrate the ability of the model to reproduce observed rare-earth element patterns in garnets (Skora et al., 2006) and water concentration profiles around spherulites in obsidian (Watkins et al., 2009). Simulations with diffusion inside the growing crystal show complex concentration evolutions for trace elements with high diffusion coefficients, such as argon or hydrogen, but demonstrate that rare-earth element concentrations in typical metamorphic garnets are not affected by intracrystalline diffusion. & 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

1517bedb6e0f07de13be29158c8d00291cf68418	dispersive homogenized models and coefficient formulas for waves in general periodic media	wave equation	We analyze a homogenization limit for the linear wave equation of second order. The spatial operator is assumed to be of divergence form with an oscillatory coefficient matrix aε that is periodic with characteristic length scale ε; no spatial symmetry properties are imposed. Classical homogenization theory allows to describe solutions uε well by a non-dispersive wave equation on fixed time intervals (0, T ). Instead, when larger time intervals are considered, dispersive effects are observed. In this contribution we present a well-posed weakly dispersive equation with homogeneous coefficients such that its solutions wε describe uε well on time intervals (0, T ε−2). More precisely, we provide a norm and uniform error estimates of the form ‖uε(t)−wε(t)‖ ≤ Cε for t ∈ (0, T ε−2). They are accompanied by computable formulas for all coefficients in the effective models. We additionally provide an ε-independent equation of third order that describes dispersion along rays and we present numerical examples.	algebraic riccati equation;coefficient;computable function;dispersive partial differential equation;numerical analysis;well-posed problem	Tomás Dohnal;Agnes Lamacz;Ben Schweizer	2015	Asymptotic Analysis	10.3233/ASY-141280	mathematical optimization;wave equation;mathematical analysis;calculus;mathematics;physics;quantum mechanics	ML	86.79968577772945	7.824722491441445	97144

The classical Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg (RKF) method ignored the local stability, and in the new method the step length will be further adjusted via a local stability parameter, which measurably reflects the fact as the local truncation error is little enough, the local stability might approximately be characterized by the relative error between the initial dependent variable associated with every step and the feedback which may be calculated using a reverse Runge-Kutta (RK) method. The idea is verified with two distinct types of numerical examples, and the results have been shown to advance greatly the accuracy of numerical solution with comparable computed speed relative to the RKF. Subsequently, the RKFR is coupled with the reservoir flood routing process, and integrated into the flood control decision support system of Huanren-Huilong reservoir group in Hunjiang River basin of Northeast China, and the testing result demonstrates it is more scientific and reliable compared with the RKF and RK.	algorithm;approximation error;decision support system;first-order predicate;linux/rk;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical partial differential equations;routing;runge–kutta methods;runge–kutta–fehlberg method;syn flood;truncation error (numerical integration)	Xuguang Li;Ben Pin-Yun Wang	2007	Third International Conference on Natural Computation (ICNC 2007)	10.1109/ICNC.2007.646	mathematical optimization;geography;hydrology;geotechnical engineering	Robotics	92.97862022077797	12.982496124096464	97167

Numer. Anal. 36(2), 824–850 [17]) in which the biharmonic problems are first decomposed into lower order problems, most often either into two Poisson problems or into two Poisson problems and a homogeneous biharmonic problem. One of the steps in the “decomposition algorithm” as discussed in Ghosh and Daripa (IMA J. Numer. Anal. 36(2), 824–850 [17]) for solving certain biharmonic problems uses the “direct algorithm” without which the problem can not be solved. Using classical Green’s function approach for these biharmonic problems, solutions of these problems are represented in terms of singular integrals in the complex z−plane (the physical plane) involving explicitly the boundary conditions. Analysis of these singular integrals using FFT and recursive relations (RR) in Fourier space leads to the development of these fast algorithms which are called FFTRR based algorithms. These algorithms do not need to do anything special to overcome coordinate singularity at the origin as often the case when solving these problems using finite difference methods in polar coordinates. These algorithms have some other desirable properties such as the ease of implementation and parallel in nature by construction. Moreover, these algorithms have O(logN) complexity per grid point where N 2 is the total number of grid points and have very low constant behind this order estimate of the complexity. Performance of these algorithms is shown on several test problems. These algorithms are applied to solving viscous flow problems at low and moderate Reynolds numbers and numerical results are presented.	algorithm;boundary case;comstock–needham system;fast fourier transform;finite difference method;numerical analysis;recursion;reynolds-averaged navier–stokes equations;round-robin scheduling;time complexity	Prabir Daripa;Aditi Ghosh	2016	Numerical Algorithms	10.1007/s11075-016-0226-4	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;calculus;mathematics;algorithm;algebra	Theory	91.30047432691003	14.79924433712672	97174

The method is for use when (a) the amount of work in the calculation of the theoretical values is large as compared with the amount required to solve a set of linear equations in the same number of unknowns; and (b) the amount of work in calculating the first order partial derivatives of all the theoretical values with respect to one parameter would be even greater, so that using finite difference approximations to the partial derivatives is preferable. In addition to setting up and solving the normal equations at each step, the latent vectors of their matrix and estimates of the errors on the current parameter values are computed and used. Also the known physical limits of the range of each parameter are used. The procedure has second order convergence.	approximation;emoticon;finite difference;iterative method;linear equation;linear least squares (mathematics);non-linear least squares	R. N.

A numerical parameter, the spacing of the Eulerian grid, is used to determine the effective radius of the immersed sphere or slender body. Such representations are much less expensive computationally than those with two or three-dimensional meshes of Lagrangian points. To perform this test, we develop a numerical method to solve the discretized Stokes equations on an unbounded Eulerian grid which contains an arbitrary configuration of Lagrangian points that apply force to the fluid and that move with the fluid. We compare results computed with this new immersed boundary method to known results for spheres and rigid cylinders in Stokes flow in R. We find that, for certain choices of parameters, the interactions with the fluid of a single Lagrangian point accurately replicate those of a sphere of some particular radius, independent of the location of the point with respect to the Eulerian grid. The interactions of a linear array of Lagrangian points, for certain choices of parameters, accurately replicate those of a cylinder of some particular radius, independent of the position and orientation of the array with respect to the Eulerian grid. The effective radius of the sphere and the effective radius of the cylinder turn out to be related in a simple and natural way. Our results suggest recipes for choosing parameters that should be useful to practitioners. One surprising result is that one must not use too many Lagrangian points in an array. Another is that the approximate delta functions traditionally used in the immersed boundary method perform much better than higher order delta functions with the same support. 2008 Elsevier Inc.

d7e1210f11d8fe8757f11d22b62353dbf4dd4e11	asymptotic expansion of the solution of an interface problem in a polygonal domain with thin layer		We consider the solution of an interface problem posed in a bounded domain coated with a layer of thickness ε and with external boundary conditions of Dirichlet or Neumann type. Our aim is to build a multi-scale expansion as ε goes to 0 for that solution. After presenting a complete multi-scale expansion in a smooth coated domain, we focus on the case of a corner domain. Singularities appear, obstructing the construction of the expansion terms in the same way as in the smooth case. In order to take these singularities into account, we construct profiles in an infinite coated sectorial domain. Combining expansions in the smooth case with splittings in regular and singular parts involving the profiles, we construct two families of multi-scale expansions for the solution in the coated domain with corner. We prove optimal estimates for the remainders of the multiscale expansions.	call of duty: black ops;fo (complexity);multiscale modeling	Gabriel Caloz;Martin Costabel;Monique Dauge;Grégory Vial	2006	Asymptotic Analysis		mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;topology;fictitious domain method;mathematics	Vision	87.15452043477309	5.55719921157899	97689

The stability and convergence of the semi-implicit schemes are analyzed in the L∞ norm. We theoretically prove that the numerical schemes are stable and convergent without the restriction on the ratio of space and time stepsizes and numerically further confirm that the schemes have first order convergence in time and second order convergence in space. Then we discuss the positivity and boundedness properties of the analytical solutions of the discussed model, and show that the numerical solutions preserve the positivity and boundedness. The numerical example is also presented.	discretization;finite difference;lotka–volterra equations;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;petri net;prey;semiconductor industry	Yanyan Yu;Weihua Deng;Yujiang Wu	2015	Computers & Mathematics with Applications	10.1016/j.camwa.2015.02.024	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;fractional calculus;calculus;mathematics	Theory	84.74190293036771	14.689012039784323	97745

The analytic solution of the higher order crack tip fields (similar to the Williams' solution of homogenous material) is obtained by applying the asymptotic series expansion. When non-homogeneous material parameters are degenerated, the solutions become the same as the asymptotic crack tip fields of the homogeneous material. Therefore, the solutions are the basic results of non-homogeneous fracture mechanics, and provide a theoretical basis for solving the fracture problems of one common structure with physical weak-discontinuity.	asymptote;oblique projection;reflections of signals on conducting lines;series expansion;strongly correlated material	Yao Dai;Shimin Li;Junfeng Liu;Xiao Chong	2011	Proceedings of 2011 International Conference on Electronic & Mechanical Engineering and Information Technology	10.1109/EMEIT.2011.6022984	fracture mechanics;structural engineering;closed-form expression;crack closure;higher-order logic;series expansion;computer science;mathematics	Robotics	88.52759425411313	4.743820092360363	97848
643314f752cf2fea9fd7d0ac6281070669aa4f85	full waveform inversion and the truncated newton method	full waveform inversion;90c06;seismic imaging;numerical optimization;86 08;49m15;35r30;large scale inverse problems	Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) is a powerful method for reconstructing subsurface parameters from local measurements of the seismic wavefield. This method consists in minimizing a distance between predicted and recorded data. The predicted data is computed as the solution of a wave propagation problem. Conventional numerical methods for the resolution of FWI problems are gradient-based methods, such as the preconditioned steepest-descent, or more recently the l-BFGS quasi-Newton algorithm. In this study, we investigate the interest of applying a truncated Newton method to FWI. The inverse Hessian operator plays a crucial role in the parameter reconstruction. The truncated Newton method allows one to better account for this operator. This method is based on the computation of the Newton descent direction by solving the corresponding linear system through an iterative procedure such as the conjugate gradient method. The large-scale nature of FWI problems requires however to carefully implement this method to avoid prohibitive computational costs. First, this requires to work in a matrix-free formalism, and the capability of computing efficiently Hessian-vector products. To this purpose, we propose general second-order adjoint state formulas. Second, special attention must be payed to define the stopping criterion for the inner linear iterations associated with the computation of the Newton descent direction. We propose several possibilities and establish a theoretical link between the Steihaug-Toint method, based on trust-regions, and the Eisenstat stopping criterion, designed for method globalized by linesearch. We investigate the application of the truncated Newton method to two test cases: the first is a standard test case in seismic imaging based on the Marmousi II model. The second one is inspired by a nearsurface imaging problem for the reconstruction of high velocity structures. In the latter case, we demonstrate that the presence of large amplitude multi-scattered waves prevents standard methods from converging while the truncated Newton method provides more reliable results.	approximation;benchmark (computing);broyden–fletcher–goldfarb–shanno algorithm;computation;conjugate gradient method;converge;descent direction;dhrystone;early stopping;embedded system;gauss–newton algorithm;gradient descent;gulf of evaluation;hessian;iteration;iterative method;limited-memory bfgs;line search;linear system;newton's method;nonlinear conjugate gradient method;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method;performance;preconditioner;quasi-newton method;salt (cryptography);semantics (computer science);software propagation;solver;test case;truncated newton method;velocity (software development);waveform;white noise	Ludovic Métivier;R.

In order to pass the information among grids we use the values of the fields only at the contact point between them. Surprisingly we obtain a convergent methods which is third order accurate with respect to the spatial resolution. In test cases, at the minimal resolution needed to describe correctly the waves, the error of this approximation is similar to that of a homogeneous (centered differences everywhere) scheme with three points stencil, that is a sixth order finite difference operator. The semi-discrete approximation preserves the norm and uses standard finite difference operators satisfying summation by parts. For the time integrator we use a semi-implicit IMEX Runge Kutta method.	approximation;coefficient;finite difference;numerical analysis;parabolic antenna;plack;quantum mechanics;runge–kutta methods;schrödinger;semiconductor industry;test case	Oscar A.

Our goal is to preserve only the important critical points in the vector field and thus simplify the vector field for the visualization purposes. We use Radial Basis Functions (RBF) approximation with Lagrange multipliers for vector field approximation. The proposed method was experimentally verified on synthetic and real weather forecast data sets. The results proved the quality of the proposed approximation method compared to other existing approaches. A significant contribution of the proposed method is an analytical form of the vector field which can be used in further processing.	analytical engine;approximation algorithm;approximation error;experiment;lagrange multiplier;level of detail;newton's method;radial (radio);radial basis function;relevance;synthetic intelligence	Michal Smolik;Václav Skala;Zuzana Majdisova	2018	Advances in Engineering Software	10.1016/j.advengsoft.2018.06.013	mathematical optimization;critical point (mathematics);vector field;computer science;visualization;lagrange multiplier;radial basis function;data set	Visualization	95.04078498817712	13.417251205821113	98068

The so-called harmonic averaging points located at the interface of heterogeneity are employed to define the auxiliary unknowns. This new scheme is locally conservative, has only cell-centered unknowns and possesses a small stencil, which is five-point on the structured quadrilateral meshes and seven-point on the structured hexahedral meshes. The stability result in H1 norm is obtained under quite general assumptions. Numerical results show that our scheme is robust and extremumpreserving, and the optimal convergence rates are verified on general distorted meshes in case that the diffusion tensor is taken to be anisotropic, at times discontinuous. 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc.	3d computer graphics;a* search algorithm;anisotropic diffusion;approximation algorithm;approximation-preserving reduction;command & conquer:yuri's revenge;domain decomposition methods;experiment;finite volume method;first-order predicate;five-point stencil;gradient;hexahedron;interpolation;maxima and minima;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method;parallel computing;polygon mesh;rate of convergence;stencil buffer;triangle mesh	Zhiming Gao;Jiming Wu	2013	J.

The problem is nonlinear in the sense that the equations of linear elasticity are supplemented by certain contact inequalities. The location of a priori unknown contact zones and the solutions to the field equations must be determined simultaneously. The algorithm is based on a rapidly converging sequence of relaxed Fredholm integral equations of the second kind in which the contact problem is viewed as a perturbation of a noncontacting crack problem. The algorithm exhibits great stability and speed. The numerical results are orders-of-magnitudes more accurate than those of previous investigators.	algorithm;contact order;elasticity (data store);nonlinear system;numerical analysis	Gunnar Peters;Johan Helsing	2000	SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics	10.1137/S0036139999356934	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;numerical analysis;calculus;mathematics;algebra	Robotics	88.19376364640415	9.360420904606674	98285

It is obtained from the three dimensional incompressible magnetohydrodynamic system similarly as the classical shallow water system is obtained from the incompressible NavierStokes equations. The system is hyperbolic and has two additional waves with respect to the shallow water system, the Alfven waves. These are linearly degenerate, and thus do not generate dissipation. In the present work we introduce a 5-wave approximate Riemann solver for the shallow water magnetohydrodynamic system, that has the property to be non dissipative on Alfven waves. It is obtained by solving a relaxation system of Suliciu type, and is similar to HLLC type solvers. The solver is positive and entropy satisfying, ensuring its robustness. It has sharp wave speeds, and does not involve any iterative procedure.	approximation algorithm;entropy (information theory);iterative method;linear programming relaxation;neural oscillation;riemann solver;robustness (computer science)	François Bouchut;Xavier Lhébrard	2016	J.

25ece54f996c1ba2131c2c9ce1276d69836c0fc5	a fully parallelizable space-time multilevel monte carlo method for stochastic differential equations with additive noise		In this work a combination of parallelizable space-time multigrid methods for deterministic parabolic partial differential equations with multilevel Monte Carlo methods for stochastic differential equations with additive noise is developed. Instead of applying the backward Euler--Maruyama scheme sequentially for every time step, the basic idea for the considered space-time method is to solve a large linear system at once, for which a parallelizable multigrid algorithm is constructed that inherits the space-time hierarchy of the multilevel Monte Carlo method. Overall, this results in a fully parallelizable algorithm with respect to space, time, and probability. As model problems for the numerical testing of the proposed method serve in finite dimensions the Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process and in infinite dimensions the stochastic heat equation in 1, 2, and 3 space dimensions.	additive model;additive white gaussian noise;monte carlo method	Martin Neumüller;Andreas Thalhammer	2018	SIAM J.

Boundary integral equations are appealing for large-scale problems, yet certain difficulties have limited their use. We introduce two ideas to remedy this: 1) We solve the resulting nonlinear eigenvalue problem using Boyd’s method for analytic root-finding applied to the Fredholm determinant. We show that this is many times faster than the usual iterative minimization of a singular value. 2) We fix the problem of spurious exterior resonances via a combined-field representation. This also provides the first robust boundary integral eigenvalue method for non-simply-connected domains. We implement the new method in two dimensions using spectrally accurate Nyström product quadrature. We prove exponential convergence of the determinant at roots for domains with analytic boundary. We demonstrate 13-digit accuracy, and improved efficiency, in a variety of domain shapes including a non-convex cavity shape with strong exterior resonances.	a* search algorithm;approximation algorithm;characteristic impedance;concave function;imaginary time;iterative method;matrix regularization;nonlinear system;resonance;root-finding algorithm;singular value decomposition;time complexity	Lin Zhao;Alex H.

For the case of an acoustic wave propagating in a two-dimensional non-dispersive medium, a routine 2nd order in time and space Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) scheme representation of the linear wave equation can be used to solve for the acoustic pressure. However when the medium is dispersive, one is required to take into account the frequency dependent attenuation and phase speed. Until recently to include the dispersive effects one typically solved the problem in the frequency domain and not in the time domain. The frequency domain solutions were Fourier transformed into the time domain. However by using a theory first proposed by Blackstock [D.T. Blackstock, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 77 (1985) 2050. [1]], the linear wave equation has been modified by adding an additional term (the derivative of the convolution between the causal time-domain propagation factor and the acoustic pressure) that takes into account the dispersive nature of the medium. In the case of acoustic propagation through water, the water environment becomes strongly dispersive due to the presence of air bubbles that are present below the air–water interface. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

8248ce806d56227a774b292e0b1ad1d795015356	three-dimensional nonlinear micro/meso-mechanical response of the fibre-reinforced polymer composites		A three-dimensional multi-scale computational homogenisation framework is developed for the prediction of nonlinear micro/meso-mechanical response of the fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites. Two dominant damage mechanisms, i.e. matrix elasto-plastic response and fibre–matrix decohesion are considered and modelled using a non-associative pressure dependent paraboloidal yield criterion and cohesive interface elements respectively. A linear-elastic transversely isotropic material model is used to model yarns/fibres within the representative volume element (RVE). A unified approach is used to impose the RVE boundary conditions, which allows convenient switching between linear displacement, uniform traction and periodic boundary conditions. The computational model is implemented within the framework of the hierarchic finite element, which permits the use of arbitrary orders of approximation. Furthermore, the computational framework is designed to take advantage of distributed memory high-performance computing. The accuracy and performance of the computational framework are demonstrated with a variety of numerical examples, including unidirectional FRP composite, a composite comprising a multi-fibre and multi-layer RVE, with randomly generated fibres, and a single layered plain weave textile composite. Results are validated against the reference experimental/numerical results from the literature. The computational framework is also used to study the effect of matrix and fibre–matrix interfaces properties on the homogenised stress–strain responses. ! 2016 The Authors.

In our previous work [H. Guo and X. Yang, 2016, arXiv:1607.05898], we developed a novel gradient recovery technique for finite element method based on body-fitted mesh. In this paper, we propose new gradient recovery methods for two immersed interface finite element methods: symmetric and consistent immersed finite method [H. Ji, J. Chen and Z. Li, J. Sci. Comput., 61 (2014), 533–557] and Petrov-Galerkin immersed finite element method [T.Y. Hou, X. H. Wu and Y. Zhang, Commun. Math. Sci., 2 (2004), 185–205, and S. Hou and X. D. Liu, J. Comput. Phys., 202 (2005), 411–445]. Compared to bodyfitted mesh based gradient recover methods, immersed finite element methods provide a uniform way of recovering gradient on regular meshes. Numerical examples are presented to confirm the superconvergence of both gradient recovery methods. Moreover, they provide asymptotically exact a posteriori error estimators for both immersed finite element methods.	coefficient;computation;computational science;entity–relationship model;finite element method;galerkin method;gradient;ibm notes;linear interpolation;numerical analysis;numerical method;superconvergence;theory;uc browser;yang	Hailong Guo;Xu Yang	2017	J.

202a0e46aa7a575483d83764e71f4d755bceb1e9	high accuracy mantle convection simulation through modern numerical methods. ii: realistic models and problems		S U M M A R Y Computations have helped elucidate the dynamics of Earth’s mantle for several decades already. The numerical methods that underlie these simulations have greatly evolved within this time span, and today include dynamically changing and adaptively refined meshes, sophisticated and efficient solvers, and parallelization to large clusters of computers. At the same time, many of the methods – discussed in detail in a previous paper in this series – were developed and tested primarily using model problems that lack many of the complexities that are common to the realistic models our community wants to solve today. With several years of experience solving complex and realistic models, we here revisit some of the algorithm designs of the earlier paper and discuss the incorporation of more complex physics. In particular, we re-consider time stepping and mesh refinement algorithms, evaluate approaches to incorporate compressibility, and discuss dealing with strongly varying material coefficients, latent heat, and how to track chemical compositions and heterogeneities. Taken together and implemented in a high-performance, massively parallel code, the techniques discussed in this paper then allow for high resolution, 3-D, compressible, global mantle convection simulations with phase transitions, strongly temperature dependent viscosity and realistic material properties based on mineral physics data.	adaptive mesh refinement;algorithm;coefficient;computation;computer;image resolution;mantle;numerical method;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations;parallel computing;refinement (computing);simulation;stepping level	Timo Heister;Juliane Dannberg;Rene Gassmöller;Wolfgang Bangerth	2011	CoRR	10.1093/gji/ggx195	geophysics;geology;earth science	HPC	94.45772475425244	7.614754459951236	99595

We will deal here with new type of nonlocal boundary value problems that are the solution of hyperbolic partial differential equations with a non-standard boundary specification. The decomposition method of G. Adomian can be an effective scheme to obtain the analytical and approximate solutions. This new approach provides immediate and visible symbolic terms of analytic solution as well as numerical approximate solution to both linear and nonlinear problems without linearization. The Adomian’s method establishes symbolic and approximate solutions by using the decomposition procedure. This technique is useful for obtaining both analytical and numerical approximations of linear and nonlinear differential equations and it is also quite straightforward to write computer code. In comparison to traditional procedures, the seriesbased technique of theAdomian decomposition technique is shown to evaluate solutions accurately and efficiently. The method is very reliable and effective that provides the solution in terms of rapid convergent series. Several examples are tested to support our study.	approximation algorithm;nonlinear system;nonlocal lagrangian;numerical analysis;qr decomposition	Mehdi Dehghan	2004	Int. J. Comput.

fd82654e64f77d41b1375abc83ce7b2a8edb5b86	an adaptive variational procedure for the conservative and positivity preserving allen-cahn phase-field model		In this paper, we present an adaptive variational procedure for unstructured meshes to capture fluid-fluid interfaces in two-phase flows. The two phases are modeled by the phase-field finite element formulation, which involves the conservative Allen-Cahn equation coupled with the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The positivity preserving variational formulation is designed to maintain the bounded and stable solution of the Allen-Cahn equation. For the adaptivity procedure, we consider the residual-based error estimates for the underlying differential equations of the two-phase system. In particular, the adaptive refinement/coarsening is carried out by the newest vertex bisection algorithm by evaluating the residual error indicators based on the error estimates of the Allen-Cahn equation. The coarsening algorithm avoids the storage of the tree data structures for the hierarchical mesh, thus providing the ease of numerical implementation. Furthermore, the proposed nonlinear adaptive partitioned procedure aims at reducing the amount of coarsening while maintaining the convergence properties of the underlying nonlinear coupled differential equations. We investigate the adaptive phase-field finite element scheme through the spinodal decomposition in a complex curved geometry and the volume-conserved interface motion driven by the mean curvature flow for two circles in a square domain. We then assess the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed procedure by modeling the free-surface motion in a sloshing tank. In contrast to the non-adaptive Eulerian grid counterpart, we demonstrate that the mesh adaptivity remarkably reduces the degrees of freedom and the computational cost by nearly half for similar accuracy. The mass loss in the Allen-Cahn equation via adaptivity process is also reduced by nearly three times compared to the non-adaptive mesh. Finally, we apply the adaptive numerical framework to solve the application of a dam-breaking problem with topological changes.		Vaibhav Joshi;Rajeev K. Jaiman	2018	J. Comput.

The proposed method handles linear and nonlinear systems of FredholmVolterra integro-differential equations in a reliable manner. We present a convergence analysis for the proposed method to emphasize its reliability. Numerical examples are examined to show the efficiency and the accuracy of the scheme. We show that a few number of approximating terms gives results of high accuracy level, and by increasing the number of these terms, the error of the approximated solution decreases rapidly. The proposed method is powerful and reliable to solve other kinds of systems of integro-differential equations. Further, it has a small CPU time and its computational time is less than the other methods.	approximation algorithm;central processing unit;computation;nonlinear system;numerical method;semiconductor industry;time complexity	S.

c1af92df77f3629ad7492130e7837b1d03f1f481	a green's function approach for the numerical solution of a class of fractional reaction-diffusion equations	numerical solution;green s function;reaction diffusion equations;anomalous diffusion	Reaction-diffusion equations with spatial fractional derivatives are increasingly used in various science and engineering fields to describe spatial patterns arising from the interaction of chemical or biochemical reactions and anomalous diffusive transport mechanisms. Most numerical schemes to solve fractional reaction-diffusion equations use finite difference schemes based on the Grunwald-Letnikov formula. This work introduces a new systematic approach based on Green's function formulations to obtain numerical schemes for fractional reaction-diffusion equations. The idea is to pose an integral formulation of the equation in terms of the underlying Green's function of the fractional operator to subsequently use numerical quadrature to obtain a set of ordinary differential equations. To illustrate the numerical accuracy of the method, dynamic and steady-state situations are considered and compared with analytical and numerical solutions via Grunwald finite differences schemes. Numerical simulations show that the scheme proposed improves the performance and convergence of traditional finite differences schemes based on Grunwald formula. Numerical solutions of fractional RD systems are given using Green's function formulations.The scheme proposed exhibit global approximation orders of O ( h α ) .Proposed scheme exhibit better numerical approximation than traditional schemes.	numerical partial differential equations	Eliseo Hernandez-Martinez;Francisco J.

7fd3df8194d9f64de5ca2329b16257602d50adea	rational spectral collocation method for pricing american vanilla and butterfly spread options		We present a rational spectral collocation method for pricing American vanilla and butterfly spread options. Due to the early exercise possibilities, free boundary conditions are associated with both of these PDEs. The problem is first reformulated as a variational inequality. Then, by adding a penalty term, the resulting variational inequality is transformed into a nonlinear advection-diffusion-reaction equation on fixed boundaries. This nonlinear PDE is discretised in asset (space) direction by means of rational interpolation using suitable barycentric weights and transformed Chebyshev points. This gives a system of stiff nonlinear ODEs which is then integrated using an implicit fourth-order Lobatto time-integration method. We carried out extensive comparisons with other results obtained by using some existing methods found in literature and observed that our approach is very competitive.	collocation method	Edson Pindza;Kailash C.

However, its success is limited by the poor differentiation between healthy and diseased tissues in the mammogram. A potentially prominent imaging modality is based on the significant difference of x-ray scattering behaviors between tumor and normal tissues. Driven by major practical needs for better x-ray imaging, exploration into contrast mechanisms other than attenuation has been active for decades, e.g., in terms of scattering, which is also known as dark-field tomography. This paper provides a preliminary theoretical study of x-ray dark-field tomography (XDT) assuming the spectral x-ray detection technology. For XDT, the modified Leakeas–Larsen equation (MLLE) is an appropriate approximation of the radiative transfer equation (RTE) for a highly forward-peaked medium with small but sufficient amounts of large-angle scattering. Properties of the MLLE are studied, such as existence of a unique solution and positivity of the solution. MLLE and its discrete analogues can be solved naturally with an iteration procedure, and convergence of the iteration procedure is shown. XDT, as an inverse parameter problem with MLLE as the forward model, is then studied. Numerical discretization schemes of MLLE and the associated XDT are introduced. Simulation results are reported on several numerical examples for MLLE and for XDT. The paper concludes with some remarks on research topics for further study of XDT.	approximation;audio feedback;discretization;iteration;modality (human–computer interaction);numerical analysis;radiography;rendering equation;simulation;tomography	Weimin Han;Joseph A.

This is a scheme that is not well-known within the radiation transport community, but we show that it offers many desirable characteristics relative to other second-order schemes. Several nonlinear variants of the TR/BDF2 scheme are defined and computationally compared with the Crank-Nicholson scheme. It is found for our test problems that the most accurate TR/BDF2 schemes are those that are fully iterated to nonlinear convergence, but the most efficient TR/BDF2 scheme is one based upon a single Newton iteration. It is also shown that neglecting the contributions to the Jacobian matrix from the cross-sections, which is often done due to a lack of smooth interpolations for tabular cross-section data, has a significant impact upon efficiency.

Evaluation of the performance of the least-squares method compared to other weighted residual methods is therefore of interest. Thus, in the present study, numerical techniques in the family of weighted residual methods; the orthogonal collocation, Galerkin, tau, and least-squares methods, have been adopted to solve a non-linear comprehensive and highly coupled pellet problem. The methanol synthesis and the steam methane reforming process have been adopted for this study.#R##N##R##N#Based on the residual of the governing equations, the orthogonal collocation method obtains the same accuracy as the Galerkin and tau methods. Moreover, the orthogonal collocation method is associated with the simplest algebra theory and thus holds the simplest implementation. Another benefit of the orthogonal collocation method is that the technique is more computational efficient than the other methods evaluated. The least-squares method does not obtain the same accuracy as the other weighted residual methods. In particular, the least-squares method is not suitable for strongly diffusion limited systems that give rise to steep gradients in the pellet. On the other side, considering the spectral–element framework, the least-squares method is less sensitive to the placement of the element boundaries than observed for the orthogonal collocation, Galerkin and tau methods.#R##N##R##N#The present paper outlines the algebra of the weighted residual methods and illustrate the numerical solution techniques through a simplified pellet problem.	galerkin method;least squares;orthogonal collocation;web ontology language	Jannike Solsvik;Stian Tangen;Hugo A.

The schemes split the interfacial flux into harmonic and transversal components. Specifically, linear combinations of the transversal vector and the co-normal are used that lead to significant improvements in terms of the mesh-locking effects. The harmonic component of the flux is represented using a conventional monotone two-point flux approximation; the component along the parameterized direction is treated nonlinearly to satisfy either positivity of the solution as in [29], or the discrete maximum principle as in [9]. In order to make the method purely cell-centered, we derive a homogenization function that allows for seamless interpolation in the presence of heterogeneity following a strategy similar to [46]. The performance of the new schemes is compared with existing multi-point flux approximation methods [3] ;  [5]. The robustness of the scheme with respect to the mesh-locking problem is demonstrated using several challenging test cases.	anisotropic diffusion;nonlinear system	Kirill M. Terekhov;Bradley T.

4627c63d72b751f3a492f85b752cc81343d1c6bf	runge-kutta discontinuous galerkin methods for the special relativistic magnetohydrodynamics		This paper develops PK-based non-central and central Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods with WENO limiter for the oneand two-dimensional special relativistic magnetohydrodynamical (RMHD) equations, K = 1, 2, 3. The noncentral DG methods are locally divergence-free, while the central DG are “exactly” divergence-free but have to find two approximate solutions defined on mutually dual meshes. The adaptive WENO limiter first identifies the “troubled” cells by using a modified TVB minmod function, and then uses the WENO technique and the cell average values of the DG solutions in the neighboring cells as well as the original cell averages of the “troubled” cells to locally reconstruct a new polynomial of degree (2K + 1) inside the “troubled” cells instead of the DG solution. The WENO limiting procedure does not destroy the locally or “exactly” divergence-free property of magnetic field and is only employed for finite “troubled” cells so that the computational cost can be as little as possible. Several test problems in one and two dimensions are solved by using our non-central and central Runge-Kutta DG methods with WENO limiter. The numerical results demonstrate that our methods are stable, accurate, and robust in resolving complex wave structures.	approximation algorithm;central processing unit;computation;computational complexity theory;contour line;courant–friedrichs–lewy condition;delay-gradient congestion control;discontinuous galerkin method;flux limiter;muscl scheme;numerical analysis;polynomial;public-key cryptography;relativistic wave equations;runge–kutta methods;xfig	Jian Zhao;Huazhong Tang	2017	J.

The arising Green’s function tensors have low multilinear rank, which allows Tucker decomposition to be employed for their compression, thereby greatly reducing the required memory storage for numerical simulations. Consequently, the compressed components are able to fit inside a graphical processing unit (GPU) on which highly parallelized computations can vastly accelerate the iterative solution of the arising linear system. In addition, the element-wise products throughout the iterative solver’s process require additional flops, thus, we provide a variety of novel and efficient methods that maintain the linear complexity of the classic element-wise product with an additional multiplicative small constant. We demonstrate the utility of our approach via its application to VIE simulations for the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of a human head. For these simulations we report an order of magnitude acceleration over standard techniques.	basis function;computation;emoticon;flops;fast fourier transform;graphical user interface;graphics processing unit;hardware acceleration;iterative method;linear system;low-rank approximation;maxwell (microarchitecture);memory footprint;numerical analysis;parallel computing;polynomial basis;resonance;simulation;solver;tomography;tucker decomposition	Ilias I.

Ming, P. Zhang, and Z. Zhang, Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 204 (2012), pp. 387–444], where we proved that in the regime of weakly transverse long waves, given long-wave initial data, the nondimensionalized water-wave system in an infinite strip under the influence of gravity and surface tension on the upper free interface has a unique solution on [0, T/ε] for some ε independent of constant T. The purpose of this paper is to show that on the same time interval, these solutions can be accurately approximated by sums of solutions of two decoupled Kadomtsev–Petviashvili (KP) equations for the strong and weak surface tension case, when the Bond number is positive and away from 1 3 . In the case when the Bond number α = 1 3 , the coefficients of the third-order dispersion terms in (KP )± equations vanish and the resulting equations become ill-posed. To capture the dispersive nature of the water-wave problem for this parameter regime, we modify the scaling in (1.4) and the approximate equations. In fact, in this case we already proved in [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 204 (2012), pp. 387–444] that a new nondimensionalized water-wave system has a unique solution on [0, T/ε2] for some ε independent of constant T. In this paper, we shall prove that on the same time interval, these solutions are accurately approximated by sums of solutions of two decoupled fifth-order Kadomtsev–Petviashvili (KP 5th)± equations. In particular, we rigorously justify the scenario proved in [G. Schneider and C. E. Wayne, Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 162 (2002), pp. 247–285] for D = 2 to the three-dimensional (3-D) case.	approximation algorithm;bose wave system;coefficient;comstock–needham system;dispersive partial differential equation;gnu arch;image scaling;pixel;transverse wave;well-posed problem	Mei Ming;Ping Zhang;Zhifei Zhang	2012	SIAM J.

For this class of finite element spaces, the geometric shape is n-simplex, the shape function space consists of all polynomials with a degree not greater than m, and the degrees of freedom are given in terms of the integral averages of the normal derivatives of order m − k on all subsimplexes with the dimension n − k for 1 ≤ k ≤ m. This sequence of spaces has some natural inclusion properties as in the corresponding Sobolev spaces in the continuous cases. The finite element spaces constructed in this paper constitute the only class of finite element spaces, whether conforming or nonconforming, that are known and proven to be convergent for the approximation of any 2m-th-order elliptic problems in any Rn, such that n ≥ m ≥ 1. Finite element spaces in this class recover the nonconforming linear elements for Poisson equations (m = 1) and the well-known Morley element for biharmonic equations (m = 2).	approximation;finite element method;polynomial;whole earth 'lectronic link	Ming Wang;Jinchao Xu	2013	Math.

These conditions hold for generic meshes, including unstructured nonconforming heterogeneous meshes of mixed element types, and apply to a large class of linear hyperbolic problems, including the acoustic wave equation, the (an)isotropic elastic wave equations, and Maxwellu0027s equations. The penalty term bounds are computed elementwise, while bounds for the time step size are computed at weighted submeshes requiring only a small number of elements and faces. Numerical results illustrate the sharpness of these bounds.	discontinuous galerkin method	Sjoerd Geevers;Jaap J. W. van der Vegt	2017	SIAM J.

The novel feature of our iterative solver is the incorporation of error control in the natural “energy” norm in combination with an a posteriori estimator for the PDE approximation error. This leads to a robust and optimally efficient stopping criterion: the iteration is terminated as soon as the algebraic error is insignificant compared to the approximation error. We describe a “proof of concept” MATLAB implementation of this algorithm, which we call EST_MINRES, and we illustrate its effectiveness when integrated into the Incompressible Flow Iterative Solution Software (IFISS) package (cf.

It is applicable to either twoor three-dimensional flows, as well as to either static or moving bottom topography. The method is based on the reduction of the problem to a lower-dimensional Hamiltonian system involving boundary quantities alone. A key component of this formulation is the Dirichlet–Neumann operator which, in light of its joint analyticity properties with respect to surface and bottom deformations, is computed using its Taylor series representation. We present new, stabilized forms for the Taylor terms, each of which is efficiently computed by a pseudospectral method using the fast Fourier transform. Physically relevant applications are displayed to illustrate the performance of the method; comparisons with analytical solutions and laboratory experiments are provided.	bathymetry;coefficient;computation;discretization;experiment;fast fourier transform;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);nonlinear system;numerical method;pseudo-spectral method;simulation;spectral method;surface wave;topography	Philippe Guyenne;David P.

a3ae78a749a86b1335762829b3082605e998d1fa	forestclaw: a parallel algorithm for patch-based adaptive mesh refinement on a forest of quadtrees		We describe a parallel, adaptive, multiblock algorithm for explicit integration of time dependent partial differential equations on two-dimensional Cartesian grids. The grid layout we consider consists of a nested hierarchy of fixed size, non-overlapping, logically Cartesian grids stored as leaves in a quadtree. Dynamic grid refinement and parallel partitioning of the grids is done through the use of the highly scalable quadtree/octree library p4est. Because our concept is multiblock, we are able to easily solve on a variety of geometries including the cubed sphere. In this paper, we pay special attention to providing details of the parallel ghost-filling algorithm needed to ensure that both corner and edge ghost regions around each grid hold valid values. We have implemented this algorithm in the ForestClaw code using single-grid solvers from Clawpack, a software package for solving hyperbolic PDEs using finite volumes methods. We show weak and strong scalability results for scalar advection problems on two-dimensional manifold domains on 1 to 64Ki MPI processes, demonstrating neglible regridding overhead.	adaptive multi-rate audio codec;adaptive mesh refinement;cartesian closed category;code;euler;gauss centre for supercomputing;hausdorff dimension;ibm notes;network interface controller;newton;numerical analysis;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations;octree;overhead (computing);parallel algorithm;quadtree;refinement (computing);scalability;stepping level;supercomputer	Donna A.

The solver implicitly eliminates the interior degrees of freedom in each subdomain and solves iteratively the resulting Schur complement, involving only interface displacements, using a BNN preconditioner based on the solution of a coarse elasticity problem and local elasticity problems with natural and essential boundary conditions. While the Schur complement becomes increasingly ill-conditioned as the materials becomes almost incompressible, the BNN preconditioned operator remains well-conditioned. The main theoretical result of the paper shows that the proposed BNN method is scalable and quasi-optimal in the constant coefficient case. This bound holds for material parameters arbitrarily close to the incompressible limit. While this result is due to an underlying mixed formulation of the problem, both the interface problem and the preconditioner are positive definite. Numerical results in two and three dimensions confirm these good convergence properties and the robusteness of the methods with respect to the almost incompressibility of the material.	coefficient;condition number;elasticity (cloud computing);elasticity (data store);numerical method;preconditioner;scalability;solver	Lourenço Beirão da Veiga;Carlo Lovadina;Luca F.

f04e3efe43f02d07219d3f3c7f1d373c8951fd6f	efficient statistically accurate algorithms for the fokker-planck equation in large dimensions		Solving the Fokker-Planck equation for high-dimensional complex turbulent dynamical systems is an important and practical issue. However, most traditional methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality and have difficulties in capturing the fat tailed highly intermittent probability density functions (PDFs) of complex systems in turbulence, neuroscience and excitable media. In this article, efficient statistically accurate algorithms are developed for solving both the transient and the equilibrium solutions of Fokker-Planck equations associated with high-dimensional nonlinear turbulent dynamical systems with conditional Gaussian structures. The algorithms involve a hybrid strategy that requires only a small number of ensembles. Here, a conditional Gaussian mixture in a high-dimensional subspace via an extremely efficient parametric method is combined with a judicious non-parametric Gaussian kernel density estimation in the remaining low-dimensional subspace. Particularly, the parametric method provides closed analytical formulae for determining the conditional Gaussian distributions in the high-dimensional subspace and is therefore computationEmail addresses: chennan@cims.nyu.edu (Nan Chen), jonjon@cims.nyu.edu (Andrew J. Majda) 1Corresponding author Preprint submitted to Journal of Computational Physics July 6, 2017 ally efficient and accurate. The full non-Gaussian PDF of the system is then given by a Gaussian mixture. Different from the traditional particle methods, each conditional Gaussian distribution here covers a significant portion of the high-dimensional PDF. Therefore a small number of ensembles is sufficient to recover the full PDF, which overcomes the curse of dimensionality. Notably, the mixture distribution has a significant skill in capturing the transient behavior with fat tails of the high-dimensional non-Gaussian PDFs, and this facilitates the algorithms in accurately describing the intermittency and extreme events in complex turbulent systems. It is shown in a stringent set of test problems that the method only requires an order of O(100) ensembles to successfully recover the highly non-Gaussian transient PDFs in up to 6 dimensions with only small errors.	algorithm;complex systems;computation;computational physics;curse of dimensionality;dynamical system;entity–relationship model;excitable medium;kernel density estimation;nan;nonlinear system;portable document format;rare events;tails;turbulence	Nan Chen;Andrew J.

After the operation patterns change, the two neighboring modes still share some common correlations; (2) nonlinear reconstruction model is built based on traditional characteristics; and (3) a new fault direction matrix is designed to modify the reconstruction equation. The corresponding confidence regions are constructed according to their models respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been demonstrated via simulated examples. 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The challenge is the discontinuity of the coefficient (interface) which is not necessarily resolved by the underlying finite element mesh. The method is non-conforming in the sense that shape functions preserve continuity across the interface only in an approximative way. However, the construction allows to balance the non-conformity and the overall discretization error. (© 2010 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH u0026 Co.

Bifurcation of eigenvalues along smooth curves in the parameter space is studied. The case of a multiple eigenvalue with the Keldysh chain of arbitrary length is investigated. Explicit expressions describing bifurcation of eigenvalues are found. The obtained formulae use eigenfunctions and associated functions of the adjoint eigenvalue problems as well as the derivatives of the differential operator taken at the initial point of the parameter space. These results are important for the stability theory, sensitivity analysis and structural optimization. As a mechanical application the extended Beck problem of stability of an elastic column subjected to the partially tangential follower force, the Smith–Herrmann problem as well as the problem of flutter instability of a rectangular panel at high Mach numbers are considered and discussed in detail.	approximation;audio system measurements;bifurcation theory;calculus of variations;instability;mathematical optimization;modulus robot;shape optimization;smoothing;wow and flutter measurement	Alexander P.

97b6152217c2e36ead12f4122cd231d508cd4e26	wavelet collocation method for solving multiorder fractional differential equations		The operational matrices of fractional-order integration for the Legendre and Chebyshev wavelets are derived. Block pulse functions and collocation method are employed to derive a general procedure for forming these matrices for both the Legendre and the Chebyshev wavelets. Then numerical methods based on wavelet expansion and these operational matrices are proposed. In this proposed method, by a change of variables, the multiorder fractional differential equations MOFDEs with nonhomogeneous initial conditions are transformed to the MOFDEs with homogeneous initial conditions to obtain suitable numerical solution of these problems. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the applicability and simplicity of the numerical scheme based on the Legendre and Chebyshev wavelets.		M. H.

The numerical solutions obtained by the discretization schemes are compared for five cases of the functional form for the variable diffusivity: (I) constant diffusivity, (II) temporally-dependent diffusivity, (III) spatially-dependent diffusivity, (IV) concentration-dependent diffusivity, and (V) implicitly-defined, temporally- and spatially-dependent diffusivity. Although the schemes have similar agreement to known analytical or semi-analytical solutions in the first four cases, in the fifth case for the variable diffusivity, one scheme produces a stable, physically reasonable solution, while the other diverges. We recommend the adoption of the more accurate and stable of these finite difference discretization schemes to numerically approximate the spatial derivatives of the diffusion equation in spherical coordinates for any functional form of variable diffusivity, especially cases where the diffusivity is a function of position.	approximation algorithm;diffusion;discretization;finite difference;higher-order function;numerical analysis;semiconductor industry	Ashlee N.

We found that for several dissipative and non-equilibrium systems, using the streamfunction as a free variable instead of time separates the general (n+1)×(n+1) system into an n×n auxiliary system and one scalar lifting equation. In numerous cases, where the auxiliary system allows for exact solution, the general flow problem is reduced to numerical or semi-analytical solution of one lifting equation.	flow network;free variables and bound variables;kinetics internet protocol;lagrangian relaxation;lambda lifting;lifting scheme;linear programming relaxation;numerical analysis;parabolic antenna;semiconductor industry;two-phase commit protocol	S.

For transfer coefficients equal to or smaller than one, spiral waves almost identical to those obtained with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions are observed, whereas arms of spiral waves, layers along the boundaries of the domain, break-up, attachment to and detachment from boundaries, islands and complex spatio-temporal patterns result when the transfer coefficients for both the activator and inhibitor are larger than one along either the top and bottom boundaries or the left and right boundaries.When the transfer coefficients are larger than one along all the boundaries of the domain, it has been found that there is a layer of high activator’s concentration along the boundaries and an arm of spiral waves may appear and interact with the boundary layers, and the dynamics of the excitable medium is complex and nonperiodic. 2002 Elsevier Inc.

The two methods are implemented in a unified way which allows for a direct comparison of the non-conforming edge treatment. We outline the implementation details of the non-conforming direct stiffness summation algorithm for the CG method and show that the mass conservation error is similar to the DG method. Both methods conserve to machine precision, regardless of the presence of the non-conforming edges. For lower order polynomials the CG method requires additional stabilization to run for very long simulation times. We addressed this issue by using filters and/or additional artificial viscosity. The mathematical proof of mass conservation for CG with non-conforming meshes is presented in Appendix B.	algorithm;conjugate gradient method;discontinuous galerkin method;finite element method;machine epsilon;polynomial;simulation;stiffness matrix;test case	Michal A.

An analytic study is performed on the basis of improved versions of results published elsewhere, displaying why dynamic methods should be preferred to standard block methods; in particular the empirical observation that the optimal choice of the involved parameter does not significantly vary from one problem to another is theoretically confirmed. It is also explained why, in the case of strong anisotropy, lack of attention when adding diagonal perturbations may result in very poor performance. Rules to surmount this inconvenience are discussed and tested on discretized two-dimensional PDEs.		Mardochée Magolu monga Made	1998	SIAM J.

The error behavior of pressure increment schemes is quite different from the others, as identified by E and Liu [SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 32 (1995), pp. 1017–1057] in their seminal paper on the subject. They later showed that errors in modal solutions had pressure errors of size O(∆t) that oscillated in space with a wavelength of O(∆t), but this behavior was not reproduced in numerical computations. This discrepancy is not resolved in this work. It is shown analytically that for time-periodic solutions, numerical boundary layers of size and width O(∆t) are generated. This is a more suitable framework to consider pressure increment schemes and the results are confirmed in a numerical study in the discrete setting. Computed velocities are second order accurate.	command & conquer:yuri's revenge;computation;comstock–needham system;discrepancy function;discretization;error analysis (mathematics);increment and decrement operators;modal logic;nl (complexity);navier–stokes equations;numerical analysis;numerical aperture;operational amplifier;thickness (graph theory)	Brian T.

Analytical analysis reveals that the velocity of propagation of the shear waves depends upon the direction of propagation, the anisotropy, gravity field, non-homogeneity of the medium, and the initial stress. The frequency equation that determines the velocity of the shear wave has been obtained. The dispersion equations have been obtained and investigated for different cases. A comparison is made with the results predicted by Abd-Alla et al. [22] in the absence of initial stress and gravity field. The results obtained are discussed and presented graphically. In recent years, more attention has been given to using the anisotropic material in engineering applications in considerable research activity. The problem of shear waves in an orthotropic elastic medium is very important for the possibility of its extensive application in various branches of science and technology, particularly in optics, earthquake science, acoustics, geophysics and plasma physics. Shear waves propagating over the surface of homogeneous and non-homogeneous elastic half-spaces are a well-known and prominent feature of wave theory. Mahmoud [1] studied the wave propagation in cylindrical poroelastic dry bones and Abd-Alla and Farhan [2] investigated the effect of inhomogeneity on the composite infinite cylinder of orthotropic material. Abd-Alla and Farhan [2] and Abd-Alla and Mahmoud [3] solved the magneto-thermoelastic problem in rotating a non-homogeneous orthotropic hollow cylindrical under the hyperbolic heat conduction model, and investigated the effect of the rotation on propagation of thermoelastic waves in a non-homogeneous infinite cylinder of isotropic material. Abd-Alla et al. [5] presented Rayleigh wave in a magnetoelastic half-space of orthotropic material under influence of initial stress and gravity field. The shear waves in acoustic anisotropic media have been discussed by Grechka et al. [6]. Many authors such as Abd-Alla and Ahmed [7,10] and El-Naggar et al. [11] studied the effect of gravity on the propagation of Rayleigh waves on elastic solid medium. Ahmed [8] studied Rayleigh waves in a thermoelastic granular medium under initial stress. The influence of gravity on the propagation of waves in granular medium is discussed by Ahmed [9]. Das et al. [12] studied the influence of gravity on surface waves in a non-homogeneous isotropic elastic medium.

There are two popular choices for partition of unity: a piecewise linear FEM mesh and the Shepard-type partition of unity. However, the FEM mesh partition of unity (PU) leads to the singular(or nearly singular) matrices and non-smooth approximation functions. The Shepard-type partition of unity requires lengthy computing time and its implementation are very complex. In order to alleviate these difficulties, Oh et al. introduced the smooth piecewise polynomial PU functions with flat-top, that lead to small matrix condition numbers, and almost everywhere partition of unity, that can handle essential boundary conditions. Nevertheless, we could not have the smooth closed form PU functions with flat-top for general polygonal patches (2D) and general polyhedral patches (3D). In this paper, we introduce one of the most simple and efficient partition of unity, called the (generalized) product partition of unity. The product PU functions constructed by this method are the closed form smooth piecewise polynomials with flat-top and could handle background meshes (general polygonal patches as well as general polyhedral patches) arising in practical applications of meshless methods. ∗Corresponding author.

First, we investigate fine estimates of the discrete Green’s function and its positivity. We establish that in two dimensions on a smooth domain the discrete Green’s function with singularity in the interior of the domain must be strictly positive throughout the computational domain once the mesh is sufficiently refined. We also establish novel pointwise error estimates for the discrete Green’s function that are valid up to the boundary of the domain. Then, using these estimates we establish a discrete Harnack inequality for piecewise linear discrete harmonic functions. In contrast to the discrete maximum principle the result is valid for general quasi-uniform shape regular meshes except for a condition on the layer near the boundary. Such results may prove to be useful for the analysis of discrete solutions of fully nonlinear problems.	computation;finite element method;graph coloring;negative feedback;nonlinear system;parabolic antenna;piecewise linear continuation;polygon mesh;singularity project;social inequality;technological singularity	Dmitriy Leykekhman;Michael Pruitt	2017	Math.

The method is based on the symmetric multistep method of Quinlan–Tremaine, with eight steps and eighth algebraic order and is constructed to solve numerically the radial time-independent Schrodinger equation during the resonance problem with the use of the Woods–Saxon potential. It can also be used to integrate related IVPs with oscillating solutions such as orbital problems. We compare the new method to some recently constructed optimized methods from the literature. We measure the efficiency of the methods and conclude that the new method with infinite order of phase-lag is the most efficient of all the compared methods and for all the problems solved.	kerrison predictor;numerical partial differential equations;predictor–corrector method;radial (radio);schrödinger	G.

4687d2bc73edde11a6d7ca68101dd8adf483412c	solution of the wave-type pde by numerical damping control multistep methods☆	linear multistep methods	Abstract   The second order Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) system obtained after semidiscretizing the wave-type partial differential equation (PDE) with the finite element method (FEM) shows strong numerical stiffness. Its resolution requires the use of numerical methods with good stability properties and controlled numerical dissipation in the high-frequency range. The HHT- α  and BDF- α  methods are second order precision, unconditionally stable and able to dissipate high-modes for some values of the parameters. The finite element method has been applied to the one-dimensional linear wave-type PDE and to a non-linear version of a string of a guitar. The ODE systems obtained after applying FEM are solved by these two methods, proving that both are able to dissipate the high-modes.		E. Alberdi Celaya;J. J.

We study three different forms of the governing equations using seven test cases. Three test cases involve flow over mountains which require the implementation of non-reflecting boundary conditions, while one test requires viscous terms (density current). Including viscous stresses into finite difference, finite element, or spectral element models poses no additional challenges; however, including these terms to either finite volume or discontinuous Galerkin models requires the introduction of additional machinery because these methods were originally designed for first-order operators. We use the local discontinuous Galerkin method to overcome this obstacle. The seven test cases show that all of our models yield good results. The main conclusion is that equation set 1 (non-conservation form) does not perform as well as sets 2 and 3 (conservation forms). For the density current (viscous), the SE and DG models using set 3 (mass and total energy) give less dissipative results than the other equation sets; based on these results we recommend set 3 for the development of future multiscale research codes. In addition, the fact that set 3 conserves both mass and energy up to machine precision motives us to pursue this equation set for the development of future mesoscale models. For the bubble and mountain tests, the DG models performed better. Based on these results and due to its conservation properties we recommend the DG method. In the worst case scenario, the DG models are 50% slower than the non-conservative SE models. In the best case scenario, the DG models are just as efficient as the conservative SE models.

The basic idea of the test is to probe some region in space with waves which are small on some test domain and, thus, do not generate a response when the scatterer is inside of this test domain. We will prove that the No Response Test checks analytic continuability of a time-harmonic field from the far field pattern into the domain Be := R3 \B for a non-vibrating test domain B. We show that two incident waves, defined by one incident direction and two appropriately chosen directions of polarization, are enough to recover the convex hull of polyhedrals. Based on this uniqueness result, we build up the No Response Test and we prove convergence in the sense that it fully reconstructs a convex polyhedral scatterer D or the convex hull of an arbitrary polyhedral scatterer. Further, we will describe the algorithmical realization of the No Response Test and show the feasibility of the method by reconstruction of convex polyhedral objects in three dimensions. This is the first formulation of the No Response Test for electromagnetics.	convex hull;norm (social);numerical analysis;polarization (waves);polyhedron;radiation pattern	Roland Potthast;Mourad Sini	2010	J.

Each phase is assumed to be isentropic with its own sonic speed. The components are gamma-law gases with γ > 1. For such the computational challenge at a junction is the computation of rarefaction waves which do not have a readily available analytical form. Firstly, the well-posedness of the Riemann problem at the junction is discussed. It is suggested that rarefaction waves should be linearized inorder to obtain a more efficient numerical method for coupling such multi-component flow. Some computational results on the dynamics of the multi-phase gas in the pipes demonstrate the qualitative behaviour of this approach.	computation;numerical method;pipeline (unix);riemann problem;subsonic;tree traversal;well-posed problem;whole earth 'lectronic link	Mapundi K.

The flow starting from rest is driven by a constant pressure gradient in an infinite long straight pipe. By employing the method of variable separations and Heaviside operational calculus, we obtain the exact solution, from which the flow characteristics are investigated. It is found that the start-up motion of a fractional Maxwell's fluid with parameters @a and @b, tends to be at rest as time goes to infinity, except the case of @b=1. This observation, which also can be predicted from the mechanics analogue of fractional Maxwell's model, agrees with the classical work of Friedrich and it indicates that a fractional Maxwell's fluid presents solid-like behavior if @b 1 and fluid-like behavior if @b=1. For an arbitrary viscoelastic model, a conjecture is proposed to give an intuitive way judging whether it presents fluid-like or solid-like behavior. Also oscillations may occur before the fluid tends to the asymptotic behavior stated above, which is a common phenomenon for viscoelastic fluids.	maxwell (microarchitecture)	Di Yang;Ke-Qin Zhu	2010	Computers & Mathematics with Applications	10.1016/j.camwa.2010.08.013	classical mechanics;pipe flow;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;asymptotic analysis;calculus;mathematics;thermodynamics;oscillation;quantum mechanics;pressure gradient	Theory	87.85765406642868	5.611181565927209	105681

As one result of this collaboration, the general-purpose Versatile Advection Codemonstrated excellent scaling properties across a variety of shared and distributed memory architectures. VAC uses various shock capturing numerical methods with explicit, semi-implicit, or fully implicit time stepping, on 1, 2, or 3 dimensional nite volume grids. Porta-bility to diierent hardware platforms is achieved by preprocessors that can translate the code from Fortran 90 both forwards to High Performance Fortran and backwards to Fortran 77. With this code, we simulate complicated magnetized plasma phenomena where simultaneous large-scale and small-scale structures evolve on diierent timescales. We investigate fundamental hydromagnetic instabilities in multi-dimensional, fully non-linear regimes, as well as astrophysically oriented applications. An overview of recently investigated phenomena includes: the role of the magnetic eld in Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, stellar wind models and solar coronal mass ejections, and accretion ows onto compact objects (black holes).	algorithm;distributed memory;dynamical system;general-purpose modeling;high performance fortran;nonlinear system;numerical method;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations;parallel computing;plasma active;porta-color;preprocessor;rayleigh–ritz method;semiconductor industry;shock capturing method;simulation;stellar (payment network);stellar wind;stepping level;vacuum cleaner	Rony Keppens;Gábor Tóth;J.

An analytic first-order atmospheric drag theory is developed using Lagrange’s planetary equations. The short periodic perturbations due to the geopotential of all orbital elements are evaluated. And to construct a second-order analytical theory, the equations of motion become very complicated to be integrated analytically; thus we are forced to integrate them numerically using the method of Runge-Kutta of fourth order. The validity of the theory is checked on the already decayed Indian satellite ROHINI where its data are available.	approximation algorithm;first-order predicate;first-order reduction;molecular orbital;numerical analysis;planetary scanner;runge–kutta methods;semiconductor industry;time complexity	Sobhy E.

In this paper we suggest a way for deriving asymptotic expansions to the limit cycle solutions due to a Hopf bifurcation in two-dimensional reaction systems and we use them to build convenient normal modes for the analysis of Turing instabilities of the limit cycle. They extend the Fourier modes for the steady state in the classical Turing approach, as they include time-periodic fluctuations induced by the limit cycle. Diffusive instabilities can be properly considered because of the non-catastrophic loss of stability that the steady state shows while the limit cycle appears. Moreover, we shall see that instabilities may appear even though the diffusion coefficients are equal. The obtained normal modes suggest that there are two possible ways, one weak and the other strong, in which the limit cycle generates oscillatory Turing instabilities near a Turing–Hopf bifurcation point. In the first case slight oscillations superpose over a dominant steady inhomogeneous pattern. In the second, the unstable modes show an intermittent switching between complementary spatial patterns, producing the effect known as twinkling patterns. Communicated by P.K. Maini. M.R.

It has been analyzed making use of the usual techniques for hyperbolic differential equations. Here we consider a related but different problem, the problem determined by the dynamic deformations of porouselasticity with porous dissipation when the motion of the microvoids is supposed to be quasi-static. We think that this kind of dynamical problem deserves some consideration. However, little attention has been paid to them in the literature. On the one hand, the problem has interest from a mechanical point of view, because this is the system that one must study when the microvoids deformations are small enough as to assume that their acceleration is nearly zero. On the other hand, the problem has also interest from its mathematical structure, because the coupling of a parabolic equation with an hyperbolic one arises in the system.	dynamic problem (algorithms);dynamical system;elasticity (cloud computing);mathematical structure;parabolic antenna;point of view (computer hardware company)	Antonio Magaña;Ramón Quintanilla	2006	Mathematical and Computer Modelling	10.1016/j.mcm.2006.02.007	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;applied mathematics;calculus;void;mathematical model;mathematics;elasticity;differential equation;quantum mechanics	Theory	87.523754515323	6.025236534740904	106372
9e523ed40dc27f61eb75eadbe201ab27368bdf40	numerical coarsening using discontinuous shape functions		In this paper, an efficient and scalable approach for simulating inhomogeneous and non-linear elastic objects is introduced. Our numerical coarsening approach consists in optimizing non-conforming and matrix-valued shape functions to allow for predictive simulation of heterogeneous materials with non-linear constitutive laws even on coarse grids, thus saving orders of magnitude in computational time compared to traditional finite element computations. The set of local shape functions over coarse elements is carefully tailored in a preprocessing step to balance geometric continuity and local material stiffness. In particular, we do not impose continuity of our material-aware shape functions between neighboring elements to significantly reduce the fictitious numerical stiffness that conforming bases induce; however, we enforce crucial geometric and physical properties such as partition of unity and exact reproduction of representative fine displacements to eschew the use of discontinuous Galerkin methods. We demonstrate that we can simulate, with no parameter tuning, inhomogeneous and non-linear materials significantly better than previous approaches that traditionally try to homogenize the constitutive model instead.

The schemes are based on the use of more precise information about the local speeds of propagation and can be viewed as a generalization of the schemes from [A. Kurganov and E. Tadmor, J. Comput. Phys., 160 (2000), pp. 241–282; A. Kurganov and D. Levy, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 22 (2000), pp. 1461–1488; A. Kurganov and G. Petrova, A third-order semidiscrete genuinely multidimensional central scheme for hyperbolic conservation laws and related problems, Numer. Math., to appear] and [A. Kurganov and E. Tadmor, J. Comput. Phys., 160 (2000), pp. 720–742]. The main advantages of the proposed central schemes are the high resolution, due to the smaller amount of the numerical dissipation, and the simplicity. There are no Riemann solvers and characteristic decomposition involved, and this makes them a universal tool for a wide variety of applications. At the same time, the developed schemes have an upwind nature, since they respect the directions of wave propagation by measuring the one-sided local speeds. This is why we call them central-upwind schemes. The constructed schemes are applied to various problems, such as the Euler equations of gas dynamics, the Hamilton–Jacobi equations with convex and nonconvex Hamiltonians, and the incompressible Euler and Navier–Stokes equations. The incompressibility condition in the latter equations allows us to treat them both in their conservative and transport form. We apply to these problems the central-upwind schemes, developed separately for each of them, and compute the corresponding numerical solutions.	euler;godunov's scheme;image resolution;jacobi method;navier–stokes equations;numerical analysis;powerbook 160;software propagation;upwind scheme	Alexander Kurganov;Sebastian Noelle;Guergana Petrova	2001	SIAM J.

The robustness for changing operating conditions, numerical stability in long-term transient behaviour and the pressure-term consideration are generally the main concerns of the Galerkin Reduced-Order Models (ROM). In this article, we present a novel procedure to construct an off-reference solution state by using an interpolated POD reduced basis. A linear interpolation of the POD reduced basis is performed by using two reference solution states. The POD basis functions are optimal in capturing the averaged flow energy. The energy dominant POD modes and corresponding base flow are interpolated according to the change in operating parameter. The solution state is readily built without performing the Galerkin projection of the Navier-Stokes equations on the reduced POD space modes as well as the following time-integration of the resulted Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) to obtain the POD time coefficients. The proposed interpolation based approach is thus immune from the numerical issues associated with a standard POD-Galerkin ROM. In addition, a posteriori error estimate and a stability analysis of the obtained ROM solution are formulated.

It is assumed that uncertainties in the flow system arise due to the heterogeneities of the porous medium. Methods of stochastic mechanics are adopted to offer a novel approach, whereby the absolute permeability is taken as a spatial stochastic process with a log-normal distribution at each point of the flow domain. A correlation structure is built into the model so as to achieve a realistic representation. In addition, a constraint on the invariance of the harmonic means of the random permeabilities is attained by way of topological scaling. A computer-synthesized waterflooding experiment is conducted to explore the effect of heterogeneity on output variables such as the oil pressure head and cumulative recovery. It is observed that output uncertainties can become significant even when the heterogeneities are small. By employing a least-squares procedure, the sensitivity of relative permeabilities to induced stochastic variations is also qualitatively investigated.	heart rate variability;image scaling;least squares;monte carlo method;simulation;stochastic process;two-phase locking	F.

The schemes are based on a method of lines approach combining discontinuous Galerkin spatial discretization with single- or multi-step methods in time. The construction of the estimators requires a reconstruction in time for which we present a very general framework first for ODEs and then applying the approach to conservation laws. The reconstruction does not depend on the actual method used for evolving the solution in time. Most importantly, in addition to implicit methods it also covers the wide range of explicit methods typically used to solve conservation laws. For the spatial discretization, we allow for standard choices of numerical fluxes. We use reconstructions of the discrete solution together with the relative entropy stability framework, which leads to error control in the case of smooth solutions.

So, for fourth-order elliptic problems conforming finite element methods (FEMs) require (C^1-)continuity, which usually leads to complicated implementation [1]. This drawback could be surmounted by using nonconforming methods. These FEMs have been widely applied in computational engineering and structural mechanics.	finite element method	Andrey B.

A system of functional equations called generalized Wiener-Hopf equations (GWHE) is obtained. Only for certain values of the aperture angle these equations are recognizable as standard or classical Wiener-Hopf equations (CWHE). However, in all cases, a mapping to a suitable complex plane reduces the generalized Wiener-Hopf equations to classical Wiener-Hopf equations. It means that the diffraction by an impenetrable wedge always reduces to a standard Wiener-Hopf factorization. The explicit solution for the diffraction by a two-face impedance wedge having arbitrary aperture angle may be given by direct factorization methods.	characteristic impedance;navier–stokes equations	V.

In particular for colliding solid objects it is desirable to allow large deformations and relative slide, whilst employing fixed grids and maintaining sharp interfaces. Existing schemes utilising interface tracking methods such as volume-of-fluid typically introduce erroneous transport of tangential momentum across material boundaries. Aside from combatting these difficulties one can also make improvements in a numerical scheme for multiple compressible solids by utilising governing models that facilitate application of high-order shock capturing methods developed for hydrodynamics. A numerical scheme that simultaneously allows for sliding boundaries and utilises such high-order shock capturing methods has not yet been demonstrated. A scheme is proposed here that directly addresses these challenges by extending a ghost cell method for gas-dynamics to solid mechanics, by using a first-order model for elastic materials in conservative form. Interface interactions are captured using the solution of a multi-material Riemann problem which is derived in detail. Several different boundary conditions are considered including solid/solid and solid/vacuum contact problems. Interfaces are tracked using level-set functions. The underlying single material numerical method includes a characteristic based Riemann solver and high-order WENO reconstruction. Numerical solutions of example multi-material problems are provided in comparison to exact solutions for the one-dimensional augmented system, and for a two-dimensional friction experiment.	elasticity (data store);euler method;lagrangian and eulerian specification of the flow field;nonlinear system	Philip T.

Two examples of annular-like domains are studied. The results and performance are compared with those of the well-known boundary element method (BEM). The high accuracy of the EDEM solutions and the superior efficiency of the EDEM over the BEM, make EDEM an excellent alternate candidate to use in the animation industry, where speed is a predominant requirement, and by the scientific community where accuracy is the paramount objective.	numerical method	J.

More precisely, we do investigate in detail a dissipative, nonlinear Schrödinger equation somehow accounting for quantum Fokker–Planck effects, and how it is drastically reduced to a simpler logarithmic equation via a nonlinear gauge transformation in such a way that the physics underlying both problems keeps unaltered. From a mathematical viewpoint, this allows for a more achievable analysis regarding the local wellposedness of the initial–boundary value problem. This simplification requires the performance of the polar (modulus–argument) decomposition of the wavefunction, which is rigorously attained (for the first time to the best of our knowledge) under quite reasonable assumptions.	level of detail;logarithmic schrödinger equation;modulus of continuity;nonlinear system;quantum dissipation;schrödinger picture	Pilar Guerrero;Jose-Luis Lopez;Jesús Montejo-Gámez;Juanjo Nieto	2012	J.

We propose a regularization method for solving this ill-posed problem via a multiscale collocation method with multiple regularization parameters corresponding to the multiple scales. Many highly nonlinear problems such as flight data analysis demand identifying the system of a high order. This task requires huge computational costs due to processing a dense matrix of a large order. To overcome this difficulty a compression strategy is introduced to approximate the full matrix resulted in collocation of the Volterra kernel by an appropriate sparse matrix. A numerical quadrature strategy is designed to efficiently compute the entries of the compressed matrix. Finally, numerical results of three simulation experiments are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. Communicated by Juan Manuel Peña.

The proposed method is a revision of the existing normalized weighting factor (NWF) method and henceforth, it is termed as revised normalized weighting factor (RNWF) method. Unlike the previous method which is penta-diagonal in nature, the RNWF method generates tri-diagonal system of linear equations and is expected to be computationally inexpensive and robust to use. This method relies on the normalized weighting factors for its formulation in which implicit terms are formed based on the contribution of neighbouring grid points and explicit source terms are formed based on the contribution of far-off grid points of the control volume. Moreover, proper NWF are proposed for the downwind line of the Normalized Variable Diagram (NVD).

The existence of traveling-wave solutions for the equation under consideration is a well-known fact. Some of such solutions are positive, bounded from above, and monotone in both space and time. Motivated by these facts, we propose an explicit, nonlinear, finite-difference methodology to approximate consistently the solutions of the model under investigation. In the linear regime, the method is consistent of first order in time and of second order in space. Under certain, flexible parameter conditions, the method is capable of preserving the positivity, the boundedness, and the spatial and the temporal monotonicity of the traveling-wave solutions. Moreover, we establish analytically and numerically that the nonlinear method is conditionally stable. A computational implementation of our technique shows that the method preserves in practice the mathematical features of interest of the exact solutions considered.	approximation algorithm;computation;finite difference method;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical stability;population dynamics;population model;monotone	Jorge Eduardo Macías-Díaz;K.

The challenge was to get certain quantities of interest in terms of the approximate solutions within 5% of accuracy of their exact counterparts. For instance, the goal could be to evaluate the bending moment or the shear force at the junction of the shell and the ring. The purpose of the present paper is to solve an axisymmetric solid elastic model for this problem using a continuous finite element method in combination with discontinuous interface elements in the region of interest (named as the DG-FEM method). The numerical results of the   p     p        version of the DG-FEM method are presented and discussed. The results are verified with respect to previous results published in the literature showing excellent consistent results.	discontinuous galerkin method;finite element method	Philippe R. B.

Mathematically, we prove the necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for the optimal control problem. Computationally, we establish a scheme to approximate the optimality system through the discretization by the upwind finite volume element method for the physical space, and by the sparse grid stochastic collocation algorithm based on the Smolyak construction for the probability space, which leads to the discrete solution of uncoupled deterministic problems. Moreover, the existence and uniqueness of the discrete solution are given. A priori error estimates are derived for the state, the co-state and the control variables. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate our theoretical results.	collocation;finite volume method;optimal control;sparse grid	Liang Ge;Lianhai Wang;Yanzhen Chang	2018	J. Sci.

Based on this idea, we consider four different approaches for regularizing ill-posed linear operator equations. Convergence in the noise free case as well as-with an appropriate a priori truncation rule-in the situation of noisy data is analyzed. Moreover, we propose an a posteriori truncation rule and characterize its convergence. Numerical tests illustrate the theoretical results. Both analysis and computations suggest one of the four variants to be favorable to the others.	cholesky decomposition	Barbara Kaltenbacher	2007	J.

The main result is that the energy norm of the finite element approximate error is, up to some extra oscillation term, equivalent to an appropriate hierarchical estimator. The proof is based upon some new observations on efficiency and some technical tools deriving from a previous work (Zou et al. in Numer. Math. 117:653– 677,2011). Moreover, we present an equivalence between the energy norm and the energy functional of the finite element approximate error. Several numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings.	approximation algorithm;experiment;finite element method;numerical analysis;turing completeness	Qingsong Zou	2013	J. Sci.

b0e3f57aa6d2a20014a93b475ef273e4c9362edb	space-time generalized riemann problem solvers of order k for linear advection with unrestricted time step		This work concerns high-order approximations of the linear advection equation in very long time. A GRP-type scheme of arbitrary high-order in space and time with no restriction on the time step is developed. In the usual GRP solvers, we consider a polynomial approximation of the solution in space in each cell at the initial time. Here, we add a second polynomial approximation of the solution in time in each interface. Thanks to this double approximation, the resulting scheme is compact. It is proved to be of order k+1 in space and time, where k is the degree of the polynomials. Thanks to the compactness of the scheme, a two-dimensional extension is detailed on unstructured meshes made of triangles. Several numerical test-cases and comparison with existing methods illustrate the excellent behaviour of the scheme.	riemann problem	Christophe Berthon;Céline Sarazin;Rodolphe Turpault	2013	J. Sci.

5114cf7f7593d04e3c5ced551228e3fe744794a5	superconvergence of quadratic finite volume method on triangular meshes		Abstract This paper is concerned with the superconvergence properties of the quadratic finite volume method (FVM) on triangular meshes for elliptic equations. We proved the 3rd order superconvergence rate of the gradient approximation ‖ u h − u I ‖ 1 = O ( h 3 ) and the 4th order superconvergence rate of the function value approximation ‖ u h − u I ‖ 0 = O ( h 4 ) for the quadratic FVM on triangular meshes. Here u h is the FVM solution and u I is the piecewise quadratic Lagrange interpolation of the exact solution. It should be pointed out that the superconvergence phenomena of FVM strongly depends on the construction of dual mesh. Specially for quadratic FVMs, the scheme presented in this paper is the unique scheme which holds superconvergence.		Xiang Wang;Yonghai Li	2019	J.

This statistical snake expands until its elements encounter pixels that lie outside user-defined limits relative to a seed region; when these limits are violated the pressure force is reversed to make the model contract. Tension and stiffness forces keep the boundary of the region model smooth, and a repulsion force prevents self-intersection. Boundary elements can be added and removed in response to complexity changes, and the tension, stiffness and pressure parameters can be adjusted to preserve the energy balance of the changing model. Statistical snakes have been used to segment a variety of images including composite textures and NMR data volumes.	pixel;region growing	James P.

f9dfa659536320787bdfec1b15a26d73ee571f8a	incompressible réthy flows in two dimensions		This paper deals with the mathematical theory of a two-dimensional incompressible flow with two free boundaries effusing from a semi-infinite nozzle around a given obstacle, which is named the Rethy flows. The interesting and old problem was suggested and tried by M. Rethy in 1895 for a flow around a symmetric wedge. Here, we are concerned with the well-posedness theory of the symmetric Rethy flow with more general geometric conditions to the nozzle and obstacle. Given a mass flux at the inlet of the nozzle, we established the existence of the incompressible symmetric Rethy flows, containing two free boundaries behind the obstacle. Furthermore, the location estimate, the deflection angle estimate of the Rethy flow in the far field, and the asymptotic behavior of the Rethy flow in the upstream and downstream are also obtained. Finally, some results on the uniqueness of the Rethy flow are established.		Jianfeng Cheng;Lili Du;Wei Xiang	2017	SIAM J. Math.

b4b362c8b2620850e9b2a5e7cb20b32784efb715	two-component domain decomposition scheme with overlapping subdomains for parabolic equations		An iteration-free method of domain decomposition is considered for approximate solving a boundary value problem for a second-order parabolic equation. A standard approach to constructing domain decomposition schemes is based on a partition of unity for the domain under the consideration. Here a new general approach is proposed for constructing domain decomposition schemes with overlapping subdomains based on indicator functions of subdomains. The basic peculiarity of this method is connected with a representation of the problem operator as the sum of two operators, which are constructed for two separate subdomains with the subtraction of the operator that is associated with the intersection of the subdomains. There is developed a two-component factorized scheme, which can be treated as a generalization of the standard Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) schemes to the case of a special three-component splitting. There are obtained conditions for the unconditional stability of regionally additive schemes constructed using indicator functions of subdomains. Numerical results are presented for a model two-dimensional problem.	alternating direction implicit method;approximation algorithm;computation;domain decomposition methods;finite element method;iteration;numerical linear algebra;numerical method;parabolic antenna;utility functions on indivisible goods	Petr N.
