Few multispectral remote sensing approaches have quantitatively resolved the spatial complexity of photosynthetic vegetation (PV), nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV), and bare soil in drylands. In combination, these surface properties provide insight to land degradation and desertification known to be occurring in many drylands worldwide. Given sufficient spatial resolution and sensor performance, imaging spectroscopy provides this information using reflectance measurements over the 0.4–2.5m region. We tested and compared the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) and the spaceborne Earth Observing 1 Hyperion imaging spectrometer for measuring PV, NPV, and bare soil fractional cover in the Monte Desert biome of Central Argentina. A probabilistic spectral mixture model was used to decompose image pixels into subpixel surface constituents using a spectral endmember bundling approach. AVIRIS (4.5-m pixels) and Hyperion (30-m pixels) data were collected over a 763-km2 region containing the Nacunan Man-and-Biosphere Reserve and surrounding unprotected areas. The AVIRIS data, combined with the mixture modeling, provided highly accurate estimates of PV, NPV, and bare soil in comparison with field measurements (0 83 2 0 86). Hyperion provided accurate estimates of PV ( 2 = 0 68) due to good red-edge (0.69–0.71 m) performance, but NPV and bare soil estimates were accurate only when cover values exceeded 30% ( 2 = 0 39–0 40). Lower NPV and soil cover accuracies from Hyperion were due to lower S/N performance in the shortwave-infrared (2.0–2.4 m) region. Convolving the AVIRIS reflectance data to 30-m pixel size showed that apparent accuracies decrease by 20% due to field/remote sensing colocation errors. AVIRIS 30-m results for PV were statistically similar to Hyperion 30-m results. Convolving the Hyperion data to 60-m pixel size boosted S/N performance but did not significantly increase the accuracy of mixture analyses. Both AVIRIS and Hyperion spectral mixture results consistently showed much lower NPV and higher bare soil cover outside the Nacunan Reserve. PV cover fractions indicated land degradation in localized areas near cattle ranching centers outside the reserve. The PV+NPV results indicated spatially discrete and widespread degradation of ecosystems that are not protected in Nacunan Reserve. High-fidelity airborne instruments such as AVIRIS perform exceptionally well in these studies, while moderate-fidelity Manuscript received May 28, 2002; revised January 7, 2003.

A temporal backscatter model for a finite duration of transmitted signal is used to estimate the values of four sediment parameters through inversion-mean grain size, roughness spectrum strength, roughness spectrum exponent, and sediment volume scattering parameter. Ground truth information on sediment mean grain sizes at these locations is obtained from the laboratory analysis of grab samples. Applicability of the temporal backscatter model over different sediment compositions at 33 and 210 kHz is investigated here for characterizing the seafloor through inversion. Moreover, a combined two-frequency inversion approach has been attempted for improved characterization by estimating a single set of values for the aforementioned four sediment parameters, which is applicable to the backscatter data at both of the acoustic frequencies. A linear regression analysis demonstrates that the estimated values of sediment mean grain size obtained from these three inversion cases statistically agree with the ground truth data. In addition, correlations of the estimated values of seafloor roughness spectrum parameters with the values of sediment mean grain size are compared with published information available in the literature.	acoustic cryptanalysis;backscatter (email);embedded system;experiment;frequency band;ground truth;incidence matrix;inversion (discrete mathematics);köppen climate classification;marginal model;photogrammetry;quantum fluctuation;single-frequency network	Chanchal De;Bishwajit Chakraborty	2011	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2011.2139218	inversion;spectrum;geology;hydrology;geotechnical engineering;sediment;optics;backscatter;physics;grain size;remote sensing	Visualization	84.7083192283199	-62.284301286250795	42111

This paper explains a technique to retrieve these two parameters from satellite images utilizing three bands of visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared for better estimation of mitigation potential. The technique assumes linear mixture model with variable end member approach in which end member spectra of vegetation and non-vegetation targets are varied continuously by representing these spectra as a function of leaf area index and soil brightness, respectively. A numerical algorithm is examplained to unmix the variable endmember LMM. The proposed technique was applied to the data acquired by LANDSAT7-ETM+ to discuss its validity on retrievals of the two biophysical parameters.	algorithm;computer cooling;mixture model;numerical analysis;pixel	Kenta Obata;Hiroki Yoshioka;Hirokazu Yamamoto	2008	IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4780138	meteorology;image retrieval;hydrology;urban heat island;physics;statistics;remote sensing	Vision	84.66648327884975	-62.146067779624	42324

K-means cluster analysis is employed to calculate the planting structure of main grain crops in Heilongjiang Province. It is indicated that with the climate warming, the paddy planting area has enlarged rapidly, and its northern planting boundary has been extended to 52° N, and been pushed towards the east. The borderline of corn advanced to the north, at the meantime the planting area of wheat has deduced remarkably and its planting area retreated northward. Thus the adjustment of structure results in the rice has become the most important grain instead of wheat, and the planting structure has been changed from wheat and corn dominate to the corn and rice dominate in the past 20 years, especially in 1990s. All these changes had related to the increasing of accumulative temperature in response to the global warming. © 2005 IEEE.

It is assumed that a cloud field is optically thick. Thus, only overcast cloud fields are under consideration. The study is based on the independent column approximation, assuming Gamma distribution of cloud optical thickness (COT) in the cloud field under study. This paper confirms all essential findings of cloud optics, concerning the influence of horizontally inhomogeneous clouds on transmitted, reflected, and absorbed solar light. For instance, we found the decrease of light reflection and absorption (negative biases) and the increase of light transmission (positive biases) for inhomogeneous clouds as compared to the case of a homogeneous cloud field with the value of optical thickness equal to that of an average COT of an inhomogeneous cloud field. Analytical equations for biases of radiative characteristics (e.g., the reflection function, spherical albedo, transmittance, and absorptance) are derived. Also, for the first time, we established the relationships between biases of different radiative characteristics. Analytical equations proposed are simple and highly accurate for optically thick weakly absorbing cloud fields. They can be incorporated in large-scale atmospheric models for the simplification of radiation blocks both for homogeneous and inhomogeneous cloud fields in visible and near-infrared spectral regions.	approximation;asymptote;cloud computing;level of detail;thickness (graph theory)	Alexander A.

The cloud liquid water was retrieved by using AMSR-E 89 GHz temperature brightness. Then the atmospheric effects were computed on X band which was used to retrieve soil moisture. Because of the cloud effect, the surface temperature can not be reliably estimated using infrared satellite data, we have used an algorithm to minimize the effect of surface temperature on soil moisture retrievals. Then the retrieved soil moisture was validated by the experimental data in CEOP. The results indicated that the retrieval of soil moisture was indeed impacted by atmospheric non-precipitation cloud though the effect was very small in the study area.	algorithm;ceop	Yongqian Wang;Bangsen Tian;Jiancheng Shi;James R.

0bfed3be0340bf37504759f6913e73e11605f8d7	effect of orbital shadow at an earth-moon lagrange point on relay communication mission		The shadow effect is an important constraint to be considered during the implementation of exploration missions. In this paper, for the Earth-Moon Lagrange point L2 relay communication mission, shadow effect issues on a periodic orbit about L2 are investigated. A systematic analysis based on the time domain and phase space is performed including the distribution, duration, and frequency of shadows. First, the Lindstedt-Poincare and second-order differential correction methods are used in conjunction with the DE421 planetary ephemeris to achieve a mission trajectory family in a high-precision ephemeris model. Next, on the basis of a conical shadow model, the influence of different orbital phases and amplitudes on the shadow is analyzed. The distribution of the shadow is investigated as well. Finally, the configuration of the shadow and its characteristics are studied. This study provides an important reference and basis for mission orbit design and shadow avoidance for relay satellites at an Earth-Moon Lagrange point.	communications satellite;molecular orbital;moon;orbital magnetization;planetary scanner;poincaré–steklov operator;relay;shadow volume;time series	Yuhua Tang;Weiren Wu;Dong Qiao;Xiangyu Li	2016	Science China Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-016-9069-9	ephemeris;orbit;mathematics;mathematical optimization;geodesy;satellite;phase space;time domain;trajectory;lagrangian point;shadow	Visualization	84.0403496554598	-70.0019613818533	42518
f170993f17396081bc2cfde712d7d361b9d4b20d	polywatt: a polynomial water travel time estimator based on derivative dynamic time warping and perceptually important points		Abstract Traditional methods for estimating timing parameters in hydrological science require a rigorous study of the relations of flow resistance, slope, flow regime, watershed size, water velocity, and other local variables. These studies are mostly based on empirical observations, where the timing parameter is estimated using empirically derived formulas. The application of these studies to other locations is not always direct. The locations in which equations are used should have comparable characteristics to the locations from which such equations have been derived. To overcome this barrier, in this work, we developed a data-driven approach to estimate timing parameters such as travel time. Our proposal estimates timing parameters using historical data of the location without the need of adapting or using empirical formulas from other locations. The proposal only uses one variable measured at two different locations on the same river (for instance, two river-level measurements, one upstream and the other downstream on the same river). The recorded data from each location generates two time series. Our method aligns these two time series using derivative dynamic time warping ( DDTW ) and perceptually important points ( PIP ). Using data from timing parameters, a polynomial function generalizes the data by inducing a polynomial water travel time estimator, called PolyWaTT . To evaluate the potential of our proposal, we applied PolyWaTT to three different watersheds: a floodplain ecosystem located in the part of Brazil known as Pantanal, the worldu0027s largest tropical wetland area; and the Missouri River and the Pearl River, in United States of America. We compared our proposal with empirical formulas and a data-driven state-of-the-art method. The experimental results demonstrate that PolyWaTT showed a lower mean absolute error than all other methods tested in this study, and for longer distances the mean absolute error achieved by PolyWaTT is three times smaller than empirical formulas.	dynamic time warping;polynomial	Yuri Navarro Claure;Edson Takashi Matsubara;Carlos Padovani;Ronaldo C.

9c5dfd46735158520b86654d74e62b4b8b5220c7	a spatial calibration method for satellite-derived precipitation estimates over china		Improving the accuracy of satellite-derived precipitation estimates is very important to extend the extent and depth of their application. Existing calibration methods calibrated satellite-derived precipitation estimates based on a strong relationship between gauge measurements and estimated precipitation. However, such a relationship is always disturbed by variation of land surface characteristics, elevation or climate types. Existing methods always assume the study area as homogeneous and seldom consider its spatial heterogeneity. This study proposed a spatial calibration method for the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B43 precipitation data, assuming that the relationships between gauge measurements and satellite-derived precipitation estimates vary spatially. These relationships were further explored using geographical weighted regression; consequently the derived relationships were used to construct a spatial calibration model. The monthly, seasonal, and annual precipitation data over Mainland China in 2011 was used as an example. The experiment results show that the proposed method can produce calibrated results accurately, with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values of 0.72–0.91, 0.83–0.93, and 0.92 for monthly, seasonal, and annual precipitation, respectively. Furthermore, compared with the calibration methods based on regression analysis (RA) and geographical difference analysis (GDA), the proposed method increases NSE values by 1–12% and 0 −16%, respectively, and reduces root mean square error values by 1.7–26.4% and 1.8–36.4%, respectively.	algorithmic efficiency;gnome-db;mean squared error;nash equilibrium;network search engine;spatial network;traffic collision avoidance system	Fengrui Chen;Yushi Zhou;Wenting Wang	2017	2017 25th International Conference on Geoinformatics	10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2017.8090917	remote sensing;elevation;regression analysis;calibration;computer science;precipitation;unit-weighted regression;homogeneous;spatial heterogeneity;mean squared error	Robotics	85.35400303877415	-59.90895593306908	42918

The present study was conducted to estimate the geographic distribution of Artemisia sieberi ( A. sieberi ) and Artemisia aucheri ( A. aucheri ), find the most important environmental predictor variables and seek for similarities and differences in habitat preferences between the two species for Poshtkouh rangelands in Central Iran. Maps of environmental variables were created by means of geographic information system (GIS) and geostatistics. Then predictive distribution maps of both species were produced using the maximum entropy modeling technique (Maxent) and presence-only data. Model accuracy is evaluated by using the area under the curve (AUC). Lime1, gravel1, lime 2 and elevation most significantly affect habitat distribution of A. aucheri , while habitat distribution of A. sieberi is affected by elevation, lime1, am1, lime2, and om2. For both species, elevation has an influence on their potential distributions. However, A. aucheri depends more on elevation, and consequently climate in comparison to A. sieberi . Finally, it is revealed that the potential distribution of A. aucheri is limited mostly to mountainous landscapes while A. sieberi is present in wide ranges of environmental conditions.	habitat;principle of maximum entropy	S.

Existing models for the HMTF utilized in remote sensing are based on approximations derived from consideration of conservation of wave action. However the accuracy of these approximations has been quantified only through comparison with experimental data; in such comparisons, numerous empirical models for terms such as wind forcing and breaking wave dissipation are required that make direct evaluation of the hydrodynamic effects difficult. A method for providing direct insight into the hydrodynamic modulation of short sea waves by longer waves is described in this paper, through use of numerical non-linear hydrodynamic codes for sea surface evolution. A Monte Carlo simulation process based on a stochastic spectrum of short waves propagating over a single deterministic long wave is described, including the data analysis techniques developed to extract a numerical HMTF from the simulated surfaces. HMTF values obtained from the simulations are compared to those from a first order wave action solution, and found to be in reasonable agreement."""	approximation;code;computer simulation;delta modulation;monte carlo method;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;transfer function	Guangdong Pan;Joel T.

73b6bdcead6dc28d0ba7a5fe8b7e68514dbc6dbe	experimental study of the thermal infrared emissivity variation of loaded rock and its significance		Previous studies have shown that thermal infrared radiation (TIR) changes with stress for loaded rocks. TIR changes were mainly attributed to temperature change without considering the change in surface emissivity. And it remains unclear whether there was a change in emissivity during the rock loading process. Therefore, based on the spectral radiance observations in this paper, an experimental study involving the emissivity variation in the 8.0–13.0 μm range for elastic loaded quartz sandstone under outdoor conditions was conducted. The experiments yield the following results. First, a variation in the stress condition led to the emissivity change in addition to the temperature change. The spectral radiance change was the combined result of the temperature changes and emissivity changes. Second, the emissivity changes linearly with the stress change, and the amplitude is relatively large in the 8.0–10.0 μm range. The waveband features of emissivity variation are the main factor leading to the waveband features of stress-induced radiance change. Third, the explanations for the changes in temperature and emissivity during loading process are analyzed.

Because of the geometry of the acquisition process, measurements are irregularly sampled, whereas in meteorological applications, data are preferred on a regular grid. This problem is further complicated by the fact that, due to CubeSats’ compact sizes and constraints, such as limited power, errors occur in geolocation calibration, resulting in positional errors. In this letter, we analyze how the commonly used triangulation-based linear data interpolation scheme behaves under probabilistic models for the positional errors. The derived distribution of interpolation error caused by positional error is intractable even under a Gaussian distribution for positional errors. To address this problem, we developed an analytical closed-form solution to the first two moments of the interpolation error. Using models for positional errors motivated by our prior work, experimental results show that, compared with the first-order linear model, the second-order one provides a better approximation in terms of the mean and variance, which is very close to that is obtained using more computationally intensive Monte Carlo simulations. This model also allows for the closed-form calculation of mean squared interpolation error, which can be of use in the context of system design where the impact of positional errors on remote sensing products must be considered.	approximation;first-order logic;first-order predicate;geolocation;interpolation;linear model;monte carlo method;probabilistic analysis of algorithms;regular grid;simulation;systems design	Weitong Ruan;Adam B.

In order to assimilate microwave brightness temperatures (Tbs) at horizontal polarization (h-pol), an SM capable of resolving melt-refreeze crusts is required. To date, it has not been shown whether an RA scheme is tractable with the large number of state variables present in such an SM or whether melt-refreeze crust densities can be estimated. In this paper, an RA scheme is presented using the CROCUS SM which is capable of resolving melt-refreeze crusts. We assimilated both vertical (v) and horizontal (h) Tbs at 18.7 and 36.5 GHz. We found that assimilating Tb at both h-pol and vertical polarization (v-pol) into CROCUS dramatically improved snow depth estimates, with a bias of 1.4 cm compared to -7.3 cm reported by previous studies. Assimilation of both h-pol and v-pol led to more accurate results than assimilation of v-pol alone. The snow water equivalent (SWE) bias of the RA scheme was 0.4 cm, while the bias of the SWE estimated by an empirical retrieval algorithm was -2.9 cm. Characterization of melt-refreeze crusts via an RA scheme is demonstrated here for the first time; the RA scheme correctly identified the location of melt-refreeze crusts observed in situ.	algorithm;cobham's thesis;data assimilation;emoticon;microwave;polarization (waves);snow;traffic collision avoidance system	Ally M.

The accuracy of this method is demonstrated using reflection data collected from a unique wideband (10-1000 MHz) permittivity probe specifically designed for quick in situ permittivity measurements of soils at different depths. The improved calibration method is based on the traditional capacitance model, which suffers from errors caused by the assumption that the capacitance is independent of the frequency and the permittivity of the ambient medium under test. The improved capacitance model is introduced here to account for the frequency- and permittivity-dependent effects. Thus, it produces more accurate permittivity estimation over a much wider frequency and permittivity ranges. This letter will discuss about the accuracy of this improved permittivity probe calibration method and a wideband in situ soil probe design.	experiment;simulation;time-domain reflectometer	Ming Chen;Chi-Chih Chen	2013	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2012.2205366	calibration;relative permittivity;reflection coefficient;capacitance;optics;physics;permittivity	EDA	84.86899462962808	-65.4762588093382	44162
8b39ab77c8aca160f13a1cfc4d52eaa890c7812b	assessment of errors caused by forest vegetation structure in airborne lidar-derived dtms		Airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is a survey tool with many applications in forestry and forest research. It can capture the 3D structure of vegetation and topography quickly and accurately over thousands of hectares of forest. However, very few studies have assessed how accurately LiDAR can measure surface topography under forest canopies, which may be important, for example, in relation to analysis of preand post-burn surface height maps used to quantify the combustion of organic soils. Here, we use ground survey equipment to assess digital terrain model (DTM) accuracy in a deciduous broadleaf forest, during both leaf-on and leaf-off conditions. Using the leaf-on LiDAR dataset we quantitatively assess vertical vegetation structure, and use this as a categorical explanatory variable for DTM accuracy. In the presence of leaf-on vegetation, DTM accuracy is severely reduced, with low-stature undergrowth vegetation (such as ferns) causing the greatest errors (RMSE > 1 m). Errors are lower under leaf-off conditions (RMSE = 0.22 m), but still of a magnitude similar to that reported for mean depths of burn in fires involving organic soils. We highlight the need for adequate ground control schemes to accompany any forest-based airborne LiDAR survey which require highly accurate DTMs.	airborne ranger;burn-in;digital elevation model;human height;map;motorola canopy;national lidar dataset;point cloud;topography	Jake E.

The altimetry bias in the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) or other laser altimeters resulting from atmospheric multiple scattering is studied in relationship to current knowledge of cloud properties over the Antarctic Plateau. Estimates of seasonal and interannual changes in the bias are presented. Results show the bias in altitude from multiple scattering in clouds would be a significant error source without correction. The selective use of low-optical-depth clouds or cloud-free observations, as well as improved analysis of the return pulse such as by the Gaussian method used here, is necessary to minimize the surface altitude errors. The magnitude of the bias is affected by variations in cloud height, cloud effective particle size, and optical depth. Interannual variations in these properties as well as in cloud cover fraction could lead to significant year-to-year variations in the altitude bias. Although cloud-free observations reduce biases in surface elevation measurements from space, over Antarctica these may often include near-surface blowing snow, also a source of scattering-induced delay. With careful selection and analysis of data, laser altimetry specifications can be met.		Ashwin Mahesh;James D. Spinhirne;David P. Duda;Edwin W. Eloranta	2002	IEEE Trans.

A large rainfall dataset that is derived from an operational C-band dual-polarized radar, which is placed in S. Pietro Capoflume near Bologna (Italy), has been collected and analyzed for this purpose. Different models of convective rainy horizontal structures are described and compared. Special attention is devoted to the consolidated unimodal models (or unimodal patterns) like Gaucell with a Gaussian rain-rate profile and Excell with an exponential rain-rate profile, and the hybrid models like Hycell and Dexcell based on a proper combination of the previous unimodal models. The new hybrid model Dexell, which is introduced here, is an extension of the Hycell model, which is previously proposed in literature. A pixel-by-pixel model numerical integration is carried out in order to perform a homogeneous comparison between the rain-cell model and the measured features such as peak, average, root mean square, gradient average, and gradient deviation of rain rate. A maximum-likelihood algorithm, which is expressed in terms of the principal component of the previous rain-cell features, is introduced to estimate rain-cell pattern parameters from the available radar data. A detailed sensitivity analysis, which is devoted to find the best behavior in terms of root-mean-square error and correlation coefficient between the modeled and measured rain-cell features, is finally carried out.	algorithm;cell (microprocessor);coefficient;gradient;mean squared error;numerical analysis;numerical integration;pixel;principal component analysis;radar;time complexity	Mario Montopoli;Frank S.

This paper presents a simulation study to investigate whether spaceborne submillimeter radiometric observations, which can be realized with fairly high spatial resolution, are able to derive the vertical structure of the atmospheric wet delay. The accuracy of the retrieved zenith wet delay (ZWD) trend as a function of surface height is assessed in order to correct the associated height dependence of the interferometric phase error in a SAR interferogram. Using a simulated benchmark, we evaluate the errors associated with the use of both a linear and an exponential model of the behavior of ZWD as a function of the surface height. This paper shows a fairly accurate reconstruction of the trend parameters estimated from radiometer brightness temperature images, with respect to realistic atmospheric profiles provided by radiosounding observations (RAOBs). The trend parameters that we consider in this paper are the slope K for the linear model and scale height H for the exponential one. An overall better accuracy is found for the exponential model, which is more representative of the actual behavior of ZWD with height, resulting in a residual uncertainty in the path delay due to the atmospheric stratification of approximately 0.2-0.3 cm and nearly zero bias, as compared to RAOBs.	aperture (software);benchmark (computing);linear model;microwave;simulation;spectral slope;synthetic data;time complexity	Patrizia Basili;Stefania Bonafoni;Piero Ciotti;Nazzareno Pierdicca	2014	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2013.2250292	meteorology;atmospheric sciences;water vapor;physics;remote sensing	Visualization	84.21341656735827	-63.121408020406086	44666

Abstract Most Multiple Flow Direction algorithms (MFD) use a flow partition coefficient (exponent) to determine the fractions draining to all downslope neighbors. The commonly used MFD often employs a fixed exponent over an entire watershed. The fixed coefficient strategy cannot effectively model the impact of local terrain conditions on the dispersion of local flow. This paper addresses this problem based on the idea that dispersion of local flow varies over space due to the spatial variation of local terrain conditions. Thus the flow partition exponent of a MFD should also vary over space. We present an adaptive approach for determining the flow partition exponent based on local topographic attribute which controls local flow partitioning. In our approach, the influence of local terrain on flow partition is modeled by a flow partition function which is based on local maximum downslope gradient (we refer to this approach as MFD based on maximum downslope gradient, MFD-md for short). With this new approach, a steep terrain which conduces a convergent flow condition, can be modeled using a large value for the flow partition exponent. Similarly, a gentle terrain can be modeled using a small value for the flow partition exponent. MFD-md is quantitatively evaluated using four types of mathematical surfaces and their theoretical 'true' value of Specific Catchment Area (SCA). The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) shows that the error of SCA computed by MFD-md is lower than that of SCA computed by the widely used SFD and MFD algorithms. Application of the new approach using a real DEM of a watershed in Northeast China shows that the flow accumulation computed by MFD-md is better adapted to terrain conditions 5 based on visual judgement.	algorithm;coefficient;gradient;hannan–quinn information criterion;hurst exponent;maxima and minima;mean squared error;merkle–damgård construction;partition function (mathematics);precomputation;routing;topography;tree accumulation;usability;watershed (image processing);mdadm	Chengzhi Qin;A-Xing Zhu;Tao Pei;Baoluo Li;Chenghu Zhou;Lechang Yang	2007	International Journal of Geographical Information Science	10.1080/13658810601073240	digital elevation model;geography;geographic information system;cartography;statistics;remote sensing	Graphics	86.34044362196295	-59.02583533675752	44681

222f4e126f73553dc3c4d43d2d9d77ca10d696ad	assessing resource-use efficiency of land use		Abstract We introduce an explicit indicator and the Land Use Management Support System to assess the resource-use efficiency of land use (RUE) at the landscape scale. To estimate RUE, we relate land-use performance with regard to ecosystem services indicators to the maximum possible land-use performance based on an optimised land-use configuration. The test application of the RUE assessment in the Haean catchment, South Korea, shows that the land-use systemu0027s RUE could be increased by 11% for both nitrate and sediment loss. The estimated headroom could indicate whether potential contaminant reduction targets for the downstream water reservoir Lake Soyang could be achieved with the current land-use system. The recurring RUE assessment for a given region might indicate the effectiveness of spatial planning and policy measures to improve the RUE in that region. Future work should address the integration of RUE into a participatory spatial planning or resource-management framework.		Alexander Herzig;Trung Thanh Nguyen;Anne-Gaelle E.

3130486dd5d5b36affef8db5b395fa9621d21a3b	impact of projected emission and climate changes on air quality in the u.s.: from national to state level		Abstract Future ambient air quality will respond to changes in anthropogenic and biogenic emissions as well as climate changes, which may vary at national and state levels in different regions of the world. In this work, we applied an advanced online-coupled meteorology and chemistry model, the Weather Research and Forecasting Model with Chemistry (WRF/Chem), to the continental U.S. for current (2001-2010) and future (2046-2055) decades under four climate scenarios including the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 and the Technology Driver Model (TDM) A1B and B2. Our goal is to quantify the impact of projected changes in anthropogenic and biogenic emissions and climate on future air quality under various climate scenarios for policy analysis for emission control and mitigation of adverse climate change. The simulations are performed at 36-, 12-km, and 4-km over North America, Continental U.S., and selected states, respectively. A comprehensive evaluation has been performed for the current simulation period using available observations from surface networks and satellites and shows an overall good performance in reproducing climatic and chemical observations at all grid scales. Future air quality features greater reduction in PM 2.5 by RCP 4.5/8.5 than TDM B2/A1B and decreased O 3 over most areas in the U.S. by RCP4.5 and TDM B2, indicating the benefits of carbon policy and technology changes with greater emission reductions. Air quality responds differently to projected changes in anthropogenic emissions in different states and seasons, indicating a need to develop state-specific emission control strategies for different seasons.

In this study, a non-stationary 1982–2012 AVHRR NDVI3g time series, the newest dataset, were used to evaluate spatio-temporal patterns of seasonal vegetation changes in Xinjiang province of China at regional, biome and pixel scales over progressively longer periods from 18 to 31 years, starting in 1982, and their linkages to climatic factors and human activities were analyzed. At regional scale, the increases were statistically significant for autumn NDVI during fourteen periods, for growing season and summer NDVI during the most periods, and for spring only during the first four periods. The rates of NDVI increase in growing season and all seasons significantly decreased over fourteen periods. At pixel scale, areas with significant browning rapidly increased over fourteen periods for growing season and all seasons, and these areas were mainly concentrated in northern desert of Xinjiang. Vegetation growth in Xinjiang was regulated by both moisture and thermal conditions: the response of NDVI in spring and autumn was more sensitive to thermal factors, such as temperature and potential evapotranspiration, and correlations between NDVI and precipitation and between NDVI and humidity index were stronger in summer and growing season. Extensive use of fertilizers and expanded farmland irrigated area increased vegetation growth for cropland. However, the rapid increase in the proportion of cotton cultivation and use of drip irrigation may reduce spring NDVI in the part of farmlands. Trend analysis during the multiple nested time series may contribute to a better and deep understanding of NDVI dynamic and foreseeing changes in the future. Accordingly, NDVI in Xinjiang will continuously increase at regional scale and the areas showing significant browning will also furthermore grow.

Whilst airborne LiDAR data are in general very dense but only available over small areas due to the cost of their acquisition, spaceborne LiDAR data acquired from the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) have a coarser acquisition density associated with a global cover. It is therefore valuable to analyze the integration relevance of canopy heights estimated from LiDAR sensors with ancillary data such as geological, meteorological, and phenological variables in order to propose a forest canopy height map with good precision and high spatial resolution. In this study, canopy heights extracted from both airborne and spaceborne LiDAR, were first extrapolated from available environmental data. The estimated canopy height maps using random forest (RF) regression from the airborne or GLAS calibration datasets showed similar precisions (RMSE better than 6.5 m). In order to improve the precision of the canopy height estimates regression-kriging (kriging of RF regression residuals) was used. Results indicated an improvement in the RMSE (decrease from 6.5 to 4.2 m) for the regression-kriging maps from the GLAS dataset, and from 5.8 to 1.8 m for the regression-kriging map from the airborne LiDAR dataset.	airborne ranger;autocorrelation;emoticon;extrapolation;heightmap;kerrison predictor;kriging;linux/rk;map;motorola canopy;polarimetry;rf modulator;radio frequency;random forest;relevance;sensor;shuttle radar topography mission;spatial analysis;star height;surround sound;time series;tomography;while	Ibrahim Fayad;Nicolas Baghdadi;Jean-Stéphane Bailly;Nicolas Barbier;Valéry Gond;Bruno Hérault;Mahmoud El Hajj;Jeremie Lochard;José Perrin	2015	2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326729	meteorology;lidar;geology;hydrology;signal processing;physics;remote sensing	Robotics	84.80104249145737	-60.40056905328801	45566

16d55e4b542352babeedaf0170d08c182baef84a	gis application on arsenic contamination and its risk assessment in ronphibun, nakhorn si thammarat, thailand	arsenic contamination;hot spot;drinking water;risk assessment;arsenic;correlation analysis	This paper presents a case study of GIs application on arsenic contamination and its toxicological effects in a tin mining area of southern Thailand. A GIs database was constructed which depicted the arsenic distribution profiles in different environmental media, i.e. the shallow groundwater, deep groundwater and near-surface soil. Estimation from the GIs interpolation showed that 72.3 1% of the study area had arsenic level higher than 0.05mgL (Thailand standard) in shallow groundwater. The contamination situation in deep groundwater was more severe than shallow groundwater. Six major contamination sources were identified through correlation analysis between arsenic level in soiYgroundwater sample sites with the distance to mining and waste dumping sites. The correlation between arsenism patients’ distribution with arsenic concentration and other geological features were analyzed, the results showed a significant difference between the groundwater arsenic concentration inside and outside the distribution zone of arsenism patients. With the help of GIs, arsenic hot spots in each media were displayed. Arsenic risk assessment was also conducted in four villages based on the arsenic exposure from drinking water, which found that village 12 had the highest risk due to arsenic consumption.	geographic information system;interpolation;risk assessment;triangulated irregular network	Jianjun Zhang;Xiaoyong Chen;Preeda Parkpian;Monthip Sriratana Tabucanon;Skorn Mongkolsuk	2001	Annals of GIS	10.1080/10824000109480557	arsenic;risk assessment;mining engineering;computer science;arsenic contamination of groundwater;hot spot	HCI	84.44069863986279	-55.63632917048555	45690

The Li-Strahler geometric-optical model treats a vegetation canopy as an assemblage of partially illuminated tree crowns of spheroidal shape, and through geometric optics and Boolean set theory, models the proportion of sunlit or shadowed canopy and background as functions of view angle, illumination angle, and crown geometry. The model has been modified to accommodate a sloping surface in its computation of bidirectional and hemispherical reflectance. When the BRDF of a flat vegetated surface is compared to the BRDF of a sloping surface that is similarly vegetated, the interaction of the illumination angle and the slope distort the shape of the BRDF. A hemispherical integration of this distorted BRDF provides an albedo for the sloping surface. >	motorola canopy;topography	Crystal Schaaf;Xiaowen Li;Alan H. Strahler	1994	IEEE Trans.

This study considers the aspect of spatial and temporal vegetation variability in the state of Paraíba. A ten year time period of the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) from MODIS satellite data with a high temporal resolution (16 days) and medium spatial resolution (250 m) was analyzed. In addition, a ten year EVI time series with monthly time intervals and 1 km spatial resolution was correlated with a precipitation time series. Vegetation in Paraíba is characterized by a high variability of greenness on the intra-annual and inter-annual level as well as on the spatial dimension. The highest correlation between EVI and precipitation is achieved for a time lag of 1 month (regional R= 0.64).	elegant degradation;spatial variability;time series	Anne Schucknecht;Jörg Matschullat;Stefan Erasmi	2012	2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6351643	enhanced vegetation index;radiometry;normalized difference vegetation index;hydrology;physics;vegetation;seasonality;remote sensing	DB	83.59374974209851	-57.41674166432957	47190
c8d62edc38268dce8d8c0a0ec056a676893475a4	landsat 8 image-based analysis of the urban heat island characteristics in jinan, china		With the acceleration of urbanization and industrialization, the urban heat island (URI) effect, which has raised increasing concern. The goal of this study was to make a detailed analysis of the genesis of the Jinan urban heat island, which may be used to reduce surface temperatures in the city of Jinan. Using the Landsat OLI/TIRS acquired on July 11, 2014 and September 2, 2016, the land surface temperatures (LST) for Jinan city of China were retrieved. The urban biophysical descriptors, including the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) and impervious surface area (ISA) were retrieved, and the relationship between LST and urban biophysical properties was further studied. The results showed that LST in the built-up area of Jinan city were higher than in the adjacent suburbs, and the urban heat island effect was significant. Additionally, LST were negatively correlated to the indices MNDWI and SAVI but positively correlated to the index ISA. These results could provide useful guidelines for the city of Jinan city urban construction and urban planning	genesis;inverted index;uniform resource identifier	Fei Meng;Qingfeng Xiao	2018	IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8517305	thermal pollution;remote sensing;impervious surface;china;computer science;urban heat island;vegetation index;urbanization;urban planning	HCI	84.36489496944438	-59.2656844057827	47236

The retrieval approach inverts a forward model for radar scattering from a bare surface using a pre-computed lookup-table representation of σ0 obtained from Numerical Maxwell Model in 3D simulations. The retrieval process assumes that surface roughness properties are constant during the time series interval, so that only a single rms height estimate is produced for the entire time series. A study using measured data having 6 to 11 time-steps shows an rms error of 0.044 cm3/cm3 for soil moisture with a correlation coefficient of 0.89 between retrieved and in-situ data. Surface rms height estimates are also found accurate to 10 to 30% of in-situ measurements. It is also shown that retrieval performance is not sensitive to errors in knowledge of the surface roughness correlation length for most of the bare surface conditions examined.	algorithm;coefficient;lookup table;maxwell (microarchitecture);numerical linear algebra;precomputation;radar;simulation;time series;verification and validation	Seung-Bum Kim;Shaowu Huang;Leung Tsang;Joel T.

However, due to the high workload and cost of a measuring campaign on a full-scale WWTP, many simulation studies suffer from lack of sufficiently long influent flow rate and concentration time series representing realistic wastewater influent dynamics. In this paper, a simple phenomenological modelling approach is proposed as an alternative to generate dynamic influent pollutant disturbance scenarios. The presented set of models is constructed following the principles of parsimony (limiting the number of parameters as much as possible), transparency (using parameters with physical meaning where possible) and flexibility (easily extendable to other applications where long dynamic influent time series are needed). The proposed approach is sub-divided in four main model blocks: 1) model block for flow rate generation, 2) model block for pollutants generation (carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus), 3) model block for temperature generation and 4) model block for transport of water and pollutants. The paper is illustrated with the results obtained during the development of the dynamic influent of the Benchmark Simulation Model no. 2 (BSM2). The series of simulations show that it is possible to generate a dry weather influent describing diurnal flow rate dynamics (low rate at night, high rate during day time), weekend effects (with different flow rate during weekends, compared to weekdays), holiday effects (where the wastewater production is assumed to be different for a number of weeks) and seasonal effects (with variations in the infiltration and thus also the flow rate to the WWTP). In addition, the dry weather model can be extended with a rain and storm weather generator, where the proposed phenomenological model can also mimic the “first flush” effect from the sewer network and the influent dilution phenomena that are typically observed at full-scale WWTPs following a rain event. Finally, the extension of the sewer system can be incorporated in the influent dynamics as well: the larger the simulated sewer network, the smoother the simulated diurnal flow rate and concentration variations. In the discussion, it is pointed out how the proposed phenomenological models can be expanded to other applications, for example to represent heavy metal or organic micro-pollutant loads entering the	allocate-on-flush;benchmark (computing);extensibility;full scale;maximum parsimony (phylogenetics);numerical weather prediction;occam's razor;phenomenological model;sampling (signal processing);simulation;time series	Krist V.

06a2859eb92caa2dc4a5d5de4b2913f8cf5ab91e	assessment on the impact of arable land protection policies in a rapidly developing region	urbanization;geographic information system;arable land protection;landscape analysis	To investigate the effect of arable land protection policies in China, a practical framework that integrates geographic information systems (GIS), soil quality assessment and landscape metrics analysis was employed to track and analyze arable land transformations and landscape changes in response to rampant urbanization within the Ningbo region (China) from 2005 to 2013. The results showed that arable land loss and degradation have continued, despite the development of a comprehensive legal framework for arable land protection. The implementation of arable land protection policies is judged to be effective, but not entirely successful, because it guarantees the overall amount of arable land but does not consider soil quality and spatial distribution. In addition, there are distinct variations in arable land change dynamics between two temporal intervals. From 2005–2009, the transformation of arable land was diversified, with intensified conversion among arable land, built-up land, water and orchards. Moreover, many new arable land parcels were adjacent to built-up land, and are in danger of being occupied again through urban sprawl. By 2009–2013, most of the arable land was occupied by urban expansion, whereas a majority of newly increased arable land was reclaimed from coastal tideland. Although the newly increased arable land was contiguous and far from the urban area, it is of poor quality and has limited use. The permanent loss of high-quality arable land due to intensified urban sprawl may threaten sustainable development and food security on a larger scale.	elegant degradation;geographic information system;software metric	Jiadan Li;Zhongchu Zhang;Li-gang Ma;Qing Gu;Ke Wang;Zhihao Xu	2016	ISPRS Int.

Surface albedos measured on ground (Fig. 5, 6) were transformed to effective DASI at-sensor radiance values using an atmospheric model (MODTRAN) together with radiosonde measurements. Comparison with DASI at-sensor radiance (adjusted with a spectrally independent multiplier) is shown in Fig. 8. This multiplier was applied to DASI laboratory calibration to compensate for radiance scale errors caused by in-flight malfunction of the adjustable entrance aperture. Surface reflectance values for all regions were derived from adjusted DASI at-sensor radiance measurements using the above model (Fig. 9).

8b9b5904b4e2ad617b8eb43847be4e4159a20ad7	estimating live fuel moisture in southern california using remote sensing vegetation water content proxies		Wildfires are a major ecological disturbance in Southern California and often lead to great destruction along the Wildland-Urban Interface. Live fuel moisture has been used as an important indicator of wildfire risk in measurements of vegetation water content. However, the limited field measurements of live fuel moisture in both time and space have affected the accuracy of wildfire risk estimations. Traditional estimation of live fuel moisture using remote sensing data was based on vegetation indices, indirect proxies of vegetation water content and subject to influence from weather conditions. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of estimating live fuel moisture using vegetation indices, Soil Moisture Active Passive L-band soil moisture data and the modeled vegetation water content using a non-linear model based on VIs and the stem factor associated with remote sensing moisture data products. The stem factor describes the peak amount of water residing in stems of plants and varies by land cover. We also compared the outcomes from regression models and recurrent neural network using the same independent variables. We found the modeled vegetation water content outperformed vegetation indices and the L-band soil moisture observations, suggesting a nonlinear relationship between live fuel moisture and the remotely sensed vegetation signatures. We discuss our results which will improve the predictability of live fuel moisture.	antivirus software;artificial neural network;l band;linear model;nonlinear system;recurrent neural network;visual instruction set	Shenyue Jia;Seung Hee Kim;Son V.

This region has uniform land cover, consisting largely of maize and soybean row crops. The comparison was restricted to periods with no rainfall. There were 19 days available for analysis of the soil moisture product. It was found that there was a significant difference in the soil moisture product for all 19 days, with lower soil moisture for most mornings. The difference between the soil moisture products on some days exceeded the allowable error of 0.04 m3 m-3. In-situ and model results indicate that there should be virtually no change in soil moisture between the evening and morning. In order to investigate this discrepancy, measured brightness temperature was converted to a polarization index (PI), and evening and morning values were compared. Investigation of the measured brightness temperature was limited to five days where a large range in incidence angles was available. Large differences between evening and morning passes were found for incidence angles less than 40° that could not be explained with radiative transfer theory but may be attributed to technical issues. There was also a difference in the PI values between the evening and morning passes for incidence angles greater than 40°. This can be caused by a decrease in soil moisture from evening to morning or could be attributed to an increase in the volumetric water content of the vegetation.	discrepancy function;incidence matrix;polarization (waves)	Tracy L.

b98b6e5b9dd8848a59ff8e2dc2b557fe96ffd622	is there really a closure gap between 183.31-ghz satellite passive microwave and in situ radiosonde water vapor measurements?		We present a new closure study between radiosonde and microwave satellite humidity measurements. The radiosonde data are from the Global Climate Observing System Reference Upper-Air Network. The satellite data are from the radiometers: MHS, Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder, and Sondeur Atmosphérique du Profil d’Humidité Intertropicale par Radiométrie. Like previous studies, we find the satellite data to be “colder” than simulated radiosonde data. But the mean bias value (0.4 K) is smaller than previously reported and, according to our analysis, not significant. The error budget suggests an uncertainty of 0.52–1.06 K. We also show that the improvement in closure can be attributed to improvements in the intercomparison methodology.	microwave;simulation;terabyte;value (computer science)	Oleksandr Bobryshev;Stefan A.

To examine the sensitivity of the radar backscattering to the salinity profile variations, the backscattering from sea ice with a few simulated C-shaped salinity profiles are calculated based on a numerical scattering model. It is found that the radar backscattering is not sensitive to the salinity of sea ice at both C and L bands. The radar wave may penetrate deep into the sea ice, but difficult to sense the variations of the salinity profiles.	numerical analysis;radar	Xu Xu;Camilla Brekke;Anthonin P.

In order to model real world environments, area-wide spatial information is required. This paper demonstrates how hyperspectral remote sensing data and additional height data can provide a large part of this information efficiently, reducing the need for extensive field surveys. From the hyperspectral data the surface materials, the LAI and the surface albedo are estimated. The height data supplies the heights of buildings and trees.

1ea79267063a60e904ecea9346d1bb406d4ce57a	mapping of seismic parameters of the iberian peninsula by means of a geographic information system		In this paper, the following seismic parameters, the maximum recorded magnitude ((M_{max})), the Gutenberg–Ritcher b-value and the (normalized) mean seismic activity rate, AR, have been calculated for the Iberian Peninsula and surroundings. A geographic information system has been employed to compile all data, to work with different geographic systems and to generate the maps. An improved version of the National Geographic Institute of Spain earthquake catalog has been considered as input. Due to the detection network evolution and the extent of the territory, completeness values must be sectored to obtain reliable b-values and AR values. So, a previous work on regionalization has been considered. First, a working catalog has been elaborated. To do so, the size of some shocks through specific studies have been reviewed, magnitudes have been converted to moment magnitude ((M_{w})) and dependent events have been removed. Second, for the b-value and the AR calculation a method that considers inhomogeneous catalogs, different magnitudes and various years of completeness has been employed. Also, different decluster parameters and various minimum number of events have been considered. Finally, to represent the values, a multi-resolution grid ((0.5^{{{circ }}}times 0.5^{{{circ }}}), (1^{{{circ }}}times 1^{{{circ }}}) and (2^{{{circ }}}times 2^{{{circ }}})) has been deployed. The pictures obtained show the seismicity in the terms of size, stress-meter and frequency. The highest (M_{max}) has been obtained in the SW of the Iberian Peninsula with a marine epicenter. Regarding the b-value, in the contact boundary between the Africa and Eurasian plates this value is around 1.0 or minor. Contrariwise, in the mainland, values higher than 1.2 are predominant. Finally, the highest AR values are found in the SE of the Iberian Peninsula and remarkable values are also present in the NE.	geographic information system	José L.

It is an inland area characterized by a large deficit of rainfall. Changes in climate and land-use in the Tarim River basin have altered the vegetation patterns and dynamics in recent years. The objective of the paper is to understand how climate and human activities affect the ecoenvironment in the and region. In this study Landsat TM/ETM+ data from 1990 to 2000 were used in order to provide information of land-use changes. Time-series of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are shown to capture essential features of seasonal and inter-annual vegetation variability in this and area. Impact of climate change on liver runoff was assessed and compared with the effect of human activities on river discharge. It is found that distinct heterogeneities exist among different parts of the Tarim River basin. Although the change of climate increased the discharge of headstream, runoff of the lower reaches decreased because of the unreasoning farmland exploitation in the upper and middle reaches. Following the drying of watercourse, the trends of degradation and desertification are more aggressive in lower reaches of Tarim River.	elegant degradation	Fei Xiao;Baiping Zhang;Weiming Cheng;Yichi Zhang;Hongzhi Wu;Juan Xu;Yunhai Zhu	2005		10.1109/IGARSS.2005.1526451	geomorphology;normalized difference vegetation index;hydrology;soil science	HCI	83.61430537385831	-56.579358752264234	50962
7ea87ff943ce640c96724a70147dba6f77d5a179	modeling framework for simulating concentrations of solute chemicals, nanoparticles, and solids in surface waters and sediments: wasp8 advanced toxicant module		Abstract Toxicant concentrations in surface waters are of environmental concern due to their potential impacts to humans and wildlife. Numerical models provide system insight, support management decisions, and provide scenario testing on the impacts of toxicants. The Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program (WASP) is a widely used framework for developing site-specific models for simulating toxicant concentrations in surface waters and sediments over a range of complexities and temporal and spatial scales. WASP8, with the Advanced Toxicant module, has been recently released, incorporating a complete architecture redesign for an increased number of state variables and different state variable types. WASP8 incorporates a new structure for simulating light intensity and photoreactions in the water column, including the distinction of 10 different wavelength bands, and nanoparticle heteroaggregation to solids. We present a hypothetical case study, using the Cape Fear River, North Carolina as a representative example for simulating solute chemicals, nanoparticles, and solids to demonstrate the new and updated capabilities of WASP8.

We examined the response of the growing season maximum enhanced vegetation index (MEVI) to the growing season temperature, precipitation, vapor pressure and relative humidity on the Tibetan Plateau. The responses of the MEVI to climatic factors changed with the vegetation type, which may be attributed to the finding that the background values and climatic factor changes varied with the type of vegetation. The spatially averaged MEVI over the entire plateau exhibited a non-significant decreasing trend. Approximately 5% and 12% of the vegetation area exhibited significant MEVI decreasing and increasing trends, respectively. Both vapor pressure and relative humidity significantly affected the MEVI, whereas the temperature and precipitation did not significantly correlate with the MEVI over the entire plateau. Specifically, the environmental humidity dominated the MEVI variation over the entire plateau.	initial condition;stellar classification	Zhenxi Shen;Gang Fu;Chengqun Yu;Wei Sun;Xianzhou Zhang	2014	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs6086765	carbon;meteorology;enhanced vegetation index;ecosystem;precipitation;primary production;temperature;normalized difference vegetation index;respiration;hydrology;relative humidity;cover;climatology;leaf area index;ecology;vapor pressure;physics;remote sensing	HCI	84.30882974491583	-56.86814752448537	51234

A LME model considers the correlation that exists in the field measurements which have been performed repeatedly in space and time. In this study, models are developed based on the relation between the logarithmic scale of the water quality parameters and band ratios: B07:665 nm to B09:708.75 nm for log10chl-a and B06:620 nm to B04:510 nm for log10SDD. Cross validation is performed on the models. The results show good performance of the models, with Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE) and Mean Bias Errors (MBE) of 0.31 and 0.018 for log10chl-a, and 0.19 and 0.006 for log10SDD, respectively. The models are then applied to a time series of MERIS images acquired over Lake Erie from 2004–2012 to investigate the spatial and temporal variations of the water quality parameters. Produced maps reveal distinct monthly patterns for different regions of Lake Erie that are in agreement with known biogeochemical properties of the lake. The Detroit River and Maumee River carry sediments and nutrients to the shallow western basin. Hence, the shallow western basin of Lake Erie experiences the most intense algal blooms and the highest turbidity compared to the other sections of the lake. Maumee Bay, Sandusky Bay, Rondeau Bay and Long Point Bay are estimated to have prolonged intense algal bloom.	biogeochemistry;british informatics olympiad;fixed effects model;large marine ecosystem;learning to rank;logistics;map;mean squared error;sampling (signal processing);semiconductor industry;time series	Kiana Zolfaghari;Claude R.

The source for this variation is thought to be an interference effect due to buildup of an ice-like contaminant film on a ZnSe window, covered with an antireflective coating (ARC), of the cooled Dewar containing these detectors. Periodic warming of the dewar is required in order to remove the contaminant and restore detector response to an uncontaminated level. These effects in the IC data have been characterized over four individual outgassing cycles using thin-film models to estimate transmittance of the window/ARC and ARC/contaminant film stack throughout the instrument lifetime. Based on the results obtained from this modeling, a lookup table procedure has been implemented that provides correction factors to improve the calibration accuracy of bands 5 and 7 by approximately 5%.	3d film;conformal coating;focal (programming language);interference (communication);lookup table;sensor;tree accumulation	Dennis L.

3f3641dea30ba8dd9e61968fb04e2624178c53af	data assimilation of wildfires with fuel adjustment factors in farsite using ensemble kalman filtering*		This paper shows the extension of the wildfire simulation tool farsite to allow for data assimilation capabilities on both fire perimeters and fuel adjustment factors to improve the accuracy of wildfire spread predictions. While fire perimeters characterize the overall burn scar of a wildfire, fuel adjustment factors are fuel model specific calibration numbers that adjust the rate of spread for each fuel type independently. Data assimilation updates of both fire perimeters and fuel adjustment factors are calculated from an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) that exploits the uncertainty information on the simulated fire perimeter, fuel adjustment factors and a measured fire perimeter. The effectiveness of the proposed data assimilation is illustrated on a wildfire simulation representing the 2014 Cocos fire, tracking time varying fuel adjustment factors based on noisy and limited spatial resolution observations of the fire perimeter.	cocos2d;data assimilation;ensemble kalman filter;perimeter;simulation;wildfire modeling	Thayjes Srivas;Raymond A. de Callafon;Daniel Crawl;Ilkay Altintas	2017		10.1016/j.procs.2017.05.197		AI	87.75983381640177	-61.3184982348523	52384

Different degrees of soil erosion happen in everywhere except the permafrost area. When human society appears, soil erosion has become a dynamic process under the action of the natural and human activities [1]. In recent years, the remote sensing technology (RS) and geographic information systems technology (GIS) have a significant development which making a variety of related spatial analysis as possible. So in this paper, these two technologies were used to monitor and analyze the change and development trend of Guyuan County's soil erosion in 1998 and 2008.	geographic information system;reed–solomon error correction;spatial analysis	Jianming Liu;Wenji Zhao;Zhuowei Hu;Zhiheng Wang;Nobukazu Nakagoshi	2010	2010 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5653997	erosion;geology;hydrology;soil science;geographic information system;remote sensing	Embedded	82.92102042639395	-55.60481265391661	53148

This highlights the importance of understanding the ice sheet structure and dynamics. Although fundamental for a reliable 3D modeling of the ice subsurface, the development of automatic techniques for the integration of multisensor data acquired over the ice sheets is still very limited. To address this issue, in this paper we present an automatic technique that integrates two types of data, i.e., radargrams (vertical profiles of the ice) acquired by airborne radar sounder (RS) instruments and ice surface elevation data recorded by altimeter (ALT) instruments. The aim of the technique is to perform a 3D reconstruction of the ice sheet by estimating maps of the surface, bedrock and ice thickness at the best possible reliable scale. Initially, the estimations of both the surface map and the related uncertainty intervals are done at several different scales by geostatistically interpolating information extracted from the RS data. Afterwards, a validation of the interpolation results and the identification of the best interpolation scale are performed by integrating the ALT data. The best scale is then used to estimate the bedrock elevation map, following the same interpolation scheme used for the estimation of the surface elevation map. Finally, the ice thickness map is computed by subtraction. The method has been applied to a subset of RS and ALT data acquired over a portion of the Byrd Glacier in Antarctica.	3d modeling;3d reconstruction;airborne ranger;interpolation;map;radar;reed–solomon error correction;thickness (graph theory)	Ana-Maria Ilisei;Lorenzo Bruzzone	2015	2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7327012	meteorology;estimation;geodesy;interpolation;sea ice concentration;radar;statistics;remote sensing	Robotics	84.12136334749921	-61.82130543723379	53227

For this purpose, we carried out in situ measurements of FAPAR in two 2km×2km areas within the temperate meadow-steppe grassland in Hulunber during growing season in 2008. The MODIS FAPAR product reflected very well the seasonal dynamics of in situ FAPAR, but tended to overestimate the value with averaged relative error of 13.7% in the Stipa baicalensis site and 18.7% in the Leymus Chinensis site.

And the evolution mode of different dissimilar pore space is different. An intensive research on the characteristics, the evolution mode and the controlling factors of all kinds of pore space was carried out in Feixianguan Formation in Northeast Sichuan basin. The result of study indicated that the pore types include residual intergranular pore, dissolved pores between grains, dissolved pores in grains, intracrystalline pore, intercrystalline solution pores and fracture. The evolution mode of pore space is divided into three types (oolitic limestone shoal type, oolitic dolomite shoal type and the type without facies controlled). The formation of pore space is controlled by sedimentation, diagenesis and tectogenesis.

Digital canopy height models (DCHMs), which are differences between PRISM digital surface models and surveying-based digital terrain models (DTMs), were compared to in situ AGB measurements of several forest types (number of stands: 28; average stand size: 0.54 ha; stand size range: 0.25-3.00 ha). DCHM values exhibited a significant correlation with AGB (r = 0.66-0.87; five different DCHMs), and the root-mean-square error and bias of the regression model evaluated by the leave-one-out cross-validation were 37.2-57.8t/ha(22.1%-32.6%) and-0.11-1.89 t/ha, respectively. There was no saturation in the relationship between DCHM and AGB (AGB range: 19-332 t/ha). The correlations between DCHM and mean canopy height (r = 0.17-0.52) and between DCHM and Lorey's height (r = 0.26-0.66) were weaker than the correlation between DCHM and AGB. The PRISM AGB distribution estimated by the regression model was consistent with a tree density map produced from aerial photos. Comparison to Phased Array-type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data showed that the PRISM DCHMs can estimate high AGB over the saturation level of PALSAR backscattering coefficient, i.e., 100-200 t/ha. The results described here demonstrate that the PRISM DCHMs are capable of wall-to-wall AGB estimation at 50-m resolution. This approach will be useful for improving the performance of satellite-based AGB estimation when an accurate DTM is available.	aerial photography;coefficient;cross-validation (statistics);digital elevation model;digital geometry;glan–taylor prism;l band;motorola canopy;prism (surveillance program);phased array	Takeshi Motohka;Toshiya Yoshida;Hideaki Shibata;Takeo Tadono;Masanobu Shimada	2015	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2014.2346531	estimation;synthetic aperture radar;digital elevation model;forest;biomass;hydrology;correlation;physics;satellite;vegetation;remote sensing	Visualization	84.13933656312986	-61.08976624871296	53503

Here we present the results of this survey, which was answered by 125 participants from 99 operational and research institutions, belonging to 38 European countries. The typologies of environments where the snow measurements are performed range from mountain to low elevated plains, including forests, bogs, tundra, urban areas, glaciers, lake ice, and sea ice. Of the respondents, 93% measure snow macrophysical parameters, such as snow presence, snow depth (HS), snow water equivalent (SWE), and snow density. These describe the bulk characteristics of the whole snowpack or of a snow layer, and they are the primary snow properties that are needed for most operational applications (such as hydrological monitoring, avalanche forecast, and weather forecast). In most cases, these measurements are done with manual methods, although for snow presence, HS, and SWE, automatized methods are also applied by some respondents. Parameters characterizing precipitating and suspended snow (such as the height of new snow, precipitation intensity, flux of drifting/blowing snow, and particle size distribution), some of which are crucial for the operational services, are measured by 74% of the respondents. Parameters characterizing the snow microstructural properties (such as the snow grain size and shape, and specific surface area), the snow electromagnetic properties (such as albedo, brightness temperature, and backscatter), and the snow composition (such as impurities and isotopes) are measured by 41%, 26%, and 13% of the respondents, respectively, mostly for research applications. The results of this survey are discussed from the perspective of the need of enhancing the efficiency and coverage of the in-situ observational network applying automatic and cheap measurement methods. Moreover, recommendations for the enhancement and harmonization of the observational network and measurement practices are provided."""	avalanches;backscatter (email);bog;flux;forests;hydrology;isotopes;ninety nine;numerical analysis;numerical weather prediction;operations research;projections and predictions;snow;brightness	Roberta Pirazzini;Leena Leppänen;Ghislain Picard;Juan-Ignacio Lopez-Moreno;Christoph Marty;Giovanni Macelloni;Anna Kontu;Annakaisa von Lerber;Cemal Melih Tanis;Martin Schneebeli;Patricia de Rosnay;Ali Nadir Arslan	2018		10.3390/s18072016	snow;electronic engineering;civil engineering;engineering;commission	Metrics	83.41269173543098	-59.228065195726636	53784

We demonstrate its potential in landscape ecology for improving the quality of the resulting surfaces using indicator-coded presettlement land survey record data and the areal proportion of each species. The geostatistical interpolation method presented in this study explicitly models support differences between the source data and the prediction surface, while taking into account spatial dependence present in multiscale presettlement land survey record data. In this case study, we demonstrate that block indicator kriging with areal proportion data substantially increases the prediction accuracy and coherence using witness tree species data recorded in the northeast of Minnesota. The relative merit of the proposed geostatistical interpolation method to other conventional geostatistical approaches is illustrated through a comparative analysis, where continuous vegetation surfaces obtained from other approaches are compared with those obtained from the block indicator kriging with areal proportion data in terms of the prediction accuracy and consistency.	decision theory	E.-H.

On average, backscatter of a wet Douglas-fir canopy is ∼1.5 dB and ∼1 dB higher than the backscatter when the canopy is dry at VH and VV polarization respectively. No consistent differences were found in the case of the beech stand between wet and dry conditions. It is argued that the use of Sentinel-1 to retrieve the amount of intercepted rainfall is limited at best to a reliability of 50% and to canopies with large storage capacity.	backscatter (email);motorola canopy;polarization (waves);verification and validation	Cesar Cisneros Vaca;Christiaan van der Tol	2018	IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8517859	remote sensing;canopy;backscatter;radar;interception;temperate forest;computer science;precipitation;synthetic aperture radar;beech	Embedded	83.93111250828073	-62.660406822764514	53930
3d70e0cccd5ed2e62d94d9adb7ef41bfd9e44ac9	geo-social media as a proxy for hydrometeorological data for streamflow estimation and to improve flood monitoring		Floods are one of the most devastating types of worldwide disasters in terms of human, economic, and social losses. If authoritative data is scarce, or unavailable for some periods, other sources of information are required to improve streamflow estimation and early flood warnings. Georeferenced social media messages are increasingly being regarded as an alternative source of information for coping with flood risks. However, existing studies have mostly concentrated on the links between geo-social media activity and flooded areas. Thus, there is still a gap in research with regard to the use of social media as a proxy for rainfall-runoff estimations and flood forecasting. To address this, we propose using a transformation function that creates a proxy variable for rainfall by analysing geo-social media messages and rainfall measurements from authoritative sources, which are later incorporated within a hydrological model for streamflow estimation. We found that the combined use of official rainfall values with the social media proxy variable as input for the Probability Distributed Model (PDM), improved streamflow simulations for flood monitoring.

This paper developed a new data assimilation framework for consistent estimation of multiple land-surface parameters from time-series MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance data. If the reflectance data showed snow-free areas, an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) technique was used to estimate leaf area index (LAI) for a two-layer canopy reflectance model (ACRM) by combining predictions from a phenology model and the MODIS surface reflectance data. The estimated LAI values were then input into the ACRM to calculate the surface albedo and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR). For snow-covered areas, the surface albedo was calculated as the underlying vegetation canopy albedo plus the weighted distance between the underlying vegetation canopy albedo and the albedo over deep snow. The LAI/FAPAR and surface albedo values estimated using this framework were compared with MODIS collection 5 eight-day 1-km LAI/FAPAR products (MOD15A2) and 500-m surface albedo product (MCD43A3), and GEOV1 LAI/FAPAR products at 1/112° spatial resolution and a ten-day frequency, respectively, and validated by ground measurement data from several sites with different vegetation types. The results demonstrate that this new data assimilation framework can estimate temporally complete land-surface parameter profiles from MODIS time-series reflectance data even if some of the reflectance data are contaminated by residual cloud or are missing and that the retrieved LAI, FAPAR, and surface albedo values are physically consistent. The root mean square errors of the retrieved LAI, FAPAR, and surface albedo against ground measurements are 0.5791, 0.0453, and 0.0190, respectively.	algorithm;data assimilation;ensemble kalman filter;mean squared error;motorola canopy;time series	Zhiqiang Xiao;Shunlin Liang;Jindi Wang;Donghui Xie;Jinling Song;Rasmus Fensholt	2015	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2014.2370071	meteorology;snow;hydrology;predictive modelling;physics;albedo;remote sensing	Visualization	84.91634047292928	-62.10169990838981	54338

We consider the microstructural irregularities of SEGT as the essential factor that affects radar backscatter. To evaluate their contribution, this study uses the “slice” approach: particles close to the front of an incident radar wave are considered to reflect incident electromagnetic waves coherently. The radar equation for a SEGT is derived. The equation includes contributions to the total backscatter from correlated small-scale fluctuations in the slice's reflectivity. The correlation contribution changes in accordance with an idea proposed earlier by Smith (1964) based on physical consideration. The slice approach applied allows parameterizing the features of the SEGT's inhomogeneities.	backscatter (email);radar;randomness	Boris S.

8fbed889f4a6916c106199834bd2ef65b6a602cc	empirical models for estimating the suspended sediment concentration in amazonian white water rivers using landsat 5/tm	geology of the amazon;band ratios;interdisciplinar;multiple regressions;top of atmosphere reflectance;spectral bands;artigo;fluvial sediments	Suspended sediment yield is a very important environmental indicator within Amazonian fluvial systems, especially for rivers dominated by inorganic particles, referred to as white water rivers. For vast portions of Amazonian rivers, suspended sediment concentration (SSC) is measured infrequently or not at all. However, remote sensing techniques have been used to estimate water quality parameters worldwide, from which data for suspended matter is the most successfully retrieved. This paper presents empirical models for SSC retrieval in Amazonian white water rivers using reflectance data derived from Landsat 5/TM. The models use multiple regression for both the entire dataset (global model, N = 504) and for five segmented datasets (regional models) defined by general geological features of drainage basins. The models use VNIR bands, band ratios, and the SWIR band 5 as input. For the global model, the adjusted R2 is 0.76, while the adjusted R2 values for regional models vary from 0.77 to 0.89, all significant (p-value < 0.0001). The regional models are subject to the leave-one-out cross validation technique, which presents robust results. The findings show that both the average error of estimation and the standard deviation increase as the SSC range increases. Regional models were more accurate when compared with the global model, suggesting changes in optical proprieties of water sampled at different sampling stations. Results confirm the potential for the estimation of SSC from Landsat/TM historical series data for the 1980s and 1990s, for which the in situ database is scarce. Such estimates supplement the SSC temporal series, providing a more comprehensive SSC temporal series which may show environmental dynamics yet unknown.		Otávio C. Montanher;Evlyn M. L. M.

Generally, the direct comparison of TMPA precipitation estimates to 200 collocated rain gauges from 2006 to 2008 demonstrate that the spatial and temporal rainfall characteristics over the region are well captured by the assimilation estimates. Especially, results also show that using Kalman filter to assimilate TRMM-based multi-satellite real-time precipitation estimates tends to perform well over regions, where gauge network is rather sparse. Last, this study highlights that accurate detection and estimation of precipitation in the summer season by Kalman filter, particularly for nonlinear convective precipitation events, is still a challenging task for the future development of assimilation technique for improving the satellite-based precipitation accuracy.	data assimilation;experiment;kalman filter;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical weather prediction;probability of precipitation;real-time clock;sensor;sparse matrix	Jiaqi Chen;Bin Yong;Liliang Ren;Weiguang Wang;Bo Chen;Jianan Lin;Zhongbo Yu;Ning Li	2016	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs8110899	meteorology;quantitative precipitation estimation;data assimilation;precipitation;climatology;physics;satellite;remote sensing	Robotics	83.81503559922075	-60.20021308397434	55417

The microwave data were acquired over a natural Virginia Pine forest in Maryland by a ground-based microwave active/passive instrument system in 2008/2009. Ground measurements of the tree biophysical parameters and forest floor characteristics were obtained during the field campaign. The test site consisted of medium-sized evergreen conifers with an average height of 12 m and average diameters at breast height of 12.6 cm. The site is a typical pine forest site in that there is a surface layer of loose debris/needles and an organic transition layer above the mineral soil. In an effort to characterize and model the impact of the surface litter layer, an experiment was conducted on a day with wet soil conditions, which involved removal of the surface litter layer from one half of the test site while keeping the other half undisturbed. The observations showed detectable decrease in emissivity for both polarizations after the surface litter layer was removed. A first-order radiative transfer model of the forest stands including the multilayer nature of the forest floor in conjunction with the ground truth data are used to compute forest emission. The model calculations reproduced the major features of the experimental data over the entire duration, which included the effects of surface litter and ground moisture content on overall emission. Both theory and experimental results confirm that the litter layer increases the observed canopy brightness temperature and obscure the soil emission.	first-order reduction;ground truth;human height;l band;microwave;motorola canopy;random forest;the forest	Mehmet Kurum;Peggy O'Neill;Roger H.

Remotely sensed microwave radiobrightness observations can cover large scales but have limited resolution and are only indirectly related to the hydrologic variables of interest. We describe a four-dimensional (4-D) variational assimilation algorithm that makes best use of available information while accounting for both measurement and model uncertainty. The representer method used here is more efficient than a Kalman filter because it avoids explicit propagation of state error covariances. In a synthetic example, which is based on a field experiment, we demonstrate estimation performance by examining data residuals. Such tests provide a convenient way to check the statistical assumptions of the approach and to assess its operational feasibility. Internally computed covariances show that the estimation error decreases with increasing soil moisture. An adjoint analysis reveals that trends in model errors in the soil moisture equation can be estimated from daily L-band brightness measurements, whereas model errors in the soil and canopy temperature equations cannot be adequately retrieved from daily data alone. Nonetheless, state estimates obtained from the assimilation algorithm improve significantly on prior model predictions derived without assimilation of radiobrightness data.	algorithm;data assimilation;kalman filter;l band;limited availability;microwave;motorola canopy;software propagation;synthetic intelligence;variational principle	Rolf Reichle;Dennis McLaughlin;Dara Entekhabi	2001	IEEE Trans.

eca187374bd0d5cd9fb9451d45e21cd4f49e87ab	protecting bias: across time and ecology, open-source bat locality data are heavily biased by distance to protected area		Abstract Open-source species locality data are widely used in species distribution modeling but may be spatially biased by uneven sampling effort across a speciesu0027 range. Spatial biases may vary across ecological trait groups if traits affect associations with landscape features and capture probability. Furthermore, spatial biases may change across time as research priorities, funding, and methodologies change, which may confound modeling of temporal changes in distributions. We used locality records from 93 bat species from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility to characterize the differential contribution of bias variables to spatial bias and how contribution varied across ecological trait groups. Next, we examined how historical changes in protected area proliferation, economic development, and sampling method advancement affected protected area and university biases. Roosting and foraging traits influenced spatial bias, but distance to protected areas was the greatest contributor to spatial sampling bias in a pooled model and 8 out of 10 ecological trait group models. Over time, distance to protected areas significantly decreased following protected area proliferation, but economic improvement did not influence distance to universities. Sampling method advancements increased protected area bias for two out of three foraging groups. Although sampling effort has increased over time, effort is becoming more biased towards protected areas, which may not encompass the entirety of speciesu0027 ranges or allow for equal sampling across taxa. Characterizing spatial bias differences among species and across time clarifies underlying causes of spatial bias, information that can be leveraged to improve spatial bias correction.	ecology;locality of reference;open-source software	Marina Fisher-Phelps;Guofeng Cao;Rebecca M.

The analysis made use of comprehensive simulations accounting for multiple scattering, sea surface roughness, sensor viewing geometry, actual coastline, typical and extreme atmospheric conditions, and the seasonal variability of solar illumination and, land and water optical properties. Results, obtained by relying on the normalization of the radiometric sensitivity of each sensor to the same input radiance, show that the spectral and seasonal impacts of AE considerably vary among sensors. AE significantly exceed the radiometric sensitivity of MSI at its sole blue band in winter, whereas they significantly outdo the noise threshold of OLI and MODISA high-resolution data exclusively in the NIR in summer. Conversely, for all other sensors and for MODISA low-resolution data, AE are particularly significant at NIR bands between March and October and at the blue–green bands in winter.	aqua;heart rate variability;image resolution;image sensor;metric;multispectral image;simulation	Barbara Bulgarelli;Giuseppe Zibordi	2018	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2017.2781900	moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer;mathematics;radiometry;remote sensing;ocean color;multispectral image;radiance;imaging spectrometer	Vision	83.50126449532188	-60.93640231139138	55783

The semiempirical modeling of forest canopy volume backscattering and extinction properties is based on high-resolution data from our ranging scatterometer HUTSCAT. The response of ERS-1 SAR to forest stem volume (biomass) and other forest characteristics is investigated by employing the National Forest Inventory sample plots, stand-wise forest inventory data and LANDSATand SPOT-based digital land use maps. The results show that the correlation between the backscattering coefficient and forest stem volume (biomass) varies from positive to negative depending on canopy and soil moisture. Additionally, the seasonal snow cover and soil freezinghhawing effects cause drastic changes in the r ada r response. A novel method for the estimation of forest stem volume (biomass) is introduced. This technique is based on the use of: 1) multitemporal ERS-1 SAR data; 2) reference sample plot information; and 3) the semiempirical backscattering model. I t is shown that the multitemporal ERS-1 SAR images can be successfully used for estimating the forest stem volume. The effects of soil moisture variations to ERS-1 SAR results have been analyzed using hydrological soil moisture model and in situ data. The results indicate that the semiempirical model can be used for predicting the soil and canopy moisture variations in ERS-1 images.	ada;backscatter (email);coefficient;computational chemistry;image resolution;map;motorola canopy;random forest;semi-empirical quantum chemistry method;the forest	Jouni Pulliainen;P.

566c6a360ac7bc2abcc97a97cbe077581570a7e8	comparison of electrochemical concentration cell ozonesonde and microwave limb sounder satellite remote sensing ozone profiles for the center of the south asian high		To further verify the ozone profile reliability of satellite remote sensing for the ozone valley over the Tibetan Plateau in the core area of the South Asian high in summer, we validate the ozone products from the microwave limb sounder (MLS) onboard the Aura satellite over the Tibetan plateau using electrochemical concentration cell (ECC) ozonesonde data of 2016 for Ngari, Tibet. The MLS version four ozone profiles have lower standard deviation in the middle stratosphere (38–10 hPa), whereas the ozonesonde profiles have lower standard deviation in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere region (200–83 hPa). There are statistically significant differences between these two datasets in most of the stratosphere (10–83 hPa). The mean value of MLS ozone is about 0.8–1.5 mPa greater than that of ECC ozone, which corresponds to a relative deviation of 59 ± 24% at 83 hPa, 24 ± 13% at 68 hPa, 20 ± 5% at 56 hPa, 14 ± 4% at 46 hPa and 38 hPa, and 9 ± 4% in the layers between 32 and 10 hPa. However, there is no statistically significant difference between the two datasets in the upper troposphere (100–200 hPa).	cell signaling;core (optical fiber);dvd region code;ecc memory;google summer of code;microwave	Chunhua Shi;Chenxin Zhang;Dong Guo	2017	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs9101012	remote sensing;relative standard deviation;geology;troposphere;standard deviation;ozone;atmospheric sciences;stratosphere;microwave limb sounder	HCI	83.7011296957788	-62.07477919858278	56676

However, the available global percent tree cover products are few, and efforts to validate these maps have been limited. Therefore, producing a new broad-scale percent tree cover dataset is valuable. Our study was undertaken to map tree cover percentage, on a global scale, with better accuracy than previous studies. Using a modified supervised regression tree algorithm from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data of 2008, the tree cover percentage was estimated at 500 m resolution in Eurasia. Training data were created by simulation using reference data interpreted from Google Earth. We collected approximately 716 high-resolution images from Google Earth. The regression tree model was modified to fit those images for improved accuracy. Our estimation result was validated using 307 points. The root mean square error (RMSE) between estimated and observed tree cover was 11.2%, and the weighted RMSE between them, in which five tree cover strata (0%–20%, 21%–40%, 41%–60%, 61%–80%, and 81%–100%) were weighted equally, was 14.2%. The result was compared to existing global percent-scale tree cover datasets. We found that existing datasets had some pixels with estimation error of more than 50% and each map had different characteristics. Our map could be an alternative dataset and other existing datasets could be modified using our resultant map.

As these emissions are diffuse in nature, estimations based upon emission factors and dispersion/advection equations need to be measured directly from the atmosphere. This paper expands upon previous research undertaken to develop a relative methodology to monitor PM10 dust particles produced by mining activities making use of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). A module sensor using a laser particle counter (OPC-N2 from Alphasense, Great Notley, Essex, UK) was tested. An aerodynamic flow experiment was undertaken to determine the position and length of a sampling probe of the sensing module. Flight tests were conducted in order to demonstrate that the sensor provided data which could be used to calculate the emission rate of a source. Emission rates are a critical variable for further predictive dispersion estimates. First, data collected by the airborne module was verified using a 5.0 m tower in which a TSI DRX 8533 (reference dust monitoring device, TSI, Shoreview, MN, USA) and a duplicate of the module sensor were installed. Second, concentration values collected by the monitoring module attached to the UAV (airborne module) obtaining a percentage error of 1.1%. Finally, emission rates from the source were calculated, with airborne data, obtaining errors as low as 1.2%. These errors are low and indicate that the readings collected with the airborne module are comparable to the TSI DRX and could be used to obtain specific emission factors from fugitive emissions for industrial activities.	ap 42 compilation of air pollutant emission factors;aerial photography;airborne ranger;approximation error;blast;coal;drug vehicle;emission - male genitalia finding;estimated;gases;influenza virus a n2 ab:prthr:pt:ser:ord;monitoring device;open platform communications;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;sensor;thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins;time-slot interchange;unmanned aerial vehicle	Miguel Alvarado;Luis Felipe Gonzalez;Peter Erskine;David Cliff;Darlene Heuff	2017		10.3390/s17020343	particulates;simulation;engineering;forensic engineering;remote sensing	HCI	88.70055446710025	-54.34233421411591	57263
3a5a3f3f49a688629828d389ec525072f4f518ef	spectro-temporal heterogeneity measures from dense high spatial resolution satellite image time series: application to grassland species diversity estimation		Grasslands represent a significant source of biodiversity that is important to monitor over large extents. The Spectral Variation Hypothesis (SVH) assumes that the Spectral Heterogeneity (SH) measured from remote sensing data can be used as a proxy for species diversity. Here, we argue the hypothesis that the grassland’s species differ in their phenology and, hence, that the temporal variations can be used in addition to the spectral variations. The purpose of this study is to attempt verifying the SVH in grasslands using the temporal information provided by dense Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) with a high spatial resolution. Our method to assess the spectro-temporal heterogeneity is based on a clustering of grasslands using a robust technique for high dimensional data. We propose new SH measures derived from this clustering and computed at the grassland level. We compare them to the Mean Distance to Centroid (MDC). The method is experimented on 192 grasslands from southwest France using an intraannual multispectral SPOT5 SITS comprising 18 images and using single images from this SITS. The combination of two of the proposed SH measures—the within-class variability and the entropy—in a multivariate linear model explained the variance of the grasslands’ Shannon index more than the MDC. However, there were no significant differences between the predicted values issued from the best models using multitemporal and monotemporal imagery. We conclude that multitemporal data at a spatial resolution of 10 m do not contribute to estimating the species diversity. The temporal variations may be more related to the effect of management practices.	automation;autostereogram;cluster analysis;computer science;françois lionet;general linear model;habitat;jean;linear algebra;multispectral image;pc bruno;philippe kruchten;shannon (unit);spatial variability;stellar classification;time series;verification and validation;wilfried brauer	Maïlys Lopes;Mathieu Fauvel;Annie Ouin;Stéphane Girard	2017	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs9100993	remote sensing;multispectral image;geology;linear model;alpha diversity;cluster analysis;clustering high-dimensional data;satellite image time series;diversity index;species diversity	ML	84.85804455740139	-58.65111819710505	57286

The goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of species distribution modeling techniques for estimating the distribution of forest canopy species on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA. Binary maps of estimated presence/absence were produced for four canopy species using a classification tree approach and a generalized linear modeling approach, both including and excluding a spatial dependence term, and the results are evaluated using several assessment measures. Secondary goals of the study are to examine the influence of past land use on species distributions at the landscape scale and to consider the effect of explicitly including information on spatial dependence. Findings suggest that these techniques are broadly applicable in such human-dominated landscapes, but that complex disturbance histories introduce significant challenges.	decision tree learning;map;motorola canopy	Stephen McCauley;John Rogan;Jennifer Miller	2013	IJAGR	10.4018/jagr.2013070103	geography;temperate rainforest;species richness;ecology;agroforestry;old-growth forest	Web+IR	85.06497740456035	-55.305302534482536	57554

This paper investigates SMAP normalized radar cross sections (NRCS) dependence on wind vectors using more than 5 million matchups consisting of Defense Meteorological Satellite Program F17 Special Sensor Microwave Image/Sounder wind speed, National Center for Environmental Predication wind direction and SMAP L-band NRCS. An L-band geophysical model function (GMF) is proposed for SMAP wind retrieval on the basis of these matchups, and it indicates wind speed and direction dependence of SMAP L-band NRCS for about 40° incidence angle and 0-25 m/s wind speed range in both HH and VV polarization. The wind speed dependence increases rapidly with wind speed, and HH-polarized one is greater than VV polarization. The upwind-downwind difference for HH polarization is greater than that for VV polarization. A negative upwind-crosswind asymmetry occurs for HH- and VV-polarized backscatter at lower wind speeds. The retrieved SMAP wind speed using the proposed GMF is validated by using National Data Buoy Center buoy winds. The root mean square differences and biases are 1.77 and 0.19 m/s, respectively. The accuracies of SMAP wind speeds at 0-10 m/s range are better than those at higher wind speed range. In addition, SMAP wind speeds in upwind and downwind directions are relatively more accurate than those in crosswind directions.	aperture (software);backscatter (email);cross reactions;environmental wind;gmfb gene;graphical modeling framework;greater than;incidence matrix;l band;mean squared error;meter per second;microwave;plant roots;polarization (waves);polarized 3d system;speed (motion);synthetic data;vaccinia virus;verification and validation;omacetaxine mepesuccinate	Xuan Zhou;Jinsong Chong;Xiaofeng Yang;Wei Li;Xiaoxuan Guo	2017	IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing	10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2630919	wind speed;meteorology;l band;synthetic aperture radar;image resolution;atmospheric sciences;physics;satellite;remote sensing	Vision	83.01994052767857	-63.20979752503678	57779

In this paper we have shown that the validity domain of the Bragg/composite surface theory can be extended to low grazing angles by taking into account the contribution of second order scattering effects into the first order at small scale. An improved two scale model (TSM) has been investigated at low grazing angles for (radar frequencies) L-, C- and Ku-band with wind speeds of 7m/s and 15m/s. It is observed that for higher wind speeds the intensity of σ ΗΗ  increases up to 8 dB. In backscattering configuration predictions of the model are compared with the experimental data at Ku-band. Comparison shows good agreement at higher wind speeds. Finally, we use the improved TSM to predict the sea scattering in bistatic configuration and compare the results with classical TSM.

Hence, at low to moderate wind speeds (between cut-in and rated turbine wind speeds) when the thrust coefficient is high, wake losses are proportionally larger and decrease to be virtually undetectable at wind speeds above rated wind speeds. Wind direction is also critical. Not only does it determine the effective spacing between turbines but also the wind speed distribution is primarily determined by synoptic forcing and typically has a predominant direction from which wind speeds tend to be higher (from southwest for much of the central United States and northern Europe). Two other interlinked variables, turbulence intensity (TI), and atmospheric stability also dictate wake losses. Quantifying, understanding, modeling, and predicting this complex and interdependent system is therefore critical to understanding and modeling wind farm power losses due to wakes, and to optimizing wind farm layout. This paper quantifies the impact of these variables on the power loss due to wakes using data from the large offshore wind farms located at Horns Rev and Nysted in Denmark.	coefficient;interdependence;rev;the hub (forum);thrust;turbulence;usb hub	Rebecca J.

Nevertheless, as with sensors already used in temperature remote sensing (e.g., Landsat satellites), a radiance atmospheric correction is necessary to estimate land surface temperature. This is because atmospheric conditions at any sUAS flight elevation will have an adverse impact on the image accuracy, derived calculations, and study replicability using the microbolometer technology. This study presents a vicarious calibration methodology (sUAS-specific, time-specific, flight-specific, and sensor-specific) for sUAS temperature imagery traceable back to NIST-standards and current atmospheric correction methods. For this methodology, a three-year data collection campaign with a sUAS called """"AggieAir"""", developed at Utah State University, was performed for vineyards near Lodi, California, for flights conducted at different times (early morning, Landsat overpass, and mid-afternoon"""") and seasonal conditions. From the results of this study, it was found that, despite the spectral response of microbolometer cameras (7.0 to 14.0 μm), it was possible to account for the effects of atmospheric and sUAS operational conditions, regardless of time and weather, to acquire accurate surface temperature data. In addition, it was found that the main atmospheric correction parameters (transmissivity and atmospheric radiance) significantly varied over the course of a day. These parameters fluctuated the most in early morning and partially stabilized in Landsat overpass and in mid-afternoon times. In terms of accuracy, estimated atmospheric correction parameters presented adequate statistics (confidence bounds under ±0.1 for transmissivity and ±1.2 W/m²/sr/um for atmospheric radiance, with a range of RMSE below 1.0 W/m²/sr/um) for all sUAS flights. Differences in estimated temperatures between original thermal image and the vicarious calibration procedure reported here were estimated from -5 °C to 10 °C for early morning, and from 0 to 20 °C for Landsat overpass and mid-afternoon times."""	aerial photography;calibration;data collection;guided imagery;microbolometer;pixel;satellite viruses;traceability;unified model;unmanned aerial vehicle;sensor (device);standards characteristics	Alfonso Torres-Rua	2017		10.3390/s17071499	engineering;calibration;elevation;remote sensing;satellite;microbolometer;meteorology;radiance;thermal;atmospheric correction;image resolution	HCI	83.39842090574228	-61.19972664681074	58384

The factors driving the variation of the TSS spatial distribution are also discussed. Two field surveys, conducted on August 29 and October 26, 2012, showed that there was a strong linear relationship (R2 = 0.9623) between field-surveyed OBS (optical backscatter) measurements (5-31NTU) and laboratory-analyzed TSS concentrations (9.89–35.58 mg/L). The COST image-based atmospheric correction procedure and the pseudo-invariant features (PIF) method were combined to remove the atmospheric effects from the total radiance measurements obtained with different CCDs onboard the HJ-1A/1B satellites. Then, a simple and practical retrieval model was established based on the relationship between the satellite-corrected reflectance band ratio of band 3 and band 2 (Rrs3/Rrs2) and in-situ TSS measurements. The R2 of the regression relationship was 0.807, and the mean relative error (MRE) was 12.78%, as determined through in-situ data validation. Finally, the influences of tide cycles, wind factors (direction and speed) and other factors on the variation of the TSS spatial pattern observed from HJ-1A/1B satellite images from September through November of 2008 are discussed. The results show that HJ-1A/1B satellite CCD images can be used to estimate TSS concentrations under different tides in the study area over synoptic scales without using simultaneous in-situ atmospheric parameters and spectrum data. These findings provide strong informational support for numerical simulation studies on the combined influence of tide cycles and other associated hydrologic elements in Deep Bay.	charge-coupled device	Liqiao Tian;Onyx W.

The proposed procedure combines geologic knowledge, coded well data logs stored in a hydrogeologic georeferenced database, geographic information system (GIS) and 3D calculation software to reconstruct the detailed distribution of the subsoil’s hydrogeologic parameters. The calculations may apply to any subsoil part, bounded by one or more surfaces. This methodological approach may be applied to diverse investigation depths, vertical intervals detailed to varying extents, on a local or regional scale. Employing great quantities of well data logs, recorded in different ways and distributed across large areas, has enabled significant spatial sedimentologic reconstruction. Two groups of parameters were considered: textural (percentages of gravel, sand and clay) and hydrogeologic (hydraulic conductivity and porosity). In terms of sedimentology, the method reconstructs spatial heterogeneity both along crosssections and for an entire user-defined volume to analyze the sediments’ energy functions and their distribution; deposition rates are proportional to process intensity and distribution with time. In terms of hydrogeology, detailed 3D hydrogeologic structural data provide detailed input for hydrogeologic models in groundwater resource management and planning, such as for transport models. r 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

However; other climate variables including temperature; humidity; the frequency and intensity of precipitation events are also known to affect productivity; either directly by changing photosynthesis and transpiration rates or indirectly by influencing water availability and plant physiology. The aim here is to quantify the spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation responses to precipitation and to additional; relevant; meteorological variables. First; an empirical; statistical analysis of the relationship between precipitation and the additional meteorological variables and a proxy of vegetation productivity (the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; NDVI) is reported and; second; a process-oriented modeling approach to explore the hydrologic and biophysical mechanisms to which the significant empirical relationships might be attributed. The analysis was conducted in Sub-Saharan Africa; between 5 and 18°N; for a 25-year period 1982–2006; and used a new quasi-daily Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) dataset. The results suggest that vegetation; particularly in the wetter areas; does not always respond directly and proportionately to precipitation variation; either because of the non-linearity of soil moisture recharge in response to increases in precipitation; or because variations in temperature and humidity attenuate the vegetation responses to changes in water availability. We also find that productivity; independent of changes in total precipitation; is responsive to intra-annual precipitation variation. A significant consequence is that the degree of correlation of all the meteorological variables with productivity varies geographically; so no one formulation is adequate for the entire region. Put together; these results demonstrate that vegetation responses to meteorological variation are more complex than an equilibrium relationship between precipitation and productivity. In addition to their intrinsic interest; the findings have important implications for detection of anthropogenic dryland degradation (desertification); for which the effects of natural fluctuations in meteorological variables must be controlled in order to reveal non-meteorological; including anthropogenic; degradation.	heart rate variability	Khaldoun Rishmawi;Stephen D.

This consideration has a notable impact on natural hazard analyses which seek to determine population exposure and risk. This paper focuses on the coupling of population and environmental models to address the effect of seasonally varying populations on exposure to flood risk. A spatiotemporal population modelling tool, SurfaceBuilder247, has been combined with LISFLOOD-FP flood inundation model outputs for a study area centred on the coastal resort town of St Austell, Cornwall, United Kingdom (UK). Results indicate strong seasonal cycles in populations and their exposure to flood hazard which are not accounted for in traditional population datasets and flood hazard assessments. Therefore, this paper identifies and demonstrates considerable enhancements to the current handling of spatiotemporal population variation within hazard exposure assessment and disaster risk management.	baseline (configuration management);flood fill;image resolution;population model;quantum fluctuation;risk management;syn flood;spatial variability;velocity (software development)	Alan Smith;Andy Newing;Niall Quinn;David J.

cefec955b446325baa7b33fcd0d2eef376262ef3	differences in rate and direction of shifts between phytoplankton size structure and sea surface temperature	particle size distribution;phytoplankton size structure;climate velocity;species migration;global warming	Species distributions are changing with various rates and directions in response to recent global warming. The velocity of sea surface temperature (SST) has been used to predict species migration and persistence as an expectation of how species track their thermal niches; however, several studies have found that evidence for species shifts has deviated from the velocity of SST. This study investigated whether estimation of the velocity of shifts in phytoplankton size structure using remote sensing data could contribute to better prediction of species shifts. A chlorophyll-a (Chla) size distribution (CSD) model was developed by quantifying the relationships between the size structure of the phytoplankton community and the spectral features of the phytoplankton absorption coefficient (aph(λ)), based on the principal component analysis approach. Model validation demonstrated that the exponent of CSD (hereafter, CSD slope), which can describe the synoptic size structure of a phytoplankton community, was derived successfully with a relative root mean square error of 18.5%. The median velocity of CSD slope across the ocean was 485.2 km·decade−1, broadly similar to Chla (531.5 km·decade−1). These values were twice the velocity of SST, and the directions of shifts in CSD slope and Chla were quite different from that of SST. Because Chla is generally covariant with the size structure of a phytoplankton community, we believe that spatiotemporal changes in Chla can explain the variations of phytoplankton size structure. Obvious differences in both rate and direction of shifts were found between the phytoplankton size structure and SST, implying that shifts of phytoplankton size structure could be a powerful tool for assessing the distributional shifts of marine species. Our results will contribute to generate global and regional maps of expected species shifts in response to environmental forcing.	cambridge structural database;coefficient;map;marine ecosystem;mean squared error;mechatronics;persistence (computer science);principal component analysis;velocity (software development)	Hisatomo Waga;Toru Hirawake;Amane Fujiwara;Takashi Kikuchi;Shigeto Nishino;Koji Suzuki;Shintaro Takao;Sei-Ichi Saitoh	2017	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs9030222	oceanography;global warming;particle-size distribution;climatology;ecology;physics	HCI	84.86547277804925	-56.66958535824286	58922

However, InSAR is affected by variations in round-trip propagation delay due to changes in ionospheric total electron content and in tropospheric humidity and temperature along the signal path. One of the largest sources of uncertainty in estimates of tropospheric path delay is the spatial and temporal variability of water vapor density, which currently limits the quality of InSAR products. This problem can be partially addressed by using a number of SAR interferograms from subsequent satellite overpasses to reduce the degradation in the images or by analyzing a long time series of interferometric phases from permanent scatterers. However, if there is a sudden deformation of the Earth's surface, the detection of which is one of the principal objectives of InSAR measurements over land, the effect of water vapor variations cannot be removed, reducing the quality of the interferometric products. In those cases, high-resolution information on the atmospheric water vapor content and its variation with time can be crucial to mitigate the effect of wet-tropospheric path delay variations. This paper describes the use of a ground-based microwave radiometer network to retrieve 3-D water vapor density with fine spatial and temporal resolution, which can be used to reduce InSAR ambiguities due to changes in wet-tropospheric path delay. Retrieval results and comparisons between the integrated water vapor measured by the radiometer network and satellite data are presented.	aperture (software);digital elevation model;elegant degradation;image resolution;microwave;propagation delay;round-trip engineering;software propagation;spatial variability;synthetic data;time series;total electron content	Swaroop Sahoo;Steven C.

Five global land cover data sets derived from moderate-resolution satellites, i.e., Global Land Cover Characterization (GLCC), University of Maryland land cover product (UMd), Global Land Cover 2000 project data (GLC2000), MODIS Land Cover product (MODIS LC), and GLOBCOVER land cover product (GlobCover), have been widely used in many researches. However, these data sets were produced using different data sources and class definitions, which led to high uncertainty and inconsistency when using them. This study looked into the consistencies and discrepancies among the five data sets in China. All of the compared data sets were aggregated to consistent spatial resolution and extent, along with a 12-class thematic classification schema; intercomparisons among five datasets and each with reference data GLCD-2005 were performed. Results show reasonable agreement across the five data sets over China in terms of the dominating land cover types like Grassland and Cropland; while discrepancies of Forest classes, particularly Shrubland and Wetland among them are great. Additionally, GLC2000 has the highest agreement with GLCD-2005; MODIS LC gets the highest map-specific consistency compared with others; whereas UMd has the lowest agreement with GLCD-2005, but also has the lowest map-specific consistency.

8d840b9bd88ca30e27b1cfcd94c98ba217bd6c6e	improving ground surface temperature and heat flux simulation with satellite derived emissivity in arid and semiarid regions	soil climatology emissivity land surface temperature radiometry;land surface land surface temperature heating atmospheric modeling soil glass satellites;land surface model land surface emissivity glass modis	Land surface emissivity is a critical factor controlling the energy budget on earth surface. However, this important parameter is poorly represented utilizing the “constant-ε” assumption in the state-of-the-art land surface models as well as climate models due to lack of observations. Satellite sensors such as the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer(AVHRR) and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectrometer(MODIS) can provide Narrow Band Emissivity (NBE) products. These NBE products need to be preprocessed to produce reliable Broad Band Emissivity (BBE) which can be then assimilated into land surface models. This paper presents a preliminary sensitivity study of land surface energy balance simulation utilizing the long-term Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) BBE product in the arid and semiarid regions of northwestern China. We find that the GLASS-based land surface emissivities in the study region show great spatial and temporal variabilities. Satellite derived emissivity for bare soil ranges from 0.90 to 0.985 and more than half of bare soil grids over our study region have emissivity values less than 0.94. Decreased emissivity would lead to increased surface temperature and sensible heat flux. In-situ simulation results indicate that the ground surface temperature and heat fluxes simulations can be improved when satellite derived emissivity is assimilated.	climate model;data pre-processing;image resolution;sensor;simulation	Bin Peng;Jiancheng Shi;Yonghui Lei;Tianjie Zhao;Dongyang Li;Chuan Xiong	2014	2014 IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2014.6946402	atmospheric sciences;hydrology;remote sensing	Vision	84.28018506735339	-61.08843717584457	59862
5089870d8f2a21714eddf50e1d8b27dee08d1521	annual glacier-wide mass balance (2000-2016) of the interior tibetan plateau reconstructed from modis albedo products		Glaciers in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) play a crucial role in regulating agriculture irrigation, river discharge and the regional/global climate system. However, mass balance records of TP glaciers have remained scarce due to challenging mountainous terrain and harsh weather conditions, which limits our understanding of the influence of melting glaciers on local water resources and responses to climate change. Here, we present and assess an albedo-based method to derive annual mass balance for three glaciers in the interior TP from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) albedo data during 2000–2016. A strong linear correlation (R2 = 0.941, P < 0.001) is found between annual minimum-averaged glacier-wide albedo (AMGA) values and annual mass balance measurements on the Xiao Dongkemadi glacier. Furthermore, the 17-year-long annual mass balance series of the Xiao Dongkemadi glacier and the Geladandong mountain region glaciers, and the Purogangri ice cap are reconstructed for the first time, with a mass loss rate of 535 ± 63 mm w.e.a−1, 243 ± 66 mm w.e.a−1 and 113 ± 68 mm w.e.a−1, respectively. The results are verified by geodetic estimates, with relative error ranging from 4.55% to 11.80%, confirming that the albedo-based method can be used to estimate specific mass budgets for interior TP glaciers. A strong correlation between the mass balance series and air temperature infers that increasing summer air temperature may be one of main reasons for glacier shrinkage of the three studied glaciers.	amga;academy;approximation error;computation;discharger;emoticon;experiment;geodetic datum;image sensor;mass effect trilogy;nx bit;pic microcontroller;plateau effect;requirement;scott continuity	Zhimin Zhang;Liming Jiang;Lin Liu;Yafei Sun;Hansheng Wang	2018	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs10071031		Theory	84.56333419369405	-58.29423650518826	59906

d60051d9c4ffe4d93eb6ce1fbaf712d31f268607	on the quantification of surface changes using grid-based digital elevation models (dems)	digital elevation model	This paper discusses the quantification of vertical surface displacements by means of grid-based digital elevation models (DEMs). The surface changes are quantified by comparing altitude and different topographic parameters, which have a geomorphic significance with respect to surface changes. This paper describes the choice of different spatial calculation techniques, considering DEM accuracy and the propagation of error for the different topographic parameters involved. The techniques are illustrated on two grid-based DEMs from Finsterwalderbreen, a 35 km2 sized valley glacier on south-western Spitzbergen, Norwegian High Arctic.	digital elevation model	Bernd Etzelmüller	2000	Trans.

The EnKF is built around a stochastic formulation of the model, where some of its parameters are assumed to be uncertain. These uncertainties turn out to be the main reason behind the differences between the model predictions and the real measurements. The filter estimates these parameters as well as the ozone concentration field by using ground-based measurements from the Airbase database. The assimilation experiments are carried out over a region that consists of Belgium, Luxembourg, and some small parts of Germany, France and the Netherlands. The simulations results show that the EnKF significantly reduces the error of the ozone estimations.	data assimilation;ensemble kalman filter;experiment;simulation	Oscar Mauricio Agudelo;Oscar Barrero;Viaene Peter;Bart De Moor	2011	IEEE Conference on Decision and Control and European Control Conference	10.1109/CDC.2011.6160444	kalman filter;stochastic process;boundary value problem;mathematics	Robotics	86.8576355131918	-63.30534122150051	60488

The purpose of the tests is two-fold. First, footprint-matching methods can be tuned to adjust both the degree of match to a target pattern and the level of composite measurement radiometric noise. Useful measures of each of these factors are needed in order to trade-off the benefits of each, complete the matching algorithm design, and run retrieval algorithms that use measurement error characteristics as a constraint. Second, environmental parameter retrieval skill depends on the quality of the footprint matching design, and we need to be able to evaluate what radiometric and spatial quality levels are optimal with respect to retrieval performance. To evaluate the diagnostic parameters, we simulated composite footprints from sensor patterns projected on a spherical-Earth from a fixed satellite altitude. Spatial quality metrics include measures of fit to the target pattern, 3dB contour size, side-lobe level, proportional weight within the 3dB contour, and weight beyond specified linear boundaries (e.g., X km from center)	acoustic lobing;algorithm design;end-to-end principle;fixed-satellite service;image resolution;image sensor;metric;microwave;multitier architecture;numerical analysis;numerical weather prediction;simulation;spatial analysis;spherical earth;testbed	John F.

In order to analyze soil nutrient differences among different land use types and their relationships between land uses, 9 sampling sites including 3 land uses were selected in the Daqiaohe catchment on Yunnan of China. Significant differences in soil nutrients among these land uses were found. Higher values of soil nutrient in crop land soil, but lower values in forest soil and virgin soil. Nutrient contents decreased with soil profile depth increasing. All nutrient contents were poor in debris flow bottomland. At the same time, relationship between nutrient contents and grade contents was analyzed. The result showed that TP, AP and AK were significantly correlated with clay contents and slit contents at 0.01 level, while other nutrients were not correlated with clay and slit contents. There existed significant relationship between TP and sand contents, but for TN, the condition was found. However, nutrient was relation to many factors, thus relationship between nutrient contents and grade contents should be studied in future.	sampling (signal processing);twisted nematic field effect	Qiuying Zhang;Fadong Li;Guoqiang Ou;Xianfang Song;Cong Yang	2005	Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, 2005.

The fifth-generation NCAR/Penn State Mesoscale Model, MM5, was used to forecast 79 storms spanning a year over Thailand and nearby regions at 5-km resolution. MM5 forecasted brightness temperatures and those coincidentally observed by the passive millimeter-wave Advanced Microwave Sounding Units (AMSU) aboard NOAA-16 satellite were compared. MM5-forecasted surface precipitation rate, peak vertical wind, and water paths for rainwater, snow, graupel, the sum of rainwater, snow, and graupel, cloud liquid water, and cloud ice were also compared with AMSU estimates. Results show that MM5 forecasts statistically agree with those observed by AMSU. MM5 over-forecast large ice particles for some storms. Morphology, intensity, and area of storms forecasted by MM5 are generally similar to AMSU observations, but with location differences. MM5 can provide useful high-resolution forecasts for tropical storms about 8 hours in advance. Forecast accuracy could be improved by using higher-resolution and more accurate initial and boundary conditions, satellite data for location correction during the forecast, and a more accurate weather prediction model.	automatic sounding;file spanning;image resolution;mm5 (weather model);mathematical morphology;microwave;tropical cyclone forecast model	Chinnawat Surussavadee	2011	2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049790	meteorology;image resolution;atmospheric sciences;tropical cyclone;climatology;predictive modelling;physics;remote sensing	Robotics	83.58305281367346	-61.8628709893751	61524

And in order to test the effects from the SST samples and the hidden knots of the RBF networks, the RMSEs are calculated with different number of hidden knots from 1 to 100 and various percentage of SST samples at 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 30%. The results from both the OISST experiments and the OSTIA experiments demonstrate that the accuracy of the RBF network-based SST models are effected by the number of hidden knots and SST samples and the distribution of the hidden knots. While too few and too many hidden knots and SST samples may make larger RMSE, but a more sparse distribution of hidden knots is contribute to SST modeling. The SST from the RBF network models are quite close to the original SST fields, and the minimal RMSE is 0.2842 °C for the OISST experiments and 0.2313 °C for the OSTIA experiments. However, some details of SST from the RBF network models are different to the original SST fields especially at the boundary between the high temperature and low temperature.	experiment;radial (radio);radial basis function network;sparse matrix	Zhihong Liao;Qing Dong;Cunjin Xue;Jingwu Bi;Shuchao Wu;Wanjiao Song	2016	2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730043	meteorology;sea surface temperature;geology;hydrology;climatology;mathematical model;remote sensing	Robotics	85.92378863612014	-62.24335718985702	61836

In this paper, in order to derive crop height, a gaussian decomposition algorithm based on transmitting waveform is adopted to distinguish the crop waveform from soil waveform, and to extract peak location and pulse width from raw waveform data, proving it is a reliable and highly accurate decomposition algorithm. Moreover, the decomposition algorithm lays the proper foundation for obtaining other crop biophysical parameters.	airborne ranger;algorithm;pulse-width modulation;superpose;transmitter;waveform	Mengwei Zhou;Qinhuo Liu;Qiang Liu;Qing Xiao;Bo Zhong	2010	2010 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5654143	lidar;geology;hydrology;remote sensing	Embedded	84.73458851415775	-62.413621173959186	62122

The model permits the investigation of historical grazing management under variable environmental conditions in Iceland through the prediction of spatial and temporal patterns of vegetation biomass and utilisation. Input parameters of the model are environmental, livestock and management variables from historical and archaeological sources. Process sub-models were constructed using contemporary Icelandic data. Validation of the model was based on an independent, published grazing experiment and demonstrated that Búmodel-predicted utilisable biomass values and biomass intake values fall within G1 standard deviation of observed values. Búmodel provides a validated representation of linkages between environmental and management elements in a historical grazing system. It incorporates key issues of spatial and temporal scale, data quality, model validation and the inherent stochasticity of landscape change over historical periods. In doing so, it enables researchers interested in past landscapes to investigate the flexibility of the historical Icelandic grazing systems within the constraints of climate and vegetation cover, and provides a framework and methodology that can be applied to other historical extensive livestock-based agricultural systems.

The Kazakhstan-wide LAI product has been retrieved using an algorithm based on a physical radiative transfer model establishing a relationship between LAI and given patterns of surface reflectance, view-illumination conditions and optical properties of vegetation at the per-pixel scale. The results revealed high consistencies between the produced AVHRR LAI data set and ground truth information and the 30-m resolution Landsat ETM+ LAI estimated using the similar algorithm. Differences in LAI between the AVHRR-based product and the Landsat ETM+-based product are lower than 0.4 LAI units in terms of RMSE. The produced Kazakhstan-wide LAI was also compared with the global 8-km AVHRR LAI (LAI_PAL_BU_V3) and 1-km MODIS LAI (MOD15A2 LAI) products. Results show remarkable consistency of the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics between the new LAI product and both examined global LAI products. However, the results also revealed several discrepancies in LAI estimates when comparing the global and the Kazakhstan-wide products. The discrepancies in LAI estimates were outlined and discussed.

f93b9b8df4191ef1c659912d507e599928fc0ccf	a data assimilation approach for simultaneously estimating a suite of land surface variables from satellite data		After over two decade of efforts, many land products are now being produced systematically from a variety of satellite data, and these products have been widely used. However, estimating a set of atmospheric and surface variables from one sensor data is often an ill-posed inversion problem, because the number of unknowns is often larger than the available bands[1]. Thus, one has to make assumptions while trying to obtain realistic solutions, and as a result, most products still need significant improvements of quality and accuracy. Although the average accuracy may be acceptable, the error of each product can be very large under certain conditions. Furthermore, different products of land variables from different inversion algorithms are physically inconsistent for most cases. Many products in the current form are not suitable for climate study because the products are not continuous both spatially and temporally due to factors such as clouds. There is an urgent need to develop more advanced new inversion methods and produce more accurate products. We have recently proposed a data assimilation approach to estimate an improved suite of products from one or multiple satellite data. The general idea is to use the surface and atmospheric radiation models with parameters that are adjusted to optimally reproduce the spectral radiance received by the EOS sensors. Such adjustments are usually made by identifying reasonably close “first guesses” for the model parameters and determining statistically optimum estimates of the parameters by giving appropriate weights to the first guesses versus addition to the error increments needed to get agreement with the observations. The first guesses are the multiple years MODIS/MISR land product climatologies. The best estimate at present time is a climatological value corrected by some combinations of previous time's departure from climatology weighted using temporal autocorrelation and what it takes to fit present observations. The presentation will review this approach and also introduce three case studies[2-4]. Case one [3] estimated only leaf area index (LAI) by integrating temporal, spectral, and angular information from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), SPOT/VEGETATION, and Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) data based on an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) technique. Validation results at six sites demonstrate that the combination of temporal information from multiple sensors, spectral information provided by red and near-infrared (NIR) bands, and angular information from MISR bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) data can provide a more accurate estimate of LAI than previously available. Case two [2] estimated temporally complete land-surface parameter profiles from MODIS time-series reflectance data also based on the EnKF technique. The products include LAI, the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) and surface broadband albedo. The LAI/FAPAR and surface albedo values estimated using this framework were compared with MODIS collection 5 eight-day 1-km LAI/FAPAR products (MOD15A2) and 500-m surface albedo product (MCD43A3), and GEOV1 LAI/FAPAR products at 1/112. spatial resolution and a ten-day frequency, respectively, and validated by ground measurement data from several sites with different vegetation types. The results demonstrate that this new data assimilation framework can estimate temporally complete land-surface parameter profiles from MODIS time-series reflectance data even if some of the reflectance data are contaminated by residual cloud or are missing and that the retrieved LAI, FAPAR, and surface albedo values are physically consistent. The root mean square errors of the retrieved LAI, FAPAR, and surface albedo against ground measurements are 0.5791, 0.0453, and 0.0190, respectively. Case three [4] further estimated multiple land surface parameters and aerosol optical depth (AOD) from MODIS top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance data without relying on atmospheric correction. Soil, vegetation canopy, and atmospheric radiative transfer models were coupled. LAI and AOD were estimated first and the coupled model then calculated land surface reflectance, incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), land surface albedo, and the FAPAR. The flowchart is shown in Fig. 1. The retrieved land surface parameters and AOD were compared with the corresponding MODIS, Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS), GEOV1, and MISR products and validated by ground measurements from seven sites with different vegetation types. The results demonstrated that the new inversion method can effectively produce multiple physically consistent parameters with accuracy comparable to that of existing satellite products over the select sites (Figure 2).	algorithm;angularjs;autocorrelation;data assimilation;eos;ensemble kalman filter;flowchart;inverse transform sampling;mean squared error;motorola canopy;sensor;temporal logic;time of arrival;time series;well-posed problem	Shunlin Liang;Zhiqiang Xiao;Hanyu Shi;Han Ma	2017	2017 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8127870	remote sensing;moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer;data assimilation;computer science;leaf area index;albedo;radiation;atmospheric model;atmospheric correction;spectroradiometer	Graphics	84.83188421799349	-62.11642600443737	63366

A combination of bottom-up and top-down eutrophication control measures has been implemented in both lakes since 1979. Dividing time-series data from 1976 to 1993 into three distinctive management periods has facilitated a comparative analysis of the two lakes regarding both the seasonal and long-term dynamics in response to eutrophication control. Results of the study have demonstrated that non-supervised ANN are an alternative technique: (1) to elucidate causal relationships of complex ecological processes, and (2) to reveal long-term behaviours of ecosystems in response to different management approaches. It has been shown that external nutrient control combined with food web manipulation have turned both lakes from nitrogen to phosphorus limitation, and from blue-green algae to diatom and green algae dominance.	artificial neural network	Friedrich Recknagel;Anita Talib;Diederik T. van der Molen	2006	Ecological Informatics	10.1016/j.ecoinf.2006.01.001	computer science;time series;top-down and bottom-up design;mathematics;ecology;artificial neural network;statistics	HCI	84.41124468820216	-54.72130656947133	63716

In particular, the backscattered signal statistics (in amplitude and phase) obtained in these two types of measurements are compared for different surface parameters (roughness and correlation length) and varying spatial resolutions in the SAR images. Experimental data have been taken in the European Microwave Signature Laboratory (EMSL) at JRC, an indoor facility which is able to measure extended targets both in scatterometric and linear SAR mode under the same conditions. The results confirm that, with spatial resolutions in the SAR image smaller than two autocorrelation lengths (ACL), the statistics of the backscattered signal depends significantly on the resolution cell size. For larger resolution cells, the experimental data are consistent with the Rayleigh model. This experimental finding substantially confirms the results based on numerical simulations, previously presented in the literature.	experiment	Giuseppe Nesti;Joaquim Fortuny-Guasch;Alois J.

We used Partial Least Squares regression to correlate the spectral reflectance between 350 and 2500 nm of all trees and leaves with mite damage. We tested nine published indices and normalized difference reflectance indices calculated from the most significant wavebands for correlation with mite damage. Significant bands appeared in the blue/near UV and red parts of the spectrum for both datasets. The most promising band combinations for predicting mite damage were 390 and 651 nm for canopies and 687 and 744 nm for leaves. Substantial scatter in the dataset and significant effects of sampling site and season will have to be overcome, before this technique can be applied in practice.	partial least squares regression;peach;sampling (signal processing);spider (solitaire)	Minghua Zhang;Adam Hale;Eike Luedeling	2008	IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4778859	decision support system;computer science;partial least squares regression;statistics;remote sensing	Embedded	83.33661541147644	-60.544584105613005	64082

The procedure has been developed to study the effect of the atmosphere in the remote sensing of the Earth, using aerospace imaging spectrometers. The simulation is run for a reference layered plane nonabsorbing atmosphere and a plane ground with uniform reflectance. For a given distribution of ground reflectance and for a specific profile of scattering and absorption properties of the atmosphere, the spectral response of the sensor is obtained in a short time from the results of the Monte Carlo simulation by using scaling relationships and symmetry properties. The procedure also includes an accurate analysis of the adjacency and trapping effects due to multiple scattering of photons coming from neighboring pixels. McCART can generate synthetic images of the Earth's surface for arbitrary viewing conditions. The results can be used to establish the limits of applicability of approximate algorithms for the processing and analysis of hyperspectral images acquired by imaging spectrometers. In addition, the algorithm can be used to develop procedures for atmospheric correction for the accurate retrieval of the spectral ground reflectance.	approximation algorithm;image scaling;monte carlo method;numerical analysis;pixel;simulation;software propagation;synthetic data	Vanni Nardino;Fabrizio Martelli;Piero Bruscaglioni;Giovanni Zaccanti;Samuele Del Bianco;Donatella Guzzi;Paolo Marcoionni;Ivan Pippi	2008	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2008.916464	meteorology;optics;physics;statistics;remote sensing;monte carlo method	Vision	83.09668733401249	-65.50356280912109	64746

Over the last decades, scientists have developed many models and algorithms to have a better determination of regional ET by remote sensing data. However, at regional scale, the field measured data and remote sensing data are inconsistent with each other due to the underlying surface heterogeneity. In this study, remotely sensed ET was carried out using Landsat ETM+ and MODIS data to understand the role of landscape heterogeneity and its influence on the scaling behavior of surface fluxes. This knowledge is very useful for correction of scale error of ET estimation, and can also be used to study the spatio-temporal effect of remotely sensed ET, which is going to be carried out in the future.	algorithm;image scaling;sensor	Yani Liu;Xiaozhou Xin;Qinhuo Liu	2008	IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779370	evapotranspiration;meteorology;transpiration;hydrology;evaporation;atmosphere;earth;water supply;china;physics;remote sensing	Embedded	84.81074562722934	-58.44408520962646	65533
6a61529bad56f1bcc1285dc55c02d1b5a39bb5b1	retrieval of effective leaf area index (laie) and leaf area density (lad) profile at individual tree level using high density multi-return airborne lidar	light detection and ranging lidar;static terrestrial laser scanning tls;leaf area density lad profile;unified cumulative lai uclai;effective lai laie;leaf area index lai	As an important canopy structure indicator, leaf area index (LAI) proved to be of considerable implications for forest ecosystem and ecological studies, and efficient techniques for accurate LAI acquisitions have long been highlighted. Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR), often termed as airborne laser scanning (ALS), once was extensively investigated for this task but showed limited performance due to its low sampling density. Now, ALS systems exhibit more competing capacities such as high density and multi-return sampling, and hence, people began to ask the questions like—“can ALS now work better on the task of LAI prediction?” As a re-examination, this study investigated the feasibility of LAI retrievals at the individual tree level based on high density and multi-return ALS, by directly considering the vertical distributions of laser points lying within each tree crown instead of by proposing feature variables such as quantiles involving laser point distribution modes at the plot level. The examination was operated in the case of four tree species (i.e. Picea abies, Pinus sylvestris, Populus tremula and Quercus robur) in a mixed forest, with their LAI-related reference data collected by using static terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). In light of the differences between ALSand TLS-based LAI characterizations, the methods of voxelization of 3D scattered laser points, effective LAI (LAIe) that does not distinguish branches from canopies and unified cumulative LAI (ucLAI) that is often used to characterize the vertical profiles of crown leaf area densities (LADs) was used; then, the relationships between the ALSand TLS-derived LAIes were determined, and so did ucLAIs. Tests indicated that the tree-level LAIes for the four tree species can be estimated based on the used airborne LiDAR (R2 = 0.07, 0.26, 0.43 and 0.21, respectively) and their ucLAIs can also be derived. Overall, this study has validated the usage of the contemporary high density multi-return airborne LiDARs for LAIe and LAD profile retrievals at the individual tree level, and the contribution are of high potential for advancing forest ecosystem modeling and ecological understanding. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

With the assistance of the 6S radiative transfer model, we simulated apparent reflectancein relation to AOD in each Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) waveband in this study. The closeness of the relationship was used to identify the most and least sensitive MODIS wavebands. These two bands were then used to construct three aerosol indices (difference, ratio, and normalized difference) for estimating AOD quickly and effectively. The three indices were correlated, respectively, with in situ measured AOD at the Aerosol Robotic NETwork (AERONET) Lake Taihu, Beijing, and Xianghe stations. It is found that apparent reflectance of the blue waveband (band 3) is the most sensitive to AOD while the mid-infrared wavelength (band 7) is the least sensitive. The difference aerosol index is the most accurate in indicating aerosol-induced atmospheric pollution with a correlation coefficient of 0.585, 0.860, 0.685, and 0.333 at the Lake Taihu station, 0.721, 0.839, 0.795, and 0.629 at the Beijing station, and 0.778, 0.782, 0.837, and 0.643 at the Xianghe station in spring, summer, autumn and OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2014, 6 1588 winter, respectively. It is concluded that the newly proposed difference aerosol index can be used effectively to study the level of aerosol-induced air pollution from MODIS satellite imagery with relative ease.	centrality;coefficient;frequency band	Junliang He;Yong Zha;Jiahua Zhang;Jay Gao	2014	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs6021587	meteorology;atmospheric sciences;remote sensing;air pollution	HCI	84.20754530044766	-59.77680149718127	66346

Two methods are used to predict shadow impact. The first method is based on traditional textbook “Clear Sky” equations, which have maximum sensitivity to shadows because every day is a perfect day. The second method uses measured global-horizontal and diffuse-horizontal solar radiation in units of W/m2, which take into account the true variety of daily conditions. The calculations are performed for 1 square meter surfaces, over the 1 square kilometer area, for every second of the day. For purposes of shadow calculations, the tip-top height (i.e., tower height plus blade length) is used.		Sahil Shanghavi;W.

In this paper, the shortwave radiative forcing of clouds and aerosols were estimated from Geostationary Meteorological Satellite (GMS) 5 data over China from 1998 to 2002, respectively. Such estimation is performed by a newly retrieval strategy based on radiative transfer model, which calculates shortwave cloud radiative forcing as the difference between downward solar radiation under all-sky and clear-sky, and shortwave aerosol direct radiative forcing as the difference between downward solar radiation under cloud-free sky with and without aerosol. Both instantaneous radiative forcing of cloud and aerosol were integrated to their daily mean radiative forcing, and then their annual spatial distribution can be derived. Based on them, this paper demonstrates changing patterns and processes of cloud and aerosol shortwave radiative forcing over China during those 5 years, analyses the role of cloud and aerosol that plays within each duration when downward solar radiation at surface changes. The analysis of overall radiative forcing of clouds and aerosols suggests that aerosol shortwave radiative forcing has increased by 32.8% (7.27W m−2) and cloud shortwave radiative forcing has decreased by 7% (4.81W m−2) for those 5 years. The impact of variability of aerosol shortwave radiative forcing has exceeded that of cloud shortwave radiative forcing, which led to the overall shortwave radiative forcing increased, thereby further decreased the downward solar radiation over China.	cloud computing;galileo (satellite navigation);globalization management system;spatial variability	Ning Lu;Ronggao Liu;Jiyuan Liu	2010	2010 18th International Conference on Geoinformatics	10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2010.5567995	meteorology;cloud forcing;atmospheric sciences;radiative forcing;geography;atmospheric radiative transfer codes;cloud feedback;remote sensing	HPC	84.16963519847519	-58.98419118553504	66728
f8e67e0a30b10cf12f99af3eac964b334e787255	urbanization and its impact on stormwa ter runoff potential using geospatial tools		Watershed management plays a dynamic role in water resource engineering. Divination and determination of surface runoff are the most important processes of hydrology as understanding the basic relationship between rainfall and runoff is effective for sustainable resource management. National Resources Conservation Service- Curve Number method is employed with geospatial tools to compute surface runoff. Temporal land use and soil maps are integrated in GIS environment to observe the temporal variation on the runoff potential. The study interprets, that the urbanization has increased 13.4 percent for 2001 to 2010 and 38.4 percent for 2010 to 2015 for which the weighted CN comes out to be 68.5, 67.4 and 68.6 for 2001, 2010 and 2015 respectively. Runoff depends upon the rainfall events which has definitely affected due to climate change. Thus, there is a high need to monitor and design storage tanks or to implement low impact development techniques to store stormwater and to reduce pressure from freshwater assets.	freshwater ecosystem;geographic information system;map;typset and runoff;watershed (image processing)	Shray Pathak;Chandra Shekhar Prasad Ojha;R.

491c0cb39632ea42023e38cbe89112d81d5ef25d	assessment of in-season cotton nitrogen status and lint yield prediction from unmanned aerial system imagery		The present work assessed the usefulness of a set of spectral indices obtained from an unmanned aerial system (UAS) for tracking spatial and temporal variability of nitrogen (N) status as well as for predicting lint yield in a commercial cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) farm. Organic, inorganic and a combination of both types of fertilizers were used to provide a range of eight N rates from 0 to 340 kg N ha−1. Multi-spectral images (reflectance in the blue, green, red, red edge and near infrared bands) were acquired on seven days throughout the season, from 62 to 169 days after sowing (DAS), and data were used to compute structureand chlorophyll-sensitive vegetation indices (VIs). Above-ground plant biomass was sampled at first flower, first cracked boll and maturity and total plant N concentration (N%) and N uptake determined. Lint yield was determined at harvest and the relationships with the VIs explored. Results showed that differences in plant N% and N uptake between treatments increased as the season progressed. Early in the season, when fertilizer applications can still have an effect on lint yield, the simplified canopy chlorophyll content index (SCCCI) was the index that best explained the variation in N uptake and plant N% between treatments. Around first cracked boll and maturity, the linear regression obtained for the relationships between the VIs and both plant N% and N uptake was statistically significant, with the highest r2 values obtained at maturity. The normalized difference red edge (NDRE) index, and SCCCI were generally the indices that best distinguished the treatments according to the N uptake and total plant N%. Treatments with the highest N rates (from 307 to 340 kg N ha−1) had lower normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) than treatments with 0 and 130 kg N ha−1 at the first measurement day (62 DAS), suggesting that factors other than fertilization N rate affected plant growth at this early stage of the crop. This fact affected the earliest date at which the structure-sensitive indices NDVI and the visible atmospherically resistant index (VARI) enabled yield prediction (97 DAS). A statistically significant linear regression was obtained for the relationships between SCCCI and NDRE with lint yield at 83 DAS. Overall, this study shows the practicality of using an UAS to monitor the spatial and temporal variability of cotton N status in commercial farms. It also illustrates the challenges of using multi-spectral information for fertilization recommendation in cotton at early stages of the crop.	aerial photography;capability maturity model;database normalization;digital camera;heart rate variability;lint (software);motorola canopy;requirement;sampling (signal processing);search engine indexing;sensor;spatial variability;unmanned aerial vehicle	Carlos Ballester;John Hornbuckle;James Brinkhoff;John Smith;Wendy Quayle	2017	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs9111149	remote sensing;geology;sowing;vegetation;canopy;normalized difference vegetation index;agroforestry;reflectivity;red edge	Crypto	84.62224389631282	-57.34200967615711	66935

Proton occurrence prediction model was created by classifying these inputs as relating to the occurrence or non occurrence. Models were verified by two years data and good prediction rates were demonstrated. A comparison was done between the prediction result of proton occurrence model and that of word warning agency (WWA).

In the present study, differences between satellite observations (Terra-MODIS) and atmospheric models' simulations are examined. The models are: the National Center for Environmental Protection/Department Of Energy (NCEP-DOE) reanalysis-2 data and the Nonhydrostatic ICosahedral Atmospheric Model (NICAM). The models' outputs (atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles) are used in this study to simulate the upper tropospheric brightness temperature (UTBT) and relative humidity (UTRH) at clear sky and low cloud areas. The results obtained show the contribution of atmospheric instability due to heat movements of the lower troposphere clear sky, cloud convection and low cloud radiative properties in the discrepancies between model and observation results. These differences tend to increase with the increase of the proportion of unstable pixels in the clear sky areas. Heat movements from cloud convection and low clouds examined through the convective clouds' distribution and the cloud effective emissivity respectively, show that cloud convection mostly affects the NICAM model results (existence of a positive correlation between the latter model error and the amount of convective clouds) and, discrepancies are stronger in broken clouds than continuous clouds.	atmospheric model;control theory;instability;nicam;pixel;plaintext;simulation	Jules Rostand Dim;Hiroshi Murakami;Tamio Takamura;Masahiro Hori;Takahashi Y.

From a comparative study, the calculated concentration distributions were more sensitive to a variation of the mixing height than to the changes of the diffusion coefficient values.

The measured materials included a branch sample from the subject tree, also known as the Smolensk birch, and stem analysis disk samples from silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) trees collected in central Poland. We analyzed and modeled the pith-to-bark and base-to-tip density changes in the silver birch samples, and using developed models estimated the subject tree trunk air-dry wood quality parameters and compared them with published yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis) and silver birch tabular data. Then we compared the corresponding surrogated green wood parameters of the subject tree against the standard American utility wood pole parameters, and identified environmental adjustments necessary for a realistic and accurate representation of the final subject tree wood characteristics. The final conclusions from this study are that the subject tree dry wood parameters are not significantly different (in the statistical sense) from the well-documented yellow birch parameters, which were used as their surrogate, and even without the due reductions in parameters for excessive amount of whorls and branches, and for the height of the tree break (5 to 7 m above ground), the structural parameters of the subject tree green wood, as applicable to live tree and as surrogated by appropriate yellow birch parameters, are generally weaker than corresponding dry wood parameters for the standard American wood poles and weaker then the southern yellow pine parameters.

cbefc0fb4fceee3d15a61e76ee2afd5b34a5862c	multiscale estimation of leaf area index from satellite observations based on an ensemble multiscale filter	leaf area index;retrieval;tm;ensemble multiscale filter;modis	Currently, multiple leaf area index (LAI) products retrieved from remote sensing data are widely used in crop growth monitoring, land-surface process simulation and studies of climate change. However, most LAI products are only retrieved from individual satellite observations, which may result in spatial-temporal discontinuities and low accuracy in these products. In this paper, a new method was developed to simultaneously retrieve multiscale LAI data from satellite observations with different spatial resolutions based on an ensemble multiscale filter (EnMsF). The LAI average values corresponding to the date of satellite observations were calculated from the multi-year Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI product and were used as a priori knowledge for LAI in order to construct an initial ensemble multiscale tree (EnMsT). Satellite observations obtained at different spatial resolutions were then applied to update the LAI values at each node of the EnMsT using a two-sweep filtering procedure. Next, the retrieved LAI values at the finest scale were used as a priori knowledge for LAI for the new round of construction and updating of the EnMsT, until the sum of the difference of LAI values at each node of the EnMsT between two adjacent updates is less than a given threshold. The method was tested using Thematic Mapper (TM) or Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) surface reflectance data and MODIS surface reflectance data from five sites that have different vegetation types. The results demonstrate that the retrieved LAI values for each spatial resolution were in good agreement with the aggregated LAI reference map values for the corresponding spatial resolution. The retrieved LAI values at the coarsest scale provided better accuracy with the aggregated LAI reference map values (root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.45) compared with that obtained from the MODIS LAI values (RMSE = 1.30).	mapper;map;mean squared error;motorola canopy;sensor;simulation;time series	Jingyi Jiang;Zhiqiang Xiao;Jindi Wang;Jinling Song	2016	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs8030229	meteorology;hydrology;leaf area index;remote sensing	AI	84.37139034952044	-60.36229847486174	67476

Most of the studies on GLAS waveforms have focused on natural forests and only a few were conducted over forest plantations. The objective of this study was to test the best known models used for estimating canopy height and above ground biomass of intensively managed Eucalyptus plantations in Brazil using full waveform LiDAR data. Studies to estimate forest heights from LiDAR data have highlighted that the fitting coefficients of developed models are strongly dependent on environmental factors such as the region of the study site, terrain topography, and forest type. In this study, we evaluated the main models developed to predict canopy height using a combination of parameters extracted from GLAS waveforms and a digital elevation model, in order to explore which combination of parameters yields the best forest height estimates. In addition, a model to estimate above ground biomass from dominant height was calibrated.	coefficient;digital elevation model;motorola canopy;star height;terrain rendering;topography;waveform	Nicolas Baghdadi;Guerric le Maire;Ibrahim Fayad;Jean-Stéphane Bailly;Yann Nouvellon;Cristiane Lemos;Rodrigo Hakamada	2014	2014 IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2014.6946526	hydrology;remote sensing	Robotics	85.08997304338284	-60.04725982308281	67554

In this study, we used a ground-based NDVI system to provide continuous time series analysis of individual shrub species and soil surface characteristics in two different semi-arid environmental settings located in the Great Basin (NV, USA). The NDVI system was a dual channel SKR-1800 radiometer that simultaneously measured incident solar radiation and upward reflectance in two broadband red and near-infrared channels comparable to Landsat-5 TM band 3 and band 4, respectively. The two study sites identified as Spring Valley 1 site (SV1) and Snake Valley 1 site (SNK1) were chosen for having different species composition, soil texture and percent canopy cover. NDVI time-series of greasewood (Sarcobatus vermiculatus) from the SV1 site allowed for clear distinction between the main phenological stages of the entire growing season during the period from January to November, 2007. NDVI time series values were significantly different between sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) and rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus) at SV1 as well as between the two bare soil types at the two sites. Greasewood NDVI from the SNK1 site produced significant correlations with chlorophyll index (r = 0.97), leaf area index (r = 0.98) and leaf xylem water potential (r = 0.93). Whereas OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2010, 2 991 greasewood NDVI from the SV1 site produced lower correlations (r = 0.89, r = 0.73), or non significant correlations (r = 0.32) with the same parameters, respectively. Total percent cover was estimated at 17.5% for SV1 and at 63% for SNK1. Results from this study indicated the potential capabilities of using this ground-based NDVI system to extract spatial and temporal details of soil and vegetation optical properties not possible with satellite derived NDVI.	advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer;cray sv1;motorola canopy;multi-channel memory architecture;nv network;persistent vegetative state;semiconductor industry;sparse matrix;time series	Malika Baghzouz;Dale A.

The conical scanner views at constant incidence angle and fixed polarizations, whereas the cross-track instrument scans across incidence angles with changing polarization. A model, based on radiative transfer calculations and Fresnel surface parameterization, successfully interrelated signals from the two radiometers as a function of T-2 scan angle for a significant fraction of the oceanic measurements. This confirmed the angular dependence model and provided a general relationship between 92-GHz SSM/T-2 and 85-GHz SSM/I signals, which is applicable in the absence of depolarization by rain, clouds, or severe sea surface roughness. Intercomparison between instruments, based on surface modeling, may be useful for instrumental calibration, it may assist in evaluation of microwave transmission models, and it does provide a validity test for ocean surface emissivity parameterization and cloud clearing procedures.	microwave	John E.

The transport modeling performed in this study demonstrates the joint use of remotely sensed multispectral imagery and mathematical modeling to assess the surface migration of contaminants. KINEROS, an event-driven model of surface runoff and sediment transport, was used to assess uranium transport for various rain events. The model inputs include parameters related to the size and slope of watershed components, vegetation, and soil conditions. One distinct set of model inputs was derived from remotely sensed imagery data and another from site-specific knowledge. To derive the parameters of the KINEROS model from remotely sensed data, classification analysis was performed on IKONOS four-band multispectral imagery of the watershed. A system known as GENIE, developed by Los Alamos National Laboratory, employs genetic algorithms to evolve classifiers based on small, user-selected training samples. The classification analysis derived by employing GENIE provided insight into the correct KINEROS parameters for various sub-elements of the watershed. The model results offer valuable information about portions of the watershed that contributed the most to contaminant transport. These methods are applicable to numerous sites where possible transport of waste materials poses an environmental risk. Because the approach rests on the analysis of remote sensing data, the techniques can be used to monitor inaccessible waste sites, as well as reduce the amount of data that would need to be collected for model calibration.	multispectral image	Naomi M.

7cc55c215154bbd3dee20396c1b510b7c1c82767	geographically weighted area-to-point regression kriging for spatial downscaling in remote sensing		Spatial downscaling of remotely sensed products is one of the main ways to obtain earth observations at fine resolution. Area-to-point (ATP) geostatistical techniques, in which regular fine grids of remote sensing products are regarded as points, have been applied widely for spatial downscaling. In spatial downscaling, it is common to use auxiliary information to explain some of the unknown spatial variation of the target geographic variable. Because of the ubiquitously spatial heterogeneities, the observed variables always exhibit uncontrolled variance. To overcome problems caused by local heterogeneity that cannot meet the stationarity requirement in ATP regression kriging, this paper proposes a hybrid spatial statistical method which incorporates geographically weighted regression and ATP kriging for spatial downscaling. The proposed geographically weighted ATP regression kriging (GWATPRK) combines fine spatial resolution auxiliary information and allows for non-stationarity in a downscaling model. The approach was verified using eight groups of four different 25 km-resolution surface soil moisture (SSM) remote sensing products to obtain 1 km SSM predictions in two experimental regions, in conjunction with the implementation of three benchmark methods. Analyses and comparisons of the different downscaled results showed GWATPRK obtained downscaled fine spatial resolution images with greater quality and an average loss with a root mean square error value of 17.5%. The analysis indicated the proposed method has high potential for spatial downscaling in remote sensing applications.	automated theorem proving;benchmark (computing);cosmic;cross-validation (statistics);downscaling;esa;guinness world records;kriging;mean squared error;spatial analysis;stationary process;uncontrolled format string	Yan Jin;Yong Ge;Jianghao Wang;Gerard B.

We studied the difference between ENVISAT and ICESat fluctuations over six years. We observed the same patterns between the leading edge width and the elevation difference. Both parameters are linked, and the major bias is due to the lengthening of the leading edge width due to the radar penetration. We show that the elevation difference between both altimeters and the leading edge width are linearly well-linked with a 0.8 Pearson correlation coefficient, whereas the slope effect over the coasts is difficult to analyze. When we analyze each crossover point temporal evolution locally, the linear correlation between the leading edge width and the elevation difference is between −0.6 and −1. Fitting a linear model between them, we find a reliability index greater than 0.7 for the Antarctic Plateau and Dronning Maud Land, which confirms that the penetration effect has a linear influence on the retrieved height. Moreover, we present results from SARAL/AltiKa (launched in February 2013) that confirm SARAL/AltiKa accuracy and the promising information it will provide.

A mass balance method was used to calculate P balance of both Yangzonghai lake watershed and the lake itself in one year. The imported P load was 725.1 t in 2010, while the exported P load was 317.3 t, which indicated that 56.2 % (407.8 t yr−1) of P was retained in the lake watershed. Such a high retention load implied that the lake, which was mesotrophic, was under great pressure of further eutrophication. Among all the input pathways, the largest P input contributor was fertilizer, contributing 679.0 t P and accounting for 93.6 % of input P, followed by atmospheric deposition (44.7 t P, 6.2 %). Plant product (264.6 t, 83.4 %) was the largest P output contributor, followed by animal products (50.2 t, 15.8 %).	watershed (image processing)	Shiyu Li;Bin Liu;Changliang Yang;Guiming Chen;Linna Yuan;Yangyu Song;Xiaomei Li;Deshou Cun;Shuang Hu	2015		10.1007/978-3-662-49155-3_72	phosphorus;eutrophication;fertilizer;deposition (aerosol physics);plant product;watershed;environmental science;hydrology	Robotics	85.90824473755082	-55.551970328425504	68724

The results show an RMSE of 3.3 m, 4.9 m, 12.8 m and 8.7 m for the four test areas respectively. Cartosat-1 DEM over these areas give an RMSE of 4.8 m, 7.9 m, 11.4 m and 8.7 m respectively. The height error also shows its dependence on slope. The difference between the DEMs obtained from the two techniques was also calculated for all the test sites in order to compare their accuracies. For all the test sites except Manali, an RMSE <; 4 m with 90% confidence level was observed between the two DEMs. The rugged terrain of Manali area is highly affected due to layover and shadow effect in TanDEM-X DEM and hence showed higher RMSE when compared with Cartosat-1 DEM. As both DEMs have spatial resolution and high accuracy, gaps in the TanDEM-X DEM may be filled with Cartosat-1 DEM.	digital elevation model;global positioning system;rugged computer;tandem computers;usgs dem	Rinki Deo;Minal Jain;Y.

To determine kinematics and strain distribution in this region, a GPS network of sixteen stations was established. We have used GPS velocity field data for southwest Anatolia from continuous measurements covering the period 2003 to 2006 to estimate current crustal deformation of this tectonically active region. GPS data were processed using GAMIT/GLOBK software and velocity and strain rate fields were estimated in the study area. The measurements showed velocities of 15-30 mm/yr toward the southwest and strain values up to 0.28-8.23×10(-8). Results showed that extension has been determined in the Burdur-Isparta region. In this study, all of strain data reveal an extensional neotectonic regime through the northeast edge of the Isparta Angle despite the previously reported compressional neotectonic regime. Meanwhile, results showed some small differences relatively with the 2006 model of Reilinger et al. As a result, active tectonic movements, in agreement with earthquake fault plane solutions showed important activity.	command & conquer:yuri's revenge;cutting-plane method;global positioning system;gray platelet syndrome;least-angle regression;movement;regional positioning and timing system (turkey);sixteen;velocity (software development)	Saffet Erdogan;Muhammed Sahin;Ibrahim Tiryakioglu;Engin Gülal;Ali Kazim Telli	2009		10.3390/s90302017	text mining;global positioning system;computer science;bioinformatics;strain	HCI	87.93862817599823	-59.042376258504554	69079

In developing countries migration to urban areas is continuing at an increasing rate. Detection and analysis of settlement patterns, estimating population, and monitoring population migration in a timely manner are requisite to accurately assess the impact of human activities on the environment. Monitoring urban land use change patterns is among the most critical information needs for future economic development planning, natural resource allocation, and environmental and ecosystem management. Previous research has demonstrated the potential of imaging radar systems in analyzing urban, population, and settlement phenomena. However, the variability and complexity within and between urban land use morphologies present a convoluted environment for analysis. Studies of vegetation, soils, geology, hydrology, and ice and snow have all received more attention and been the subject of considerably more widespread and in-depth radar research. Nevertheless, imaging radars offer some distinct advantages and opportunities for urban-based research. With the arrival of operational space imaging SAR systems, a review of the current status of applications of radar remote sensing in urban studies should be useful for focusing the authors' attention on this important area of radar research and identification of specific problems for in-depth analysis. This paper traces the history of imaging radar research for urban, settlement, and population analysis. It presents a status report on the applications of SAR in settlement detection, population estimation, assessment of the impact of human activities on the physical environment, mapping and analyzing urban land use patterns, and interpretation of socioeconomic characteristics. The demonstrated capabilities and limitations of past and current imaging radar systems with reference to these applications are described. Potential avenues of future research are addressed.	pattern recognition	Floyd M. Henderson;Zong-Guo Xia	1997	IEEE Trans.

Firstly, the empirical inversion algorithm of ocean transparency was developed with the in-situ measured Secchi depth and remote-sensing reflectance. Then the ocean transparency over the Northwestern Pacific was produced with the constructed model and the data of MODIS/Terra and VIIRS/NPP. Finally, the objective analysis method was applied to merge the above ocean transparency product. The merged product is evaluated from the spatial coverage ratio and the accuracy of the result. The evaluation result showed that the spatial coverage of Objective Analysis method products is much larger than that of the single sensor products. Compared with the operational product from GlobColour website, our result is acceptable. The objective analysis merging method can be used widely without timeliness requirement.	algorithm;image resolution;sensor	Yingni Shi;Tinglu Zhang;Lin Tian;Lijian Shi	2014	2014 IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2014.6947455	meteorology;oceanography;remote sensing	Embedded	83.59880222100689	-61.17786869970704	69713

The comparison has been carried out by considering both the cloud mask and the intermediate levels such as the brightness temperatures and the reflectance values for different channels from which the cloud mask is derived. The preliminary analysis indicates a general good agreement among the different sources. A main underestimation of cloud cover is present on the sea and especially for high thin clouds. First results indicate that in order to increase the cloud cover accuracy the threshold for the intermediate levels (brightness temperature and reflectance values) may be changed by taking into account also the cloud vertical profiles.	algorithm;aqua;sensor	Daniela Di Rosa;Claudia Notarnicola;Francesco Posa	2009	2009 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2009.5417951	meteorology;snow;radiometry;atmospheric sciences;data validation;atmosphere;reflectivity;earth;software testing;cloud cover;brightness temperature;cloud top;physics;cloud fraction;remote sensing	Visualization	82.97688193425118	-61.914671458504344	69804

In this study, a procedure is presented to extract and characterize simultaneous temporal changes in MODIS multivariate times series from three surface state variables the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), land surface temperature (LST) and albedo (ALB). The analysis involves conducting a seasonal trend analysis (STA) to extract three seasonal shape parameters (Amplitude 0, Amplitude 1 and Amplitude 2) and using principal component analysis (PCA) to contrast trends in change and no-change areas. We illustrate the method by characterizing trends in burned and unburned pixels in Alaska over the 2001–2009 time period. Findings show consistent and meaningful extraction of temporal patterns related to fire disturbances. The first principal component (PC1) is characterized by a decrease in mean NDVI (Amplitude 0) with a concurrent increase in albedo (the mean and the annual amplitude) and an increase in LST annual variability (Amplitude 1). These results provide systematic empirical evidence of surface changes associated with one type of land change, fire disturbances, and suggest that STA with PCA may be used to characterize many OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2014, 6 12640 other types of land transitions over large landscape areas using multivariate Earth observation time series.	pixel;principal component analysis;spatial variability;surface states;time series	Benoit Parmentier	2014	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs61212639	meteorology;astronomy;normalized difference vegetation index;hydrology;fire;physics;albedo;remote sensing	ML	83.11686399171066	-57.213291132760396	69932

Though the inversion of a physically based canopy reflectance model using high-resolution satellite data can produce high-resolution LAI products, the obstacle to producing temporal products is obvious due to the low temporal resolution of high resolution satellite data. A feasible method is to combine different source data, taking advantage of the spatial and temporal resolution of different sensors. In this paper, a high-resolution LAI retrieval method was implemented using a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) inversion framework. MODIS LAI data with higher temporal resolution were used to fit the temporal background information, which is then updated by new, higher resolution data, herein ASTER data. The interactions between the different resolution data were analyzed from a Bayesian perspective. The proposed method was evaluated using a dataset collected in the HiWater (Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research) experiment. The determination coefficient and RMSE between the estimated and measured LAI are 0.80 and OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2015, 7 196 0.43, respectively. The research results suggest that even though the coarse-resolution background information differs from the high-resolution satellite observations, a satisfactory estimation result for the temporal high-resolution LAI can be produced using the accumulated information from both the new observations and background information.	coefficient;dynamic bayesian network;experiment;image resolution;interaction;motorola canopy;sensor;source data;watershed (image processing)	Yonghua Qu;Wenchao Han;Mingguo Ma	2015	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs70100195	uncertainty analysis;hydrology;machine learning;leaf area index;dynamic bayesian network;remote sensing	AI	84.24627123152199	-60.324391545795706	71132

2d022e682abfbabfd1058815ecb788555763da5d	developing an integrated remote sensing based biodiversity index for predicting animal species richness		Many remote sensing metrics have been applied in large-scale animal species monitoring and conservation. However, the capabilities of these metrics have not been well compared and assessed. In this study, we investigated the correlation of 21 remote sensing metrics in three categories with the global species richness of three different animal classes using several statistical methods. As a result, we developed a new index by integrating several highly correlated metrics. Of the 21 remote sensing metrics analyzed, evapotranspiration (ET) had the greatest impact on species richness on a global scale (explained variance: 52%). The metrics with a high explained variance on the global scale were mainly in the energy/productivity category. The metrics in the texture category exhibited higher correlation with species richness at regional scales. We found that radiance and temperature had a larger impact on the distribution of bird richness, compared to their impacts on the distributions of both amphibians and mammals. Three machine learning models (i.e., support vector machine, random forests, and neural networks) were evaluated for metric integration, and the random forest model showed the best performance. Our newly developed index exhibited a 0.7 explained variance for the three animal classes’ species richness on a global scale, with an explained variance that was 20% higher than any of the univariate metrics.	artificial neural network;biodiversity informatics;ecosystem;experiment;graph partition;machine learning;multistage interconnection networks;radio frequency;random forest;support vector machine	Jinhui Wu;Shunlin Liang	2018	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs10050739	remote sensing;support vector machine;evapotranspiration;artificial neural network;geology;biodiversity;species richness;random forest;explained variation;univariate	AI	84.59137587839463	-55.743162997700225	71391

The objective of the mission is to provide exploratory global measurements of the earth's soil moisture at 10-km resolution with two- to three-days revisit and land-surface freeze/thaw conditions at 3-km resolution with one- to two-days revisit. The mission builds on the heritage of ground-based and airborne passive and active low-frequency microwave measurements that have demonstrated and validated the effectiveness of the measurements and associated algorithms for estimating the amount and phase (frozen or thawed) of surface soil moisture. The mission data will enable advances in weather and climate prediction and in mapping processes that link the water, energy, and carbon cycles. The Hydros instrument is a combined radar and radiometer system operating at 1.26 GHz (with VV, HH, and HV polarizations) and 1.41 GHz (with H, V, and U polarizations), respectively. The radar and the radiometer share the aperture of a 6-m antenna with a look-angle of 39/spl deg/ with respect to nadir. The lightweight deployable mesh antenna is rotated at 14.6 rpm to provide a constant look-angle scan across a swath width of 1000 km. The wide swath provides global coverage that meet the revisit requirements. The radiometer measurements allow retrieval of soil moisture in diverse (nonforested) landscapes with a resolution of 40 km. The radar measurements allow the retrieval of soil moisture at relatively high resolution (3 km). The mission includes combined radar/radiometer data products that will use the synergy of the two sensors to deliver enhanced-quality 10-km resolution soil moisture estimates. In this paper, the science requirements and their traceability to the instrument design are outlined. A review of the underlying measurement physics and key instrument performance parameters are also presented.	airborne ranger;algorithm;communications satellite;earth system science partnership;image resolution;java pathfinder;logic level;microwave;numerical weather prediction;radar;requirement;sensor;synergy;traceability;verification and validation	Dara Entekhabi;Eni G.

Hence, it is urgent to assess the expansion risk of IPS in regions of high plant diversity and their potentially negative effects throughout the world. We used the worldu0027s 36 worst IPS as focal study species and applied species distribution modeling to project the suitable habitat distributions of these IPS in centers of plant diversity at the global scale. Subsequently, we assessed the expansion risk of IPS based on habitat suitability across biomes and nature reserves. We found that IPS, particularly Chromolaena odorata , Eichhornia crassipes , Leucaena leucocephala , and Mimosa pigra , have high expansion potential in Tropical u0026 Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests, Tropical u0026 Subtropical Dry Broadleaf Forests, and Mangroves within global regions of high plant diversity. Furthermore, IPS such as Imperata cylindrica and L. leucocephala may expand dramatically into Vulnerable and Critical or Endangered biome areas, including nature reserves across Tropical u0026 Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests and Tropical u0026 Subtropical Coniferous Forests. We suggest that effective conservation management should be enhanced in order to reduce the expansion risk of IPS in the Vulnerable and Critical or Endangered biome areas, that temperature changes should be carefully monitored, and that conservation policies of nature reserves should be reviewed, particularly regarding IPS with high potential to naturally disperse into the nature reserves.

The time series ranges from May 5th 2010 to July 11th 2010, covering much of the growing season and the seasonal changes in vegetation reflectance. Atmospheric correction of the time series was done with Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH) and ATmospheric CORrection (ATCOR) algorithms for comparison. Both algorithms performed well with Hyperion imagery. Different red edge inflection point (REIP) calculation methods were analyzed to determine their applicability for Hyperion imagery. REIP was calculated using four-point interpolation, Lagrangian interpolation, and fifth order polynomial fitting. Due to the dynamics of the red edge, polynomial fitting was seen as the best method for calculating the REIP. REIP did not correlate strongly with Leaf Area Index (LAI) but a stronger correlation was observed with understory REIP.	algorithm;execution unit;fo (complexity);hyperion;interpolation;lagrange polynomial;polynomial interpolation;preprocessor;time series	Veli-Heikki Vesanto;Matti Mottus;Janne Heiskanen;Miina Rautiainen;Titta Majasalmi	2012	2012 4th Workshop on Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing (WHISPERS)	10.1109/WHISPERS.2012.6874307	meteorology;geography;optics;remote sensing	Vision	84.13180641302127	-60.7666908909886	72000

It has been constructed by the United States Department of Energy (DOE) in semiarid, sparsely inhabited rangeland in southeastern New Mexico. The disposal area is 655 m below the land surface, in bedded salt of the Late Permian (approximately 255 million-years-old) Salado Formation. The extremely low permeability of the halite and other evaporite rocks provide the primary geologic barrier assuring long-term (10,000-year-plus) isolation of the radioactive waste from the accessible environment. Extensive geologic investigations during site characterization have provided information on the stratigraphy, structure, and natural resources of the region (including hydrocarbons, potash, and groundwater), and have investigated the potential for disruption by processes such as dissolution, salt deformation, tectonic activity, and climate change. Hydrogeologic investigations have documented the physical properties of the evaporite rocks, and have identified the Culebra Dolomite Member of the overlying Rustler Formation as the most transmissive water-bearing unit in the region. If the evaporite barriers are breached by accidental drilling intrusion, the Culebra would provide the most likely pathway for radionuclide transport away from the site. Although water in the Culebra is of poor quality and none is currently used for human consumption, groundwater flow and potential radionuclide transport in the unit have been studied in detail. Results of geologic and hydrogeologic studies of the WIPP region indicate that the geologic and hydrogeologic features of the site will provide effective long-term containment of radionuclides. Geologic and hydrogeologic information is used in the performance assessment that supported the DOE’s compliance certification application to the United States Environmental Protection Agency.

Atmospheric water vapor is a source of clouds, rains and snows, and the distribution and amount play important roles for a representation of latent heat releases and absorptions in NWP model. Numerous moisture observations are required to produce accurate and realistic analyses and forecasts in the data assimilation. In this paper, a retrieval algorithm of atmospheric water vapor for AMSR-E and results of the product verification and comparison are presented. In addition, some NWP experiment results in JMA Meso-Scale Model data assimilation system are shown as an application example of this algorithm.	algorithm;data assimilation;initial condition;mesoscopic physics;numerical weather prediction;typhoon	Masahiro Kazumori;Takumu Egawa	2010	2010 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5651480	meteorology;algorithm design;atmospheric model;sea surface temperature;snow;data assimilation;typhoon;atmospheric sciences;weather forecasting;climatology;water vapor;numerical weather prediction;latent heat;initial value problem;physics	Embedded	86.58733921799008	-63.65489426205989	72558

Hyperspectral field measurements were performed and spectral sampling of three commonly used sensors (Landsat-5 TM, SPOT5 and IKONOS) as well as the one for the future ESA Sentinel-2 satellite was simulated. LAI was retrieved with a radiative transfer model (RTM) based LUT inversion and two (semi-) empirical approaches using NDVI and WDVI. Surface albedo estimation was compared between the traditional weighting coefficient method and RTM simulation. LAI could be best estimated using the LUT approach based on the Sentinel-2 sensor configuration (RMSE = 0.59). For surface albedo, the physical model achieved the more realistic results compared to field measurements with a net radiometer. Results are discussed in view of operational monitoring applications for agriculture.	coefficient;esa;pleiades (supercomputer);sampling (signal processing);sensor;simulation	Katja Richter;Francesco Vuolo;Guido D'Urso	2008	IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779453	meteorology;hydrology;hyperspectral imaging;physics;remote sensing	Robotics	83.91705528159312	-62.00229070309059	72761

The first methodology used here is the change in regime technique that relies on dividing the observations into two states, one for clear days and other for non-clear days depending on the duration of the sunshine. Then, for each state, the trend component is expressed as a Fourier series and the stochastic component as an ARMA model. The second methodology used is the transfer function model which depends on two same behavior and highly correlated series such as sunshine duration and daily global radiation. The sunshine duration is considered as an independent input series whereas the global radiation series as the dependent output series. A comparison is made between the two proposed models based on Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC), the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and the coefficient of determination (R). 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Explanation of such a behavior of the cross-polarized microwave radar from a theoretical standpoint represents a challenge. A classical composite Bragg (CB) theory significantly underestimates the level of measured cross-polarized radar return for all ranges of winds. Our study based on the small-slope approximation of the second order (SSA2) improves an agreement between the theory and the experiment for intermediate range of winds. The SSA2, as contrasted with the CB, always accounts for Bragg scattering of the second order which involves intermediate waves propagating at zero grazing angles (Wood's anomaly). Explanation of the cross-polarization scatterometric data at high winds would require going beyond the SSA2. One of the possible mechanisms could be breaking waves playing a role of retro-reflectors.	anomaly detection;approximation;microwave;polarization (waves);radar;van der pol oscillator;verification and validation	Alexander G.

Optimal photosynthetic function is negatively affected by stress factors that cause down-regulation (i.e., reduced rate of photosynthesis). Present approaches to determine ecosystem carbon exchange rely on meteorological data as inputs to models that predict the relative photosynthetic function in response to environmental conditions inducing stress (e.g., drought, high/low temperatures). This study examines the determination of ecosystem photosynthetic light use efficiency (LUE) from satellite observations, through measurement of vegetation spectral reflectance changes associated with physiologic stress responses exhibited by photosynthetic pigments. This novel approach is now possible because the Moderate-Resolution Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Aqua and Terra provides frequent, narrow-band measurements of high radiometric accuracy in both the morning and afternoon. Specifically, the reflective ocean MODIS bands were used to calculate the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI), an index that is sensitive to reflectance changes near 531 nm associated with vegetation stress responses exhibited by photosynthetic pigments in the xanthophyll cycle. MODIS PRI values were compared with LUE calculated from half hour values of CO2 flux measured at the overpass time at a mature aspen site in the boreal forest of Saskatchewan as part of the Fluxnet-Canada network	aqua;carbon cycle;ecosystem;inverted index;terrestrial television	Elizabeth M.

As human impact on the environment becomes more pronounced, there is growing interest in understanding the effects of environmental and scocio-economic changes on landscape dynamics. Computer simulation models provide a tool for studying the causes and consequences of landscape dynamics and projecting short- and long-term landscape changes. Currently, there is a need for a model that can simulate multiple drivers of land cover change, including natural disturbances vegetation succession along with anthropogenic effects such land use transitions and land management practices. The available land cover change models typically simulate only a subset of these disturbances, which is not sufficient for realistically simulating land cover change over large heterogeneous areas. To addressing this need, we developed a novel simulator that combines two existing modeling frameworks: human-driven land use change (derived from the FORE-SCE model) with natural disturbances and vegetation dynamics (derived from the LADS model) and will incorporate novel feedbacks between human land use and natural disturbance regimes. The simulator is a raster-based, spatially explicit, stochastic computer model that combines a demand-allocation land use change model, a state-and transition for natural vegetation dynamics, and spatially explicit fire initiation and spread. The simulator is being designed to incorporate the effects of climate change, land management, and human demand on resource on land use over and natural vegetation dynamics to provide realistic, high resolution, and scenario-based land cover products. The simulator is a stand-alone program written in Visual C++ environment for use in Microsoft Windows Operating System environment, and in continuous development. This poster highlights the conceptual and technical design of the model integration.	c++;computer simulation;feedback;image resolution;interaction;knowledge management;microsoft windows;operating system;raster graphics;scalable cluster environment;succession	Aashis Lamsal;Zhifeng Liu;Michael C.

f7a06fbb918159c799a726b95a998de17803c3b6	simulation of water use efficiency to tackle the drought		Rainfed environments are characterised by unpredictable and highly variable seasonal rainfall and hence highly variable yields. Water use efficiency (WUE, yield per unit of water use) is commonly used for agricultural production with limited water resources. Expertise working towards the water resources need to address the multitudinous aspects in which cropping systems and amounts, timing and methods of irrigation, and fertilizer applications may be changed to improve WUE while maintaining yield and harvest quality goals. Since experimentation cannot address all scenarios accurate simulation models may fill in the gaps. Crop simulation models are used widely to predict crop growth and development in studies of the impact of climatic change. The present paper explains the model for WUE for an underutilised crop, bambara groundnut under drought as a sub-module of BAMGRO main model (Karunaratne, 2009). This quantitative model explains the root growth, root distribution and water uptake on daily basis under variable climatic conditions. The model links the size and distribution of root system to the capture of water over the growing period. The model was calibrated using glasshouse experimental data, Nottingham, UK and published information. It was validated against 2 years of independent data sets (2007, 2008) from Nottingham and field site at Notwane, Botswana. Although the limited information on root growth is available, validation of soil moisture against glass house and field reported satisfactory results.	simulation;wue	Asha Karunaratne;Neil Crout	2010		10.7148/2010-0316-0322	water resource management;agroforestry	AI	86.07591484990536	-56.897025105868636	73488
fab3da9906cb6f9e7bbe23d9d0d6e24df150650e	linear multi-task learning for predicting soil properties using field spectroscopy		Field spectroscopy has been suggested to be an efficient method for predicting soil properties using quantitative mathematical models in a rapid and non-destructive manner. Traditional multivariate regression algorithms usually regard the modeling of each soil property as a single task, which means only one response variable is considered as the output during modeling. Therefore, these algorithms are less suitable for the prediction of several key soil properties with low concentrations or unobvious spectral absorption signals. In the current study, we investigated the performance of a linear multi-task learning (LMTL) algorithm based on a regularized dirty model for modeling and predicting several key soil properties using field spectroscopy (350–2500 nm) as an integrated approach. We tested seven key soil properties including available nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), pH, water content (WC), organic matter (OM), and electrical conductivity (EC) in drylands. The model performances of LMTL models were compared with the commonly used single-task algorithm of the partial least squares regression (PLS-R). Our results show that the LMTL models outperformed the PLS-R models with the advantage of shared features; the ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) values in the validation set improved by 10.24%, 4.93%, 25.77%, 11.76%, 6.74%, 53.13%, and 3.15% for N, P, K, pH, WC, OM, and EC, respectively. The best prediction was obtained for OM with RPD = 2.29, indicating high accuracy (RPD > 2). The prediction results of N, P, WC, and pH were categorized as of moderate accuracy (1.4 < RPD < 2), while K and EC were categorized as of poor accuracy (RPD < 1.4). However, the explanatory power of the LMTL models was moderate due to fewer features being selected by the regularization algorithm of the LMTL approach, which should be further studied in the soil spectral analysis. Our results highlight the use of LMTL in field spectroscopy analysis that can improve the generalization performance of regression models for predicting soil properties.	algorithm;categorization;coefficient;computer multitasking;emoticon;field electron emission;futures studies;general linear model;mathematical model;multi-task learning;partial least squares regression;performance;sparse matrix;writing commons	Haijun Qi;Tarin Paz-Kagan;Arnon Karnieli;Shaowen Li	2017	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs9111099	geology;remote sensing;regression analysis;spectroscopy;partial least squares regression;water content;multivariate statistics;multi-task learning	AI	86.18062050899705	-62.555252861057234	73807
5c1f007c7f43b25de7c0ad10975e97cd7cda1e10	retrieval of forest aboveground biomass and stem volume with airborne scanning lidar	forest inventory;aboveground biomass;nearest neighbour;laser scanning	Airborne scanning LiDAR is a promising technique for efficient and accurate biomass mapping due to its capacity for direct measurement of the three-dimensional structure of vegetation. A combination of individual tree detection (ITD) and an area-based approach (ABA) introduced in Vastaranta et al. [1] to map forest aboveground biomass (AGB) and stem volume (VOL) was investigated. The main objective of this study was to test the usability and accuracy of LiDAR in biomass mapping. The nearest neighbour method was used in the ABA imputations and the accuracy of the biomass estimation was evaluated in the Finland, where single tree-level biomass models are available. The relative root-mean-squared errors (RMSEs) in plot-level AGB and VOL imputation were 24.9% OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2013, 5 2258 and 26.4% when field measurements were used in training the ABA. When ITD measurements were used in training, the respective accuracies ranged between 28.5%–34.9% and 29.2%–34.0%. Overall, the results show that accurate plot-level AGB estimates can be achieved with the ABA. The reduction of bias in ABA estimates in AGB and VOL was encouraging when visually corrected ITD (ITDvisual) was used in training. We conclude that it is not feasible to use ITDvisual in wall-to-wall forest biomass inventory, but it could provide a cost-efficient application for acquiring training data for ABA in forest biomass mapping.	aba problem;airborne ranger;cost efficiency;geo-imputation;inventory;national lidar dataset;usability	Ville Kankare;Mikko Vastaranta;Markus Holopainen;Minna Räty;Xiaowei Yu;Juha Hyyppä;Hannu Hyyppä;Petteri Alho;Risto Viitala	2013	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs5052257	laser scanning;forest inventory;optics;ecology;physics;remote sensing	HCI	83.26666308364416	-60.23720268581171	74053
e33bd0a5172db88f3326fabd5771766ac31eb306	comparison of spatial interpolation and regression analysis models for an estimation of monthly near surface air temperature in china		Near surface air temperature (NSAT) is a primary descriptor of terrestrial environmental conditions. In recent decades, many efforts have been made to develop various methods for obtaining spatially continuous NSAT from gauge or station observations. This study compared three spatial interpolation (i.e., Kriging, Spline, and Inversion Distance Weighting (IDW)) and two regression analysis (i.e., Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR)) models for predicting monthly minimum, mean, and maximum NSAT in China, a domain with a large area, complex topography, and highly variable station density. This was conducted for a period of 12 months of 2010. The accuracy of the GWR model is better than the MLR model with an improvement of about 3 ◦C in the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which indicates that the GWR model is more suitable for predicting monthly NSAT than the MLR model over a large scale. For three spatial interpolation models, the RMSEs of the predicted monthly NSAT are greater in the warmer months, and the mean RMSEs of the predicted monthly mean NSAT for 12 months in 2010 are 1.56 ◦C for the Kriging model, 1.74 ◦C for the IDW model, and 2.39 ◦C for the Spline model, respectively. The GWR model is better than the Kriging model in the warmer months, while the Kriging model is superior to the GWR model in the colder months. The total precision of the GWR model is slightly higher than the Kriging model. The assessment result indicated that the higher standard deviation and the lower mean of NSAT from sample data would be associated with a better performance of predicting monthly NSAT using spatial interpolation models.	data descriptor;guinness world records;investigative data warehouse;kriging;learning to rank;mean squared error;multivariate interpolation;spatial analysis;spline (mathematics);terrestrial television;topography	Mengmeng Wang;Guojin He;Zhaoming Zhang;Guizhou Wang;Zhengjia Zhang;Xiaojie Cao;Zhijie Wu;Xiuguo Liu	2017	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs9121278	statistics;regression analysis;geology;remote sensing;linear regression;standard deviation;multivariate interpolation;kriging;mean squared error;spline (mathematics);weighting	ML	85.35922020766725	-60.06078070602183	74101

Water production functions (WPFs), mathematical relationships between applied water and crop yield, are useful tools for irrigation management and economic analysis of yield reduction due to deficit irrigation. This study aimed at (i) designing and evaluating site-specific WPFs (using k nearest neighbors (k-NN), multiple linear regression, and neural networks), (ii) simulating yield maps for uniform, sector control VRI, and zone control VRI center pivot systems using the site-specific WPFs, (iii) using the best WPF to investigate different cotton irrigation and zoning strategies using integer linear programming, and (iv) comparing soil-based and WPF-based zones for sector control VRI systems. A two-year cotton irrigation experiment (2013–2014) was implemented to study irrigation-cotton lint yield relationship across different soil types. The site-specific k-NN WPFs showed the highest performance with root mean square error equal to 0.131 Mg ha 1 and 0.194 Mg ha 1 in 2013 and 2014, respectively. The result indicated that variable rate irrigation with limited sector control capability could enhance cotton lint yield under supplemental irrigation when field-level spatial soil heterogeneity is significant. The temporal changes in climate and rainfall patterns, however, had a great impact on cotton response to irrigation in west Tennessee, a moderately humid region with short season environment. We believe sitespecific WPFs are useful empirical tools for on-farm irrigation research. 2016 Elsevier B.V.

f297399d99b5d4894e846e6c52a796cd81115352	groundwater arsenic contamination and land subsidence in hanoi city, vietnam		Groundwater Arsenic (As) contamination in three groundwater tables (Holocene (qh), Pleistocene (qp<inf>2–3</inf>), and Pleistocene (qp<inf>1</inf>)) was examined by using 300, 423, and 204 samples in qh, qp<inf>2–3</inf>, and qp<inf>1</inf>, respectively, in Hanoi City in 2000–2003. Land subsidence was derived from JERS-1 images in 1995–1998, and Envisat-ASAR from Jan to April in 2004. Results show that Arsenic was lower in surface water and wastewater than groundwater. Also, Arsenic in groundwater was lower near surface (qh) than far from surface (qp<inf>2–3</inf> and qp<inf>1</inf>). Land subsidence was significant in downtown areas where large and medium groundwater supply stations are located. Spatial correlation between Arsenic in qh, qp<inf>2–3</inf>, and qp<inf>1</inf> and land subsidence indicates more subsidence was observed in regions with higher Arsenic contamination. Such findings support the hypothesis that increasing groundwater abstraction results in enhancing oxygenation to boost redox reaction to release Arsenic from ore into groundwater.	spin contamination;wario land: shake it!

The radiometric and spectral accuracy of IS data is known to be highly influenced by such effects, which prevents consistent comparison of products. Several models were developed to approximate surface reflectance anisotropy for multi-angular observations. Few studies were carried out using such models for airborne flight lines where only a single observation is available for each ground location. In the present work, we quantified and corrected reflectance anisotropy on a single airborne HyMap flight line using a Ross-Li model. We stratified the surface in two vegetation structural types (different in vertical structuring) using spectral angle mapping, to generate a structure dependent set of angular observations. We then derived a suite of products [indices (structure insensitive pigment index, normalized difference vegetation index, simple ratio index, and anthocyanin reflectance index) and inversion-based (SAIL/PROSPECT-leaf area index, Cw, Cdm, Cab)] from corrected and uncorrected images. Non-parametric analysis of variance (Kruskal-Wallis test) showed throughout significant improvements in products from corrected images. Data correction resulting in airborne nadir BRDF adjusted reflectance (aNBAR) showed uncertainty reductions from 60 to 100% (p-value = 0.05) as compared to uncorrected and nadir observations. Using sparse IS data acquisitions, the use of fully parametrized BRDF models is limited. Our normalization scheme is straightforward and can be applied with illumination and observation geometry being the only a priori information. We recommend aNBAR generation to precede any higher level airborne IS product generation based on reflectance data.	airborne ranger;angularjs;approximation algorithm;bidirectional reflectance distribution function;hymap;kruskal's algorithm;lambertian reflectance;metric;oren–nayar reflectance model;pigment;sparse matrix;structuring element	Jorg Weyermann;Alexander Damm;Mathias Kneubühler;Michael E.

We first verify that the GMRES-RP method has the desirable features of high accuracy, robustness, and efficiency, and, hence, is well suited to such analysis. We then carry out this analysis systematically by examining the effects of wind speed, incidence angle, ocean spectrum, and the degree of inclusion of the gravity and intermediate waves. With a large surface length of 16384 λ and a noise floor pushed down below -70 dB, we have found more refined structures than suggested in the literature: At near-normal incidence angle (θi=20°), both VV and HH results remain sensitive to wind speed. Across the incidence angle range, the sensitivity is higher at small wind speed than at medium to high wind speed. Plant argued that the contribution from intermediate waves separately, not as a part of the large wave spectrum, becomes increasingly important with increasing wind speed and, accordingly, a multiscale model is desired. Our numerical analysis validates this viewpoint by showing that a normalized bistatic scattering coefficient value as large as 4 dB at certain angles for H-pol at L band can be attributed to the intermediate wave and the tilt modulation provided by large waves. The viewpoint is further validated by a comparison of the two-scale model and three-scale model against numerical results where the two-scale model shows appreciable discrepancy in the forward scattering angles whereas the three scale model shows very good agreement with MoM, hence manifesting the necessity of advancing multiscale models beyond the conventional two-scale model. This finding also implies the need for numerical studies to use adequately large surface length, at least to cover the intermediate waves, even for below intermediate incidence cases.	approximation;coefficient;discrepancy function;extrapolation;generalized minimal residual method;incidence matrix;interaction;l band;modulation;multiscale modeling;noise floor;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;rp (complexity);rough set;spectral density;verification and validation	Hejia Luo;Guangdi Yang;Yinhui Wang;Jiancheng Shi;Yang Du	2014	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2013.2257800	meteorology;wind wave;geodesy;numerical analysis;gravitational wave;preconditioner;optics;physics;quantum mechanics;wind	Visualization	83.58567705474634	-66.73903504821006	75295

We respond to questions posed by land managers with: (1) comparison of airborne and ground-based electromagnetic surveys in the Lower Balonne catchment, Queensland, and (2) comparison with historical and anecdotal knowledge of landscape response in the country around Jamestown in mid-South Australia. In the Lower Balonne, direct comparison between ground electromagnetic survey (EM) and airborne electromagnetics (AEM) showed a strong relationship for both the absolute values and spatial patterns of conductivity. The penetration of AEM to greater than 100 m is valuable in defining hydrological barriers. In the Jamestown area, AEM conductivity corresponded well with specific outbreaks of salinity and observed variability in crop response; local inconsistencies at the ground surface could be resolved when sub-surface data were considered. AEM can provide valuable information at the field scale that is relevant to salinity management. Farmers can have confidence in any of these techniques (historical information, EM and AEM) and they may directly compare or integrate the results. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The algorithm is a simplification of the distorted Born model. It takes into account the physical scattering phenomenon and has three major components: volume, double-bounce and surface. This simplified model uses the three backscattering coefficients (σHH, σHV and σVV) at low-frequency (P-band). The inversion process uses the Levenberg-Marquardt non-linear least-squares method to estimate the structural parameters. The estimation process is entirely explained in this paper, from initialization of the unknowns to retrievals. A sensitivity analysis is also done where the initial values in the inversion process are varying randomly. The results show that the inversion process is not really sensitive to initial values and a major part of the retrievals has a root-mean-square error lower than 5% for soil moisture, 24 Mg/ha for biomass and 0.49 cm for roughness, considering a soil moisture of 40%, roughness equal to 3cm and biomass varying from 0 to 500 Mg/ha with a mean of 161 Mg/ha.	coefficient;least squares;level of detail;levenberg–marquardt algorithm;mean squared error;nonlinear system;polarimetry;randomness;semiconductor industry	My-Linh Truong-Loï;Sassan Saatchi;Sermsak Jaruwatanadilok	2012	2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6352452	inversion;meteorology;synthetic aperture radar;polarimetry;surface roughness;water content;biomass;hydrology;optics;sensitivity analysis;backscatter;physics;remote sensing	Vision	85.99829646369159	-61.94689244258468	75464

We propose an alternative, data centric, approach that relies on actual measurements of climate observations and human and natural forcing factors. Specifically, we develop a novel method to infer causality from spatial-temporal data, as well as a procedure to incorporate extreme value modeling into our method in order to address the attribution of extreme climate events, such as heatwaves. Our experimental results on a real world dataset indicate that changes in temperature are not solely accounted for by solar radiance, but attributed more significantly to CO2 and other greenhouse gases. Combined with extreme value modeling, we also show that there has been a significant increase in the intensity of extreme temperatures, and that such changes in extreme temperature are also attributable to greenhouse gases. These preliminary results suggest that our approach can offer a useful alternative to the simulation-based approach to climate modeling and attribution, and provide valuable insights from a fresh perspective.	causality;chaos theory;climate model;maxima and minima;simulation;stability of the solar system	Aurelie C.

A model, used to predict spatial variation in wind erosion and deposition is a useful tool in the implementation of wind erosion control measures in the Sahel. The aim of this paper was to test two existing wind erosion models on spatial predictions of aeolian mass transport for Sahelian conditions. Field data from Burkina Faso were used to test an empirical (RWEQ) and a deterministic (WEPS) model.#R##N##R##N#The revised wind erosion equation (RWEQ) poorly predicted maximum mass transport and so spatial predictions of mass transport were underestimated. Major constraints of RWEQ for application in the Sahel were the required non-eroding boundary and the fact that RWEQ assumes a more or less homogeneous field. It was concluded that RWEQ in its current state was not suitable for application in a Sahelian environment.#R##N##R##N#With the correct roughness length (Z0), wind erosion prediction system (WEPS) correctly predicted friction velocity and initiation and cessation of mass transport. Furthermore, the model gave a reasonable prediction of the spatial distribution of mass transport at the research sites. It was concluded that WEPS in PCRaster is suitable for prediction of wind erosion in a Sahelian environment. A constraint of WEPS in PCRaster is that WEPS' predictions of spatial variation in sediment transport are closely linked to the spatial variation in the input parameters. A good estimation of the spatial variation of the input parameters was required. Obtaining these might be an expensive exercise and could make its use in the Sahel difficult.		Saskia M.

The results indicate runoff recorded exhibited slight decrease trend from 1961 to 2004, but there is a notable decrease trend of runoff since 1990. It is noteworthy that low stream continued 15 years from 1990 to 2004, besides 1993 and 1999. Moreover, 9 year amount of runoff anomalous percentage below − 30% among 13 years of the low runoff years, account for 69%, contrast to 6.5% from 1736 to 1998. The paper has discussed the cause of the persistent low flow in the upper reaches of Yellow River in recent years based on the data of general circulation of atmosphere, sea-surface temperature(SST), sensible heat flux over Tibetan Plateau, precipitation, temperature, wind speed, sunshine time, amount of evaporation and maximum depth of frozen ground since 1990. The main cause is showed to be persistent low precipitation since 1990, which may be caused by NAOI maintained positive height phase in winter, East Asian big trough leaning depth, West Pacific Ocean subtropical high pressure ridge line position near southerly, greater sensible heat flux in spring and summer over Tibetan Plateau and stronger geothermal fields that easily result in a kind of typical Northwest drought circulation of 500hPa south positive and north negative, west positive and east negative, weak north wind and strong west wind, and deep East Asian trough and strong Xinjiang ridge in summer in East Asian. Secondarily, the reduction of rainy days above 5 mm and steady rainy days, higher temperature and larger evaporation in spring and summer is disadvantageous to create runoff. The results also indicate that the drought of the surface in the basin resulted in the decreasing trend of the runoff.	evaporation;plateau effect;surface-mount technology;typset and runoff	Jianying Feng;Yaohui Li;Chunmei Liao;Jinsong Wang	2011	2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049254	meteorology;sea surface temperature;geology;hydrology;climatology;physics	Embedded	83.33723177340028	-56.98036062643398	75722

Fire risk and behavior depend on the fuel properties such as moisture content. Context information on vegetation water content is vital for understanding the processes involved in initiation and propagation of forest fires. In that sense, a novel method was tested to estimate vegetation canopy water content (CWC) from simulated MODIS satellite data. An inversion of a radiative transfer model called Forest Light Interaction-Model (FLIM) from performed using evolutionary computation. CWC is critical, among other applications, in wildfire risk assessment since a decrease in CWC causes higher probability to have wildfire occurrence. Simulations were carried out with the FLIM model for a wide range of forest canopy characteristics and CWC values. A 50 subsample of the simulations was used for the training process and 50 for the validation providing a RMSE=0.74 and r2=0.62. Further research is needed to apply this method on real MODIS images.	evolutionary computation	Luis Usero Aragonés;Angel Arroyo;J.

Microwave synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data has been proved to have a great potential for rice monitoring and parameters retrieval. In this study, a rice canopy scattering model (RCSM) was revised and then was applied to simulate the backscatter of rice canopy. The combination of RCSM and genetic algorithm (GA) was proposed for retrieving two important rice parameters relating to grain yield, ear length and ear number density, from a C-band, dual-polarization (HH and HV) Radarsat-2 SAR data. The stability of retrieved results of GA inversion was also evaluated by changing various parameter configurations.#R##N##R##N#Results show that RCSM can effectively simulate backscattering coefficients of rice canopy at HH and HV mode with an error of <1 dB. Reasonable selection of GA’s parameters is essential for stability and efficiency of rice parameter retrieval. Two rice parameters are retrieved by the proposed RCSM-GA technology with better accuracy. The rice ear length are estimated with error of <1.5 cm, and ear number density with error of <23 #/m2. Rice grain yields are effectively estimated and mapped by the retrieved ear length and number density via a simple yield regression equation. This study further illustrates the capability of C-band Radarsat-2 SAR data on retrieval of rice ear parameters and the practicability of radar remote sensing technology for operational yield estimation.	genetic algorithm;motorola canopy	Yuan Zhang;Bin Yang;Xiaohui Liu;Cuizhen Wang	2017	Int.

Land-use change analysis is very important for land planning and environment management in the Loess Plateau of China. The combined use of satellite remote sensing and geographical information systems (GIS) has become one of the important tools to study land-use change because they are more convenient and less time consuming compared to actual field studies. The human activities have significantly changed the distribution and allocation of land resources in Shenmu County over the last 14 years due to rehabilitation measures. In this paper, firstly we collected data of land use from TM image using supervised classification method with remote sensing software ERDAS. Then calculated the transition matrix of land use with the GIS software-ArcGIS; at last, analyzed the changes of landscape metrics using the landscape structure analysis program FRAGSTATS. The objectives of the present study were to determine land-use transition rates among land-use types in Shenmu County over 14 years from 1986-2000 and to quantify the changes of various landscape metrics. The results show the remarkable decrease in barren land mainly was due to conversion to grassland. Significant changes in agricultural landscape occurred within the area. The landscape has become more continuous, clumpy and homogeneous. The critical situation of severe desertification in the area has been gradually improved through the measures to combat it.	arcgis;carbon cycle;environmental resource management;geographic information system;machine learning;stochastic matrix;supervised learning	Bin Wen;Mingan Shao	2005	Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, 2005.

As with any system, it is important to understand which subcomponents are most important and which are less important so that appropriate resource allocations may be made. An example of a complex system is the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Its subsystems include the satellite vehicle, the precipitation radar (PR), the ground validation system, and the retrieval algorithms. Each of these subsystems contributes to the overall success of the mission. Sensitivity analysis (SA) is a method whereby the output response from a model can be linked back to the variability in the input parameters. This paper describes a method of performing SA on a TRMM PR-like (TL) rainfall retrieval algorithm (based on the TRMM 2A25 algorithm) to better describe how the uncertainty in the model output can be apportioned to the uncertainty in the input factors and gain greater understanding as to the relative importance of each factor. For example, assuming a model with several input factors, if one factor is found to be the dominating cause of model error, and the others contribute relatively little, then resources can be devoted to improving the accuracy of one factor, thereby improving the overall model accuracy. This paper is based on global SA using a variance decomposition technique. Analyses are done and results are presented for factor importance for cases over both ocean and land. Results for the simple TL algorithm considered in this paper show that at low rain rate, the a and b coefficients in the R=aZe b relationship contribute the greatest amount to the output variance. At higher rain rates, above about 8 mm/h, the error from Deltasigmadeg is the greatest contributor to error in algorithm output	algorithm;coefficient;complex system;qr decomposition;radar;spatial variability;systems engineering;transform, clipping, and lighting	Chris R.

Forest canopy height as a main factor in forest biomass estimation is costly and time consuming to be measured on the ground. This study aims to estimate Lorey's height “H<sub>lorey</sub>” using GLAS data based on regression models. Different metrics like waveform extent “W<sub>ext</sub>”, trail-edge extent “Htrail” and lead-edge extent “H<sub>lead</sub>” were extracted from waveforms and a terrain index “TI” was also calculated using a digital elevation model. H<sub>lorey</sub> estimated using multiple regression models were compared to field measurements data. A 5-fold cross validation method was used to validate the results. Best model with lowest AIC (297.440) was resulted using combination of W<sub>ext</sub> and TI (R<sub>a</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.72; RMSE= 5.04m). The results show capability of ICESat-GLAS to estimate Lorey's height in sloped area with a simple regression model. It is prospected to reach better result using other statistical methods and also improvement of processing techniques for LiDAR waveforms in the case of sloped terrain.	akaike information criterion;best practice;cross-validation (statistics);digital elevation model;motorola canopy;star height;waveform	Manizheh Rajab Pourrahmati;Nicolas Baghdadi;Ali Asghar Darvishsefat;Manouchehr Namiranian;Valéry Gond;Jean-Stéphane Bailly	2015	2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326728	lidar;database index;estimation;biomass;hydrology;physics;vegetation;measurement;remote sensing	Robotics	85.31510790225681	-60.179504892608755	76476

We identify the properties of ground surfaces in thermal infrared regions as Lambertian surfaces via field experiments. Because Lambertian surfaces present homogeneous thermal emissions levels in hemispheric directions for a specific ground surface under specific kinetic temperatures and emissions, we conducted a series of field experiments to illustrate the properties of such ground surfaces. Four typical ground surfaces were selected for the experiments to observe thermal emissions: bare soil, grass, water, and concrete. Radiance thermometers were used to observe ground emissions from seven directions: 30◦, 45◦, 60◦, 90◦, 120◦, 135◦, and 150◦. Solar zenith angles were considered for the observation of ground emissions. Experiments were conducted in five different regions of China (Beijing, Nanjing, Xilinguole, Yongzhou, and Jiangmen) during both daytime and nighttime. To determine whether different observation angles have significantly different effects on radiance, statistical analyses (ANOVA and Friedman test) were conducted. Post hoc multiple comparison tests and pairwise multiple comparisons were also conducted to examine the various pairings of observation angles and to measure the radiance differences. Roughly half of the radiance groups of all observed sites were tested via an ANOVA, and the remaining groups with unequal variances were subjected to the Friedman test. The results indicate that statistically significant differences in the radiance levels occurred among the seven angles for almost all of the sites (39 of the 40 groups). The results of our experiments indicate that the selected ground surfaces, especially the grass and the bare soil, may not behave with Lambertian properties in the thermal infrared region. This is probably attributed to the roughness of the selected surface, because we found that roughness is an important factor affecting the observed magnitude of thermal emission from different directions of the ground surface under study. Therefore, whether or not a terrestrial surface can be assumed to be a Lambertian surface should be based on their geometric structure. When the surface is relatively smooth, we can say that it is close to the Lambertian property in thermal emission.	experiment;hoc (programming language);lambertian reflectance;terrestrial television;thermal grease	Lili Tu;Zhihao Qin;Lechan Yang;Fei Wang;Jun Geng;Shuhe Zhao	2017	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs9050481	meteorology;optics;remote sensing	HCI	83.8837211210705	-65.62615066387262	76981

There is a long history of soil salinity accumulation. The transportation and the spatial distribution of soil salinity are associated with the fluctuation of groundwater table. With the decline of groundwater table level from 0.5-3.0 m below the surface at 1960 to 15-35 m in 2004 induced by excessive extraction of groundwater, the transportation and spatial distribution of soil salinity in the profiles has changed, bringing the transformation of salinizational land in Minqin Basin. In this paper, field observation and four Landsat TM satellite images taken over a span of 14 years (1987 - 2000) are employed to determine changes of saline land by means of the techniques of Standard image enhancements, classifications, principal component. The analysis of TM images shows that the areal extent of soil salinization in the Minqin basin has been shrunk by 29.95% from 1987 to 2000 due to the decline of groundwater level. The fields observation data describing the spatial distribution of soil salinity in the profiles from 1960's to 2000 were used to verify the results. The soil salinity content in the top 10 centimeters has reduced from 0.35-0.918% in the early 1960's to less than 0.3% in late 1980's. Up to now, the higher accumulation layers of salinity transported downward to 60-80 cm below the surface and the salinity-concentrating layer has moved from the top 10 cm to 60-80 cm below the surface.	principal component analysis;quantum fluctuation;salineos;tree accumulation;watershed (image processing)	E Youhao;Jihe Wang;Yan Ping;Han hui;Zhang Dekui	2007	2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423514	geomorphology;geology;hydrology;remote sensing;principal component analysis	Vision	82.91523035257774	-56.71913848367672	77191

Similar to using X-ray to carry out human-body CT scans, the microwave signals of low earth and/or medium earth orbit satellites are proposed for carrying out 3D (Three Dimensional) rainfall tomography in this paper. The proposed method will not only complement the three major rain measurement methods in use today (i.e. rain gauge, weather radar, and weather satellite) but also potentially achieve 3D rainfall measurements with precision and coverage unachievable before. Along with the deployment of low earth orbit satellite constellations (e.g. the OneWeb constellation) for global broadband Internet services, small satellite receivers of the size of a pizza box may be used to achieve 3D rainfall tomography anywhere on the Earth, thereby paving the way for many practical applications and atmospheric research that are associated with rainfall.	ct scan;microwave;pizza box form factor;rain fade;set-top box;software deployment;tomography	Defeng Huang;Lu Xu;Xuxiang Feng;Wanyu Wang	2016	Journal of Communications and Information Networks	10.1007/BF03391552	meteorology;hydrology;remote sensing	Metrics	85.29782691447436	-64.5363306647623	77823

The popular half-angle cosine WSF always fails to describe observed HFR Doppler spectra and tends to provide almost fixed relative angle estimations. In this letter, analysis of the data from a broad-beam HFR radar, deployed on the Taiwan Strait’s west coast, shows that a modified WSF (based on the cosine WSF) has a better wind-direction estimation performance. The modified WSF fits average Bragg ratios of 15-day data well with the aid of data from buoys. The data of the next 13 days are used to test the modified WSF. The wind direction estimated by the modified WSF has an advantage when Bragg ratios have adequate average processing, and directions of arrival are around the upwind or downwind direction. The root mean square error of the modified WSF wind-direction estimate is 32.59° for the entire observation, decreasing to 14.18° when a significant wave height is between 1 and 2 m.	discrete cosine transform;doppler effect;fits;first-order predicate;id-wsf;lambert's cosine law;mean squared error;operability;radar;upwind scheme	Yuming Zeng;Hao Zhou;Yeping Lai;Biyang Wen	2018	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2018.2809558	remote sensing;geodesy;mathematics;radar;doppler effect;doppler radar;significant wave height;wind speed;wind direction;inversion (meteorology);mean squared error	Mobile	84.98617650258626	-63.132490780758715	78189

Monte Carlo simulation results are presented for scattering at L-band (λ = 0.24 m). For homogeneous soils with rough surfaces, the results of FEM are compared with the predictions of the small perturbation method. In the case of heterogeneous substrates, soil moisture (and, hence, soil permittivity) is assumed to vary as a function of depth. In this case, the results of FEM are compared with those of the transfer matrix method for flat soil surfaces. In both cases, a good agreement is found. For homogeneous rough soils, it is found that polarimetric radar backscatter and copolarized phase difference have a nonlinear relationship with soil moisture. Finally, it is found that the nature of the soil moisture variation in the top few centimeters of the soil has a strong influence on the backscatter and, hence, on the inferred soil moisture content.	backscatter (email);computation;finite element method;l band;matrix method;monte carlo method;nonlinear system;polarimetry;radar;rough set;simulation;transfer matrix	Uday K.

This study focuses on estimating the evapotranspiration and crop coefficients of table grapes vineyards trained on overhead “tendone” systems in the Apulia region (Italy). Maximum vineyard transpiration was estimated by adopting the “direct” methodology for ETp proposed by the Food and Agriculture Organization in Irrigation and Drainage Paper No. 56, with crop parameters estimated from Landsat 8 and RapidEye satellite data in combination with ground-based meteorological data. The modeling results of two growing seasons (2013 and 2014) indicated that canopy growth, seasonal and 10-day sums evapotranspiration values were strictly related to thermal requirements and rainfall events. The estimated values of mean seasonal daily evapotranspiration ranged between 4.2 and 4.1 mm·d, while midseason estimated values of crop coefficients ranged from 0.88 to 0.93 in 2013, and 1.02 to 1.04 in 2014, respectively. The experimental evapotranspiration values calculated represent the maximum value in absence of stress, so the resulting crop coefficients should be used with some caution. It is concluded that the retrieval of crop parameters and OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2015, 7 14709 evapotranspiration derived from remotely-sensed data could be helpful for downscaling to the field the local weather conditions and agronomic practices and thus may be the basis for supporting grape growers and irrigation managers.	coefficient;downscaling;motorola canopy;overhead (computing);requirement	Silvia Vanino;Giuseppe Pulighe;Pasquale Nino;Carlo De Michele;Salvatore Falanga Bolognesi;Guido D'Urso	2015	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs71114708	evapotranspiration;hydrology;crop coefficient;leaf area index;remote sensing	HCI	84.52337302068908	-58.05063646733724	79006

However, the variations in carbon flux and ET in wetland are not yet fully understood. Zhangye wetland is an oasis-desert wetland with complex meteorological conditions. In this study, we used eddy covariance technology and process-based to examine the characteristics of carbon flux and ET over an artificial wetland in an oasis-desert area. The main objectives were to determine that (1) is it a carbon sink or source during the study period? (2) is there a significant relationship between the simulation using Biome-BGC model (Wetland-BGC version) and observation? The results showed that (1) it was a carbon sink in non-growing season in Zhangye wetland, whereas it was a carbon pool during the growing season; and CH4 flux influenced the total carbon budget significantly; (2) the relationship between observation and simulation was higher than 0.6 (GPP, Reco and ET), but it was 0.3065 on NEE.	carbon cycle;ecosystem;graph partition;simulation;terrestrial television	Qiang Zhang;Rui Sun	2016	2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730773	carbon;meteorology;wetland;hydrology;carbon dioxide;soil science	Arch	84.98759919195798	-57.95146374897002	79112

In order to validate the ability of AFX to indicate land surface anisotropy, the relations between AFX and BRDF shapes of several typical land cover types are described in this paper. Besides, we compare the values of prototype inversion algorithm based on AFX with the original full inversion algorithm. Finally, we study relations between AFX and LAI with the simulation data of the two-layer canopy reflectance model of KUUSK to apply AFX, which may guide future research of retrieving the vegetation parameters.	afx windows rootkit 2003;algorithm;bidirectional reflectance distribution function;kernel (operating system);motorola canopy;oren–nayar reflectance model;prototype;semiconductor industry;simulation	Xiaoning Zhang;Ziti Jiao;Yang Li;Yadong Dong;Dongni Bai	2015	2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326176	meteorology;data modeling;kernel;shape;hydrology;reflectivity;scattering;physics;remote sensing	Embedded	85.43711670952881	-61.75246091036802	79523
9c2fa6031c23449c27b5938485e9337574934f9f	3d modeling of uranium-bearing solution-collapse breccias in proterozoic sandstones (athabasca basin, canada) - metallogenic interpretations	3d modeling;uranium deposit;athabasca basin;shear zone;conceptual model;breccia;3d model;first order;spatial correlation;saturated hydraulic conductivity;fluid rock ratio;structural geology	Unconformity-related uranium deposits are the highest grade, large tonnage uranium resources in the world. In the Athabasca Basin (northern Saskatchewan, Canada), which is the premier host for unconformity-type deposits, the ore deposits are frequently hosted and surrounded by breccias in sandstone. The significance of these breccias and their relation to mineralization are of major importance for the genesis of these high-grade deposits. Therefore, a modeling study, integrating results from structural geology and petrology, was performed with the gOcad 3D modeling software, in order to decipher geometrical and geological relationships between breccias, faults and mineralization zones. Mineralized bodies and the sudoite–dravite breccia bodies display strong spatial correlations. They appear to be controlled by reverse shear zones cross-cutting the unconformity and containing graphite in the basement. Geochemical computations evidenced that volumetric water–rock ratios up to 10,000 could be obtained in these breccia bodies for volume losses of up to 90%. Assuming reasonable values for quartz saturation, hydraulic conductivity and connected porosity, the minimal fluid volume and the time duration necessary to generate the sudoite–dravite breccia bodies were estimated at ca. 2 km and ca. 1Myr, respectively. The comparison of these results with literature data suggests that the formation of sudoite–dravite breccia and mineralization could have been coeval. It may be proposed that within the space created by the quartz dissolution in the breccia body, a mixing between basement and basinal fluids could have induced U deposition and allowed the development of high-grade mineralization. The first-order uranium solubility that this coeval formation would imply is consistent with literature data, which suggests that this conceptual model is reasonable. r 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Information on the absolute and relative amounts of anthocyanins allows evaluating the physiological conditions of plants and their responses to stress and has the potential for evaluating plant species diversity across broad geographic regions. As anthocyanins absorb radiation in the green region of the electromagnetic spectrum (with a peak of absorption at around 540-560 nm), broadband vegetation indices that use this spectral region in their formulation will exhibit sensitivity to their presence. In this letter, we evaluate the sensitivity of four broadband vegetation indices using reflectance in the green spectral region to foliar anthocyanin content. Among the indices tested, the visible atmospherically resistant vegetation index was found to be closely and linearly related to the relative amount of foliar anthocyanin across five different species (the root-mean-square error of the prediction is ca. 0.1, and the relative error is below 20%). While this result was obtained at leaf level, it opens new possibilities for analyzing anthocyanin content and composition across multiple scales by means of spacecraft-mounted broadband sensor systems such as Landsat Thematic Mapper, Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer.	approximation error;circa	Andrés Viña;Anatoly A.

The dihedral corner reflector is a basic model of double-bounce structure in urban area. The detailed scattering information serves the interpretation of Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (POLSAR) data analysis. The Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method is utilized for the scattering calculation because of its simplicity and flexibility in the target shape modeling. This paper points out that there exists a stable double-bounce squint angle region both for perfect electric conductor (PEC) and dielectric comer reflectors. Beyond this stable squint angular region, the scattering characteristics become completely different from the assumed response. A criterion on the double-bounce scattering is proposed based on the physical optics (PO) approximation. The detailed analyses on the polarimetric index (copolarization ratio) with respect to squint angle and an experimental result measured in an anechoic chamber are shown.

ed5c5bcf9c03c671d6cd49c4f9b7a05f92a82dc2	a pragmatic bayesian approach to wind field retrieval	computer science pattern recognition systems pattern perception image processing signal processing information theory meteorology climatology	The ERS-1 Satellite was launched in July 1991 by the European Space Agency into a polar orbit at about 800 km, carrying a C-band scatterometer. A scatterometer measures the amount of backscatter microwave radiation reflected by small ripples on the ocean surface induced by sea-surface winds, and so provides instantaneous snap-shots of wind flow over large areas of the ocean surface, known as wind fields. Inherent in the physics of the observation process is an ambiguity in wind direction; the scatterometer cannot distinguish if the wind is blowing toward or away from the sensor device. This ambiguity implies that there is a one-to-many mapping between scatterometer data and wind direction. Current operational methods for wind field retrieval are based on the retrieval of wind vectors from satellite scatterometer data, followed by a disambiguation and filtering process that is reliant on numerical weather prediction models. The wind vectors are retrieved by the local inversion of a forward model, mapping scatterometer observations to wind vectors, and minimising a cost function in scatterometer measurement space. This thesis applies a pragmatic Bayesian solution to the problem. The likelihood is a combination of conditional probability distributions for the local wind vectors given the scatterometer data. The prior distribution is a vector Gaussian process that provides the geophysical consistency for the wind field. The wind vectors are retrieved directly from the scatterometer data by using mixture density networks, a principled method to model multi-modal conditional probability density functions. The complexity of the mapping and the structure of the conditional probability density function are investigated. A hybrid mixture density network, that incorporates the knowledge that the conditional probability distribution of the observation process is predominantly bi-modal, is developed. The optimal model, which generalises across a swathe of scatterometer readings, is better on key performance measures than the current operational model. Wind field retrieval is approached from three perspectives. The first is a non-autonomous method that confirms the validity of the model by retrieving the correct wind field 99% of the time from a test set of 575 wind fields. The second technique takes the maximum a posteriori probability wind field retrieved from the posterior distribution as the prediction. For the third technique, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques were employed to estimate the mass associated with significant modes of the posterior distribution, and make predictions based on the mode with the greatest mass associated with it. General methods for sampling from multi-modal distributions were benchmarked against a specific MCMC transition kernel designed for this problem. It was shown that the general methods were unsuitable for this application due to computational expense. On a test set of 100 wind fields the MAP estimate correctly retrieved 72 wind fields, whilst the sampling method correctly retrieved 73 wind fields.		David J.

The data must be validated under different scenarios of biophysical and climatic conditions. For the current study, the data from January to December 2010 from 20 in situ soil moisture stations from the REMEDHUS soil moisture measurement station network (Spain) were used. A comparison analysis was carried out in terms of the soil moisture content, its spatial variability, and temporal stability. The results show an acceptable level of agreement (R = 0.73, RMSD = 0.069 m3 · m-3, and bias = 0.053 m3 · m-3) between the in situ and satellite data. A slight constant underestimation from the SMOS data set was detected. A centered (bias removed) root-mean-square difference was calculated to account for this persistent bias (RMSDc = 0.044 m3 · m-3). This result is close to the SMOS accuracy objective of 0.04 m3 · m-3. Two conclusions can be drawn: First, SMOS is close to meet the mission accuracy requirements in REMEDHUS, and second, SMOS is able to detect temporal anomalies and the temporal evolution of ground soil moisture, even though the soil moisture was slightly underestimated. Despite a noticeably reduced spatial variability among the SMOS grid cells, the remotely sensed soil moisture shows a spatial pattern of the soil moisture fields on the area scale, in agreement with the site-specific characteristics of REMEDHUS. No differences were found between the use of ascending and descending orbits. In addition, no differences were detected between the use of time-overpass values of in situ soil moisture and that of the daily average.	requirement;spatial variability;spatiotemporal pattern	Nilda Sanchez-Martin;José Martínez-Fernández;Anna Scaini;Carlos Perez-Gutierrez	2012	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2012.2186971	moisture;database index;spatial variability;common spatial pattern;water content;temperature measurement;hydrology;soil science;physics;satellite;quantum mechanics;grid computing;measurement;remote sensing	Visualization	83.84611355557918	-59.31391756175218	80087

More importantly, such analysis can provide much information for decision-making. Landuse changed rapidly in Guangzhou in the last several years, so that it is necessary to study the spatial structure of landuse change. DOM (Digital Orthophoto Map) of Guangzhou in 2003, 2005 are acquired for this study. Accurate landuse information was first extracted by Definiens Developer. Secondly, we applied the landuse transfer model to analyze the mutual conversions among different landuse classes. Thirdly, a landuse spatial position conversion and quantity change model was established to analyze anduse emote sensing eographical information system igital orthophoto map ynamic change the position conversion of landuse classes from a quantitative perspective. Finally, Landuse dynamicity model is applied to study Guangzhou’s landuse change level and the reasons of the change are analyzed. The results showed that farmland diminished relatively fast and adjustable landuse areas increased substantially. The main reason for farmland reduction lies in that part of the original farmland has been turned into other cultivated lands.

We use dual-frequency airborne radar data to simulate observations at GPM DPR resolution and frequencies and to investigate errors due to nonuniform beam filling effects. Errors at Ku-band are similar to those found in previous studies. Errors in the Ka-band path-integrated attenuation and near-surface reflectivity are larger than at Ku-band. Errors in rain-top reflectivity, where attenuation is neglected, are smaller at Ka-band than at Ku-band because the Ka-band Z-R relation is closer to being linear.	airborne ranger;graphical path method;ka band;ku band;radar;simulation	Stephen L.

The one-year comparisons show that both PW are quite consistent for PW below 20 mm, and the PW derived from COSMIC has systemic low bias than ground-GPS PW for PW >40 mm. In general, the rms of PW difference between COSMIC and IGS is about 1.5-3.0mm, and the mean difference is less than 0.5mm, which is acceptable. In addition, the variations of PW difference in the southern hemisphere are obviously fluctuant due to fewer IGS stations over this region, while the mean PW difference is more stable and smaller around 0.5 mm for latitude higher than 25°N and the standard deviation of PW difference is gradually decreases with higher latitude in the northern hemisphere.	automatic sounding;cosmic;global positioning system;water model	Wenying He	2018	IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8517492	southern hemisphere;remote sensing;occultation;geodesy;latitude;northern hemisphere;standard deviation;global positioning system;mean difference;computer science;precipitable water	Mobile	84.03215472634598	-59.67007062265491	83024

This was achieved by calibrating coefficients of the regression model using SMOS soil moisture and horizontal and vertical brightness temperatures (TB), over the 2013 - 2014 period. Next, this model was applied to recent SMAP TB data from 31/03/2015-08/09/2015. The retrieved surface soil moisture from SMAP (referred here to as SMAP-reg) was compared to the operational SMAP L3 surface soil moisture retrieved using the single channel algorithm. Both exhibit comparable temporal dynamics with a good agreement of correlation (correlation coefficient R mostly > 0.8) between the SMAP-reg and the operational SMAP L3 surface soil moisture products.	algorithm;coefficient;esa;hardware random number generator;terabyte	Amen Al-Yaari;Jean-Pierre Wigneron;Yann Kerr;Nemesio Rodriguez-Fernandez;Peggy O'Neill;Thomas J.

Spectral distance among sites has proven to be a powerful approach for detecting species composition variability. Regression analysis of species similarity versus spectral distance allows us to quantitatively estimate the amount of turnover in species composition with respect to spectral and ecological variability. In classical regression analysis, the residual sum of squares is minimized for the mean of the dependent variable distribution. However, many ecological data sets are characterized by a high number of zeroes that add noise to the regression model. Quantile regressions can be used to evaluate trend in the upper quantiles rather than a mean trend across the whole distribution of the dependent variable. In this letter, we used ordinary least squares (OLS) and quantile regressions to estimate the decay of species similarity versus spectral distance. The achieved decay rates were statistically nonzero (p < 0.01) considering both OLS and quantile regressions. Nonetheless, the OLS regression estimate of the mean decay rate was only half the decay rate indicated by the upper quantiles. Moreover, the intercept value, representing the similarity reached when the spectral distance approaches zero, was very low compared with the intercepts of the upper quantiles, which detected high species similarity when habitats are more similar. In this letter, we demonstrated the power of using quantile regressions applied to spectral distance decay to reveal species diversity patterns otherwise lost or underestimated by OLS regression.	habitat;image noise;ordinary least squares;residual sum of squares;sensor;software regression;spatial variability;visual intercept	Duccio Rocchini;Brian S.

Using the ephemeris of the satellite, a polynomial regression algorithm can fit the satellite orbit at the third or higher order with a main shortcoming that the mutual constraints among the three dimensions defining the orbit are missed. In this paper, a new approach is presented to fit the satellite orbit based on the assumption that the satellite orbit is a 3-D ellipse, which retains the relations among the three dimensions. Considering the complexity of 3-D ellipse parameters estimation, the 3-D orbit is first transformed into three 2-D ellipses. Then, the parameters of these 2-D ellipses are estimated with a direct least-square ellipse fitting method (DLS-EFM). These two orbit fitting algorithms are tested with ten sets of advanced land observation satellite phased array L-band SAR data, which were acquired in north Toronto, Ontario, Canada, from September, 2008 to January, 2009. Moreover, two of them acquired with an adjacent period were chosen to form a repeat-pass InSAR, and the corresponding baseline is calculated with the proposed method as an example. The experimental results show that the error of the satellite position using DLS-EFM is at a submetric level, which is less than one-tenth of that of the polynomial regression algorithm. Consequently, the proposed method is appropriate for the baseline estimation in spaceborne InSAR applications.	algorithm;baseline (configuration management);curve fitting;dls format;estimation theory;gene expression programming;l band;phased array;polarimetry;polynomial;synthetic data;tree (data structure)	Boli Xiong;Jing M.

152f93627ebd1548894a69adc02b72b2130b2a46	the implication of input data aggregation on up-scaling soil organic carbon changes		In up-scaling studies, model input data aggregation is a common method to cope with deficient data availability and limit the computational effort. We analyzed model errors due to soil data aggregation for modeled SOC trends. For a region in North West Germany, gridded soil data of spatial resolutions between 1km and 100km has been derived by majority selection. This data was used to simulate changes in SOC for a period of 30 years by 7 biogeochemical models. Soil data aggregation strongly affected modeled SOC trends. Prediction errors of simulated SOC changes decreased with increasing spatial resolution of model output. Output data aggregation only marginally reduced differences of model outputs between models indicating that errors caused by deficient model structure are likely to persist even if requirements on the spatial resolution of model outputs are low.

As a consequence, we need to understand to what extent and via which pathways climate extremes affect the state and functionality of terrestrial ecosystems and the associated biogeochemical cycles on a global scale. So far the impacts of climate extremes on the terrestrial biosphere were mainly investigated on the basis of case studies, while global assessments are widely lacking. In order to facilitate global analysis of this kind, we present a methodological framework that firstly de- tects spatiotemporally contiguous extremes in Earth observations, and secondly infers the likely pathway of the preceding climate anomaly. The approach does not require long time series, is computationally fast, and easily applicabletoavarietyofdatasetswithdifferentspatialandtemporalresolutions.Thekeyelementofouranalysis strategy is to directly search in the relevant observations for spatiotemporally connected components exceeding a certain percentile threshold. We also put an emphasis on characterization of extreme event distribution, and scrutinize the attribution issue. We exemplify the analysis strategy by exploring the fraction of absorbed photo- synthetically active radiation (fAPAR) from 1982 to 2011. Our results suggest that the hot spots of extremes in fAPAR lie in Northeastern Brazil, Southeastern Australia, Kenya and Tanzania. Moreover, we demonstrate that the size distribution of extremes follow a distinct power law. The attribution framework reveals that extremes in fAPAR are primarily driven by phases of water scarcity.	biosphere;bivariate data;ecosystem;rare events;sensor;terrestrial television;word lists by frequency	Jakob Zscheischler;Miguel D.

These well characterized instruments (CIMEL Sun photometer) make aerosol optical depth measurements based on the transmission of the direct sunlight through the atmosphere in 5 and 8 spectral bands. AERONET aerosol retrievals are limited to clear sky conditions (no clouds or no cirrus clouds) and retrieve aerosol optical depth. To retrieve other parameters such as aerosol size distribution, single scattering albedo, refractive index, etc., retrievals based on algorithms from Nakajima [2] and Dubovik [1] are used. Since the algorithms are limited to clear sky conditions and not available to the public, we decided to write our own retrieval algorithm which uses the solar principal plane and almucantar scans from the CIMEL instrument. We studied a variety of radiative transfer methods that are able to simulate ground measurements by computing the hemispherical sky radiance. For various reasons we decided to use the Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (SBDART) code [4,5] and combined it with IDL's Amoeba (down-hill simplex method) [3] to retrieve five parameters: (1) water cloud optical depth, (2) ice cloud optical depth, (3) cloud water droplet radius, (4) horizontal visibility (related to aerosol optical depth), and (5) RH factor which couples relative humidity and aerosol size distribution, from principal plane and almucantar scans. The SBDART computed sky radiances are very close to the measured sky radiances 40 degrees away from the solar aureole since the Discrete Ordinates Radiative Transfer (DISORT) algorithm [6] is not accurate in the forward scattering direction. In this paper we will show results of the inversion of AERONET data using SBDART.	amoeba;simplex algorithm;simulation	Christoph Borel-Donohue	2006	2006 IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/IGARSS.2006.154	meteorology;radiative transfer;optical depth;atmospheric sciences;relative humidity;sunlight;refractive index;optics;simplex algorithm;physics;quantum mechanics;remote sensing	Theory	82.95081975888422	-64.89140060695554	83790

Effects of two methods for delivering mixtures of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers to oiled beaches were compared to a control. Several forms of hydrocarbon variables were selected as indicators of fertilizer effects in reducing residual oil amounts over that which would disappear by natural causes. The resulting data set was analyzed by multivariate statistical procedures to illustrate a protocol for selection of an optimum set of variables to assess reduction of residual oil through nutrient enrichment applications and to determine statistically significant differences among the treatment application methods. One subset of variables, nC18, phytane, and the sum of amounts of hydrocarbons nC18-nC27, was effective for prediction of amount of residual oil while another subset of variables, phytane, nC22, ratio of nC18/phytane, and residual dry oil, was successful for distinguishing differences in treatments by multivariate analysis of variance and its' associated canonical analysis. The ranked order of differences from small to large in variable responses to fertilization application methods were control, liquid-solid application, and sprinkler application of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers.

caecbb1d384edfe1239756544783b00998513216	satellite-based estimation of hourly pm2.5 concentrations using a vertical-humidity correction method from himawari-aod in hebei	hebei;pm2.5;satellite remote sensing;vertical and rh correction	"""Abstract: Particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) is related to various adverse health effects. Ground measurements can yield highly accurate PM2.5 concentrations but have certain limitations in the discussion of spatial-temporal variations in PM2.5. Satellite remote sensing can obtain continuous and long-term coverage data, and many previous studies have demonstrated the relationship between PM2.5 and AOD (aerosol optical depth) from theoretical analysis and observation. In this study, a new aerosol product with a high spatial-temporal resolution retrieved from the AHI (the Advance Himawari Imager) was obtained using a vertical-humidity correction method to estimate hourly PM2.5 concentrations in Hebei. The hygroscopic growth factor (fRH) was fitted at each site (in a total of 137 matched sites). Meanwhile, assuming that there was little change in fRH at a certain scale, the nearest fRH of each pixel was determined to calculate PM2.5 concentrations. Compared to the correlation between AOD and PM2.5, the relationship between the """"dry"""" mass extinction efficiency obtained by vertical-humidity correction and the ground-measured PM2.5 significantly improved, with r coefficient values increasing from 0.19⁻0.47 to 0.61⁻0.76. The satellite-estimated hourly PM2.5 concentrations were consistent with the ground-measured PM2.5, with a high r (0.8 ± 0.07) and a low RMSE (root mean square error, 30.4 ± 5.5 μg/m³) values, and the accuracy in the afternoon (13:00⁻16:00) was higher than that in the morning (09:00⁻12:00). Meanwhile, in a comparison of the daily average PM2.5 concentrations of 11 sites from different cities, the r values were approximately 0.91 ± 0.03, and the RMSEs were between 13.94 and 31.44 μg/m³. Lastly, pollution processes were analyzed, and the analysis indicated that the high spatial-temporal resolution of the PM2.5 data could continuously and intuitively reflect the characteristics of regional pollutants (such as diffusion and accumulation), which is of great significance for the assessment of regional air quality."""	ahi (amiga);aod consumption;aerosol dose form;coefficient;coverage data;diameter (qualifier value);exposure to humidity;extinction, psychological;growth factor;imager device component;m3 mental health checklist;mean squared error;natural science disciplines;particulate (substance);particulate matter;pixel;seizures;sensor;tooth root structure;tree accumulation;pollutant	Qiaolin Zeng;Liangfu Chen;Hao Zhu;Zifeng Wang;Xinhui Wang;Liang Zhang;Tianyu Gu;Guiyan Zhu;Yang Zhang	2018		10.3390/s18103456	humidity;analytical chemistry;atmospheric sciences;engineering;satellite	HCI	84.19961190856985	-58.51280109467499	83877

The modelled daily ET agrees well with measurements and the R2 is over 0.80.

In this study, the hyperspectral reflectance of winter wheat was selected to optimize the selection of spectral features and to evaluate their performance in modeling LAI at various growth stages during 2008 and 2009. We extracted hyperspectral features using different techniques, including reflectance spectra and first derivative spectra, absorption and reflectance position and vegetation indices. In order to find the best subset of features with the best predictive accuracy, partial least squares regression (PLSR) and variable importance in projection (VIP) were applied to estimated LAI values. The results indicated that the red edge–NIR spectral region (680 nm–1300 nm) was the most sensitive to LAI. Most features in this region exhibited a high correlation with LAI and had higher VIP values, especially the first derivative waveband at 750 nm (r = 0.900, VIP = 1.144). Adding a large number of features would not OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2014, 6 6222 significantly improve the accuracy of the PLSR model. The PLSR model based on the fourteen features with the highest VIP values predicted LAI with a mean bootstrapped R value of 0.880 and a mean RMSE of 0.943 on the validation dataset and produced an estimated LAI result better than that, including the entire 54-feature dataset with a mean R of 0.875 and a mean RMSE of 0.965. The results of this study thus suggest that the use of only a few of the best features by VIP values is sufficient for LAI estimation.	artificial neural network;feature data;feature model;frequency band;motorola canopy;nonlinear system;partial least squares regression;principal component analysis;principal component regression;spatial variability;statistical model;stepwise regression;support vector machine	Xinchuan Li;Youjing Zhang;Yansong Bao;Juhua Luo;Xiuliang Jin;Xingang Xu;Xiaoyu Song;Guijun Yang	2014	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs6076221	econometrics;partial least squares regression;statistics;remote sensing	AI	85.18744398170772	-59.877285940768395	83984

f006837152e68eaf69be88db8b5ed37c21d2bfa0	interannual variations of sea surface temperature in the black sea		This study uses high-resolution blended anomaly data from The United States (US) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in order to analyze Sea Surface Temperature (SST) variability in the Black Sea over the 1981–2015 period. The linear regression indicates that there has been a slight increase in SST with a rate of $0.04\pm 0.005$ °C/yr during this all period. However, the results show that there was a surface cooling in the 1980s followed by the strong warming after this period. Since 1990s, especially for summer sea water temperatures have been consistently higher than those of previous years. On the other hand, the observed sea level rise during 1993–1999 and 2008–2014 is highly correlated with sea surface temperature. Furthermore, monthly averages of the SST anomalies reveal that the maximum SST in the Black Sea occurs in August, while its minimum occurs in January-March. The amplitudes of the annual and the semi-annual cycles of SST anomalies are about 0.8 °C and 0.2 °C, respectively.	anomaly detection;command & conquer:yuri's revenge;computer cooling;heart rate variability;image resolution;semiconductor industry;spatial variability	Nevin Betul Avsar;Shuanggen Jin;Senol Hakan Kutoglu	2018	IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8518183	remote sensing;climatology;sea surface temperature;altimeter;computer science;sea level;sea level rise;seawater	Embedded	83.60599777238116	-57.86860743080245	84697
d9a64823264684281b34a93cf5c7cc9464f3babf	ka-band dual copolarized empirical model for the sea surface radar cross section	wave breaking capillary waves cross section radar backscattering sea surface;radar cross sections sea measurements sea surface backscatter radar antennas;backscatter;sea surface;radar antennas;radar cross sections;sea measurements	This paper presents dual copolarized (PP) (VV and HH) Ka-band sea surface backscattering measurements taken from the Black Sea research platform at incidence angles ranging from 25° to 65° and in the wind speed range from 3 to 18 m/s. These measurements are corrected for radar antenna pattern and geometry of observations. The resulting normalized radar cross section (NRCS) is parameterized in a form of truncated azimuthal Fourier series with coefficients dependent on the incidence angle and wind speed. This dual PP empirical model (KaDPMod) is consistent with the Ku-band NSCAT-4 model. However, some remarkable differences are revealed. They are apparent when analyzed using a decomposition of VV and HH measurements into polarized Bragg backscattering (polarization difference, PD = VV−HH) and nonpolarized (NP) backscattering from breaking waves. The polarization difference (PD) has strong azimuth and wind dependencies, with the wind exponent ranging from 2.5 to 3. The saturation wave spectra derived from multifrequency PD (based on KaDPMod and Ku- and C-band empirical models) have a notable peak in the capillary-gravity range. The relative contribution of NP radar return to the Ka-band NRCS is significant. In the upwind direction, it reaches up to 60%–80% and 25%–50% for HH and VV, respectively. It is found that the NP wind exponent is lower than that for Bragg backscattering. Therefore, the relative contribution of the NP to Ka-band NRCS decreases with increasing wind speed at both polarizations. Such a behavior is the opposite of that observed in the Ku-band.	coefficient;cross section (geometry);distributed bragg reflector;incidence matrix;ka band;ku band;polarization (waves);radar;radiation pattern;verification and validation	Yury Yu.

The forest has a biomass of about 100 t/ha and a woody volume of about 120 m3/ha. A clear increase of polarization index at C-band is observed after intense rain events in two different locations. Simulations of a discrete model attribute this effect to variations of soil moisture and predict an effect comparable with the measured one. Results indicate that there is a potential to monitor soil moisture variations below dry forests with moderate biomass, also in view of the forthcoming availability of L-band data.	antivirus software;computer simulation;digital signature;l band;microwave;polarization (waves);the forest	Francisco Grings;Vanesa Douna;Verónica Barraza;Mercedes Salvia;Haydee Karszenbaum;Néstor Ignacio Gasparri;Paolo Ferrazzoli;Rachid Rahmoune	2012	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2011.2162484	systems modeling;radiometry;water content;forest;biomass;hydrology;soil science;physics;remote sensing	Visualization	83.83722487111717	-59.112418237285695	85083

The grassland in Inner Mongolia is degraded for the low rainfall and overgrazing. Remote sensing techniques allow scientists to examine the AGB over large areas of interest. Studies are focused on the indices such as spectral vegetation index obtained from satellite data, and predicting biomass from them. But recent works show that biomass calculating with sub-pixel parameters such as proportion of components seems more accurate. We here model the AGB with surface parameters that can be inversed from remote sensing data. After analysis of the parameters of the earth's surface, we find that AGB of the grassland is strongly correlative with leaf area index (LAI) in logarithmic coordinate, with the resolutions are both 1m 2 and 1km 2. According to the CAR (Constant Allometric Ratio), AGB and LAI grow harmoniously, with the allometric ratios 0.73461 of the no degraded grassland, 0.93206 of the secondly degraded, 0.94438 of the badly degraded, 1.1579 of grassland in May, 0.83965 of that in July and 0.68059 of that in September. We introduce the coverage to express degradation, the month to express the growth period, then get the remote sensing linked model of AGB. The coefficients in the model are decided by the surface data with resolution 1m 2. After simulating the AGB of differently degraded grassland, we find the maximal, minimal and mean error are respectively 22.90%, 4.05% and 10.68% for CAR model and 11.12%, 3.78% and 8.15% for our model. After accessing the AGB, we find the maximal, minimal and mean error are respectively 26.22%, 0.79% and 11.78% for CAR model and 16.90%, 0.35% and 9.62% for our model. Comparing with spectral vegetation index, our model doesn't change with the scale, the growth period and the degradation. Also with our model, we examine the variety of the allometric ratio of different degraded grassland during the whole growing period and give the explanation. In conclusion, The model can be put into large-scale AGB inspection for the allometry between AGB and LAI doesn't change with the resolution, and the parameters are easily got from remote sensing data. © 2005 IEEE.

From the viewpoint of long term forecasting, however, models developed for this area suffer from limitations introduced by parametric uncertainty, absence of data for appropriate specification of forcing and lateral boundary conditions. For improving the model forecasts, a data assimilation technique based on ensemble Kalman filter is implemented and applied. Based on the latter, an ensemble based steady state Kalman filter is derived to address the computational limitation for daily operational forecasting. Via a twin experiment on a simulation period that includes a significant storm surge event (sea level anomaly) the skills of both data assimilation schemes are assessed and compared.

In this paper a physical single channel algorithm was developed for retrieving LST from the Landsat 8 TIRS data. ASTER Global Emissivity Dataset (GED) and Vegetation Cover Method (VCM) were chosen to improve the accuracy of land surface emissivity and the fast radiative transfer model RTTOV was utilized for atmospheric correction which uses MERRA reanalysis data as inputs. The algorithm is evaluated by the ground measurements collected from in situ sites during the HiWATER experiment. The LST result shows a dynamical variation with the phenological changes and the average Bias and RMSE of the estimated LST for all sites after remove outliers are 0.09K and 2.20K, respectively. This indicates that the algorithm is suitable for producing LST product from Landsat 8 TIRS data and ASTER GED can be used to improve the accuracy of land surface emissivity in arid and semi-arid area.	advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer;algorithm;meteorological reanalysis;semiconductor industry;video for windows	Xiangchen Meng;Hua Li;Yongming Du;Qinhuo Liu;Jinshan Zhu;Lin Sun	2016	2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730121	meteorology;sea surface temperature;hydrology;earth;physics;satellite;remote sensing	Robotics	84.50238356700014	-61.26312112751365	85841

The split-window (SW)-type retrieval algorithm was developed through radiative transfer model simulations under various atmospheric profiles, satellite zenith angles, surface emissivity values and surface lapse rate conditions using Moderate Resolution Atmospheric Transmission version 4 (MODTRAN4). The estimation capabilities of the COMS SW (CSW) LST algorithm were evaluated for various impacting factors, and the retrieval accuracy of COMS LST data was evaluated with collocated Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST data. The surface emissivity values for two SW channels were generated using a vegetation cover method. The CSW algorithm estimated the LST distribution reasonably well (averaged bias = 0.00 K, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 1.41 K, correlation coefficient = 0.99); however, the estimation capabilities of the CSW algorithm were significantly impacted by large brightness temperature differences and surface lapse rates. The CSW algorithm reproduced spatiotemporal variations of LST comparing well to MODIS LST data, irrespective of what month or time of day the data were collected from. The one-year evaluation results with MODIS LST data showed that the annual mean bias, RMSE and correlation coefficient for the CSW algorithm were −1.009 K, 2.613 K and 0.988, respectively.	algorithm;catalog service for the web;coefficient;geosynchronous satellite;shattered world;simulation;software quality assurance	A.-Ra Cho;Myoung-Seok Suh	2013	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs5083951	meteorology;hydrology;evaluation;remote sensing	ML	83.97600623484225	-61.62448502723175	85936

This yielded a two-dimensional intrinsic mode function (IMF3) image that meticulously depicts the spatial distribution relationship between various gold deposits and the different geological units of the gold field. By combining the IMF3 image with geological features, the Tongshi gold field can be divided into three geological units. Unit I is made up of both Archean greenstone and Cambrian–Ordovician carbonate rocks and is defined as a concealed basement that exhibits weak negative and positive gravity anomalies. Unit II is defined as a Mesozoic volcanic sediment basin consisting of Jurassic and Cretaceous volcanic-sedimentary rocks, which developed on the concealed basement and exhibits an obvious negative gravity anomaly. Unit III, located on the concealed basement on the SW side of the Mesozoic volcanic-sedimentary basin, can be subdivided into subunits IIIa and IIIb. The former, with a negative circular gravity anomaly, indicates that the Tongshi complex consists of both Yanshan diorite-porphyrite and syenite-porphyry. Unit IIIb, with a positive ring gravity anomaly distributed around a negative circular gravity anomaly, indicates a possible contact metasomatic mineralization zone around the Tongshi complex. Almost all types of gold deposits are located within this contact metasomatic mineralization zone and thus the zone is a prospective area for gold deposits. & 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

06b7444a5c92ca2f65f321350fe52963e1c61136	multiple regression analysis for unmixing of surface temperature data in an urban environment		Global climate change and increasing urbanization worldwide intensify the need for a better understanding of human heat stress dynamics in urban systems. During heat waves, which are expected to increase in number and intensity, the development of urban cool islands could be a lifesaver for many elderly and vulnerable people. The use of remote sensing data offers the unique possibility to study these dynamics with spatially distributed large datasets during all seasons of the year and including day and night-time analysis. For the city of Basel 32 high-quality Landsat 8 (L8) scenes are available since 2013, enabling comprehensive statistical analysis. Therefore, land surface temperature (LST) is calculated using L8 thermal infrared (TIR) imagery (stray light corrected) applying improved emissivity and atmospheric corrections. The data are combined with a land use/land cover (LULC) map and evaluated using administrative residential units. The observed dependence of LST on LULC is analyzed using a thermal unmixing approach based on a multiple linear regression (MLR) model, which allows for quantifying the gradual influence of different LULC types on the LST precisely. Seasonal variations due to different solar irradiance and vegetation cover indicate a higher dependence of LST on the LULC during the warmer summer months and an increasing influence of the topography and albedo during the colder seasons. Furthermore, the MLR analysis allows creating predicted LST images, which can be used to fill data gaps like in SLC-off Landsat 7 ETM+ data.	advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer;archive;big data;coefficient;data modeling;day and night (cellular automaton);geographic information system;hotspot (wi-fi);kerrison predictor;learning to rank;map;multi-level cell;relevance;thermal grease;topography	Andreas Wicki;Eberhard Parlow	2017	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs9070684	global warming;geology;land use;regression analysis;remote sensing;vegetation;solar irradiance;linear regression;albedo;land cover	HCI	84.45870554133903	-58.4495503192868	86294

In this paper, a RUE model is established by parameterized plant photosynthesis and respiration. Photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by all surface materials (APARSFC), obtained by correcting photosynthetically active radiation observed by MODIS for the effects of surface albedo, atmospheric total transmittance, and periodical change of solar incident angle and solar hour angle during daytime, together with the ratio of PAR absorbed by the canopy to APARSFC (RPAR) and radiation use efficiency (RUE) based on a relationship between RUE and maximum rate of leaf photosynthesis (Amax) governed by its dependence on seasonal dynamics of foliage nitrogen content, are used to estimate gross photosynthesis. Plant respiration is divided into growing respiration as constant fraction of GPP, and maintenance respiration from leaf, stem, and root. The model is adapted to calculate the net primary productivity (NPP) of temperate deciduous forest in northeast China, supported by auxiliary data composed of daily MODIS data, atmosphere profile, ice-snow cover and landform of the study area in June 2003. In June 2003, daily mean APARSFC of temperate deciduous forest in the study area reaches 8.1 MJ m-2day-1, RUE varies from 0.45 to 1.09 gC MJ-1, and monthly NPP is 0.53 MgC ha-1, 0.56 MgC ha-1 for temperate deciduous coniferous forest, 0.51 MgC ha-1 for temperate deciduous broadleaved forest.

b23b6dfa0a28aa2c59522c90fd25147435f10084	assessment of spinach seedling health status and chlorophyll content by multivariate data analysis and multiple linear regression of leaf image features		Abstract Plant health and physiological status significantly influence chlorophyll content and photosynthetic capacity. Analysis of leaf reflectance information from digitized leaf images allows high-throughput, non-invasive and real-time estimation of chlorophyll content in a cost-effective manner. In the present study the application of multivariate data analysis tools, viz. principal component analysis (PCA) and agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis (AHCA), has been discussed for distinguishing between spinach seedlings having high and low chlorophyll contents by simultaneously using the information provided by various image features. Further, leaf color information contained within different color spaces, viz. RGB (red, green and blue), rgb (normalized red, green and blue), HSI (hue, saturation and intensity), CIE (Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage) L ∗ a ∗ b ∗ , CIE-XYZ, and CIE-xyY color spaces, has been used to predict chlorophyll content in terms of SPAD (Soil Plant Analysis Development) chlorophyll meter values by multiple linear regression. It was observed that the color indices R, G, R + G, R−B, G−B, R + G−B, Y (luminance) and DGCI (dark-green color index) exhibited high correlation ( R 2  u003e 0.8) with the SPAD values. Further, subjecting the leaf reflectance information provided by these color indices to PCA and AHCA enabled a clear segregation of seedlings with high and low chlorophyll contents. SPAD values predicted by the L ∗ a ∗ b ∗ color space information yielded the lowest RMSE (root mean square error) and the highest R 2 (coefficient of determination) amongst the six color space features assessed. The findings of the present study indicate that concatenation of leaf reflectance information provided by different color indices may be more useful than individual color indices for assessing plant health status and predicting chlorophyll content using machine vision.

North China Plain, the most important grain production base of china, is undergoing a process of prominent warming and drying. The vegetation coverage, which is used to monitor vegetation change, can respond to climate change (temperature and precipitation). In this study, GIMMS (Global Inventory Modelling and Mapping Studies)-NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data, MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) – NDVI data and climate data, during 1981–2013, were used to investigate the spatial distribution and changes of vegetation. The relationship between climate and vegetation on different spatial (agriculture, forest and grassland) and temporal (yearly, decadal and monthly) scales were also analyzed in North China Plain. (1) It was found that temperature exhibiting a slight increase trend (0.20 ◦C/10a, P < 0.01). This may be due to the disappearance of 0 ◦C isotherm, the rise of spring temperature. At the same time, precipitation showed a significant reduction trend (−1.75 mm/10a, P > 0.05). The climate mutation period was during 1991–1994. (2) Vegetation coverage slight increase was observed in the 55% of total study area, with a change rate of 0.00039/10a. Human activities may not only accelerate the changes of the vegetation coverage, but also c effect to the rate of these changes. (3) Overall, the correlation between the vegetation coverage and climatic factor is higher in monthly scale than yearly scale. The correlation analysis between vegetation coverage and climate changes showed that annual vegetation coverage was better correlatend with precipitation in grassland biome; but it showed a better correlated with temperature i the agriculture biome and forest biome. In addition, the vegetation coverage had sensitive time-effect respond to precipitation. (4) The vegetation coverage showed the same increasing trend before and after the climatic variations, but the rate of increase slowed down. From the vegetation coverage point of view, the grassland ecological zone had an obvious response to the climatic variations, but the agricultural ecological zones showed a significant response from the vegetation coverage change rate point of view. The effect of human activity in degradation region was higher than that in improvement area. But after the climate abruptly changing, the effect of human activity in improvement area was higher than that in degradation region, and the influence of human activity will continue in the future. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we present a new technique for dielectric measurements of artificially grown sea ice in the frequency range between 0.3 and 12 GHz using an open-ended coaxial probe. To provide a solid contact between the probe and ice, we slightly submerge and then freeze the probe's flange in sea water in a cold laboratory with a preset temperature. Once the ice is formed, we conduct a measurement of the complex reflection coefficient in the cold room using a vector network analyzer. To calibrate the system, we propose a set of measurements from air, shorting block (short), and pure methanol to be conducted immediately after. Both the real and imaginary parts of the complex dielectric constant as functions of frequency are then derived using a coaxial probe inverse model fed by these data. X-ray microtomography analysis of our samples revealed that the ice formed under the described conditions has completely isotropic microstructure typical for the frazil layer of natural first-year sea ice. To evaluate the experimental system's accuracy, we conducted extensive test measurements of standard materials (saline water, methanol, butanol, and pure ice). We also demonstrate that our sea ice dielectric measurements are close to corresponding values previously reported in the literature. The proposed measurement technique is valuable for developing a sea ice dielectric mixture model at microwave frequencies for different temperatures and salinities.	experimental system;frequency band;imaginary time;microwave;mixture model;nonlinear gameplay;packet analyzer;reflection coefficient;salineos;x-ray microtomography	Sergey A.

Analysis of urban warming based on remote sensing method reveals that the urban bias on minimum temperature is rising at a higher rate, 2.5 times (2.85 ground-based observed) more, than on maximum temperature, with a linear trend of 0.15 °C (0.19 °C ground-based observed) and 0.06 °C (0.06 °C ground-based observed) per decade respectively. The results based on remote sensing imagery are compatible with estimates of urban warming based on weather stations. Therefore, the technique presented in this work is a useful tool in estimating the urban heat island contamination in long time series, countering the drawbacks of a ground-observational approach.	numerical analysis;self-replicating machine;simulation;time series	Rafiq Hamdi	2010	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs2122773	meteorology;urbanization;estimation;oceanography;temperature;global warming;urban climatology;climatology;urban heat island;climate change;physics;remote sensing	HCI	84.07269706495589	-58.96713394516722	87876

In situ data are sparse; hence, they are useful to derive snow accumulation from remote sensing observations, such as microwave thermal emission and radar brightness. These data are usually interpreted using electromagnetic models in which volume scattering is the dominant mechanism. The main limitation of this approach is that microwave brightness is not well related to backscatter if the ice sheet is layered. Because larger grain size and thicker annual layers both increase radar image brightness, with the first corresponding to lower accumulation rate and the second to higher accumulation rate, models of radar brightness alone cannot accurately reflect accumulation. Consideration of correlation measurements can also resolve this ambiguity. We introduce an interferometric ice scattering model that relates the interferometric synthetic aperture radar correlation and radar brightness to both ice grain size and hoar layer spacing in the dry-snow zone of Greenland. We use this model and the European Remote Sensing satellite radar observations to derive several parameters related to snow accumulation rates in a small area in the dry-snow zone. These parameters show agreement with four in situ core accumulation rate measurements in this area, whereas models using only radar brightness data do not match the observed variation in accumulation rates	backscatter (email);mass effect trilogy;microwave;radar;sparse matrix;synthetic data;tree accumulation	Shadi Oveisgharan;Howard A.

Recent innovations have allowed oceanographers to collect flow cytometry data continuously during research cruises, leading to an explosion of data and new challenges for the classification task. The massive scale, time-varying underlying populations, and noisy measurements motivate the development of new classification methods. We describe the problem, the data, and some preliminary results demonstrating the difficulty with conventional methods. Flow Cytometry in Science A flow cytometer is an instrument used in the biological sciences to measure cell properties such as size and composition. A flow cytometer measures cells in solution by advancing cells single file through a thin capillary and analyzing its optical properties using laser light. The scattering patterns of the laser can be used to infer cell size, and the wavelengths of light the cell absorbs and re-emits are used to infer the concentration of various pigments that correspond to biological structures of interest. Flow cytometry was developed for use in medical applications, most commonly for immunophenotyping. The usual operating conditions include a cytometer set up in a clean laboratory room with distilled water and carefully curated samples. As cytometry samples became more voluminous, manual classification by direct inspection of scatter plots (“gating”) became a bottleneck and began to be replaced by automated learning algorithms (Aghaeepour et al. 2013). In the environmental sciences, researchers increasingly use flow cytometry to analyze the microbial populations present in samples of air, water, or soil. Biological and climate scientists are particularly interested in the dynamics of phytoplankton, which produce about half of the oxygen on earth and are foundational to the oceanic food web. Challenge: Continuous Measurement of Time-Varying Populations The SeaFlow instrument, a new environmental flow cytometer developed at the University of Washington (Swalwell, Copyright c © 2015, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. Ribalet, and Armbrust 2011), is designed to be deployed on an oceanographic research vessel and operated continuously during multi-week cruises as the vessel moves through different environmental conditions and therefore different microbial populations. Ocean water flows continuously through the instrument, generating a time series of the population breakdown of small phytoplankton. Obtaining this data depends on the ability to classify the particles based on their optical properties. Each particle is measured by its forward scatter at different orientations (which indicate particle size), fluourescence associated with the protein phycoerythrin (orange light), and two different wavelengths of fluorescence associated with chlorophyll (green light). Certain species of microbes exhibit different properties in different environmental conditions; they may tend to grow or shrink, or produce more or less fluourescent proteins. As a result, the location and shape of the clusters in this 6-dimensional space will vary over time as the vessel moves through different water masses. The instrument records data in three-minute windows consisting of millions of particles each. After several weeks, there are thousands of windows to be classified. In practice, scientists apply quality control filters to eliminate noisy observations; however, even after heavy filtering this can still lead to hundreds of GB of data to classify. Moreover, we are currently working with a single instrument, but the project includes plans to deploy instruments on a significant number of vessels simultaneously, exacerbating the scale problem; as a result, automated learning methods are required for classification. There are two obvious naı̈ve choices for formulating a learning problem: clustering the entire dataset as one unit, or clustering each window as a separate dataset. In the first case, the problem is that the vessel passes through different water masses with very different properties; the prior populations being sampled are known to be different, so a “global” clustering approach will perform poorly and not be particularly meaningful. At the other extreme, restricting the clustering to short windows ignores opportunities to model populations that persist across multiple windows. The uncertainty associated with these measurements is also very high relative to traditional flow cytometry applications, given the vessel’s movement, the systematics and calibration issues of the instrument itself, and the diversity Proceedings of the Twenty-Seventh Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence	algorithm;applications of artificial intelligence;cluster analysis;machine learning;microsoft windows;population model;scattering theory;time series;word lists by frequency	Jeremy Hyrkas;Daniel Halperin;Bill Howe	2015			biological classification;computer science;bioinformatics;data science;machine learning;data mining;cluster analysis	AI	89.16117198178097	-58.48449568608415	88923

By fusing data, we can utilize the strengths of the individual sensors that may not be otherwise possible. In this paper, we provide the framework for combining level 2 data products, using data from three sensors aboard the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s Terra satellite. These data include top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) radiative energy fluxes obtained from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES), aerosol optical thickness from the multispectral Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and aerosol properties from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR). The CERES Single Scanner Footprint (SSF) contains the pixel level CERES TOA fluxes and the level 2 MODIS aerosol data. We specifically focus upon fusing the CERES SSF with the MISR aerosol products. Although this project was undertaken specifically to address aerosol research, the methods employed for fusing data products can be used for other problems requiring synergistic data sets. We present selected case studies over different aerosol regimes and indicate that multisensor information provides value-added information for aerosol research that is not available from a single sensor.	cpu cache;multispectral image;pixel;radiant ai;sensor;shortest seek first;synergy;thickness (graph theory);time of arrival	Pawan Gupta;Falguni Patadia;Sundar A.

In the last decade deficit irrigation strategies allowed growers to deal with water shortages, while monitoring stem water potential (Ψstem) is deemed essential for maximising fruit yield and quality. However, because of the intensive labour involved in measuring Ψstem, alternative methods are desirable. The experiment described was conducted in Murcia (Spain) with adult peach trees (Prunus persica (L.) Batsch cv. Flordastar) submitted to different drip irrigation treatments, measuring Ψstem with a pressure chamber and the soil water content with a neutron probe. Agro-meteorological variables were recorded. Seasonal patterns of stem water potential provide a useful diagnostic tool for irrigation management in peach trees. Rainfall events and the meteorological conditions prevailing in autumn pointed to the resilient nature of the peach cultivar studied. Fitting Ψstem by linear regression analysis as a function of soil and atmosphere yielded a significant correlation, with the soil water content being the main contributor to estimating Ψstem. Linear regression analysis highlighted the importance of considering plant water status as a function of the peach tree cultivar, the atmospheric conditions in which it develops and the soil water conditions resulting from irrigation. A multiple linear regression equation based on soil water content in the soil profile, mean daily air vapour pressure deficit (VPDm) and growing degree hours (GDH) data explained 72% of the variance in Ψstem, and is proposed as an alternative to the field measurement of Ψstem.	peach	Isabel Abrisqueta;Wenceslao Conejero;Mercedes Valdés-Vela;Juan Vera;M.

Feeding of livestock on pastures requires constant monitoring of diet composition to ensure consistent levels of animal production. The widely used but conventional techniques to measure the components of feed are impractical to obtain in-field forage quality status for making real-time decisions. Assessment of forage quality parameters using proximal sensing is of particular interest. The present study aimed to demonstrate the potential of using a combination of ultrasonic and canopy reflectance data to predict forage quality variables of heterogeneous pastures. A field experiment with pastures continuously grazed by cows with three stocking density treatments (moderate, lenient and very lenient stocking) was used to calibrate ultrasonic and hyperspectral reflectance sensors. Hyperspectral analysis by a modified partial least square regression (MPLSR) resulted in maximum accuracy for the prediction of acid detergent fibre (ADF) and crude protein (CP) (R2calibration=0.63-0.85). Any reduction of hyperspectral data into vegetation indices based on few specific narrow wavebands or satellite broadbands reduced prediction accuracy significantly. However, prediction of ADF and CP was improved by a combined analysis of ultrasonic sward height and vegetation indices or satellite broadbands, so that most calibration models exceeded an RPD (ratio of standard deviation and standard error of prediction) value of 1.4, which is considered as an acceptable predicting capability for variable field condition. Our findings showed that combined sensing systems using reflectance and ultrasonic sensors may provide acceptable prediction accuracies for practical application even under extremely heterogeneous pasture conditions.

9c65a21288ca728b806d7d8e8748b22903fb13c6	effect of vertical distribution of crop structure and biochemical parameters of winter wheat on canopy reflectance characteristics and spectral indices	vegetation mapping;winter wheat crop properties scenario simulation spectral reflectance vertical distribution;biological system modeling;indexes;current measurement;agriculture indexes soil measurements soil vegetation mapping biological system modeling current measurement;agriculture;soil;soil measurements	Vertical heterogeneity of the canopy is being increasingly recognized in remote estimates of vegetative properties. Given the current limited knowledge of this issue, this paper investigated the effects of different vertical distributions of crop structure [e.g., leaf angle (LA)] and leaf area index (LAI)] and biochemical parameters [e.g., chlorophyll a and b content (Chla+b) and water content (Wc)] on canopy reflectance and vegetation indices (VIs). A recently developed multiple-layer canopy reflectance model (MRTM) was tested for winter wheat and used to run a simulation analysis of different canopy scenarios. The results showed that the MRTM performed well to model winter wheat canopy reflectance with regard to spikes and vertical distributions of leaf properties. The vertical profiles of LA and LAI influenced canopy reflectance at almost all wavelengths, whereas the vertical profile of Chla+b mainly affected reflectance in the visible region, and that of Wc only affected reflectance in the near-infrared region. Changes in vertical distribution of the LA resulted in clear variations in VIs related to the LA, LAI, and Chla+b estimates. The vertical LAI and Chla+b profiles mainly influenced the VIs related to the LAI and Chla+b estimates. The Wc vertical profile primarily affected the VIs used to estimate crop water properties. The sensitivities of the VIs were mainly associated with the spectral responses and penetration characteristics of the bands they used. These findings suggest that the sensitivity of VIs to the vertical distributions of crop parameters should be considered when establishing models for remote crop monitoring.	least-angle regression;motorola canopy;oren–nayar reflectance model;persistent vegetative state;propagation of uncertainty;semantic heterogeneity;simulation	Chunjiang Zhao;Heli Li;Pingheng Li;Guijun Yang;Xiaohe Gu;Yubin Lan	2017	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2016.2604492	agriculture;hydrology;remote sensing	Visualization	84.89814995334501	-57.28922911320841	91179

The surface emissivity is estimated from the model, and the brightness temperatures at the surface are computed as the product of the surface temperature and the computed emissivity.

The principle of this system is twofold. First is to reprocess the altimeter waveforms using the optimal retracker, which is searched base on the analysis from a fuzzy expert system. Second is to minimize the relative offset in the retrieved SLAs when switching from one retracker to another, using a neural network. The system reprocesses 20-Hz waveforms from Jason-2/OSTM in the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. When compare the retrieved SLAs with tide gauge data from Townsville and Bundaberg stations, results show the SLAs from this study generally outperform SLAs from MLE4 and Ice retrackers. It yields higher correlations (≥0.8) and smaller root mean square errors (≤16.6 cm) than those of MLE4 (≤0.78 and ≤19 cm) and Ice (≤0.78 and ≤18.7 cm) retrackers.	artificial neural network;expert system;iterative method;mean squared error;waveform	Nurul Hazrina Idris;Xiaoli Deng	2013	2013 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium - IGARSS	10.1109/IGARSS.2013.6723445	meteorology;geodesy;computer science;iterative method;expert system;artificial neural network;fuzzy control system;remote sensing;sea level	Embedded	85.37906419912332	-63.22478323102304	91258
4ad4c7c87a3b060056b3809b69cf962a1489ce80	refraction angle calculation in multilayered ice for wide-beam airborne radar		We propose an algorithm to calculate the refraction path travelled by a signal from a source to a remote scatterer, through a horizontally parallel multilayer medium with vertical-varying refractive index. The exact solution in a simple two-layered medium requires solving a degree-4 polynomial according to Snell's law, meaning a time-demanding solution. For narrow-beam sources a small-angle approximation is commonly used. In this new technique, we transformed the governing equations until the system can be solved by intersection of two curves. As these are monotonic with opposite slope, the crossing point can be estimated by iteration, with a minimum search algorithm. This method has been applied to focus synthetic aperture radar images of the Antarctic bedrock, improving the detected response in the wide-beam case, and reducing time regarding to compute the polynomial solution.	airborne ranger;approximation;automatic sounding;iteration;multiphase particle-in-cell method;parallel computing;polynomial;radar;search algorithm;synthetic intelligence;whole earth 'lectronic link	Alvaro Arenas-Pingarron;Paul V.

Channel 18.7 and 36.5GHz of FY-3B/MWRI are used to implement retrieval algorithm. Two databases are constructed: one is 15,153 matchups of MWRI TB and NSIDC global swath ocean products for rain rate retrieving and another databset of 5,093 matchups retrieved rain rates and NSIDC rain rate products is used for error estimation of the retrievals. The retrieved rain rates show good agreement with the NSIDC surface rain rates in rain structures. Although there are slightly overestimated at heavy rain rates, the total bias is only 0.8467 mm/h and the total rms is 4.3475 mm/h even in the intensive TCs.

Furthermore, there has been a strong reliance on central tendency based, correlative models in examining the relationships between ecological distributions and processes and climate predictors. The models are then applied to future climate scenarios, yielding predictions of future ecological distributions and processes. While interesting approaches they are also deemed with prediction error and uncertainty. Many of these research lines ignore basic ecological knowledge of non-climate factors known to influence the distribution of plants. Largely, we would presume, because these factors are significantly more difficult to derive at large scales than climate data which is widely available. These approaches also fail to recognize the principle of limiting factors.	ecosystem;process (computing)	Jonathan A. Greenberg;Maria João Santos;Solomon Dobrowski;Susan L.

The application of cellular automata (CA) in urban modeling can give insights into a wide variety of urban phenomena. The SLEUTH model, being as a well-tested CA, was utilized. Calibration data for the model were acquired from different sources of remotely sensed data recorded in 1967, 1977, 1987, 1998 and 2007. In this context three different excluded maps representing different scenarios were utilized during the calibration process in order to analyze the effects of different policies on urban growth. Each calibration scenario yielded its own parameter values. Thirteen calibration metrics for each scenario were derived. Integrating different exclusion layers to the beginning of the calibration process has reduced the number of possible growth patterns. The overall growth characteristics of Adana were similar for all calibration results and defined as organic growth except for the fact that the spatial allocation and the amount of potential urban pixels were different.	population dynamics	Anil Akin;Keith C.

e3799840140ac45c5b06c202f022f097ebe08bbc	gofp: a geometric-optical model for forest plantations		Geometric-optical (GO) model suitable for forest plantation (GOFP) is a GO model for forest plantations at the stand level developed in this study based on a four-scale GO model a Geometric-Optical Model for Sloping Terrains-II (GOST2), which simulates the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) for natural forest canopies. In most previous GO models, tree distributions are often assumed to meet the Poisson or Neyman model in a forest; therefore, these models are suitable for simulating BRDF for natural forest canopies. However, in forest plantations, tree distributions are proven to meet the hypergeometric model rather than the Poisson or Neyman model at the stand level. GOFP, in which the tree distributions are described using the hypergeometric model, is proposed to simulate the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) of forest plantations at the stand level. The area ratios of the four scene components (sunlit foliage, sunlit ground, shaded foliage, and shaded ground) of GOFP compare well with those simulated by a 3-D canopy visualization technique. A comparison is also made against discrete anisotropic radiative transfer, showing that GOFP has the ability to simulate BRF of forest plantations. Another comparison is made against operational land imager and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer surface reflectance, showing that GOFP with the hypergeometric model outperforms GOST2 with the Poisson and Neyman models. The results further show that the differences in BRFs between GOFP and GOST2 pronouncedly increase with the difference between the reflectance of sunlit foliage ( $R_{T}$ ) and the reflectance of sunlit ground ( $R_{G}$ ), as well as the distances among trees and the number of crowns in a forest plantation, suggesting that GOFP significantly outperforms GOST2 for simulating BRF of forest plantations.	anisotropic diffusion;bidirectional reflectance distribution function;binocular disparity;image sensor;motorola canopy;residential gateway;shading;simulation	Jun Geng;Jing M.

A neural network training function was used to estimate the contribution coefficients of physical properties that play a part in determining the Ep. For this process, the resistivity and density values of areas for which borehole data exist were used as training input vectors, and a target probability vector was constructed using the borehole data. The pseudo-Ep was then calculated using the estimated contribution coefficients. The range of pseudo-Ep was adjusted for conversion to the Ep of cavities, and this new approach was verified by comparison with previous researches and commensurate with previous results. The new probability approach is useful not only for detecting cavities, but also for imaging underground structures. & 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Landsat imagery of metropolitan Kansas City, USA was used to generate time series of land cover data over the past three decades. Based on remotely sensed land cover data, landscape metrics were calculated. Both the remotely sensed data and landscape metrics were used to characterize long-term trends and patterns of urban sprawl. Land cover change analyses at the metropolitan, county, and city levels reveal that over the past three decades the significant increase of built-up land in the study area was mainly at the expense of non-forest vegetation cover. The spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the land cover changes allowed the identification of fast and slow sprawling areas. The landscape metrics were analyzed across jurisdictional levels to understand the effects of the built-up expansion on the forestland and non-forest vegetation cover. The results of the analysis suggest that at the metropolitan level both the areas of non-forest vegetation and the forestland became more fragmented due to development while large forest patches were less affected. Metrics statistics show that this landscape effect occurred moderately at the county level, while it could be only weakly identified at the city level, suggesting a scale effect that the landscape response of urbanization can be better revealed within larger spatial units (e.g., a metropolitan area or a county as compared to a city). The interpretation of the built-up patch density metrics helped identify different stages of urbanization in two major urban sprawl directions of the metropolitan area. Land consumption indices (LCI) were devised to relate the remotely sensed built-up growth to changes in housing and commercial constructions as major driving factors, providing an effective measure to compare and characterize urban sprawl across jurisdictional boundaries and time periods. 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Investigating the response of plant communities to climate change is needed to gain insight into the potentially detrimental effects on ecosystem processes. While many studies have used satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) as a proxy for air temperature, few studies have attempted to create and validate models of forest understory temperature (Tust), as it is obscured from these space-borne observations. This study worked to predict instantaneous values of Tust using daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST data over a 99,000 km2 study area located in the Rocky Mountains of western Alberta, Canada. Specifically, we aimed to identify the forest characteristics that improve estimates of Tust over using LST alone. Our top model predicted Tust to within a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.4 ◦C with an overall model fit of R2 = 0.89 over two growing seasons. Canopy closure and the LiDAR-derived standard deviation of canopy height metric were found to significantly improve estimations of Tust over MODIS LST alone. These findings demonstrate that canopy structure and forest stand-type function to differentiate understory air temperatures from ambient canopy temperature as seen by the sensor overhead.	align (company);approximation algorithm;approximation error;ecosystem;ecosystem model;human height;interaction;map;motorola canopy;overhead (computing);pixel;proxy server;spatial scale;the forest;time series	David N.

These measurements are valuable to improved understanding of the Earth's water, energy, and carbon cycles, and to applications of societal benefit. In order for soil moisture and freeze/thaw to be retrieved accurately from SMAP microwave data, a variety of global static and dynamic ancillary data are required. The choice of which ancillary datasets to use for SMAP products will be based on a number of factors including availability and ease of use, their inherent error and resulting impact on SMAP retrieval accuracies, and compatibility with similar choices made by ESA's SMOS mission.	algorithm;carbon cycle;esa;image resolution;microwave;usability	Peggy O'Neill;Erika Podest;Eni G.

2263414a0af827ffd5fd49de8628ca8a3cc04920	direct assimilation of ahi and abi infrared radiances in nwp models		The launches of the US Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) on November 19, 2016 and the Japanese Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) on October 7, 2014 represented a new era of geostationary operational environmental satellite (GOES) imagers. Both ABI and AHI provide many more channels than any other already launched GOES imagers in the world. In this study, we compare the impacts of assimilating all ABI and/or AHI versus GOES-like infrared channels radiances on regional quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs) over US and China, respectively. Positive impacts on QPFs over land are obtained for a typical summer precipitation case by assimilating either all ten AHI infrared channels (AHI-10) or only four GOES-like AHI channels (AHI-4) when compared with a control experiment without assimilating GOES observations (CTRL). It is found that a southwest to northeast oriented band of the atmosphere with high water vapor content that was formed and moved inland with time under the influence of a subtropical high and an eastward propagating middle-latitude trough was responsible for the persistent precipitation in the eastern China of the selected case. The AHI-10 experiment generated larger improvements on QPFs due to it generating a wetter atmosphere in the middle and low troposphere over the ocean off the southeast coast of China than the AHI-4 and CTRL experiments.	advanced risc computing;application binary interface;data assimilation;experiment;numerical weather prediction	Xiaolei Zou;Fuzhong Weng;Zhengkun Qin	2017	2017 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8126952	meteorology;geostationary operational environmental satellite;remote sensing;computer science;trough (meteorology);troposphere;data assimilation;precipitation;water vapor;atmospheric model;subtropical ridge	Embedded	83.00328516429187	-59.30829707251147	94275

We constructed a simulation model for land-use patterns under a drought transition (i.e., the increased frequency and duration of drought since the late 1970s in the Yongding River Basin study area) to account for the complexity of both the driving factors behind land-use change and the micro-level changes in land-use patterns. This model was a combination of the ''top-down'' system dynamics model, the ''bottom-up'' cellular automaton model, and the artificial neural network model. In this model, we considered the socioeconomic development and water resource restrictions, as well as the balance between the land-use requirements and the land supply. We then verified the model through a case study. The results demonstrated the value of constructing a simulation model driven by water resource constraints under the influence of drought. The spatial distribution of land uses in future scenarios will help support decision-making for sustainable regional development.

2798044bcc53111ffde99a90bb84b244804db623	the error transfer of doppler spectrum model in ocean surface current direct inversion		Microwave remote sensing is one of the most useful methods for observing the ocean parameters. The doppler frequency of the radar echoes can be used for ocean surface current speed retrieval. While the effect of the ocean currents and waves are interactional. In this paper the suitable ocean wave elevation spectrum and directional distribution function are selected by comparing the ocean doppler spectrum in C band with the empirical geophysical model function (CDOP). The simulation results show that the ocean surface current speed error is sensitive to the wind speed and wind direction error. With VV polarization, the ocean surface current speed error is about 0.15 m/s when the wind speed error is 2 m/s, and the ocean surface current speed error is smaller than 0.3 m/s when the wind direction error is within 20° in the cross wind direction.

These techniques require surface emissivity composites created from SSM/I and infrared (IR) data. Two different physical methods are tested: a single-channel (SC) approach (either 85.5-GHz channel); and a normalized polarization difference (NPD) approach (37 or 85.5 GHz). Comparisons were made at four sites in Oklahoma and Kansas over an 11-month period. The 85.5-GHz NPD method was the most accurate and robust under most conditions. An error analysis shows that the method's random errors are dominated by uncertainties in the surface emissivity and instrument noise. Since the SC method is more prone to systematic errors (such as surface emissivity errors caused by rain events), it initially compared poorly to the ground observations. After filtering for rain events, the comparisons improved. Overall, the root mean square (rms) errors ranged from 0.12 to 0.14 kg m/sup -2/, suggesting these methods can provide, at best, three categories of cloud LWP. It is anticipated that the techniques and strategies developed in this study, and prior related studies, to analyze passive microwave data will be requisite for maximizing the information content of future instruments.	microwave	Thomas J.

This study provides a quantitative assessment of multiple scattering in the reflectance of semiarid shrublands and explores its relationship to the characteristics of shrubs (density and height) and imaging parameters (wavelength and viewing angles). Field measurements were conducted at the southern fringe of the Otindag Sandy Land in China. A Monte Carlo ray tracing model, the Forest LIGHT interaction model (FLIGHT), was applied to simulate the multiple scattering results. FLIGHT simulation results were first evaluated against field measurements and then compared with a Landsat-8 OLI image. Results show that: 1) the contribution of multiple scattering to the spectra of a scene increases linearly with the fractional cover of vegetation and crown height; 2) in general, multiple scattering has a stronger effect on the near-infrared (NIR) domain than on the visible bands; 3) shadows significantly strengthen the multiple scattering effect, specifically within the visible bands; and 4) 80 to 100% of the total multiple scattering is caused by the second-order scattering within the visible bands and 60% to 90% within the NIR band. This study helps to improve our understanding of the multiple scattering effect and to select between linear and nonlinear spectral unmixing models to solve the abundances of shrubs and soil in mixed pixels.	crown group;experiment;flight simulator;monte carlo method;nonlinear system;pixel;rca spectra 70;ray tracing (graphics);simulation;the forest;wario land: shake it!

The detection system explores both qualitative and quantitative information extracted from spectral data with the aid of an advanced neuro-fuzzy identification model. The proposed model constructs its initial rules by clustering while the final fuzzy rule base is determined by competitive learning.

The method consists of three basic correction procedures, i.e. the radiant correction over sensor, atmospheric radiant correction and topographic radiant correction respectively. This method just needs two dark surfaces at different elevations found in TM Bands blue and red from TM/ETM imagery, and the atmospheric properties can be determined spatially in a way similar in principles to Gilabert’s but differs by introducing the DEM to extend the unique atmospheric properties to the distributed regimes. The topographic radiant correction algorithm thus was developed to ensure the removal of the topographic effects as much as possible using the distributed atmospheric property information obtained as above mentioned. By this way, the TM/ETM+ imaginary can be corrected not only atmospherically but also topographically for TM/ETM bands 1-5 and 7. Finally, a band integration method was used to obtain the total continuous spectral albedo over the experiment site at the Heihe River Basin, and the results show the fairly satisfied performance of the method in real surface reflectance retrieval and the further inversion on surface albedo.

In the last decades, scientific research has suggested a strong link between the health of the Amazon and the integrity of the global climate: tropical forests and woodlands (e.g., savannas) exchange vast amounts of water and energy with the atmosphere and are thought to be important in controlling local and regional climates. Consider the importance of the Amazon biome to the global climate changes impacts and the role of the protected area in the conservation of biodiversity and state-of-art of downscaling model techniques based on ANN Calibrate and run a downscaling model technique based on the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that is applied to the Amazon region in order to obtain regional and local climate predicted data (e.g., precipitation).

In order to provide safe and reliable links to integrate UAS into the National Airspace System (NAS), control and nonpayload communication (CNPC) system requirements are being specified. A comprehensive knowledge of the air-to-ground (AG) channels in the bands of interest (C-band and L-band) plays an essential role. The NASA Glenn Research Center has sponsored an AG channel measurement campaign for most of the typical ground site (GS) local environments, including over water [8], hilly/mountainous [9], suburban, and near-urban. As a continuation of our prior study, this paper addresses the suburban and near-urban scenarios. Our developed AG channel models include path loss, small-scale fading Ricean K factors, spatial and interfrequency correlations for multiple aircraft antennas, root-mean-square (RMS) delay spread, and wideband tapped delay line (TDL) models. The path loss is described by either log-distance or two-ray models, with small corrections for flight direction. The K factors were 12 (14) dB in L-band and 27.4 (28.5) dB in C-band in near-urban (suburban) environments. The interband signals were uncorrelated, but the intra-band signals were highly correlated, with the median correlation coefficient greater than 0.85. The C-band RMS delay spread was on average 10 to 60 ns, with maximum of approximately 4 μs. The TDL models are composed of the line-of-sight (LOS) component, a ground reflection, and up to seven intermittent multipath components (MPCs). Relative power, phase, occurrence probability, duration, and excess delays for these intermittent MPCs are quantified. An algorithm to simulate the AG channel impulse response (CIR) via the TDL models is provided.	algorithm;coefficient;committed information rate;continuation;digital delay line;l band;line-of-sight (missile);multipath propagation;offset binary;requirement;roland gs;simulation;system requirements;unmanned aerial vehicle	David W.

For example, the complex currents in harbors seriously affect the safety of vessels, while river turbulence and vortices cause safety hazards for people participating in white-water rafting, swimming, and other sports activities. In this paper, we demonstrate a low-cost method to measure and model surface currents. Specially designed GPS sensors are dropped into the water to record their drifting trajectories, which are then transformed into a current map to show the characteristics of the currents, including their velocity and direction. A proof-of-concept experiment shows the feasibility of the proposed method and how turbulence locations can be identified. We further demonstrate that the derived current map can be used to construct a mobility model of a drifting object and generate its virtual drifting trajectories. Our analyses show that the generated virtual trajectories closely fit the collected trajectories.	global positioning system;sensor;turbulence;velocity (software development);vortex	Huang-Chen Lee;Chun-Yu Lin;Chun-Han Lin;Sheng-Wen Hsu;Chung-Ta King	2011	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2010.2062730	meteorology;ocean current;physics;remote sensing	Vision	88.34805302646953	-61.13371732934059	95768

After removing the volume scattering contribution in the full polarimetric SAR signature, only the surface scattering component is used to retrieve the soil moisture. The simplified algorithm is evaluated on the dense time series of UAVSAR data and detailed ground truth measurements covering the whole crop growth period. The results show that the performance of the soil moisture retrieval depends on both the crop types and the phonological developing stage. The fields covered by soybean obtain better results than other crop type, due to the low crop height and biomass. This study validate the potential of polarimetric decomposition for soil moisture retrieval over vegetated agricultural fields.	algorithm;ground truth;polarimetry;time series	Hongquan Wang;Ramata Magagi;Kalifa Goita;Thomas Jagdhuber;Najib Djamai	2015	2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7325857	agriculture;synthetic aperture radar;hydrology;soil science;scattering;physics;vegetation;remote sensing	Vision	84.50596309515716	-60.49747365636215	95918

In this paper, we propose a framework to: 1) quantitatively analyze and compare the scale invariance and multifractal properties of θ in the presence of irrigation; and 2) filter out the effect of irrigated croplands in the application of a multifractal downscaling algorithm based on the hypothesis of spatial homogeneity. For this aim, we use the θ data sets of the National Airborne Field Experiments 2005 (NAFE05) and 2006 (NAFE06) campaigns in Australia. Results show that irrigation affects the scale-invariance properties (tested from 32 to 1 km) in a large high-density agricultural district in the semi-arid NAFE06 site, although it does not have a significant impact on the sparser agricultural districts of the temperate NAFE05 region. The multifractal downscaling model was calibrated using a strategy that attenuates the effect of irrigation on θ fields, thus mimicking natural settings. Performances, tested against aircraft and, for the first time, ground-based observations, are adequate in most cases. Some deficiencies are found for drier conditions in regions with a higher percentage of irrigated fields, suggesting the need to further refine the techniques for detecting irrigated croplands. Overall, the findings of this work reveal that the impact of irrigation on the soil moisture statistical variability and downscaling is larger in drier regions or conditions, where irrigation creates a drastic contrast with the surrounding areas.	algorithm;calibration (statistics);downscaling;experiment;heart rate variability;image resolution;image scaling;l band;multifractal system;performance;pixel;randomness;refinement (computing);semiconductor industry;sensor;simulation;spatial variability	Ara Ko;Giuseppe Mascaro;Enrique R.

Physical models of time varying environmental processes can be used to address the time and three dimensional aspect of the environment, but standalone models become inaccurate over time. Data assimilation is the term used to describe the continual input of new data into an executing model to keep the model aligned with reality.

Three kinds of landscape were generated on lattice space: ideal, random and fractal landscape. Each lattice cell had a value ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, interpreted as transition probability, P(trans), which represents spatially distributed property of the landscapes. The heterogeneity of the fractal landscape was characterized by a parameter, H, controlling aggregation of lattice cells with higher value of P(trans). Higher H values corresponded to higher aggregation levels. The model made use of minimized local rules based on empirical data that determines the development of the foraging territory. Additionally, seasonal cycle (summer and winter season), and obstacles which hinder the growth of the territory were incorporated in the model as environmental variables. Territory size was largest in the ideal landscape while it was larger in the random landscape than in the fractal landscape. As obstacle density increased, the territory size decreased. In the fractal landscape, the territory size increased, decreased, and increased again as H increased.	baseline (configuration management);carpodacus formosanus;fractal landscape;isoptera;large;largest;lattice model (physics);markov chain;population parameter;reuse (action);rule (guideline);simulation;underground lakes;united states department of agriculture;universities;wolfenstein: enemy territory;xfig	S.-H.

The transmission and absorption spectra in the range of 0.3-2 THz were measured by using THz time-domain spectroscopy. The mean transmittance and absorption coefficients were applied to analyze the change regulation of WC. In addition, the Savitzky-Golay method was performed to preprocess the spectra. Then, the partial least squares (PLS), kernel PLS (KPLS), and Boosting-PLS were conducted to establish models for predicting WC based on the processed transmission and absorption spectra. Reliable results were obtained by these three methods. KPLS generated the best prediction accuracy of WC. The prediction coefficient correlation (Rval) and root mean square error (RMSEP) of KPLS based on transmission were Rval = 0.8508, RMSEP = 0.1015, and that based on absorption were Rval = 0.8574, RMSEP = 0.1009. Results demonstrated that THz spectroscopy combined with modeling methods provided an efficient and feasible technique for detecting plant physiological information.	brassica rapa;brassica rapa ab.ige:acnc:pt:ser:qn;calibration;coefficient;contain (action);dehydration;epilepsies, partial;intel terahertz;kernel density estimation;leaf subroutine;mean squared error;nonlinear system;papillon-lefevre disease;partial least squares regression;plant leaves;plant roots;preprocessor;projections and predictions;sensor;spectroscopy, near-infrared;test set;write combining;writing commons	Pengcheng Nie;Fangfang Qu;Lei Lin;Tao Dong;Yong He;Yongni Shao;Yi Zhang	2017		10.3390/s17122830	analytical chemistry;absorption spectroscopy;engineering;terahertz spectroscopy and technology;spectroscopy;water content;partial least squares regression;transmittance;mean squared error	Vision	87.47338682242498	-53.57412905643626	96671

The geoid is a surface on which the Earth’s gravity field is uniform. The ocean surface topography is caused by ocean waves, tides, currents, and the loading of atmospheric pressure. The main application of ocean surface topography is for the determination of large-scale ocean circulation.	topography	Lee-Lueng Fu	2014		10.1007/978-0-387-36699-9_167	ocean surface topography	Graphics	83.22012150668185	-64.63238223732242	96823

b67a1a50831ccf14e950d45d3b6a9c88b54b6635	assessing the use of multiple constraints and ancillary data to support scope model inversion in a experimental grassland		The SCOPE model embeds the state of art for coupling soil vegetation atmosphere transfer (SVAT) and radiative transfer models (RTM). For that reason the FLuorescence EXplorer (FLEX) mission selected this model to derive vegetation properties through inversion. However inverse problem is often ill-posed, providing equally likely solutions and hence inflating the uncertainty of the retrieved parameters. In this work we test the use of different priors based on ancillary measurements and literature to support multiple-constrain inversion of SCOPE. Results show that prior information on the relationships between variables such as leaf chlorophyll content $(C_{\text{ab}})$, leaf carotenoids content $(C_{\text{ca}})$, leaf water content $(C_{\mathrm{w}})$ and/or maximum carboxylation rate $(V_{\text{cmax}})$ reduce inversion uncertainties and overfitting, and should be sampled/estimated together with optical data.	overfitting;serialization;well-posed problem	Javier Pacheco-Labrador;Nuno Carvalhais;Óscar Pérez-Priego;Tarek S.

dbbc3ac51aff1994be8ac33c9a9824cdc3066bff	satellite and ground remote sensing techniques to trace the hidden growth of a lava flow field: the 2014-2015 effusive eruption at fogo volcano (cape verde)		Fogo volcano erupted in 2014–2015 producing an extensive lava flow field in the summit caldera that destroyed two villages, Portela and Bangaeira. The eruption started with powerful explosive activity, lava fountains, and a substantial ash column accompanying the opening of an eruptive fissure. Lava flows spreading from the base of the eruptive fissure produced three arterial lava flows. By a week after the start of the eruption, a master lava tube had already developed within the eruptive fissure and along the arterial flow. In this paper, we analyze the emplacement processes based on observations carried out directly on the lava flow field, remote sensing measurements carried out with a thermal camera, SO2 fluxes, and satellite images, to unravel the key factors leading to the development of lava tubes. These were responsible for the rapid expansion of lava for the ~7.9 km length of the flow field, as well as the destruction of the Portela and Bangaeira villages. The key factors leading to the development of tubes were the low topography and the steady magma supply rate along the arterial lava flow. Comparing time-averaged discharge rates (TADR) obtained from satellite and Supply Rate (SR) derived from SO2 flux data, we estimate the amount and timing of the lava flow field endogenous growth, with the aim of developing a tool that could be used for hazard assessment and risk mitigation at this and other volcanoes.	discharger;magma;topography;visualizing energy resources dynamically on the earth;volcano plot (statistics)	Sonia Calvari;Gaetana Ganci;Sónia Silva Victória;Pedro Abel Hernández;Nemesio M.

Qualitative analysis of the multiangular data measured by the RADARSAT synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor shows a good agreement with surface and vegetation volume scattering fundamental behaviors. For a quantitative analysis, allometric equations and measurements of tree components collected within the framework of the Extended Collaboration to Link Ecophysiology and Forest Productivity (ECOLEAP) project are used, in an existing multilayer radiative transfer model for forest canopies, to simulate the RADARSAT SAR data. In our approach, the fractional cover of trees estimated from aerial photographs is used as a weighting parameter to adapt the closed-canopy backscattering model to the sparse forest under study. Our objective is to analyze the sensitivity of the backscattering coefficient as a function of sensor configuration, soil wetness, forest cover, and forest structural properties in order to determine the suitable soil, vegetation, and sensor parameters for a given thematic application. For the entire incidence angle domain (20 to 50 ) of the sensor, simulations show that over a sparse forest composed of mature trees the monitoring of the ground surface is possible only under very wet soil conditions. Therefore, this article informs about the ability of the RADARSAT SAR sensor in monitoring wetlands. In addition, it is shown that the discrepancies between the simulation results and the RADARSAT SAR measurements are mainly related to the natural variability of soil and vegetation characteristics over the sites of study.	aerial photography;aperture (software);coefficient;incidence matrix;institute for operations research and the management sciences;jaccard index;motorola canopy;simulation;sparse matrix;spatial variability;synthetic data	Ramata Magagi;Monique Bernier;Chhun-Huor Ung	2002	IEEE Trans.

In Denmark it is reported that from 1977 to 2000 the date on which the accumulated birch pollen counts reached 2.5 percent of the total catch has changed from 12th of May to 25th of April. The total cumulated amount of birch pollen has also increased 2-3 times. The Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling System (GIMMS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) dataset from 1982 to 1999 was used to investigate whether low resolution satellite data can be used for measuring the budburst of birch, that coincide well with the start of the birch pollen season. This study indicates that NDVI values computed from low resolution low data-cost satellites can be used to monitor the start date of birch pollen In the spring, even in areas where the birch is not the dominating tree species. This can be used to improve forecast models for pollen and look for evidence of climatic change. It was found that during the 18 years period studied, the start date of the birch pollen season is stable or delayed in northern Fennoscandia and high latitude areas. In southern Fennoscandia and oceanic parts of western Norway the onset of the birch pollen season is considerable earlier.	birch bark manuscript;pollen	Kjell Arild Høgda;Stein Rune Karlsen;Inger Solheim;Hans Tømmervik;Hallvard Ramfjord	2002		10.1109/IGARSS.2002.1027162	meteorology;image resolution;normalized difference vegetation index;climatology;climate change;seasonality;statistics;cumulant	DB	83.74754410885726	-57.0280110780202	98591

A two-year field experiment was conducted in a commercial pear orchard with five N application rates: 0 (N0), 165 (N1), 330 (N2), 660 (N3), and 990 (N4) kg·N·ha-1. The mid-portion leaves on the year's shoot were selected for the spectral measurement first and then N concentration determination in the laboratory at 50 and 80 days after full bloom (DAB). Three methods of in-field spectral measurement (25° bare fibre under solar conditions, black background attached to plant probe, and white background attached to plant probe) were compared. We also investigated the modelling performances of four chemometric techniques (principal components regression, PCR; partial least squares regression, PLSR; stepwise multiple linear regression, SMLR; and back propagation neural network, BPNN) and three vegetation indices (difference spectral index, normalized difference spectral index, and ratio spectral index). Due to the low correlation of reflectance obtained by the 25° field of view method, all of the modelling was performed on two spectral datasets-both acquired by a plant probe. Results showed that the best modelling and prediction accuracy were found in the model established by PLSR and spectra measured with a black background. The randomly-separated subsets of calibration (n = 1000) and validation (n = 420) of this model resulted in high R² values of 0.86 and 0.85, respectively, as well as a low mean relative error (<6%). Furthermore, a higher coefficient of determination between the leaf N concentration and fruit yield was found at 50 DAB samplings in both 2015 (R² = 0.77) and 2014 (R² = 0.59). Thus, the leaf N concentration was suggested to be determined at 50 DAB by visible/near-infrared spectroscopy and the threshold should be 24-27 g/kg.	approximation error;artificial neural network;backpropagation;blood urea nitrogen measurement;calibration;coefficient of determination;eighty;gram per kilogram;neural network simulation;one thousand;orchard;partial least squares regression;performance;plant leaves;principal component regression;rca spectra 70;randomness;signal-to-noise ratio;software propagation;spectral method;spectroscopy, near-infrared;stellar classification;stepwise regression;triclosan 4.6 mg/ml medicated liquid soap	Jie Wang;Changwei Shen;Na Liu;Xin Jin;Xueshan Fan;Caixia Dong;Yangchun Xu	2017		10.3390/s17030538	chemistry;analytical chemistry	Vision	87.343368543571	-53.690019352473946	98601

One of the limitations is the lack of simultaneous nadir overpasses. Their measurements over a selected Earth view target have significant differences in solar and view angles, which magnify the effects of atmospheric scattering and bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). In this paper, an intercomparison technique is formulated after correction for site’s BRDF and atmospheric effects. The reflectance measurements over Libya desert sites 1, 2, and 4 from both the Aqua and Terra MODIS are regressed to a BRDF model with an adjustable coefficient accounting for calibration difference. The ratio between Aqua and Terra reflectance measurements is derived for bands 1–9 and the results from different sites show good agreement. For year 2003, the ratios are in the range of 0.985–1.010 for bands 1–9. Band 3 shows the lowest ratio 0.985 and band 1 shows the highest ratio 1.010. For the year 2014, the ratio ranges from approximately 0.983 for bands 2 and 1.012 for band 8. The BRDF corrected reflectance for the two instruments is also derived for every year from 2003 to 2014 for stability assessment. Bands 1 and 2 show greater than 1% differences between the two instruments. Aqua bands 1 and 2 show downward trends while Terra bands 1 and 2 show upward trends. Bands 8 and 9 of both Aqua and Terra show large variations of reflectance measurement over time.	aqua;bidirectional reflectance distribution function;coefficient;simultaneous multithreading	Tiejun Chang;Xiaoxiong Xiong;Amit Angal;Aisheng Wu;Xu Geng	2017	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2016.2641258	meteorology;atmospheric model;calibration;atmospheric sciences;scattering;computational model;physics;quantum mechanics;remote sensing	Vision	83.1822320665025	-63.02130527399596	98633

Consequently, significant effort is being invested in the use of satellite remote sensing to represent aspects of the proximate mechanisms (e.g., resource availability) that can be related to biodiversity surrogates (BS) such as species community descriptors. We explored the potential of very high resolution (VHR) satellite Earth observation (EO) features as proxies for habitat structural attributes that influence spatial variation in habitat quality and biodiversity change. In a semi-natural grassland mosaic of conservation concern in southern Italy, we employed a hierarchical nested sampling strategy to collect field and VHR-EO data across three spatial extent levels (landscape, patch and plot). Species incidence and abundance data were collected at the plot level for plant, insect and bird functional groups. Spectral and textural VHR-EO image features were derived from a Worldview-2 image. Three window sizes (grains) were tested for analysis and computation of textural features, guided by the perception limits of different organisms. The modelled relationships between VHR-EO features and BS responses differed across scales, suggesting that landscape, patch and plot levels are respectively most appropriate when dealing with birds, plants and insects. This research demonstrates the potential of VHR-EO for biodiversity mapping and habitat modelling, and highlights the importance of identifying the appropriate scale of analysis for specific taxonomic groups of interest. Further, textural features are important in the modelling of functional group-specific indices which represent BS in high conservation value habitat types, and provide a more direct link to species interaction networks and ecosystem functioning, than provided by traditional taxonomic diversity indices.	biodiversity informatics;computation;ecosystem;habitat;image resolution;incidence matrix;inline linking;nested sampling algorithm;proxy server;sampling (signal processing);semiconductor industry;spatial scale;surrogates	Paola Mairota;Barbara Cafarelli;Rocco Labadessa;Francesco P.

To further mitigate the RIEs, characterization and quantification of RIEs in bending angles have been performed by using end-to-end simulations. In this study, the seasonal characteristics of the RIEs in bending angles were analyzed by using larger ensembles of profiles from end-to-end simulations. The results indicated that the RIE is a major source of the bending angle in lower mesosphere and upper stratosphere (LMUS), and its bias has a clear negative tendency that in line with our previous studies. The preliminary analysis showed that, globally the average bias and standard deviation of RIEs changed slightly, while regionally they changed obviously. For the northern hemisphere middle latitude (NHM) region, the largest average bias and standard deviation of RIEs happened in summer, while the smallest ones happened in winter. This study helps to inform future RIE mitigation schemes for ensuring benchmark quality stratospheric RO data.	benchmark (computing);computer simulation;end-to-end principle;google cloud messaging;least-angle regression;numerical analysis;numerical weather prediction;radio occultation;reactive-ion etching;satellite navigation	Congliang Liu;Gottfried Kirchengast;Yueqiang Sun;Qifei Du;Weihua Bai;Xianya Wang;Xiangguang Meng;Junming Xia;Danyang Zhao;Yuerong Cai;Dongwei Wang;Chunjun Wu;Wei Li;Cheng Liu	2018	IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8517927	remote sensing;geodesy;bending;standard deviation;radio occultation;northern hemisphere;computer science;mesosphere;stratosphere;numerical weather prediction;atmospheric model	Arch	83.81046743009513	-65.65473799473267	99163

This paper presents an analysis of snow backscattering properties in eight test areas situated around weather stations. Test areas represent open and forested landscapes in Northern Finland. Analyses are carried out using an extensive multitemporal ERS-2 C-band SAR data set from the snow melt period. We validate the 1) forest backscattering model for forest compensation, 2) TKK fractional snow-covered area (SCA) method with m situ observations and 3) inversion of a combined forest/snow/ground backscattering model in an application to yield estimates of the relative changes of snow wetness during full snow cover conditions. The results show that the semi-empirical TKK backscattering model describes the average C-band backscattering properties of all test regions well as a function of forest stem volume. Comparison of SCA estimation results with available ground truth data also shows a good performance. The retrieved relative snow wetness values agree well with temperature observations.	backscatter (email);ground truth;semiconductor industry;situated	Jarkko Koskinen;Jouni Pulliainen;Kari Luojus;Matias Takala	2009	2009 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/TGRS.2009.2024755	meteorology;forest;performance;hydrology;landscape;backscatter;physics;remote sensing	Embedded	83.90596910080556	-63.58907098856547	99186
82520bdaa13da38cbce4ba6ff23dd8058f21794a	assessing terrestrial water storage and flood potential using grace data in the yangtze river basin, china		Floods have caused tremendous economic, societal and ecological losses in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) of China. To reduce the impact of these disasters, it is important to understand the variables affecting the hydrological state of the basin. In this study, we used Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data, flood potential index (FPI), precipitation data (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, TRMM 3B43), and other meteorological data to generate monthly terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA) and to evaluate flood potential in the YRB. The results indicate that the basin contained increasing amounts of water from 2003 to 2014, with a slight increase of 3.04 mm/year in the TWSA. The TWSA and TRMM data exhibit marked seasonal characteristics with summer peaks and winter dips. Estimates of terrestrial water storage based on GRACE, measured as FPI, are critical for understanding and predicting flooding. The 2010 flood (FPI ~0.36) was identified as the most serious disaster during the study period, with discharge and precipitation values 37.95% and 19.44% higher, respectively, than multi-year average values for the same period. FPI can assess reliably hydrological extremes with high spatial and temporal resolution, but currently, it is not suitable for smaller and/or short-term flood events. Thus, we conclude that GRACE data can be effectively used for monitoring and examining large floods in the YRB and elsewhere, thus improving the current knowledge and presenting potentially important political and economic implications.	anomaly detection;discharger;fixed-point iteration;flood;ibm tivoli workload scheduler;information explosion;terrestrial television;time series	Zhangli Sun;Xiufang Zhu;Yaozhong Pan;Jinshui Zhang	2017	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs9101011	geology;flood myth;climatology;china;hydrology;precipitation;water storage;drainage basin	HCI	83.71129632465576	-57.05824327229958	99265

Thus, there is a need for accurate, efficient, practical methodologies to estimate this biochemical parameter. Hyperspectral measurement is a means of quickly and nondestructively assessing leaf Anth in situ. Wet chemical methods has traditionally been used for this purpose. Recently, NIR(nearinfrared)/green, red/green, anthocyanin reflectance index(ARI), and a modified anthocyanin refelctance index(MARI) was been used to estimate the anthocyanin content. In this paper, a an artificial-intelligence technique model was introduced to establish the relationship between the anthocyanin content and reflectance of 400-750nm spectum, variation of species and growth stages. The objective of this study was to test the overall performance and accuracy of this new nondestructive techniques for estimating Anth content in grapevine leaves. Although Anth in validation data set was widely variable, the new methods were capable of accurate predicting Anth content in grapevine leaves with a root mean square error below 1.65 mg/m,which is lower than that of MARI or ARI [20]. It documents the facts that such an approach is more suitable for developing simple hand-held field instrumentation for accurate nondestructive Anth estimation and for analyzing digital airborne or satellite imagery to assist in making informed decisions vineyard management.	airborne ranger;artificial intelligence;linear model;mean squared error;mobile device;oren–nayar reflectance model	JiangLin Qin;Donald Rundquist;Anatoly A.

634d6e65f750d08c81be4d6234ff138151fc991d	emerging flood model validation frameworks for street-level inundation modeling with stormsense		Technological progress in flood monitoring and the proliferation of cost-efficient IoT-enabled water level sensors are enabling new streams of information for today's smart cities. StormSense is an inundation forecasting research initiative and an active participant in the GCTC seeking to enhance flood preparedness in the Hampton Roads region for flooding resulting from storm surge, rain, and tides and demonstrating replicability of the solution. Herein, we present street-level hydrodynamic modeling results at 5m resolution with conventional flood validation sources alongside new emergent techniques for validating model predictions during three prominent recent flooding events in Hampton Roads during Fall 2016: Hurricane Hermine, Tropical Storm Julia, and Hurricane Matthew. Emerging validation techniques include: (1) IoT-water level sensors, (2) crowd-sourced GPS maximum flood extent measurements, and (3) geospatial flooded area comparisons with drone-surveyed flood extents via ESRI's Drone2Map. Model uncertainty was validated against 5 newly-established tide gauges within the domain for an aggregate vertical root mean squared error of ±8.19 cm between the sensor observations and model predictions. Also, geospatial uncertainty was assessed using mean horizontal distance difference as ±4.97 m via 206 crowd-sourced GPS flood extents from the Sea Level Rise App.	aggregate data;cost efficiency;crowdsourcing;emergence;flood;global positioning system;julia;mean squared error;sensor;smart city	Jon Derek Loftis;Harry Wang;David Forrest;Sokwoo Rhee;Cuong Nguyen	2017		10.1145/3063386.3063764	environmental science;environmental planning;hydrology;geotechnical engineering	Mobile	85.1503501228419	-58.569678023308114	99679

Parameters describing the location and scale of the PDF are used as analogous of canopy height and canopy length respectively. Results suggest that, for a structurally homogenous forested scene, localised variance decreases for canopy height with increasing plot dimensions. The opposite is apparent for canopy length, it is suggested this is a result of a spatially heterogeneous understorey layer negatively skewing the distribution.	modifiable areal unit problem;motorola canopy;portable document format;star height	Phillip Wilkes;Simon D.

c21df945df099773978e7405357479f09867a220	temperature compensation for radiometric correction of terrestrial lidar intensity data	radiometry;reflectance;tls;lidar	Correction of terrestrial Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) intensity data has been increasingly studied in recent years. The purpose is to obtain additional insight into the scanned environment that is not available from the geometric information alone. Radiometric correction, as the name implies, corrects the received intensity to standard reflectance values in the range of (0, 1). This correction typically compensates for the dependence of angle and distance. This paper presents an additional compensation for temperature that may be necessary for some LiDAR instruments such as the Faro Focus3D X 330 laser scanner. It is also shown that temperature compensation is not necessary for the Riegl VZ–400. Another important contribution of this work is the verification of a previously published radiometric correction in different environments. The correction was applied to two different Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) instruments: a Faro Focus3D X 330 and Riegl VZ-400. Overall, the VZ-400, without temperature compensation, produced better results with a Root Mean Square (RMS) of the standard deviation of error being 0.053 and a RMS of the mean error of 0.036 compared to 0.069 and 0.046 for the Faro Focus3D X 330. It was found, for the case of the Faro device, that the temperature of the instrument played an important role in the accuracy of the results. The proposed temperature compensation method improved the RMS standard deviation of the error by 1.4 times and the RMS of the error by 2.6 times, compared to the uncompensated results.	incidence matrix;methods of computing square roots;terrestrial television	Angus F.

ccc445c2d2d732b88502d689344a8a3258ebf1ea	defining optimal dem resolutions and point densities for modelling hydrologically sensitive areas in agricultural catchments dominated by microtopography	diffuse pollution;critical source area;surface runoff;microtopography;dem;lidar	Defining critical source areas (CSAs) of diffuse pollution in agricultural catchments depends upon the accurate delineation of hydrologically sensitive areas (HSAs) at highest risk of generating surface runoff pathways. In topographically complex landscapes, this delineation is constrained by digital elevation model (DEM) resolution and the influence of microtopographic features. To address this, optimal DEM resolutions and point densities for spatially modelling HSAs were investigated, for onward use in delineating CSAs. The surface runoff framework was modelled using the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) and maps were derived from 0.25 m LiDAR DEMs (40 bare-earth points m−2), resampled 1 m and 2 m LiDAR DEMs, and a radar generated 5 m DEM. Furthermore, the resampled 1 m and 2 m LiDAR DEMs were regenerated with reduced bare-earth point densities (5, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25 and 0.125 points m−2) to analyse effects on elevation accuracy and important microtopographic features. Results were compared to surface runoff field observations in two 10 km2 agricultural catchments for evaluation. Analysis showed that the accuracy of modelled HSAs using different thresholds (5%, 10% and 15% of the catchment area with the highest TWI values) was much higher using LiDAR data compared to the 5 m DEM (70–100% and 10–84%, respectively). This was attributed to the DEM capturing microtopographic features such as hedgerow banks, roads, tramlines and open agricultural drains, which acted as topographic barriers or channels that diverted runoff away from the hillslope scale flow direction. Furthermore, the identification of ‘breakthrough’ and ‘delivery’ points along runoff pathways where runoff and mobilised pollutants could be potentially transported between fields or delivered to the drainage channel network was much higher using LiDAR data compared to the 5 m DEM (75–100% and 0–100%, respectively). Optimal DEM resolutions of 1–2 m were identified for modelling HSAs, which balanced the need for microtopographic detail as well as surface generalisations required to model the natural hillslope scale movement of flow. Little loss of vertical accuracy was observed in 1–2 m LiDAR DEMs with reduced bare-earth point densities of 2–5 points m−2, even at hedgerows. Further improvements in HSA models could be achieved if soil hydrological properties and the effects of flow sinks (filtered out in TWI models) on hydrological connectivity are also considered. © 2016 The Authors.

Bias uncertainty is currently the largest factor in altimetry error budgets. The EM bias in a bistatic forward-scattering configuration at L-band, such as in Global Navigation Satellite Systems Reflectometry (GNSS-R) altimetry, remains one of the major sources of uncertainty in the altimetry error budget. In this paper, the EM bias is computed using numerical simulations. To do so, a time-dependent synthetic non-Gaussian sea surface is created using the Pierson-Moskowitz and Elfouhaily sea surface height spectra and spreading function. The sea surface is then discretized in facets and “illuminated” using a right-hand circular polarization GNSS signal, previously recorded by an up-looking antenna connected to a data logger. The waves scattered from each facet are then computed using the physical optics method under the Kirchhoff approximation, and the radar cross section of each facet is computed. The scattered electric fields are “collected” by a down-looking left-hand circular polarization antenna, and the EM bias is computed based on its fundamental definition. The numerical model is validated against Millet's model (a combined model of the weakly non-linear and modulation transfer models) with real data at C- and Ku-bands. Then, the numerical model is applied at L-band, for bistatic configurations, including different azimuth angles and different wind speeds. It is found that the EM bias is almost insensitive to the sea surface spectra selected and increases with increasing wind speed and incidence/scattering angle (up to ~-20 cm at $\theta_{i,s}=45^{\circ}$ and $U_{10}=12\ \mbox{m/s}$), and it also exhibits a non-negligible azimuthal dependence, which must be accounted for in the error budgets of upcoming GNSS-R altimetry missions.	approximation;circular polarization;computation;computer simulation;cross section (geometry);data logger;discretization;incidence matrix;kirchhoff's theorem;ku band;l band;mathematical model;modulation;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;paul moskowitz;reflectometry;satellite navigation;synthetic intelligence	Ali Ghavidel;Domenico Schiavulli;Adriano Camps	2016	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2015.2460212	wind speed;meteorology;waves;global positioning system;elevation;geodesy;surface wave;altimeter;scattering;computational model;backscatter;physics;satellite;remote sensing	Visualization	83.22467487271703	-66.54733021458775	100881

In order to retrieve quantitative geophysical parameters over land surfaces using this instrument, a method is presented that applies a mixed-target modeling approach to estimate subpixel fractional vegetation cover at a regional scale. The model represents the footprint area as a combination of part dense, homogeneous vegetation and part bare soil (with homogeneous roughness and dielectric properties). Inversion of this model is then carried out using a retrieval procedure that incorporatesa priori information in a quantitative manner. The method is applied to the estimation of fractional cover over an area in Africa using WSC data from 1992 to 1995. Retrieved parameters are also compared to ground measurements made in the area during the 1992 Hapex–Sahel campaign. The procedure illustrates the applicability of WSC data for measuring geophysical parameters over land and offers the potential of deriving a physically-based alternative to empirical indices for estimating regionally-variable parameters.	incidence matrix;pixel;world sudoku championship	Iain H.

A previous study showed that minimum Land Surface Temperature (LST) derived from MODIS night-time images provides a good surrogate for minimum air temperature while the retrieval of maximum air temperature is less straightforward. The objective of this work is to estimate maximum air temperatures through the extrapolation of the minimum temperature derived from MODIS according to the diurnal cycle. The diurnal cycle parameters (i.e. phase and amplitude) which are used to estimate the maximum air temperature are determined locally using data from the WORDCLIM database. The proposed approach is applied over four different areas in Africa (Eritrea, Ethiopia, Botswana and Madagascar) based on measurements collected in 28 different stations over the period 2002–2008. An acceptable agreement between maximum air temperature estimated and observed temperatures was noticed. This implies that satellite imagery has an interesting potential in inferring maximum air temperature at an interesting temporal and spatial resolution.	extrapolation	Pietro Ceccato;Christelle Vancutsem;Marouane Temimi	2010	2010 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5649810	meteorology;sea surface temperature;atmospheric temperature;diurnal cycle;image resolution;temperature;temperature measurement;geology;temporal resolution;climatology;extrapolation;climate change;physics;remote sensing	Robotics	84.69738817061551	-61.827852665997206	101372

The composite sea surface is modeled as a superposition of large-scale gravity waves and small-scale ripples. Here, the elevation of the large-scale surface component, on which each small facet travels along a closed orbit under the condition of the first-order approximation, is described by the coordinates of the small facets. The predicted Doppler shifts are compared with the results obtained by the small perturbation method (SPM), the geometrical optics method, the first-order SSA (SSA-I), and the two-scale scattering method (TSM). We can find that the predicted Doppler shifts for SPM and SSA-I in copolarized configuration are insensitive to the polarization state. However, the results obtained by SSA-II are consistent with those obtained by TSM and yield significant differences between HH and VV polarizations. Spectrum bandwidth is mainly induced by sea-surface orbit motions. In this paper, the formula of the spectrum bandwidth for the scattered echoes from the composite sea surface is also derived on the basis of TSM. The predicted bandwidths are compared with the Monte Carlo simulated results and the measured data. Furthermore, the dependences of the Doppler shift and the bandwidth on the parameters, such as the polarization, wind speed, radar frequency, etc., are also discussed.	doppler echocardiography;doppler effect;first-order predicate;ibm spectrum protect (tivoli storage manager);incidence matrix;monte carlo method;order of approximation;polarization (waves);quantum superposition;radar;shadow mapping;super paper mario;verification and validation	Yunhua Wang;Yanmin Zhang	2011	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2010.2070071	geodesy;surface wave;optics;physics;quantum mechanics;statistics;monte carlo method	Visualization	83.11026991215047	-66.76429885242366	101476

Recent trend analyses have indicated general greening trends in this region. The region has experienced mild climate change, and yet significant land use changes, such as afforestation and reforestation. In addition, out-migration has occurred. Whether climate change or human-induced factors, i.e., ecological afforestation projects and out-migration have primarily promoted forest restoration in this region was investigated in this study, using Guizhou Province as the study area. Based on Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data, we found general greening trends of the forest from 2000 to 2010. About 89% of the forests have experienced an increase in the annual NDVI, and among which, about 41% is statistically significant. For the summer season, more than 65% of the forests have increases in summer NDVI, and about 16% of the increases are significant. The strongest greening trends mainly occurred in the karst areas. Meanwhile, annual average and summer average temperature in this region have increased and the precipitation in most of the region has decreased, although most of these changes were not statistically significant (p > 0.1). A site-based regression analysis using 19 climate stations with minimum land use OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2014, 6 9896 changes showed that a warming climate coupled with a decrease in precipitation explained some of the changes in the forest NDVI, but the results were not conclusive. The major changes were attributed to human-induced factors, especially in the karst areas. The implications of an ecological afforestation project and out-migration for forest restoration were also discussed, and the need for further investigations at the household level to better understand the out-migration–environment relationship was identified.	circuit restoration;the forest	Hongyan Cai;Xiaohuan Yang;Kejing Wang;Linlin Xiao	2014	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs6109895	dynamics;hydrology;human migration;climatology;environmental degradation;pattern;climate change;ecology;physics;satellite	HCI	83.5675556112103	-56.48691386707259	101748
90359690b09394cf06b873044fabbdb857186d0e	drought forecasting with vegetation temperature condition index using arima models in the guanzhong plain	vegetation temperature condition index;drought forecasting;guanzhong plain;arima	This paper works on the agricultural drought forecasting in the Guanzhong Plain of China using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models based on the time series of drought monitoring results of Vegetation Temperature Condition Index (VTCI). About 90 VTCI images derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data were selected to develop the ARIMA models from the erecting stage to the maturity stage of winter wheat (early March to late May in each year at a ten-day interval) of the years from 2000 to 2009. We take the study area overlying on the administration map around the study area, and divide the study area into 17 parts where at least one weather station is located in each part. The pixels where the 17 weather stations are located are firstly chosen and studied for their fitting models, and then the best models for all pixels of the whole area are determined. According to the procedures for the models’ development, the selected best models for the 17 pixels are identified and the forecast is done with three steps. The forecasting results of the ARIMA models were compared with the monitoring ones. The results show that with reference to the categorized VTCI drought monitoring results, the categorized forecasting results of the ARIMA models are in good agreement with the monitoring ones. The categorized drought forecasting results of the ARIMA models are more severity in the northeast of the Plain in April 2009, which are in good agreements with the monitoring ones. The absolute errors of the AR(1) models are lower than the SARIMA models, both in the frequency distributions and in the statistic results. However, the ability of SARIMA models to detect the changes of the drought situation is better than the AR(1) models. These results indicate that the ARIMA models can better forecast the category and extent of droughts and can be applied to forecast droughts in the Plain.	autocorrelation;autoregressive integrated moving average;autoregressive model;capability maturity model;categorization;han unification;pixel;seasonality;system identification;time series	Miao Tian;Pengxin Wang;Jahangir Khan	2016	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs8090690	meteorology;autoregressive integrated moving average;hydrology;climatology;statistics	AI	84.91429039884581	-57.32597963706735	101894

High-frequency passive microwave radiometer sensitivity of the roughness is very low, traditional ground truth can’t provide an accurate large-scale roughness of pixel information, and active radar and scatterometer data for roughness of the high sensitivity, active and passive joint inversion of soil volumetric water content is the current hot research. The main objective of this research is to develop a suitable method instead of some traditional methods for the retrieval of SM and other parameters at large-scale, which is based on the synergistic use of AMSR-E and Quikscat/SeaWinds observations. Quikscat / SeaWinds can provide large-scale scatterometer data, first used in this study to establish AIEM simulation and backscattering coefficient of roughness between, and then estimate the roughness of the known information as auxiliary inversion surface AMSR-E temperature and soil volumetric water content. The retrieval results show that this proposed method is helpful to achieve a higher accuracy in the study region of Maqu.	channel (communications);coefficient;dvd region code;ground truth;microwave;osi model;pixel;simulation;sparse matrix;synergy	Ruofei Zhong;Jianxi Huang;Jiangxia Wei;Qin Li;Jiao Guo;Wei Su	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-27278-3_44	meteorology;geography;hydrology;remote sensing	Vision	84.3204827169136	-63.96511611856582	102453

This is quantified using the plant physiological concept of isohydricity. VOD-derived effective ecosystem-scale isohydricity maps have recently become commonly used, but their sensitivity to the underlying VOD datasets is not yet well understood. In this work, the dependence of the isohydricity calculation on assumptions about canopy cover penetration - which depends on frequency - and observation time - which varies by sensor in a manner roughly consistent with the observation frequency - are reviewed, and isohydricity datasets from different VOD datasets are compared and validated.	ecosystem;map;microwave;motorola canopy;versant object database	Alexandra Georges Konings;Mostafa Momen	2018	IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8519441	vegetation;remote sensing;water content;computer science;optical depth;light scattering;microwave	Embedded	85.0529560503545	-62.615852341822105	102754

However, rapid response of vegetation following fire and frequent cloud cover pose challenges to this approach in the southeastern US. We assessed these timing constraints by using a series of Landsat TM images to determine how rapidly the remotely sensed burn scar signature fades following prescribed burns in wet flatwoods and depression swamp community types in the Apalachicola National Forest, Florida, USA during 2006. We used both the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) of reflectance bands sensitive to vegetation and exposed soil cover, as well as the change in NBR from before to after fire (dNBR), to estimate burned area. We also determined the average and maximum amount of time following fire required to obtain a cloud-free image for burns in each month of the year, as well as the predicted effect of this time lag on percent accuracy of burn scar estimates. Using both NBR and dNBR, the detectable area decreased linearly 9% per month on average over the first four months following fire. Our findings suggest that the NBR and dNBR methods for monitoring burned area in common southeastern US vegetation community types are limited to an average of 78–90% accuracy among months of the year, with individual burns having values as low as 38%, if restricted to use of Landsat 5 TM imagery. However, the majority of burns can still be mapped at accuracies similar to those OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2011, 3 1681 in other regions of the US, and access to additional sources of satellite imagery would improve overall accuracy.	image resolution;mapper;xml:tm	Joshua J.

Here, we adopt a new infrared extrapolation method to extend the existing turbid water atmospheric correction of the operational land imager (OLI) data on Landsat-8 platform. The atmospheric correction uses the extrapolated Rayleigh-corrected reflectance at NIR and SWIR bands to derive the ratios of NIR to SWIR and visible aerosol single-scattering contributions (aerosol epsilon). Taking the Pearl River Estuary as an example, the magnitude and spatial distribution of reflectance from OLI compare well with those of concurrent moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer /Aqua based on SWIRE atmospheric correction method. The linear regression coefficients between the resampled OLI and Aqua data have demonstrated the proposed atmospheric correction method can provide robust and realistic reflectance. The advantages of the high spatial resolution made the OLI data a good source for applications in coastal and estuarine waters.	aerosol dose form;aqua;arabic numeral 0;assumed;bands;chow–liu tree;coefficient;crocodylus porosus;embryophyta;estuaries;extrapolation;guided imagery;image sensor;imager device component;magnetic resonance imaging;rayleigh–ritz method;regression analysis;spectroscopy, near-infrared;water	Haibin Ye;Chuqun Chen;Chaoyu Yang	2017	IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing	10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2614814	meteorology;atmospheric model;hydrology;earth;physics;satellite;remote sensing	AI	83.88006080343648	-61.35965031796047	102905

During the early, exploration stage, the hard data (coring, well testing and well log) often come only from several wells with large well spacing. Though soft data (such as geophysical and geological interpretation, outcrop and seismic data) can be taken into consideration, it is still problematic to characterize a formation by deterministic Kriging or probabilistic simulation, because the formation property spatial variability in different directions is hard to capture by sparse hard data and soft data, especially in lateral direction.

436f6ffe339aa06f56a3b4407a5c46b63587196d	inventory of carbon sequestration in artemisia lands of hamadan province		Climate change is one of the most important challenges in sustainable development which has negative effect on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem. The lead factor of this phenomenon is Co2 accumulation in atmosphere. One of the suitable ways of facing the mentioned issue is carbon sequestration in plant biomass and soil as a simple as well as inexpensive refined way in rangelands. With respect to the fact that Artemisia lands occupy an extensive part of the rangelands in Iran, in order to investigate the role of Artemisia lands in carbon sequestration, an area of Artemisia sieberi vegetation type in Hamadan province was selected and the content of aboveground and underground biomass carbon and soil organic carbon was determined. The result showed that the total carbon sequestration per hectare was 287.49 kg/ha and 90% of total carbon sequestration was soil organic carbon. The results of biomass carbon distribution showed that the carbon content in aerial biomass was more than underground biomass. Among the different parts of aerial biomass, the greatest storage was related to foliage carbon. Within proper range management in rangeland ecosystems, a major step forward in rising plant biomass could be taken. On the other hand, any attempt to restore lost natural resources could increase carbon sequestration.	aerial photography;aquatic ecosystem;carbon cycle;dark lands;terrestrial television;tree accumulation	Seyed Akbar Javadi;Ghavamodin Zahedi Amiri;Mohamad Naderi;Faranak Raoofi	2011			ecosystem;soil carbon;aquatic ecosystem;rangeland;vegetation type;geography;biomass;carbon sequestration;carbon;agroforestry		84.7323591004284	-53.7310437990556	103801
08edf619f00347b98a2d61d3acda26f76f709285	the relationship between an invasive shrub and soil moisture: seasonal interactions and spatially covarying relations	invasive shrub;spatially covarying;seasonal interactions;soil moisture	Recent studies indicate that positive relationships between invasive plants and soil can contribute to further plant invasions. However, it remains unclear whether these relations remain unchanged throughout the growing season. In this study, spatial sequences of field observations along a transect were used to reveal seasonal interactions and spatially covarying relations between one common invasive shrub (Tartarian Honeysuckle, Lonicera tatarica) and soil moisture in a tall grassland habitat. Statistical analysis over the transect shows that the contrast between soil moisture in shrub and herbaceous patches vary with season and precipitation. Overall, a negatively covarying relationship between shrub and soil moisture (i.e., drier surface soils at shrub microsites) exists during the very early growing period (e.g., May), while in summer a positively covarying phenomenon (i.e., wetter soils under shrubs) is usually evident, but could be weakened or vanish during long precipitation-free periods. If there is sufficient rainfall, surface soil moisture and leaf area index (LAI) often spatially covary with significant spatial oscillations at an invariant scale (which is governed by the shrub spatial pattern and is about 8 m), but their phase relation in space varies with season, consistent with the seasonal variability of the co-varying phenomena between shrub invasion and soil water content. The findings are important for establishing a more complete picture of how shrub invasion affects soil moisture.	habitat;interaction;spatial variability;spatiotemporal pattern	Yuhong He	2014	ISPRS Int.

However, thermal infrared remote sensing is easily affected by weather conditions because of the short wavelength of infrared radiation. In this paper, instead of infrared radiation, we focus on the microwave radiation characteristics of loaded rock. First, a microwave observation system was built to observe the loading process of rocks in an outdoor environment with a cold sky background. Then, the microwave radiation changes in the loaded granite samples during elastic deformation and fracturing stages were analyzed. The experiments yielded the following results. First, the microwave brightness temperature has a linear positive correlation with the load in the elastic deformation stage of the granite samples, and lateral pressure accelerates the changes in the microwave radiation. Second, the microwave brightness temperature usually decreases as the rock develops layered fractures but increases as the rock develops surface fractures, which significantly alter the surface morphology and roughness. The mechanisms responsible for the changes in microwave radiation during the rock deformation and fracturing processes are discussed. This study demonstrates the potential ability to use microwave-sensing satellites to observe seismogenic processes and earthquakes.	experiment;lateral thinking;mathematical morphology;microwave;model-based testing;pet rock	Shanjun Liu;Zhongyin Xu;Jialei Wei;Jianwei Huang;Lixin Wu	2016	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2016.2569419	geophysics;temperature measurement;geology;physics;quantum mechanics;remote sensing	Visualization	85.31011346176881	-65.15722106293072	104353
a62e1d290845bec67b15ebd70977d6d23f0ee21d	comparison of artificial neural network and multivariate regression models for prediction of azotobacteria population in soil under different land uses		Abstract Azotobacteria are one of the most important and beneficial soil bacteria which their number and distribution are affected by physicochemical and biological properties of soil and land usage. The aim of this study was to evaluate the population of Azotobacter in soils with different land uses and relationship between population size and some physicochemical and biological properties of soil by using artificial neural network (ANN) and multivariate linear regression (MLR) methods. In total, 50 soil samples were collected from depth (0–25 cm) under different land uses located in East Azerbaijan, Ardabil and Gilan provinces, Iran. Population of Azotobacter was separately counted in Winogradsky and LG media by preparation of serial dilution and plate counts. In addition, soil texture, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), carbonate calcium equivalent (CCE), organic carbon (TOC), cold water extractable OC (CWEOC), hot water extractable OC (HWEOC), light fraction OC (LFOC), heavy fraction OC (HFOC), basal respiration (BR) and substrate induced respiration (SIR), the number of bacteria, fungi and actinomycete were measured in three replicates in each soil sample. To predict Azotobacteria population based on easily measurable characteristics of soil properties, MLR analysis and ANN model (feed-forward back propagation network) were used. In order to assess the models, root mean square error (RMSE) and R 2 were used. The R 2 and RMSE values for population of Azotobacter in Winogradsky medium obtained by ANN model with SIR, EC, CCE, sand and silt as entered variables were 0.76 and 0.36, respectively, and for population of Azotobacter in LG medium, were 0.45 and 0.50, respectively. Using MLR the R 2 value for population of Azotobacter in WG and LG media was 0.63 and 0.39, respectively. Results showed that ANN with eight neurons in hidden layer had better performance in predicting population of Azotobacter in WG than MLR.	artificial neural network;general linear model	Mitra Ebrahimi;Ali Akbar Safari Sinegani;Mohammad Reza Sarikhani;Seyed Abolghasem Mohammadi	2017	Computers and Electronics in Agriculture	10.1016/j.compag.2017.06.019	population size;computer vision;soil science;artificial intelligence;soil texture;engineering;soil water;multivariate statistics;silt;environmental engineering;soil test;azotobacter;population	ML	86.52571507533432	-54.746798516721135	104539
1601142c30c21b1ae2683da36e198a4d6ef5c36c	dynamic assessment of soil erosion risk using landsat tm and hj satellite data in danjiangkou reservoir area, china	danjiangkou reservoir;landsat tm and hj data;erosion risk;erosion changing trend	Danjiangkou reservoir area is the main water source and the submerged area of the Middle Route South-to-North Water Transfer Project of China. Soil erosion is a factor that significantly influences the quality and transfer of water from the Danjiangkou reservoir. The objective of this study is to assess the water erosion (rill and sheet erosion) risk and dynamic change trend of spatial distribution in erosion status and intensity between 2004 and 2010 in the Danjiangkou reservoir area using a multicriteria evaluation method.The multicriteria evaluation method synthesizes the vegetation fraction cover, slope gradient, and land use. Based on the rules and erosion risk assessment results of the study area in 2004 and 2010, the research obtained the conservation priority map. This study result shows an improvement in erosion status of the study area, the eroded area decreased from 32.1% in 2004 to 25.43% in 2010. The unchanged regions dominated the study area and that the total area of improvement grade erosion was larger than that of deterioration grade erosion. The severe, more severe, and extremely severe areas decreased by 4.71%, 2.28%, and 0.61% of the total study area, respectively. The percentages of regions where erosion grade transformed from extremely severe to slight, light and moderate were 0.18%, 0.02%, and 0.30%, respectively. However, a deteriorated region with a 2,897.60 km area was still observed. This area cannot be ignored in the determination of a general governance scheme. The top two conservation priority levels cover almost all regions with severe erosion and prominent increase in erosion risk, OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2013, 5 3827 accounting for 7.31% of the study area. The study results can assist government agencies in decision making for determining erosion control areas, starting regulation projects, and making soil conservation measures.	erosion (morphology);gradient;heterojunction;risk assessment	Lihui Wang;Jinliang Huang;Yun Du;Yanxia Hu;Pengpeng Han	2013	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs5083826	hydrology	HCI	83.62630384698177	-55.51757812776983	105063

The EFA results showed the monitoring stations to be distinguished by two main factors. The representative stations of which the variance was almost explained by the specific factor were selected. We applied PCA to the monitoring data of representative stations, and then analyzed the EOF-patterns that indicate the characteristics of water-quality variation for each factor. With the interpretation of main factors and EOF-patterns causing dominant water quality variations, the monitoring network of Nakdong River could be spatially and seasonally evaluated according to the contribution of each factor. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

775596a42f887e8e0bc1ee99fe84dde52c0c7732	an improved method for producing high spatial-resolution ndvi time series datasets with multi-temporal modis ndvi data and landsat tm/etm+ images	data fusion;ndvi time series;linear mixing model;modis;landsat tm etm	Due to technical limitations, it is impossible to have high resolution in both spatial and temporal dimensions for current NDVI datasets. Therefore, several methods are developed to produce high resolution (spatial and temporal) NDVI time-series datasets, which face some limitations including high computation loads and unreasonable assumptions. In this study, an unmixing-based method, NDVI Linear Mixing Growth Model (NDVI-LMGM), is proposed to achieve the goal of accurately and efficiently blending MODIS NDVI time-series data and multi-temporal Landsat TM/ETM+ images. This method firstly unmixes the NDVI temporal changes in MODIS time-series to different land cover types and then uses unmixed NDVI temporal changes to predict Landsat-like NDVI dataset. The test over a forest site shows high accuracy (average difference: −0.0070; average absolute difference: 0.0228; and average absolute relative difference: 4.02%) and computation efficiency of NDVI-LMGM (31 seconds using a personal computer). Experiments over more complex landscape and long-term time-series demonstrated that NDVI-LMGM performs well in each stage of vegetation growing season and is robust in regions with contrasting spatial and spatial variations. Comparisons OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2015, 7 7866 between NDVI-LMGM and current methods (i.e., Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM), Enhanced STARFM (ESTARFM) and Weighted Linear Model (WLM)) show that NDVI-LMGM is more accurate and efficient than current methods. The proposed method will benefit land surface process research, which requires a dense NDVI time-series dataset with high spatial resolution.	algorithmic efficiency;alpha compositing;computation;downscaling;ecosystem;experiment;futures studies;image resolution;linear model;linear system;personal computer;pixel;relative change and difference;time series	Yuhan Rao;Xiaolin Zhu;Jin Chen;Jianmin Wang	2015	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs70607865	meteorology;computer vision;hydrology;sensor fusion;remote sensing	Vision	84.73632765547994	-59.66486533055852	105314

Unfortunately the thermal structure in the upper 10 m of the ocean is complex and highly variable, so SST may be significantly different depending on the vertical depth of the in situ measurement, the local time of day, local conditions at the air-sea interface and the instrument used. In this context, the validation of the AVHRR/3 and MODIS atmospheric correction algorithms for the retrieval of sea surface temperature from the Canary Islands-Azores-Gibraltar area is performed by using in situ temperature measurements, derived from the ARGO data collection system and by the oceanographic service of the University of Las Palmas Gran Canaria, over the period from December 2000 to September 2003. The improvements and restrictions introduced in the systematic procedure to generate the match-up database have lead to a very high quality comparison data set. Finally, error analysis shows that SST can be retrieved with accuracies better than 0.6degC and, specifically, the MODIS mid-infrared algorithm achieves an excellent performance at night-time with accuracies to the order of 0.35degC	algorithm;display resolution;error analysis (mathematics)	Javier Marcello;Francisco Eugenio;Alonso Hernandez-Guerra	2004	IGARSS 2004. 2004 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2004.1368535	meteorology;sea surface temperature;climatology;physics;quantum mechanics;remote sensing	Visualization	82.92380042598134	-61.05048502465474	105458

If seasonally persistent, these events and their associated blooms of microorganisms can ultimately lead to a transient enrichment of local marine life, but also have the potential to produce subsequent depressed levels of dissolved oxygen due to increased rates of organic consumption and decay. The anoxic conditions thus created can be very harmful to indigenous benthic biota. This study examines sea surface temperature image data to determine the presence of upwelling events along the coastline of North Carolina, specifically at Cape Hatteras and Duck Pier, and establishes correlation with archived wind data and topographic highs as revealed by the most current NOAA Hydrographic charts of the two locations. The wind direction and average wind speed were found to be good indicators of upwelling events. However, wind direction was found to have greater influence on the occurrence of coastal upwelling. The portion of the North Carolina coast, from Cape Hatteras to Duck Pier, is oriented slightly southeast to northwest; therefore, coastal upwelling were driven by seasonal winds out of the South to Southeast. There exist a highly significant correlation between upwelling events and persistent wind direction as well as with topographic highs, which are means to alert marine authorities, marine agricultural interests, and the public to the possible risk of anoxic events which might do considerable harm to the local shell or sport fishing industry. The results of this study conducted as a part of the Office of Naval Research Undergraduate Research Experience (URE) in ocean and marine science will be presented. INTRODUCTION Observations of coastal upwelling of cold, nutrient rich, oceanic water have been reported along the Mid Atlantic Bight, specifically the coastlines of New Jersey and Long Island (Neuman, 1996, & Glenn et al. 1996). Analysis has indicated that upwelling along the coast of NJ and other coastal regions, wherein cold bottom water displaces warmer surface water, occur on the down-slope side of topographic “highs” or shallow ocean bottom ridge-lines (Glenn et al, 1996). The events themselves are apparently triggered by persistent surface winds blowing out of the South with a component parallel to the local shoreline. In the case of the southwest to northeast running the New Jersey coast, this is most typically seen during periods of southwesterly winds. In the case of the East to West oriented Long Island bight, upwelling seems to accompany winds out of the West. The portion of the North Carolina Bight South of the Chesapeake Bay entrance and northward of Cape Hatteras, is oriented slightly southeast to northwest therefore, coastal upwelling is expected to be driven by seasonal winds out of the South to Southeast. If such events do occur, they might also occur downwind of topographic highs similar to the upwelling events seen further north. Another geographic similarity between the Jersey Shore and Northeast North Carolina coastline that may impact upwelling phenomena is the proximity to the large drainage plumes of the Hudson River and the Chesapeake Bay that flow out into continental shelf waters and may influence coastal upwelling dynamics. Coastal upwelling events dramatically lower water temperature, bring nutrients to the surface and thereby enhance biological productivity. However, enhanced biological productivity can also lead to massive phytoplankton or algal blooms resulting in anoxic conditions and the subsequent collapse of the local ecosystem. There is a lack of published data on the occurrence of upwelling events and of the biological implications along the North Carolina coast. The current study lays the foundation for future research at this location. This study examines historical satellite sea surface temperature image data to determine the presence of local upwelling events and investigates possible correlations with archived wind data and bathymetric 2594 0-7803-9050-4/05/$20.00 ©2005 IEEE. 2594 data and proposes that wind direction takes prevalence over wind speed in determining upwelling events. BACKGROUND Generally on the east coast of the United Sates, parallel-shore southerly winds initiate coastal upwelling during summer months. (Neuman, 1996). As indicated in Figures 1, along shore winds drive net movement of water offshore resulting in the displacement of cold, subsurface waters to the surface (Figure 2). Similar historical analysis of North Carolina coastal waters has not been previously made. This phenomena is further illustrated in Figure 2. Figure 1. The net flow of water to the right of the wind in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left of the wind in the Southern Hemisphere as a result of the Coriolis effect.	archive;bathymetry;chart;displacement mapping;duck, duck, goose;ecosystem;gene ontology term enrichment;hudson;inferring horizontal gene transfer;köppen climate classification;topography;word lists by frequency	Jenelle J.

The main strengths and weaknesses of the various methods are identified and critically discussed. Such models combine an adequate sea surface description with advanced electromagnetic theories to simulate both monostatic and bistatic scattering for a wide range of wind speeds, radar frequencies, incidence angles, different polarizations and arbitrary radar look direction with respect to the wind direction. Theoretical calculations for co-polar signals in C-band and Ku-band are in good overall agreement with the experimental data represented by the empirical models, CMOD5 and NSCAT, with the exception of HH-polarization at high incidence angles (above 40°). A parametric analysis on the sea surface spectrum, will demonstrate that the discrepancy between the measured and the simulated HH normalized radar cross-sections, is only in part due to the inefficiency of the spectrum and mostly due to additional scattering contribution from breaking waves, not taken into account by the most common analytical scattering theories.	approximation algorithm;discrepancy function;fitness approximation;incidence matrix;ku band;l band;microwave;polarization (waves);radar;simulation;surface wave;theory	Franco Fois;Peter Hoogeboom;Francois Le Chevalier;Ad Stoffelen	2014	2014 IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2014.6947457	meteorology;scattering theory;scattering length;optics;scattering;physics;remote sensing	Embedded	83.00550478706981	-66.74980567105895	106273

The objectives of this study were to develop, improve and validate a scale independent biomass model. Field studies were conducted in Huimin County, Shandong Province of China, during the 2006–2007 growing season of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The field design had a multiscale set-up with four levels which differed in their management, such as nitrogen fertilizer inputs and cultivars, to create different biomass conditions: small experimental fields (L1), large experimental fields (L2), small farm fields (L3), and large farm fields (L4). L4, planted with different winter wheat varieties, was managed according to farmers’ practice while L1 through L3 represented controlled field experiments. Multitemporal spectral measurements were taken in the fields, and biomass was sampled for each spectral campaign. In addition, multitemporal Hyperion data were obtained in 2006 and 2007. L1 field data were used to develop biomass models based on the relation between the winter wheat spectra and biomass: several published vegetation indices, including NRI, REP, OSAVI, TCI, and NDVI, were investigated. A new hyperspectral vegetation index, which uses a four-band combination in the NIR and SWIR domains, named GnyLi, was developed. Following the multiscale concept, the data of higher levels (L2 through L4) were used stepwise to validate and improve the models of the lower levels, and to transfer the improved models to the next level. Lastly, the models were transferred and validated at the regional scale using Hyperion images of 2006 and 2007. The results showed that the GnyLi and NRI models, which were based on the NIR and SWIR domains, performed best with R2 > 0.74. All the other indices explained less than 60% model variability. Using the Hyperion data for regionalization, GnyLi and NRI explained 81–89% of the biomass variability. These results highlighted that GnyLi and NRI can be used together with hyperspectral images for both plot and regional level biomass estimation. Nevertheless, additional studies and analyses are needed to test its replicability in other environmental conditions.		Martin Gnyp;Georg Bareth;Fei Li;Victoria I. S.

dc44f049a205118d4601d5d6329f29e596f5021c	influence of ecological factors on estimation of impervious surface area using landsat 8 imagery		Estimation of impervious surface area is important to the study of urban environments and social development, but surface characteristics, as well as the temporal, spectral, and spatial resolutions of remote sensing images, influence the estimation accuracy. To investigate the effects of regional environmental characteristics on the estimation of impervious surface area, we divided China into seven sub-regions based on climate, soil type, feature complexity, and vegetation phenology: arid and semi-arid areas, Huang-Huai-Hai winter wheat production areas, typical temperate regions, the Pearl River Delta, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, typical tropical and subtropical regions, and the Qinghai Tibet Plateau. Impervious surface area was estimated from Landsat 8 images of five typical cities, including Yinchuan, Shijiazhuang, Shenyang, Ningbo, and Kunming. Using the linear spectral unmixing method, impervious and permeable surface areas were determined at the pixel-scale based on end-member proportions. We calculated the producer’s accuracy, user’s accuracy, and overall accuracy to assess the estimation accuracy, and compared the accuracies among images acquired from different seasons and locations. In tropical and subtropical regions, vegetation canopies can confound the identification of impervious surfaces and, thus, images acquired in winter, early spring, and autumn are most suitable; estimations in the Pearl River Delta, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River are influenced by soil, vegetation phenology, vegetation canopy, and water, and images acquired in spring, summer, and autumn provide the best results; in typical temperate areas, images acquired from spring to autumn are most effective for estimations; in winter wheat-growing areas, images acquired throughout the year are suitable; and in arid and semi-arid areas, summer and early autumn, during which vegetation is abundant, are the optimal seasons for estimations. Knowledge of optimal time frames, multi-source data, and intelligent algorithms should be integrated to reduce spectral confusion and improve the estimation of impervious surface area from Landsat 8 OLI imagery.	arid;algorithm;ecology;motorola canopy;multi-source;pixel;semiconductor industry;source data;time series	Yuqiu Jia;Lina Tang;Lin Wang	2017	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs9070751	remote sensing;vegetation;soil type;geology;subtropics;river delta;impervious surface;arid;temperate climate;phenology	HCI	84.22140479911478	-58.059242171756814	106727

To date, procedures to acquire, transform, and display meteorological information geographically have been specifically tailored to individual studies. Here we offer a flexible, integrated system that employs a relational database to store point information, a modular system incorporating a choice of weather data interpolation methods, and a matrix inversion method that speeds computer calculations to display information on grids of any specified size, all with minimal user intervention. We demonstrate the power of this integrated approach by cross-validating projected daily meteorological surfaces derived from w1200 weather stations distributed across the continental United States for a year. We performed cross-validations for five meteorological variables (solar radiation, minimum and maximum temperatures, humidity, and precipitation) with a truncated Gaussian filter, ordinary kriging and inverse distance weighting and achieved comparable success among all interpolation methods. Cross-validation computation time for ordinary kriging was reduced from 1 h to 3 min when we incorporated the matrix inversion method. We demonstrated the system’s flexibility by displaying results at 8-km resolution for the continental USA and at one-degree resolution for the globe. 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

a7fb99289b55e82b82d54f336cd41523c426c272	investigation of smap active–passive downscaling algorithms using combined sentinel-1 sar and smap radiometer data		The aim of this paper was to test the capabilities of the Sentinel-1 radar data in downscaling Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) radiometer data for high-resolution soil moisture estimation. Three different active–passive downscaling algorithms, including the brightness temperature-based downscaling algorithm (BTBDA), the soil moisture-based downscaling algorithm (SMBDA), and a change detection method (CDM), were analyzed using pairs of Sentinel-1 active and SMAP passive observations collected over a semiarid landscape in southeastern Australia from May 2015 to May 2016. While these algorithms have been tested previously, this is the first study to evaluate the three algorithms using real Sentinel-1 radar and SMAP radiometer data. The SMAP passive observations were disaggregated to 9-, 3-, and 1-km scales and then compared with ground soil moisture measurements. The results suggest that the root-mean-square error (RMSE) in downscaled soil moisture at 9-km resolution was 0.057, 0.056, and 0.067 cm3/cm3 for the BTBDA, SMBDA, and CDM, respectively. The accuracy of downscaling methods was generally decreased when applied at the finer spatial resolution. The SMBDA had overall better performance in terms of correctly detecting the soil moisture pattern and relatively lower RMSE values, and is, therefore, recommended for the combined Sentinel-1 radar and SMAP radiometer setup for soil moisture monitoring. The influence of incidence angle normalization of Sentinel-1 SAR data on downscaled soil moisture was also investigated and found to be minimal.	advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer;algorithm;angularjs;baseline (configuration management);downscaling;futures studies;image resolution;incidence matrix;mean squared error;pixel;radar;sensor;spatial scale;spatial variability;trionic	Lian He;Yang Hong;Xiaoling Wu;Nan Ye;Jeffrey P.

RAPID is used to generate a lookup table of bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) elements required by VLIDORT for the surface boundary condition. To test the RAPID–VLIDORT model, we used five natural 3-D scenes along with five aerosol optical depths (AODs). Results for top-of-atmosphere radiances show semiempirical analytical BRDF models are insufficiently accurate to represent bidirectional reflectance factors (BRFs) in hotspot regions and over wide angular variations. The large impact of AOD on BRF hotspot also underlines the importance of precise atmospheric corrections for multiangular remote sensing of the earth’s surface.	angularjs;bidirectional reflectance distribution function;java hotspot virtual machine;land surface model (lsm version 1.0);lookup table;passive optical network;rapid;radiosity (computer graphics);semi-empirical quantum chemistry method	Huaguo Huang;Wenhan Qin;Robert J.

In past decades, passive microwave remote sensing offers a good opportunity for obtaining SSM on a global scale, and many downscaling methods have been proposed using the triangle-based empirical soil moisture relationship models to overcome the limitation of coarse spatial resolution of its SSM products for regional applications. This paper aimed to examine and compare the effectiveness of five typical triangle-based empirical soil moisture relationship models for estimating SSM with Landsat-5 data and in situ measurements from the Maqu network on the northeastern part of the Tibetan Plateau for nine cloud-free days. The results showed that the model that treats the SSM as a second-order polynomial with land surface temperature, vegetation indices (VIs), and surface albedo as inputs exhibited the best performance compared with the results of other models. The VI comparison indicated that the use of the normalized difference VI or the fractional vegetation cover in this model outperformed other VIs, with the root-mean-square deviation of approximately 0.055 m3/m3 and the coefficient of determination ( $\text{R}^{2}$ ) above 0.78 at the nine-day average level. In addition, a significant spatial scale effect of the model was also found through analyzing the model fitting results at different window sizes. The study provides important insight into the best empirical relationship models for capturing soil moisture dynamics. These models can support the passive microwave soil moisture data spatial downscaling and validation applications in future studies.	coefficient of determination;curve fitting;downscaling;fingerprint verification competition;futures studies;microwave;performance evaluation;pixel;polynomial;quadratic function;spatial scale	Wei Zhao;Ainong Li;Huaan Jin;Zhengjian Zhang;Jinhu Bian;Gaofei Yin	2017	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2017.2649522	water content;hydrology;evaluation;soil science;earth;physics;satellite;remote sensing	Visualization	85.18273415800007	-60.53735790622511	106974

615394b9c7e6a82c0c26fde2a751fa63a252080c	millimeter wave high resolution radar accuracy in fog conditions—theory and experimental verification	fmcw radar;tera-hertz frequencies;atmosphere;extremely high frequencies;millimeter waves	Attenuation and group delay effects on millimeter wave (MMW) propagation in clouds and fog are studied theoretically and verified experimentally using high resolution radar in an indoor space filled with artificial fog. In the theoretical analysis, the frequency-dependent attenuation and group delay were derived via the permittivity of the medium. The results are applied to modify the millimeter-wave propagation model (MPM) and employed to study the effect of fog and cloud on the accuracy of the Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) radar operating in millimeter wavelengths. Artificial fog was generated in the experimental study to demonstrate ultra-low visibility in a confined space. The resulted attenuation and group delay were measured using FMCW radar operating at 320⁻330 GHz. It was found that apart from the attenuation, the incremental group delay caused by the fog also played a role in the accuracy of the radar. The results were compared to the analytical model. It was shown that although the artificial fog has slight different characteristics compare to the natural fog and clouds, in particle composition, size, and density, the model predictions were good, pointing out that the dispersive effects should be considered in the design of remote sensing radars operating in millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelengths.	conceptualization (information science);confined spaces;data curation;digital curation;dimensions;dispersive partial differential equation;experiment;fill;group delay and phase delay;high-resolution scheme;image resolution;increment;material point method;modulation;numerical weather prediction;radar;radio-frequency sweep;rayleigh–ritz method;software propagation;suspensions;verification of theories;millimeter;wavelength	Yosef Golovachev;Ariel Etinger;Gad A.

The dielectric constant of frozen soil is relatively lower than that of unfrozen soil, so that microwave could penetrate deeper into frozen soil. However, we are still lack of the knowledge of the Microwave Penetration Depth (MPD) of frozen soil. In this study, a noncoherent microwave radiation was used to find the factors that influence the MPD of frozen soil and then validated by experiments. The results showed that the frequency of microwave, the temperature of frozen soil and the soil texture are the main factors that determine the MPD of frozen soil. An empirical model that estimates the MPD of frozen soil was proposed based on the simulation data.	experiment;microwave;simulation	Shaojie Zhao;Lixin Zhang;Tao Zhang;Zhenguo Hao;Linna Chai;Zhongjun Zhang	2012	2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6350473	hydrology;soil science;texture;physics;permittivity;remote sensing	Embedded	84.5757717306303	-64.54890431157695	107483

The study area was the Pampean Region of Argentina, which was selected because it is a vast area of flatlands containing quite homogeneous rain-fed croplands, which are considered SMOS nominal land uses and hardly affected by radio-frequency interference contamination. Transects of ground handheld SM measurements were performed using ThetaProbe ML2x probes within four Icosahedral Snyder Equal Area Earth (ISEA) grid nodes, where permanent SM stations are located. The campaign results showed a negative bias of -0.02 m3m-3 between concurrent SMOS data and ground SM measurements, which means a slight SMOS underestimation, and a standard deviation of ±0.06 m3m-3. Additionally, a good correlation was obtained between the handheld SM measurements taken during the campaign and the permanent SM station data within a node, which pointed out that the station data could be used as reference data to evaluate the SMOS product over a longer temporal period. SMOS-retrieved data were also compared with station mean SM values from 2012 to 2014. A general SMOS underestimation of -0.05 m3m-3 was observed, with a standard deviation of ±0.04 m3m-3, which yields an uncertainty of ±0.07 m3m-3 for the SMOS product. Although the random error meets the SMOS mission's goal of ±0.04 m3m-3, the product overall uncertainty is higher than that due to the significant dry bias, which is also found in other regions of the world.	algorithm;geodesic grid;gradient;handheld game console;interference (communication);microwave imaging radiometer with aperture synthesis;physical review a;radio frequency;spatial variability;spin contamination;topography	Raquel Niclos;Raul Rivas;Vicente García-Santos;Carolina Dona;Enric Valor;Mauro E.

8b101587c1ec5da290786e3d3587c8bf0f0b8162	assessment of three tropospheric delay models (iggtrop, egnos and unb3m) based on precise point positioning in the chinese region	egnos model;iggtrop model;unb3m model;zenith tropospheric delay;precise point positioning	Tropospheric delays are one of the main sources of errors in the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). They are usually corrected by using tropospheric delay models, which makes the accuracy of the models rather critical for accurate positioning. To provide references for suitable models to be chosen for GNSS users in China, we conduct herein a comprehensive study of the performances of the IGGtrop, EGNOS and UNB3m models in China. Firstly, we assess the models using 5 years' Global Positioning System (GPS) derived Zenith Tropospheric Delay (ZTD) series from 25 stations of the Crustal Movement Observation Network of China (CMONOC). Then we study the effects of the models on satellite positioning by using various Precise Point Positioning (PPP) cases with different tropospheric delay resolutions, the observation data processed in PPP is from 21 base stations of CMONOC for a whole year of 2012. The results show that: (1) the Root Mean Square (RMS) of the IGGtrop model is about 4.4 cm, which improves the accuracy of ZTD estimations by about 24% for EGNOS and 19% for UNB3m; (2) The positioning error in the vertical component of the PPP solution obtained by using the IGGtrop model is about 15.0 cm, which is about 30% and 21% smaller than those of the EGNOS and UNB3m models, respectively. In summary, the IGGtrop model achieves the best performance among the three models in the Chinese region.	european geostationary navigation overlay service;galileo (satellite navigation);global positioning system;large;performance;precise point positioning;root mean square;satellite navigation;small;solutions;speech delay	Hong-Xing Zhang;Yunbin Yuan;Wei Li;Ying Li;Yanju Chai	2016		10.3390/s16010122	meteorology;precise point positioning;physics;remote sensing	Mobile	83.63085859883745	-61.89496480533128	108264

Specifically, we refer to the attempts and successes to model the percent vegetation cover (2-dimensional horizontal density) within a pixel, known as fractional coverage (fc). With this paper, we present a hybrid visual estimation method for fc field data collection in the complex landscapes found in humid tropical environments. The method includes a scalable theoretical model of fc, integrates the visual estimation technique with hemispherical photography collection, and is conducted over a systematic ground collection area. We present results from a case study conducted in the humid tropical region of Ecuador. Specifically, we report on the relationship between fc data modeled using a linear NDVI transformation and observed fc data collected using our hybrid visual estimation method. Our study found a significant, positive linear relationship ( ̌ = 0.795, r2 > 0.84, and p < 0.001) between modeled and observed fc values. Because the accuracy of both modeled and observed values are unknown, a full validation of the proposed method of collection is not possible. Therefore, we conduct an error assessment, identifying limitations in the modeling method (e.g., non-linear relationship between modeled and true values and potential for saturation) and hybrid ground-truth collection method (e.g., subjectivity of visual estimation and positional errors in the ground collection area) that explain the deviation from a 1:1 relationship. We believe the proposed method of ground truth data collection is a significant contribution towards efforts to validate biophysical information gained from remotely sensed	1:1 pixel mapping;coverage data;ground truth;nonlinear system;scalability;stellar classification;theory	Paul L.

Both two- and three-frequency approaches were examined and tested in detail for the inversion technique. Initially the technique was tested with a simulated data set generated from various scattering models. Later it was applied to an experimental data set that provided, for a wide range of surface roughness and soil moisture, backscattering coefficients at many incidence angles and frequencies. It was found that, in general, the three-frequency approach produces more accurate results. However, under a favorable combination of frequencies and incidence angles, both approaches give results with a comparable accuracy. There is a potential that soil moisture could be estimated to an accuracy of about 2%. In the mean time the surface roughness parameters could be estimated to an accuracy of better than 10%. >	coefficient;jaccard index	K. S. Rao;Suresh Raju;James R. Wang	1993	IEEE Trans.

54100bd48a7fc98125a2dcfdd2a7afbe2cfbfa8d	measuring landscape albedo using unmanned aerial vehicles		Surface albedo is a critical parameter in surface energy balance, and albedo change is an important driver of changes in local climate. In this study, we developed a workflow for landscape albedo estimation using images acquired with a consumer-grade camera on board unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Flight experiments were conducted at two sites in Connecticut, USA and the UAV-derived albedo was compared with the albedo obtained from a Landsat image acquired at about the same time as the UAV experiments. We find that the UAV estimate of the visibleband albedo of an urban playground (0.037 ± 0.063, mean ± standard deviation of pixel values) under clear sky conditions agrees reasonably well with the estimates based on the Landsat image (0.047 ± 0.012). However, because the cameras could only measure reflectance in three visible bands (blue, green, and red), the agreement is poor for shortwave albedo. We suggest that the deployment of a camera that is capable of detecting reflectance at a near-infrared waveband should improve the accuracy of the shortwave albedo estimation.	aerial photography;bands;deploy;drug vehicle;estimated;experiment;frequency band;pixel;population parameter;sensor;standard deviation;unmanned aerial vehicle;energy balance	Chang Cao;X.

Therefore, it is great significant to master coastline change for shore and mudflats exploitation and utilization, environmental protection and Marine disaster assessment. This paper mainly focuses on the following three issues: adopting the high-resolution satellite images to mine spatial data of images and interpret the coastline in different periods; Obtaining coastline information quantitatively and calculating the pattern and speed variation of progradation or erosion of the coastline by choosing 12 cross-sections along Yancheng's coastal area; Analyzing the impact of human activities on coastline change in typical coast area. Results show that the coastline is straightening intensely influenced by mankind activities. Nearly 40km of the length of the coastline is cut down between 2007 and 2009, which is rather serious but slowed down in 2009 and 2010. Also, Annual average prograding rate of Yancheng's coastline is between 44m and 100m. The prograding variation has little change in the north of the Sheyang estuary, but great change in the south. Especially, the prograding rate reached 278m per year from Shuilong port to Chuandong port.	coastline paradox;cross section (geometry);erosion (morphology);image resolution	Jing Li	2011	Proceedings 2011 IEEE International Conference on Spatial Data Mining and Geographical Knowledge Services	10.1109/ICSDM.2011.5969109	erosion;cross section;spatial analysis;remote sensing	Robotics	83.03197208478902	-56.600544850125196	109267
64c84769240d1ceda0174fad91172936cb0400d5	incorporation of satellite data and uncertainty in a nationwide groundwater recharge model in new zealand		A nationwide model of groundwater recharge for New Zealand (NGRM), as described in this paper, demonstrated the benefits of satellite data and global models to improve the spatial definition of recharge and the estimation of recharge uncertainty. NGRM was inspired by the global-scale WaterGAP model but with the key development of rainfall recharge calculation on scales relevant to nationaland catchment-scale studies (i.e., a 1 km × 1 km cell size and a monthly timestep in the period 2000–2014) provided by satellite data (i.e., MODIS-derived evapotranspiration, AET and vegetation) in combination with national datasets of rainfall, elevation, soil and geology. The resulting nationwide model calculates groundwater recharge estimates, including their uncertainty, consistent across the country, which makes the model unique compared to all other New Zealand estimates targeted towards groundwater recharge. At the national scale, NGRM estimated an average recharge of 2500 m3/s, or 298 mm/year, with a model uncertainty of 17%. Those results were similar to the WaterGAP model, but the improved input data resulted in better spatial characteristics of recharge estimates. Multiple uncertainty analyses led to these main conclusions: the NGRM model could give valuable initial estimates in data-sparse areas, since it compared well to most ground-observed lysimeter data and local recharge models; and the nationwide input data of rainfall and geology caused the largest uncertainty in the model equation, which revealed that the satellite data could improve spatial characteristics without significantly increasing the uncertainty. Clearly the increasing volume and availability of large-scale satellite data is creating more opportunities for the application of national-scale models at the catchment, and smaller, scales. This should result in improved utility of these models including provision of initial estimates in data-sparse areas. Topics for future collaborative research associated with the NGRM model include: improvement of rainfall-runoff models, establishment of snowmelt and river recharge modules, further improvement of estimates of rainfall and AET, and satellite-derived AET in irrigated areas. Importantly, the quantification of uncertainty, which should be associated with all future models, should give further impetus to field measurements of rainfall recharge for the purpose of model calibration.	rechargeable battery;sparse matrix;typset and runoff	Rogier Westerhoff;Paul A.

4e7882fb4039505fabaa7141d9a5fba6bb429d68	uncertainty of soil reflectance retrieval from spot and rapideye multispectral satellite images using a per-pixel bootstrapped empirical line atmospheric correction over an agricultural region	atmospheric correction accuracy;spot;rapideye;per pixel empirical line;soil reflectance;atcor2	Many authors have reported the use of empirical line regression between field target sites and image pixels in order to perform atmospheric correction of multispectral images. However few studies were dedicated to the specific reflectance retrieval for cultivated bare soils from multispectral satellite images, from a large number (≥15) of bare field targets spread over a region. Even fewer were oriented towards additional field targets for validation and uncertainty assessment of reflectance error. This study aimed at assessing ELM validation accuracy and uncertainty for predicting topsoil reflectance over a wide area (221 km2) with contrasting soils and tillage practices using a set of six multispectral images at very high (supermode SPOT5, 2.5 m), high (RapidEye, 6.5 m) and medium (SPOT4, 20 m) spatial resolutions. For each image and each spectral band, linear regression (LR) models were constructed through a series of 1000 bootstrap datasets of training/validation samples generated amongst a total of about 30 field sites used as targets, the reflectance measurements of which were made between −6 days/+7 days around acquisition date. The achieved models had an average coefficient of variation of validation errors of ∼14%, which indicates that the composition of training field sites does influence performance results of ELM. However, according to median LR-models, our approach mostly resulted in accurate predictions with low standard errors of estimation around 1–2% reflectance, validation errors of 2–3% reflectance, low validation bias (<|1|% reflectance). The best results were obtained for SPOT5 and RapidEye images the spatial resolution of which is likely to better match the size of the sampled field sites. The worst results (higher median RMSE values 3.1–4.8%) were yielded for shortwave-infrared bands of SPOT4 images acquired in March: in agricultural areas, images programmed during periods when most field tillage operations have resulted in smooth seedbed conditions (April in this study) are in favour of better performances of soil reflectance prediction. Nevertheless, directional effects appear to mainly and moderately affect the global performance of near-infrared and SWIR bands-models except for oblique viewing images (viewing angle > |20◦|). The predictions obtained from median LR-models through per-pixel bootstrapped ELM approach were as accurate as the ATCOR2 predictions with default parameters for the RapidEye image ccura and were slightly more a	coefficient;elm;lr parser;mathematical model;multispectral image;oblique projection;performance;pixel;viewing angle	Emmanuelle Vaudour;Jean-Marc Gilliot;L.

These two techniques are 1) the split-window covariance-variance ratio (SWCVR), based on a quadratic relationship betweenW and the ratio of the spatial covariance and variance of brightness temperatures measured in channels 4 ( T 4) and 5 (T 5) of AVHRR in subsets ofN neighboring pixels and 2) the linear split-window relationship (LSWR), based on a linear regression betweenW and the difference of brightness temperatures measured in the same channels ( T=T 4 T 5). The results demonstrate the advantage of the SWCVR technique for regions with a certain level of thermal heterogeneity (standard deviation ofT 4 in the subset>0.5 K), which is capable of estimatingW from NOAA-14 afternoon and night passes over the Iberian Peninsula with a standard deviation of 0.5 (g cm 2), whereas the LSWR technique predicts the atmospheric water vapor with a standard deviation from 1.3–1.5 (g cm ). Finally a water vapor image of the entire Iberian Peninsula constructed by applying the SWCVR to NOAA-14 data is presented.	image resolution;modtran;pixel	José A.

8fbca24040572d8e09882a70782ef289d53efce7	identifying categorical land use transition and land degradation in northwestern drylands of ethiopia	net change;degradation;swap change;ndvi;support vector machine svm;systematic transition;dryland	Land use transition in dryland ecosystems is one of the major driving forces to landscape change that directly impacts the welfare of humans. In this study, the support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithm and cross tabulation matrix analysis are used to identify systematic and random processes of change. The magnitude and prevailing signals of land use transitions are assessed taking into account net change and swap change. Moreover, spatiotemporal patterns and the relationship of precipitation and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) are explored to evaluate landscape degradation. The assessment showed that 44% of net change and about 54% of total change occurred during the study period, with the latter being due to swap change. The conversion of over 39% of woodland to cropland accounts for the existence of the highest loss of valuable ecosystem of the region. The spatial relationship of NDVI and precipitation also showed R2 of below 0.5 over 55% of the landscape with no significant changes in the precipitation trend, thus representing an indicative symptom of land degradation. This in-depth analysis of random and systematic landscape change is crucial for designing policy intervention to halt woodland degradation in this fragile environment.	algorithm;aquatic ecosystem;contingency table;elegant degradation;halting problem;matrix analysis;paging;quantum gate;sensor;spatiotemporal pattern;stochastic matrix;stochastic process;support vector machine;table (information)	Worku Zewdie;Elmar Csaplovics	2016	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs8050408	degradation;normalized difference vegetation index;hydrology;ecology	ML	83.6584099194995	-56.05921694771099	110107

Here, we objectively evaluate this potential using data sets generated by both the ESA SMOS and NASA SMAP satellite missions. Evaluation is based on their ability to improve the representation of both 1) pre-storm antecedent soil moisture conditions and 2) within-storm rainfall accumulation depths. Results demonstrate that SMOS and SMAP surface soil moisture products can significantly improve both key aspects of a hydrologic prediction system.	esa;l band;tree accumulation	Wade T.

Optimizing the use of inputs by applying exact and accurate doses, which match the real needs of the soil, in addition to supplying the necessary nutrients for the correct development of the crops, enables a reduction in costs and environmental impacts caused by the incorrect use of products such as fertilizers and pesticides. With this background, this paper presents a study on the development of a capacitive sensor to identify the absence, presence or variations in the distribution of solid mineral fertilizers. To evaluate this sensor, eight different formulations were tested in distribution analysis with an overflow dosing mechanism, both statically and dynamically, with 2% maximum moisture variation between all samples. The identification of an absence or presence of fertilizers was successful in 100% of the experiments. Tests to identify variations in the fertilizer distribution were carried out through simulated obstruction. The sensor identified a reduction in the fertilizer flow in all experiments, obtaining numeric variations above 55%. In the fertilizer formulation identification test, only the formulations 02-28-20 and 06-21-12 in experiments carried out with the overflow dosing mechanism did not differ statistically one from another, while all other formulations presented a statistically significant difference in the ANOVA analysis and the Tukey test at 5% significance.

532606b722fcd7f86ca2e82a47a5e279c2f55f2f	assessment of modis brdf/albedo model parameters (mcd43a1 collection 6) for directional reflectance retrieval		Measurements of solar radiation reflected from Earth’s surface are the basis for calculating albedo, vegetation indices, and other terrestrial attributes. However, the “bi-directional” geometry of illumination and viewing (i.e., the Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)) impacts reflectance and all variables derived or estimated based on these data. The recently released MODIS BRDF/Albedo Model Parameters (MCD43A1 Collection 6) dataset enables retrieval of directional reflectance at arbitrary solar and viewing angles, potentially increasing precision and comparability of data collected under different illumination and observation geometries. We quantified the ability of MCD43A1 Collection 6 for retrieving directional reflectance and compared the daily Collection 6 retrievals to those of MCD43A1 Collection 5, which are retrieved on an eight-day basis. Correcting MODIS-based estimates of surface reflectance from the illumination and viewing geometry of the Terra satellite (MOD09GA) to that of the MODIS Aqua (MYD09GA) overpass, as well as MCD43A4 Collection 6 and Landsat-5 TM images show that the BRDF correction of MCD43A1 Collection 6 results in greater consistency among datasets, with higher R2 (0.63–0.955), regression slopes closer to unity (0.718–0.955), lower root mean squared difference (RMSD) (0.422–3.142), and lower mean absolute error (MAE) (0.282–1.735) compared to the Collection 5 data. Smaller levels of noise (observed as high-frequency variability within the time series) in MCD43A1 Collection 6 in comparison to Collection 5 corroborates the improvement of BRDF parameters time series. These results corroborates that the daily MCD43A1 Collection 6 product represents the anisotropy of surface features and results in more precise directional reflectance derivation at any solar and viewing geometry than did the previous Collection 5.	bidirectional reflectance distribution function	Xianghong Che;Min Feng;Joseph O.

The parametric approach involves comparison of established and generic narrowband vegetation indices (VIs) and the Normalized Area Over reflectance Curve method, which calculates the continuum spectral region sensitive to Chl. However, as not all available bands take part in these spectral algorithms, it remains unclear whether optimal estimations are achieved. Alternatively, the nonparametric approach is based on Gaussian process (GP) techniques and allows inclusion of all bands. GP builds a nonlinear regression as a linear combination of spectra mapped to a high-dimensional space. Moreover, GP provides an indication of the most contributing bands for each parameter, a weight for the most relevant spectra contained in the training data set, and a confidence estimate of the retrieval. GP has previously demonstrated to be competitive in accuracy with support vector regression and neural networks. Results from hyperspectral Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer data over the Spanish Barrax test site show that GP outperformed the VIs in assessing the vegetation properties when using at least four out of the 62 bands. GP identified most contributing bands in the red and red edge and, to a lower extent, in the blue and NIR parts of the spectrum. Since the proposed GP method is able to build robust relationships between the parameter of interest and only a few bands, it is a promising approach for multispectral data as well.	approximation algorithm;artificial neural network;black box;data cube;gaussian process;motorola canopy;multispectral image;nonlinear system;relevance;sensor;software portability;support vector machine;test set;triune continuum paradigm;usability	Jochem Verrelst;Luis Alonso;Gustavo Camps-Valls;Jesús Delegido;José F.

New high resolution LAI satellite data is now available covering a period of several decades. OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2013, 5 4820 This provides a unique opportunity to validate LAI estimates from multiple vegetation models. The objective of this paper is to compare new, satellite-derived LAI measurements with modeled output for the Northern Hemisphere. We compare monthly LAI output from eight land surface models from the TRENDY compendium with satellite data from an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) from the latest version (third generation) of GIMMS AVHRR NDVI data over the period 1986–2005. Our results show that all the models overestimate the mean LAI, particularly over the boreal forest. We also find that seven out of the eight models overestimate the length of the active vegetation-growing season, mostly due to a late dormancy as a result of a late summer phenology. Finally, we find that the models report a much larger positive trend in LAI over this period than the satellite observations suggest, which translates into a higher trend in the growing season length. These results highlight the need to incorporate a larger number of more accurate plant functional types in all models and, in particular, to improve the phenology of deciduous trees.	artificial neural network;climate model;compendium;graph partition;image resolution;onset (audio);simulation;test case	Guillermo Murray-Tortarolo;Alessandro Anav;Pierre Friedlingstein;Stephen Sitch;Shilong Piao;Zaichun Zhu;Benjamin Poulter;Sönke Zaehle;Anders Ahlström;Mark Lomas;Sam Levis;Nicolas Viovy;Ning Zeng	2013	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs5104819	meteorology;growing season;phenology;climatology;remote sensing	ML	84.19849772852943	-58.778035356818386	111571

The annual mean values of ADRE for the region are +0.55±0.1W/m2 for black carbon (BC); −1.23±0.39W/m2 for organic carbon (OC); −3.81±0.71W/m2 for sulphate (SU); −3.16±0.45W/m2 for dust (DU); −0.64±0.55W/m2 for sea salt (SS); −3.98±0.57W/m2 for anthropogenic aerosol (AN); −4.37±1.11 W/m2 for natural aerosol (NA); and −8.37±1.69W/m2 for total aerosols (TOT). Both anthropogenic and natural aerosol direct radiative effects in the region are much higher than their global counterparts. Validations have also been performed by comparing our component ADRE computation with the radiative transfer calculations for the AERONET sites and the ACE-Asia field campaign.		Tom X.-P.

In this paper, the multiple scattering effect between heterogeneous non-isothermal surfaces is described rigorously according to the concept of configuration factor, based on which a directional thermal radiance model is built, and the directional radiant character for urban canopy is analyzed. The model is applied to a simple urban canopy with row structure to simulate the change of Directional Brightness Temperature (DBT). The results show that the DBT is aggrandized because of the multiple scattering effects, whereas the change range of DBT is smoothed. The temperature difference, spatial distribution, emissivity of the components can all lead to the change of DBT. The “hot spot” phenomenon occurs when the proportion of high temperature component in the vision field came to a head. On the other hand, the “cool spot” phenomena occur when low temperature proportion came to the head. The “spot” effect disappears only when the proportion of every component keeps invariability. The model built in this paper can be used for the study of directional effect on emissivity, the LST retrieval over urban areas and the adjacency effect of thermal remote sensing pixels.	hotspot (wi-fi);motorola canopy;pixel;radiant ai;simulation;smoothing	Limin Zhao;Xingfa Gu;Tao Yu;Wei Wan;Jiaguo Li	2012	2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6350769	meteorology;atmospheric temperature;geology;emissivity;optics;physics;remote sensing	Robotics	87.20464833638195	-60.86085624604361	112509

We compared the spatial, monthly and annual variation over Jing-Jin-Tang district and analyzed the main factors of these changes. Our study indicates that there is a decreasing trend in the annual variation of AOT since 2004.

2ca80daed51d26c093ac5da75c5362444b3d9bd2	the temporal-spatial characteristics of drought in the loess plateau using the remote-sensed trmm precipitation data from 1998 to 2014		Rainfall gauges are always sparse in the arid and semi-arid areas of Northwest China, which makes it difficult to precisely study the characteristics of drought at a large scale in this region and similar areas. This study used the TRMM (The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) multi-satellite precipitation data to study the spatial-temporal evolution of drought in the Loess Plateau based on the SPI (Standardized Precipitation Index) drought index for the period of 1998–2014. The results indicate that the monthly TRMM precipitation data are well matched with the observed precipitation, indicating that this remotely sensed data set can be reliably used to calculate the SPI drought index. Based on the study findings, the average precipitation in the Loess Plateau is showing a significant increasing trend at the rate of 4.46 mm/year. From the spatial perspective, the average annual precipitation in the Southeast is generally greater than that in the Northwest. However, the annual precipitation in the Southeast area is showing a decreasing trend, whereas, the annual precipitation in the northwest areas is showing an increasing trend. Through the SPI analysis, the 3-month SPI and 12-month SPI were both showing an increasing trend, which indicates that the drought severity in the Loess Plateau was a generally declining trend at a seasonal to annual time scale. From the spatial perspective, the SPI values in the Central and Northwest of the Loess Plateau were significantly increasing, whereas, the SPI values in the southern area of the Loess Plateau were slightly decreasing. From the seasonal characteristics, the high-risk area for drought in the spring was concentrated in the northeast and southwest part, and in the summer and autumn, the high-risk area was transferred to the south part. Through this study, it is concluded that the Loess Plateau was likely getting wetter during the time period since the Grain-for-Green Project (1999–2012) was implemented, which replaced much farmland with forestry. This is a positive signal for vegetation recovery and ecological restoration in the near future.	arid;academy;coefficient;experiment;open research;optical mesh network;semiconductor industry;simulation;sparse matrix	Qi Zhao;Qianyun Chen;Mengyan Jiao;Pute Wu;Xuerui Gao;Meihong Ma;Yang Hong	2018	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs10060838	remote sensing;climatology;restoration ecology;loess;vegetation;geology;arid;precipitation;plateau	Arch	83.41485401471178	-56.909380760185314	113751

LC is the observed biophysical cover on the surface of the Earth and describes how much of a region is covered by forests, wetlands, impervious surfaces, etc. LC information can be extracted by processing remotely sensed data acquired through sensors mounted either on space borne satellites or aircrafts. Since these data are a mixture of more than two LC class types, unmixing algorithms based on linear mixture model such as simplex projection, aims to resolve the different components of mixed pixels in the data. This method is based on the equivalence of the fully constrained least squares problem of projecting a point onto a simplex. The algorithm does not perform optimization and is analytical, thus reducing the computational complexity. The algorithm is tested on computer-simulated data of various signal to noise ratio and Landsat-5 TM data of an agricultural landscape and an urban scenario. The results are validated using descriptive statistics, correlation coefficient, root mean square error, probability of success and bivariate distribution function.	algorithm;bivariate data;coefficient;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;data mining;information extraction;linear least squares (mathematics);lithosphere;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;mixture model;ordinary least squares;pixel;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;time complexity;turing completeness;xml:tm	Uttam Kumar;Cristina Milesi;Sangram Ganguly;S.

However, it is in tropical countries where scientists can have the most limited access to analytical tools needed for research on these processes. This paper describes the construction and test of a less than U$ 50 chamber for monitoring of multiple soil gas emissions. The system consisted on an array of three MQ series gas sensors placed into an airtight container, a PIC microcontroller and a custom-built software developed for data capture and visualization running on a laptop. A modified multiplexing of sensors was also incorporated in order to allow the parallel analysis in up to eight samples. The chamber, hereafter called SENose (short for Soil Electric Nose), was tested in two separate experiments. The first study used the three sensor array system in soil samples from Colombia and Ecuador, which were separated into two groups in order to study their gas emission patterns in D(+) glucose induced respiration tests. For a second experiment using a multiplexed sensor array in a different set of Colombian soil samples, gas emission patterns were obtained from autoclaved soil with reduced microbial activity, which were further contaminated with diesel oil as C source. During the first study, in replicated 22 h continuous runs SENose clearly showed differences in soil respiration patterns of these soil samples, and a prominent timing differential increase in gas production after spiking D(+) glucose, a proxy for organic C, as a substrate. Results of the second study showed a clearly different pattern of gas emissions in diesel oil contaminated samples, when microbial activity was reduced by soil autoclaving. Moreover, two groups of non-autoclaved soil subsamples differing only in diesel oil addition could also be differentiated with basis on their respiration patterns after some hours of gas tracking. Based on these results we foresee a great potential from the use of this low cost system in fields such as soil microbiology, fertility, biotechnology and environmental sciences, where processes such as microbial activity, plant nutrient availability or soil pollutant turnover are tracked by monitoring their gas emission patterns. 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, the effect of a record-breaking heavy rain even on long-term statistics is discussed.

Many ecoinformatic tools, including artificial neural networks (ANNs), can shed important insights into the complexities of ecological data through pattern recognition and prediction; however, we argue that ecological knowledge has been used in a very limited fashion to shape the manner in which these approaches are applied. The present study provides a simple example of using ecological theory to better direct the use of neural networks to address a fundamental question in aquatic ecology—how are local stream macroinvertebrate communities structured by a hierarchy of environmental factors operating at multiple spatial scales? Using data for 195 sites in the western United States, we developed single-scale, multi-scale and hierarchical multiscale neural networks relating EPT (Orders: Ephermeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera) richness to environmental variables quantified at 3 spatial scales: entire watershed, valley bottom (100s–1000s m), and local stream reach (10s–100s m). Results showed that models based on multiple spatial scales greatly outperformed single-scale analyses (R=0.74 vs. R̄=0.51) and that a hierarchical ANN, which accounts for the fact that valleyand watershed-scale drivers influence local characteristics of the stream reach, provided greater insight into how environmental factors interact across nested spatial scales than did the non-hierarchical multi-scale model. Our analysis suggests that watershed drivers play a greater role in structuring local macroinvertebrate assemblages via their direct effects on local-scale habitats, whereas they play a much smaller indirect role through their influence on valley-scale characteristics. For the hierarchical model, the strongest predictors of EPT richness included descriptors of climate, land-use and hydrology at the watershed scale, land-use at the valley scale, and substrate characteristics and riparian cover at the reach scale. In summary, our results highlight the importance of incorporating environmental hierarchies to better understand and predict local patterns of macroinvertebrate assemblage structure in stream ecosystems. More generally, our case study serves to emphasize how incorporating prior ecological knowledge into ANN model structure can strengthen the relevance of ecoinformatic techniques for the broader scientific community. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

aba2035ede866b244e4a85073abbfdbee0ec385a	regional daily et estimates based on the gap-filling method of surface conductance		Remote sensing allows regional evapotranspiration (ET) values to be obtained. Surface conductance is a key variable in estimating ET and controls surface flux interactions between the underlying surface and atmosphere. Limited by the influence of clouds, ET can only be estimated on cloud-free days. In this study, a gap-filling method is proposed to acquire daily surface conductance, which was coupled into a Penman-Monteith (P-M) equation, to estimate the regional daily ET over the Hai River Basin. The gap-filling method is coupled with the canopy conductance, surface conductance and a simple time extension method, which provides more mechanisms and is more comprehensive. Field observations, including eddy covariance (EC) fluxes and meteorological elements from automatic weather station (AWS), were collected from two sites for calibration and validation. One site is located in Guantao County, which is cropped in a circular pattern with winter wheat and summer maize. The other site is located in Miyun County, which has orchard and summer maize crops. The P-M equation was inverted to the computed surface conductance at the field scale, and latent heat fluxes from EC were processed and converted to daily ET. The results show that the surface conductance model used in the gap-filling method performs well compared with the inverted surface conductance, which suggests that the model used here is reasonable. In addition, the relationship between the results estimated from the gap-filling method and EC measurements is more pronounced than that between the other method and the EC measurements. The R2 values improve from 0.68 to 0.75 at the Guantao site and from 0.79 to 0.88 at the Miyun site. The improvement mainly occurs during the growing crop season, according to the temporal variations in the results.	amazon web services;computer performance;conductance (graph);extension method;interaction;large eddy simulation;motorola canopy;multi-source;orchard	Jiaming Xu;Bingfang Wu;Nana Yan;Shen Tan	2018	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs10040554	conductance;remote sensing;evapotranspiration;flux;eddy covariance;canopy conductance;climatology;latent heat;automatic weather station;geology;drainage basin	HCI	86.27144026747659	-58.80445345906982	115637
817191a714aeb14fdd7897de544e988638d48661	analysis of modis satellite thermal infrared information before and after ms 6.5 ludian earthquake		Continuous MODIS/Terra satellite remote sensing thermal infrared data of the 6.5-magnitude earthquake region in Ludian, Yunnan, from June to August 2014 were collected. Through cloud removing and other data treatments, the infrared data obtained during the optimal observation period from 5:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. of Beijing time were chosen for surface temperature retrieval. The relationship between the time-based evolution of anomalous surface temperature and anomalous space distribution, and the active fault before and after the earthquake was analyzed; the time and space relevance between the anomalous surface temperature and the latent heat flux changes was studied; and the influence of non-structural factors, such as landform and seasonal climate, on the anomalous surface is studied. Results suggested that: (1) one month before the occurrence of Ludian Earthquake, the epicenter showed anomalously increasing temperature of the thermal infrared, meaning that the anomalous temperature increase was related to the earthquake occurrence time; the significant temperature increase lasted for half a month before the earthquake, and the anomalous temperature increase reached the peak five to six days before the earthquake, but it decreased dramatically after the earthquake; (2) based on the hyperspectral data and the geological observation meteorological data, the influence of clouds and vegetation cover in the earthquake area was removed. The latent heat flux changes inverted showed a close time and space relevance with the anomalous surface temperature increase; (3) the analysis of the relevance with the landform and the seasonal climate factors suggested that there was structural “temperature increase” information of out-of-season changes before the earthquake; (4) the anomalous temperature increase developed in the shape of “X” from the epicenter to the conjugate fault. This coincided with the mechanical effect generated by the “L-shaped” asymmetric conjugated fault extended in the NW-SE direction of the advantageous distribution of the horizontal maximum principal stress and the NW~EW direction after the earthquake. Considering the influence of landform, seasonal climate and other non-structural factors on anomalous temperature increase, the author thought that the temperature increase of the thermal infrared might be a short-term anomalous phenomenon before the earthquake.

There are two problems in order to deploy the BSNET: the number of the light traps and their positions. In this paper, we propose a new approach to optimize the BSNET by determining the number of light traps needed and the position for every light trap node in the surveillance region based on HoneyComb architecture. The experiment results are performed on the Brown Planthoppers surveillance network for Mekong Delta in Viet Nam.	optimizing compiler	Huong Hoang Luong;Tuyen Phong Truong;Ky Minh Nguyen;Bao Hoai Lam;Hiep Xuan Huynh	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-46909-6_16	telecommunications;computer security;cartography	Vision	83.23443351668573	-53.69355520065062	115792

Control simulations forced by the present day, fixed atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration are conducted using two horizontal resolutions and validated against observations and reanalyses. The mean state simulated by the higher resolution configuration has smaller biases. Climate variability also shows some sensitivity to resolution but not as uniform as in the case of mean state. The interannual and seasonal variability are better represented in the simulation at lower resolution whereas the subseasonal variability is more accurate in the higher resolution simulation. The equilibrium climate sensitivity of the model is estimated from a simulation forced by an abrupt quadrupling of the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. The equilibrium climate sensitivity temperature of the model is 2.77^oC, and this value is slightly smaller than the mean value (3.37^oC) of contemporary models using conventional representation of cloud processes. The climate change simulation forced by the representative concentration pathway 8.5 scenario projects an increase in the frequency of severe droughts over most of the North America.	climate model;simulation	Cristiana Stan;Li Xu	2014	Environmental Modelling and Software	10.1016/j.envsoft.2014.06.013	general circulation model;meteorology;transient climate simulation;atmospheric sciences;climatology;climate change;climate sensitivity	SE	86.74171085728548	-57.037927845293275	116560

Timely and accurate forecast of wheat yield and production at global scale is vital in implementing food security policy. Becker-Reshef et al. (2010) developed a generalized empirical model for forecasting winter wheat production using remote sensing data and official statistics. This model was implemented using static wheat maps. In this paper, we analyze the impact of incorporating yearly wheat masks into the forecasting model. We propose a new approach of producing in season winter wheat maps exploiting satellite data and official statistics on crop area only. Validation on independent data showed that the proposed approach reached 6% to 23% of omission error and 10% to 16% of commission error when mapping winter wheat 2-3 months before harvest. In general, we found a limited impact of using yearly winter wheat masks over a static mask for the study regions.	donald becker	Serhiy Skakun;Belen Franch;Jean-Claude Roger;Eric F.

Estimating above-ground biomass helps to monitor crop vitality and to predict yield. In this study, we estimated fresh and dry biomass on a summer barley test site with 18 cultivars and two nitrogen (N)-treatments using the plant height (PH) from crop surface models (CSMs). The superhigh resolution, multi-temporal (1 cm/pixel) CSMs were derived from red, green, blue (RGB) images captured from a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Comparison with PH reference measurements yielded an R of 0.92. The test site with different cultivars and treatments was monitored during “Biologische Bundesanstalt, Bundessortenamt und CHemische Industrie” (BBCH) Stages 24–89. A high correlation was found between PH from CSMs and fresh biomass (R = 0.81) and dry biomass (R = 0.82). Five models for above-ground fresh and dry biomass estimation were tested by cross-validation. Modelling biomass between different N-treatments for fresh biomass produced the best results (R = 0.71). The main limitation was the influence of lodging cultivars in the later growth stages, producing irregular plant heights. The method has potential for future application by non-professionals, i.e., farmers.

The integration of water quality models, in situ data and remote sensing data provide a new method to measure the content of chl-a, which can also provide spatial distribution information. This paper focused on developing and applying remote sensing algorithms to determine the chl-a content of such turbid, mesotrophic to highly eutrophic lake waters, using Lake Taihu, China as a case study. Landsat-5 TM data and synchronous in situ measurements were used. A Pearson correlation matrix indicated that the ratio of TM4 to TM3 has the strongest relationship with chl-a. A four-coefficient regression model using TM4/TM3 ratio and TM1, TM2 was a reliable predicator of chl-a (r2=0.837) for waters with chl-a concentration between 5 mgm-3 and 100 mgm-3.

The NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) is commonly used as an indicator in practical crop healthy monitoring. Hence, a spectroscopy-based device for indirectly measuring crop growth conditions in terms of NDVI is developed. This device consists of four channels: two are designed to measure the intensity of the sunlight and the other two are used to measure the reflected light from the crop canopy at the same time. An electronic control unit was designed to control the sensing and data recording processes, as well as to calculate the NDVI based on the sensed data. The measurable two wavelengths are 610 nm and 1220 nm. A series validation tests, comparing the measurement result against spectroradiometer readings, are conducted to evaluate the performance of the device. Leaf samples are collected to measure chlorophyll contents in laboratory. The correlation coefficient between the NDVI readings from the developed device and the chlorophyll content data measured by the UV-VIS Spectrophotometer reaches 0.81, which shows that the device can be used in practical crop management.	coefficient;electronic control unit;mobile device;motorola canopy;multispectral image	Di Cui;Minzan Li;Xiuhua Li	2008		10.1007/978-1-4419-0213-9_62	botany;crop coefficient;agronomy;horticulture	HCI	85.84468825654045	-53.28697059491298	116773

Because of the wave-length dependence of diffraction, the spectral channels do not sample the same volume of air, as in general assumed by retrieval algorithms for LEO IR (Infrared) sounder data. This additional error introduced in the retrieval by diffraction limited instruments is called 'pseudo noise' throughout the paper. One such diffraction-limited geostationary system is the candidate Infrared Sounding (IRS) mission on EUMETSAT Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) satellites with a planned need date in 2015, due to the expected lifetime of the current Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellites. A simplified Point Spread Function (PSF) is applied. To represent the channels within natural conditions, measured spectra from the low-earth orbit Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) at DeltaX = 15 km, as well as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) at DeltaX = 4 km are used as an underlying scene when integrating over the PSF. The results show that the pseudo noise is highly depending on wavelength, and highest in the window and CO2 regions (within the broader 700-1200 cm-1, or 8.3-14.3 mum, region). The worst case pseudo noise values are approximately 1 K for these regions. The broad-band AIRS results are confirmed by a direct comparison to MODIS data at 4 km resolution, where the worst case pseudo noise is appx. 0.5 K, while the best case pseudo noise is comparable to AIRS data.	algorithm;automatic sounding;best, worst and average case;geosynchronous satellite	Jochen Grandell;Rolf Stuhlmann	2007	2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423686	meteorology;infrared;point spread function;optical transfer function;optics;physics;remote sensing	Vision	83.15244547033285	-63.31988571589232	116888

Three scenario tests (diatom, nanoflagellate and dinoflagellate blooms) using the BN predicted diatom blooms to produce high chlorophyll a at the water surface while nanoflagellate blooms were predicted to occur also at lower depths (>5 m) in the water column and to produce lower chlorophyll a concentrations. A sensitivity analysis using all available data identified the variables with the greatest influence on POC accumulation being the enzymes, which highlights the importance of microbial community interactions. However, the incorporation of experimental and field data changed the sensitivity of the model nodes 25% in the BN and therefore, is an important consideration when combining manipulated data sets in data limited conditions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

260adb6d6bf129fdfd19d384af0a4e50b5865966	extraction of mangrove biophysical parameters using airborne lidar	crown diameter;crown overlap;tree density;mangrove;canopy height model;tree height;lidar	Tree parameter determinations using airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) have been conducted in many forest types, including coniferous, boreal, and deciduous. However, there are only a few scientific articles discussing the application of LiDAR to mangrove biophysical parameter extraction at an individual tree level. The main objective of this study was to investigate the potential of using LiDAR data to estimate the biophysical parameters of mangrove trees at an individual tree scale. The Variable Window Filtering (VWF) and Inverse Watershed Segmentation (IWS) methods were investigated by comparing their performance in individual tree detection and in deriving tree position, crown diameter, and tree height using the LiDAR-derived Canopy Height Model (CHM). The results demonstrated that each method performed well in mangrove forests with a low percentage of crown overlap conditions. The VWF method yielded a slightly higher accuracy for mangrove parameter extractions from LiDAR data compared with the IWS method. This is because the VWF method uses an adaptive circular filtering window size based on an allometric relationship. As a result of the VWF method, the position measurements of individual tree indicated a mean distance error value of 1.10 m. The OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2013, 5 1788 individual tree detection showed a kappa coefficient of agreement (K) value of 0.78. The estimation of crown diameter produced a coefficient of determination (R 2 ) value of 0.75, a Root Mean Square Error of the Estimate (RMSE) value of 1.65 m, and a Relative Error (RE) value of 19.7%. Tree height determination from LiDAR yielded an R 2 value of 0.80, an RMSE value of 1.42 m, and an RE value of 19.2%. However, there are some limitations in the mangrove parameters derived from LiDAR. The results indicated that an increase in the percentage of crown overlap (COL) results in an accuracy decrease of the mangrove parameters extracted from the LiDAR-derived CHM, particularly for crown measurements. In this study, the accuracy of LiDAR-derived biophysical parameters in mangrove forests using the VWF and IWS methods is lower than in coniferous, boreal, pine, and deciduous forests. An adaptive allometric equation that is specific for the level of tree density and percentage of crown overlap is a solution for improving the predictive accuracy of the VWF method.	airborne ranger;approximation error;chemdraw;coefficient of determination;col (game);crown group;kappa calculus;mean squared error;motorola canopy;scientific literature;tree (data structure);watershed (image processing)	Wasinee Wannasiri;Masahiko Nagai;Kiyoshi Honda;Phisan Santitamnont;Poonsak Miphokasap	2013	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs5041787	lidar;hydrology;mangrove;ecology;remote sensing	ML	85.59300804880208	-59.13157469448595	117607
03945a5640426eff1d1af0f360284b11cbd7e21d	improving tmpa 3b43 v7 data sets using land-surface characteristics and ground observations on the qinghai–tibet plateau		The accurate knowledge of precipitation information over the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau, where the rain gauge networks are limited, is vital for various applications. While satellite-based precipitation estimates provide high spatial resolution (0.25°), large uncertainties and systematic anomalies still exist over this critical area. To derive more accurate monthly precipitation estimates, a spatial data-mining algorithm was used to remove the obvious anomalies compared with their neighbors from the original Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) multisatellite precipitation analysis (TMPA) 3B43 V7 data at an annual scale, as the TMPA data are more accurate than other satellite-based precipitation estimates. To supplement the international exchange stations, additional ground observations were used to calibrate and improve the TMPA data with anomalies removed at an annual scale. Finally, a disaggregation strategy was adopted to derive monthly precipitation estimates based on the calibrated TMPA data.

In this paper, we study the usability of the Helsinki University of Technology (HUT) snow emission model for the estimation of SWE in a Canadian boreal forest environment. The experimental data (airborne passive microwave and ground-based data) were acquired during the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study winter field campaign held in February 1994 in Central Canada. Using the experimental dataset, surface brightness temperatures at 18 and 37 GHz (vertical polarization) were simulated with the HUT snow emission model and compared to those acquired by the airborne sensors. The results showed an important underestimation at 37 GHz (-27 K) and an overestimation at 18 GHz (10 K). In this paper, we demonstrate that the errors in the model simulations are due mainly to the extinction coefficient modeling, which is a function of snow grain size. Therefore, we propose a new semiempirical function for the extinction coefficient, based on an empirical correction to the Rayleigh scattering expression. Results presented in this paper show that the proposed function improves the HUT model accuracy to predict brightness temperature in the experimental context considered, with a mean error of /spl plusmn/5 K and /spl plusmn/9 K, respectively, at 18 and 37 GHz, and a negligible bias (less than 4 K) in both cases. These errors are comparable in magnitude to the accuracy of the radiometers used during the airborne flights. SWE was retrieved using the modified HUT snow emission model based on an iterative inversion technique. SWE was estimated with a mean error of /spl plusmn/10 mm and a negligible bias. Only a rough knowledge of mean snow grain size /spl phi/~ was required in the inversion procedure. The effects of possible errors on mean snow grain size /spl phi/~ are presented and discussed.	adobe atmosphere community server;airborne ranger;coefficient;iterative method;microwave;polarization (waves);rayleigh–ritz method;semi-empirical quantum chemistry method;sensitivity and specificity;sensor;simulation;snow;usability	Vincent Roy;Kalifa Goita;Alain Royer;Anne E.

In the study, we evaluated three newest soil moisture products that are the essential climate variable (ECV) soil moisture products (active-only, passive-only, and merged active-passive) which are the first multi-decadal satellite-based soil moisture data sets released by the European Space Agency recently. In-situ measurements used for validation are from three networks established in the Tibetan Plateau. The results show that all the ECV products can capture the soil moisture dynamics well. The active product performs better than the passive product when adding the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) data set and is less sensitive to vegetation cover, but both of them overestimate the ground measurements and exhibit higher variation than in-situ data. Overall, the combined product outperforms other two products. It can preserve the relative dynamics of the active and passive products very well and the number of observations is also improved, indicating a positive effect by merging both active and passive data sets in the Tibetan Plateau.	algorithm;refinement (computing)	Jiangyuan Zeng;Zhen Li;Quan Chen;Haiyun Bi	2015	2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7325851	water content;hydrology;yttrium;soil science;remote sensing	Metrics	84.06024715945036	-60.59334723918893	119026

The aim of this study was (i) to analyze the intensity-incidence angle behavior for coastal environments (sea and moist sand surfaces) and other surfaces (fields and urban area) with different reflectance models and (ii) to choose the best modeling for all these surfaces. We compared three reflection models. Firstly, diffuse reflection is introduced by Lambert's cosine law. The illuminated surfaces are composed of numerous small mirror-like facets inducing a dominant specular diffusion. This scattering of micro-facets is defined by the Beckmann distribution. The last model is a combination of diffuse and specular reflection. In this paper, we found that Beckmann distribution well simulates the intensity-incidence behavior for specular and diffuse mechanisms with the advantage to have only one parameter to characterize the studied surfaces.	diffuse reflection;incidence matrix;lambert's cosine law;specular highlight;topography	Emilie Poullain;Franck Garestier;Patrice Bretel;Franck Levoy	2012	2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6350838	moisture;probability distribution;lidar;hydrology;bathymetry;intensity;optics;sand;physics;angle of incidence;remote sensing	Robotics	84.73690391027617	-65.33460423623815	120040

The entire dataset comprised of 394 far infrared spectra which were divided into calibration (262 spectra) and validation (132 spectra) subsets. The far infrared (2.5 - 14.0 μm) spectra were first transformed into a wavelet power scalogram, and then linearly plotted against leaf water content. The six individual wavelet features identified in the mid infrared yielded high correlation with leaf water content (R2= 0.86 maximum, 0.83 minimum), as well as low RMSE (maximum 8.56%, minimum 9.27%). The combination of four wavelet features produced the most accurate model (R2= 0.88, RMSE= 8.00%). The models were consistent in terms of accuracy estimation for both calibration and validation datasets, indicating that leaf water content can be accurately retrieved from mid to thermal infrared electromagnetic radiation.	continuous wavelet;scaleogram	Saleem Ullah;Andrew K.

148ce938a91ef45fe0b19048123cb1170549a02c	improving the quality of satellite imagery based on ground-truth data from rain gauge stations		Multitemporal imagery is by and large geometrically and radiometrically accurate, but the residual noise arising from removal clouds and other atmospheric and electronic effects can produce outliers that must be mitigated to properly exploit the remote sensing information. In this study, we show how ground-truth data from rain gauge stations can improve the quality of satellite imagery. To this end, a simulation study is conducted wherein different sizes of outlier outbreaks are spread and randomly introduced in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the day and night land surface temperature (LST) of composite images from Navarre (Spain) between 2011 and 2015. To remove outliers, a new method called thin-plate splines with covariates (TpsWc) is proposed. This method consists of smoothing the median anomalies with a thin-plate spline model, whereby transformed ground-truth data are the external covariates of the model. The performance of the proposed method is measured with the square root of the mean square error (RMSE), calculated as the root of the pixel-by-pixel mean square differences between the original data and the predicted data with the TpsWc model and with a state-space model with and without covariates. The study shows that the use of ground-truth data reduces the RMSE in both the TpsWc model and the state-space model used for comparison purposes. The new method successfully removes the abnormal data while preserving the phenology of the raw data. The RMSE reduction percentage varies according to the derived variables (NDVI or LST), but reductions of up to 20% are achieved with the new proposal.	day and night (cellular automaton);ground truth;mean squared error;pixel;randomness;simulation;smoothing;state space;thin plate spline	Ana F.

e33e1862c6ada4a53ee7ee547db26d99535af8dd	assessment of regional vegetation response to climate anomalies: a case study for australia using gimms ndvi time series between 1982 and 2006	climate change;resistance;resilience;vegetation stability;non stationarity;australia;variance	Within the context of climate change, it is of utmost importance to quantify the stability of ecosystems with respect to climate anomalies. It is well acknowledged that ecosystem stability may change over time. As these temporal stability changes may provide a warning for increased vulnerability of the system, this study provides a methodology to quantify and assess these temporal changes in vegetation stability. Within this framework, vegetation stability changes were quantified over Australia from 1982 to 2006 using GIMMS NDVI and climate time series (i.e., SPEI (Standardized Precipitation and Evaporation Index)). Starting from a stability assessment on the complete time series, we aim to assess: (i) the magnitude and direction of stability changes; and (ii) the similarity in these changes for different stability metrics, i.e., the standard deviation of the NDVI anomaly (SD), auto-correlation at lag one of the NDVI anomaly (AC) and the correlation of NDVI anomaly with SPEI (CS). Results show high variability in magnitude and direction for the different stability metrics. Large areas and types of Australian vegetation showed an increase in variability (SD) over time; however, vegetation memory (AC) decreased. The association of NDVI anomalies with drought events (CS) showed a mixed response: the association increased in the western part, while it decreased in the eastern part. This methodology shows the potential for quantifying vegetation responses to major climate shifts and land use change, but results could be enhanced with higher resolution time series data.	anomaly detection;autocorrelation;bibo stability;ecosystem services;evaporation;heart rate variability;memory effect;spatial variability;the australian;time series	Wanda De Keersmaecker;Stefaan Lhermitte;Michael J.

963bd0f7bddaa9a950587779ceaa098c686bc717	modelling spatial distribution of the barents sea cod fishery		The paper presents a cellular automata (CA) model for the growth and spatially distribution of the Northeast Arctic cod including a harvest model based on economical rational behaviour. Rules and range of the CA model are estimated from observations and biological theory, and the environmental conditions are assumed to be in accordance with the IPCC A1B scenario for the following 45 years. The aim of the model developed is to study fleet behaviour based on available management decisions, resource information and economic performance. This paper presents fleet performance in the model under open access conditions, considering two different types of vessels (small and large) placed in four different homeports. Fleet smartness is a key parameter controlling the fish finding ability of each fleet. The study shows that increasing smartness reveals increasing differences between small and large vessels placed in different homeports. While homeport clusters vessels at low levels of smartness, vessel size and range clusters vessels at higher levels of smartness.

The Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) spinning enhanced visible and infrared imager (SEVIRI) (MSG-SEVIRI) offers this possibility, since it has a temporal resolution of 15 min. Current algorithms for SST retrieval from MSG-SEVIRI data use angular-dependent coefficients, but they do not use sea-surface emissivity (SSE) as an explicit input. This letter proposes a both angular- and emissivity-dependent split-window equation, together with simple equations to estimate SSE and atmospheric water-vapor content, with the aim of determining SST from MSG1/2-SEVIRI data. The first validation results point out the soundness of this sort of expression, even for large observation angles and under any sea and atmospheric states.	algorithm;angularjs;coefficient;image sensor;maxima and minima	Raquel Niclos;María José Estrela;Jose A.

We tested the efficacy of using satellite sea surface temperature (SST) collected by NASA’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and local water temperature collected from NOAA buoys and onshore stations to estimate submerged intertidal mussel logger temperatures. Daily SST and local water temperatures were compared to mussel logger temperatures at five study sites located along the Oregon coastline. We found that satellite-derived SSTs and local water temperatures were similarly correlated to the submerged mussel logger temperatures. This finding suggests that satellite-derived SSTs may be used in conjunction with local water temperatures to understand the temporal and spatial variation of mussel logger temperatures. While there are limitations to using satellite-derived temperature for ecological studies, including issues with temporal and spatial resolution, our results are promising.	data logger;ecosystem;keystroke logging;rocky's boots;sparse matrix;spatial variability	Jessica R.

We tested two approaches: (i) “Index-then-Blend” (IB); and (ii) “Blend-then-Index” (BI) when simulating nine indices, which are widely used for vegetation studies, environmental moisture assessment and standing water identification. Landsat-like indices, generated using both IB and BI, were simulated on 45 dates in total from three sites. The outputs were then compared with indices calculated from observed Landsat data and pixel-to-pixel accuracy of each simulation was assessed by calculating the: (i) bias; (ii) R; and (iii) Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD). The IB approach produced higher accuracies than the BI approach for both blending algorithms for OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2014, 6 9214 all nine indices at all three sites. We also found that the relative performance of the STARFM and ESTARFM algorithms depended on the spatial and temporal variances of the Landsat-MODIS input indices. Our study suggests that the IB approach should be implemented for blending of environmental indices, as it was: (i) less computationally expensive due to blending single indices rather than multiple bands; (ii) more accurate due to less error propagation; and (iii) less sensitive to the choice of algorithm.	ali corporation;algorithm;alpha compositing;analysis of algorithms;coefficient;downscaling;expanded memory;ion beam;methods of computing square roots;multispectral image;pixel;propagation of uncertainty;sensor;simulation;software propagation;switzerland;time series;tucker decomposition	Abdollah A.

1f8823c1cd264c0e4bd1a8889cc3c226c9dc3fbe	evaluating heavy-metal stress levels in rice using a theoretical model of canopy-air temperature and leaf area index based on remote sensing		Rapid and accurate analysis of heavy-metal contamination in crops is important with regard to human health, which has been made possible by the development of remote sensing technology. The objective of this study is to develop a theoretical model based on physical energy balance equations and remote sensing data to evaluate heavy-metal stress in rice based on physiological function responses. Heavy-metal stress can induce a series of variations in the physiological functions of plants, and canopy temperature is an indicator of these changes. Air temperature and leaf area index (LAI) can also affect the canopy temperature, and thus, these parameters were included in the model. Three extreme states of heavy-metal stress in rice were analyzed: (1) No stress just after transplant; (2) no stress; and (3) severe stress corresponding to the maximum possible LAI value. The theoretical model was based on the shape of a triangle, and a normalized heavy-metal stress index (HMSI) was proposed to describe the stress levels quantitatively. Validation by field experimentation showed that the HMSI is a reliable indicator of stress levels in rice. Because canopy temperature and LAI values can be obtained easily using remote sensing data, this method was further validated at the regional scale, and the distribution of heavy-metal stress levels across Zhuzhou County, Hunan Province, China, was rapidly determined.	hypothalamic area, lateral;motorola canopy;post-traumatic stress disorder;theory;energy balance	Ming Jin;Xiangnan Liu;Biyao Zhang	2017	IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing	10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2669204	remote sensing	HCI	85.01614644626808	-56.203906751897094	121379

The implementation of such systems in the Aegean Sea has established a pre-operational monitoring and forecasting capacity able to support oil-drift prediction applications and ongoing developments in ecological modeling. The monitoring basis of the system is an operational network of oceanographic buoys complemented by experimental or pre-operational components such as Ferry-Box systems, multi-parametric deep sea buoys and XBT observations from a VOS program. The hydrodynamic modeling system follows a downscaling approach and is able to reproduce general circulation and mesoscale dynamics while its forecasting skill is increased at open sea sites. Coupling to global forecasting systems, assimilation of data from the extended observing system, as well as further downscaling to coastal areas are ongoing efforts to improve the overall system performance. The oil-spill forecasting model developed for the POSEIDON system is being used to demonstrate the need of reliable oceanic forecast, especially in cases of low wind conditions when the general and mesoscale circulation is the predominant forcing factor. 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

0eb6fad473091268d17bf6ce6ea6a0e78055c8e1	estimation of daily solar radiation budget at kilometer resolution over the tibetan plateau by integrating modis data products and a dem	time series;topography;modis;solar radiation budget;tibetan plateau	Considering large and complex areas like the Tibetan Plateau, an analysis of the spatial distribution of the solar radiative budget over time not only requires the use of satellite remote sensing data, but also of an algorithm that accounts for strong variations of topography. Therefore, this research aims at developing a method to produce time series of solar radiative fluxes at high temporal and spatial resolution based on observed surface and atmosphere properties and topography. The objective is to account for the heterogeneity of the land surface using multiple land surface and atmospheric MODIS data products combined with a digital elevation model to produce estimations daily at the kilometric level. The developed approach led to the production of a three-year time series (2008–2010) of daily solar radiation budget at one kilometer spatial resolution across the Tibetan Plateau. The validation showed that the main improvement from the proposed method is a higher spatial and temporal resolution as compared to existing products. However, even if the solar radiation estimates are satisfying on clear sky conditions, the algorithm is less reliable under cloudy sky condition and the albedo product used here has a too coarse temporal resolution and is not accurate enough over rugged terrain.	algorithm;archive;computation;digital elevation model;pixel;relevance;rugged computer;time series;topography	Laure Roupioz;Li Jia;Françoise Nerry;Massimo Menenti	2016	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs8060504	meteorology;hydrology;topography;time series;statistics;remote sensing	HCI	84.24564970826606	-59.4383341620644	121815

The method is exemplarily demonstrated for the analysis of rheology of Arctic glaciers. More than two multitemporal interferometric data sets are combined in a least squares adjustment based on a Gauss-Markov model. Within the adjustment algorithm glacier flow is modeled by a polynomial function. This technique on the one hand allows us to improve the separation of topography- and displacement-related phase components and on the other hand provides glaciological information about the flow characteristics of observed glaciers.	least squares adjustment	F.W.

The total N, total P, Cu and Zn of chicken manure samples were predicted by NIR spectra. For the samples of each component, an ascending order was arranged and they were divided into calibration set and prediction set according to their content. Partial least square regression (PLSR) method was applied to construct the calibration model. Results showed that the correlation coefficients of the calibration model for total N was 0.69, the root mean square error of calibration (RMSEC) was 0.66, the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) was 0.80. For the models of total P, Cu and Zn, the results were r=0.86, RMSEC=0.29, RMSEP=0.34; r=0.95, RMSEC=3.46, RMSEP=5.71; r=0.94, RMSEC=14.13, RMSEP=25.21, respectively. The results indicated that the NIR spectroscopy was useful to non-destructively determine the content of total N, total P, Cu and Zn of chicken manure. As a complementary detecting method to the conventional analysis, NIR spectroscopy could significantly improve the detecting efficiency.	chicken;coefficient;diffuse reflection;mean squared error;partial least squares regression;sensor;sorting;test set;weatherstar	Yiwei Dong;Yongxing Chen;Dazhou Zhu;Yuzhong Li;Chunying Xu;Wei Bai;Yanan Wang;Qiaozhen Li	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-18354-6_13	chemistry;analytical chemistry;optics;nuclear magnetic resonance	Theory	87.20838292298275	-53.87165042538044	122004

However, remote estimation of leaf and canopy biochemical properties and vegetation condition remains challenging. In this paper, we (i) tested the performance of selected hyperspectral and broad band indices to predict chlorophyll concentration (CC) on mangrove leaves and (ii) showed the potential of Landsat 8 for estimation of mangrove CC at the landscape level. Relative leaf CC and leaf spectral response were measured at 12 Elementary Sampling Units (ESU) distributed along the northwest coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. Linear regression models and coefficients of determination were computed to measure the association between CC and spectral response. At leaf level, the narrow band indices with the largest correlation with CC were Vogelmann indices and the MTCI (R2 > 0.5). Indices with spectral bands around the red edge (705–753 nm) were more OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2015, 7 14531 sensitive to mangrove leaf CC. At the ESU level Landsat 8 NDVI green, which uses the green band in its formulation explained most of the variation in CC (R2 > 0.8). Accuracy assessment between estimated CC and observed CC using the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) method yielded a root mean squared error (RMSE) = 15 μg·cm−2, and R2 = 0.703. CC maps showing the spatiotemporal variation of CC at landscape scale were created using the linear model. Our results indicate that Landsat 8 NDVI green can be employed to estimate CC in large mangrove areas where ground networks cannot be applied, and mapping techniques based on satellite data, are necessary. Furthermore, using upcoming technologies that will include two bands around the red edge such as Sentinel 2 will improve mangrove monitoring at higher spatial and temporal resolutions.	algorithm;coefficient;computation;cross-validation (statistics);linear model;map;mean squared error;motorola canopy;multispectral image;sensor;spatial variability;visual instruction set	Julio Pastor-Guzman;Peter M.

The scattering mechanism in tidal flats was analyzed by the Freeman-Durden target decomposition and the target depolarization effect was quantitatively measured using the cross-polarized ratio. Strong multiple scattering and depolarization effect were observed in oyster reefs areas from C- and X-band data. These scattering signatures were also verified from in-situ measurenments using a ground-based polarimetric scatterometer system. However, no difference was observed between the scattering signatures of oyster reefs and mud flat areas from L-band data, which have a relatively longer wavelength. These results suggest that multi-frequency polarimetric SAR observations can be used to quantitatively detect the spatial distribution of oyster reefs in tidal flats.	antivirus software;electronic signature;l band;polarimetry;type signature	Byung-Hun Choe;Duk-jin Kim;Ji-Hwan Hwang;Yisok Oh;Wooil M.

Characteristic ranges of variability are interannual variability (cyclicity of fluctuations more than one year), annual cycles, synoptic variability (time scale of fluctuations from one day to several days), daily cycles, small-scale fluctuations (cyclicity from several seconds to one hour). The presence of multiscale variability causes nonstationarity of hydrometeorological processes. Variety of active factors results in spatial heterogeneity of fields (stratification of surface layer and seawater, movement of baric formations in an atmosphere and mesoscale eddies in oceans and seas). Traditionally the basis of objective laws of description of hydrometeorological field's variability is the analysis of full-scale data: shipboard observations during voyages, continuous observations at sea or coastal stations, satellite information. The intensive development of mathematical modeling methods on the basis of analytical and numerical solutions of system of termoand hydrodynamics equations under the appropriate initial and boundary conditions has allowed to fill up considerably this information base. It results from both reproduction of the measurement data in points of a regular grid by means of reanalysis [12], and obtaining information about nonobservable parameters on verified models. As a result, for example, we have wind waves [13], termohaline structure of waters and ecological system parameters [9].

The approach was tested in the case of fully polarimetric AirSAR images acquired over agricultural fields covered with soybean and corn crops. The single regressors were an empirical and a Bayesian approach. The approaches were applied to C and L band images and also to a combination of both frequencies. The results indicate that when the retrieved information from the regressors are properly combined based on the select figures of merit such as R2 and RMSE the accuracy can improve up to around 30%.	l band;polarimetry	Claudia Notarnicola	2013	2013 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium - IGARSS	10.1109/IGARSS.2013.6721259	crop;moisture;synthetic aperture radar;hydrology;soil science;regression analysis;remote sensing	Robotics	85.47804474921548	-61.56120185634034	123400

Previous researches demonstrated the atmospheric heterogeneity at regional scale and advocated that it is vital to get atmospheric parameters properly to retrieve LST precisely by using satellite remote sensing, especially for sensors provided with one thermal infrared channel (e.g. Landsat TM/ETM+). In this paper, MODIS standard atmospheric products (MOD 05 and MOD 07) were selected primarily due to its proximate passing over time to Landsat TM and its relatively high spatial resolution, compared with other ones. Different types of the total atmospheric water vapour (AWV) content were extracted from MOD 05 and MOD 07. At the same time, an interpolating procedure was proposed to estimate the land surface air temperature from MOD 07 air temperature profile. Then these parameters' performances were test in improving the accuracy of LST retrieved from the TM thermal band by means of the single-channel algorithm and the mono-window algorithm respectively, followed by discussions on LST validation processes. The validation results suggest that different atmospheric products and the interpolated parameters are useful for obtaining LST accurately from the single thermal band when local soundings are not available. In particular, the AWV content estimated from the near infrared (NIR) data, stored in MOD 05 provided relatively more accurate LST results when it was input into the single-channel algorithm with the root mean square error (RMSE) is about 1.3K. However, it is not within the scope of this study to find a superior retrieval method. At last, several issues related to the MODIS standard atmospheric products were suggested to be resolved, to enable more scientific and practical uses of this kind of products for atmospheric correction.	algorithm;atmospheric model;interpolation;mean squared error;performance;sensor	Feng Chen;Xiaofeng Zhao;Hong Ye;Huiying Hu	2011	Proceedings 2011 IEEE International Conference on Spatial Data Mining and Geographical Knowledge Services	10.1109/ICSDM.2011.5969079	water content;data mining;radiometer;earth;geographic information system;satellite;pixel;remote sensing	Visualization	84.6044868184363	-61.80856212863317	123528

The approach combines the relatively noisy 3-km radar backscatter coefficients and the more accurate 36-km radiometer brightness temperature into an optimal 10-km product. In preparation for the SMAP mission, an observation system simulation experiment (OSSE) and field experimental campaigns using the Passive and Active L- and S-band Airborne Sensor (PALS) have been conducted. We use the PALS airborne observations and OSSE data to test the algorithm and develop an error budget table. When applied to four-month OSSE data, the change detection method is shown to perform better than direct inversion of the radiometer brightness temperatures alone, improving the root mean square error by 2% volumetric soil moisture content. The main assumptions of the algorithm are verified using PALS data from the soil moisture experiments held during June-July 2002 (Soil Moisture Experiment 2002) in Iowa. The algorithm error budget is estimated and shown to meet SMAP science requirements.	airborne ranger;algorithm;coefficient;experiment;image resolution;l band;mean squared error;radar;requirement;simulation	Maria Piles;Dara Entekhabi;Adriano Camps	2009	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2009.2022088	meteorology;water content;hydrology;optics;physics;remote sensing	Visualization	83.45903609365281	-63.746820171533216	123771

After field work a 2D profile was automatically extracted from the image. The profiles extracted from the photographs were analyzed using root mean square height and correlation length as function of measured length. 777 profiles were measured during the SORTEX -campaign in different locations with different canopy type, including marshland, pine, birch and mixed forest and lake ice. In addition to this some profiles were measured in February 2010. The results show a clear shift from midwinter to melting season conditions as well as the effect of fresh snow on the surface.	mean squared error;midwinter;motorola canopy;photogrammetry;root-finding algorithm	Kati Anttila;Terhikki Manninen;Tuure Karjalainen;Panu Lahtinen;Aku Riihelä;Niilo Siljamo	2012	2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6352525	meteorology;snow;surface roughness;geology;hydrology;vegetation;photogrammetry;remote sensing	Vision	83.41632483563146	-61.62606495897707	123804

According to the previous research, the depletion of O3 would cause the increase of surface ultraviolet radiation, which has a strong negative ecological effect on the biosphere. In the situation, it is very meaningful for us to study the spatial and temporal characteristics of O3 in China based on remote sensing data. In this paper, we divided China into eight natural geographic regions, which were South China region, Southwest region, Central China region, Sichuan Basin region, Tibetan Plateau region, North China region, Inner Mongolia-Northwest region and Northeast region according to China Natural Geographic Regionalization and some previous research work on ozone in China. The calculation results revealed that: (1) The spatial characteristics of the annual and seasonal ozone in China had obvious differences in latitudinal direction. The spring averaged ozone was the biggest among four seasons, followed by winter, summer, and autumn. (2) The highest of the annual ozone was in Northeast region in eight natural geographic regions, the smallest was Southwest region. The highest value of ozone for four seasons was in Northeast China, and the lowest value occurred in South China region for spring and winter, in Tibetan Plateau region for summer and in Southwest region for autumn. (3) The seasonal and monthly change ranges of total ozone were significant in eight natural geographic regions of China, and most of them presented decreased, which showed that the total ozone in China had a decreasing tendency.	biosphere;dvd region code;depletion region	Meiling Huang;Hong Jiang;Zhongyong Xiao	2010	2010 18th International Conference on Geoinformatics	10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2010.5567846	meteorology;geography;climatology	Visualization	83.61346610192459	-56.692442316849124	123989

The study period comprises three years (2012, 2013 and 2014). In the drought year (2012), the annual ET and GPP were ∼24% and ∼12% lower than the average for the wet years (2013 and 2014). The 2012 drought caused a higher impact on ET in comparison with GPP. Overall, the reductions on ET and GPP occurred as expected and are related to the fact that long periods with low precipitation can deplete soil moisture, inducing stomatal closure and leading to a decline in the photosynthesis rate.	graph partition	Gabriel de Oliveira;Nathaniel A.

507106e6f5de4cbbf155d367465b1ac96e5632ea	multitemporal field-based plant height estimation using 3d point clouds generated from small unmanned aerial systems high-resolution imagery		Abstract Plant breeders and agronomists are increasingly interested in repeated plant height measurements over large experimental fields to study critical aspects of plant physiology, genetics and environmental conditions during plant growth. However, collecting such measurements using commonly used manual field measurements is inefficient. 3D point clouds generated from unmanned aerial systems (UAS) images using Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques offer a new option for efficiently deriving in-field crop height data. This study evaluated UAS/SfM for multitemporal 3D crop modelling and developed and assessed a methodology for estimating plant height data from point clouds generated using SfM. High-resolution images in visible spectrum were collected weekly across 12 dates from April (planting) to July (harvest) 2016 over 288 maize ( Zea mays L.) and 460 sorghum ( Sorghum bicolor L.) plots using a DJI Phantom 3 Professional UAS. The study compared SfM point clouds with terrestrial lidar (TLS) at two dates to evaluate the ability of SfM point clouds to accurately capture ground surfaces and crop canopies, both of which are critical for plant height estimation. Extended plant height comparisons were carried out between SfM plant height (the 90th, 95th, 99th percentiles and maximum height) per plot and field plant height measurements at six dates throughout the growing season to test the repeatability and consistency of SfM estimates. High correlations were observed between SfM and TLS data (R 2  = 0.88–0.97, RMSE = 0.01–0.02 m and R 2  = 0.60–0.77 RMSE = 0.12–0.16 m for the ground surface and canopy comparison, respectively). Extended height comparisons also showed strong correlations (R 2  = 0.42–0.91, RMSE = 0.11–0.19 m for maize and R 2  = 0.61–0.85, RMSE = 0.12–0.24 m for sorghum). In general, the 90th, 95th and 99th percentile height metrics had higher correlations to field measurements than the maximum metric though differences among them were not statistically significant. The accuracy of SfM plant height estimates fluctuated over the growing period, likely impacted by the changing reflectance regime due to plant development. Overall, these results show a potential path to reducing laborious manual height measurement and enhancing plant research programs through UAS and SfM.	aerial photography;image resolution;point cloud;unmanned aerial vehicle	Lonesome Malambo;Sorin C.

The approach relies on the use of Ansoft's numerical computation software High-Frequency Structure Simulator, which solves Maxwell's equations directly using the finite-element method. The interest of this approach is that it can be easily extended to studies of heterogeneous media. However, before being applied in this way, it must first be validated for the rough-surface case. In this letter, we perform this validation by comparing the results of rough-surface scattering and emission with the results of the method of moments (MoM) for a range of different roughness and permittivity conditions and with both Gaussian and exponential rough-surface autocorrelation functions. For the scattering case, we obtain results that are in agreement with the MoM to within approximately 1-3 dB for angles up to and including 40° and 2-4 dB for angles from 50° to 70°. Agreement for emissivity is to within 3.2 and 3.6 K for low and high roughness conditions, respectively. We then illustrate the application of the new approach by calculating the emission of a two-layer system with rough surfaces, representing the soil-litter system in forests.	autocorrelation;boundary element method;computation;finite element method;hfss;maxwell (microarchitecture);numerical analysis;requirement;rough set;time complexity	Heather Lawrence;François Demontoux;Jean-Pierre Wigneron;Philippe Paillou;Tzong-Dar Wu;Yann Kerr	2011	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2011.2131633	computer simulation;hydrology;finite element method;mathematics;optics;physics;statistics	Embedded	84.58540075246195	-67.09923168834624	124434

The method employed is based on 4th degree polynomial fitting of the correlation matrix between VIIRS and MODIS reference images in the swath (pixel-line) projection. Sensitivity analysis has shown that the uncertainty from this method is better that $\pm 0.04$ of the VIIRS I-band pixel size. Analysis of geolocation accuracy conducted over the 2017 period at semi-monthly intervals has shown that the average geolocation bias for VIIRS/S-NPP band I2 was 0.055 (0.003) along (across) the scan directions. Corresponding numbers are 0.028 (−0.003) for band M7.	geolocation;pixel;polynomial;semiconductor industry	Alexander P.

e162ffae3e5564a9f6d86719fc786ec961fa1f92	detecting microplastics pollution in world oceans using sar remote sensing		Plastic pollution in world oceans is estimated to have reached 270.000 tones, or 5.25 trillion pieces. This plastic is now ubiquitous, however due to ocean circulation patterns, it accumulates in the ocean gyres, creating “garbage patches”. This plastic debris is colonized by microorganisms which can create unique surfactants and bio-film ecosystems. Microbial colonization is the first step towards disintegration and degradation of plastic materials: a process that releases metabolic by-products from energy synthesis. These byproducts include the release of short-chain and more complex carbon molecules in the form of surfactants, which we hypothesize will affect the fluid dynamic properties of waves (change in viscosity and surface tension) and make them detectable by the SAR sensor. In this study we used Sentinel-1A and COSMO-SkyMed SAR images in selected sites of the North Pacific and North Atlantic oceans, close to the ocean gyres and away from the coastal interference. Together with SAR processing we conducted contextual image analysis, using ocean geophysical products of the sea surface temperature, surface wind, chlorophyll, wave heights and wave spectrum of the ocean surface. In addition, we started lab experiments under controlled conditions to test the behaviour of microbes colonizing the two most common marine pollutants, polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) microplastics. The analysis of the SAR images had shown that a combination of surface wind speed and Langmuir cells- ocean circulation pattern is the main controlling factor in creating the distinct appearance of the surfactants, sea-slicks and microbial bio-films. The preliminary conclusion of our study is that SAR remote sensing may be able to detect plastic pollution in the open oceans and this method can be extended to other areas.

a0dd5369434d707d7652ebaed3102466f75df05b	the combined aster modis emissivity over land (camel) part 2: uncertainty and validation		Under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity project, a new global land surface emissivity dataset has been produced by the University of Wisconsin–Madison Space Science and Engineering Center and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). This new dataset termed the Combined ASTER MODIS Emissivity over Land (CAMEL), is created by the merging of the UW–Madison MODIS baseline-fit emissivity dataset (UWIREMIS) and JPL’s ASTER Global Emissivity Dataset v4 (GEDv4). CAMEL consists of a monthly, 0.05◦ resolution emissivity for 13 hinge points within the 3.6–14.3 μm region and is extended to 417 infrared spectral channels using a principal component regression approach. An uncertainty product is provided for the 13 hinge point emissivities by combining temporal, spatial, and algorithm variability as part of a total uncertainty estimate. Part 1 of this paper series describes the methodology for creating the CAMEL emissivity product and the corresponding high spectral resolution algorithm. This paper, Part 2 of the series, details the methodology of the CAMEL uncertainty calculation and provides an assessment of the CAMEL emissivity product through comparisons with (1) ground site lab measurements; (2) a long-term Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) emissivity dataset derived from 8 years of data; and (3) forward-modeled IASI brightness temperatures using the Radiative Transfer for TOVS (RTTOV) radiative transfer model. Global monthly results are shown for different seasons and International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme land classifications, and case study examples are shown for locations with different land surface types.	algorithm;automatic sounding;baseline (configuration management);biosphere;brainfuck;dots per inch;earth system science;level of detail;numerical weather prediction;pac-land;principal component analysis;principal component regression;spatial variability;stellar classification	Michelle Feltz;Eva Borbas;Robert O.

We found that the hotspot calculated from the MODIS BRDF product is underestimated in comparison with POLarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances (POLDER) measurements very near the hotspot, so the MODIS-derived CI could be overestimated without correcting the bias. We developed an approach to correct the MODIS hotspot magnitude against synchronous co-registered POLDER-3 data. Field measured CIs by the Tracing Radiation and Architecture of Canopies instrument from 38 sites were used to evaluate the global CI map. Validation indicates that a strong correlation between MODIS-derived NDHD and CI indeed exists, and red band is better than near infrared band in effectively capturing the structural differences among cover types.	bidirectional reflectance distribution function;bus bunching;polarization (waves)	Liming He;Jing M.

This phenomenon is mainly related to the limited water resources availability, the lack of supporting irrigation and the harvesting techniques ineffectiveness. The production risks reduction is closely related with a better use of water resources and a better understanding of the effects resulting from the multiple interactions between climate, agricultural vegetation, soil type and crops management techniques. In this study, a remote and automatic agricultural monitoring system is presented as an effective alternative to the most traditional in situ measurements and observations.	interaction	Roberto Luciani;Giovanni Laneve;Munzer Jahjah	2018	IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8519418	vegetation;soil type;remote sensing;irrigation;agriculture;crop yield;water resources;phenomenon;computer science;in situ;agronomy	Arch	84.16690597729354	-56.94175539899186	125269

A methodology is proposed to estimate the CHTC""""S""""M for a building surface, by combining local wind climate information and information on the CHTC, namely CHTC-U""""1""""0 correlations, where U""""1""""0 is the mean wind speed at a height of 10m above the ground. This methodology is applied to a cubic building for a specific wind climate, where the CHTC-U""""1""""0 correlations are obtained by means of CFD simulations (CFD code Fluent 6.3, realizable k-@? turbulence model). It is shown that the CHTC""""S""""M varied significantly with the orientation of the building surface due to the rather anisotropic wind conditions, where high values are found for surfaces oriented towards the prevailing wind directions, thus for windward conditions. Moreover, the evaluation of the CHTC""""S""""M for other wind climates clearly shows that the local wind conditions also can have a significant impact on the overall magnitude of the CHTC""""S""""M, where differences up to a factor 4 are found in this study. Different levels of complexity for determining the CHTC""""S""""M value are also evaluated and it is found that the required number of CFD simulations can be reduced significantly by using more simplified methods to calculate the CHTC""""S""""M, without compromising its accuracy. The applicability of the proposed methodology for other building-related applications is also discussed, for example to assess statistical mean pressure coefficients, wind-driven ventilation rates or convective mass transfer coefficients."""

Large residuals occur with two types of tropospheric anomalies: the vertical duct and horizontal non-nominal troposphere. Through analyzing 8 years of meteorological data from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), we find that the two types of anomalies can occur simultaneously. In addition, the existing vertical protection level (VPL) calculation method under tropospheric anomalies is based on the least squares method, which is not applicable to Sea-Based JPALS using the Kalman filter. Therefore, we start by calculating the zenith duct error by numerical integration. The maximum error observed is 45.64 mm, and the error seasonal characteristic is analyzed. For the non-nominal troposphere, the worst meteorological conditions in the Chinese surrounding sea areas are used to calculate the non-nominal errors, which are fitted to a satellite-elevation-dependent model. Then, a VPL calculation method based on the Kalman filter under tropospheric anomalies is proposed. Finally, a multiple approach simulation is conducted. The results show that the average VPL increments introduced by the duct and non-nominal troposphere anomalies are 0.082 m and 0.211 m, respectively, with growth percentages of 12.903% and 30.857%, respectively. The increment under simultaneous anomalies is 0.272 m with a growth of 40.427%. Furthermore, the average availability under normal conditions is 100%. Considering the duct and the non-nominal troposphere anomalies, the availability loss is 0.017% and 3.674%, respectively. Under simultaneous anomalies, this loss is 4.743%.	airborne ranger;anomaly detection;ebstein anomaly;experiment;hearing loss, mixed conductive-sensorineural;increment;joint precision approach and landing system;kalman filter;large;least squares;least-squares analysis;manuscripts;natural science disciplines;numerical analysis;numerical integration;projections and predictions;satellite navigation;scientific publication;seizures;simulation;vpl research;vertical disease transmission;sensor (device)	Yue Zhang;Zhipeng Wang	2018		10.3390/s18082579	electronic engineering;atmospheric sciences;engineering;troposphere;joint precision approach and landing system	Visualization	85.27515439629384	-58.78543209712006	125420

Recently, an increasing attention has been paid to the issue of impact of land use and land cover change on environment and water quality. In this paper, we analyzed the land use and land cover change by using RS and GIS, and simulated its implications in runoff from 1991 to 2000 using SCS model in the Foping Nature Reserve, Shan 'xi Province. Our results showed that this region were main plantation, woodland and grassland. Woodland area increased significantly, while plantation and grassland area decreased, which would greatly affect runoff. Meanwhile, the results show that woodland area and land cover area are negatively correlated with the runoff.	geographic information system;typset and runoff	Yi Guo;Xiaoping Huang;Jingqian Peng	2009	J.

Under a cloud-free condition, atmospheric and surface radiative components can be derived from atmospheric temperature and water vapor, and surface temperature data. Thus, the quality of these auxiliary data sets directly affects the emissivity accuracy. From an emission-based radiative transfer equation, a set of relationships is derived to study the sensitivity of surface emissivity to the errors of brightness temperature, atmospheric transmittance, and surface temperature. As an example, the uncertainties in the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System emissivity at 23 and 89 GHz may be much larger than the uncertainties of emissivity at lower frequencies due to the higher uncertainties in computing the water vapor absorption. The error in the land surface temperature is a main source of error in emissivity at the frequencies less than 19 GHz.	advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer;microwave	Hu Yang;Fuzhong Weng	2011	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2011.2125794	meteorology;radiative transfer;atmospheric sciences;thermal emittance;emissivity;physics;quantum mechanics;remote sensing	Visualization	83.55326716261307	-63.284053626836865	127596

In this context it has been shown that the identification of main crops and annual crop rotation in the Rur catchment by SPOT, LANDSAT and ASTER imagery provides the key for a spatial and thematic enhancement of the model results. The spatial resolution of the nitrogen surplus data set which denotes the linkage between RAUMIS and GROWA is enhanced from district level to field/pixel level. In parallel, the empirical water balance model GROWA is enhanced to differentiate between agricultural crops in the real evapotranspiration calculation. It is calibrated by runoff data measured at gauging stations. Results indicate, e.g., an average nitrate concentration in the leachate of 42 mg NO3/L in the relatively wet year of 2002 and almost 62 mg NO3/L in the dry year of 2003. There is a 20 mg NO3/L weather-induced difference which can be modelled in a more detailed way using self-processed remotely sensed data. The model results were compared to nitrate concentrations observed in the top parts of multi-level wells. In this way the related coefficient of determination has been improved from a value (R) of 0.50 using CORINE to 0.59 by using self-processed remotely sensed data, thus demonstrating the potential of the enhanced model system. 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

With this model we aim at characterizing the multidimensional stochastic error structure of satellite rainfall estimates as a function of scale. The pertinent error dimensions we seek to address are: 1) the joint probability density function for characterizing the spatial structure of the successful delineation of rainy and nonrainy areas; 2) the temporal dynamics of rain estimation bias; and 3) the spatial variability of rain rate estimation error. Ground radar rain fields in the Southern plains of the United States are used as reference to evaluate SREM2D error parameters at 0.25-deg and hourly spatiotemporal resolution for an infrared (IR) rain retrieval algorithm (IR-3B41RT) developed at NASA. Comparison of SREM2D simulated satellite rainfall with actual IR-3B41RT data showed that the error modeling technique can preserve the estimation error characteristics across scales with marginal deviations. The model performance is compared against two simpler, but widely used, approaches of error modeling that do not account for uncertainty in rainy/nonrainy area delineation. It is shown that both of these approaches fare poorly with regards to preserving the error structure across scales. They underestimated the sensor retrieval error standard deviation by more than 100% upon aggregation, which, for SREM2D, was found to be below 30%. SREM2D is modular in design-it can be applied for any satellite rainfall algorithm to consistently characterize its error structure."""	algorithm;marginal model;relevance;simulation;spatial variability	Faisal Hossain;Emmanouil N.

88746a16bca4c34df640e8c15e362ab6653bf1df	assimilation of fire perimeters and satellite detections by minimization of the residual in a fire spread model		Assimilation of data into a fire-spread model is formulated as an optimization problem. The level set equation, which relates the fire arrival time and the rate of spread, is allowed to be satisfied only approximately, and we minimize a norm of the residual. Previous methods based on modification of the fire arrival time either used an additive correction to the fire arrival time, or made a position correction. Unlike additive fire arrival time corrections, the new method respects the dependence of the fire rate of spread on diurnal changes of fuel moisture and on weather changes, and, unlike position corrections, it respects the dependence of the fire spread on fuels and terrain as well. The method is used to interpolate the fire arrival time between two perimeters by imposing the fire arrival time at the perimeters as constraints.		Angel Farguell Caus;James Haley;Adam K.

In this letter, in order to solve the problem of surface vegetation parameter retrieval by using microwave remote sensing, a modified water-cloud model (WCM) was developed to retrieve leaf area index (LAI) by adding vegetation coverage and direct effect of bare soil on the total backscatter coefficients, which fully took into account the distribution of vegetation cover. The modified model was validated between the simulated backscatter coefficients and measurements based on ground observations and RADARSAT-2 data in China. Then, a look-up table algorithm was applied to calculate the value of vegetation water content and retrieve LAI according to a linear relationship between vegetation water content and LAI. Results indicated that the modified model was more sensitive to vegetation condition and the estimation accuracy was higher than that of the original WCM. R2 and rmse were 85.0% and 0.918 dB in 1111 polarization, and 73.9% and 1.475 dB in VV polarization, respectively. Meanwhile, the modified model could separate the scattering influences produced by the vegetation cover and bare soil components on the backscatter coefficients effectively. The accuracy of LAI retrieval was significantly high with R2 and rmse of 84.1% and 0.233 m2/m2, respectively. This method will provide support for estimating LAI of winter wheat by using radar data in a wide range.	algorithm;backscatter (email);coefficient;estimation theory;lookup table;microwave;polarization (waves);sparse matrix;verification and validation;web content management system	Liangliang Tao;Jing Li;Jinbao Jiang;Xi Chen	2016	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2016.2546945	enhanced vegetation index;database index;synthetic aperture radar;hydrology;soil science;scattering;backscatter;physics;quantum mechanics;remote sensing	HCI	84.75210082210279	-62.15394944064512	127934
5a6d63380f8f65fecd9a0bfb19abd00bc7f81536	normalized difference vegetation index as an estimator for abundance and quality of avian herbivore forage in arctic alaska		Tools that can monitor biomass and nutritional quality of forage plants are needed to understand how arctic herbivores may respond to the rapidly changing environment at high latitudes. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been widely used to assess changes in abundance and distribution of terrestrial vegetative communities. However, the efficacy of NDVI to measure seasonal changes in biomass and nutritional quality of forage plants in the Arctic remains largely un-evaluated at landscape and fine-scale levels. We modeled the relationships between NDVI and seasonal changes in aboveground biomass and nitrogen concentration in halophytic graminoids, a key food source for arctic-nesting geese. The model was calibrated based on data collected at one site and validated using data from another site. Effects of spatial scale on model accuracy were determined by comparing model predictions between NDVI derived from moderate resolution (250 × 250 m pixels) satellite data and high resolution (20 cm diameter area) handheld spectrometer data. NDVI derived from the handheld spectrometer was a superior estimator (R2 ≥ 0.67) of seasonal changes in aboveground biomass compared to satellite-derived NDVI (R2 ≤ 0.40). The addition of temperature and precipitation variables to the model for biomass improved fit, but provided minor gains in predictive power beyond that of the NDVI-only model. This model, however, was only a moderately accurate estimator of biomass in an ecologically-similar halophytic graminoid wetland located 100 km away, indicating the necessity for site-specific validation. In contrast to assessments of biomass, satellite-derived NDVI was a better estimator for the timing of peak percent of nitrogen than NDVI derived from the handheld spectrometer. We confirmed that the date when NDVI reached 50% of its seasonal maximum was a reasonable approximation of the period of peak spring vegetative green-up and peak percent nitrogen. This study demonstrates the importance of matching the scale of NDVI measurements to the vegetation properties of biomass and nitrogen phenology.	approximation;calibration (statistics);ecology;handheld game console;image resolution;persistent vegetative state;pixel;spatial scale;terrestrial television	Kyle R.

29a0898124f4f718954498e8df14c469d135f4c3	dbclim: a web-based, open-source relational database for rainfall event studies	database;rainfall events;open source solutions;climate data	Rainfall is a climatic parameter of great importance and complexity. The pluviometric parameters ordinarily taken for meteo-hydrologic study are rainfall total and maxima (annual, seasonal or monthly), maximum rainfall over several consecutive days (by definition usually 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 days), rainfall during brief but intense rainstorms, and peak rainfall within temporal units (minutes, hours, days). Values of absolute extremes, such as the highest 5-day precipitation amount in a year, can often be related to extreme events that affect human society and the natural environment (Klein Tank and Zwiers, 2009). Moreover, the data of some of these parameters may be derived from various different rain events and an event can last more than 5 consecutive days. In studies on geo-hydrologic risk mitigation, flood risk prevention and advance warning in civil protection, for example, it is also important to evaluate not only how much rain but how it falls. This can be done by considering a rain event (RE) as a defined meteo-climatic variable. For these purposes it is useful to define a given RE as one or more consecutive rainy days with a daily rainfall depth Z1 mm. This approach is essential to studying rainfall events within a broader scope because the RE acts directly on landscape modeling.

When glacial ice such as icebergs and ice shelves are dominant in an AMSR-E footprint, the accuracy of NT2 algorithm is not well maintained. We extracted the concentrations of sea ice and glacial ice from two ENVISAT ASAR images of southern Antarctica, and compared them with NT2 SIC. The result showed that the NT2 algorithm underestimates the concentration of glacial ice. We also found that glacial ice occupies a unique region in the PR (polarization ratio), GR (spectral gradient ratio), PRR (rotated PR), and ΔGR domain different from other types of ice such as ice type A, B, and C, and open water. This implies that glacial ice concentration can be added as a new category of ice to the NT2 algorithm.	algorithm;display resolution;gradient;performance rating;polarization (waves);production rule representation;simplified instructional computer	Hyangsun Han;Hoonyol Lee	2011	2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049579	meteorology;lead;drift ice;sea ice thickness;antarctic sea ice;iceberg;snow;arctic ice pack;fast ice;seawater;glaciology;cryosphere;ice core;ice shelf;oceanography;geology;integrated circuit;ice sheet;climatology;sea ice concentration;accuracy and precision;glacier;ice stream;sea ice	Embedded	83.6007182891604	-62.38859541582056	128215

Based on three payloads of WCOM mission with L-S bands passive observations and X/Ku active/passive observations, there are obvious advantages in soil moisture retrieval. Through evaluations of the Advanced Integral Equation Model (AIEM) simulating dataset, it was found that the bare surface emission signals of L-S bands are essentially equal. Accounting for the vegetation effects, the method of soil moisture retrieval with L/S bands can increase soil moisture estimation accuracy, compared with using single L band observations. The RMSE of soil moisture estimated from PALS(Passive Active L- and S-band Sensor) dual frequency radiometer data is 0.048m3/m3 with L band, and RMSE is raised to 0.035m3/m3 with L/S bands. According to the active/passive configuration of WCOM, we developed two soil moisture downscaling methods with active/passive measurements and L-S bands passive measurements, and obtain high resolution soil moisture products. Based on zeroth order approximation model, it was found that there are linear relationship between the L-S band TBs (brightness temperature), and also between the active/passive observations. The RMSE of the spectral active/passive downscaling soil moisture is 0.0459m3/m3. The RMSE of downscaling results of L/S band TB are 2.8 K and 1.7 K for V/H polarization respectively. These results showed that we can get high accurate and high resolution soil moisture products from WCOM and then benefit to various applications.	downscaling;image resolution;ku band;l band;order of approximation;polarization (waves);simulation;terabyte	Jiancheng Shi;Panpan Yao;Tianjie Zhao	2016	2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729888	water content;hydrology;soil science;mathematical model;remote sensing	Robotics	84.28538167065828	-62.44716622257569	128301

The investigation is based on a nearly 30-year time series data set compiled from interpreted satellite imagery. The SLEUTH urban growth model which based CA was calibrated using the multitemporal data sets for the entire study region and predicted the urban growth to the year 2020. Spatial metrics coming from landscape metrics were used both specifically to assess the impact of urban development in four periods, and generally to analyze the spatial and temporal dynamics of urban form. The results illustrate the utility of modeling in explaining the amount and spatial change of urban form. The result suggested that the change of urban form show a period of urban sprawl and diffuse growth in the time of 1979 and 2000. After the year of 2008, spatial complexity declined as most of the urban areas grew more compact through infilling, developing the vacant land between the sprawling urban patches. The combined approach using remote sensing, spatial metrics and urban modeling may prove a productive new direction for the improved understanding, representation and modeling of the urban spatiotemporal patterns. Although the integrated approach is powerful, the forecasting of urban form remains problematic and could benefit from further research on spatial metrics and urban model.	compiler;population dynamics;software metric;spatial analysis;spatiotemporal pattern;time series	Zhenlong Zhang;Lingde Jiang;Rui Peng;Yixing Yin	2010	2010 18th International Conference on Geoinformatics	10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2010.5567753	geography;cartography;remote sensing	HCI	84.12754755278655	-55.83418106360148	128305

It is therefore important that objective assessments of the current use of water are undertaken on a routine basis. New remote sensing technologies now provide an opportunity to assess and monitor water use at farm and regional scales. This study demonstrates the use of satellite-based estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) and NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index) in irrigation performance indicators that relate crop water use to crop water requirement (CWR) in the Macalister Irrigation District of south-eastern Australia. The METRIC energy balance algorithm (Allen et al 2007) was used to derive ET estimates from Landsat 7 ETM+ data. ASTER imagery was used to complement the spatial coverage of the Landsat 7 imagery due to the gaps in the scene acquired.	algorithm;irrigation informatics;metric	Mohammad Abuzar;Andy McAllister;Des Whitfield;Kathryn Sheffield	2012			water use;environmental science;evapotranspiration;normalized difference vegetation index;irrigation;remote sensing;vegetation index;irrigation district;water resources	HCI	84.13871006124624	-57.832549504550066	129384

Assessment of the radiometric calibration of the AVNIR-2 multi-spectral imager is achieved via three intercomparisons to currently flying sensors over the Libyan desert, during the first year of operation. All three methodologies indicate a slight underestimation of AVNIR-2 in band 1 by 4 to 7 % with respect to other sensors radiometric scale. Band 2 does not show any obvious bias. Results for band 3 are affected by saturation due to inappropriate gain setting. Two methodologies indicate no significant bias in band 4.

SRAD is grid based, and factors in both topoand meso-scaled processes using a digital elevation model (DEM) and local monthly atmospheric parameters as inputs. SRAD generates estimates of incident, outgoing, and net irradiance, as well as surface and air temperatures for each point in the DEM, over any time period ranging from one day to one year. Cloudiness and other atmospheric conditions are factored into the shortwave irradiance estimates. From the DEM, the terrain e ects of slope angle, aspect, and topographic shading are calculated and used to modify the estimates of shortwave irradiance. The SRAD-generated irradiance estimates for the study region were found to be consistent with irradiance data from other sources. Estimates of irradiance were most sensitive to the parameters of sunshine fraction and cloudiness. Radiation estimates were generated and compared using both a 20 m and a 100 m resolution DEM. Extremely low irradiance estimates generated at the ® ne scale were absent at the coarser scale. However the mean value of irradiance at both scales was estimated to be the same at 12 .4 MJmÕ 2 day Õ 1 annually. Radiation estimates were also determined at the two scales for a series of forest research plots. For 91% of the plots, the irradiance estimates during the growing season di ered by less than 0 .5 MJmÕ 2 day Õ 1 between the two scales. Results presented here suggest that SRAD can provide useful input for predictive spatial models in boreal forest ecosystems.	digital elevation model;ecosystem;mesoscopic physics;shading;topography	Daniel W.

The interaction between apple tree leaves and sun light was analyzed through investigating the characteristics of spectral signatures of leaves, and a portable chlorophyll and nitrogen concentration detector was developed for apple tree leaves. Firstly 60 apple tree leaf samples were collected. The chlorophyll, nitrogen concentrations and reflectance were acquired in laboratories, then the spectral features of samples were analyzed, and light reaction characteristics were revealed accordingly. Therefore, the characteristic wavebands were obtained to predict the chlorophyll and nitrogen content in apple tree leaves effectively, and then the determination models for forecasting chlorophyll and nitrogen concentrations in apple leaves were established and validated. Finally a portable chlorophyll and nitrogen contents detector for apple leaves was developed based on the determination models. The performance test results showed that the detector could be used to detect the chlorophyll and nitrogen concentrations in apple leaves with high accuracy.	antivirus software;emoticon;mobile device;nl (complexity);orchard;sensor;tree (data structure)	Yao Zhang;Lihua Zheng;Hong Sun;Wei Yang	2015	Intelligent Automation & Soft Computing	10.1080/10798587.2015.1015768	spectroscopy;normalized difference vegetation index;nitrogen	Robotics	86.44503922600776	-54.12920471998033	129878

Two of the bands (J, K) are located in the mid-infrared (3-5 /spl mu/m) wavelength region: J, 3.5-4.1 /spl mu/m and K, 4.9-5.1 /spl mu/m, and three of the bands (L, M, N) are located in the thermal infrared (8-12 /spl mu/m) wavelength region: L, 8.0-8.4 /spl mu/m; M, 8.4-8.8 /spl mu/m; and N, 10.2-10.7 /spl mu/m. The absolute radiometric accuracy of the MTI data acquired in bands J-N was assessed over a period of approximately three years using data from the Lake Tahoe, CA/NV, automated validation site. Assessment involved using a radiative transfer model to propagate surface skin temperature measurements made at the time of the MTI overpass to predict the vicarious at-sensor radiance. The vicarious at-sensor radiance was convolved with the MTI system response functions to obtain the vicarious at-sensor MTI radiance in bands J-N. The vicarious radiances were then compared with the instrument measured radiances. In order to avoid any reflected solar contribution in the mid-infrared bands, only nighttime scenes were used in the analysis of bands J and K. Twelve cloud-free scenes were used in the analysis of the data from the mid-infrared bands (J, K), and 23 cloud-free scenes were used in the analysis of the thermal infrared bands (L, M, N). The scenes had skin temperatures ranging between 4.4 and 18.6/spl deg/C. The skin temperature was found to be, on average, 0.18/spl plusmn/0.36 degC cooler than the bulk temperature during the day and 0.65/spl plusmn/0.31 degC cooler than the bulk temperature at night. The smaller skin effect during the day was attributed to solar heating. The mean and standard deviation of the percent differences between the vicarious (predicted) at-sensor radiance convolved to the MTI bandpasses and the MTI measured radiances were -1.38/spl plusmn/2.32, -2.46/spl plusmn/1.96, -0.04/spl plusmn/0.78, -1.97/spl plusmn/0.62, -1.59/spl plusmn/0.55 for bands J-N, respectively. The results indicate that, with the exception of band L, the instrument measured radiances are warmer than expected.	advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer;convolution;frequency response;image sensor;metric;maxima and minima;moving target indication;multispectral image;nv network;relative change and difference	Simon J.

In this work, the results of above-ground biomass (AGB) estimates from Landsat Thematic Mapper 5 (TM) images and field data from the fragmented landscape of the upper reaches of the Heihe River Basin (HRB), located in the Qilian Mountains of Gansu province in northwest China, are presented. An optimized k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) method was determined by varying both the mathematical formulation of the algorithm and remote sensing data input which resulted in 3,000 different model configurations. Following the sun-canopy-sensor plus C (SCS+C) topographic correction, performance of the optimized k-NN method was satisfied (R2=0.59, RMSE=24.92 ton/ha) which indicated that the optimized k-NN is capable of operational applications of forest AGB estimates in regions where only a few inventory data are available. Afterwards, the calibrated BIOME-BGC was applied to simulate the carbon fluxes over QMs forests with satisfactory accuracy. Finally, the dynamic analysis and modeling of forest AGB was conducted based on the remotely sensed estimation of forest AGB and the annual forest AGB increment from the ecological process model.	global change;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;mapper;motorola canopy;process modeling;simulation;tales of symphonia;topography	Xin Tian;Zengyuan Li;Yun Guo;Min Yan;Erxue Chen;Zhongbo Su;Christiaan van der Tol;Feilong Ling	2014	2014 IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2014.6946527	soil science;remote sensing	Embedded	84.9935290490846	-57.51781015321286	130122

Daily meteorological data (i.e., temperature and precipitation) and frequent observations of the snowpack were used with the Snowmelt Runoff Model (SRM) to simulate the daily discharge of the Ohau, Pukaki, and Tekapo catchments. The results obtained over these seven years brought considerable improvements in terms of modelling performances compared to previous efforts conducted in the region. It shed new light about the relative contribution of snowmelt to the discharge. The simulations also suggest that the severe drought of 2005 was largely mitigated by ice melt from glaciers in the Pukaki basin. A contribution of glacier melt much larger than normal is believed to have sustained the discharge to within 17% of the mean annual flow, although the precipitation was reduced by 34%.	discharger;performance;simulation;typset and runoff	Pascal Sirguey;Renaud Mathieu;Yves Arnaud;Blair Fitzharris	2009	2009 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2009.5418232	meteorology;snow;geomorphology;glaciology;temperature;hydrology;climatology;earth;physics;rmon	Arch	83.67923641787851	-56.93924663395497	130142

Water is a scarce resource in the semi-arid environments, including South Africa. In South Africa, several studies have quantified evapotranspiration (ET) in different ecosystems at a local scale. Accurate spatially explicit information on ET is rare in the country mainly due to lack of appropriate tools. In recent years, a remote sensing ET product from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MOD16) has been developed. However, its accuracy is not known in South African ecosystems. The objective of this study was to validate the MOD16 ET product using data from two eddy covariance flux towers, namely; Skukuza and Malopeni installed in a savanna and woodland ecosystem within the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Eight day cumulative ET data from the flux towers was calculated to coincide with the eight day MOD16 products over a period of 10 years from 2000 to 2010. The Skukuza flux tower results showed inconsistent comparisons with MOD16 ET. The Malopeni site achieved a poorer comparison with MOD16 ET compared to the Skukuza, and due to a shorter measurement period, data validation was performed for 2009 only. The inconsistent comparison of MOD16 and flux tower-based ET can be attributed to, among other things, the parameterization of the Penman-Monteith model, flux tower measurement errors, and flux tower footprint vs. OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2014, 6 7407 MODIS pixel. MOD16 is important for global inference of ET, but for use in South Africa’s integrated water management, a locally parameterized and improved product should be developed.	data validation;ecosystem;flux limiter;pixel;semiconductor industry;true quantified boolean formula	Abel Ramoelo;Nobuhle Majozi;Renaud Mathieu;Nebo Jovanovic;Alecia Nickless;Sebinasi Dzikiti	2014	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs6087406	evapotranspiration;meteorology;penman–monteith equation;hydrology;ecology;remote sensing;eddy covariance	AI	84.53000804277066	-57.617643017557874	130206

The global MODIS NPP dataset using the MOD17 algorithm provides valuable information for monitoring NPP at 1-km resolution. Since coarse-resolution global climate data are used, the global dataset may contain uncertainties for Europe. We used a 1-km daily gridded European climate data set with the MOD17 algorithm to create the regional NPP dataset MODIS EURO. For evaluation of this new dataset, we compare MODIS EURO with terrestrial driven NPP from analyzing and harmonizing forest inventory data (NFI) from 196,434 plots in 12 European countries as well as the global MODIS NPP dataset for the years 2000 to 2012. Comparing these three NPP datasets, we found that the global MODIS NPP dataset differs from NFI NPP by 26%, while MODIS EURO only differs by 7%. MODIS EURO also agrees with NFI NPP across scales (from continental, regional to country) and gradients (elevation, location, tree age, dominant species, etc.). The agreement is particularly good for elevation, dominant Remote Sens. 2016, 8, 554; doi:10.3390/rs8070554 www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing Remote Sens. 2016, 8, 554 2 of 18 species or tree height. This suggests that using improved climate data allows the MOD17 algorithm to provide realistic NPP estimates for Europe. Local discrepancies between MODIS EURO and NFI NPP can be related to differences in stand density due to forest management and the national carbon estimation methods. With this study, we provide a consistent, temporally continuous and spatially explicit productivity dataset for the years 2000 to 2012 on a 1-km resolution, which can be used to assess climate change impacts on ecosystems or the potential biomass supply of the European forests for an increasing bio-based economy.

9191f34c256b2c1ca31962c13902498dd7ebd6d5	usability of time-lapse digital camera images to detect characteristics of tree phenology in a tropical rainforest		We evaluated the usability of the red (R), green (G), and blue (B) digital numbers (DNRGB) extracted from daily phenological images of a tropical rainforest in Malaysian Borneo. We examined temporal patterns in the proportions of DNR, DNG, and DNB as percentages of total DN (denoted as %R, %G and %B), in the hue, saturation, and lightness values in the HSL color model, and in a green excess index (GEI) of the whole canopy and of individual trees for 2 years. We also examined temporal patterns in the proportions of the red, green, and blue reflectance of the whole canopy surface as percentages of total reflectance (denoted as %ref_R, %ref_G, and %ref_B), and vegetation indices (the normalized-difference vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index, and green–red vegetation index) of the whole canopy by using daily measurements from quantum sensors. The temporal patterns of %RGB and saturation of individual trees revealed the characteristics of tree phenology caused by flowering, coloring, and leaf flushing. In contrast, those of the whole canopy did not, nor did those of %ref_R, %ref_G, or %ref_B, or the vegetation indices. The temporal patterns of GEI, however, could detect differences among individual trees caused by leaf flushing and coloring. Our results show the importance of installing multiple time-lapse digital cameras in tropical rainforests to accurately evaluate the sensitivity of tree phenology to meteorological and climatic changes. However, more work needs to be done to adequately describe whole-canopy changes.	digital camera;usability	Shin Nagai;Tomoaki Ichie;Aogu Yoneyama;Hideki Kobayashi;Tomoharu Inoue;Reiichiro Ishii;Rikie Suzuki;Takao Itioka	2016	Ecological Informatics	10.1016/j.ecoinf.2016.01.006	ecology	HCI	84.37046762490183	-56.37493335514115	130401

Besides that, seasonal analyses are also taken. In this session, a whole year is divided into dry season and rainy season. In spatial analyses, the paper emphasizes on the difference between NO2 column density over the land and the sea located in study area. In addition, some comparative analyses are carried out on monthly average data of NO2 column density and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, in order to explore the relationship between the 2 factors and influence of NO2 in global carbon cycling, as a part of research on global change. The research result shows that: (1) From 1996 to 2009, the NO2 column density over Yangtze Delta Region increases, with some fluctuation. (2) The value of NO2 column density has a higher value in the beginning and the end of the year, while it gets lower in the middle of a year. The value that in dry season is apparently higher than that in rainy season. (3)The spatial analyses show that the column density over land is higher than that over sea on average. Though changing consistently, temporal change of column density over land has a little lag behind that over the sea. (4) The spatial distribution pattern of the value in study area is relatively stable. The place in city of Nanjing, almost all of southern part of Jiangsu Province and Shanghai has a high value, and the place with a low value is in southern part of Zhejiang Province and open sea area to the east of Zhejiang Province. The value in other part of study area is moderate. (5) The variation trend of NO2 column density and Chl-a concentration is almost opposite. Also, it can be proved that there is no linear relationship between the two parameters.	carbon cycle;global change;in the beginning... was the command line;quantum fluctuation;spatial analysis	Yu Zhang;Hong Jiang;Xiuying Zhang	2010	2010 18th International Conference on Geoinformatics	10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2010.5567522	meteorology;geography;hydrology;climatology	EDA	83.66853541190898	-56.58597036794346	130406

Previous research has demonstrated the ability to determine SWE from the propagation and reflection of acoustic waves. Despite the advantages of the acoustic technique, it has not been adapted so that SWE can be determined in an automated fashion. This paper presents a new technique for determining SWE by the application of acoustics. A maximum-length sequence was used as the input to the layered snowpack system. Signal processing of the reflected wave and a recursive algorithm was used to model the sound pressure wave as it passed through the snowpack. Embedded systems were designed to implement the signal processing and calculations so that SWE could be quickly determined at a field location. The systems were deployed at sites near Whitehorse, YT, and at sites in the Rocky Mountains of Alberta, Canada. Comparisons were made between SWE estimated by the acoustic technique and SWE determined by gravimetric sampling. These comparisons demonstrated that the acoustic SWE measurement performed with the embedded systems and the new signal processing technique can provide SWE estimates that are of comparable accuracy to SWE calculated from gravimetric samples.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;embedded system;maximum length sequence;recursion (computer science);reflectometry;sampling (signal processing);signal processing;snow;software propagation	Nicholas J.

The present study explores the capability of remote-sensing variables (vegetation indices and textures derived from SPOT5; backscattering coefficient and interferometric coherence of ALOS PALSAR images) for modeling the spatial distribution of above-ground biomass in the Environmental Conservation Zone of Mexico City. Correlation and spatial autocorrelation coefficients were used to select significant explanatory variables in fir and pine forests. The correlation for interferometric coherence in HV polarization was negative, with patial autocorrelation egression-kriging oniferous forest exico correlations coefficients r = −0.83 for the fir and r = −0.75 for the pine forests. Regression-kriging showed the least root mean square error among the spatial interpolation methods used, with 37.75 tC/ha for fir forests and 29.15 tC/ha for pine forests. The results showed that a hybrid geospatial method, based on interferometric coherence data and a regression-kriging interpolator, has good potential for estimating above-ground biomass carbon. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Differences in reflectance among land-cover and/or plant functional types are obscured by sub-pixel mixing, and so phenological analyses have typically sought to maximize the compositional purity of input satellite data by increasing spatial resolution. We present an alternative method to mitigate this ‘mixed-pixel problem’ and extract the phenological behavior of individual land-cover types inferentially, by inverting the linear mixture model traditionally used for sub-pixel land-cover mapping. Parameterized using genetic algorithms, the method takes advantage of the discriminating capacity of calibrated surface reflectance measurements in red, near infrared, and short-wave infrared wavelengths, as well as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Difference Water Index.

The Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) onboard Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) collected many SAR images since it was launched on 24 January 2006. The combination of ALOS/PALSAR interferometric data and ASTER GDEM should provide the penetration depth of SAR data assuming ASTER GDEM was the elevation of vegetation canopy top. It would be correlated with forest biomass because penetration depth could be affected by forest density and forest canopy height. Their combination held great promises for the forest biomass mapping over large area. The feasibility of forest biomass mapping through the data synthesis of ALOS/PALSAR InSAR data and ASTER GDEM was investigated in this study. A procedure for the extraction of penetration depth was firstly proposed. Then three models were built for biomass estimation: (I) model only using backscattering coefficients of ALOS/PALSAR data; (II) model only using penetration depth; (III) model using both of them. The biomass estimated from Lidar data was taken as reference data to evaluate the three different models. The results showed that the combination of OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2014, 6 7304 backscattering coefficients and penetration depth gave the best accuracy. The forest disturbance has to be considered in forest biomass estimation because of the long time span of ASTER data for generating ASTER GDEM. The spatial homogeneity could be used to improve estimation accuracy.	advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer;algorithm;aperture (software);carbon cycle;coefficient;decorrelation;digital elevation model;digital geometry;l band;motorola canopy;phased array;sampling (signal processing);spatial reference system;synthetic data;the forest;zhi-li zhang	Wenjian Ni;Zhiyu Zhang;Guoqing Sun;Zhifeng Guo;Yating He	2014	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs6087303	penetration depth;hydrology;interferometric synthetic aperture radar;physics;photogrammetry;remote sensing	Robotics	83.52398189009467	-61.04872581507429	131404
081a884c15def385bd789321d69d3eccc477934f	erosion associated with seismically-induced landslides in the middle longmen shan region, eastern tibetan plateau, china		The 2008 Wenchuan earthquake and associated co-seismic landslide was the most recent expression of the rapid deformation and erosion occurring in the eastern Tibetan Plateau. The erosion associated with co-seismic landslides balances the long-term tectonic uplift in the topographic evolution of the region; however, the quantitative relationship between earthquakes, uplift, and erosion is still unknown. In order to quantitatively distinguish the seismically-induced erosion in the total erosion, here, we quantify the Wenchuan earthquake-induced erosion using the digital elevation model (DEM) differential method and previously-reported landslide volumes. Our results show that the seismically-induced erosion is comparable with the pre-earthquake short-term erosion. The seismically-induced erosion rate contributes ~50% of the total erosion rate, which suggests that the local topographic evolution of the middle Longmen Shan region may be closely related to tectonic events, such as the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. We propose that seismically-induced erosion is a very important component of the total erosion, particularly in active orogenic regions. Our results demonstrate that the remote sensing technique of differential DEM provides a powerful tool for evaluating the volume of co-seismic landslides produced in intermountain regions by strong earthquakes.	digital elevation model;erosion (morphology);noise shaping;topography	Zhikun Ren;Zhuqi Zhang;Jinhui Yin	2017	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs9080864	geology;tectonic uplift;geomorphology;erosion;tectonics;china;landslide;topographic map;seismology;digital elevation model;plateau	EDA	83.33650945365238	-56.115649575238244	131707
670ed37b1b643be407e04f9eb7d1a0cb9ec7bc46	estimating temporal changes in soil ph in the black soil region of northeast china using remote sensing		Abstract Soil pH is a dominant soil variable because it influences many physical, chemical, and biological soil properties and plant growth processes. This study aimed at identifying the potential for field hyperspectral reflectance, multispectral satellite imagery and environmental variables to predict soil pH changes for croplands in regional areas located in the black soil region of Dehui in Northeast China. First, hyperspectral reflectance was acquired from a small area of Dehui; then, Landsat images with a 30 m resolution were acquired on 10 Oct 2005 and 22 Oct 2016 for the whole study region. This showed the scope for estimating soil pH with remote sensing derived variables both at the field scale and the regional scale for croplands in black soil regions. We selected 18 spectral variables from hyperspectral reflectance, 17 spectral variables from multispectral imagery and 6 environmental variables, respectively, and found relationships between the controlling variables and the measured soil pH values. Subsequently, 7 spectral indicators from hyperspectral reflectance, 7 spectral indicators from multispectral reflectance and 3 environmental indicators had higher correlations with soil pH among those variables. Finally, we used the partial least squares regression (PLSR) model to build soil pH prediction models for the 7 spectral indicators from hyperspectral reflectance and for the 7 spectral indicators from Landsat image with 3 environmental indicators, then we combined the two models to obtain a soil pH prediction model at the regional scale. The results showed that several thermal reflectance, vegetation indices and environmental variables, including the ratio vegetation index (RVI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the normalized difference water index (NDWI), land use, mean annual precipitation and mean annual temperature were strong predictors of soil pH distribution at the regional scale. The combined soil pH prediction model had an R 2 of 0.50, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.30 and a residual prediction deviation (RPD) of 1.55, indicating reliable precision and average prediction abilities. We estimated that soil pH values showed obvious heterogeneity over the study region, and soil pH mainly changed with crop type.

The random function describing the surface is expanded in a Fourier series. The scattering from the RRS light field is approximated as a field, obtained as result of diffraction from sinusoidal gratings. The mixed field (obtained from the mixing of the diffracted field and the field of the laser beam) carries information about the phase of each sinusoidal grating. Sections of the diffracted and mixing fields are correspondingly registered by photodiode array. The first, the second and the third diffraction orders from each grating are taken into account for the surface reconstruction. The statistical distribution and the autocorrelation function of the surface height fluctuation are calculated. The surface parameters of mean roughness, root mean square and correlation length are determined. The studied surface, having a Gaussian statistic, is measured from the work of Daintyet al.Talystep profilometer. The values of the above-mentioned surface parameters calculated in Daintyet al.are in good agreement with those obtained in the present work.	holography	Marina Burova;Julian Burov	1998	Real-Time Imaging	10.1006/rtim.1997.0085	probability distribution;root mean square;surface reconstruction;autocorrelation;light field;statistical parameter;random function;fourier series;statistics	Vision	84.82597493857769	-66.74901688853122	132396

65f7d130c8470fc889f376b25cb59312640e6ded	oversights in hindsight: reflections from a rambling biogeographer		As an instructor in GIS applications at a tertiary institution I can think of no better way to use my editorial privilege than to discuss some of the obvious pitfalls awaiting enthusiasts embarking on their first research project. One of the most rewarding tasks in my research career was gathering and analysing data from Nullica State Forest, a eucalypt-dominated forest in New South Wales, Australia. The analysis within a GIS environment was important because of the issues relating to logging and the concern of environmentalists and the general public. The fieldwork was an idyllic journey in itself. If one started a bush walk on a ridge it would be common to find largely dry sclerophyll communities dominated by silver top ash reaching up to 30 or 35 metres in height gloved by thick, dark brown furrowed bark on lower trunks with smooth creamy coloured upper limbs. Descending from the ridge down slope, often via precipitous inclines, you would probably pass through a variety of stringybarks such as the distinctive yellow stringybark, taller than silver top ash with a canopy of glossy green leaves. In the valleys the understorey becomes more dense and the variety of species of eucalypts becomes richer, including peppermints and sometimes the majestic grey Maiden's gum, reaching up to 50 metres. It was possible to find sections of this forest that could be true wilderness. The depths of our tall timber country invokes respect for its monumental grandeur and variability and a desire to understand its geography. This guest editorial allows me the opportunity to reflect on this study and the use of GIS (and like technologies or tools) to help us in understanding such a complex entity as a eucalypt forest. One of my initial aims was to develop an understanding of where certain species of eucalypts were most likely to occur across the spatial expanse of the forest in terms of several sets of environmental variables. This involved gathering field data selected using a stratified (based on a GIS geology coverage) random sampling procedure. During a number of field trips, seeing the forest in the blazing heat of summer and experiencing a fall of snow in winter, 309 plots were collected and nine transects of varying length were walked. These were combined with data available from a previous study to create a set of roughly 400 sampled quadrats of eucalypt data of individual species counts. Does this constitute an impressive field data set? It may seem so to the average GIS analyst. However, given that there are at least 18 species of eucalypt growing in Nullica, this was barely adequate. These data were entered into a GIS and Transactions in GIS, 2001, 5(3): 189±192	amiga reflections;field research;gis applications;geographic information system;monte carlo method;motorola canopy;sampling (signal processing);server log;spatial variability;the forest	Julie Delaney	2001	Trans.

These ecosystems exist across a wide temperature gradient from the Arctic regions to the Equator, but are confined to a narrow set of moisture conditions that range from arid deserts to forest-dominated systems. Primary productivity in OGFD ecosystems appears extremely sensitive to environmental change. We compared global trends in the annual maximum and mean values of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and identified the key bioclimatic indices that controlled OGFD productivity changes in various regions for the period from 1982 to 2011. We found significantly increased or decreased annual maximum NDVI values of 36.3% and 4.6% for OGFD ecosystems, respectively. Trends in the annual mean NDVI are similar for most OGFD ecosystems and show greater area decreases and smaller area increases than trends in the annual maximum NDVI in global OGFD ecosystems during the study period. Ecosystems in which the productivity significantly increased were distributed mainly in the Arctic, mid-eastern South America, central Africa, central Eurasia and Oceania, while those with decreasing trends in productivity were mainly on the Mongolian Plateau. Temperature increases tended to improve productivity in colder OGFD ecosystems; and precipitation is positively correlated with productivity changes in grassland and savannas, but negatively correlated with changes in the Arctic tundra. Simple bioclimatic indices explain 42% to 55% of productivity changes in OGFD systems worldwide, and the main climatic predictors of productivity differed significantly between regions. In light of future climate change, the findings of this study will help support management of global OGFD ecosystems.	arid;ecosystem;gradient;habitat	Qingzhu Gao;Mark W.

99704a1ee00bf2d3dc18ab5bd2dd7ad0fa762d77	estimation of penetration depth from soil effective temperature in microwave radiometry		Soil moisture is an essential variable in Earth surface modeling. Two dedicated satellite missions, the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), are currently in operation to map the global distribution of soil moisture. However, at the longer L-band wavelength of these satellites, the emitting behavior of the land becomes very complex due to the unknown deeper penetration depth. This complexity leads to more uncertainty in calibration and validation of satellite soil moisture product and their applications. In the framework of zeroth-order incoherent microwave radiative transfer model, the soil effective temperature is the only component that contains depth information and thus provides the necessary link to quantify the penetration depth. By means of the multi-layer soil effective temperature (Lv’s Te f f ) scheme, we have determined the relationship between the penetration depth and soil effective temperature and verified it against field observations at the Maqu Network. The key findings are that the penetration depth can be estimated according to Lv’s Te f f scheme with the assumption of linear soil temperature gradient along the optical depth; and conversely, the soil temperature at the penetration depth should be equal to the soil effective temperature with the same linear assumption. The accuracy of this inference depends on to what extent the assumption of linear soil temperature gradient is satisfied. The result of this study is expected to advance understanding of the soil moisture products retrieved by SMOS and SMAP and improve the techniques in data assimilation and climate research.	data assimilation;gradient;l band;layer (electronics);microwave;penetration test	Shaoning Lv;Yijian Zeng;Jun Wen;Hong Zhao;Zhongbo Su	2018	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs10040519	atmospheric radiative transfer codes;atmospheric sciences;geology;remote sensing;optical depth;salinity;data assimilation;effective temperature;water content;temperature gradient;penetration depth	Robotics	84.55646708971098	-63.31668826705775	133636
da3f10a9fedb81d9abcbee611948f94100d09d10	thermal transmission through existing building enclosures: destructive monitoring in intermediate layers versus non-destructive monitoring with sensors on surfaces	raspberry pi;annual energy demand;building monitoring;data correction algorithm;interior comfort;thermal inertia;thermal transmittance	Opaque enclosures of buildings play an essential role in the level of comfort experienced indoors and annual energy demand. The impact of solar radiation and thermal inertia of the materials that make up the multi-layer enclosures substantially modify thermal transmittance behaviour of the enclosures. This dynamic form of heat transfer, additionally affected by indoor HVAC systems, has a substantial effect on the parameters that define comfort. It also has an impact on energy demand within a daily cycle as well as throughout a one-year use cycle. This study describes the destructive monitoring of an existing block of flats located in Alicante. Once the enclosure was opened, sensors of temperature (PT100), air velocity, and relative humidity were located in the different layers of the enclosure, as well as in the interior and exterior surfaces. A pyranometer was also installed to measure solar radiation levels. A temperature data correction algorithm was drawn up to address irregularities produced in the enclosure. The algorithm was applied using a Raspberry Pi processor in the data collection system. The comparative results of temperature gradients versus non-destructive monitoring systems are presented, providing measures of the transmittance value, surface temperatures and indoor and outdoor air temperatures. This remote sensing system can be used in future studies to quantify and compare the energy savings of different enclosure construction solutions.	data collection;enclosure device component;futures studies;gradient;humidity;layer (electronics);numerous;raspberry pi 3 model b (latest version);solar energy;velocity (software development);algorithm;anatomical layer;sensor (device)	Víctor Echarri;Almudena Espinosa;Carlos Rizo	2017		10.3390/s17122848	electronic engineering;heat transfer;pi;engineering;hvac;radiation;thermal transmittance;transmittance;enclosure;pyranometer	HCI	84.70949498528259	-52.312840097730074	133821
a6190f75fec1476bc13bb1e0f6d48e991a766314	evaluating precipitation estimates from eta, trmm and chrips data in the south-southeast region of minas gerais state - brazil		Precipitation estimates derived from the Eta model and from TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) and CHIRPS (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data) remotely sensed data were compared to the precipitation data of the INMET (National Institute of Meteorology) meteorological stations in the south-southeast region of Minas Gerais state, Brazil, in the period between July 2009 and June 2015. Then, information about evapotranspiration (ETR), water deficit (DEF), and water surplus (EXC) was obtained from the precipitation data, using the sequential water balance (SWB) separately for each type of precipitation data (INMET, TRMM, Eta, and CHIRPS). Subsequently, the components of the SWB were comparatively analyzed. The results indicate that all three products overestimate rainfall. The strongest relationships between the INMET data and the estimated data were observed for the TRMM, in terms of precipitation estimates, as well as DEF, EXC, and ETR components. The Eta precipitation estimates are overestimated relative to those from INMET, resulting in underestimation of the water deficit (DEFETA) and overestimation of evapotranspiration (ETRETA). In general, the CHIRPS data presented a pattern similar to the station data, though statistical analyses were lower than those of the TRMM data.	angular defect;chirp;coefficient;computer simulation;detailed balance;eta systems;meteorological reanalysis	Sulimar Munira Caparoci Nogueira;Mauricio Alves Moreira;Margarete Marin Lordelo Volpato	2018	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs10020313		ML	85.01857183734143	-58.523551602499566	133853

Since 2000, a broad-scale 50 km SST was used to monitor thermal stress for coral reefs globally. However, some discrepancies were noted when applied to small-scale fringing coral reefs. To address this, CRW created a new DSS, specifically targeted at or near reef scales. Here, we evaluated the new reef-scale (5 km resolution) products using in situ temperature data and coral bleaching surveys which were also compared with the heritage broad-scale (50 km) for three reefs (Buccoo Reef, Culloden and Speyside) of the southern Caribbean island of Tobago. Seasonal and annual biases indicated the new 5 km SST generally represents the conditions at these reefs more accurately and more consistently than the 50 km SST. Consistency between satellite and in situ temperature data influences the performance of anomaly-based predictions of bleaching: the 5 km DHW product showed better consistency with bleaching observations than the 50 km product. These results are the first to demonstrate the improvement of the 5 km products over the 50 km predecessors and support their use in monitoring thermal stress of reefs in the southern Caribbean.	anomaly detection;coral 66;decision support system;performance evaluation;real-time clock;real-time computing	Shaazia S.

Following common practice in data assimilation schemes, most diagnostic tools and metrics for intercomparison of reanalyses, correct a climate model forecast (hincast) or background field of continuous variables based on optimal minimization of the model variable with respect to observed values, summed over some or all grid points in a discretization. Evaluated properly, this procedure allows for effective utilization of innovation, increments, and residuals to improve parameterizations and physical understanding. The least squares difference is often used as a basic measure of accuracy that is then normalized to form an agreement index/metric and to quantify the correction needed. These metrics are most appropriate for continuous fields where the observed and model variables are commensurate (i.e., measured with the same units). They are, however, flawed when used in the presence of sharp gradients and discontinuities and when used to evaluate a model's success in predicting or reproducing smaller scale lower dimensional features contained within a bulk simulation. These features, occur frequently in geophysical climate applications and often represent discontinuities that are associated with important climate physical and dynamic processes.	climate model;data assimilation;discretization;fuzzy concept;gradient;least squares;simulation	Gad Levy	2015	2015 Annual Conference of the North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society (NAFIPS) held jointly with 2015 5th World Conference on Soft Computing (WConSC)	10.1109/NAFIPS-WConSC.2015.7284120	data modeling;atmospheric model;econometrics;mathematical optimization;computer science;predictive modelling;statistics	SE	86.77375263068929	-61.90248933653356	134158

Landsat imagery was used to develop a detailed forest cover map, while the PALSAR data were used to estimate the volume information. The volume was converted to tree age information for each of the three forest types in Japan. An estimation of CO2 sequestration values for each forest type and for each tree age from the forest inventory data was made. The forest cover map results in four classes, and the overall accuracy yields approximately 74%. For the volume estimation, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was computed with the ground reference information resulting in 105.58 m/ha. The final result showed that total CO2 sequestration in Japan based on tree age forest subclasses yields 85.0 Mt∙CO2 (coniferous), 4.76 Mt∙CO2 (evergreen broadleaf) and 21.61 Mt∙CO2 (deciduous broadleaf), which in total is 111.27 Mt∙CO2. Using remote sensing techniques to quantitatively estimate CO2 sequestration in Japanese forests has been shown both to have advantages and to offer further possibilities.

Phase synchronization of the sunspot cycle and a fast component of the SIM have been found and confirmed with statistical significance in three epochs (1727–1757, 1802–1832 and 1863–1922) of the entire 1700–1997 record.

Over the 20th century the increase was greater than 0.6°C. The rate of change for the period since 1976 is roughly three times that for the past 100 years as a whole. Analyses of proxy data for the Northern Hemisphere indicate that late 20th century warmth is unprecedented for at least the past millennium. In the Northern Hemisphere, the 1990s were the warmest decade and 1998 the warmest year in the past 1000 years. Land Surface Temperature (LST) plays an important role in the cycle of the natural ecosystem evolution and can be used as an indicator to quantify changes in the physical characteristics of land cover. LST retrieval from satellite data is mainly influenced by the atmosphere and surface emissivity. If both effects are not corrected for the error in LST may be very large (up to 12 K). In order to obtain accurate estimations of LST, an operative Split-Window (SW) algorithm with an error of estimation of 1.3 K is presented. This SW algorithm does not need any external data than those provided by satellite. Before applying the operative SW algorithm to satellite images, an evaluation study has been previously carried out in which the algorithm was compared to other algorithms existing in the bibliography. The Pathfinder AVHRR Land (PAL) data has been used for the application of the operative SW algorithm. The PAL data corresponds to all the months of 1998. The Korean Peninsula was selected as the area of study due to its high environmental diversity. Korea is located in the temperate zone, with four distinct seasons (spring, summer, autumn and winter). Due to the Korean Peninsula's long north-south stretch and topographic complexity, there are wide variations in temperature and rainfall. The mean temperature throughout the four seasons ranges from 5oC to 16oC and rainfall from 500 to 1500 millimeters.	algorithm;ecosystem;pal;pac-land;proxy server;shattered world;topography	Asaad Chahboun;Naoufal Raissouni;José A.

e9108fb4d2360a587696359aca0a9a2e0d1fde00	the benjamin-feir instability and propagation of swell across the pacific	ocean swell;nonlinear waves;benjamin feir instability	About 40 years ago, Snodgrass and other oceanographers (1966) tracked ocean swell propagating across the entire Pacific Ocean. At about the same time, several investigators (including Benjamin and Feir) showed that a uniform train of plane waves of finite amplitude on deep water is unstable. Comparing these two results, each of which is highly cited, leads to the following question: in light of this instability, how did the waves tracked by oceanographers travel coherently more than 10,000 km across the Pacific Ocean? A possible explanation is provided in recent work that re-examined the Benjamin–Feir instability in the presence of linear damping. The conclusion was that even small amounts of damping can stabilize the instability before nonlinear effects become important. In addition, the theoretical predictions agree well with results from laboratory experiments. In this paper we re-examine ocean data from 1966 to estimate whether the oceanic damping that was measured could have controlled the Benjamin–Feir instability for the swell that was tracked. We find that for one set of ocean swell, dissipation controls the Benjamin–Feir instability enough to allow coherent wave propagation across the Pacific. For a second set of ocean swell, it does not. For a third set of ocean swell, an integral that the theory predicts to be constant is not constant in the data; it decreases and correspondingly the spectral peak shifts to a lower frequency—this is frequency downshifting. For this case the theory is not an adequate model, so the corresponding Benjamin–Feir analysis can be misleading. Thus, our results from the historical records are inconclusive: we can assert neither that dissipation of ocean swell is always negligible, nor that it is always important. But our results show that dissipation can control the Benjamin–Feir instability for small-amplitude waves and that downshifting occurs in ocean swell with relatively small wave slopes. © 2010 IMACS.

It has also been shown that use of the small perturbation method for calculation of surface emissivity results in a series in surface slope, not surface height, so that the method remains accurate for large height surface emission even when it fails for the corresponding scattering calculations. This paper presents a detailed analysis of the SPM/small slope approximation (SPM/SSA) for ocean surface polarimetric thermal emission, and investigates the extent to which varying ocean surface length scales contribute to brightness temperature zeroth and second azimuthal harmonics. It is found that ocean waves of lengths both comparable to and much greater than the electromagnetic wavelength can contribute to these harmonics, depending on the extent to which the ocean surface spectral model places asymmetry in these length scales. In addition, the SPM/SSA is approximated for the contributions of both very long and very short ocean length scales compared to the electromagnetic wavelength, and it is found that both long and short wave contributions can be expressed in simple equations involving either standard or modified ocean surface slope variances.	approximation;polarimetry	Joel T.

8eb3ccc9ad1e5a93f3dbba6742f651ad8c12e0a3	atmospheric correction of hyperspectral gcas airborne measurements over the north atlantic ocean and louisiana shelf		"""The Geostationary Coastal and Air Pollution Events Airborne Simulator (GCAS) instrument has been used as a precursor for a hyperspectral instrument on the future geostationary satellite, yet its ability to “measure” ocean reflectance needs to be evaluated. Here, we demonstrate its capacity through vicarious calibration and atmospheric correction of data collected during flight campaigns over the Louisiana shelf in September 2013 and over the North Atlantic Ocean in November 2015. GCAS-measured at-sensor radiance was first vicariously calibrated using concurrent measurements by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) and radiative transfer simulations with the MODerate resolution atmospheric TRANsmission (MODTRAN). Then, atmospheric correction has been implemented using MODTRAN-developed lookup tables and the traditional Gordon and Wang “black pixel” approach but with nonzero water-leaving radiance in the near-infrared accounted for through iteration.

A surface-based C-band polarimetric data set collected in February 2006 is used to contrast the polarimetric response to sampled conditions of bare frozen ground, cold snow-covered ground, and snow during a Chinook event. Chinook activity is inherently spatially and temporally variable across the region in winter and produces considerable spatial variability of snow-cover physical properties associated with snow-water-equivalent (SWE) estimates. A temporal analysis of polarimetric backscatter sensed during a Chinook-induced ablation event on February 27, 2006 is used to describe the associated changes in snow conditions and scattering mechanisms. Analysis reveals that the polarimetric surface-based C-band scatterometer data respond to changes in snow parameters associated with the specific ground and snow conditions and to the temporal Chinook ablation event. Use of the copolarizations, cross-polarization, depolarization ratio, copolarization ratio, complex copolarization correlation coefficient, and the copolarized phase difference information show promise in describing changes in snow physical parameters, differing ground and snow conditions, and transitional ablation events, based on differing scattering mechanisms. This paper infers that an increase in volume scattering and fluctuations in surface scattering during the Chinook ablation event may be associated with specific physical changes such as density, crystal structure, and permittivity caused by wind speed. This paper has implications for remotely sensed estimations of snow-covered area (SCA) and SWE. Association of SCA and SWE with backscatter coefficients is not explicit in this paper; however, changes in SWE and snow properties are inferentially linked to changes in backscatter.	backscatter (email);chinook (draughts player);coefficient;crystal structure;microwave;polarimetry;polarization (waves);snow;spatial variability	Mark Christopher Fuller;Torsten Geldsetzer;John J.

Reflectance spectra were collected every week for three weeks using an ASD FieldSpec Pro spectroradiometer with both a contact probe (CP) and a field of view probe (FOV) for plants treated twice weekly in a laboratory setting with 0 mM (control) or 15 mM of lithium chloride (LiCl) solution. Plants were harvested each week after spectra collection for determination of relevant physical endpoints such as relative water content and chlorophyll content. Mixed effects analyses were conducted on selected endpoints and vegetation indices (VI) to determine the significance of the effects of treatment level and length of treatment as well as to determine which VI would be appropriate predictors of treatment-dependent endpoints. Of the species considered, A. thaliana exhibited the most significant effects and corresponding shifts in reflectance spectra. Depending on the species and endpoint, the most relevant VIs in this study were NDVI, PSND, YI, R1676/R1933, R750/R550, and R950/R750.	appendix;argentine canola pollen extract;brassica napus;british national vegetation classification;cerebral palsy;chloride ion;chlorophyll;communication endpoint;erythrocyte indices;helianthus annuus;lithium chloride;parf-1 protein, arabidopsis;visual instruction set;zea mays;corn pollen extract 50 mg/ml injectable solution	Nicole E Martinez;Julia L.

SMAP will make global measurements of the soil moisture present at the Earth's land surface and will distinguish frozen from thawed land surfaces. Direct observations of soil moisture and freeze/thaw state from space will allow significantly improved estimates of water, energy, and carbon transfers between the land and the atmosphere. The accuracy of numerical models of the atmosphere used in weather prediction and climate projections are critically dependent on the correct characterization of these transfers. Soil moisture measurements are also directly applicable to flood assessment and drought monitoring. SMAP observations can help monitor these natural hazards, resulting in potentially great economic and social benefits. SMAP observations of soil moisture and freeze/thaw timing will also reduce a major uncertainty in quantifying the global carbon balance by helping to resolve an apparent missing carbon sink on land over the boreal latitudes. The SMAP mission concept will utilize L-band radar and radiometer instruments sharing a rotating 6-m mesh reflector antenna to provide high-resolution and high-accuracy global maps of soil moisture and freeze/thaw state every two to three days. In addition, the SMAP project will use these observations with advanced modeling and data assimilation to provide deeper root-zone soil moisture and net ecosystem exchange of carbon. SMAP is scheduled for launch in the 2014-2015 time frame.	climate model;computer simulation;data assimilation;ecosystem;image resolution;l band;map;radar;reflector (antenna)	Dara Entekhabi;Eni G.

The scattering problem is formulated following a physics-separate strategy. The wave in the air domain is expressed by the scattered field formulation, while the wave in the sea ice domain is expressed by the total field formulation. The two separate physics and formulations are coupled through the boundary conditions at the air-sea ice interface. The proposed FEM is tested for simulating the radar cross section (RCS) of homogeneous sea ice at C and L bands. By comparing the results of the FEM with the Small Perturbation Method (SPM), good agreements are achieved.	computer simulation;cross section (geometry);finite element method;microwave;radar;super paper mario	Xu Xu;Anthony Paul Doulgeris;Frank Melandsø;Camilla Brekke	2016	2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730264	meteorology;geophysics;sea ice emissivity modelling;sea surface temperature;oceanography;geology;finite element method;mathematical model;scattering;sea ice;physics	Robotics	84.11042565057527	-67.36919465026396	136810

In this paper, we linked the land surface model Simplified Simple Biosphere version 3.0 (SSiB3) with the radiative transfer model Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks, and we forced the coupled model with the disaggregated North American Data Assimilation System phase 2 (NLDAS-2) meteorological data to simulate the snow properties and the 36.5-GHz microwave brightness temperature (Tb) at a spatial resolution of 90 m. The modeled SWE and Tb were used to interpret the radiance observed by the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) and to explore the impact of snow spatial variability on the microwave radiance in a mountain environment. The modeling was carried out over the Upper Kern Basin, Sierra Nevada. We developed new methods for modeling the effect of large snowfall events on the snow grain size. We aggregated the modeled radiance to the satellite scale using the AMSR-E 36.5-GHz antenna sampling pattern. The methods were calibrated for water years (WYs) 2004-2006 and validated for WYs 2003, 2007, and 2008. The coefficient governing the grain growth rate was also calibrated. The modeling results showed that the new snow grain estimation scheme reduced the error in the modeled radiance by 55.2% during the calibration period. The Tb root-mean-square error was 3.1 K during the snow accumulation season for the validation period. The modeling results showed that, in the study area, the microwave signal saturated for SWE values between 0.3 and 0.5 m. It was found that the subfootprint-scale SWE variability has a significant impact on the saturation of spaceborne PM observations. The experiments demonstrate that this modeling system improves the accuracy of the radiance modeling, which is critical for estimating the mountain SWE via PM remote sensing either for informing direct retrieval algorithms or for data assimilation. We plan to use the modeling framework in future radiance assimilation studies.	advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer;algorithm;alpine;biosphere;calibration (statistics);coefficient;data assimilation;experiment;land surface model (lsm version 1.0);microwave;sampling (signal processing);simulation;snow;spatial variability;terabyte;tree accumulation	Dongyue Li;Michael Durand;Steven A.

The SST analysis includes a diurnal correction method to estimate foundation SST (SST free from diurnal variability) using satellite sea surface wind and solar radiation data, frequency splitting to reproduce intra-seasonal variability and a quality control procedure repeated twice to avoid operation errors. An optimal interpolation method designed for foundation SST is applied to blend the microwave and infrared satellite measurements. Although in situ SST measurements are not used for bias correction adjustments in the analysis, the output product, with a spatial grid size of 0.1°, has an accuracy of 0.48      ∘    C and 0.46      ∘    C compared to the in situ foundation SST measurements derived by drifting buoys and Argo floats, respectively. The same quality against the two types of in situ foundation SST (drifters and Argo) suggests that the two definitions of foundation SST proposed by past studies can provide same-quality information about the sea surface state underlying the diurnal thermocline.

7ce08fe5045673deb29a93ce2a40cf41ec36802f	radiation transfer calculations and assessment of global warming by co2		We present detailed line-by-line radiation transfer calculations, which were performed under different atmospheric conditions for the most important greenhouse gases water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and ozone. Particularly cloud effects, surface temperature variations, and humidity changes as well as molecular lineshape effects are investigated to examine their specific influence on some basic climatologic parameters like the radiative forcing, the long wave absorptivity, and back-radiation as a function of an increasing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. These calculations are used to assess the CO2 global warming by means of an advanced two-layer climate model and to disclose some larger discrepancies in calculating the climate sensitivity. Including solar and cloud effects as well as all relevant feedback processes our simulations give an equilibrium climate sensitivity of  = 0.7°C (temperature increase at doubled CO2) and a solar sensitivity of  = 0.17°C (at 0.1% increase of the total solar irradiance). Then CO2 contributes 40% and the Sun 60% to global warming over the last century.		Hermann Harde	2017	Adv.

The model simulates two ele- mental cycles (N and P), two phytoplankton groups (cyanobacteria and non-cyanobacteria), and heterotrophic bacteria. First, we examine the capacity to reproduce the observed plankton patterns, while accommodating the uncertainty related to the external forcing factors of our model (hydraulic and nutrient loading, zooplankton grazing). Sensitivity analysis is also performed to identify the most influential parameters and therefore to shed light on the knowledge needed to solidify the model parameter specification. We subsequently utilize the cali- brated model to assess the phytoplankton response to potential restoration actions; namely, the interplay be- tween external nutrient loading reductions and variant flushing rates. The model successfully simulates a number of relevant water quality variables in the system, including total chlorophyll a, nitrate, ammonia, total nitrogen and total phosphorus. According to our sensitivity analysis, the credibility of the model as a manage- ment tool is primarily dependent upon the characterization of the phytoplankton growth strategies and associ- atedsettlingrates.ExternalPandNloadingsareidentifiedasthepredominantdriverof thesystemdynamicsand their control should remain the main priority of local management efforts.

2b71e010738e43f99f75503de6a635adb026dce8	numerical analysis of microwave scattering from layered sea ice based on the finite element method		A two-dimensional scattering model based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) is built for simulating the microwave scattering of sea ice, which is a layered medium. The scattering problem solved by the FEM is formulated following a totaland scattered-field decomposition strategy. The model set-up is first validated with good agreements by comparing the results of the FEM with those of the small perturbation method and the method of moment. Subsequently, the model is applied to two cases of layered sea ice to study the effect of subsurface scattering. The first case is newly formed sea ice which has scattering from both air–ice and ice–water interfaces. It is found that the backscattering has a strong oscillation with the variation of sea ice thickness. The found oscillation effects can increase the difficulty of retrieving the thickness of newly formed sea ice from the backscattering data. The second case is first-year sea ice with C-shaped salinity profiles. The scattering model accounts for the variations in the salinity profile by approximating the profile as consisting of a number of homogeneous layers. It is found that the salinity profile variations have very little influence on the backscattering for both Cand L-bands. The results show that the sea ice can be considered to be homogeneous with a constant salinity value in modelling the backscattering and it is difficult to sense the salinity profile of sea ice from the backscattering data, because the backscattering is insensitive to the salinity profile.	antivirus software;computation;finite element method;frequency band;incidence matrix;interaction;l band;microwave;numerical analysis;simulation;subsurface scattering;super paper mario;thickness (graph theory);time complexity;verification and validation;while	Xu Xu;Camilla Brekke;Anthony Paul Doulgeris;Frank Melandsø	2018	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs10091332	remote sensing;sea ice;backscatter;geology;geophysics;finite element method;scattering;oscillation;sea ice thickness;salinity;subsurface scattering	EDA	83.83000702784001	-66.8658437249231	138632

On the one hand, in the field of remote sensing, leaves were often assumed to be randomly distributed in tree crowns in previous researches. While this assumption is not correct for many forest canopies, especially for coniferous forests because trees have obvious hierarchical characteristics in an individual crown; one the other hand, reconstruction of detailed canopy architecture in a computer using methods of three-dimensional (3-D) architectural simulations is very labor-intensive and time-consuming at present. In this paper, structures within crown were described using simple probability models based on plant growing rules instead of 3-D simulations. Gap fraction (GF) and clumping index (CI) of foliage were calculated at branch level within crown. The results show that: (1) GF and CI are closely related to the number of nwb (the number of branches in a branch whorl): GF decrease and CI increase with increasing of nwb; (2) the assumption that branches or leaves are randomly distributed within crowns is not true, especially for larger value of nwb.	bus bunching;cloud fraction;crown group;fingerprint;grammatical framework;inverted index;motorola canopy;randomness;simulation	Jun Geng;Lili Tu;Qingjiu Tian;Xiaofei Wang;Xiaobo Zhu;Yanjun Yang;Ranran Yang;Lei Wang;Chunguang Lv;Yuchen Fang	2016	2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729333	database index;computer science;solid modeling;computational model;vegetation;remote sensing	Arch	87.53479715920791	-60.87463711413773	138689

Such an SVI requires calibration on a large number of representative vegetation conditions. We developed a two-step approach: (1) estimation of LAI on a subset of satellite data through RTM inversion; and (2) the calibration of a vegetation index on these estimated LAI. We applied this methodology to Eucalyptus plantations which have highly variable LAI in time and space. Previous results showed that an RTM inversion of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) near-infrared and red reflectance allowed good retrieval performance (R = 0.80, RMSE = 0.41), but was computationally difficult. Here, the RTM OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2012, 4 3767 results were used to calibrate a dedicated vegetation index (called “EucVI”) which gave similar LAI retrieval results but in a simpler way. The R of the regression between measured and EucVI-simulated LAI values on a validation dataset was 0.68, and the RMSE was 0.49. The additional use of stand age and day of year in the SVI equation slightly increased the performance of the index (R = 0.77 and RMSE = 0.41). This simple index opens the way to an easily applicable retrieval of Eucalyptus LAI from MODIS data, which could be used in an operational way.	data point;ecosystem;gene expression programming;inversion (discrete mathematics);mean squared error;stellar classification;synthetic data;time series	Guerric le Maire;Claire Marsden;Yann Nouvellon;Jose-Luiz Stape;Flávio Jorge Ponzoni	2012	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs4123766	enhanced vegetation index;forest;normalized difference vegetation index;biomass;hydrology;canopy;atmospheric radiative transfer codes;derivation;remote sensing	ML	84.91591684739532	-60.57856122348019	138723

A classic model used for TV coverage prediction is the Longley-Rice ITM (Irregular Terrain Model). Other well-known multiple knife-edge diffraction models are the Epstein-Peterson, Deygout, and Giovaneli methods. In this paper, comparisons are presented between accurate field-strength measurements, taken by a Rohde & Schwarz FSH-3 portable spectrum analyzer using precision calibrated antennas and calculated results from the Longley-Rice model, and the multiple knife-edge models in conjunction with the 3-arc-second SRTM (Satellite Radar Topography Mission) terrain data. Calculations are limited to the main 2 knife-edges of the propagation path. The Longley-Rice model predicts received field strength accurately in most cases even in mountainous terrain with multiple diffracting obstacles in the VHF and UHF TV Bands. However, in some long distance fringe reception areas field-strength is underestimated by the Longley-Rice model, while it is accurately calculated by the multiple knife-edge diffraction models.	bayesian information criterion;broadcast range;irish transverse mercator;peterson's algorithm;shuttle radar topography mission;software propagation;spectrum analyzer;ultra high frequency	Stylianos Kasampalis;Pavlos I.

In this paper, a thermal inertia map was obtained from MODIS data on April 16, 2004 using SoA-TI model in Northern China Plain covering Latitude from 38.5°N to 40.5°N and Longitude from 115°E to 117.5°E. A soil moisture map was obtained based on the relationship between thermal inertia and soil moisture. And a distributive map of drought and waterlogging was obtained based on the relationship between ranks of drought and soil moisture. The drought map derived from MODIS data shows that most of the studied area was in a drought condition except the eastern littoral area where the soil moisture was in order. Generally speaking, the Northern China Plain was generally in a drought condition on April 16, 2004. The actual drought information obtained from the official website of Beijing Meteorological Bureau indicates that it was in a drought condition in Northern China Plain in the middle ten days of April. The result derived from MODIS data using SoA-TI model is in consistent with the actual situation. It indicates that it is an effective way to monitor regional drought and waterlogging by means of deriving soil moisture using SoA-TI model from MODIS data.	service-oriented architecture	Guoyin Cai;Jian Wu;Yong Xue;Yincui Hu;Jianping Guo;Jiakui Tang	2005	Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, 2005.

LAMO comprises geological and hydrogeological data provided by the Latvian Environment, Geology and Meteorology Centre (LEGMC) for the active groundwater zone of Latvia. In 2013–2015, LAMO was notably upgraded.

In the paper, methods of obtaining these maps are described.	approximation;map;remote terminal unit	Aivars Spalvins;Inta Lace;Kaspars Krauklis	2016		10.7148/2016-0066	geography;archaeology;geotechnical engineering	Vision	86.40443394600597	-57.60767289056087	139568
d1309323c154cd8380ffb86eab94a250fb38a1a0	smap soil moisture change as an indicator of drought conditions		Soil moisture is considered a key variable in drought analysis. The soil moisture dynamics given by the change in soil moisture between two time periods can provide information on the intensification or improvement of drought conditions. The aim of this work is to analyze how the soil moisture dynamics respond to changes in drought conditions over multiple time intervals. The change in soil moisture estimated from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite observations was compared with the United States Drought Monitor (USDM) and the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) over the contiguous United States (CONUS). The results indicated that the soil moisture change over 13-week and 26-week intervals is able to capture the changes in drought intensity levels in the USDM, and the change over a four-week interval correlated well with the one-month SPI values. This suggested that a short-term negative soil moisture change may indicate a lack of precipitation, whereas a persistent long-term negative soil moisture change may indicate severe drought conditions. The results further indicate that the inclusion of soil moisture change will add more value to the existing drought-monitoring products.		Rajasekaran Eswar;Narendra N.

Remote sensing allows spatially distributed estimates of air temperature to be computed, thus complementing the spatially sparse observations collected by ground stations. In this paper, a novel method for periodic (e.g., daily or monthly) air-temperature estimation from satellite images is proposed. It is based on support vector machines (SVMs) and generalizes, to the case of air temperature, a recently developed SVM-based approach to land and sea surface temperature estimation. Case-specific techniques aimed at computing periodic statistics of air temperature and based on the expectation-maximization algorithm are also integrated in the proposed approach. The method also allows the statistics of the estimation error to be modeled on a pixelwise basis by combining nonstationary stochastic processes and Clark's variance approximation.

b85de6335938b85aadcd35369dd7cf77257da8ff	a physically constrained calibration database for land surface temperature using infrared retrieval algorithms		Land surface temperature (LST) is routinely retrieved from remote sensing instruments using semi-empirical relationships between top of atmosphere (TOA) radiances and LST, using ancillary data such as total column water vapor or emissivity. These algorithms are calibrated using a set of forward radiative transfer simulations that return the TOA radiances given the LST and the thermodynamic profiles. The simulations are done in order to cover a wide range of surface and atmospheric conditions and viewing geometries. This study analyzes calibration strategies while considering some of the most critical factors that need to be taken into account when building a calibration dataset, covering the full dynamic range of relevant variables. A sensitivity analysis of split-windows and single channel algorithms revealed that selecting a set of atmospheric profiles that spans the full range of surface temperatures and total column water vapor combinations that are physically possible seems beneficial for the quality of the regression model. However, the calibration is extremely sensitive to the low-level structure of the atmosphere, indicating that the presence of atmospheric boundary layer features such as temperature inversions or strong vertical gradients of thermodynamic properties may affect LST retrievals in a non-trivial way. This article describes the criteria established in the EUMETSAT Land Surface Analysis—Satellite Application Facility to calibrate its LST algorithms, applied both for current and forthcoming sensors.	algorithm;coefficient;database;dynamic range;gradient;high- and low-level;lambert's cosine law;level structure;microsoft windows;microwave;semi-empirical quantum chemistry method;semiconductor industry;sensor;simulation;software propagation;spatial variability;store and forward;time of arrival	João P.

Therefore, phenological observation is important as an indicator of global warming and for estimation of the terrestrial carbon balance. Because phenological responses differ from species to species, precise monitoring from the species scale to the global scale is required. In this study, we analyzed images from digital cameras, which have proliferated in recent years, to investigate their utility as remote sensors. We collected daily images taken by digital cameras in national parks across Japan over 8 years in wetland mixed deciduous forest, and evergreen broadleaved forest. Values of red, green, and blue (RGB) channels in each pixel within images were extracted, and a vegetation green excess index (2G-RBi) was calculated to detect phenology. The time series of 2G-RBi showed clear phenological patterns of each vegetation type in each year at the species or community scale. Even physiological damage due to a typhoon was detected. The dates of green-up were estimated easily and objectively from the second derivative of 2G-RBi, and a trend in yearly green-up dates of various types of vegetation was demonstrated. Furthermore, a strong correlation between interannual variations in green-up dates and local spring temperature was found, and the sensitivity of green-up date to temperature was revealed. The results suggest the utility of digital cameras for phenological observations at precise temporal and spatial resolutions, despite a year-to-year drift of color balance of camera as a technical device. As a form of near-surface remote sensing, digital cameras could obtain significant ecological information. Establishing camera networks could help us understand phenological responses at a wide range of scales. Vegetation phenology, such as budburst, flowering, and leaf senescence, is controlled by the species and age of plant, as well as by seasonal variations in climate, day-length, nutrients, and other environmental factors. Recent climate change has strongly affected the trends of phenological events (Peñuelas and Fiella, 2001; Walther et al., 2002). Many studies show evidence of shifts in spring budburst onset and autumn leaf coloring in the Mediterranean region (Peñuelas et al., 2002), in Europe (Menzel et al., 2006) and in Japan (Matsumoto et al., 2003).

8d7f9acfeb480cfe93a8b4da0c477a5732ea2788	surface freshwater limitation explains worst rice production anomaly in india in 2002		India is the second-most populous country and the second-most important producer of rice of the world. Most Indian rice production depends on monsoon timing and dynamics. In 2002, the lowest monsoon precipitation of the last 130+ years was observed. It coincided with the worst rice production anomaly recorded by FAOSTAT from 1961 to 2014. In that year, freshwater limitation was blamed as responsible for the yield losses in the southeastern coastal regions. Given the important implication for local food security and international market stability, we here investigate the specific mechanisms behind the effects of this extreme meteorological drought on rice yield at the national and regional levels. To this purpose, we integrate output from the hydrological model, surface, and satellite observations for the different rice cropping cycles into state-of-the-art and novel climate indicators. In particular, we adopt the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) as an indicator of drought due to the local surface water balance anomalies (i.e., precipitation and evapotranspiration). We propose a new indicator of the renewable surface freshwater availability due to non-local sources, i.e., the standardized river discharge index (SDI) based on the anomalies of modelled river discharge data. We compare these indicators to the soil moisture observations retrieved from satellites. We link all diagnostics to the recorded yields at the national and regional level, quantifying the long-term correlations and the best match of the 2002 anomaly. Our findings highlight the need for integrating non-local surface freshwater dynamics with local rainfall variability to determine the soil moisture conditions in rice fields for yields assessment, modeling, and forecasting.	anomaly detection;discharger;esa;experiment;food and agriculture organization corporate statistical database;freshwater ecosystem;köppen climate classification;populous;real-time clock;real-time computing;spatial variability;typset and runoff	Matteo Zampieri;Gema Carmona Garcia;Frank Dentener;Murali K.

In this study, the accuracy of the SNO method is evaluated first based on a four year time series of SNO data between AVHRR/NOAA16 and MODIS/AQUA. It was found that the nominal accuracy for the 0.63 mum band is better than 0.9%, which can unambiguously identify the large offset (~9%) between AVHRR/NOAA16 and MODIS/AQUA. This discrepancy is thought to be caused by the calibration traceability and standard used for AVHRR. For the 0.84 mum band, the uncertainty varies with a variety of factors, including atmosphere, water vapor, and landcover types. Therefore, although a 10-20% difference is found between AVHRR/NOAA16 and MODIS/AQUA, the uncertainty in this analysis is estimated to be greater than +1-5%. Based on these baseline uncertainty assessments, a preliminary analysis of the calibration differences between AVHRR/MetOP and MODIS/AQUA is also performed, and small biases are found when the AVHRR prelaunch calibration coefficients are used. The use of global full resolution area coverage (FRAC) AVHRR data reduced the uncertainty in the analysis but a longer time series is needed in order to evaluate the ability of the SNO method for quantifying the relative degradation rate, since this rate appears to be relatively small for the 0.63 mum channel for newer instruments than that the previous AVHRR series. It is expected that the accuracy of the SNO method can be further improved with the FRAC data which can contribute to the generation of fundamental climate data records.	aqua;baseline (configuration management);coefficient;discrepancy function;elegant degradation;like button;simultaneous multithreading;time series;traceability	Changyong Cao;Aisheng Wu;Xiaoxiong Xiong;Xiangqian Wu	2007	2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423290	meteorology;atmospheric sciences;time series;physics;statistics;remote sensing	Visualization	83.27254036510469	-62.818072941545225	141005

In the present paper, the resolution of this problem was achieved, in the case of an homogeneous canopy, through a physically based bidirectional reflectance factor model. In a first validation phase, some inversions were performed against actual data obtained during the FIFE’89 experiment, and the retrieved parameters were found to be in good agreement with the corresponding in situ measurements. A sensitivity study was conducted afterward with synthetic data sets in order to identify and address some of the difficulties encountered while inverting such models, with a view to improving the accuracy of the retrievals and evaluating the inversion costs.

Because some anomalous behavior was occasionally found in AMSR-E C- and X-band data, a calibration check compared the AMSR-E data with measurements from the SSM/I sensor over two reference targets, namely a Russian evergreen forest and the sea surface, both of which have already been studied in the past. The algorithm for retrieving soil moisture uses both the brightness temperature at C-band in horizontal polarization and the polarization index at X-band for correcting the effects of vegetation. This algorithm is based on a simplified radiative transfer (tau-omega) model, which has been inverted by using the Nelder-Mead iterative minimization method. The algorithm was validated with microwave data collected on two sites during the Microwave Alpine Soil Moisture Experiment 2002 (MASMEx02) and the Soil Moisture Experiment 2002 (SMEX02), respectively. The first site, in Italy, was characterized by natural vegetation covers, whereas the second site, in Iowa (U.S.), was covered primarily in agricultural crops. In general, the soil moisture estimated by the algorithm from AMSR-E data and the SMC measured on the ground were in good agreement with each other in both sites, and five classes of soil moisture were easily identified	advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer;algorithm;alpine;aqua;chaitin's constant;iteration;iterative method;microwave;nelder–mead method;newton's method;polarization (waves);region-based memory management;sensor;watershed (image processing)	Simonetta Paloscia;Giovanni Macelloni;Emanuele Santi	2006	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2006.881714	meteorology;polarization;hydrology;optics;physics;quantum mechanics;remote sensing	Visualization	83.94837695158785	-63.59849999699143	141363

In our previous work, we have examined the diffracted fields by two edges with an arbitrary angle. In this paper, the characteristics of the diffracted fields by two horizontal edges of a building rooftop are discussed for two cases: a building without or with parapets. We also consider the effects of reflection by a rooftop and the ground. The numerical calculations are carried out for two edges of a conducting or concrete building rooftop. The results show that the waves grazing on the rooftop of concrete building are considerably attenuated for the low conductivity, but when parapets are constructed on the rooftop, the diffracted waves become stronger than the grazing waves. The effect of the field reflected by a rooftop for diffracted field by two parapets is small. When the incident wave is horizontally polarized, the reflected field by ground is strong, but for vertical polarized incidence, the ground reflection is weak.	experiment;heuristic;incidence matrix;numerical analysis;polarization (waves);radio wave;software propagation;uniform theory of diffraction	Jiro Iwashige;Leonard Barolli;Katsuki Hayashi;Ryo Nagao;Yuki Isayama	2012	2012 Sixth International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems	10.1109/CISIS.2012.61	geography;geotechnical engineering;optics;remote sensing	Robotics	83.89663468312432	-68.08884934128456	141638

Existing research of using Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) data mainly focuses on deriving average or maximum tree heights within a GLAS footprint, i.e. an ellipse with a diameter of 65 m. However, in most forests, it is likely that the tree heights within such ellipse are heterogeneous. Therefore, it is desired to uncover detailed tree height variation within a GLAS footprint. To the best of our knowledge, no such methods have been reported as of now. In this study, we aim to characterize tree heights’ variation within a GLAS footprint as different layers, each of which corresponds to trees with similar heights. As such, we developed a new method that embraces two steps: first, a refined Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) algorithm is proposed to decompose raw GLAS waveform into multiple Gaussian signals, within which it is hypothesized that each vegetation signal corresponds to a particular tree height layer. Second, for each layer, three parameters were first defined: Canopy Top Height (CTH), Crown Length (CL), and Cover Proportion (CP). Then we extracted the three parameters from each Gaussian signal through a defined model. In order to test our developed method, we set up a study site in Ejina, China where the dominant specie is Populus euphratica. Both simulated and field tree height data were adopted. With regard to the simulation data, results presented a very high agreement for the three predefined parameters between our results and simulation data. When our methods were applied to the field data, the respective R2 become 0.78 (CTH), CL (R2 = 0.76), CP (R2 = 0.74). Overall, our studies revealed that large footprint GLAS waveform data have the potentials for obtaining detailed forest height variation.	tree (data structure)	Jinyan Tian;Le Wang;Xiaojuan Li	2015	Int.

The tool estimates the quantity of pesticide input from non-point sources via surface runoff, tile drainage and spraydrift. Furthermore, the resulting predicted environmental concentration of pesticides in surface waters (PECsw) can be retrieved considering the mean daily inputs of substances into various types of river-basins characterized by their daily discharge. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) was created provide users of the DSS with easy access to the model algorithms. Model parameters like dose rate, DT50, Koc and date of pesticides application et cetera can be modified by the user in order to generate customized scenarios for a choice of field crops, orchards and vineyards. Results are available as grid cell maps for the territory of Germany with high temporal and spatial resolution featuring distinct values PECsw for various types of streams and landscapes.	accessibility;algorithm;decision support system;discharger;geographic information system;graphical user interface;map;stream (computing);typset and runoff	Björn Röpke;Martin Bach;Hans-Georg Frede	2004	Environmental Modelling and Software	10.1016/j.envsoft.2003.11.005	decision support system;environmental engineering;geology;hydrology;computer science;surface runoff	HCI	85.74432695641707	-55.785725440250005	142193
16c74680111380293a294a0425e5f8a991721dad	estimation of surface soil moisture from thermal infrared remote sensing using an improved trapezoid method	surface soil moisture;trapezoid method;modis;tibet plateau;thermal infrared remote sensing	Surface soil moisture (SM) plays a fundamental role in energy and water partitioning in the soil–plant–atmosphere continuum. A reliable and operational algorithm is much needed to retrieve regional surface SM at high spatial and temporal resolutions. Here, we provide an operational framework of estimating surface SM at fine spatial resolutions (using visible/thermal infrared images and concurrent meteorological data) based on a trapezoidal space defined by remotely sensed vegetation cover (Fc) and land surface temperature (LST). Theoretical solutions of the wet and dry edges were derived to achieve a more accurate and effective determination of the Fc/LST space. Subjectivity and OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2015, 7 8251 uncertainty arising from visual examination of extreme boundaries can consequently be largely reduced. In addition, theoretical derivation of the extreme boundaries allows a per-pixel determination of the VI/LST space such that the assumption of uniform atmospheric forcing over the entire domain is no longer required. The developed approach was tested at the Tibetan Plateau Soil Moisture/Temperature Monitoring Network (SMTMN) site in central Tibet, China, from August 2010 to August 2011 using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra images. Results indicate that the developed trapezoid model reproduced the spatial and temporal patterns of observed surface SM reasonably well, with showing a root-mean-square error of 0.06 m3·m−3 at the site level and 0.03 m3·m−3 at the regional scale. In addition, a case study on 2 September 2010 highlighted the importance of the theoretically calculated wet and dry edges, as they can effectively obviate subjectivity and uncertainties in determining the Fc/LST space arising from visual interpretation of satellite images. Compared with Land Surface Models (LSMs) in Global Land Data Assimilation System-1, the remote sensing-based trapezoid approach gave generally better surface SM estimates, whereas the LSMs showed systematic underestimation. Sensitivity analyses suggested that the trapezoid method is most sensitive to field capacity and temperature but less sensitive to other meteorological observations and parameters.	algorithm;apache continuum;data assimilation;intel 8251;pixel;trapezoidal rule	Yuting Yang;Huade Guan;Di Long;Bing Liu;Guanghua Qin;Jun Qin;Okke Batelaan	2015	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs70708250	trapezoidal rule;meteorology;hydrology;remote sensing	Graphics	84.55474559198136	-59.939283879596644	142325

Mountainous areas modify local incidence angles, implying significant impacts on brightness temperatures and, consequently, on soil moisture retrievals. The purpose of this paper is to establish a criterion in quantifying the relevance of topographic impacts at the SMOS scale ( ~ 40 km). The goal is thus to define a method of flagging the pixels according to the relative impact of topography on the brightness temperature. The proposed method uses the variogram of digital elevation model images. As a result, a map of the pixels to be flagged is produced to ensure that no soil moisture retrievals are carried out on pixels that are affected by strong topographic effects. As validation, a model was also used to simulate differences between brightness temperature variations between mountainous areas and flat surfaces.	angularjs;digital elevation model;incidence matrix;l band;microwave;pixel;relevance;simulation;topography	Arnaud Mialon;Laurent Coret;Yann Kerr;François Secherre;Jean-Pierre Wigneron	2008	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2007.914788	digital elevation model;hydrology;soil science;physics;remote sensing	Vision	83.5220409886247	-62.936821853751454	142609

67289ba4a23b39b8471d928210fd68650b77cae6	using sebal to investigate how variations in climate impact on crop evapotranspiration		Water allocation to crops, and especially to the most water intensive ones, has always been of great importance in agricultural processes. Deficit or excessive irrigation could create either crop health-related problems or water over-consumption, respectively. The latter could lead to groundwater depletion and deterioration of its quality through deep percolation of agrichemical residuals. In this context, and under the current conditions where Cyprus is facing effects of possible climate changes, the purpose of this study seeks to estimate the needed crop water requirements of the past (1995–2004) and the corresponding ones of the present (2005–2015) in order to test if there were any significant changes regarding the crop water requirements of the most water-intensive trees in Cyprus. The Mediterranean region has been identified as the region that will suffer the most from variations of climate. Thus the paper refers to effects of these variations on crop evapotranspiration (ETc) using remotely-sensed data from Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI employing a sound methodology used worldwide, the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL). Though the general feeling is that of changes on climate will consequently affect ETc, our results indicate that there is no significant effect of climate variation on crop evapotranspiration, despite the fact that some climatic factors have changed. Applying Student’s t-test, the mean values for the most water-intensive trees in Cyprus of the 1994–2004 decade have shown no statistical difference from the mean values of 2005–2015 for all the cases, concluding that the climate change taking place in the past decades in Cyprus have either not affected the crop evapotranspiration or the crops have managed to adapt to the new environmental conditions through time.	algorithm;depletion region;evaporation;percolation;region-based memory management;requirement	Giorgos Papadavid;Damianos Neocleous;Giorgos Kountios;Marinos Markou;Anastasios Michailidis;Athanasios Ragkos;Diofantos G.

We used satellite-based and literature-based methods to derive kc values for a distributed hydrologic model. We evaluated the impact of different kc parametrization methods on the water balance and simulated hydrologic response at the basin and sub-basin scale. The hydrological model SPHY was calibrated and validated for a period of 15 years for the upper Segura basin (~2500 km2) in Spain, which is characterized by a wide range of terrain, soil, and ecosystem conditions. The model was then applied, using six kc parameterization methods, to determine their spatial and temporal impacts on actual evapotranspiration, streamflow, and soil moisture. The parameterization methods used include: (i) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) observations from MODIS; (ii) seasonally-averaged NDVI patterns, cell-based and landuse-based; and (iii) literature-based tabular values per land use type. The analysis shows that the influence of different kc parametrization methods on basin-level streamflow is relatively small and constant throughout the year, but it has a bigger effect on seasonal evapotranspiration and soil moisture. In the autumn especially, deviations can go up to about 15% of monthly streamflow. At smaller, sub-basin scale, deviations from the NDVI-based reference run can be more than 30%. Overall, the study shows that modeling of future hydrological changes can be improved by using remote sensing information for the parameterization of crop coefficients.	coefficient;detailed balance;ecosystem;https;image resolution;information privacy;map;reference model;research data archiving;semantic parameterization;simulation;table (information)	Johannes E.

When making flood forecasting, the influence of this variability on runoff should be considered. In this paper, the distributed hydrological modeling technique was adopted to simulate flood discharge with consideration of spatial variability using DEMs and remotely sensed data. In our approach, the grid based digital elevation data was used for the presentation of watershed discretization and deriving flow path system and parameters. The infiltration and rainfall excess on each hillslope grid cell were calculated using the Green-Ampt infiltration equation. Soil lateral flow was estimated based on Darcy's law and continuity equation, overland and channel flows were calculated by using one-dimensional kinematic wave equations on hillslope and channel grid cells respectively. The land use and land cover data derived from remotely sensed images was used for the determination of Manning's roughness coefficients. The soil type data was used for deriving soil hydraulic parameters needed for calculation. The approach was applied in Jiaokou Watershed with area of 259 km2, a sub-basin of Yongjiang River in Zhejiang Province, China. The data collected for this study included land cover processed from Landsat TM images, soil type distribution from the soil maps, and 100-m spatial resolution DEMs produced from digital topographic maps. Spatial distribution of rainfall for each flood event was calculated by using distance inverse interpolation methods. Nine flood events were simulated, two of which were used for calibration, and the others for validation. The simulated hydrographs at basin outlet showed good agreement with observed ones for both calibrated and validated flood events, and average coefficients of efficiency were 94% for calibrated flood events and 92% for validated flood events.	coefficient;computation;discharger;discretization;interpolation;lateral thinking;map;offset binary;scott continuity;simulation;spatial variability;typset and runoff;topography;watershed (image processing)	Jinkang Du;Shunping Xie;Youpeng Xu;Hua Xie;Yujun Hu;Peifa Wang;Shunfu Hu	2006	2006 IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/IGARSS.2006.272	open-channel flow;spatial variability;topographic map;wave equation;geomorphology;image resolution;digital elevation model;hydrology;continuity equation;flood forecasting;physics;remote sensing;soil type;data collection	Visualization	86.36500229153688	-58.61804072211006	144383

The measurements were performed by a 35-GHz fully polarimetric radar system with transmitter and receiver modules mounted on separate rotatable arches. The acquired data were analyzed to determine the angular sensitivities of several attributes of the scattered field, including amplitudes and phase differences of the polarized scattering coefficients, and their copolarized and cross-polarized ratios. Generally speaking, the scattering pattern exhibits a weak dependence on the scattering angle thetass (except along the backward direction and forward specular direction), but it exhibits a strong dependence on the azimuth angle phi, particularly for the cross-polarized components. Much of the dependence is attributed to the vectorial definition of polarization in a standard frame of reference. Comparison of the measured data with calculations based on the second-order physical optics model reveals reasonable overall agreement between theory and observations (typically within 4 dB)	angularjs;coefficient;dynamic range;h. h. scott, inc.;polarimetry;polarization (waves);radar;rough set;scattering theory;transmitter	Adib Y.

Buildings in urban areas alter the surface roughness and the drag effect of urban surfaces, which in turn affects urban boundary layer dynamics. Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar is considered to be an effective means for aerodynamic roughness retrieval because polarimetric parameters are sensitive to the surface roughness and geometric structure of a given target. In this paper, the correlation between radar polarimetric parameters and aerodynamic roughness in urban areas are analyzed. And then the optimal polarimetric parameter for the aerodynamic roughness calculation was determined. Finally a quantitative relationship was set up to retrieve the aerodynamic roughness length in urban areas from polarimetric SAR data.	polarimetry;radar;roughness length	Fengli Zhang;Minmin Sha;Guojun Wang;Zhikun Li;Yun Shao	2016	2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730959	meteorology;surface roughness;aerodynamics;hydrology;scattering;correlation;physics;remote sensing	Visualization	83.31950516172991	-65.10272167705017	144596

To help accomplish this, FTIR spectrometer measurements were made on a set of known targets over a period of three days in order to assess the precision and repeatability of thermal IR spectral emissivity measurements of the effects of view direction and surface roughness. These measurements are intended to provide validation data for the model and advance our capability to make precise measurements of emissivity in the field. Two types of rock targets, each with three roughness classes and at three view nadir angles were measured over three consecutive days. The results within days were very consistent. Emissivity for the 60 degree view was shifted downward: a sensitivity analysis was conducted to explain this and other variations and is discussed in this paper. The spectra for the large rock size class tended to be lower than targets with smaller rocks. Preliminary modeling results will be presented.	rca spectra 70;repeatability	Lee K.

In the ocean, eddies are 10 to 150 km in diameter, are spawned by boundary currents and baroclinic instabilities, may live for hundreds of days, and travel for hundreds of kilometers. Eddies are important in climate studies because they transport heat, salt, and nutrients through the world's oceans and are vessels of biological productivity. The study of eddies in global ocean-climate models requires large-scale, high-resolution simulations. This poses a problem for feasible (timely) eddy analysis, as ocean simulations generate massive amounts of data, causing a bottleneck for traditional analysis workflows. To enable eddy studies, we have developed an in situ workflow for the quantitative and qualitative analysis of MPAS-Ocean, a high-resolution ocean climate model, in collaboration with the ocean model research and development process. Planned eddy analysis at high spatial and temporal resolutions will not be possible with a postprocessing workflow due to various constraints, such as storage size and I/O time, but the in situ workflow enables it and scales well to ten-thousand processing elements.	blood vessel;climate model;code;debugging;diameter (qualifier value);documentation;headache;image resolution;input/output;iteration;model for prediction across scales;nutrients;requirement;salt (cryptography);scalability;simulation;small;verification of theories;video post-processing;benefit;standards characteristics	Jonathan Woodring;Mark Petersen;Andre Schmeißer;John Patchett;James P.

Through its Evapotranspiration (ET) Toolbox interface, the AWARDS system provides guidance to local farmers on when and where to deliver water to the crops. The ET Toolbox is based on water usage estimates (evapotranspiration and open water evaporation) on a grid cell basis (4 kmtimes4 km). Currently, crop water use estimates are determined using a modified-Penman ET approach. To improve upon this parameterization, we use the Community Land Model (CLM2.0) within the LDAS system downscaled to a 1 km grid cell resolution. Our work aims to improve evapotranspiration and soil moisture estimates in the Rio Grande River basin through the improvement of the CLM2.0 parameterization of surface processes. We specifically intend to assimilate up to four land surface temperature (LST) observations per day from the Terra/Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments, at 1 km resolution, into the CLM2.0 land surface model. To verify the performance of the assimilation approach we deploy flux towers at two different sites. We focus our ground data collection on riparian and agricultural areas. Ultimately, our results should improve the daily forecasts of vegetation water requirements and, when integrated into operational decision support tools, aid water resource managers in making flood and drought assessments and predictions	aqua;data assimilation;decision support system;evaporation;image resolution;land surface model (lsm version 1.0);requirement;scheduling (computing);winsock	Ana C.

An approximation for the coherent and incoherent scattering cross section of a single ice block is formulated and validated by comparison with moment method computations. It is found that the model is accurate for lossy ice blocks but underestimates the scattering when the loss is low, which is attributed to multiple scattering within the blocks. The backscattering coefficient is evaluated by averaging over an ensemble of blocks with a distribution of slopes and effects of shadowing are estimated. In situ measurements of ice ridge properties in the Baltic Sea are used as input when comparing the model results with coincident ERS-1 SAR data. The model is found to agree with the data to within 1.5 dB, where the discrepancies are mainly due to the uncertainty of the dielectric loss factor in the ice blocks. The model also shows good agreement with airborne 5.3 GHz SAR data of a first-year shear ridge in the Beaufort Sea for incidence angles between 25-50.	microwave	Anders Carlström	1997	IEEE Trans.

a7d9ba00c1ff016cc05c9cf8cfc21595d69e2902	improvement of co2-dial signal-to-noise ratio using lifting wavelet transform	co2 monitoring;differential absorption lidar;high-quality signal acquisition;lifting wavelet transform	Atmospheric CO₂ plays an important role in controlling climate change and its effect on the carbon cycle. However, detailed information on the dynamics of CO₂ vertical mixing remains lacking, which hinders the accurate understanding of certain key features of the carbon cycle. Differential absorption lidar (DIAL) is a promising technology for CO₂ detection due to its characteristics of high precision, high time resolution, and high spatial resolution. Ground-based CO₂-DIAL can provide the continuous observations of the vertical profile of CO₂ concentration, which can be highly significant to gaining deeper insights into the rectification effect of CO₂, the ratio of respiration photosynthesis, and the CO₂ dome in urban areas. A set of ground-based CO₂-DIAL systems were developed by our team and highly accurate long-term laboratory experiments were conducted. Nonetheless, the performance suffered from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in field explorations because of decreasing aerosol concentrations with increasing altitude and surrounding interference according to the results of our experiments in Wuhan and Huainan. The concentration of atmospheric CO₂ is derived from the difference of signals between on-line and off-line wavelengths; thus, low SNR will cause the superimposition of the final inversion error. In such a situation, an efficient and accurate denoising algorithm is critical for a ground-based CO₂-DIAL system, particularly in field experiments. In this study, a method based on lifting wavelet transform (LWT) for CO₂-DIAL signal denoising was proposed. This method, which is an improvement of the traditional wavelet transform, can select different predictive and update functions according to the characteristics of lidar signals, thereby making it suitable for the signal denoising of CO₂-DIAL. Experiment analyses were conducted to evaluate the denoising effect of LWT. For comparison, ensemble empirical mode decomposition denoising was also performed on the same lidar signal. In addition, this study calculated the coefficient of variation (CV) at the same altitude among multiple original signals within 10 min and then performed the same calculation on the denoised signal. Finally, high-quality signal of ground-based CO₂-DIAL was obtained using the LWT denoising method. The differential absorption optical depths of the denoised signals obtained via LWT were calculated, and the profile distribution information of CO₂ concentration was acquired during field detection by using our developed CO₂-DIAL systems.	aerosol dose form;algorithm;basis pursuit denoising;biological science disciplines;carbon dioxide;carbon cycle;coefficient of variance;conceptualization (information science);concurrent versions system;conflict (psychology);data curation;digital curation;dome;experiment;hilbert–huang transform;information science;interference (communication);lifting scheme;maxima and minima;mental suffering;natural science disciplines;noise reduction;online and offline;photosynthesis;rectifier;signal-to-noise ratio;singular value decomposition;small;tacrine;wavelet transform;wavelength	Chengzhi Xiang;Ge Han;Yuxin Zheng;Xin Ma;Wei Gong	2018		10.3390/s18072362		HCI	82.96761156135294	-59.71749113851447	145361

Until now, the studies performing digital zoning of terroirs have relied on recent spatial data and scant attention has been paid to ancient geoinformation likely to retrace past biological condition of vines and especially occurrence of vine mortality. Is vine mortality characterized by recurrent and specific patterns and if so, are these patterns related to terroir units and/or past landuse? This study aimed at performing a historical and spatial tracing of vine mortality patterns using a long time-series of aerial survey images (1947–2010), in combination with recent data: soil apparent electrical conductivity EM38 measurements, very high resolution Pleiades satellite images, and a detailed field survey. Within a 6 ha-estate in the Southern Rhone Valley, landuse and planting history were retraced and the map of missing vines frequency was constructed from the whole time series including a 2015-Pleiades panchromatic band. Within-field terroir units were obtained from a support vector machine classifier computed on the spectral bands and NDVI of Pleiades images, EM38 data and morphometric data.#R##N##R##N#Repeated spatial patterns of missing vines were highlighted throughout several plantings, uprootings, and vine replacements, and appeared to match some within-field terroir units, being explained by their specific soil characteristics, vine/soil management choices and the past landuse of the 1940s. Missing vines frequency was spatially correlated with topsoil CaCO3 content, and negatively correlated with topsoil iron, clay, total N, organic C contents and NDVI. A retrospective spatio-temporal assessment of terroir therefore brings a renewed focus on some key parameters for maintaining a sustainable grape production.	aerial photography;multi-source;spatial analysis;time series	Emmanuelle Vaudour;L.

However, due to the spatial inhomogeneities of ice clouds and the localized nature of many snow storms, their differential effects may become important for precise relative GPS positioning. >	global positioning system	James M.

All sites showed a regular seasonal variation in EVI, ranging from a mean low for all sites of 0.41 to a mean high of 0.61. The amplitude of variability in NDVI was about 50% that of EVI. Minimum EVI, corresponding to minimum leaf area, occurred in late May, about 40 days preceding maximum river stage; EVI peaked in mid-October, about 30 days before lowest river levels.

This CWC is defined by the product of the leaf equivalent water thickness (EWT) and the leaf area index (LAI). In this paper, in particular the spectral information provided by the canopy water absorption feature at 970 nm for estimating and predicting CWC was studied using a modelling approach and in situ spectroradiometric measurements. The relationship of the first derivative at the right slope of the 970 nm water absorption feature with CWC was investigated with the PROSAIL radiative transfer model and tested for field spectroradiometer measurements on two test sites. The first site was a heterogeneous floodplain with natural vegetation like grasses and various shrubs. The second site was an extensively grazed fen meadow. PROSAIL simulations (using coupled SAIL/PROSPECT-5 models) showed a linear relationship between the first derivative over the 1015–1050 nm spectral interval and CWC (R = 0.97). For 8 plots at the floodplain site the spectral derivative over the 1015–1050 nm interval obtained with an ASD FieldSpec spectroradiometer yielded an R of 0.51 with CWC. For 40 plots at the fen meadow ASD FieldSpec spectral measurements yielded an R of 0.68 for the derivative over the 1015–1050 nm interval with CWC. Consistency of the results confirmed the potential of using simulation results for calibrating the relationship between this first derivative and CWC. 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Similarly to scatterometer observations of ocean waves, the backscattering coefficient (sigma0) response of land surfaces depends on both the incidence and azimuth angle under which the observations are made. In order to retrieve geophysical parameters from scatterometer data, it is necessary to account for azimuthal-modulation effects of the backscattered signal. In the present study, this paper localizes the regions affected by a strong azimuthal signal dependence when observed with the European Remote Sensing Satellite Scatterometer and the SeaWinds Scatterometer on QuikSCAT (QSCAT). The possible physical reasons for the azimuthal effects, relating the very detailed QSCAT azimuthal response to the spatial orientation of special topographic features and land cover within the sensor footprint, were then discussed. Different methods for normalizing the backscattering coefficient with respect of observation azimuth angle were also proposed and evaluated. First, the mean local incidence angle of the sensor footprint using the shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model (DEM) were modeled and concluded that the resolution of the DEM is too coarse to characterize most of the observed azimuthal effects. A more effective way of normalizing the backscatter with respect to azimuth is then found to be by using historical backscatter observations to statistically determine the expected backscatter at each observation azimuth and incidence angle as well as time of the year. The efficiency of this method is limited to the availability of past measurements for each location on the Earth	coefficient;digital elevation model;incidence matrix;jaccard index;ku band;location (geography);microwave;modulation;shuttle radar topography mission	Zoltan Bartalis;Klaus Scipal;Wolfgang Wagner	2006	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2006.872084	meteorology;wind wave;digital elevation model;geodesy;anisotropy;physics;remote sensing	Mobile	83.58740068413431	-64.3541117674243	146480
377f9ad7923b130cb440a7e527a6695579d00757	a 55-year time series station for primary production in the adriatic sea: data correction, extraction of photosynthesis parameters and regime shifts		In 1962, a series of in situ primary production measurements began in the Adriatic Sea, at a station near the island of Vis. To this day, over 55 years of monthly measurements through the photic zone have been accumulated, including close to 3000 production measurements at different depths. The measurements are conducted over a six-hour period around noon, and the average production rate extrapolated linearly over day length to calculate daily production. Here, a non-linear primary production model is used to correct these estimates for potential overestimation of daily production due to linear extrapolation. The assimilation numbers are recovered from the measured production profiles and subsequently used to model production at depth. Using the recovered parameters, the model explained 87% of variability in measured normalized production at depth. The model is then used to calculate daily production at depth, and it is observed to give on average 20% lower daily production at depth than the estimates based on linear extrapolation. Subsequently, water column production is calculated, and here, the model predicted on average 26% lower water column production. With the recovered parameters and the known magnitude of the overestimation, the time-series of water column production is then re-established with the non-linearly-corrected data. During this 55-year period, distinct regimes were observed, which were classified with a regime shift detection method. It is then demonstrated how the recovered parameters can be used in a remote sensing application. A seasonal cycle of the recovered assimilation number is constructed along with the seasonal cycle of remotely-sensed chlorophyll. The two are then used to model the seasonal cycle of water column production. An upper and a lower bound on the seasonal cycle of water column production based on remotely-sensed chlorophyll data are then presented. Measured water column production was found to be well within the range of remotely-sensed estimates. With this work, the utility of in situ measurements as a means of providing information on the assimilation number is presented and its application as a reference for remote sensing models highlighted.	data assimilation;extrapolation;heart rate variability;keneth alden simons;nonlinear system;remote sensing application;rendering (computer graphics);spatial variability;stationary process;step detection;time series;visual instruction set	Zarko Kovac;Trevor Platt;Zivana Nincevic Gladan;Mira Morovic;Shubha Sathyendranath;Dionysios E.

Land use/land cover changes (LUCC) are a major cause of ecological environmental changes. In this paper, the spatial landscape dynamics from 1978 to 2005 in this area are monitored and recent changes are analyzed, using the Landsat TM (MSS) images of 1978, 1988, 1995, 2000 and 2005. Vegetation cover fractions for a vegetation cover analysis are retrieved from MODIS/Terra imagery from 2000 to 2006, being the period before and after the rising water level of the reservoir. Several analytical indices have been used to analyze spatial and temporal changes. Results indicate that cropland, woodland, and grassland areas reduced continuously over the past 30 years, while river and built-up area increased by 2.79% and 4.45% from 2000 to 2005, respectively. The built-up area increased at the cost of decreased cropland, woodland and grassland. The vegetation cover fraction increased slightly. We conclude that significant changes in land use/land cover have occurred in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area. The main cause is a continuous economic and urban/rural development, followed by environmental management policies after construction of the Three Gorges Dam.	multi-source	Jixian Zhang;Zhengjun Liu;Xiaoxia Sun	2009	Int.

The model takes statistical descriptions of surface spectral reflectances and temperature variations in a scene and propagates them through the effects of the atmosphere, the sensor, and processing transformations. A resultant system performance metric is then calculated. This paper presents the theory for analytically transforming surface statistics to at-sensor spectral radiance statistics for a downward-looking hyperspectral sensor observing both reflected sunlight and thermally emitted radiation. Comparisons of the model's predictions with measurements from an airborne hyperspectral sensor are presented. An example is included to show the model's utility in understanding the magnitude of full spectrum radiance components.	airborne ranger;algorithm;end-to-end principle;resultant;sensor;spatial variability;systems design;vii	John P.

3510ea869183fbac5fabe96fb1eef12215ddce6a	reduced methane emissions from santa barbara marine seeps		Airborne in situ and remote sensing measurements of methane were performed over the marine seeps in the Santa Barbara Channel close to the Coal Oil Point in California on two days in June and August 2014 with the aim to re-assess their methane emissions. During this period, methane column averaged dry air mole fractions derived from airborne remote sensing measurements in the short-wave infrared and airborne in situ measurements of methane indicate that emissions are 2–6 kt CH4 y−1, significantly lower than expected from previous publications. This is also confirmed by the on ground in situ measurement time series recorded at the onshore West Campus Monitoring Station in Santa Barbara. Using a time series of methane data, a decline in methane concentrations between 2008 and 2015 of more than a factor of two was derived for air masses originating from the seep field direction.	airborne ranger;time series	Thomas Krings;Ira Leifer;Sven Krautwurst;Konstantin Gerilowski;Markus Horstjann;Heinrich Bovensmann;Michael Buchwitz;John P.

Despite the call by governmental and non-governmental agencies to develop several wastewater treatment plants and sewage networks in an effort to control this problem, these efforts do not seem to be coordinated or based on comprehensive and integrated assessments of current and projected conditions in the basin. This paper provides an overview of the development and implementation of an integrated decision support system (DSS) designed to help policy makers and other stakeholders have a clearer understanding of the key factors and processes involved in the sewage induced degradation of surface water quality in the ULB, and formulate, assess and evaluate alternative management plans. The DSS is developed based on the WEAP model, which provides a GIS based and visual simulation environment and scenario management and analysis capabilities. The DSS was used to assess two main water quality management plans taking into consideration hydrological, spatial and seasonal variabilities. An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted to identify best buy plans. The results have confirmed the gravity of this problem and demonstrated the importance of taking immediate action on curbing this onslaught on this valuable and scarce fresh water resource. 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

b50c114d1898d75d5e5b940b67f2aee8a8fdcf80	the city gravity migration of the urban agglomeration in the middle reach of yangtze river based on dmsp nighttime light		The urban agglomerations in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River occupy an important position in the regional development pattern of China. Grasping the spatial and temporal development pattern of urban agglomerations accurately is of great significance for the planning and development of urban agglomerations. This paper selects the DMSP/OLS nighttime stable lighting data from year 1993 to year 2011, extracts the annual urban land area of 33 cities in the city group based on the threshold value, and calculates the total annual nighttime light intensity value and the growth rate of each city. By using the center of gravity model and statistical data, the distances and angles of shifts in the centers of gravity of the three major urban agglomerations in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River are explored. Studies have shown that in the past 20 years, the urban agglomeration in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River have achieved rapid development during the year 1993 to year 2011, and the total nighttime light has increased by about 5 times. The center of gravity of urban agglomerations in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River has gradually shifted from the northwest to the southeast, and the migration distance has gradually become smaller since 2004, and the center of gravity of urban agglomerations has gradually stabilized.

In the first approach, i.e., the vegetation cover method (VCM), the land surface emissivity (EM) is computed for Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) infrared channels and for the 3- to 14- range using information on the pixel fraction of vegetation cover (FVC). The VCM uses a lookup table, which takes into account the channel's spectral response function, and laboratory reflectance spectra for different materials. The accuracy of the VCM depends on the reliability of FVC and the land cover classification. The EM for SEVIRI split-window channels is primarily used as an internal product by Land SAF for land surface temperature (LST) estimations. However, sensitivity studies show that LST often fails to meet the required accuracy of 2 K over desert and semiarid regions, where the VCM is unable to model the EM spatial variability, which is mostly associated with soil composition. Moreover, it is also over such areas where the atmosphere is generally dry that the impact of EM uncertainties on LST is largest. A second approach to determine the EM for SEVIRI split-window channels is currently being tested. This methodology allows the simultaneous retrieval of LST and channel EMs with the assumption that the latter remain constant. The channel EMs are then averaged over a 22-day period to filter out the noise in the retrievals. A first analysis of the maps obtained for an area within Northern Africa shows spatial patterns with features also present in the surface albedo.	expectation–maximization algorithm;fingerprint verification competition;frequency response;lookup table;map;pixel;spatial variability;store and forward;video for windows	Isabel F.

e074708c819b195fe30a53b6f0970c17828e1843	monitoring cotton crop evapotranspiration based on satellite data		The water demand to meet seasonal and long-term water needs in Thessaly, central Greece, is related to historical semi-arid conditions in the region, which is the main agricultural area of the country. In this paper irrigation water requirements are assessed through the estimation and monitoring of crop evapotranspiration ETc for cotton fields in Thessaly. Remotely sensed data are used to delineate the spatial and temporal variability of crop coefficient Kc and crop ETc. Cotton crop production is examined for the years 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010. Weekly ground based measurements carried out throughout the growing season and satellite images (Landsat TM) were processed for the corresponding time period. Satellite data provide the cover capability of large scale areas and monitoring of crop during growth stages. Methodology can be applied in large scale areas for the calculation of Kc and extend to other crops using satellite data. The results are in good agreement with groundtruth observations.	coefficient;ground truth;pleiades (supercomputer);requirement;semiconductor industry;spatial variability	Anna Blanta;Dalezios Nicolas;Aglaia Maliara;Nicos Spyropoulos	2011			evapotranspiration;growing season;agronomy;irrigation;satellite;crop coefficient;agriculture;environmental science;crop;agroforestry	AI	84.28949117792578	-57.851029499009584	149021

Typical signatures of the time series (the first 180 days of a year) in the region characterized by three different winter surface conditions, i.e., high-moisture frozen ground, nonfrozen ground, and low-moisture cold (desert/dryland) regions, were analyzed with meteorological records. In all regions, brightness temperature showed an increasing trend during the first 180 days of the year, but backscatter trends decreased in frozen ground regions, increased in nonfrozen ground regions, and were steady in desert regions. Diurnal brightness temperature differences were lesser in regions with than without seasonal freeze-thaw events due to the surface diurnal temperature differences in winter. A method based on these signature analysis results was proposed. First, frozen ground, nonfrozen ground, and desert regions could be distinguished by using two proposed indices, the temporal difference between morning and evening brightness temperatures (TI) and the slope ratio between backscatter and brightness temperature time series (SI). Second, a logistic function of the daily signal difference between active and passive time series (DIi) could detect the beginning and end of the freeze-thaw transition.	antivirus software;backscatter (email);microwave;mike lesser;temporal difference learning;time series	Lijian Han;Atsushi Tsunekawa;Mitsuru Tsubo	2012	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2011.2171032	temporal difference learning;meteorology;climatology;time series;mathematics;physics;statistics;remote sensing	Visualization	83.58123077624464	-58.04489137797151	149605

In addition to being of significant interest for climatological investigations, reliable information on snow cover is of high value for the purpose of hydrological forecasting and numerical weather prediction. Terrestrial snow covers up to 50 million km2 of the Northern Hemisphere in winter and is characterized by high spatial and temporal variability. Making satellite observations the only means for providing timely and complete observations of the global snow cover.	climate model;numerical analysis;numerical weather prediction;spatial variability;terrestrial television	Kari Luojus;Juval Cohen;Jaakko Ikonen;Jouni Pulliainen;Matias Takala;Katriina Veijola;Juha Lemmetyinen;Thomas Nagler;Chris Derksen;Ross Brown	2018	IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8517494	snow;remote sensing;optical imaging;climatology;arctic;northern hemisphere;satellite;arctic climate;computer science;numerical weather prediction;climate model	Embedded	83.80643024448776	-58.171104942231615	149673

Visible and near infrared AISA Eagle (Specim, Finland) and thermal AHS-160 (Sensytech Inc., USA) imageries were acquired with an airborne survey on a farm-level experimental site where maize (Zea mays L.) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) were grown with three different irrigation treatments. Vegetation biophysical and eco-physiological measurements were collected concurrently with the airborne campaign. Leaf fluorescence yield (ΔF/Fm′) resulted to be a good indirect measure of water stress. Therefore, ΔF/Fm′ measurements were compared against remotely sensed indicators: (i) the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI), (ii) the sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence at 760 nm (F760), retrieved by the Fraunhofer line depth method and (iii) the canopy temperature (TC) calculated decoupling soil and vegetation contributions. TC was related to ΔF/Fm′ with the highest determination coefficient (R2 = 0.65), followed by PRI586 (reference band at 586 nm) (R2 = 0.51). The relationship with F760 was significant but weaker (R2 = 0.36). The coefficient of determination increased up to 0.54 when pigment concentration was considered by multiplying ΔF/Fm′ and chlorophyll content, confirming the close relationship between passive fluorescence signal, pigment content and light photosystem efficiency. PRI586, F760 and TC maps were produced in maize and sorghum plots. The differences in the average values of PRI586, F760 and TC extracted from the plots with different water treatments showed that water treatments were well discriminated in maize plots by the three remotely sensed indicators. This was confirmed by the visual observation of the PRI586, F760 and TC maps, while in sorghum plots, F760 and TC appeared more sensitive to water stress compared to PRI586.	motorola canopy	Cinzia Panigada;Micol Rossini;Michele Meroni;Chiara Cilia;Lorenzo Busetto;Stefano Amaducci;Mirco Boschetti;Sergio Cogliati;Valentina Picchi;F.

Artificial light at night attracts and aggregates fish and squid because it mimics light produced by bioluminescent marine animals. The fish men use lamps to aggregate squid for squid jigging. So the squid fishing vessels can be detected by the sensor of Operational Linescan System (OLS) on Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). This article mainly used OLS shimmer data from DMSP-F18 satellite covering the Pacific northwest ocean and estimated the quantity of squid jigging fishing vessels close to the terminator to expound the method that people can utilize the night-time satellite remote sensing data to estimate the quantity of light-trapping fishing vessels.	ordinary least squares;the terminator	Tianfei Cheng;Weifeng Zhou;Hongyun Xu;Wei Fan	2016		10.1007/978-981-10-3966-9_36	meteorology;oceanography;geography;remote sensing	Robotics	82.95821425723325	-58.504830038759216	150097

In this paper, we propose three methods to delineate the volume of such equipotential water bodies through a combination of altimetry (1D), Landsat (2D) and bathymetry (2D) data, namely an altimetry-bathymetry-volume method (ABV), a Landsat-bathymetry-volume method (LBV) and an altimetry-Landsat-volume-variation method (ALVV). The first two data products are further merged by a Kalman-filter-based state space model (SSM) to obtain a combined estimate (CSSME) time series and near future prediction. To validate our methods, we tested them on the well-measured Lake Mead and further applied them on the poorly gauged Aral Sea, which has inaccurate bathymetry and very limited ground observation data. We updated the lake bathymetry of the Aral Sea, which was more than half a century old. The resultant remote sensing products have a very good long-term agreement among each other. The Lake Mead volume estimations are very highly coherent with the ground observations for all cases (R2 > 0.96 and NRMSE < 2.1%), except for the forecast (R2 = 0.75 and NRMSE = 3.7%). Due to lack of in situ data for the Aral Sea, the estimated volumes are compared, and the entire Aral Sea LBV and ABV have R2 = 0.91 and NRMSE = 5.5%, and the forecast compared to CSSME has R2 = 0.60 and NRMSE = 2.4%.	bathymetry;coherence (physics);computation;data assimilation;emoticon;finite volume method;kalman filter;missing data;newton's method;resultant;state space;state-space representation;time series;whole earth 'lectronic link	Alka Singh;Ujjwal Kumar;Florian Seitz	2015	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs71215872	meteorology;hydrology;altimeter;remote sensing	Mobile	87.21007061907112	-61.70486963794761	150754
3a0610b134cbfe78e1ebc60aa5ac51fb73923012	impact of urban development and vegetation on land surface temperature of dhaka city		This paper addresses both quantitative and qualitative assessment of the relationship between the land surface temperatures (LST) and land cover (LC) changes in Dhaka Metro Area (DMA) using Landsat TM/ETM+ data over the period from 1989 to 2010. The LC map was prepared using supervised classification methods. On the other hand, using the calibration of spectral radiance and emissivity correction LST has been derived from the thermal band of Landsat TM/ETM+. To establish the relationship between LST and LC, GIS based spatial simulation has been conducted. The changing of LST is found to be directly correlated with LC transition. LST has shown to increase in areas with growing urban developments. In contrary, the amount of Vegetation (NDVI) is negatively correlated with LST. The trend of LST and LC transitions indicates that LST will be abruptly increased in near future.

Lakes typically differ from their surrounding terrain regarding snowpack structure, and thus microwave emission. Ice and water layers beneath the snow also influence the result when compared to frozen ground, decreasing brightness temperatures especially on low frequencies. Estimates of snowpack properties from low-resolution microwave data, such as snow depth or snow water equivalent, are susceptible to these effects. In order to correct for the resulting underestimation, the lake fraction over the area of study as well as the emission properties of those lakes should be known. This could potentially be achieved through the assimilation of modeled estimates of snow-covered lake emissions to satellite data. In this study, a modified HUT snow emission model, including modeled influence from the ice and water layers, is applied to model emission over several lakes in Finland during two winter periods. Input parameters to the model are derived from a large quantity of available ground data. Airborne radiometer data are applied to investigate the quality of the emission estimates. Finally, emissions over several AMSR-E pixels are modeled using fractional lake coverage and available ground data.	advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer;airborne ranger;data assimilation;microwave;pixel;snow	Anna Kontu;Sami Kemppainen;Juha Lemmetyinen;Jouni Pulliainen;Martti Hallikainen	2008	IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779905	meteorology;snow;probability density function;image resolution;atmospheric sciences;decision support system;radiometer;emissivity;brightness temperature;low frequency;optics;physics;remote sensing	Vision	83.95580049385167	-61.7091900260958	151151
31d8fbfac85f253b7f381313ba2e1ccc4a97aa43	modelling forest canopy height by integrating airborne lidar samples with satellite radar and multispectral imagery		Spatially-explicit information on forest structure is paramount to estimating aboveground carbon stocks for designing sustainable forest management strategies and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. LiDAR measurements provide samples of forest structure that must be integrated with satellite imagery to predict and to map landscape scale variations of forest structure. Here we evaluate the capability of existing satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) with multispectral data to estimate forest canopy height over five study sites across two biomes in North America, namely temperate broadleaf and mixed forests and temperate coniferous forests. Pixel size affected the modelling results, with an improvement in model performance as pixel resolution coarsened from 25 m to 100 m. Likewise, the sample size was an important factor in the uncertainty of height prediction using the Support Vector Machine modelling approach. Larger sample size yielded better results but the improvement stabilised when the sample size reached approximately 10% of the study area. We also evaluated the impact of surface moisture (soil and vegetation moisture) on the modelling approach. Whereas the impact of surface moisture had a moderate effect on the proportion of the variance explained by the model (up to 14%), its impact was more evident in the bias of the models with bias reaching values up to 4 m. Averaging the incidence angle corrected radar backscatter coefficient (γ°) reduced the impact of surface moisture on the models and improved their performance at all study sites, with R ranging between 0.61 and 0.82, RMSE between 2.02 and 5.64 and bias between 0.02 and −0.06, respectively, at 100 m spatial resolution. An evaluation of the relative importance of the variables in the model performance showed that for the study sites located within the temperate broadleaf and mixed forests biome ALOS-PALSAR HV polarised backscatter was the most important variable, with Landsat Tasselled Cap Transformation components barely contributing to the models for two of the study sites whereas it had a significant contribution at the third one. Over the temperate conifer forests, Landsat Tasselled Cap variables contributed more than the ALOSPALSAR HV band to predict the landscape height variability. In all cases, incorporation of multispectral data improved the retrieval of forest canopy height and reduced the estimation uncertainty for tall forests. Finally, we concluded that models trained at one study site had higher uncertainty when applied to other sites, but a model developed from multiple sites performed equally to site-specific models to predict forest canopy height. This result suggest that a biome level model developed from several study sites can be used as a reliable estimator of biome-level forest structure from existing satellite imagery.

31c54a2b7bc461019bcf273b5b8269cc7e697a9c	using satellite-borne remote sensing data in generating local warming maps with enhanced resolution		Warming, i.e., increments of temperature, is evident at the global, regional, and local level. However, understanding the dynamics of local warming at high spatial resolution remains challenging. In fact, it is very common to see extremely variable land cover/land use within built-up environments that create micro-climatic conditions. To address this issue, our overall goal was to generate a local warming map for the period 1961–2010 at 15 m spatial resolution over the southern part of the Canadian province of Alberta. Our proposed methods consisted of three distinct steps. These were the: (i) construction of high spatial resolution enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) maps; (ii) conversion of air temperature (Ta) normal (i.e., 30 years average) at higher spatial resolution using vegetation indices (VI); and (iii) generation of a local warming map at 15m spatial resolution. In order to execute this study, we employed MODIS-driven air temperature data, EVI and NDVI data, and Landsat-driven vegetation indices. The study uncovered that around 58% (up to positive 1 °C) of areas in the considered study region were experiencing increased temperature; whereas only about 4% of areas underwent a cooling trend (more than negative 0.25 °C). The remaining 38% did not exhibit significant change in temperature. We concluded that remote sensing technology could be useful to enhance the spatial resolution of local warming maps, which would be useful for decision-makers considering efficient decisions in the face of increments in local temperature.

Due to its temperature, mass of stored water (and related thermal inertia) and position, it influences the atmosphere and marine circulations. Despite of its importance, Antarctica is the most unexplored region of Earth. The knowledge about the Antarctic environment is very limited due to its impervious conditions which hamper the human exploration. In this context remote sensing techniques helps in filling the gap. As pointed out in some preliminary works [1][2], microwave brightness temperature data can be useful for estimating snow sub-surface and air temperature. The aim of this paper is to extend previous studies by using AWS and AMSR-E data collected daily for 6 years for estimating snow and air temperature over the East Antarctic plateau. We assessed that the snow sub-surface temperature can be estimated by using linear regressions with a R2 between satellite and ground data greater than 0.9 (the retrieval RMSE obtained is around 1K), while the determination coefficient of the relationships between the air and brightness temperatures was found to be around 0.7 (the associated retrieval RMSE varies between 2K and 7K).	amazon web services;coefficient;ecosystem;microwave	Marco Brogioni;Giovanni Macelloni;Simone Pettinato;Francesco Montomoli	2011	2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6050073	meteorology;atmospheric sciences;temperature;linear regression;climate change;physics;statistics;remote sensing	Mobile	84.65582469745743	-62.66037649883989	151518

The underlying hypothesis comes to assume that the local variations of the SST relate to the surface currents. Ocean turbulence models, such as the Surface Quasi Geostrophic (SQG) theory (cf. [2], [3]) or statistical methods like neural networks (cf. [4]) or latent class regressions (cf. [5]) provide different means to state the SST-SSH relationships. This later approach has the advantage to be completely parametric and to account for different transfer functions between SST and SSH. It relies on a conditional setting with respect to a hidden variable related to different dynamical modes at the surface of the ocean. In this paper, we aim at further developing such latent models with an emphasis on two aspects: (i) the modeling and learning of the spatio-temporal dynamics of the hidden dynamical modes using Markovian priors, (ii) the reconstruction of daily SSH fields from a joint analysis of microwave SST and altimetry observation series. We evaluate the proposed model both qualitatively and quantitatively with respect to the reference altimetry product.	artificial neural network;hidden surface determination;hidden variable theory;microwave;transfer function;turbulence modeling	Pierre Tandeo;Ronan Fablet;Pierre Ailliot	2014	2014 IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2014.6947650	meteorology;climatology;remote sensing	Vision	87.99742496123277	-63.23417653560156	152232

In contrast, the volume of crop production hasn't been keeping up with human population's uptrend. Major fall in crop production is a typical result of recurring agricultural droughts. To be able to predict such crop failures, a drought monitoring system at global scale is required. For this reason, a new project named Global Agricultural Drought Monitoring and Forecasting System (GADMFS) kicked off earlier in 2011. Our drought maps indicated multiple agricultural droughts in varying severities across the globe such as persistent extreme drought in Texas, US and short-term drought around Western Europe enclosing Germany, Luxembourg and France. The results from other sources such as US Drought Monitor (USDM) and European commission Joint Research Center Institute (JRC) for Environment and Sustainability (IES) confirmed our findings. In conclusion, accurate satellite vegetation indices are invaluable source for drought monitoring applications.	global positioning system;map	Ali Levent Yagci;Liping Di;Meixia Deng;Genong Yu;Chunming Peng	2012	2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6350498	crop;normalized difference vegetation index;geology;hydrology;remote sensing	Embedded	83.80264167279759	-57.55913073662974	152566

Comparisons of predictions are made with the data of Yoshida et al. for a Re = 10,000 flow, with good agreement found in both the free and wall jet regions. Some under-prediction, particularly by the RANS approach, of turbulence quantities is apparent, and overall the LES is clearly in closer agreement with data, particularly in zones where large turbulence structures dominate. Differences in LES and RANS for the particular flow considered are not large, however, and this may be attributed to the significant effort already expended in the development of second-moment turbulence closures with wall reflection effects for impinging flow application. The results presented go some way towards validating LES for application to impinging flows, although uncertainties in the data set used for comparison purposes demonstrate a requirement for further experimental work.	large eddy simulation	S.

The joint x–y distances sample set partitioning (SPXY) method was applied to divided all samples into calibration set (70 pears) and prediction set (35 pears). Nineteen and 13 characteristic variables were extracted for SSC and firmness, respectively, from the full dielectric spectra by using successive projection algorithm. The nonlinear model, i.e., least squares support vector machine, extreme learning machine (ELM) and generalized regression neural network, and linear models, i.e., multiple linear regression and partial least squares regression, were used to establish SSC and firmness determination models based on the full dielectric spectra and extracted characteristic variables by SPA. Results showed that SPA-ELM was the best model for SSC and firmness prediction, with the correlation coefficient and rootmean-square error of prediction set of 0.838 and 0.464 for SSC, and of 0.865 and 0.362 for firmness. The study indicates that dielectric spectroscopy combined with artificial neural network might be applied in developing portable SSC and firmness detectors of intact pears during on-tree ripening. 2015 Elsevier B.V.

CP consists of transmitting a single polarization while receiving two polarizations. At longer wavelengths, one of the main challenges associated with CP from space is Faraday rotation (FR) estimation and correction. In this paper, an estimation procedure for FR is presented, which relies on the scattering properties of bare surfaces. The selection of the bare surfaces is based on a new parameter, the conformity coefficient computed from CP measurements. This parameter is shown to be FR invariant. Once estimated, the FR can be corrected over the whole image. A simple approximation to sigmaHH o and sigmaVV o based on CP measurements over bare soil surfaces is presented, from which soil moisture can be estimated using the 1995 Dubois algorithm. The results obtained using CP are shown to be in good agreement with those obtained from the standard Dubois algorithm using fully polarimetric data. This implies that, for soil moisture, CP can be used instead of HH and VV dual-polarized measurements.	algorithm;approximation;coefficient;conformity;estimation theory;faraday cage;faraday effect;polarimetry;polarization (waves);transmitter;verification and validation	My-Linh Truong-Loï;Anthony Freeman;Pascale Dubois-Fernandez;Eric Pottier	2009	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2009.2031428	polarization;hydrology;optics;faraday effect;physics;remote sensing	Visualization	83.76174026406647	-64.90013159113954	154354

This analysis uses a large database of TerraSAR-X images and in situ measurements (soil moisture “mv” and surface roughness “ h_rms”). Oh's model correctly simulates the radar signal for HH and VV polarizations, whereas the simulations performed with the Dubois model show a poor correlation between TerraSAR-X data and model. The backscattering IEM simulates correctly the backscattering coefficient only for h_rms <; 1.5 cm in using an exponential correlation function and for h_rms >; 1.5 cm in using Gaussian function. However, the results are not satisfactory for the use of IEM in the inversion of TerraSAR-X data. A semiempirical calibration of IEM was done in X-band. Good agreement was found between the TerraSAR-X data and the simulations using the calibrated version of the IEM.	coefficient;integrated enterprise modeling;ku band;radar;semi-empirical quantum chemistry method;simulation;synthetic data;time complexity;verification and validation	Nicolas Baghdadi;Elie Saba;Maelle Aubert;Mehrez Zribi;Frédéric Baup	2011	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2011.2158982	meteorology;moisture;data modeling;synthetic aperture radar;surface roughness;water content;hydrology;correlation;backscatter;physics;radar;remote sensing	Visualization	84.43777694305558	-65.04486968111485	154378

81b94210d4ea35cd2e8dcfdb72476d408418a2ba	retrieval of fuel moisture content from himawari-8 product: towards real-time wildfire risk assessment		Fuel moisture content (FMC) is a critical factor in assessing wildfire risk and its behaviour. Traditional field measurement of this variable is time-consuming and is impossible to extend to large-scale and dynamic applications. The canopy water has strong absorption characteristic in near and shortwave infrared spectra, allowing the near-real-time, multi-temporal and -spatial estimation of the FMC from remotely sensed data available. During last decade, numerous statistic- or physical model-based studies were carried out for the estimation of this variable. As FMC is responsive to weather variations, diurnal determination of this variable is essential for wildfire early-warning. With the launch of Himawari-8 in 2014, 10 mins images are available from this satellite, making real-time retrieval of the FMC achievable. Thus, this is the first study to retrieve diurnal FMC from Himawari-8 images, with the purpose for real-time wildfire risk assessment in near future.	flight management system;fundamental modeling concepts;motorola canopy;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;risk assessment;software release life cycle	Xingwen Quan;Binbin He;Marta Yebra;X X Liu;Xiaofang Liu;Xiaodong Zhang;Hui Cao	2018	IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8517602	remote sensing;risk management;shortwave;moisture;statistic;computer science;risk assessment;water content	Vision	83.3586190429955	-58.24864580216195	154977

This paper extends previous studies by considering a time series data cube retrieval algorithm and measurements in the presence of vegetation. Vegetation information is assumed to be provided by an ancillary data source in the retrieval process. The performance of an algorithm for reconstructing FP information from CP measurements of vegetated soil surfaces is also examined. The results of the study show that only a modest degradation in soil moisture retrieval performance occurs when compact-pol measurements are used in place of full-pol data.	algorithm;data cube;elegant degradation;polarimetry;radar;simulation;systems design;time series	Jeffrey D.

This sensitivity is rooted in the well differentiated emission properties of calm water with respect to non-flooded land of any kind. In this paper, AMSR-E observations of an herbaceous wetland area on the Paraná River sub-basin were analyzed during the 2009–10 timeframe when this region was affected by a strong and long lasting flooding. Evident effects on the difference between vertically and horizontally polarized brightness temperatures (ΔT) were observed at C-band. The fraction of vegetated flooded area was estimated by applying an improved algorithm which uses ENVISAT ASAR data at specific dates to calibrate AMSR-E temporal series. Also, using a theoretical emission model, the behavior of ΔT flooded is discussed.	algorithm;calm technology;microwave;molecular orbital;polarization (waves);whole earth 'lectronic link	Mercedes Salvia;Francisco Grings;Pablo Perna;Paolo Ferrazzoli;Rachid Rahmoune;Matias Barber;Vanesa Douna;Haydee Karszenbaum	2010	2010 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5652836	meteorology;estimation;wetland;radiometry;sensitivity;hydrology;brightness temperature;physics;vegetation;remote sensing	Embedded	83.36111473707021	-59.54403050054807	155558
d05e2584b07cd70b7edcd5a96649921bf109d952	intercomparison and validation of modis and glass leaf area index (lai) products over mountain areas: a case study in southwestern china	leaf area index;mountain areas;glass;modis;validation	The validation study of leaf area index (LAI) products over rugged surfaces not only gives additional insights into data quality of LAI products, but deepens understanding of uncertainties regarding land surface process models depended on LAI data over complex terrain. This study evaluated the performance of MODIS and GLASS LAI products using the intercomparison and direct validation methods over southwestern China. The spatio-temporal consistencies, such as the spatial distributions of LAI products and their statistical relationship as a function of topographic indices, time, and vegetation types, respectively, were investigated through intercomparison between MODIS and GLASS products during the period 2011–2013. The accuracies and change ranges of these two products were evaluated against available LAI reference maps over 10 sampling regions which standed for typical vegetation types and topographic gradients in southwestern China.#R##N##R##N#The results show that GLASS LAI exhibits higher percentage of good quality data (i.e. successful retrievals) and smoother temporal profiles than MODIS LAI. The percentage of successful retrievals for MODIS and GLASS is vulnerable to topographic indices, especially to relief amplitude. Besides, the two products do not capture seasonal dynamics of crop, especially in spring over heterogeneously hilly regions. The yearly mean LAI differences between MODIS and GLASS are within ±0.5 for 64.70% of the total retrieval pixels over southwestern China. The spatial distribution of mean differences and temporal profiles of these two products are inclined to be dominated by vegetation types other than topographic indices. The spatial and temporal consistency of these two products is good over most area of grasses/cereal crops; however, it is poor for evergreen broadleaf forest. MODIS presents more reliable change range of LAI than GLASS through comparison with fine resolution reference maps over most of sampling regions. The accuracies of direct validation are obtained for GLASS LAI (r = 0.35, RMSE = 1.72, mean bias = −0.71) and MODIS LAI (r = 0.49, RMSE = 1.75, mean bias = −0.67). GLASS performs similarly to MODIS, but may be marginally inferior to MODIS based on our direct validation results. The validation experience demonstrates the necessity and importance of topographic consideration for LAI estimation over mountain areas. Considerable attention will be paid to the improvements of surface reflectance, retrieval algorithm and land cover types so as to enhance the quality of LAI products in topographically complex terrain.	glass	Huaan Jin;Ainong Li;Jinhu Bian;Xi Nan;Wei Zhao;Zhengjian Zhang;Gaofei Yin	2017	Int.

Two models: (i) Watershed Modeling System for predicting hydrographs and (ii) TuFlow comprised of hydrodynamic model of a one-dimensional river flow and a two-dimensional surface flow model for floodplain delineation were coupled to determine flood risks in the basins of Rize province. A 100-year flood peak discharges are computed based on the historical records and generated records in relation to climate change scenarios using grid-based approach. The influences of resolution of the mesh-size with the same DEM data on automated floodplain delineation are also another concern to investigate in this study. The results of this study could be used in quantitative flood risk assessments in the design of municipal infrastructures in the region. The results of this study showed that _ Iyidere River flooded during the both present and future (tied with three climate change scenarios) conditions and seemed to need rehabilitation whereas Ça glayan and Tahiro glu rivers flooded only in present condition. Our investigation also showed that coarse grid resolutions might cause overestimation in the floodplain and water depth. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

12fe1650674772d2aeda8410751d87c2b37b5c55	ocean and geothermal energy systems		This paper presents techno–economic summaries of ocean wave, tidal and current, ocean thermal, and geothermal energy, including grid interface characteristics. These forms of energy represent a significant opportunity to complement diversified energy conversion portfolios. Ocean wave energy conversion relies on the capture of kinetic and potential energy in moving and elevated water in an ocean wave. Tidal and current technology converts the kinetic energy in moving water, much like a wind turbine. Ocean thermal converts the energy available in the temperature gradient of warm surface water and cold deep water. Last, geothermal conversion utilizes the hot rock and water deep within the Earth. The total global average wave resource is estimated at approximately 2000 GW, with approximately 300 GW in the United States. The total global tidal resource is estimated at approximately 1000 GW, with 50 GW in the United States. The marine current resource estimate for the Florida Current in the southeast United States is estimated at 5 GW. Ocean thermal has a global capacity estimate of 5000 GW. Last, the global conventional hydrothermal geothermal capacity estimate is approximately 200 GW, but with much more possible through enhanced geothermal systems. For cost, it was found that the long-term projected wave energy conversion cost is $0.10–0.15/kWh. The long-term projected tidal cost is found to be $0.025–0.25/kWh. Ocean thermal long-term cost is projected at $0.10–0.18/kWh. And last, geothermal, being more closely aligned with traditional thermal generation, is estimated at $0.03/kWh to $0.15/kWh.	gw-basic;gradient	Annette von Jouanne;Ted K. A.

Reclaimed water derived in spring or summer could be applied irrigating in some arid region, which have been considered a rational renewable resource of water. Yet in winter, reclaimed water would run off into river or stream in vain. The idea of storing it in winter and being ready for the next year's irrigation is proposed, however, the effects on crops are maintained sealed. Experiments processed using raw sewage, primary treated water, and secondary treated water in Gaobeidian Sewage Plant of Beijing to irrigate maize and soybean in spring and summer from 2006 to 2007, based on which the irrigation effect derived from reclaimed water of winter was predicted by ANN. The results validated the strong relations between irrigation effect and qualities of water, which indicated the reclaimed water stored in winter was grossly similar to secondary treated water in summer for irrigation.	arid;experiment	Jinfeng Deng	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-18336-2_25	environmental science;water resource management;hydrology;agronomy;deficit irrigation;farm water	AI	85.51307390520324	-56.091018580550305	157695

Recent improvements to our three dimensional radiative transfer model of a vegetated surface are described. Example simulation results and a validation exercise are discussed. The model was utilized to derive land cover specific NDVI–LAI and NDVI–FAPAR relations. The method therefore requires stratification of global vegetation into cover types that are compatible with the radiative transfer model. Such a classification based on vegetation structure is proposed and a simple method for its derivation is presented. Proof-of-concept results are given to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed method.	simulation	Ranga B. Myneni;Ramakrishna Ramakrishna;Ramakrishna R. Nemani;Steven W. Running	1997	IEEE Trans.

The study accounts for forecast uncertainties stemming from the meteorological forcing and hydrological model uncertainty. Multi-model estimation from three hydrological models, each forced with an ensemble of forcing derived by matching observed analogues of forecasted quartile rainfall anomalies from a seasonal climate forecast is used. The attained useful hydrological prediction skill is despite the climate model overestimating rainfall by over 23% over these SEUS watersheds in December-May period. The prediction skill in the month of April and May is deteriorated as compared to the period from December-March (zero lead forecast). A nutrient streamflow rating curve is developed using a log linear tool for this purpose. The skill in the prediction of seasonal nutrient loading is identical to the skill of seasonal streamflow forecast. We present ensemble hydrological forecasting method that accounts for the uncertainty in hydrological models.We evaluate the skill of seasonal hydrological and water quality prediction using both deterministic and probabilistic skill scores.The study emphasis the importance of bias correction in climate product for hydrological application.

Two PCA models are examined: a model with isotropic noise and a model which takes into account data uncertainty due to sampling errors. Inference is done by variational Bayesian learning. The methods are compared with a more traditional technique, reduced space optimal interpolation (RSOI), that is currently used in producing standard historical SST analyses. New methods were applied to the MOHSST5, an observational data set for 1856–1991 period from the United Kingdom Meteorological Office, that was used in a previously published application of the RSOI. Data uncertainty specification was also identical to the one used in that RSOI application, hence the performances of all reconstructions are directly comparable. Reconstruction results for 1982–1991 period are tested via their comparison with the NOAA monthly 1° OI (version 2) that blends in situ observations with the much better sampled satellite data. New reconstructions slightly outperform the published RSOI reconstruction in this test and suggest that further improvements are possible.	interpolation;performance;principal component analysis;sampling (signal processing);variational principle	Alexander Ilin;Alexey Kaplan	2009	2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks	10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178744	econometrics;sea surface temperature;statistics	Vision	86.40329199751774	-61.84253145004981	158492
384027e5803901c758c5703f3dee8a54d8f2b65d	error characterization of soil moisture satellite products: retrieving error cross-correlation through extended quadruple collocation		The triple collocation (TC) technique is being increasingly used to validate soil moisture retrievals derived from different systems, like satellites, hydrological models, or in situ probes. In recent years, several extensions of this method were proposed in order to evaluate the error standard deviations of more than three systems and to soften the TC hypothesis. In this paper, a novel extended quadruple collocation (E-QC) method is proposed, in order to consider the possibility of a cross correlation between product errors, identifying automatically the couple of error cross-correlated systems. The method is applicable even to a larger number of collocated datasets, although it may be unfeasible to collect them in practice. A synthetic experiment showed promising results, concluding that the E-QC is able to individuate (if any) the pair of systems with cross-correlated errors. It correctly compensates for the latter contribution and accurately retrieves error standard deviations of each system, otherwise biased if cross correlation is not taken into account. The E-QC was applied to soil moisture retrievals provided by satellite (SMOS, ASCAT, and SMAP), model (ERA Interim), and in situ probes (ISMN). The E-QC method identified the presence of error cross-correlation between the satellite products. This was also confirmed by analyzing the five datasets all together. E-QC showed fair performances of satellite products, especially of SMAP, although not as good as in case the presence of error correlation is not correctly taken into account.	collocation;cross-correlation;greater than;international standard music number;isosorbide mononitrate;large;performance;quadruple-precision floating-point format;satellite viruses;selective calling;synthetic intelligence;triple negative breast neoplasms	Nazzareno Pierdicca;Fabio Fascetti;Luca Pulvirenti;Raffaele Crapolicchio	2017	IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing	10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2714025	measurement uncertainty;cross-correlation;remote sensing;standard deviation;mathematics;satellite;water content;collocation	Visualization	85.1558288668927	-63.67976445895709	159002
4fd9c56e9e25b52623fd77310bfd5a64ca2ab734	estimating fractional vegetation cover and the vegetation index of bare soil and highly dense vegetation with a physically based method	ndvi of highly dense vegetation ndvi v;normalized difference vegetation index ndvi;fractional vegetation cover fvc;ndvi of bare soil ndvi s;linear mixture model	Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of highly dense vegetation (NDVIv) and bare soil (NDVIs), identified as the key parameters for Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) estimation, are usually obtained with empirical statistical methods However, it is often difficult to obtain reasonable values of NDVIv and NDVIs at a coarse resolution (e.g., 1 km), or in arid, semiarid, and evergreen areas. The uncertainty of estimated NDVIs and NDVIv can cause substantial errors in FVC estimations when a simple linear mixture model is used. To address this problem, this paper proposes a physically based method. The leaf area index (LAI) and directional NDVI are introduced in a gap fraction model and a linear mixture model for FVC estimation to calculate NDVIv and NDVIs. The model incorporates the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model parameters product (MCD43B1) and LAI product, which are convenient to acquire. Two types of evaluation experiments are designed 1) with data simulated by a canopy radiative transfer model and 2) with satellite observations. The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) for simulated data is less than 0.117, depending on the type of noise added on the data. In the real data experiment, the RMSD for cropland is 0.127, for grassland is 0.075, and for forest is 0.107. The experimental areas respectively lack fully vegetated and non-vegetated pixels at 1 km resolution. Consequently, a relatively large uncertainty is found while using the statistical methods and the RMSD ranges from 0.110 to 0.363 based on the real data. The proposed method is convenient to produce NDVIv and NDVIs maps for FVC estimation on regional and global scales.		Wanjuan Song;Xihan Mu;Gaiyan Ruan;Zhan Gao;Linyuan Li;Guangjian Yan	2017	Int. J.

The driving forces determining the changes were also analysed. Overall, the results show that the causes of deforestation were the economic factors, namely agriculture intensification, and population dynamics, related to the process of urbanization. However, deforestation statistics shows only a total of 10 percent decrease; it is the degradation of the remaining forest that is the major concern. Knowledge on deforestation and its driving forces in Selangor is very important as it provides the basis for the calculation of the total amount of carbon stock above ground. It also gives insight into the appropriate intervention measures that can be taken to increase carbon stock, thus reducing the release of carbon dioxide emission to the atmosphere.	elegant degradation;population dynamics	Sharifah Mastura Syed Abdullah	2012	2012 4th Conference on Data Mining and Optimization (DMO)	10.1109/DMO.2012.6329789	carbon;agriculture;carbon dioxide;deforestation;spatial analysis;earth;data analysis;vegetation;statistics	DB	83.4311820612448	-56.66111274906561	159143
9c28c65956a7e31ecf291b4edd385640a55f2341	estimating total aboveground, stem and branch biomass using multi-frequency sar		We have investigated the retrieval of total aboveground, stem and branch biomass using multi-temporal SAR data acquired at C-, L-, and P-band by Radarsat-2, ERS-2, ALOS PALSAR, and SETHI for a forest site in Sweden. A semi-empirical model was used to model C- and L-band backscatter as function of total aboveground, stem and branch biomass; a linear regression model was used for P-band. Calibrated with the aid of inventory plots, the models were used to estimate total aboveground, stem, and branch biomass for each individual scene in the multi-temporal and multi-frequency stack of observations. Individual estimates were then combined using weights reflecting each scenes' sensitivity to the biomass component in question. At the plot scale, the retrieval errors were 37, 40, and 33 % for total aboveground, stem, and branch biomass in terms of the relative RMSE; the error further reduced to 33, 38, and 27 % when calibrating models per species. We find that i) the retrieval of total aboveground, stem and branch biomass benefits from the availability of multi-temporal/-frequency data as the lowest retrieval errors with the best single image (P-band) were about 6 to 8 % higher, ii) there is no benefit in estimating total aboveground biomass via independent estimates of stem and branch biomass, iii) consideration of species specific differences associated with different allocations of biomass to stems and branches allows for improving the retrieval.	autostereogram;l band;semiconductor industry	Oliver Cartus;Maurizio Santoro;Urs Wegmüller;Björn Rommen	2017	2017 9th International Workshop on the Analysis of Multitemporal Remote Sensing Images (MultiTemp)	10.1109/Multi-Temp.2017.8035231	statistics;linear regression;synthetic aperture radar;remote sensing;geography;mean squared error;biomass	Vision	85.1398028129377	-60.020555311219546	159565

baaf63e549238b98144a7640a86a901dd11353b9	remote sensing assessment of forest disturbance across complex mountainous terrain: the pattern and severity of impacts of tropical cyclone yasi on australian rainforests	forest disturbance;tropical cyclones;multispectral data;tropical rainforests;complex mountainous terrain	Topography affects the patterns of forest disturbance produced by tropical cyclones. It determines the degree of exposure of a surface and can alter wind characteristics. Whether multispectral remote sensing data can sense the effect of topography on disturbance is a question that deserves attention given the multi-scale spatial coverage of these data and the projected increase in intensity of the strongest cyclones. Here, multispectral satellite data, topographic maps and cyclone surface wind data were used to study the patterns of disturbance in an Australian rainforest with complex mountainous terrain produced by tropical cyclone Yasi (2011). The cyclone surface wind data (H*wind) was produced by the Hurricane Research Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (HRD/NOAA), and this was the first time that this data was produced for a cyclone outside of United States territory. A disturbance map was obtained by applying spectral mixture analyses on satellite data and presented a significant correlation with field-measured tree mortality. Our results showed that, consistent with cyclones in the southern hemisphere, multispectral data revealed that forest disturbance was higher on the left side of the cyclone track. The highest level of forest disturbance occurred in forests along the path of the cyclone track (±30). Levels of forest disturbance decreased with decreasing slope and with an aspect facing off the track of the cyclone or away from the dominant surface winds. An increase in disturbance with surface elevation was also observed. However, areas affected by the same wind intensity presented increased levels of disturbance with increasing elevation suggesting that complex terrain interactions act to speed up wind at higher elevations. Yasi produced an important offset to Australia’s forest carbon sink in 2010. We concluded that multispectral data was sensitive to the main effects of complex topography on disturbance patterns. High resolution cyclone wind surface data are needed in order to quantify the effects of topographic accelerations on cyclone related forest disturbances.	ecosystem;image resolution;interaction;multispectral image;real-time transcription;topography;tropical cyclone track forecasting	Robinson I.

The current work uses an alternative hypothesis of a linear groundwater system with a continuing inflow from the vadose zone. This leads to the development of recession equations with time-varying inputs of various forms. Comparison of these and the ‘no recharge’ models, using data from 22 Australian benchmark catchments, leads to the conclusion that significant recharge does continue through recession periods, and should be accounted for in conceptual models of the rainfall-runoff process. While the initial value of the recharge is closely related to the stream flow, the time constants for all the models vary widely between events, which led to the development of master recession curves. The recession equation of the IHACRES model, which takes the form of the sum of two exponential functions, was found to provide a very good fit to the data. Evaporation and seepage losses can be incorporated in the recession equation, and the magnitude of the losses can be quantified.	recession cone	Tom G.

However, TES is essentially a typical nondeterministic inverse problem. From the late 1990's, a number of TES algorithms for hyperspectral TIR data have been developed based on various additional constrains. In this paper, different hyperspectral TIR TES methods, including spectral smoothness methods, downwelling radiance residual index (DRRI) method and linear spectral emissivity constraint (LSEC) method, were first recalled. Subsequently, the simulated hyperspectral TIR data were used to evaluate the performance of the TES method. The results shows that spectral smoothness method and DRRI method perform similarly, while the LSEC method may have better performance to retrieve land surface temperature and emissivity.	advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer;algorithm;stellar classification	Ning Wang;Xinhong Wang;Lingling Ma;Yonggang Qian;Lingli Tang;Chuanrong Li	2012	2012 4th Workshop on Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing (WHISPERS)	10.1109/WHISPERS.2012.6874303	geography;hydrology;optics;remote sensing	Graphics	84.97339729104078	-62.49800975308956	160499

The increasing role that air quality models play in air quality management requires comparison between model results and previous observations in order to determine the capacity of the model to reproduce past events. The CHIMERE chemistry-transport model has been used by several research groups to estimate air pollutant concentrations in different European countries. An evaluation of the model performance of the CHIMERE air quality model was carried out for the spring and summer periods of 2003–2005 in Spain, using EMEP emissions. This evaluation has demonstrated a fair agreement between observed and modelled ozone values for background stations, with a mean normalized absolute error below 15% for rural background air quality sites. This value lays inside the range proposed in EPA’s guideline for an acceptable level of model performance. In spite of this acceptable model performance, further studies need to be carried out to explain some underestimation found over Madrid surroundings. 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The results show that, at the leaf scale, the variations in chlorophyll a+b content, the leaf structure parameter, and the water content dominate the reflectance variance in the visible light (VIS), near infrared (NIR), and short-wave infrared (SWIR) regions, respectively. At the canopy scale, the sensitivity of reflectance to variation in the leaf structure parameter is very slight. For sparse foliage cover (leaf area index ), LAI is the most important variable to the canopy reflectance. As LAI increases, the sensitivity of reflectance to variation in LAI is reduced to a very low value. Moreover, chlorophyll a+b, dry matter, and water content control the variation of canopy reflectance in the VIS, NIR, and SWIR regions, respectively. At the regional scale, the sensitivity of reflectance to variation in vegetation variables is highly influenced by the mixed pixels. Thirty-six vegetation indices (VIs) are chosen in this paper to illustrate the scale dependence of the estimation accuracy of vegetation variables. The results show that the relationships between the VIs and the variables highly depend on the observation scale. For chlorophyll a+b content estimation, transformed chlorophyll absorption in reflectance index (TCARI), Blue Green pigment Index, leaf chlorophyll index (LCI), modified Normalized Difference (mND705), and Plant Biochemical Index at the leaf scale and canopy scale of and TCARI at the canopy scale of are highly related. The correlation between the indices and chlorophyll content in the regional scale is, however, much lower. For water content estimation, disease water stress index (DSWI), leaf water vegetation index 2 (LWVI_2), moisture stress index (MSI), normalized difference infrared index (NDII), normalized difference water index (NDWI), hyperspectral perpendicular vegetation index (RVI), SWIR water stress index (SIWSI), SR water index (SRWI), and water index (WI) are good choices at the leaf scale and canopy scale of , while at the canopy scale of and the regional scale, the correlation between the indices and water content is very low. For LAI estimation, VIs, including the Greenness Index, simple ratio (SR), Normalized Difference VI, modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI), modified triangular vegetation index 1 (MTVI1), modified triangular vegetation index 2 (MTVI2), optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), modified chlorophyll absorption ratio index 1 (MCARI1), modified chlorophyll absorption ratio index 2 (MCARI2), Enhanced VI, LAI Determining Index, renormalized difference vegetation index (RDVI), Spectral Polygon VI, Wide Dynamic Range VI, and triangular vegetation index (TVI), have high correlation with LAI at the canopy scale of while a low correlation at the canopy scale of and the regional scale.	dynamic range;inverted index;light-on-dark color scheme;liquid contact indicator;motorola canopy;pigment;pixel;second level address translation;sparse matrix;televideo	Yanfang Xiao;Wenji Zhao;Demin Zhou;Huili Gong	2014	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2013.2278838	absorption;radiative transfer;enhanced vegetation index;database index;scale;water;estimation;water content;sensitivity;hydrology;pigment;leaf area index;sensitivity analysis;physics;vegetation;statistics;remote sensing	Vision	85.74038477972343	-59.79849378641775	160590

The study results showed that:(1) the main landscape of the study area was dominated by dry land and woodland, the proportion of dry land could get to 36.3% and woodland was 21.2% of the total area; (2) the landscape pattern analysis of Gongyi by the moving window method showed that the study area had four landscape diversity centers, which were urban built-up areas, southeastern hilly region, low mountains in the south region and the northern part of the valley plains agricultural areas; (3) different landscape pattern showed significant spatial heterogeneity along the transects, the window radius of 1000m was proved to best retain the gradient characteristics and explicitly reflect the spatial changes when compared with the other window radius; (4) at the landscape level, the maximum landscape shape index and landscape diversity index were mainly occurred in the range of 4-6km distance from the city center of Gongyi City. The fragmentation degree of the southeastern suburbs was much weaker than the southwestern suburbs in the study area. This was mainly because of less human disturbances in southwestern suburbs of Gongyi City. The study results were supposed to be meaningful and important for the sustainable use of land resources, and also for the landscape planning and management in the study area.	fragmentation (computing);geographic information system;gradient;pattern recognition	Linghua Kong;Shengyan Ding;Guofu Liang;Qian Tang;Xunling Lu	2013	2013 21st International Conference on Geoinformatics	10.1109/Geoinformatics.2013.6626190	geography;forestry;cartography	Robotics	82.96845215358903	-55.21445201049215	160601

A single-hidden-layer artificial neural network (ANN) was employed to accomplish this remote sensing task, with radiometric observations of brightness temperatures (Tbs) as input data, to derive information about snow. Error backpropagation learning was applied to train the ANN. After learning the mapping of SSM/I Tbs to snow classes, the ANN approach showed a significant promise for identifying mountainous snow conditions. Error rates were 3% for snow-free, 5% for dry snow, 9% for wet snow, and 0% for refrozen snow, respectively. This study indicates the potential of ANN supervised learning for the inference of snow conditions from SSM/I observations. Further improvement on the application of ANN for large-scale snow monitoring can be expected by using more training data derived from both plains and mountain regions.	artificial neural network	Changyi Sun;Heng-Da Cheng;Jeffrey J.

94e101dd697791a5aa8143e876bc705c1a4945a7	forecasting monthly streamflow dynamics in the western united states: a nonlinear dynamical approach	prediction method;low flow;chaotic behavior;phase space;multi dimensional;phase space reconstruction;nonlinear dynamics;streamflow;western united states;local approximation prediction;flow regime	An attempt is made in the present study to understand the dynamics of monthly streamflow in the western United States from a nonlinear dynamical perspective. For this purpose, streamflow data observed at 79 stations across 11 states in the western United States are analyzed. A nonlinear prediction method with a local approximation approach is employed. The method uses the concept of phase-space reconstruction to represent the underlying dynamics, i.e. reconstruction of the single-dimensional (or variable) streamflow series in a multi-dimensional phase-space. The analysis is carried out by grouping the 79 stations under three categories, on the basis of the magnitude of (mean) streamflow, as: (1) low-flow stations, having mean streamflow values less than 2.832 m 3 /s; (2) high-flow stations, having mean streamflow values more than 28.32 m 3 /s; and (3) medium-flow stations, having mean streamflow values between 2.832 and 28.32 m 3 /s. Detailed analyses and results are presented only for three stations, selected to represent the low-flow, medium-flow, and high-flow categories, respectively. The results indicate that the local approximation prediction approach yields, in general, reasonably good predictions of streamflow dynamics irrespective of the flow regime, but the predictions for the low-flow stations are found to be relatively better than that obtained for the medium-flow and high-flow stations. These results seem to suggest the possible presence of chaotic behavior in the monthly streamflow dynamics in the western United States. Studies to verify and support the present results are underway.	nonlinear system	Bellie Sivakumar	2003	Environmental Modelling and Software	10.1016/S1364-8152(03)00074-4	meteorology;nonlinear system;geology;hydrology;climatology;phase space;streamflow	SE	87.81562617566838	-56.70556936703976	161180

This paper constitutes a pilot study for the accurate estimation of meteorological values at a target location employing the meteorological measurements collected at a nearby (reference) location. Artificial neural networks are investigated and compared with traditional estimation methods such as linear models of first and higher orders and the non-linear model. The significance of the improvement obtained via the estimation--and especially the artificial neural network approach--over simply considering the measurements at the reference location is demonstrated in a number of energy applications.	approximation algorithm;artificial neural network;dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry;emoticon;energy systems language;estimated;exposure to humidity;fr 139317;file spanning;fourier analysis;greater than;linear model;nl (complexity);nonlinear system;numerical aperture;population parameter;projections and predictions;radiation;smoothing (statistical technique);sodium;stationary process;status epilepticus;systems design;unit per liter;benefit;orders - hl7publishingdomain	Tatiana Tambouratzis;Myrsini Gazela	2002	International journal of neural systems	10.1142/S0129065702001205	simulation;weather forecasting;computer science;machine learning;data mining;artificial neural network	ML	89.89950555831338	-56.48843096204574	161283

The performances of these TES methods are analyzed and compared under different instrument characteristics, including spectral shifting and full-width half-maximum (FWHM) broadening and instrument noise with the simulated data. The results show the spectral smoothness methods all have similar sensitivities to instrument characteristics, but the definition of smoothness indices is an important factor that affects the retrieval accuracy. LSEC has the most robust and accurate performance, even with a spectral shifting of 0.1 cm−1, FWHM broadening of 20% and instrument noise of 0.2K, the RMSE of retrieved temperature is still within 0.15K.	iterative method;performance;spectral method;stellar classification	Ning Wang;Yonggang Qian;Lingling Ma;Lingli Tang;Chuanrong Li	2016	2016 8th Workshop on Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing: Evolution in Remote Sensing (WHISPERS)	10.1109/WHISPERS.2016.8071775	full width at half maximum;infrared;residual;smoothness;thermal;radiance;hyperspectral imaging;optics;emissivity;physics	Vision	84.92652659318343	-62.90967696824256	161359

At first, the accuracies of the forward reflection models were examined using the moment method (MM). The physical optics (PO) approximation has commonly used to compute the forward reflection coefficient of a randomly rough surface, in which an exponential function of a surface roughness parameter and incidence angle is multiplied to Fresnel reflection coefficient. Another model was proposed by Miller and Brown (MB Model), in which an additional term of modified Bessel function is multiplied to the PO model. The accuracies of those two models were examined based on the moment method solution for various value of khrms where k is wavenumber and hrms is the surface RMS(root-mean-square) height. We found that MB model is more accurate for large khrms values. Those models do not include the effect of surface correlation length, where the MM solution shows the effect clearly. Therefore, we examined the effect of correlation length on the reflection coefficients of randomly rough lossy dielectric surfaces using the MM technique.	approximation;bessel filter;horner's method;incidence matrix;lossy compression;microwave;randomness;reflection coefficient;time complexity	Sinmyong Park;Yisok Oh	2015	2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7325862	surface roughness;reflection coefficient;mathematics;geometry;optics;computational model;correlation;physics	Vision	84.62351651656806	-66.7652585241926	161478

In this context, the detection of spatio-temporal changes in ET remains poorly investigated for specific Andean ecosystems, like the páramo. To overcome this lack of knowledge, we implemented the energy-balance model METRIC with Landsat 7 ETM+ and MODIS-Terra imagery for a páramo catchment. The implementation contemplated adjustments for complex terrain in order to obtain daily, monthly and annual ET maps (between 2013 and 2014). In addition, we compared our results to the global ET product MOD16. Finally, a rigorous validation of the outputs was conducted with residual ET from the water balance. ET retrievals from METRIC (Landsat-based) showed good agreement with the validation-related ET at monthly and annual steps (mean bias error <8 mm ̈month ́1 and annual deviation <17%). However, METRIC (MODIS-based) outputs and the MOD16 product were revealed to be unsuitable for our study due to the low spatial resolution. At last, the plausibility of METRIC to obtain spatial ET retrievals using higher resolution satellite data is demonstrated, which constitutes the first contribution to the understanding of spatially-explicit ET over an alpine catchment in the neo-tropical Andes.	alpine;detailed balance;ecosystem services;electron tomography;metric;map;plausibility structure	Galo Carrillo-Rojas;Brenner Silva;Mario Córdova;Rolando Célleri;Jörg Bendix	2016	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs8020160	evapotranspiration;metric;hydrology;remote sensing	Robotics	85.29403831973049	-57.98583164325717	161551

The ESA's SMOS mission is the first satellite providing frequent SSM and ocean salinity observations at global scale. In this paper, a sensitivity study about the relationship of the LST and SSM is performed using in-situ measurements from the REMEDHUS network and spaceborne observations from MODIS and SMOS. Results show that the correlation between SSM and LST (both in-situ and remotely sensed) is highest using the daily maximum LST. This could help improving SSM algorithms and deriving new SSM products at higher resolution from the synergy of microwave and TIR observations.	algorithm;aqua;esa;l band;microwave;sensor;synergy	Miriam Pablos;Maria Piles;Nilda Sanchez-Martin;Verónica González-Gambau;Mercè Vall-Llossera;Adriano Camps;José Martínez-Fernández	2014	2014 IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2014.6947176	meteorology;hydrology;remote sensing	Mobile	83.66876185074663	-61.4324847911115	161760
6b262bf1094b7a2ab2621217127994294a41d36e	an extended kriging method to interpolate near-surface soil moisture data measured by wireless sensor networks	kriging interpolation;soil moisture;spectral variables;wireless sensor network	In the practice of interpolating near-surface soil moisture measured by a wireless sensor network (WSN) grid, traditional Kriging methods with auxiliary variables, such as Co-kriging and Kriging with external drift (KED), cannot achieve satisfactory results because of the heterogeneity of soil moisture and its low correlation with the auxiliary variables. This study developed an Extended Kriging method to interpolate with the aid of remote sensing images. The underlying idea is to extend the traditional Kriging by introducing spectral variables, and operating on spatial and spectral combined space. The algorithm has been applied to WSN-measured soil moisture data in HiWATER campaign to generate daily maps from 10 June to 15 July 2012. For comparison, three traditional Kriging methods are applied: Ordinary Kriging (OK), which used WSN data only, Co-kriging and KED, both of which integrated remote sensing data as covariate. Visual inspections indicate that the result from Extended Kriging shows more spatial details than that of OK, Co-kriging, and KED. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of Extended Kriging was found to be the smallest among the four interpolation results. This indicates that the proposed method has advantages in combining remote sensing information and ground measurements in soil moisture interpolation.	algorithm;extended ascii;interpolation imputation technique;kriging;mean squared error;neural network simulation;plant roots;spectral method	Jialin Zhang;Xiuhong Li;Rongjin Yang;Qiang Liu;Long Zhao;Baocheng Dou	2017		10.3390/s17061390	wireless sensor network;engineering;electronic engineering;grid;interpolation;statistics;remote sensing;water content;kriging;variogram;mean squared error	Robotics	85.85785752994443	-60.495947759634056	162196
a602f01b5837d04df48a83cbc2152d7266566d33	a model for downscaling smos soil moisture using sentinel-1 sar data		Abstract A model for downscaling SMOS (Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity) soil moisture products is developed by using multi-temporal dual-polarized (HH+HV) C-band SAR data. In this model, the effect of vegetation on soil moisture retrieval from SAR data is minimized by using the water-cloud model (WCM), in which vegetation contribution is quantified using the backscatter coefficient of HV polarization. The wavelet transform is used to fuse high resolution Sentinel-1A SAR backscatter with low resolution SMOS soil moisture, where the difference in spatial heterogeneity between scales is also accounted for. The influence of soil surface roughness is eliminated by using multi-temporal data. The multi-temporal SMOS soil moisture and dual-pol Sentinel-1/SAR data are the only inputs of this downscaling model. The model is tested in southern Ontario, Canada to downscale 40 km resolution SMOS soil moisture to 1.25 km and 2.5 km resolutions. The downscaled results show good agreements with the in-situ soil moisture collected in May and July of 2016 with an unbiased root-mean-square-error ( RMSE ) of 0.045 m 3 /m 3 and 0.047 m 3 /m 3 and a coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) of 0.54 and 0.70 at 1.25 km and 2.5 km resolutions respectively. The results suggest that the model can be applied for C-band at regional scales to provide continuous soil moisture mapping at higher resolutions. The high revisit frequency of the up-coming Radarsat Constellation Mission (RCM) combined with its large areal coverage characteristics are ideal for the generation of downscaled products.	downscaling	Junhua Li;Shusen Wang;Grant E.

It aims to better interpret synthetic aperture radar backscattering relationships to soil moisture. Coincident with RADARSAT-2 overpasses, soil and crop parameters were measured in July 2008 and August 2009 over two Canadian agricultural sites (Kenaston, Saskatchewan, and Lennoxville, Québec). The measured soil moisture was used to determine the theoretical semivariogram models that fit the experimental semivariograms. An inverse correlation is obtained between the soil moisture coefficient of variation (CV) and the range (spatial correlation) of the semivariogram, which can assess the degree of the spatial correlation between the samples of each field. Soil moisture measurements with high values of CV (20%–40%) are correlated within a distance less than 10 m and those with lower CV (10%–20%) are correlated within a larger distance varying between 12 and 46 m. The soil moisture measurements of each field were upscaled to the spatial resolution of RADARSAT-2 images ( <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$\text{6}\times \text{5}$</tex-math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">${\text{9}}\times {\text{5 m}}^{2}$</tex-math></inline-formula>) using either <italic>simple kriging</italic> or <italic>ordinary kriging</italic>.

Landsat TM and OLI scenes, as well as the method of Markov Chains (MC) were used. Grasslands and Shrublands were the land uses that experienced the highest pressures for land use. Grasslands occupied 23.5% of the area in 1989, decreasing to 16.01% in 2014. Likewise, Shrublands were reduced from 54.53% to 48.06%. The areas occupied by Croplands, Oak forest, Water bodies and Riparian vegetation stayed in general constant. In contrast, the urban area increased from 13.6% to 28.6% of the total area studied. In addition, projections of land use for 2019 and 2024 were generated through the method of MC and Cellular Automata (CA). According to the projections, validated with an agreement of 0.90, the Human settlements would continue to expand, occupying 38.57% by 2019 and almost half of the studied territory (47.33%) by 2024. The ecosystems with the highest pressure for land use change will continue to be the Grasslands and Shrublands. By 2024, the former would lose 15.8% while the latter would lose 16.7% of the area. These methods are valuable for urban planning and the results could support growth plans for Chihuahua City, Mexico, with a sustainable approach.	basis function;cellular automaton;ecosystem;markov chain;peripheral;simulation	Jesús A.

This work applies Gaussian process regression to tree height estimation. Estimates are produced in a coniferous boreal forest area in Southern Finland. GP regression produces both estimate and predictive variance for each pixel. Results show that Gaussian process regression produces estimates which are as good as the ones produced by existing methods. The root-mean-square error from GP regression is lower, estimates have less bias and maximum value is closer to the actual maximum. Predictions can be applied and ingested to carbon modelling where estimates are either direct input parameters or they serve for validation the parameters computed by the models.	climate model;gaussian process;kriging;pixel;tree (data structure)	Teemu Mutanen;Laura Sirro;Yrjö Rauste	2016	2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729450	econometrics;hydrology;gaussian process;predictive modelling;computational model;physics;satellite;vegetation;remote sensing	Robotics	86.23429241151304	-61.003093374825895	163490

The accelerometer's drift determines the long-term accuracy of the strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS), which is the primary and most critical component of the strapdown airborne gravimeter. A long-term stability test lasting 104 days was conducted to determine the characteristics of the strapdown airborne gravimeter's long-term drift. This stability test was based on the first set of strapdown airborne gravimeters built in China, the SGA-WZ. The test results reveal a quadratic drift in the strapdown airborne gravimeter data. A drift model was developed using the static data in the two end sections, and then this model was used to correct the test data. After compensating for the drift, the drift effect improved from 70 mGal to 3.46 mGal with a standard deviation of 0.63 mGal. The quadratic curve better reflects the drift's real characteristics. In comparison with other methodologies, modelling the drift as a quadratic curve was shown to be more appropriate. Furthermore, this method allows the drift to be adjusted throughout the course of the entire campaign.	airborne ranger;cns disorder;carbon dioxide:scnc:pt:blda:qn;inertial navigation system;maximal set;quadratic function;standard deviation;synthetic genetic array;test data;winzip;accelerometers;sensor (device)	Shaokun Cai;Kaidong Zhang;Meiping Wu;Yang-Ming Huang	2012		10.3390/s120811091	quadratic function;bioinformatics;remote sensing	ML	87.95450297982238	-58.9785947695851	163501
f36a6f1e993d2c916cae72b5fdf039b561868dab	irrigation pivot-center connected at low cost for the reduction of crop water requirements		Irrigation, particularly pivot-center, is widely used around the world to fill the need of crop watering. This method of irrigation has a low efficiency compared to other methods of irrigation such as drip systems and generally they use water without consider the real need of plants. In this paper we propose an automation system based on the Internet of Things (IoT), Geographic Information System (GIS) and quasi real-time in the cloud of water requirements to improve the efficiency of water use. Indeed, each segment of the pivot-center moves at a different speed compared to others; thus, must be individually controlled to optimize the yield of irrigation. Moreover, it necessary to integrate factors such as stage of crops' development, heterogeneity of soil, runoff, drainage, soil components, nutrients and moisture content. In this paper we develop a complete system integrating sensors, GIS, Internet of Things and cloud computing. This approach allows to automate fine-grained the consumption of water without decreasing the yield. In addition to that, the collect of data and the soil moisture measurement will allow to adapt coefficient of evapotranspiration to local weather without having to resort to lysimetric measures. The proposed architecture allows to store and treat real-time, time series data and low-priority data such as 3D images used in digital phenotyping field which are treated with batch processing.	algorithm;artificial intelligence;batch processing;central processing unit;cloud computing;coefficient;computation;downtime;geographic information system;graphics processing unit;internet of things;interpolation;maximal set;microphone;persistent vegetative state;real-time clock;real-time locating system;requirement;sensor;typset and runoff;tegra;time series	Olivier Debauche;Meryem El Moulat;Saïd Mahmoudi;Pierre Manneback;Frédéric Lebeau	2018	2018 International Conference on Advanced Communication Technologies and Networking (CommNet)	10.1109/COMMNET.2018.8360259	architecture;water resource management;evapotranspiration;water use;irrigation;drainage;water content;surface runoff;precision agriculture;environmental science	Robotics	84.03418549008602	-53.082176678600206	163506

The grid nudging and integration time of the simulations were the tested numerical options. Since the goal is to simulate the near-surface wind, the physical parameterization schemes regarding the boundary layer were the ones under evaluation. Also, the influences of the local terrain complexity and simulation domain resolution on the model results were also studied. Data from three wind measuring stations located within the chosen area were compared with the model results, in terms of Root Mean Square Error, Standard Deviation Error and Bias. Wind speed histograms, occurrences and energy wind roses were also used for model evaluation. Globally, the model accurately reproduced the local wind regime, despite a significant underestimation of the wind speed. The wind direction is reasonably simulated by the model especially in wind regimes where there is a clear dominant sector, but in the presence of low wind speeds the characterization of the wind direction (observed and simulated) is very subjective and led to higher deviations between simulations and observations. Within the tested options, results show that the use of grid nudging in simulations that should not exceed an integration time of 2 days is the best numerical configuration, and the parameterization set composed by the physical schemes MM5eYonsei UniversityeNoah are the most suitable for this site. Results were poorer in sites with higher terrain complexity, mainly due to limitations of the terrain data supplied to the model. The increase of the simulation domain resolution alone is not enough to significantly improve the model performance. Results suggest that error minimization in the wind simulation can be achieved by testing and choosing a suitable numerical and physical configuration for the region of interest together with the use of high resolution terrain data, if available. 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The model predictions were compared against CSTT thresholds for assessing eutrophication in estuaries and coastal waters. For the no barrage scenario, as well as the ebb-only and flood-ebb operating modes, the estuary was found to be potentially eutrophic as the predicted equilibrium nutrient concentrations and potential maximum phytoplankton biomass chlorophyll concentrations exceeded the threshold limits. Potential maximum phytoplankton primary productivity under both ebb-only and flood-ebb operating modes were found to be noticeably higher than that for the no barrage scenario. This is believed to be due to a combination of increased water residence time and greater light availability behind the barrage. However, the conditions for phytoplankton production are likely to be more favourable under ebb-only operating mode as the potential for maximum phytoplankton primary production was found to be significantly increased under ebb-only operating mode, with largely decreased suspended particulate	block cipher mode of operation;one-way function	Margaret Kadiri;Reza Ahmadian;Bettina N.

The experiment took place on the eastern Italian Alps and included micrometeorological and conventional snow measurements as well. The measurements confirmed the high sensitivity of microwave emission at 19 and 37 GHz to the melting-refreezing cycles of snow. Moreover, micrometeorological data made it possible to simulate snow density, temperature, and liquid water content through a hydrological snowpack model and provided additional insight into these processes. Simulations obtained with a two-layer electromagnetic model based on the strong fluctuation theory and driven by the output of the hydrological snowpack model were consistent with experimental data and allowed interpretation of both variation in microwave emission during the melting and refreezing phases and in discerning the contributions of the upper and lower layers of snow as well as of the underlying ground surface.	alpine;computational electromagnetics;computer simulation;microwave;quantum fluctuation;sampling (signal processing);sensor;snow;synergy;whole earth 'lectronic link	Giovanni Macelloni;Simonetta Paloscia;Paolo Pampaloni;Marco Brogioni;Roberto Ranzi;Andrea Crepaz	2005	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2005.855070	meteorology;melting;snow;radiometry;process simulation;water content;temperature;fusion;interpretation;density;microwave;hydrology;microwave radiometer;brightness temperature;liquid water content;theory;physics;remote sensing	Vision	84.13065647796351	-64.79861186660798	164869

Optical remote sensing is an alternative, but it has some limitations in the aquatic environment. The use of echosounder techniques is efficient to detect submerged targets. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate different kinds of interpolation approach applied on SAV sample data collected by echosounder. This study case was performed in a region of Uberaba River - Brazil. The interpolation methods evaluated in this work follow: Nearest Neighbor, Weighted Average, Triangular Irregular Network (TIN) and ordinary kriging. Better results were carried out with kriging interpolation. Thus, it is recommend the use of geostatistics for spatial inference of SAV from sample data surveyed with echosounder techniques.	aquatic ecosystem;challenge–response spam filtering;kriging;nearest-neighbor interpolation;triangulated irregular network	Luiz Henrique da Silva Rotta;Nilton Nobuhiro Imai	2012	2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6351439	underwater acoustics;weighted arithmetic mean;interpolation;hydrology;aquatic ecosystem;geographic information system;kriging;vegetation;statistics;remote sensing	Embedded	85.54218025564376	-60.83840935590521	165030
6d1de4c085d4445e5f1968ebd95c691e8a8db1fd	summer heat risk index: how to integrate recent climatic changes and soil consumption component		7 Face to the urban resiliency two major environmental threats are widely recognized: the increasing summer air temperatures and the soil consumption that affects a large number of city in Italy. The work have the goal to present preliminary the actual Heat Summer Risk defined by using Crichton’s Risk Triangle (Crichton, 1999) on the second Italian level of administration (ADM2 Province). For each administrative unit we have considered as hazard layer the most recent trend of summer air temperature assessed (1980-2014); the exposure layer is individuated by the amount of population living in each province and finally as vulnerable layer the mean degree of soil consumption expressed in percentage was considered. Thanks to these information Crichton’s methodology are able to give a quantitative risk value index further classified in five risk class. Data sources was provided by several authoritative institutions : (i) ISPRA ( Italian National Institute for Environmental Protection and Research) that provide data about density of soil consumption for 2015 as reported in the Soil Consumption Report 2016; (ii) ECAD (European Climate Assessment & Dataset) that gives detailed historical daily climatic layers (E-OBS 1950-2015 v 13.0); (iii) ISTAT ( Italian National Institute of Statistics) that provides the last updates on Italian population data (2016). The results was mapped and presented. All computations was carried out in R-STAT environment by using different library available for Spatial and Trend Analysis.

The basic rationale for retrieving soil moisture from radiometric measurements is the assumption that the surface layer can be modeled as a dielectric medium. Its dielectric constant then depends on several physical parameters, including soil moisture; emissivities for various incidence angles are computed using Fresnel's formulas. Many controlled field experiments have demonstrated the validity of this approach. Scenes exist still (e.g., ice-covered or frozen surfaces, barren areas) where surface soil moisture is not a relevant concept. For such scenes, information should, however, be available on the complex dielectric constant itself. This paper shows that the dielectric constant cannot be fully retrieved from single-frequency multiangular data; it describes, however, a methodology that aims at retrieving in an optimized way the available information.	design rationale;experiment;incidence matrix;l band;metric;microwave;single-frequency network	Philippe Waldteufel;Jean-Luc Vergely;Charles Cot	2004	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2003.821698	meteorology;regularization;field experiment;radiometry;water content;surface layer;microwave;hydrology;frequency;methodology;emissivity;microwave radiometer;optics;data acquisition;physics;quantum mechanics;permittivity;remote sensing;dielectric	Vision	84.02626903729026	-64.38090567737756	165932

Against the background of the current sustainable development debate there is an increasing demand of reliable information about the future trends of these land-use developments. Remote Sensing provides the required data and methods for an operational monitoring of land-use/-cover changes. However for the prediction of future trends additional information and a deep understanding of the driving forces of land-use/-cover change is needed. Here we show an exemplary pathway for obtaining the required future land-use information using accurate and stable techniques. We acquired historical land-use information using Landsat imagery. The measured changes (e.g. an increase of urban areas of about 37% between 1984 and 2005) are driven by a variety of socio-economic causes that have been evaluated statistically. We used this information to calibrate a spatial predictive model that has been implemented in the generic modeling framework XULU (eXtendable Unified LandUse Modeling Platform).	gene regulatory network	Roland Goetzke;Matthias Braun;Hans-Peter Thamm;Gunter Menz	2008	IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779770	land-use planning;logistics;data modeling;urban sprawl;urbanization;land use;land use, land-use change and forestry;systems modeling;hydrology;computational model;sustainable development;satellite;regression analysis;remote sensing	Embedded	85.09592278818342	-56.40817314022957	166017
e896a6caed0907bc331a2a76cdc1e550e4ca48fa	comparison between sar soil moisture estimates and hydrological model simulations over the scrivia test site	inversion algorithms;artificial neural networks;sar data;soil moisture;hydrological model	In this paper, the results of a comparison between the soil moisture content (SMC) estimated from C-band SAR, the SMC simulated by a hydrological model, and the SMC measured on ground are presented. The study was carried out in an agricultural test site located in North-west Italy, in the Scrivia river basin. The hydrological model used for the simulations consists of a one-layer soil water balance model, which was found to be able to partially reproduce the soil moisture variability, retaining at the same time simplicity and effectiveness in describing the topsoil. SMC estimates were derived from the application of a retrieval algorithm, based on an Artificial Neural Network approach, to a time series of ENVISAT/ASAR images acquired over the Scrivia test site. The core of the algorithm was represented by a set of ANNs able to deal with the different SAR configurations in terms of polarizations and available ancillary data. In case of crop covered soils, the effect of vegetation was accounted for using NDVI information, or, if available, for the cross-polarized channel. The algorithm results showed some ability in retrieving SMC with RMSE generally <0.04 m/m and very low bias (i.e., <0.01 m/m), except for the case of VV polarized SAR images: in this case, the obtained RMSE was somewhat higher than 0.04 m/m (≤0.058 m/m). The algorithm was implemented within the framework of an ESA project concerning the development of an operative algorithm OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2013, 5 4962 for the SMC retrieval from Sentinel-1 data. The algorithm should take into account the GMES requirements of SMC accuracy (≤5% in volume), spatial resolution (≤1 km) and timeliness (3 h from observation). The SMC estimated by the SAR algorithm, the SMC estimated by the hydrological model, and the SMC measured on ground were found to be in good agreement. The hydrological model simulations were performed at two soil depths: 30 and 5 cm and showed that the 30 cm simulations indicated, as expected, SMC values higher than the satellites estimates, with RMSE higher than 0.08 m/m. In contrast, in the 5-cm simulations, the agreement between hydrological simulations, satellite estimates and ground measurements could be considered satisfactory, at least in this preliminary comparison, showing a RMSE ranging from 0.054 m/m to 0.051 m/m for comparison with ground measurements and SAR estimates, respectively.	algorithm;artificial neural network;computer simulation;detailed balance;esa;heart rate variability;requirement;time series;verification and validation	Emanuele Santi;Simonetta Paloscia;Simone Pettinato;Claudia Notarnicola;Luca Pasolli;Alberto Pistocchi	2013	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs5104961	meteorology;water content;hydrology;machine learning;artificial neural network;remote sensing	ML	84.16505380252788	-60.136334624684686	166323

An alternative approach is to use pedotransfer functions which predict various soil hydraulic properties based on more readily available physical properties. Pedotransfer functions have been developed that operate with various levels of information. Greater available information yields more reliable estimates of any particular hydraulic property. Because some of the physical properties being used in pedotransfer functions are not available on a regional scale, there is a need to develop pedotransfer functions for use with regional soil databases. A system is described that uses soil texture classes and remotely sensed soil moisture in the dry state to estimate soil hydraulic properties at a 800 m pixel scale.	database;pixel	Walter J.

A non-spatial model, using Ordinary Least Squares(OLS) approach, was firstly built to measure the effects of climatic change on grain production, and then a spatial econometric model including the spatially weighted values of the explained and the explanatory variables to obtain more consistent and efficient estimates was developed by using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation approach. We find that spatial lag and spatial error models built on the rationale of spatial econometrics might be serving as an alternative to capture the effects from the dependent variables as well as the independent variables when we explore the impacts of climate change on the grain production in China.

dc2e0b0995d3b9f99eddc26caa6fd23962c0eaf1	characterizing fragmentation trends of the himalayan forests in the kumaon region of uttarakhand, india		Forest fragmentation is a major conservation issue, which includes interdependent components of forest loss and changes in their spatial patterns. Over the years, the Himalayan forests have experienced major changes, but data and documentation on patterns and causes of forest fragmentation are limited. In this study, we analyzed temporal changes (1990–2014) of forest loss and fragmentation using Landsat imageries in the Kumaon division of Uttarakhand state, India. To assess mechanisms causing forest fragmentation, we investigated changes in following quantitative parameters describing forest fragmentation: (i) forest area density (Pf), (ii) overall forest connectivity (Pff), (iii) anthropogenic fragmentation (Pfa), and (iv) natural fragmentation (Pfn). We found that this region is undergoing intensive forest fragmentation, shifting from forest-dominated landscapes to fragmented forests intermixed with agricultural lands and urban settlements. Overall, intact forest patches decreased between 1990 and 2009 (1442 km2), followed by a small gain from 2009 to 2014 (260 km2). In lower altitudes, anthropogenic activities caused fragmentation; while in higher altitudes, fragmentation can be attributed to natural causes. All districts within the region show a decreasing trend of forest cover area, with the highest rate of forest cover loss for the low-lying district of Udham Singh Nagar and the lowest rate for the high-lying district of Bageshwar. This trend can be associated with increasing population density in low-lying districts than high-lying districts. Our results emphasize on delineating spatial trends of forest loss and fragmentation to support the identification of conservation sites. The findings can further help in developing forest policies for maintaining local livelihood options in the Himalayan region.	fragmentation (computing)	Anusheema Chakraborty;Aniruddha Ghosh;Kamna Sachdeva;Pawan K.

dbf9598038f0773f01ab987abcbb15cbb10fd51a	albis: integrated system for risk-based surveillance of invasive mosquito aedes albopictus		The continuous expansion of invasive Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, combined to its ability to transmit arboviruses (e.g. dengue, chikungunya) is raising major public health concern in Europe. Furthermore, there is a real risk that this mosquito will colonize also urban areas North of the Alps in the next years. In fact, the spatial distribution and colonization of new areas by invasive mosquito species Ae. albopictus depends on several environmental parameters, such as winter and summer temperatures, and precipitation patterns. A key factor for Ae. albopictus to establish at higher latitudes is the capability to develop cold-tolerant overwintering diapausing eggs under specific environmental conditions. Weather-driven abundance models are used to map the areas of potential distribution and to predict temporal dynamics of Ae. albopictus and the transmission potential of arboviruses.	tiger team	Milan Petar Antonovic;Massimiliano Cannata;Andrea Danani;Lukas Engeler;Eleonora Flacio;Francesca Mangili;Damiana Ravasi;Daniele Strigaro;Mauro Tonolla	2018	PeerJ PrePrints	10.7287/peerj.preprints.27251v1	ecology;aedes albopictus;tiger mosquito;internet of things;biology	ML	84.33576262192638	-55.42182764057331	167606

Data assimilation can be viewed as a process to optimally merge the model estimate and the observed information based upon some estimate of their error characteristics. This paper presents a case study of assimilating the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite soil moisture retrievals (2010-2013) into a coupled land-surface and hydrological model MESH with an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). The assimilation experiment is conducted over the Great Lakes basin. The assimilation is validated against in situ soil moisture measurements (53 sites) from the Michigan Automated Weather Network, the Soil Climate Analysis Network, and the Fluxnet-Canada, in terms of the daily-spaced anomaly time series correlation coefficient (soil moisture skill). Results indicate that the assimilation of SMOS retrievals enhances the MESH model's soil moisture skill.	anomaly detection;coefficient;data assimilation;ensemble kalman filter;observed information;time series	Xiaoyong Xu;Jonathan Li;Bryan A.

c7b6fa4833cd970d3850b34352950850bd7241a8	soil moisture monitoring in a temperate peatland using multi-sensor remote sensing and linear mixed effects		The purpose of this research was to use empirical models to monitor temporal dynamics of soil moisture in a peatland using remotely sensed imagery, and to determine the predictive accuracy of the approach on dates outside the time series through statistically independent validation. A time series of seven Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images were collected along with concurrent field measurements of soil moisture over one growing season, and soil moisture retrieval was tested using Linear Mixed Effects models (LMEs). A single-date airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) survey was incorporated into the analysis, along with temporally varying environmental covariates (Drought Code, Time Since Last Rain, Day of Year). LMEs allowed repeated measures to be accounted for at individual sampling sites, as well as soil moisture differences associated with peatland classes. Covariates provided a large amount of explanatory power in models; however, SAR imagery contributed to only a moderate improvement in soil moisture predictions (marginal R2 = 0.07; conditional R2 = 0.7, independently validated R2 = 0.36). The use of LMEs allows for a more accurate characterization of soil moisture as a function of specific measurement sites, peatland classes and measurement dates on model strength and predictive power. For intensively monitored peatlands, SAR data is best analyzed in conjunction with peatland Class (e.g., derived from an ecosystem classification map) to estimate the spatial distribution of surface soil moisture, provided there is a ground-based monitoring network with a sufficiently fine spatial and temporal resolution to fit the LME models.

fb495c2fbf00ad688a17e17b66199f5357d070ea	extension of the generalized split-window algorithm for land surface temperature retrieval to atmospheres with air temperature inversion		This paper aims to extend the generalized split-window (GSW) algorithm in land surface temperature (LST) retrieval to atmospheres with air temperature inversion (ATI) near the Earth surface boundary. Simulation analysis shows that the influence of ATI on the LST retrieval of the GSW algorithm becomes larger when the ATI intensity increases. To further analyze the influence, all ATI atmospheric profiles are extracted from the Thermodynamic Initial Guess Retrieval (TIGR) cloud-free database. Combining the ATI atmospheric profiles and the GSW coefficients, we find that the LST retrieval error caused by ATI is larger than 0.3 K. To reduce the LST retrieval error associated with the ATI in the GSW algorithm, a quadratic equation as a function of ATI intensity is proposed. To validate the proposed method, some in situ measurements observed at the Hailar site are used. The results show that the proposed method could improve the LST retrieval accuracy by 0.47 K for atmospheres under ATI conditions.	algorithm;coefficient;quadratic equation;simulation	Chuan Zhan;Bo-Hui Tang;Zhao-Liang Li;Hua Wu;Ruofei Zhong	2017	2017 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8128086	computer science;algorithm;atmosphere;inversion (meteorology)	Vision	84.82241771407219	-61.43143691738244	167967
1998eca57539ed9ad8da3e2b316a12afc6e0143b	mapping presence and predicting phenological status of invasive buffelgrass in southern arizona using modis, climate and citizen science observation data	modis ndvi;prism;phenology;invasive species;correlation phenometrics;buffelgrass	The increasing spread and abundance of an invasive perennial grass, buffelgrass (Pennisetum ciliare), represents a critical threat to the native vegetation communities of the Sonoran desert in southern Arizona, USA, where buffelgrass eradication is a high priority for resource managers. Herbicidal treatment of buffelgrass is most effective when the vegetation is actively growing, but the remoteness of infestations and the erratic timing and length of the species’ growth periods confound effective treatment. The goal of our research is to promote buffelgrass management by using remote sensing data to detect where the invasive plants are located and when they are photosynthetically active. We integrated citizen scientist observations of buffelgrass phenology in the Tucson, Arizona area with PRISM precipitation data, eight-day composites of 250-m Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery, and aerially-mapped polygons of buffelgrass presence to understand dynamics and relationships between precipitation and the timing and amount of buffelgrass greenness from 2011 to 2013. Our results show that buffelgrass responds quickly to antecedent rainfall: in pixels containing buffelgrass, higher correlations (R2 > 0.5) typically occur after two cumulative eight-day periods of rain, whereas in pixels dominated by native vegetation, four prior 8-day periods are required to reach that threshold. Using the new suite of phenometrics introduced here—Climate Landscape Response metrics—we accurately predicted the location of 49% to 55% of buffelgrass patches in Saguaro National Park. These metrics and the suggested guidelines for their use can be employed by resource managers to treat buffelgrass during optimal time periods.	citizen science;prism (surveillance program);pixel	Cynthia S.

Both three-day and one-day maps are studied. The noise level on these maps, evaluated from the difference between successive maps, varies from 2 to 7%, increasing as backscatter level or number of measurements decrease. Spectral analysis indicates the resolution of these maps to be around 40 km, that of the 25-km pixel maps around 60 km.

The measurements are affected by strong radiometric noise. However, during a satellite overpass, numerous measurements are acquired at various incidence angles at the same location on the Earth's surface. The sea surface salinity (SSS) retrieval algorithm implemented in the Level 2 Salinity Prototype Processor (L2SPP) is based on an iterative inversion method that minimizes the differences between Tb measured at different incidence angles and Tb simulated by a full forward model. The iterative method is initialized with a first-guess surface salinity that is iteratively modified until an optimal fit between the forward model and the measurements is obtained. The forward model takes into account atmospheric emission and absorption, ionospheric effects (Faraday rotation), scattering of celestial radiation by the rough ocean surface, and rough sea surface emission as approximated by one of three models. Potential degradation of the retrieval results is indicated through a flagging strategy. We present results of tests of the L2SPP involving horizontally uniform scenes with no disturbing factors (such as sun glint or land proximity) other than wind-induced surface roughness. Regardless of the roughness model used, the error on the retrieved SSS depends on the location within the swath and ranges from 0.5 psu at the center of the swath to 1.7 psu at the edge, at 35 psu and 15degC. Dual-polarization (DP) mode provides a better correction for wind-speed (WS) biases than pseudofirst Stokes mode (ST1). For a WS bias of -1 mmiddots-1, the corresponding SSS bias at the center of the swath is equal to -0.3 psu in DP mode and to -0.5 psu in ST1 mode. The inversion methodology implicitly assumes that WS errors follow a Gaussian distribution, even though these errors should follow more closely a Rayleigh distribution. For this reason, the use of wind components, which typically exhibit Gaussian error distributions, may be preferred in the retrieval. However, the use of noisy wind components creates WS and SSS biases at low WSs (0.1 psu at 3 mmiddots-1). At a sea surface temperature (SST) of 15degC, the retrieved SSS is weakly sensitive to the SST biases, with the SSS bias always lower than 0.3 psu for SST biases ranging from -0.5degC to -2degC. In DP mode, biases in the vertical total electron content (TEC) of the atmosphere result in SSS biases smaller than 0.2 psu. The pseudofirst Stokes mode is insensitive to TEC. Failure to fully account for sea surface roughness scattering effects in the computation of sky radiation contribution leads to a maximum SSS bias of 0.2 psu in the selected configuration, i.e., a descending orbit over the Northern Pacific in February. To achieve SSS biases that are smaller than 0.2 psu, special care must be taken to correct for biases at low WS and to ensure that the bias on the mean WS (averaged over 200 km times 200 km and ten days) remains smaller than 0.5 mmiddots-1.	action potential;advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer;approximation algorithm;celestial coordinate system;computation;elegant degradation;faraday cage;faraday effect;incidence matrix;inverse transform sampling;iterative method;l band;navier–stokes equations;power supply unit (computer);prototype;rayleigh–ritz method;seagate st1;total electron content	Sonia Zine;Jacqueline Boutin;Jordi Font;Nicolas Reul;Philippe Waldteufel;Carolina Gabarro;Joseph Tenerelli;François Petitcolin;Jean-Luc Vergely;Marco Talone;Steven Delwart	2008	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2008.915543	meteorology;polarization;hydrology;iterative method;optics;physics;quantum mechanics;remote sensing;wind	Vision	83.7191790408487	-64.44440493215095	168230

76faf6cbdd3a36ae27ab004c55ba6a7aee5b7053	light competition in chinese cabbage/maize strip intercropping systems		Due to drastic socio-economic changes traditional intercropping systems in China are endangered. New high yielding intercropping systems that can easily be mechanized have to be developed. By using environmental resources more efficiently intercropping often produces higher yields compared to monocropping. Solar radiation as the strongest growth factor plays a key role when designing new intercropping systems. A Chinese cabbage – maize strip intercropping experiment was run at Hohenheim University’s research station “Ihinger Hof” in 2009. Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was measured regularly in the strips in different distances to the neighboring maize plants. However continuous and simultaneous measurements and thus the direct quantification of differences in daily available PAR were not possible. By adjusting polynomials to the measured timelines and defining sunrise and sunset as the interval borders the integrals of each polynomial could be calculated. Daily PAR was significantly reduced in the first three rows of Chinese cabbage grown next to maize; with the lowest values of 70% and 56% in row one west and east respectively. Reduced PAR led to significant yield decreases in these Chinese cabbage rows. To optimize the spacing in a maize/Chinese cabbage intercropping system PAR availability and tolerance of shading of the subordinate crop will be decisive.	chinese room;higher-order function;polynomial;strips;shading;timeline	Til Feike;Sebastian Munz;Simone Graeff-Hönninger;Judit Pfenning;Gudrun Zühlke;Wilhelm Claupein	2010			intercropping;economics;radiation;agronomy;agroforestry;monocropping	NLP	84.54486923644221	-57.17742701396588	168515

A quick assessment of the status of the vital coastal ecosystems has been made using preand post-tsunami Advance Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) data of Indian satellite RESOURCESAT with an accuracy of 87–90% and the Kappa ranging from 0.8696 to 0.9053. Among the coastal ecosystems the coral reefs have suffered the maximum with the Nicobar reefs (69% eroded and 29% degraded) bearing the brunt more than the Andaman reefs (54% eroded and 22% degraded). Significant improvement to the condition of the reef damaged due to backwash has been noted. About 41% of the Sentinel reef area has undergone significant improvement. The continuance of the erosion of the southwestern Andaman reefs is due to the impact of recurring earthquakes. The impact on mangroves of both the groups of islands has been due to uprooting as well as inundation of seawater and resulting stagnation. Changes are expected in community structure of mangroves as a result of tsunami. 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	ecosystem;the sentinel	Anjali Bahuguna;Shailesh Nayak;Dam Roy	2008	Int. J.

cf07df438a9f3f5983cd2e3cf4aab7b63f9f3b59	on-site ion monitoring system for precision hydroponic nutrient management		Abstract Hydroponic solutions used in greenhouses or plant factories are usually evaluated based on their electrical conductivity (EC) and pH. However, EC and pH cannot provide sufficient information about ion imbalances in hydroponic solutions, and this may result in wastage of nutrients or poor yields. This paper reports on the development of an on-site ion monitoring system based on ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) that can automatically calibrate sensors and measure the concentrations of individual ions (NO 3 − , K + , and Ca 2+ ) in hydroponic solutions. This enables farmers to effectively manage nutrients in reused solutions by rapidly identifying any imbalances that appear in the nutrient ratios. The measurement performance of the developed system was evaluated using hydroponic solutions prepared for growing paprika crops in greenhouses. An application test was conducted to investigate the feasibility of using the developed on-site ion monitoring system for the automated measurement of three macronutrients (NO 3 − , K + , and Ca 2+ ) in a real greenhouse. The results showed that the developed system was able to measure NO 3 − concentrations, showing an almost 1:1 relationship with the results of a standard instrument, i.e., ion chromatography (slope of 0.99 and R 2 of 0.99). Although the developed system overestimated and underestimated the K + and Ca 2+ concentrations with slopes of 1.17 and 0.75, respectively, the high coefficients of determination of 0.99 and 0.97 made it possible to use calibration factors to compensate for differences in estimation. In fact, relatively low RMSEs of −1 over the range of 40–1200 mg L −1 were obtained from a comparison of the ISE method and standard analysis when tested in hydroponic samples taken on different days during the period of paprika growing. This indicates that ISEs could be applicable to measurements where there is a strong linear relationship between the ISE method and standard analysis. In the application tests, the system could monitor the temporal changes in ionic concentrations in hydroponic solutions effectively, showing sensitive responses to changes in the concentrations of the three ions with an acceptable level of performance.

We introduce a simple terrestrial carbon flux (TCF) model driven by satellite remote sensing inputs from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) to estimate surface (<10-cm depth) SOC stocks, daily respiration, and net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE). Soil temperature and moisture information from AMSR-E provide environmental constraints to soil heterotrophic respiration (R h), while gross primary production (GPP) information from MODIS provides estimates of the total photosynthesis and autotrophic respiration. The model results were evaluated across a North American network of boreal forest, grassland, and tundra monitoring sites using alternative carbon measures derived from tower CO2 flux measurements and BIOME-BGC model simulations. Root-mean-square-error (rmse) differences between TCF model estimates and tower observations were 1.2, 0.7, and 1.2 g middot C middot m-2 middot day-1 for GPP, ecosystem respiration (Rtot) and NEE, while mean residual differences were 43% of the rmse. Similar accuracies were observed for both TCF and BIOME-BGC model simulations relative to tower results. TCF-model-derived SOC was in general agreement with soil inventory data and indicates that the dominant SOC source for Rh has a mean residence time of less than five years, while R h is approximately 43% and 55% of R tot for respective summer and annual fluxes. An error sensitivity analysis determined that meaningful flux estimates could be derived under prevailing climatic conditions at the study locations, given documented error levels in the remote sensing inputs.	aquatic ecosystem;carbon cycle;eos;graph partition;microwave;simulation;terrestrial television;tor carding forum	John S.

Whereas it is well known that the surface roughness parameters of a natural soil surface are underestimated with a short surface profile, it is not clear how much the underestimated surface parameters affect the backscattering coefficients of the surface for various incidence angles and polarizations. In this paper, the backscattering coefficients of simulated and measured surface profiles are computed using the integral equation method and analyzed to answer this question. A 4000lmacr-long rough surface is generated numerically, where lmacr is the true correlation length of the surface, and the backscattering coefficients of the surface are computed and analyzed for various conditions. The rms error of the backscattering coefficient at a medium range of incidence angles is less than 1.5 dB for vv-polarization and 0.5 dB for hh-polarization if the profile length is larger than 5lmacr for a surface with ks=1.0, kl=10.0, and epsiv r=(10.0,2.0). Similar results are obtained from numerous simulations with various roughness conditions and various wavelengths. It is also shown that the rms error of the backscattering coefficients between 5- and 1-m-long measured surface profiles is 1.7 dB for vv-polarization and 0.5 dB for hh-polarization at a medium range of incidence angle (15deglesthetasles70deg), whereas the surface roughness parameters are significantly reduced from 2.4 to 1.5 cm for the rms height s and from 35.1 to 10.0 cm for the autocorrelation length l	autocorrelation;coefficient;decibel;incidence matrix;mean squared error;numerical analysis;polarization (waves);rough set;simulation	Yisok Oh;Jin-Young Hong	2007	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2006.888137	computer simulation;surface roughness;polarization;hydrology;optics;backscatter;physics	Vision	84.25740942272311	-66.35072668517243	169397

Generally speaking, estimation of the aerosol optical depth will be affected by the temporal change of surface canopy, observation geometry and terrain effect when applying the contrast reduction method to the multi-temporal satellite image set. In order to reduce the errors induced by such effects, the single-directional structure function is replaced by the multi-directional mode, which can describe the real characteristics of the surface structure more completely. Comparison of the results with in-site observations show a significant improvement in the accuracy of the retrieved AOD. Furthermore, due to the linear relationship between aerosol optical depth and turbidity coefficient, satellite images can be employed for monitoring air quality. Application of the method is demonstrated with a case study situated around the northern Taiwan area.  2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, the CMP method results in noticeable errors in thickness and permittivity readings with the increase of antenna separation. To improve the measurement accuracy, a new mathematical model is presented, covering GPR measurement in one- and two-layer cases. In this model, we first check all the possible wave paths when the GPR signal propagates in the multilayer environment. We not only consider the effects from the air-ground interface but also introduce a ray-path-searching process in the GPR measurement using Fermat's shortest path law. The shortest path is then used in the process of GPR data inversion in order to calculate the depth and permittivity of each layer. Finally, we use the transmission-line matrix (TLM) method to simulate the propagation of a GPR signal in the multilayered formation. A time-sequence image that was produced by the finite-difference time-domain method has also been used to explain this presented model. By comparing the numerical simulation results with the measured results, it is found that the estimated layer thickness and permittivity by the new model agree well with the simulated results. It proves that the new model is more accurate and closer to the real measured situation.	computer simulation;fermat;finite-difference time-domain method;kriging;mathematical model;shortest path problem;software propagation;thickness (graph theory);transmission line	Chien-Ping Kao;Jing Li;Ying Wang;Huichun Xing;Ce Richard Liu	2007	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2007.900980	computer simulation;telecommunications;interface;mathematical model;accuracy and precision;optics;physics;statistics	Visualization	84.24028010245303	-68.34724244784734	170016
fff3688187b5c5b3a0be1ed9df708fe6bffca959	an operational workflow to assess rice nutritional status based on satellite imagery and smartphone apps		Abstract Nitrogen fertilization plays a key role in rice productivity and environmental impact of rice-based cropping systems, as well as on farmers’ income, representing one of the main cost items of rice farming. Average nitrogen use efficiency in rice paddies is often very low (about 30%), leading to groundwater contamination, greenhouse gases emission, and economic losses for farmers. The resulting pressure on many actors in the rice production chain has generated a need for operational tools and techniques able to increase nitrogen use efficiency. We present an operational workflow for producing nitrogen nutritional index (NNI) maps at sub-field scale based on the combined use of high-resolution satellite images and ground-based estimates of Leaf Area Index (LAI) and plant nitrogen concentration (PNC, %) data collected using smart apps. The workflow was tested in northern Italy.

a8ad4e2cb01bc8b4f94518b09b1dd65282be02d3	implementation of algorithm for satellite-derived bathymetry using open source gis and evaluation for tsunami simulation	satellite derived bathymetry;python;grass gis;i image bathymetry;remote sensing;near shore;gwr	Accurate and high resolution bathymetric data is a necessity for a wide range of coastal oceanographic research topics. Active sensing methods, such as ship-based soundings and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), are expensive and time consuming solutions. Therefore, the significance of Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) has increased in the last ten years due to the availability of multi-constellation, multi-temporal, and multi-resolution remote sensing data as Open Data. Effective SDB algorithms have been proposed by many authors, but there is no ready-to-use software module available in the Geographical Information System (GIS) environment as yet. Hence, this study implements a Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) based SDB workflow as a Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (GRASS) GIS module (i.image.bathymetry). Several case studies were carried out to examine the performance of the module in multi-constellation and multi-resolution satellite imageries for different study areas. The results indicate a strong correlation between SDB and reference depth. For instance, case study 1 (Puerto Rico, Northeastern Caribbean Sea) has shown an coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.98 and an Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.61 m, case study 2 (Iwate, Japan) has shown an R2 of 0.94 and an RMSE of 1.50 m, and case study 3 (Miyagi, Japan) has shown an R2 of 0.93 and an RMSE of 1.65 m. The reference depths were acquired by using LiDAR for case study 1 and an echo-sounder for case studies 2 and 3. Further, the estimated SDB has been used as one of the inputs for the Australian National University and Geoscience Australia (ANUGA) tsunami simulation model. The tsunami simulation results also show close agreement with post-tsunami survey data. The i.mage.bathymetry module developed as a part of this study is made available as an extension for the Open Source GRASS GIS to facilitate wide use and future improvements.	advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer;algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;bathymetry;coefficient of determination;computation;estimation theory;geographic information system;geospatial analysis;guinness world records;human height;image resolution;multispectral image;parallel computing;random-access memory;rico;sdb (debugger);simulation;spatial analysis;the australian;web processing service;web service;weight function	Vinayaraj Poliyapram;Venkatesh Raghavan;Markus Metz;Luca Delucchi;Shinji Masumoto	2017	ISPRS Int.

The observations of a very limited number of 9 International GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) Monitoring and Assessment Service (iGMAS) stations and 52 Multi-GNSS Experiment (MGEX) stations from 16 July to 14 August 2016 are processed to determine the orbits of BeiDou-3 and BeiDou-2 satellites, respectively. The internal consistency and satellite laser ranging (SLR) validations are conducted for the orbit validation. BeiDou-3 MEO (Medium Earth Orbit) (C33 and C34) have larger root mean square (RMS) values than does BeiDou-3 IGSO (C31 and C32), whereas BeiDou-2 MEO satellites have smaller RMS values than the BeiDou-2 IGSO satellites. Furthermore, BeiDou-3 IGSO and BeiDou-2 satellites have RMS values at identical levels, whereas BeiDou-3 MEO satellites have larger RMS values than the BeiDou-2 MEO satellites. The RMS residuals are approximately 10 cm in the radial component and approximately 25 cm in the along component for BeiDou-3 IGSO satellites. For BeiDou-3 MEO satellites, the RMS residuals are approximately 40 cm in the radial component and approximately 60 cm in the along component. The SLR validation reports that the orbit radial component can reach an accuracy on the level of 1 decimeter and 4 decimeters for BeiDou-3 IGSO and MEO, respectively.	beidou navigation satellite system;mean squared error;radial (radio);satellite navigation	Bingfeng Tan;Yunbin Yuan;Mingyue Wen;Yafei Ning;Xifeng Liu	2016	ISPRS Int.

This work aims to provide guidance for scientists seeking to adopt this aerial survey method by investigating aerial survey data quality in relation to the application of ground control points (GCPs) at a site of undulating topography (Ennerdale, Lake District, UK). Sixteen digital surface models (DSMs) were produced from a UAV survey using a varying number of GCPs (3-101). These DSMs were compared to 530 dGPS spot heights to calculate vertical error. All DSMs produced reasonable surface reconstructions (vertical root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of <0.2 m), however, an improvement in DSM quality was found where four or more GCPs (up to 101 GCPs) were applied, with errors falling to within the suggested point quality range of the survey equipment used for GCP acquisition (e.g., vertical RMSE of <0.09 m). The influence of a poor GCP distribution was also investigated by producing a DSM using an evenly distributed network of GCPs, and comparing it to a DSM produced using a clustered network of GCPs. The results accord with existing findings, where vertical error was found to increase with distance from the GCP cluster. Specifically vertical error and distance to the nearest GCP followed a strong polynomial trend (R2 = 0.792). These findings contribute to our understanding of the sources of error when conducting a UAV-SfM survey and provide guidance on the collection of GCPs. Evidence-driven UAV-SfM survey designs are essential for practitioners seeking reproducible, high quality topographic datasets for detecting surface change.	aerial photography;aerial survey;data quality;digital geometry;display resolution;games computers play;mean squared error;photogrammetry;polynomial;randomness;requirement;sensor;stereopsis;structure from motion;topography;unmanned aerial vehicle	Toby N.

a7f86f006de680d10d246311130449044a65bc8c	a study on lunar regolith quantitative random model and lunar penetrating radar parameter inversion		Lunar penetrating radar (LPR) is an important way to evaluate the geological structure of the subsurface of the moon. The Chang’E-3 has utilized LPR, which is equipped on the lunar rover named Yutu, to obtain the shallow lunar regolith structure in Mare Imbrium. The previous result provides a unique opportunity to map the subsurface structure and vertical distribution of the lunar regolith with high resolution. In order to evaluate the LPR data, the study of lunar regolith media is of great significance for understanding the material composition of the lunar regolith structure. In this letter, we focus on the lunar regolith quantitative random model and parameter inversion with LPR synthetic data. First, based on the Apollo drilling core data, we build the lunar regolith quantitative random model with clipped Gaussian random field theory. It can be used to model the discrete-valued random field with a given correlation structure. Then, we combine radar wave impedance and stochastic inversion methods to carry out LPR data inversion and parameter estimation. The results mostly provide reliable information on the lunar regolith layer structure and local details with high resolution. This letter presents a further research strategy for lunar probe and deep-space detection with LPR.	apollo computer;characteristic impedance;core data;estimation theory;image resolution;inverse transform sampling;lunar lander challenge;moon;numerical analysis;numerical error;quantum field theory;radar;rover (the prisoner);synthetic data	Jing Li;Zhaofa Zeng;Cai Liu;Nan Huai;Kun Wang	2017	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2017.2743618	remote sensing;random field;ground-penetrating radar;geology;radar;inversion (meteorology);gaussian random field;regolith	Robotics	84.81167894658215	-66.12938340480844	171075

This letter analyzes the dependence of radar backscatter on incidence angle for L-band ScanSAR images of tropical forest. We investigated and modeled the angular backscatter effect per land-cover class in three ScanSAR images of the Colombian Orinoco. We found that there is an evident effect of incidence angle on radar backscatter, depending on land-cover class, moisture content, and physical structure of the reflecting targets. To normalize the angular backscatter variation, we proposed two methods. The first one applies a cosine correction estimated through linear regression. The second one models the radar backscatter of flooded forest considering second-order signal interactions. The model explains the observed backscatter of flooded forest areas in the rainy season (R2 that is larger than 0.77).	angularjs;aperture (software);backscatter (email);incidence matrix;interaction;l band;radar;synthetic data	Juan Pablo Ardila;Valentyn.

8c4733ac63feaa3e668747813155bb9c661b3b49	winter wheat yield assessment using landsat 8 and sentinel-2 data		With availability of images acquired by NASA/USGS Landsat 8 and European Copernicus Sentinel-2 remote sensing satellites, it becomes possible to provide a global coverage of Earth's surface every 3–5 days. Such high temporal resolution is a prerequisite for developing next generation products at moderate spatial resolution (10–30 m). This is especially important for applications, involving agricultural monitoring. This paper explores a combined use of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data to winter wheat yield assessment at regional scale. We take advantage of the NASA's Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) product, which provides a seamless unified product from different sensors aboard both satellites. Multiple features are evaluated through correlation with winter wheat yield values with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) serving as a benchmark. We show that, when using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data together, the error of winter wheat yield estimates can be reduced up to 1.8 times, compared to using a single satellite.	benchmark (computing);http live streaming;seamless3d;sensor	Serhiy Skakun;Belen Franch;Eric F.

6f2acc5b4177250225295e5e9f2f77c2767409a8	three-dimensional inversion of greatem data: application to greatem survey data from kujukuri beach, japan		Studies have shown that the grounded electrical-source airborne transient electromagnetics (GREATEM) method is a promising method for investigating resistivity structures in coastal areas, in addition to those in inaccessible areas such as volcanoes, mountains, and deep forest cover. To expand the application field of the GREATEM system, a three-dimensional (3-D) resistivity model that considers large lateral resistivity variations is required. In this paper, we present a frequency-domain 3-D electromagnetic inversion approach that can be applied to time-domain data from GREATEM. In the frequency-domain approach, TEM data are Fourier-transformed using a smooth-spectrum inversion method, and the recovered frequency response is then inverted. To deal with a large number of grids and a wide range of frequencies in airborne datasets, a method for approximating sensitivities is introduced for efficient 3-D inversion. Approximate sensitivities are derived by replacing adjoint secondary electric fields with those computed in the previous iteration. These sensitivities can reduce computation time without significant loss of accuracy. First, we verified both our forward and inversion solutions. Then, we applied this approach to GREATEM survey data from Kujukuri Beach, central Japan. The inverted results of the field data were well fitted with previous study results in the Kujukuri area, suggesting applicability of this inversion approach for constructing 3-D resistivity models from GREATEM field survey data in the future.

MODIS gross primary production (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) products have been used to analyze the spatial and temporal patterns of WUE and their relationships with environmental factors at regional and global scales. Although MODIS GPP and ET products have been evaluated using eddy covariance flux measurements, the accuracy of WUE estimated from MODIS products has not been well quantified. In this paper, we evaluated WUE estimated from MODIS GPP and ET products against eddy covariance measurements of GPP and ET during 2003–2008 at eight sites of the Chinese flux observation and research network (ChinaFLUX) and conducted sensitivity analysis to investigate the possible key contributors to the bias of MODIS products. Results show that MODIS products underestimate eight-day water use efficiency in four forest ecosystems and one cropland ecosystem with the bias from −0.36–−2.28 g·C·kg−1 H2O, while overestimating it in three grassland ecosystems with the bias from 0.26–1.11 g·C·kg−1 H2O. Mean annual WUE was underestimated by 14%–54% at four forest sites, 45% at one OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2015, 7 11184 cropland site and 7% at an alpine grassland site, but overestimated by 66% and 9% at a temperate grassland site and an alpine meadow site, respectively. The underestimation of WUE by MODIS data results from underestimated GPP and overestimated ET at four forest sites, while MODIS WUE values are significantly overvalued mainly due to underestimated ET in the three grassland ecosystems. The maximum light use efficiency and fraction of photosynthetically-active radiation (FPAR) were the two most sensitive factors to the estimation of WUE derived from the MODIS GPP and ET algorithms. The error in meteorological data partly caused the overestimation of ET and accordingly underestimation in WUE in subtropical and tropical forests. The bias of MODIS-produced WUE was also derived from the uncertainties in eddy flux data due to gap-filling processes and unbalanced surface energy issue.

The technique is based on calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient (Rvalue) between rainfall errors and Kalman filter analysis increments realized during the assimilation of a remotely sensed soil moisture product into the antecedent precipitation index (API). Here, the existing Rvalue approach is modified by reformulating it to run on an anomaly basis where long-term seasonal trends are explicitly removed and by calculating API analysis increments using a Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother instead of a Kalman filter. This reformulated approach is then applied to a number of Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer soil moisture products acquired within three heavily instrumented watershed sites in the southern U.S. Rvalue -based evaluations of soil moisture products within these sites are verified based on comparisons with available ground-based soil moisture measurements. Results demonstrate that, without access to ground-based soil moisture measurements, the Rvalue methodology can accurately mimic anomaly correlation coefficients calculated between remotely sensed soil moisture products and soil moisture observations obtained from dense ground-based networks. Sensitivity results also indicate that the predictive skill of the Rvalue metric is enhanced by both proposed modifications to its methodology. Finally, Rvalue calculations are expanded to a quasi-global (50? S-50? N) domain using rainfall measurements derived from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission Precipitation Analysis. Spatial patterns in calculated Rvalue fields are compared to regions of strong land-atmosphere coupling and used to refine expectations concerning the global distribution of land areas in which remotely sensed surface soil moisture retrievals will contribute to atmospheric forecasting applications.	advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer;anomaly detection;coefficient;data assimilation;kalman filter;microwave;value (computer science);watershed (image processing)	Wade T.

00c5fd62292db2f53bf0aed29f2fc5e6a86e1b8b	quantifying seasonal patterns in disparate environmental variables using the polarmetrics r package		Certain environmental processes, while influential, are inherently difficult to quantify and detect using traditional time series analyses, particularly among variables with different seasonal progressions. Disturbances that only manifest in part of a season (e.g., spring defoliation) or subtle climate shifts can pose detection challenges when they occur in the presence of other variability. Increasing sampling rates or even adding new sensors may not reveal the anticipated patterns. Eddy covariance tower data are a useful example for which various environmental drivers influence the overall signal, contributing noise and seemingly discordant variation. While eddy flux data are a rich representation of information, distinguishing expected seasonal responses within a signal can be challenging, especially where drivers may have either fast or lagged responses. A conventional solution might be to analyze and effectively smooth the data over daily to monthly intervals. However, such smoothed data will not exhibit the same variance, and subsequent regressions may not isolate relationships and anomalies to specific seasons. This paper introduces and demonstrates the use of a newly developed R software package, PolarMetrics, which is used to analyze 20 years of data from one AmeriFlux tower using a polar (circular) approach that reduces data volume to a smaller set of derived seasonal timing and magnitude metrics. Polar metrics quantify the annual cycle of input variables, and permit direct comparison of the strength and timing of seasonality. While performing the analysis over all years produces a synoptic result, analyzing year-by-year characterizes interannual variability.	flux limiter;heart rate variability;r language;sampling (signal processing);seasonality;sensor;smoothing;spatial variability;spring framework;time series	Bjørn-Gustaf J.

1c5744996195dc46be3aa55180ebc7cf1e97f25f	a merging algorithm for regional snow mapping over eastern canada from avhrr and ssm/i data	optical and microwave satellite data;data fusion algorithm;snow cover;regional scale snow mapping;ssm i;avhrr;multisensory snow product	We present an algorithm for regional snow mapping that combines snow maps derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) data. This merging algorithm combines AVHRR’s moderate spatial resolution with SSM/I’s ability to penetrate clouds and, thus, benefits from the advantages of the two sensors while minimizing their limitations. First, each of the two detection algorithms were upgraded before developing the methodology to merge the snow mapping results obtained using both algorithms. The merging methodology is based on a membership function calculated over a temporal running window of ±4 days from the actual date. The studied algorithms were developed and tested over Eastern Canada for the period from 1988 to 1999. The snow mapping algorithm focused on the spring melt season (1 April to 31 May). The snow maps were validated using snow depth observations from meteorological stations. The overall accuracy of the merging algorithm is about 86%, which is between that of the new versions of the two individual algorithms: AVHRR (90%) and SSM/I (83%). Furthermore, the algorithm was able to locate the end date of the snowmelt season with reasonable accuracy (bias = 0 days; SD = 11 days). Comparison of mapping results with high spatial resolution snow cover from Landsat imagery demonstrates the feasibility of clear-sky snow mapping with relatively good accuracy despite some underestimation of snow extent inherited from the AVHRR algorithm. It was found that the detection limit of the algorithm is 80% snow cover within a 1 × 1 km pixel.

A challenge in validating albedo measurements acquired from space is the ability to overcome the spatial scaling errors that can produce disagreements between satellite and field-measured values. Here, we present the results from an accuracy assessment of MODIS and Landsat-TM albedo retrievals, based on collocated comparisons with tower and airborne Cloud Absorption Radiometer (CAR) measurements collected during the 2007 Cloud and Land Surface Interaction Campaign (CLASIC). The initial focus was on evaluating inter-sensor consistency through comparisons of intrinsic bidirectional reflectance estimates. Local and regional assessments were then performed to obtain estimates of the resulting scaling uncertainties, and to establish the accuracy of albedo reconstructions during extended periods of precipitation. In general, the satellite-derived estimates met the accuracy requirements established for the high-quality MODIS operational albedos at 500 m (the greater of 0.02 units or ±10% of surface measured values). However, results reveal a high degree of variability in the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and bias of MODIS visible (0.3-0.7 μm) and Landsat-TM shortwave (0.3-5.0 μm) albedos; where, in some cases, retrieval uncertainties were found to be in excess of 15 %. Results suggest that an overall improvement in MODIS shortwave albedo retrieval accuracy of 7.8%, based on comparisons between MODIS and CAR albedos, resulted from the removal of sub-grid scale mismatch errors when directly scaling-up the tower measurements to the MODIS satellite footprint.	airborne ranger;bidirectional reflectance distribution function;ecosystem;footprint (satellite);image scaling;information retrieval;offset binary;requirement;spatial variability	Miguel O.

33b942cfa9d4a79f36a9e5482e6275dd56310a95	assessment of tangible direct flood damage using a spatial analysis approach under the effects of climate change: case study in an urban watershed in hanoi, vietnam		Due to climate change, the frequency and intensity of Hydro-Meteorological disasters, such as floods, are increasing. Therefore, the main purpose of this work is to assess tangible future flood damage in the urban watershed of the To Lich River in Hanoi, Vietnam. An approach based on spatial analysis, which requires the integration of several types of data related to flood characteristics that include depth, in particular, land-use classes, property values, and damage rates, is applied for the analysis. To simulate the future scenarios of flooding, the effects of climate change and land-use changes are estimated for 2030. Additionally, two scenarios based on the implementation of flood control measures are analyzed to demonstrate the effect of adaptation strategies. The findings show that climate change combined with the expansion of built-up areas increases the vulnerability of urban areas to flooding and economic damage. The results also reveal that the impacts of climate change will increase the total damage from floods by 26%. However, appropriate flood mitigation will be helpful in reducing the impacts of losses from floods by approximately 8% with the restoration of lakes and by approximately 29% with the implementation of water-sensitive urban design (WSUD). This study will be useful in helping to identify and map flood-prone areas at local and regional scales, which can lead to the detection and prioritization of exposed areas for appropriate countermeasures in a timely manner. In addition, the quantification of flood damage can be an important indicator to enhance the awareness of local decision-makers on improving the efficiency of regional flood risk reduction strategies.	circuit restoration;flood;flood fill;image resolution;map;simulation;spatial analysis;watershed (image processing)	Mohamed Kefi;Binaya Kumar Mishra;Pankaj Kumar;Yoshifumi Masago;Kensuke Fukushi	2018	ISPRS Int.

21f76181d6e444191c0bd17b4093aaa7c83e191b	an adaptive method of non-stationary variogram modeling for dem error surface simulation	impact;uncertainty;social sciences;accuracy assessment;digital elevation models;geography	Geostatistical characterization of local DEM error is usually based on the assumption of a stationary variogram model which requires the mean and variance to be finite and constant in the area under investigation. However, in practice this assumption is appropriate only in a restricted spatial location, where the local experimental variograms vary slowly. Therefore, an adaptive method is developed in this article to model non-stationary variograms, for which the estimator and the indicator for characterization of spatial variation are a Voronoi map and the standard deviation of mean values displayed in the Voronoi map, respectively. For the adaptive method, the global domain is divided into different meshes with various sizes according to the variability of local variograms. The adaptive method of non-stationary variogram modeling is applied to simulating error surfaces of a LiDAR derived DEM located in Sichuan province, China. Results indicate that the locally adaptive variogram model is more accurate than the global one for capturing the characterization of spatial variation in DEM errors. The adaptive model can be considered as an alternative approach to modeling non-stationary variograms for DEM error surface simulation.	simulation;stationary process	Chuanfa Chen;Yanyan Li	2012	Trans.

Satellite measured vegetation greenness, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and relevant climate, land cover, and socioeconomic data since 1982 are analyzed using a multiple linear regression (MLR) method. A statistically significant positive trend of average growing-season (April–October) NDVI is found over more than 34% of the vegetated areas, mainly in North China, while significant decreases in NDVI are only seen in less than 5% of the areas. The relationships between vegetation and climate (temperature, precipitation, and radiation) vary by geographical location and vegetation type. We estimate the NDVI changes in association with the non-climatic effects by removing the climatic effects from the original NDVI time series using the MLR analysis. Our results indicate that land use change is the dominant factor driving the long-term changes in vegetation greenness. The significant greening in North China is due to the increase in crops, grasslands, and forests. The socioeconomic datasets provide consistent and supportive results for the non-climatic effects at the provincial level that afforestation and reduced fire events generally have a major contribution. This study provides a basis for quantifying the non-climatic effects due to possible human influences on the vegetation greening in China.	end-of-file;learning to rank;location (geography);simulation;time series;trend micro internet security	Wenjian Hua;Haishan Chen;Liming Zhou;Zhenghui Xie;Minhua Qin;Xing Li;Hedi Ma;Qinghan Huang;Shanlei Sun	2017	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs9050425	enhanced vegetation index;climatology;china;physics;remote sensing	ML	83.80927433603864	-56.60698444206363	172928

The Guiana Shield is a region vulnerable to high water episodes. Flood risk is enhanced by the concentration of population living along the main rivers. A good understanding of the regional hydro-climatic regime, as well as an accurate estimation of precipitation is therefore of great importance. Unfortunately, there are very few rain gauges available in the region. The objective of the study is then to compare satellite rainfall estimation products in order to complement the information available in situ and to perform a regional analysis of four operational precipitation estimates, by partitioning the whole area under study into a homogeneous hydro-climatic region. In this study, four satellite products have been tested, TRMM TMPA (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis) V7 (Version 7) and RT (real time), CMORPH (Climate Prediction Center (CPC) MORPHing technique) and PERSIANN (Precipitation Estimation from Remotely-Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Network), for daily rain gauge data. Product performance is evaluated at daily and monthly scales based on various intensities and hydro-climatic regimes from 1 January 2001 to 30 December 2012 and using quantitative statistical criteria (coefficient correlation, bias, relative bias and root mean square error) and quantitative error metrics (probability of detection for rainy days and for no-rain days and the false alarm ratio). Over the entire study period, all products underestimate precipitation. The results obtained in terms of the hydro-climate show that for areas with intense convective precipitation, TMPA V7 shows a better performance than other products, especially in the estimation of extreme precipitation events. In regions along the Amazon, the use of PERSIANN is better. Finally, in the driest areas, TMPA V7 and PERSIANN show the same performance.	artificial neural network;cartesian perceptual compression;coefficient;exec shield;federal enterprise architecture;galileo (satellite navigation);mean squared error;morphing;performance;version 7 unix	Justine Ringard;Melanie Becker;Frédérique Seyler;Laurent Linguet	2015	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs71215831	meteorology;quantitative precipitation estimation;hydrology;remote sensing	ML	84.70893459522362	-58.57688957193859	172958
a2bdc1feb2951a5cf8af4dc69ea1f965d5e4b788	the effect of dem raster resolution on first order, second order and compound terrain derivatives	second order	It is well known that the grid cell size of a raster digital elevation model has significant effects on derived terrain variables such as slope, aspect, plan and profile curvature or the wetness index. In this paper the quality of DEMs derived from the interpolation of photogrammetrically derived elevation points in Alberta, Canada, is tested. DEMs with grid cell sizes ranging from 100 to 5 m were interpolated from 100 m regularly spaced elevation points and numerous surface-specific point elevations using the ANUDEM interpolation method. In order to identify the grid resolution that matches the information content of the source data, three approaches were applied: density analysis of point elevations, an analysis of cumulative frequency distributions using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the root mean square slope measure. Results reveal that the optimum grid cell size is between 5 and 20 m, depending on terrain complexity and terrain derivative. Terrain variables based on 100 m regularly sampled elevation points are compared to an independent high-resolution DEM used as a benchmark. Subsequent correlation analysis reveals that only elevation and local slope have a strong positive relationship while all other terrain derivatives are not represented realistically when derived from a coarse DEM. Calculations of root mean square errors and relative root mean square errors further quantify the quality of terrain derivatives.	benchmark (computing);digital elevation model;image resolution;interpolation;mean squared error;photogrammetry;self-information;source data;terrain rendering	Stefan Kienzle	2004	Trans.

Although fishing has been increasing over decades, fisheries sustainability has not been assessed. We used the ISIS-Fish tool to build a spatially-explicit dynamic model for two major fish resources: spangled emperor and coral trout. The model was constructed and parameterized from many existing data habitat, fish populations, and fishing pressures. After calibration, it was used to simulate the outcomes of several management scenarios including MPA, size limitation, and increase in commercial fisher number. Results showed that depending on the species, an MPA could result in a significant resource increase within its boundaries. Size limitation highly reduced line fishing catches, but its benefits depended on the survival rate of released fish. Increasing the number of commercial fishers significantly affected spangled emperor but not coral trout.

Desertification and its spatio-temporal evolution information are very important to confirm stratagem and measure of desertification and implement macro-management effectively, which is helpful to promote environmental resources sustainable development. Remote sensing has been shown to be a powerful tool in monitoring and assessment desertification. This paper focuses on reviewing the theory and methodology of monitoring and assessment desertification by using high resolution remotely sensed data. On the basis of these theories and methods, the desertification in some counties at Hunshandake sandy desertification area was evaluated. The result indicates that quantitative monitoring and assessment of desertification in large area can be carried out by using high resolution remotely sensed image. It is vital to take reasonable estimation principle, establish scientific evaluation index and remotely sensed image interpreter symbol system, constitute feasible sand desertification classification project, and make use of appropriate interpreter means and technique routes. Compared with and the result from the low-resolution data, the evaluation to this method is more accurate, specific and valuable in application. The result of this method to evaluate regional desertification at Hunshandake desertification area indicates that, from 1970s, the acreage and proportion of the desertification at this area has augmented significantly, and the situation of sandy desertification is very serious.	image resolution	Jianjun Wu;Hong Xia;Yani Liu	2004	IGARSS 2004. 2004 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2004.1369746	image resolution;hydrology;remote sensing	EDA	83.04624445941123	-55.76106990910435	173282

We investigated visible and near infrared (Vis/NIR) spectroscopy combined with chemometrics for the fast and nondestructive determination of nutritional information in oilseed rape leaves. A total of 154 leaf samples were collected, with 104 randomly selected as the calibration set, and the remaining 50 samples used as the validation set. The performance of eight different preprocessing methods was compared in partial least squares (PLS) models. Some effective wavelengths selected by a successive projections algorithm (SPA) were also used to develop linear SPA-PLS, nonlinear back propagation neural network (BPNN), and nonlinear least squares-support vector machine (LS-SVM) models to determine nutritional information. The best prediction models were DOSC-PLS for nitrogen with r=0.9743 and RMSEP=0.1459, DOSC-SPA-BPNN for phosphorus with r=0.7054 and RMSEP=0.0594, and DOSC-SPA-BPNN for potassium with r=0.9380 and RMSEP=0.1788. The prediction precision for nitrogen and potassium determinations was acceptable for further practical applications, whereas further studies are needed to improve the prediction precision for phosphorus. The results indicated that Vis/NIR spectroscopy is feasible for nondestructive determination of nutritional information in oilseed rape leaves. It also provided an alternative technique for detecting other growth information about oilseed rape leaves.	algorithm;artificial neural network;backpropagation;chemometrics;least squares support vector machine;non-linear least squares;nonlinear system;partial least squares regression;preprocessor;randomness;sensor;software propagation;test set;visual instruction set	Fei Liu;Pengcheng Nie;Min Huang;Wenwen Kong;Yong He	2011	Science China Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-011-4198-7	near-infrared spectroscopy;computer science;machine learning;chemometrics	ML	87.4899477104523	-53.539065168892584	173405
9eed515a55f24edc68fe25091ca173d325beded2	polarimetric alos palsar time series in mapping biomass of boreal forests		Here, we examined multitemporal behavior of fully polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) parameters at L-band in relation to the stem volume of boreal forests. The PolSAR parameters were evaluated in terms of their temporal consistency, inter-dependence and suitability for forest stem volume estimation across several seasonal conditions (frozen, thaw and unfrozen). The satellite SAR data were represented by a time series of PolSAR images acquired during several seasons in the years 2006 to 2009 by the ALOS PALSAR sensor. The study area was in central Finland, and represented a managed area in typical boreal mixed forest land. Utility of different PolSAR parameters, their temporal stability and cross-correlations were studied along with reference stand-level stem volume data from forest inventory. Further, two polarimetric parameters, cross-polarization backscatter and co-polarization coherence, were chosen for further investigation and stem volume retrieval. A relationship between forest stem volume and PolSAR parameters was established using the kNN regression approach. Ways of optimally combining PolSAR images were evaluated as well. For a single scene, best results were observed with polarimetric coherence (RMSE ≈ 38.8 m3/ha) for scene acquired in frozen conditions. An RMSE of 40.8 m3/ha (42.9%, R2 = 0.66) was achieved for cross-polarization backscatter in the best case. Cross-polarization backscatter was a better predictor than polarimetric coherence for few summer scenes. Multitemporal aggregation of selected PolSAR scenes improved estimates for both studied PolSAR parameters. Stronger improvement was observed for coherence with RMSE down to 34 m3/ha (35.8%, R2 = 0.77) compared to 38.8–51.6 m3/ha (40.8–54.3%) from separate scenes. Finally, the accuracy statistics reached RMSE of 32.2 m3/ha (34%, R2 = 0.79) when multitemporal HHVV coherence was combined with multitemporal HV-backscatter.

The smoothing of altimetric measurements has an application much broader than just the regular production of elevation maps for oceanographers, however. In particular, the ability to estimate ocean circulation patterns from altimetric data can serve as an important measure for the verification of ocean acoustic tomographic results. The authors present a multiscale technique capable of extremely efficient interpolation of altimetric data: about 256000 estimates and estimation error variances are computed in one minute on a Sun Sparc-10. They also demonstrate how similar techniques may be used to directly estimate the surface gradient and biases in the geoid-model error.	data assimilation;multiresolution analysis	Paul W. Fieguth;W.

However due to cloud masks, there is a great need to apply Aqua data as a complement for Terra data. Therefore, the relationships between Terra-derived and Aqua-derived NDVI values are required to continued long-term monitoring of land surface properties. Here,NDVI product suites, containing the Terra 16-day,Aqua 16-day over one selected MODIS tile (1200times1200 km) including a variety of vegetation cover types in northwestern China were compared over the same time periods of 2004 and 2005. Additionally, several daily cloudless data of 2005 in the region were chosen for research. The results indicate there were subtle discrepancies between NDVI values derived from the two sensors. But there were no significant discrepancies. The results suggest that Aqua data is good complement for Terra data and available for operational product to monitor vegetation.	aqua;sensor	Jing Wang;Ni Guo;Xiaoping Wang;Jia Yang	2007	2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423572	meteorology;enhanced vegetation index;normalized difference vegetation index;geology;hydrology;physics;vegetation;remote sensing	Visualization	83.50029014844614	-59.18783725257254	173802

These indices were correlated with cereal yield and critical periods of crop development were found as significant for this relationship. The information about indices from particle decades was included into the cereals and winter wheat yield modelling. The database of the indices and obtained statistical models were used for developing the Predictive Indices (PTVCI, PTAVCI, VCIAVG) applied for the forecast of yield for each decade of the year.

It is frequently used as a baseline metric to measure yield efficiency in precision farming. A major challenge in mapping yield for specialty crops is how to collect accurate yield data without incurring substantial overhead to a farming operation. We design a yield efficiency analysis system that uses a cloud-based computing platform to acquire and analyze yield data. By reusing labor data collected by a cloud-based labor monitoring system that we developed earlier, our system calculates yield data from labor data, and computes yield map in real time and without the overhead for data acquisition. A distinctive feature of our approach is the introduction of a customizable yield distribution function that quantifies the probability of geographic distribution of fruits weighted at a Labor Monitoring Device. Practitioners may define yield distribution functions based on operational characteristics of an orchard, enabling our system adaptive for a variety of orchards with different harvesting operations and canopy architecture. Using a multi-tenancy software architecture, our system can support multiple orchards concurrently with improved scalability and data privacy.

The purpose is to model SMC with respect to use segregation (useg), temperature, and the intensity of local solar radiation that causes polarization of electromagnetic radiation (EMR). The objectives include using basic laws of radiation to assess how radiation intimately interacts with matter. The methodology consists of four method spaces dealing with: polarization of dielectric medium; hysteresis accounting for the rhythms of polarization and relaxation time; validation of temperature effects on polarization and medium susceptibility; and the nesting of the medium complex dielectric permittivity to its void capacity (n v) or the Boolean Space (BS). Solar radiation impinging on the soil a dielectric medium, is a form of EMR that generates mechanisms of charge displacement (polarizations). The study found that BS approach can adequately be a predictor resource under the ideal temperature.	polarization (waves)	Sam O.

This can cause errors, not only in the measurement of the satellite altitude, but also in the determination of wind speed and wave height. TOPEX/Poseidon dual-frequency altimeter data (cycles 3 and 8) were searched for instances where the data were possibly degraded by the presence of rain over the North and inter-Tropical Atlantic. A subjective analysis of the data, similar to the one used in previous studies was conducted on the backscatter coefficient, wind speed, significant wave height, sea surface height, TOPEX Microwave Radiometer (TMR) brightness temperatures, liquid water content and data quality flags to identify the orbits possibly affected by rain. From the 105 probable rain events identified, the effects of rain on the TOPEX measurements and data quality parameters were characterized. The strong differential effect of rain on the Ku and C band measurements was then used to define a new rain flag based on a departure from the normal relationship between the C and Ku band backscatter. This new rain flag was shown to detect all the identified rain events, as well as new ones. The TMR rain flag, used operationally, was shown to flag too many altimeter samples and too few rain events, mainly because of its large resolution (few tens of kilometers compared to few kilometers for the altimeter). An estimation of the rainfall rate from the attenuation of the Ku band backscatter was proposed.	backscatter (email);coefficient;data quality;emoticon;ku band;l band;mean squared error;microwave;triple modular redundancy	Jean Tournadre;June Morland	1997	IEEE Trans.

Firstly, uncertainties in the models input data, i.e. hourly rainfall, monthly potential evapotranspiration, catchment size and daily surface pathogen deposition rates, were assessed. Random and systematic sources of errors were taken into account. It was found that systematic errors in rainfall and random errors in pathogen deposition rates have the biggest impact on uncertainty in the models output.		S. Haydon;A.

The quality of the visualisations using our flow visualisation tool, are compared with animations generated using more traditional drogue release plot and velocity contour and vector techniques. The texture-based method is found to be far more effective in visualising advective flow within the model domain.

A dataset of ten Thematic Mapper (TM) images, from 1988–1997, was used to select three test points based on the analysis of the temporal stability of the reflectance of Salar’s surface. Bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) values of Salar’s surface within the precision suitable for vicarious calibration procedures were obtained using a CE313-2/CIMEL radiometer. In spite of seeming visually homogeneous, the BRF values of one test point have presented significative statistical differences with the two others. Atmospheric characterization was possible with a sunphotometer CE317/CIMEL showing the low importance of the atmospheric effects in the image acquisition. The results confirm that the Salar de Uyuni has the characteristics pointed out by many authors as suitable for a vicarious calibration site, specially from April to November because of the reduced rainfall occurrence. The main disadvantages are the difficult access and the critical period for data collecting in the rainy season from November to March. An angular reflectance variation study is recommended in order to evaluate its Lambertian properties.	angularjs;lambertian reflectance;mapper;test point	Rubens A. C.

However, in practice, carrier phase observations often include various errors besides essential parameters. Sometimes even satellite signals may be temporarily interrupted and lead to cycle slips. Most of errors can be eliminated with differencing of carrier phase observation. But phase center offsets (PCOs) are a key source of errors in GPS precise measurements and hardly eliminated or weakened by difference methods. Meanwhile as a gross error, cycle slips decreases badly positioning accuracy but can’t remove by differencing approach. For all this, based on the feature of cycle slips and time series analysis theory, a quickly and convenient method of eliminating various errors, detecting and correcting cycle slips and PCOs is presented in this paper for high accuracy positioning solution. The key of this method is to build difference series between carrier phase observations of satellites, stations and epochs. These difference series can be used to eliminate various errors implied in observation data, and highlight the features of cycle slips. Based on the time-series analysis theory, the model of difference series of carrier phase observation data is built, cycle slips can be quickly detected by the stability of this time series. At last, the experiment results show that the new method can not only be suitable both for static and dynamic measurements of dual-frequency GPS receivers, but also can eliminate most measurement errors of dual-frequency GPS receivers, improve the efficiency of detection and correction of PCOs and cycle slips less than 1 cycle.	autoregressive integrated moving average;difference polynomials;epoch (reference date);global positioning system;interrupt;sensor;time series	Zhige Jia;Zhengsong Chen;Dijin Wang;Pengfei Yu	2016	Cluster Computing	10.1007/s10586-016-0607-4	telecommunications;time series	HCI	90.40606570685058	-61.270869566154374	176314

However, variable forest stand densities limit the performance of the allometric estimation of AGB from height measurements alone. Recently, the use of vertical forest structure information as an indicator for the variation of stand density has been proposed and used to improve the allometric estimation of AGB from height measurements. In this letter, the use of vertical radar reflectivity profiles at L-band obtained from SAR tomography, as a proxy for vertical forest structure for the allometric estimation of AGB, is investigated. L-band reflectivity profiles, which are reconstructed from data at different polarizations (HH and HV) and acquired under “moist” and “dry” weather conditions, are investigated. The proposed allometric AGB estimator increases the correlation factor from 0.60 to 0.81 and reduces the root-mean-square error from 50.25 to 36.30 Mg/ha when compared with the AGB estimation from forest height alone. The effect of polarization and weather conditions on the AGB estimation performance is discussed.	l band;polarization (waves);random forest;reflection coefficient;tomography	Astor Toraño Caicoya;Matteo Pardini;Irena Hajnsek;Konstantinos P.

1d33e986af832b35668dffa63e4705de085a42fb	water quality prediction based on wavelet neural networks and remote sensing		Wavelet artificial neural networks and remote sensing techniques can be used to estimate water quality variables such as Chlorophyll-a, turbidity and suspended solids. This paper describes empirical algorithms for the estimation of these variables incorporating information from the Operational Land Imager Sensor on board the Landsat-8 satellite. Neural networks are seasonally trained using data from the Cefni reservoir (Anglesey, U.K.), covering a variety of physical trophic status. Chlorophyll-a levels and the suspended solids are estimated from the reflectance in band-2 and band-4, while the turbidity values from reflectance in band-4. Experimental results show the potential of Landsat-8 as a substitute of Landsat-7 in water bodies quality monitoring. Moreover, predicted values obtained by using wavelet artificial neural networks fit well measured data and hence, such models provide accurate results therefore improving the efficiency in monitoring water quality parameters and contributing to possible decision making processes in the environmental management.	algorithm;approximation;environmental resource management;image sensor;neural networks;trophic function;wavelet	Humberto A.

An inversion approach to estimate moisture characteristics from SAR data is applied. The method requires that a priori information on forest biomass (stem volume) and soil type distribution is available. The inversion technique provides estimates that are here, in addition to backscattering signatures, directly compared with daily in situ moisture values. The results indicate that time-series of C-band radar observations can be used for the monitoring of boreal forest moisture variations. Especially, the detection of the driest and the wettest conditions on mineral soil sites appears to be a feasible application even for single channel radar. The obtained SAR-based soil moisture estimates showed an RMSE level of 6% units against the in situ data for pine-dominated mineral soil sites.	motorola canopy;radar;time series;type signature	Jouni Pulliainen;Pertti Hari;Martti Hallikainen;Niina Patrikainen;Martti Perämäki;Pasi Kolari	2004	IGARSS 2004. 2004 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2004.1368582	water content;data processing;hydrology;soil science;remote sensing	Embedded	82.99645569768994	-60.89664145988113	176827

In consideration of great deal of data to process, in case of saturation of physical resources, the system is able to start virtual machines on demand in order to solve temporary peak processing due saturation grid system.	algorithm;global positioning system;radio occultation;virtual machine	Olivier Terzo;Lorenzo Mossucca;Pietro Ruiu;Giuseppe Caragnano	2011	2011 International Conference on P2P, Parallel, Grid, Cloud and Internet Computing	10.1109/3PGCIC.2011.23	embedded system;real-time computing;simulation;engineering	HPC	88.40747327053123	-60.494917515745584	176841
0938de75ece70fd62b6b6b0746abf70d9c620136	a detection problem: sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of a land surface temperature approach to detecting dynamics of water use by groundwater-dependent vegetation	uncertainty analysis;surface energy balance modelling;sensitivity analysis;land surface temperature;groundwater dependent vegetation	Sustainable management of groundwater-dependent vegetation (GDV) requires the accurate identification of GDVs, characterisation of their water use dynamics and an understanding of associated errors. This paper presents sensitivity and uncertainty analyses of one GDV mapping method which uses temperature differences between time-series of modelled and observed land surface temperature (LST) to detect groundwater use by vegetation in a subtropical woodland. Uncertainty in modelled LST was quantified using the Jacobian method with error variances obtained from literature. Groundwater use was inferred where modelled and observed LST were significantly different using a Student's t-test. Modelled LST was most sensitive to low-range wind speeds (<1.5 m s−1), low-range vegetation height (<=0.5 m), and low-range leaf area index (<=0.5 m2 m−2), limiting the detectability of groundwater use by vegetation under such conditions. The model-data approach was well-suited to detection of GDV because model-data errors were lowest for climatic conditions conducive to groundwater use.	sensor	L. J. Gow;Damian J. Barrett;Luigi J.

Coupled landeatmosphere systems that can realistically represent these interactions are thus critical for improving our understanding of the atmosphere-biosphere exchanges of energy, water, and their associated feedbacks. NASA’s Land Information System (LIS) is a high-resolution land data assimilation system that integrates advanced land surface models, high-resolution satellite and observational data, data assimilation techniques, and high performance computing tools. LIS has been coupled to the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, enabling a high-resolution landeatmosphere modeling system. Synthetic simulations using the coupled LISeWRF system demonstrates the interoperable use of land surface models, high-resolution land surface data and other land surface modeling tools through LIS. Real case study simulations for a June 2002 International H2O Project (IHOP) day is conducted by executing LIS first in an uncoupled manner to generate high-resolution soil moisture and soil temperature initial conditions. During the case study period, the land surface (LIS) and the atmospheric (WRF) models are executed in a coupled manner using the LISeWRF system. The results from the simulations illustrate the impact of accurate, high-resolution land surface conditions on improving the prediction of clouds and precipitation. Thus, the coupled LISeWRF system provides a testbed to enable studies in improving our understanding and predictability of regional and global water and energy cycles. 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, the feasibility of the method is discussed based on MODIS data and archetypal BRDFs. The BRDF is simplified into six archetypal BRDFs that represent different reflectance anisotropies. Five-year time series of MODIS BRDF data over three tiles are classified into six BRDF archetype classes according to the Anisotropy Flat indeX (AFX). The percentage of each BRDF archetype class in different land cover classes or every 0.1-NDVI interval is determined. Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectances (NBARs) and NDVIs simulated from different archetypal BRDFs and the same multi-angular observations are compared to MODIS results to study the effectiveness of the method. The results show that one land cover type, or every 0.1-NDVI interval, contains all the potential BRDF shapes and that one BRDF archetypal class makes up no more than 40% of all data. Moreover, the differences between the NBARs and NDVIs simulated from different archetypal BRDFs are insignificant. In terms of the archetypal BRDF method and MODIS BRDF product, this study indicates that the land cover or NDVI is not necessarily related to surface reflectance anisotropy.	afx windows rootkit 2003;angularjs;bidirectional reflectance distribution function;curse of dimensionality;time series	Hu Zhang;Ziti Jiao;Yadong Dong;Peng Du;Yang Li;Yi Lian;Tiejun Cui	2016	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs8121004	meteorology;normalized difference vegetation index;hydrology;physics;remote sensing	Graphics	85.30714744685295	-60.891209846823855	177501

The data set consists of 24-120 h daily precipitation forecasts from five state-of-the-art global circulation models (GCMs), i.e., European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (Europe), National Center for Environmental Prediction (USA), China Meteorological Administration (China), Canadian Meteorological Centre (Canada) and U.K. Meteorological Office (U.K.). The DMS-MME forecasts are constructed during the monsoon months (JJAS) for the years 2008-13 over the Indian mainland. For the training and verification purposes, India Meteorological Department rainfall is used. The forecast skill of the DMS-MME model has been compared with the performance of individual models and regression-based MME model. Further, to remove the nonnormality of rainfall distribution, square-root and logarithmic transfer functions are used for normalizing the precipitation data. The impact of these transfer functions on the forecast skill of the DMS-MME model has been assessed. The forecast skill of the proposed model is evaluated using the standard statistical measures. DMS-MME forecasts carries higher skill in terms of verification scores compared with the MME forecasts up to 120 h. It has been found that using the DMS-MME approach with a square-root transfer function (SDMS-MME) gives the best results. SDMS-MME outperforms the operational models and the regression-based MME at all forecast steps.	archive;coefficient;dynamical system;edi;ensemble forecasting;enterprise test software;model selection;nash equilibrium;physical symbol system;transfer function;usc interactive media & games division;wiki	Swati Bhomia;Neeru Jaiswal;Chandra M.

c34cb32f59318c8fc5db6e02b77ecb54e78e129f	improving mesoscale altimetric data from a multitracer convolutional processing of standard satellite-derived products		Multisatellite measurements of altimeter-derived sea surface height (SSH) have provided a wealth of information on the ocean. Yet, horizontal scales below 100 km remain scarcely resolved. Especially, in the Mediterranean Sea, an important fraction of the mesoscale range, characterized by a small Rossby radius of deformation of 15–20 km, is not properly retrieved by altimeter-derived gridded products. Here, we investigate a novel processing of AVISO products with a view to resolving the horizontal scales sensed by current along-track altimeter data. The key feature of our framework is the use of linear convolutional operators to model the fine-scale SSH detail as a function of different sea surface fields, especially optimally interpolated SSH and sea surface temperature (SST). The proposed model embeds the surface quasi-geostrophic SST–SSH synergy as a special case. Using an observing system simulation experiment with simulated SSH data from model outputs in the Western Mediterranean Sea, we show that the proposed approach has the potential for improving current optimal interpolations of gridded altimeter-derived SSH fields by more than 20% in terms of relative SSH and kinetic energy mean square error, as well as in terms of spectral signatures for horizontal scales ranging from 30 to 100 km. Our results also suggest that SST–SSH relationship may only play a secondary role compared with the interscale SSH cascade. We further discuss the relevance of the proposed approach in the context of future altimetric satellite missions.	interpolation;mean squared error;relevance;simulation;synergy;type signature	Ronan Fablet;Jacques Verron;Baptiste Mourre;Bertrand Chapron;Ananda Pascual	2018	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2017.2750491	sea-surface height;remote sensing;mathematics;atmospheric model;climatology;mediterranean sea;sea surface temperature;special case;rossby radius of deformation;mesoscale meteorology;ranging	Visualization	85.33868789881322	-62.99072853226282	178535

However, this figure is not compatible with the high accuracy of 0.3 K required by climate studies. Biases in the SST product, arising when the factors that increase the optical path-length (absorbents concentration in the atmosphere or viewing angles) are large, cause problems in the use of the split-window formulation for climate monitoring. The reason is that the split-window coefficients currently used are not adequate to cover for all the atmospheric variability. To show this, simulations of channels 4 and 5 of AVHRR/2 of NOAA-11 using a radiative transfer model have been made. The range of atmospheric conditions and surface temperatures introduced in the simulation covers the variability of these parameters on a worldwide scale. From these data, the authors present new split-window coefficients that take into account the atmospheric variability through the ratio of the channel transmittances, or else through the total water vapor content along the path. They also show, using simulated and actual data, that the proposed split-window algorithm has a real global character and represents an improvement over the conventional algorithms. >	algorithm	José A.

42a12adfa3ff4db16e50dd7d0ac862ab1a68a436	modeling the toa brightness temperature on the swir-sensors		Creation of maps of surface temperature distribution based on satellite imagery data is becoming increasingly important throughout the past decade and is relevant for a number of studies. This paper presents the values of the coefficients and expressions for calculating the brightness temperature on the SWIR sensors of Landsat-8, Sentinel-2A/B and WorldView-3, nearest to the TIR-range. Two methods for modeling the brightness temperature on SWIR sensors, which have some similarity in values with TIR-temperature data, are considered. In experiments on the test multispectral data, a spread of temperatures of up to 20 K was obtained for certain types of ground cover. In this study, the first method, based on control points for certain types of surfaces, yielded a result with a smaller spread of values (no more than 2 K for certain types of surfaces). The second method was based on the use of multispectral indices for improving the accuracy of simulation results.	coefficient;control point (mathematics);experiment;multispectral image;sensor;simulation;time of arrival	Igor N.

For wind speeds less than 15 m/s, SAR-buoy wind speed comparisons show biases less than 1 m/s with standard deviations less than 2.5 m/s. For wind speeds from 15 to 25 m/s, SAR wind measurements have a positive bias above 2 m/s and somewhat more scatter when compared to buoy winds. For winds larger than 25 m/s, the accuracy of SAR winds is not well known. Very few buoy matches are available. Comparisons of SAR winds with hurricane model winds and aircraft measurements are still in a preliminary stage, but indicate that improved algorithms are needed.	algorithm;aperture (software);castle of the winds;synthetic data;tropical cyclone forecast model;velocity	William Pichel;Xiaofeng Li;Frank M.

df88098a5dee3a997128b2cc4b8480c7b46c08e9	analysis of hydrological sensitivity for flood risk assessment		In order for the Indian government to maximize Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM), the Brahmaputra River has played an important role in the undertaking of the Pilot Basin Study (PBS) due to the Brahmaputra River’s annual regional flooding. The selected Kulsi River—a part of Brahmaputra sub-basin—experienced severe floods in 2007 and 2008. In this study, the Rainfall-Runoff-Inundation (RRI) hydrological model was used to simulate the recent historical flood in order to understand and improve the integrated flood risk management plan. The ultimate objective was to evaluate the sensitivity of hydrologic simulation using different Digital Elevation Model (DEM) resources, coupled with DEM smoothing techniques, with a particular focus on the comparison of river discharge and flood inundation extent. As a result, the sensitivity analysis showed that, among the input parameters, the RRI model is highly sensitive to Manning’s roughness coefficient values for flood plains, followed by the source of the DEM, and then soil depth. After optimizing its parameters, the simulated inundation extent showed that the smoothing filter was more influential than its simulated discharge at the outlet. Finally, the calibrated and validated RRI model simulations agreed well with the observed discharge and the Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-detected flood extents.	algorithm;differential gps;digital elevation model;discharger;flood;matthews correlation coefficient;noise reduction;risk assessment;risk management plan;shuttle radar topography mission;simulation;smoothing;typset and runoff;usgs dem	Sanjay Kumar Sharma;Young-Joo Kwak;Rakesh Kumar;Bibhash Sarma	2018	ISPRS Int.

From this data set the cross-polarized signals showed no evident loss of sensitivity as the wind-speed increased from 20 m/s up to 45 m/s. On the contrary C-band co-polar backscatter suffered from problems of incidence and azimuth angle-dependent signal saturations and dampening which makes it weakly sensitive above 25 m/s. On the basis of these considerations there are good reasons to think that the cross-polarized data can be a valuable tool for the retrieval of strong-to-severe wind speeds for future scatterometers. In this paper we present a physical scattering model based on the Small Slope Approximation theory [2] in conjunction with the Vector Radiative Transfer Theory [3] to describe the behavior of cross-polar scattering from ocean as function of the wind-speed and direction.

As we all know, the 73 dataset have different precision with air-borne and space-borne images and there are different in application and theory.

For agro-based country like India, this may further deteriorate the circumstances, thereby urging for precise quantification. This paper is about the application of meteorological drought indices namely Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Effective Drought Index (EDI) and Percent Normal Precipitation Index (PNPI) over Marathwada division, Maharashtra, India. The 3-hourly (0.25° × 0.25°) gridded rainfall data is collected from Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP) product for 1979–2014 and is converted to monthly temporal scale. All the three indices give similar results in meteorological drought characterization i.e., most parts of the Marathwada division are affected by frequent moderate or severe droughts while some parts have witnessed extreme drought conditions.

This paper concentrates on the models ability to represent the transport and deposition of atmospheric pollution in North Sea coastal areas. Comparisons to NO""""2 and PM""""1""""0 measurements at selected sites of the Co-operative Program for Monitoring and Evaluation of the Long-range Transmission of Air Pollutants in Europe (EMEP) are used for quality control for atmospheric concentrations. We use modeled nitrogen deposition fields and EMEP wet deposition measurements during January and July 2001 as a measure to evaluate the deposition schemes. Close agreement between the model and the measurements was found for the oxidised nitrogen compounds in January, when on average NO""""2 was overestimated by 18% (measured: 3.52@mgN/m^3, modeled: 4.16@mgN/m^3) and nitrate deposition was only slightly underestimated by 2%. However, ammonia was underestimated by 44%. In July, NO""""2 levels are much lower than in January and the model underestimates the mean concentration by 35% (measured 1.49@mgN/m^3, modeled 0.97@mgN/m^3). Wet deposition is also underestimated, but again the results for nitrate (-38%) were in better agreement with the measurements than for ammonium (-57%). PM""""1""""0 concentrations are largely underestimated in January and July (by about 65% on average), but this result was expected, because only anthropogenic emissions were considered. Nevertheless, especially in January high daily correlations (0.69-0.84) between the modeled dry PM""""1""""0 and the measurements in Germany were found. This indicates that the aerosol transport pathways are captured quite well by the model. CMAQ has been expanded to represent also persistent organic pollutants (POPs). In this paper first results of deposition fields of the carcinogenic benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) are shown. Preliminary comparisons to air concentration and deposition measurements show that the model results are in the right order of magnitude. In particular the observed strong seasonal cycle of B(a)P in air was also present in the model."""	cmaq	V. Matthias;A. Aulinger;M.

However, for certain hazard types, this may be mostly a result of increasing population exposure due to phenomenal global population growth, especially in the most hazardous areas. We investigate temporal changes in potential global population exposure and impacts from earthquakes in the XXth century. Spatial analysis is used to combine historical population distributions with a seismic intensity map. Changes in number of victims were also analyzed, while controlling for the progress in frequency and magnitude of hazard events. There is also a focus on mega-cities and implications of fast urbanization for exposure and risk. Results illustrate the relevance of population growth and exposure for risk assessment and disaster outcome, and underline the need for conducting detailed global mapping of settlements and population distribution.	population;relevance;risk assessment;spatial analysis	Sérgio Freire;Daniele Ehrlich;Stefano Ferri	2014			geography;environmental planning;human settlement;natural hazard;population growth;population distributions;risk assessment;population;vulnerability;urbanization	Web+IR	83.28625626486088	-54.838556836783006	179785
920cdc5a6e7513cc9fab89b55b79ead4a37aadc9	use of a digital camera as alternative method for non-destructive detection of the leaf chlorophyll content and the nitrogen nutrition status in wheat		Abstract In this paper, the use of a digital consumer camera for the non-destructive detection of the N nutritional status is compared with two alternative methods, namely SPAD and reflectance spectrometry in three field experiments. The image analysis method consisted of segmentation and successive analysis of the foreground color, i.e. only green plant parts. Thus, also analysis of canopies with small degree of ground cover is possible. All methods gave comparable results, while the effort necessary was considerably higher when using the chlorophyll meter. With spectral measurements, the biomass and leaf nitrogen content could not be clearly differentiated; chlorophyll measurements do not reflect biomass, whereas the described procedure of image analysis permits the consideration both. If used properly, digital image analysis is a valuable tool for the determination of the N nutrition status under field conditions, with low costs and labor requirements.	digital camera	Jörg Peter Baresel;Pablo Rischbeck;Yuncai Hu;Sebastian Kipp;Gero Barmeier;Bodo Mistele;Urs Schmidhalter	2017	Computers and Electronics in Agriculture	10.1016/j.compag.2017.05.032	engineering;digital camera;computer vision;artificial intelligence;remote sensing;metre (music);digital image analysis;chlorophyll;nitrogen;reflectivity;segmentation;biomass	HCI	85.49148541925717	-53.330291413364925	179901

e88bb39786c11bda937d814b47e7ce60fd5828e3	mine water inrush sources online discrimination model using fluorescence spectrum and cnn		Mine water inrush disasters served as severe accidents in China cause severe economic losses and threaten the safety of coal mine production. The existing mine water sources discrimination methods have to let miners collect water samples of different place in situ, which make dynamic online analysis virtually impossible. This paper proposes a novel inrush water source discrimination model using laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) technology and convolution neural network (CNN) to achieve mines inrush water source online discrimination which can reduce humankind involvement. Experiment collected 161 items water samples of four different water sources of Xinji No. 2 coal mine. The LIF auto launched 405-nm lasers into water samples to calculate reflected fluorescence spectra. An improved smoothing method is proposed to reduce high-frequency random fluctuations of fluorescence spectra and further to compute auto-correlation fluorescence spectra features. Based on CNN frame and spectra features, mine waters source online discrimination model is constructed. Experiment randomly selected 80 percent of samples of all for training CNN model, the remaining for testing the proposed model. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the recognition rate of the proposed method achieves 98%.This method is an effective assessment method to discriminate inrush water source types of mines. It provides a new train of thought to solve online discriminant inrush water source types of mines.	artificial neural network;autocorrelation;convolution;discriminant;low insertion force;randomness;smoothing	Yong Yang;Jianhua Yue;Jing Li;Zhong Yang	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2866506	convolutional neural network;smoothing;coal mining;inrush current;computer science;distributed computing;artificial intelligence;water resources;pattern recognition	AI	87.33532591748387	-53.83174024967241	180885
22683e0b2d438d9f9d2bfa6e5033344f5981e981	landsat time series analysis of fractional plant cover changes on abandoned energy development sites		Abstract Oil and natural gas development in the western United States has increased substantially in recent decades as technological advances like horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing have made extraction more commercially viable. Oil and gas pads are often developed for production, and then capped, reclaimed, and left to recover when no longer productive. Understanding the rates, controls, and degree of recovery of these reclaimed well sites to a state similar to pre-development conditions is critical for energy development and land management decision processes. Here we use a multi-decadal time series of satellite imagery (Landsat 5, 1984–2011) to assess vegetation regrowth on 365 abandoned well pads located across the Colorado Plateau in Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico. We developed high-frequency time series of the Soil-Adjusted Total Vegetation Index (SATVI) for each well pad using the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform. BFAST time-series models were used to fit temporal trends, identifying when vegetation was cleared from the site and the magnitudes and rates of vegetation change after abandonment. The time series metrics are used to calculate the relative fractional vegetation cover (RFVC) of each pad, a measure of post-abandonment vegetation cover relative to pre-drilling condition. Mean and median RFVC were 36% (s.d. 33%) and 26%, respectively, five years after abandonment, with one third of well pads having RFVC greater than 50%. Statistical analyses suggest that much of the high vegetation cover is associated with weedy invasive annual species such as cheatgrass ( Bromus tectorum ) and Russian thistle ( Salsola spp.). Climate conditions and the year of abandonment also play a role, with increased cover in later years associated with a wetter period. Non-linear change at many pads suggests longer recovery times than would be estimated by linear extrapolation. New techniques implemented here address a complex response of cover change to soils, management, and climate over time, and can be extended to the operational monitoring of energy development across large areas.	time series	Eric K.

The use of multiple synchronized satellite sensors permits long-term monitoring with high spatial and temporal resolutions. However, differences in the spatial resolution of images collected by different sensors can introduce systematic biases, called scaling effects, into the biophysical retrievals. This study investigates the mechanism by which the scaling effects distort normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). This study focused on the monotonicity of the area-averaged NDVI as a function of the spatial resolution. A monotonic relationship was proved analytically by using the resolution transform model proposed in this study in combination with a two-endmember linear mixture model. The monotonicity allowed the inherent uncertainties introduced by the scaling effects (error bounds) to be explicitly determined by averaging the retrievals at the extrema of theresolutions. Error bounds could not be estimated, on the other hand, for non-monotonic relationships. Numerical simulations were conducted to demonstrate the monotonicity of the averaged NDVI along spatial resolution. This study provides a theoretical basis for the scaling effects and develops techniques for rectifying the scaling effects in biophysical retrievals to facilitate cross-sensor calibration for the long-term monitoring of vegetation dynamics.

The wetlands provide an important range of ecosystem services. Poyang Lake is subject to seasonal fluctuations, with changes in water levels apparent in seasonal, yearly and multi-year patterns. However, the lake is shallow, and the pronounced changes in water levels could lead to the large alterations in the wetlands landscape. Satellite radar altimetry has effectively been used for monitoring the water level change in recent years. This article focuses on the estimation of the fluctuation of Poyang Lake water level using level 2 geophysical data record (GDR) altimeter datasets from Cryosat-2/Siral in recent 6 years from 2010 to 2015. The altimeter datasets were extracted according the MODIS water product image. The abnormal water levels data were eliminated according to the Pauta criterion and Lomnaofski norm. The final water level results were interpolated using B-Spline to get the water level change trend and compared to the 6 hydrology stations' record. At last, the fluctuation trend in the past 6 years was analyzed using long-term trend estimation methods.	b-spline;cpu cache;ecosystem services;interpolation;quantum fluctuation;row (database)	Guozhuang Shen;Jingjuan Liao;Yun Zhao	2016	2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730775	market research;geomorphology;wetland;hydrology;altimeter;remote sensing	Robotics	83.45309516823826	-57.37268633746152	181094

These types of investigations have been limited by the inability of current viewshed routines to incorporate vegetation information. The following paper presents a new viewshed algorithm aimed at calculating the probability of locations being visible in the presence of vegetation. To this day little work has been done to address this limitation, a notable exception is Dean’s Permeability Index Model (1997). A review of Dean’s model is provided here in the light of the new proposed algorithm. The new algorithm is based on mathematical principles found in Beer-Lambert’s Attenuation Law, a physics law governing the attenuation of light through a medium. In addition to common viewshed parameters, the routine requires a 3D model of a tree/plant and a layer indicating the spatial distribution and density of vegetation on the landscape. The possibility of varying both, the spatial and density distribution of tree/plants, and the three-dimensional model representing vegetation makes the model to be well suited to investigate the impact that vegetation may have on visibility patterns.	3d modeling;algorithm	Marcos Llobera	2007	International Journal of Geographical Information Science	10.1080/13658810601169865	three-dimensional space;tree planting;viewshed analysis;geography;landscape archaeology;ecology;vegetation;cartography;remote sensing	Vision	83.56169273171857	-54.258240724640146	181444

Using the known radar calibration accuracy, radar sensing depth is defined to help understand the limit of radar backscatter sensitivity to subsurface soil conditions and used as a consistency check when determining ALT. Retrieved maps of soil dielectric constants and layer thicknesses show high spatial correlation with the vegetation type and organic layer thickness. It is shown that the retrieval accuracy for ALT is between 5 cm and 14 cm when the ALT is smaller than the sensing depth.	algorithm;l band;radar;thickness (graph theory)	Richard H.

Mathematically derived radiation on the surfaces was compared with grid-based model results. While both models showed good consistency with theoretical derivations, they both underestimated direct radiation at daily, most seasonal, and annual scales. KM performed better than SA at all the scales except at annual scale and in the summer. Horizon angle calculation and numerical integration are the common error sources in both models. Interpolation in horizontal angles and the use of a sky size parameter are the additional error sources in SA. Larger errors were found in SA when the sky size parameter and modeling time interval were not compatible. Overall, KM is a better choice for direct solar radiation modeling as it is more accurate and computationally efficient, easier to understand, and needs fewer parameters.

First, spatially distributed estimations of AGB were obtained from GLAS data. Second, the difference between the Vieilledentu0027s AGB map and GLAS derived AGB at each GLAS footprints location was calculated and a spatially distributed additional correction factors were obtained. Thanks to the spatial structure of these additional correction factors, an ordinary kriging interpolation was thus performed to provide a continuous correction factor map. Finally, the existing and the correction factor map were summed to improve the Vieilledentu0027s AGB map. Results showed that the integration of GLAS data overcome the saturation at high AGB of Vieilledentu0027s AGB map and allow AGB estimation until 650 t/ha (maximum AGB values from Vieilledent AGB map was 550 t/ha).	interpolation;kriging;the forest	Mohammad El-Hajj;Nicolas Baghdadi;Ibrahim Fayad;Ghislain Vieilledent;Jean-Stéphane Bailly;Ho Tong Minh Dinh	2017	2017 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8128323	remote sensing;optical imaging;interpolation;computer science;altimeter;lidar;kriging	Robotics	84.57018558760517	-60.491679982149805	182090

Spectral vegetation indices calculated from remote sensing data are widely used for LAI retrieval at large scales. The applicability of two vegetation indices, namely Simple Ratio (SR) and Reduced Simple Ration (RSR), for retrieving LAI at Maoershan mountain in Heilongjiang province of China was investigated through analyzing the correlations of SR and RSR calculated from Landsat-5 TM data acquired on 24 June, 2009 with LAI measured at 23 typical plots with Li-Cor LAI-2000 during 12 to 20 July, 2009. The fitted model with SR as the predator captured 54.7% of variations of LAI among these 23 plots while the variations of LAI explained by the fitted model with RSR as the predictor increased to 75.4%, indicating the better performance of RSR over SR in retrieving forest LAI in the study area owing to the ability of RSR to reduce the influence of soil background reflectance through the incorporation of the reflectance of shortwave infrared wavelength into SR. LAI derived from models based on SR and RSR was well correlated (R2=0.7219, N=180932). The mean of LAI estimated using the SR-based model was 0.37 larger than that estimated using the RSR-based model for the entire study area. LAI estimated using the former model was smaller than that estimated by the latter model when LAI estimated by the latter was larger than 5.6, indicating that RSR saturates slower than SR under the condition of high LAI. However, RSR is more sensitive to the influence of topography and shadows of clouds than SR.	climate model;ecology;kerrison predictor;li-chen wang;topography	Gaolong Zhu;Weimin Ju;Jing M.

A densely forested study site with maximum canopy heights reaching 70+ m in the central Sierra Nevada of California was identified based on the availability of suitable field data from within the general mission timeframe. Preliminary work has been conducted to compare C-band SRTM and TOPSAR digital elevation products with canopy height estimates obtained from ground measurements. Results indicate that SRTM data can be successfully correlated via linear regression modeling with ground-measured metrics of vegetation canopy height including median, mean, and maximum height. Maximum canopy height was predicted from SRTM data with an RMSE of 4.9 meters when a minimum of 50 SRTM pixels w as available for averaging This study confirms previous findings, which suggest that after averaging a minimum of 20 SRTM-NED difference pixels to reduce phase noise errors, stable estimates of interferometric mean scattering phase center height can be extracted.	holographic interferometry;motorola canopy;national elevation dataset;phase noise;pixel;shuttle radar topography mission	Wayne S.

09808f038cc061703b2222e14e1158f56623faf7	a novel statistical approach for ocean colour estimation of inherent optical properties and cyanobacteria abundance in optically complex waters	remote sensing reflectance;meris;phytoplankton pigments;cdm;olci;eof;cyanobacteria	Eutrophication is an increasing problem in coastal waters of the Baltic Sea. Moreover, algal blooms, which occur every summer in the Gulf of Gdansk can deleteriously impact human health, the aquatic environment, and economically important fisheries, tourism, and recreation industries. Traditional laboratory-based techniques for water monitoring are expensive and time consuming, which usually results in limited numbers of observations and discontinuity in space and time. The use of hyperspectral radiometers for coastal water observation provides the potential for more detailed remote optical monitoring. A statistical approach to develop local models for the estimation of optically significant components from in situ measured hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance in case 2 waters is presented in this study. The models, which are based on empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis and stepwise multilinear regression, allow for the estimation of parameters strongly correlated with phytoplankton (pigment concentration, absorption coefficient) and coloured detrital matter abundance (absorption coefficient) directly from reflectance spectra measured in situ. Chlorophyll a concentration, which is commonly used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass, was retrieved with low error (median percent difference, MPD = 17%, root mean square error RMSE = 0.14 in log10 space) and showed a high correlation with chlorophyll a measured in situ (R = 0.84). Furthermore, phycocyanin and phycoerythrin, both characteristic pigments for cyanobacteria species, were also retrieved reliably from reflectance with MPD = 23%, RMSE = 0.23, R2 = 0.77 and MPD = 24%, RMSE = 0.15, R2 = 0.74, respectively. The EOF technique proved to be accurate in the derivation of the absorption spectra of phytoplankton and coloured detrital matter (CDM), with R2 (λ) above 0.83 and RMSE around 0.10. The approach was also applied to satellite multispectral remote sensing reflectance data, thus allowing for improved temporal and spatial resolution compared with the in situ measurements. The EOF method tested on simulated Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) or Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) data resulted in RMSE = 0.16 for chl-a and RMSE = 0.29 for phycocyanin. The presented methods, applied to both in situ and satellite data, provide a powerful tool for coastal monitoring and management.

Hyperspectral reflectance was collected using an automatic system designed for high temporal frequency acquisitions for three consecutive years, including one (2011) characterized by a strong reduction of the carbon sequestration rate during the vegetative season.

MAGFLOW is intended for use in emergency response situations during an eruption to quickly forecast the lava flow path over some time interval from the immediate future to a long-time forecast. Major discrepancies between the observed and simulated paths occurred in the early phase of the 2006 eruption due to an underestimation of the initial flow rate, and at the time of the overlapping with the 2004–2005 lava flow. Very good representations of the areas likely to be inundated by lava flows were obtained when we adopt a time-varying effusion rate and include the 2004–2005 lava flow field in the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of topography. r 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

0338f9e2c74fd167b753e39a49aa48867a5f02cc	new crustal framework in the amazon craton based on geophysical data: evidences of deep east-west trending suture zones		The Tapajós mineral province (TMP), in the Brazilian Amazon Craton, comprises NW-SE Paleoproterozoic insular magmatic arcs accreted to the Carajás Archean Province (CAP). We present new geological and geophysical data pointing toward a different evolutionary model for the TMP. Results obtained from magnetic data indicate that NNW-SSE trending structures occur at shallow crustal levels. Furthermore, an E-W structural framework shows up at 15.4 km depth, in disagreement with the accreted island arc orientation. These E-W structures are associated with north-dipping blocks, reflecting ductile compressive tectonics, similar to the tectonic setting found in the CAP. We interpret these E-W structures of the TMP as the continuity westwards of similar structures from the CAP, under the Paleoproterozoic volcanic rocks of the Uatumã Supergroup. Based on this evidence, we propose that Paleoproterozoic arcs have been formed in an Archean active continental margin, instead of in island arcs. This novel tectonic setting for the TMP has significant implications for the tectonic evolution and the metallogenic potential of the southern portion of the Amazon craton, particularly for Paleoproterozoic magmatic-hydrothermal (epithermal and porphyry) precious and base metal systems.

The proposed methodology is based on the concept that the ratio between the surface scattering over the total amount of scattering (CTsurface /σsooil) is affected only by the vegetation and can be described as a function of the vegetation water content. The data set used in this study was collected at USDA's Optimizing Production Inputs for Economic and Environmental Enhancement (OPE3) experimental site in Beltsville, Maryland (USA) over a corn growth cycle in 2002 and includes C-band (4.75 GHz) HH- and VV-polarized observations acquired at incidence angles of 15, 35 and 55 degrees. During this period the corn crops reached peak biomass of 6.6 kg m−2 and a soil moisture range varying from 0.02 to 0.26 cm3cm−3. The results show that through application of the proposed vegetation correction methodology the soil moisture retrieval accuracy can be improved from 0.033 to 0.032 cm3cm−3, 0.049 to 0.033 cm3cm−3, and 0.079 to 0.047 cm3cm−3 at incidence angles of 15, 35 and 55 degrees, respectively.	backscatter (email);incidence matrix;l band;optimizing compiler;radar;verification and validation	Alicia T.

In this paper, we analyze the performance of this methodology over urban areas, which are characterized by a large number of different surface materials, a variability in the lowest layer of the atmospheric profiles, and a 3-D structure. These specificities induce errors in the LSE and LST retrieval, which should be quantified. With this aim, the efficiency of the TES algorithm over urban materials, the atmospheric correction, and the impact of the 3-D architecture of urban scenes are analyzed. The method is based on the use of a 3-D radiative transfer tool, TITAN, for modeling all of the radiative components of the signal registered by a sensor. From the sensor radiance, an atmosphere compensation process is applied, followed by a TES methodology that considers the observed scene to be a flat surface. Finally, the retrieved LSE and LST are compared with the original parameters. Results show the following: First, the TES algorithm used reproduces the LSE (LST) of urban materials within a root-mean-square error (rmse) of 0.017 (0.9 K). Second, 20% of uncertainty in the water vapor content of the total atmosphere introduces an rmse of 0.005 (0.4 K) for the LSE (LST) product. Third, in a standard case, the 3-D structure of an urban canyon leads to an rmse of 0.005 (0.2 K) for the LSE (LST) retrieval of the asphalt at the bottom of the scene.	algorithm;multispectral image;quantifier (logic);sensor;spatial variability;titan	Rosa Oltra-Carrió;Manuel Cubero-Castan;Xavier Briottet;José A.

The algorithm developed is based on inversion of a physical model of light scattering that requires no a priori knowledge of the land surface. The model is evaluated for a number of sites around the world to test its operation over a range of aerosol types and land covers including dark and bright surfaces. Validation is performed using Aerosol Robotic Network ground-based sun-photometer measurements and by intercomparison with independent estimates of AOD derived from spaceborne instruments including Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) aerosol products. Results show good agreement (Pearson's correlation coefficient r2=0.70 for all sites combined) between the AATSR-derived estimates of AOD and the sun-photometer measurements. There is also a high correlation (r2=0.84) between the AATSR- and MISR-derived AOD estimates, but the correlations of the AATSR-derived AOD with MODIS-derived AOD and TOMS aerosol index are lower. In addition, the ability of the sensor to discriminate between different aerosol types is evaluated. Moreover, the estimates of the aerosol properties are used for atmospheric correction of the top-of-atmosphere reflectance. The AATSR surface reflectances are compared with the MODIS bidirectional reflectance distribution function/Albedo and MISR surface products and are shown to correspond with root-mean-square errors of 0.03 and 0.06 or better, respectively. The retrieval method is applied on an image basis resulting in an image of surface reflectance and a separate map of AOD.

Radar signals acquired with different configurations (HH and VV polarizations, incidence angles of 26° and 36°) are statistically compared with ground measurements (soil moisture and roughness parameters). The radar measurements are found to be highly sensitive to the various soil parameters of interest. A linear relationship is determined for the radar signals as a function of volumetric soil moisture, and a logarithmic correlation is observed between the radar signals and three surface roughness parameters: the root mean square height (Hrms), the parameter Zs = Hrms2/l (where l is the correlation length) and the parameter Zg = Hrms × (Hrms/l)α (where α is the power of the surface height correlation function). The highest dynamic sensitivity is observed for Zg at high incidence angles. Finally, the performance of different physical and semi-empirical backscattering models (IEM, Baghdadi-calibrated IEM and Dubois models) is compared with SAR measurements. The results provide an indication of the limits of validity of the IEM and Dubois models, for various radar configurations and roughness conditions. Considerable improvements in OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2015, 7 748 the IEM model performance are observed using the Baghdadi-calibrated version of this model.	cosmo-rs;incidence matrix;integrated enterprise modeling;mean squared error;radar;semiconductor industry;verification and validation	Azza Gorrab;Mehrez Zribi;Nicolas Baghdadi;Bernard Mougenot;Zohra Lili-Chabaane	2015	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs70100747	meteorology;water content;hydrology;specific absorption rate;remote sensing	Mobile	84.19635622520916	-64.25633660020121	183673

Linear spectral unmixing was combined with liquid chromatography to quantitatively discriminate the areal biomass densities of the two populations. The grown biofilms exhibited highly heterogeneous distribution with patches of 1–2mm in size, although the conditions provided for growth, including substrate roughness, illumination and flow of the overlying water, were homogeneous. The biomass was initially dominated by cyanobacteria, which exhibited an exponential-like growth phase during days 2–7. Their population declined during days 9–17, which coincided with the growth phase of the diatom population. By allowing non-invasive and real-time measurements and data evaluation, the spectral imaging approach constitutes a useful tool for microbial ecologists.	population;real-time clock;stellar classification;substrate (electronics);time complexity	Lubos Polerecky;Judith M.

Two TES algorithms originally designed for long-wave infrared hyperspectral data, specifically, the iterative spectrally smooth (ISS) algorithm and the stepwise refining algorithm, are extended into MIR and renamed the extended iterative spectrally smooth (EISS) and extended stepwise refining algorithms (ESR), respectively. Numerical experiments are first conducted to evaluate their feasibility. The results of the numerical experiments indicate that the accuracy of the ESR algorithm is higher than that of the EISS algorithm. Moreover, the ESR algorithm is more robust than the EISS algorithm under sunlit conditions. Their accuracy is then validated with in situ measurements. Finally, the emissivity root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the EISS and ESR algorithms are compared with the data derived with the ISS algorithm using in situ measurements. Results show that the average emissivity RMSEs of 0.03 in 2000-2200 cm-1 and of 0.03-0.30 in 2400-3000 cm-1 for nighttime, and 0.02 in 2000-2200 cm-1 and 0.03 in 2500-3000 cm-1 for daytime, can be obtained from ground-based MIR hyperspectral data using the ESR algorithm.	algorithm;experiment;iterative method;mean squared error;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;numerical method;sas;stepwise regression	Jie Cheng;Shunlin Liang;Qinhuo Liu;Xiaowen Li	2011	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2010.2076818	hyperspectral imaging;accuracy and precision;optics;physics;statistics;remote sensing	Visualization	84.59160066036634	-63.82600557500365	183785

As such, forest canopy height is one of a nationwide suite of products generated by the LANDFIRE program. In the past, LANDFIRE has relied on a combination of field observations and Landsat imagery to develop existing vegetation structure products. The paucity of field data in the remote Alaskan forests has led to a very simple forest canopy height classification for the original LANDFIRE forest height map. To better meet the needs of data users and refine the map legend, LANDFIRE incorporated ICESat Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) data into the updating process when developing the LANDFIRE 2010 product. The high latitude of this region enabled dense coverage of discrete GLAS samples, from which forest height was calculated. Different methods for deriving height from the GLAS waveform data were applied, including an attempt to correct for slope. These methods were then evaluated and integrated into the final map according to predefined criteria. The resulting map of forest canopy height includes more height classes than the original map, thereby better depicting the heterogeneity of the landscape, and provides seamless data for fire behavior analysts and other users of LANDFIRE data.	airborne ranger;baseline (configuration management);behavior model;ecosystem;heightmap;landfire;motorola canopy;random forest;refinement (computing);seamless3d;simulation;spatial variability;the forest;topography;waveform	Birgit Peterson;Kurtis J.

But it is not adequate in many cases because spatial autocorrelation among variables may violate the underlying assumption that observations are independent. In this study, we compared the OLS regression model and the spatial autoregressive model for predicting corn yield in Iowa. The spatial autoregressive model indicated a significant improvement in model performance over OLS model. The spatial autoregressive model can provide better prediction than OLS model and is capable of adjusting the spatial autocorrelation, which is often ignored by the OLS model. The study demonstrated that NDVI and precipitation are the major predictors for forecasting corn yield in Iowa.	autocorrelation;autoregressive model;ordinary least squares;spatial analysis	Xiang Lin;Liping Lei;Dongmei Yan	2010	2010 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5652764	econometrics;machine learning;regression analysis;statistics	Vision	86.2743747674237	-60.53836440420625	184397

Almost all of the models based on the fitting parameters in Debye's equation were used to calculate the complex effective permittivity of a few aqueous electrolyte solutions, such as saline water and seawater. In this paper, we propose a new empirical formula to calculate the complex effective permittivity of a mixed aqueous electrolyte solution based on the measurement of complex impact factors for fundamental ions. The calculated complex effective permittivities of six mixed aqueous electrolyte solutions were compared with the measured results at 915 and 2450 MHz. The complex permittivity of saline water obtained by this model was compared with the published data as well. Good agreement can be observed.	microwave;salineos	Xiaoqing Yang;Kama Huang	2005	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2004.841252	seawater;hydrology;relative permittivity;electrolyte;physics	SE	84.41842995248541	-65.80558820330832	184436
508197e30959fd1ce51d320023adb467d6bb607e	estimating potential woody biomass in communal savanna woodlands from synthetic aperture radar (sar)	backscatter intensity;above ground biomass;article;alos palsar;quadpol;savanna woodlands;synthetic aperture radar	"""Recent developments in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technologies have shown their potential for assessing and quantifying above-ground biomass (AGB) at landscape levels in different biomes. This paper examines the application of full polarimetric data to retrieve information related to potential woody biomass in sparse communal savanna woodlands in southern Africa using the Advanced Land Observation Satellite’s Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS PALSAR). Woody vegetation classes were obtained from the unsupervised entropy/alpha Wishart classification of the full polarimetric ALOS/PALSAR data. A combination of Differential GPS and conventional surveying techniques was used for a field inventory survey to estimate plot-level biomass densities in Welverdiend communal woodlands of South Africa. Regression analysis was used to derive the logarithmic relationship between the sampled plot AGB densities and the mean backscatter intensity of the microwave signal, which is transmitted in the horizontal plane and received in the vertical plane (HV). The AGB density for each woody vegetation class is estimated by solving the logarithmic equation after extracting the mean HV backscatter intensity for the particular vegetation class. The potential woody biomass is estimated from the derived AGB densities and the areal extent of the respective woody vegetation classes. high cost of electricity has generally prevented a move away from dependency on bio-energy (Madubansi & Shackleton, 2007). At the same time, intensive harvesting practices and demands for arable farming land are contributing to the continued decrease in the availability of tree species preferred for fuelwood and/or charcoal. Indicators of energy poverty such as DOI: 10.4018/jagr.2012010105 54 International Journal of Applied Geospatial Research, 3(1), 53-62, January-March 2012 Copyright © 2012, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited. increased distance of preferred species from households are beginning to emerge in certain communal woodlands that are not subject to rigorous management regimes (Howells et al., 2003; Madubansi & Shackleton, 2007). This is resulting in the emergence of both microand macro-level woody biomass trading within and among villages, and from rural to urban areas respectively. In Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia, charcoal from communal woodlands is exported to urban centres for sale to low-income urban dwellers. However, there is a general paucity of quantitative data on available woody biomass resources to provide critical input into energy planning models at the landscape level in most rural economies (Mabowe, 2006). The objective of this paper is to investigate the potential of using the intensity of the backscatter signal of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar to quantify above ground biomass density and then map the spatial distribution of available above ground biomass resources in savanna woodlands. Utilisation of Woody Biomass Resources in Low-Income Communities Savanna woodlands provide a traditional source of woody biomass and other non-timber forestry products for a large percentage of households in both rural and urban low-income communities in southern Africa (Scholes & Archer, 1997; Twine, Moshe, Netshiluvhi, & Siphugu, 2003; Whitlow, 1979). The predominant source of bioenergy in most low-income rural and urban households is woody biomass in the form of charcoal and fuelwood (Banks, Griffin, Shackleton, Shackleton, & Mavrandonis, 1996; Wamukonya & Jerkins, 1995). In Mozambique, biomass (charcoal and firewood) provides up to 80% of energy consumption while 87% of rural households in Zambia use fuelwood for cooking (Brouwer & Falcão, 2004; Chidumayo, Masialeti, Ntalasha, & Kalumiana, 2002). Quantitative information about available biomass resources required to meet domestic energy demands is lacking in most developing economies. In addition, quantitative information on woody biomass resources is becoming critical for national inventories of woody biomass stocks for carbon sequestration and accounting purposes as well as for meeting the reporting requirements for international conventions and protocols such as the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change and the Reduction of Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD) initiatives (Gibbs, Brown, Niles, & Foley, 2007; Woodhouse, Cassells, Mitchard, & Tembo, 2009). Biomass Estimation in Savanna Woodlands Conventional field inventory and optical remote sensing approaches have been used in the past to estimate available above ground biomass (Chidumayo, 1997; Ellegård, Chidumayo, Malimbwi, Pereira, & Voss, 2002; Grundy, 1995). Field inventory measurements provide essential data for validating remotely sensed biomass estimates. However, such approaches are tedious and time-consuming. They are also constrained by accessibility problems, thus limiting the sampling approaches to areas where measuring equipment can be delivered (JICA, 2005; Mabowe, 2006; Netshiluvhi & Scholes, 2001). In savanna woodlands, allometric equations relating measurable tree parameters to above ground biomass quantities were established in previous studies (Netshiluvhi & Scholes, 2001). The total tree biomass (TB) is estimated using the equation: TB = 0.035 * DAH2.5 (1) where DAH is the diameter at ankle height. Recent developments in the airborne and spaceborne synthetic aperture radar technologies have shown great promise in obtaining standing woody biomass estimates in boreal, temperate and tropical forests (Mette, 2007; Papathanassiou, Lee, Kugler, & Hajnsek, 2008; Prakoso, 2006). Studies in these biomes have shown that the HV polarization of the L-band is sensitive to biomass densities up to 200 t 8 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the """"Add to Cart"""" button on the product's webpage: www.igi-global.com/article/estimating-potential-woodybiomass-communal/62047?camid=4v1 This title is available in InfoSci-Journals, InfoSci-Journal Disciplines Engineering, Natural, and Physical Science.

Since farmland is extending into the oasis–desert ecotone during oasis expansion, reclaimed farmland and control plots within the ecotone were investigated. The variations in soil moisture, soil nutrients and soil particle-size distribution of the two plots to a depth range of 0–100 cm were discussed. The soil moisture of each layer in the farmland to a depth of 0–100 cm differed significantly from that in the control plot; the former was generally higher than the latter in the same layer, particularly during the farming period (i.e. April–September). Agricultural soil moisture showed a time-variation rule from multimodal to unimodal with increased depth. Soil moisture of the control plot showed a generally monotonic increasing trend with increased depth; however, for the farmland plot, there was a unimodal increasing trend of initial increase and then a decrease with increased depth. Each layer of the farmland plot had a higher soil nutrient composite index than that of the control plot; however, this improving effect of farmland reclamation on soil nutrient conditions in the oasis–desert ecotone decreased with increased depth. The variation of soil particle-size showed a particular regularity under the influence of cultivation, i.e. silt and clay contents in farmland increased obviously and sand contents decreased * Corresponding author. e-mail: zengfj@ms.xjb.ac.cn	composite index (database);email;multimodal interaction;volcano plot (statistics)	Haifeng Li;Fanjiang Zeng;Dongwei Gui;Jiaqiang Lei	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-18333-1_38	environmental science;hydrology;soil science;agronomy;soil morphology;soil structure	AI	84.03480135445352	-56.24495311488087	184924

The 32-stream DISORT is used as the benchmark for assessments of the relative accuracy of the two methods investigated. With the comparisons for the accuracy of flux, the results of the two two-stream methods are almost the same in general and the absorbing media lead to larger errors of flux compared with that of the non-absorbing case.	approximation;benchmark (computing);semiconductor industry;streaming media	Weizhen Hou;Qiu Yin;Hua Xu;Li Li;Zhenghua Chen	2010	2010 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5652681	mathematical optimization;calculus;mathematics;optics;differential equation;physics;quantum mechanics;empirical modelling	Robotics	86.87480426633708	-63.92166847683629	185236
d6aa4a3a197345c50f74d7a47e4b31bf9f7cb398	burned area mapping of an escaped fire into tropical dry forest in western madagascar using multi-season landsat oli data		A human-induced fire cleared a large area of tropical dry forest near the Ankoatsifaka Research Station at Kirindy Mitea National Park in western Madagascar over several weeks in 2013. Fire is a major factor in the disturbance and loss of global tropical dry forests, yet remotely sensed mapping studies of fire-impacted tropical dry forests lag behind fire research of other forest types. Methods used to map burns in temperature forests may not perform as well in tropical dry forests where it can be difficult to distinguish between multiple-age burn scars and between bare soil and burns. In this study, the extent of forest lost to stand-replacing fire in Kirindy Mitea National Park was quantified using both spectral and textural information derived from multi-date satellite imagery. The total area of the burn was 18,034 ha. It is estimated that 6% (4761 ha) of the Park’s primary tropical dry forest burned over the period 23 June to 27 September. Half of the forest burned (2333 ha) was lost in the large conflagration adjacent to the Research Station. The best model for burn scar mapping in this highly-seasonal tropical forest and pastoral landscape included the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) and both uniand multi-temporal measures of greenness. Lessons for burn mapping of tropical dry forest are much the same as for tropical dry forest mapping—highly seasonal vegetation combined with a mixture of background spectral information make for a complicated analysis and may require multi-temporal imagery and site specific techniques.	esa;embedded system;random forest;scar (physics);the forest;tropical freeze;tropical cyclone forecast model;trusted data format	Anne C.

The surface area used is 8 by 8 square wavelengths. A total of close to 200 cases are computed by varying rms height, correlation length, and soil permittivity. We consider a 40° incidence angle. For each case, 15 realizations of rough surface profiles are generated, and 30 solutions of Maxwell equations are computed because of two polarizations. The method for solving the Maxwell equations is based on the Method of Moments (MoM) with Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) basis functions. The solutions are accelerated by the sparse matrix canonical grid method implemented on parallel computing. The rms height varies up to 0.126 wavelength. The results are compared with the Dubois formulation, Small Perturbation Method (SPM), Kirchhoff Approximation (KA), and Advanced Integral Equation Model (AIEM). The NMM3D results are also compared with VV and HH backscatter data of soil surfaces where ground truth rms heights and correlation lengths were both measured. Good agreement is found between the NMM3D results and experimental measurement data. Based on the computed cases, interpolation tables are derived that can be directly applied to L-band active and passive microwave remote sensing of soil moisture, such as for the upcoming Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) mission.	algorithm;approximation;basis function;boundary element method;cr rao advanced institute of mathematics, statistics and computer science;coefficient;coherence (physics);coherent;computer simulation;data cube;ground truth;incidence matrix;interpolation;kirchhoff's theorem;l band;maxwell (microarchitecture);microwave;numerical linear algebra;parallel computing;polarimetry;randomness;sparse matrix;super paper mario;table (information);time complexity;type signature;uv mapping;verification and validation	Shaowu Huang;Leung Tsang;Eni G.

abf9537aacb0af58f73265271271d7eb52375078	nationwide projection of rice yield using a crop model integrated with geostationary satellite imagery: a case study in south korea		The Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) of the Communication, Ocean, and Meteorological Satellite (COMS) increases the chance of acquiring images with greater clarity at eight times a day and is equipped with spectral bands suitable for monitoring crop yield with a moderate spatial resolution. The objectives of this study were to classify nationwide paddy fields and to project rice (Oryza sativa) yield and production using the grid-based GRAMI-rice model and GOCI satellite products over South Korea from 2011 to 2014. Solar insolation and temperatures were obtained from COMS and the Korea local analysis and prediction system for model inputs, respectively. The paddy fields and transplanting dates were estimated using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflectance and land cover products. The crop model was calibrated using observed yield data in 11 counties and was applied to 62 counties in South Korea. The overall accuracies of the detected paddy fields ranged from 89.5 to 90.2%. The simulated rice yields statistically agreed with observed yields, with root-mean-square errors of 0.219 to 0.451 ton ha-1 and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiencies of 0.241 to 0.733 in four years, respectively. According to paired t-tests (α = 0.05), the simulated and observed rice yields were not significantly different. These results demonstrate the possible development of a crop information delivery system that can classify land cover, simulate crop yield, and monitor regional crop production on a national scale.	calibration (statistics);geosynchronous satellite;image sensor;nash equilibrium;simulation	Seungtaek Jeong;Jonghan Ko;Jong-Min Yeom	2018	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs10101665	remote sensing;geology;satellite imagery;geostationary orbit;vegetation index	Robotics	84.99520137637997	-59.15266722111015	185752

The 2002 experiment focused on the exchange of remotely sensed and ground truth geographic information between analysts and field scientists. That experiment revealed several modifications that would enhance the performance and effectiveness of geographic information networks (GIN) for lunar and planetary exploration and emergency response. Phase 2 experiments conducted during June 2003 at the USGS Earth Resources and Observation Systems (EROS) Data Center's geologic imaging test site near Dinosaur National Monument in the NE Utah desert incorporated several of the lessons learned from the 2002 experiment and successfully added five major new components: (1) near-real-time hyperspectral and multispectral satellite image acquisition, (2) remotely controlled and coordinated mobile real-time ground sensor measurements during the imaging satellite overpass, (3) long-delay optimized Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol TCP/IP protocols to improve network performance over geosynchronous communications satellite circuits, (4) distributed, multinode parallel computing on NASA's Internet Power GRID (IPG), and (5) near-real-time validation of satellite imagery as part of a successful test of the NASA-USGS National Emergency Mapping Information System.	end-to-end principle;experiment;moon;planetary scanner;prototype	Richard A.

This relationship is based on the departure from simple Kolmogorov behavior of the turbulence structure of the IWV as the horizontal separation becomes a significant fraction of the scale height of the three dimensional (3D) turbulence. The relationship is demonstrated by comparisons between direct measurements of the vertical water vapor distribution, by radiosondes, and coincident estimates of the horizontal turbulence structure, using the TOPEX Microwave Radiometer (TMR). This provides a new method by which to resolve some of the vertical structure of lower tropospheric water vapor from space. The turbulence structure estimator is applied to a larger body of TMR data to produce a sequence of images describing the dynamics of water vapor scale height across the tropical Pacific Ocean. The cyclical evolution of a basin scale east/west ridge of water vapor with high scale height near 5 north latitude is detected which is consistent with other observations of the Madden and Julian Oscillation. The general technique presented here should be applicable to many other existing data sets which image the horizontal distribution of IWV, e.g., those of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program’s special sensor microwave/imagers.	microwave;triple modular redundancy;turbulence	Christopher S Ruf;Shawn E.

To assess the potential of remote sensing in estimating and mapping soil salinity in the El-Tina Plain, Sinai, Egypt, two predictive models were constructed based on the measured soil electrical conductivity (ECe) and laboratory soil reflectance spectra resampled to Landsat sensor’s resolution. The models used were partial least squares regression (PLSR) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). The results indicated that a good prediction of the soil salinity can be made based on the MARS model (R2 = 0.73, RMSE = 6.53, and ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) = 1.96), which performed better than the PLSR model (R2 = 0.70, RMSE = 6.95, and RPD = 1.82). The models were subsequently applied on a pixel-by-pixel basis to the reflectance values derived from two Landsat images (2006 and 2012) to generate quantitative maps of the soil salinity. The resulting maps were validated successfully for 37 and 26 sampling points for 2006 and 2012, respectively, with R2 = 0.72 and 0.74 for 2006 and 2012, respectively, for the MARS model, and R2 = 0.71 and 0.73 for 2006 and 2012, respectively, for the PLSR model. The results indicated that MARS is a more suitable technique than PLSR for the estimation and mapping of soil salinity, especially in areas with high levels of OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2014, 6 10814 salinity. The method developed in this paper can be used for other satellite data, like those provided by Landsat 8, and can be applied in other arid and semi-arid environments.	arid;elegant degradation;image resolution;map;multispectral image;multivariate adaptive regression splines;partial least squares regression;pixel;predictive modelling;sampling (signal processing);semiconductor industry;sensor;smoothing spline	Said Nawar;Henning Buddenbaum;Joachim Hill;Jacek Kozak	2014	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs61110813	soil salinity;mars exploration program;hydrology;soil science;physics;remote sensing	Robotics	83.88702030441513	-60.192373794394726	187690

The formulation envelops a wide range of land surface conditions based on three limiting cases defined in terms of end-members: smooth bare soil, rough bare soil, and a maximum vegetation covered soil. Parameterizations for these end-members are obtained using forward electromagnetic scattering models. Modulation due to soil surface roughness and overlying vegetation scattering effects between end-members are accounted using the radar vegetation index and the newly introduced radar roughness index. Hence, the retrieval algorithm developed here does not depend on ancillary vegetation or roughness information. The algorithm is tested with ground-based truck-mounted bare soil observations and observations from several airborne field campaigns that represent a wide range of surface conditions.	airborne ranger;algorithm;l band;modulation;radar	Parag S.

A unique dataset is used to study the sensitivity of laser interception profiles and laser-derived leaf area index (LAI) to assumptions about the surface structure and the measurement process. To simulate laser interception, one- and three-dimensional (3-D) vegetation structure models have been developed for maize and sunflower crops. Over sunflowers, a simple regression technique has been developed to extract laser-derived LAI, which accounts for measurement and model biases. Over maize, a 3-D structure/interception model that accounts for the effects of the laser inclination angle and detection threshold has enabled the fraction of radiation reaching the ground surface to be modelled to within 0.5% of the observed fraction. Good agreement was found between modelled and measured profiles of laser interception with a vertical resolution of 10 cm.	3d computer graphics;image resolution;motorola canopy;simulation	Caroline J.

It is meaningful and valuable to estimate the spatial distribution of precipitation. However, existing methods introduced for precipitation interpolation are not satisfactory. In this paper, geographic and topographic factors are taken into consideration and put into Cokriging method to interpolate the precipitation maps of annual precipitation in Poyang Lake Watershed of China. At the same time, IDW (Inverse distance weight) method, Ordinary Kriging method and Cokriging method considering elevation only has been used to interpolate the precipitation. Evaluating by MAE (mean absolute error), MRE (mean relative error), as well as RMSIE(Root mean squared interpolation error). The results indicate that Cokriging method considering geographic and topographic facotors is suoprior than IDW method and Cokriging method considering elevation only, and it has no obvious advantage compared with ordinary Kriging method.	approximation error;investigative data warehouse;kriging;map;mean squared error;multivariate interpolation;spatial reference system;topography;watershed (image processing)	Wenxia Gan;Xiaoling Chen;Xiaobing Cai;Jian Zhang;Lian Feng;Xiao Xie	2010	2010 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5650156	root mean square;interpolation;hydrology;correlation;china;mean absolute error;statistics;remote sensing	Robotics	85.68351649044985	-60.19396719605566	187838

However, many of the anomalies apparent in a magnetic image of a contaminated area are from metallic debris, shrapnel, and geological variations in ferromagnetic concentration. Observations are usually made in the far-field of the object so that, in most cases, we can only recover the dipole moment of a buried item. Due to self-demagnetization effects, the magnitude and direction of induced magnetism varies significantly with ordnance orientation. This results in an infinite number of ordnance-like objects that can reproduce a given dipole moment. To discriminate, we define a library of ordnance items expected to occur in the area and find how closely each recovered moment matches one of the UXOs in this library. We define the size of this mismatch as the remanent magnetization and produce a prioritized dig-list on the assumption that items with lower remanence are more likely to be UXO. Such a ranking scheme proves to be very effective when implemented at two sites in Montana. The analysis reveals that live-site and emplaced UXO have significantly different remanence and implies that previous tests of magnetic discrimination performance on seeded sites have been overly pessimistic.	ibm naval ordnance research calculator;remanence	Stephen D.

It is found that there's an insignificant linear relationship between urban index and phenological transition dates anomaly. An increase of 0.1 in urbanization index will cause about 4.1 days advancement of greenup onset and 1.3 days delay of dormancy onset.	anomaly detection;f-spot;onset (audio);ordinary least squares	Hong A Xu;Xi Yang;Qingxu Huang;Weihua Fang;Peijun Shi	2008	IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779471	meteorology;phenology;normalized difference vegetation index;climatology;physics;remote sensing	Embedded	83.30540277976874	-57.56782064002995	188976

The estimation of DTM accuracy dependent on the choice of the survey parameters is difficult due to the lack of reference surface. These authors have developed the methodology of simulation called virtual survey, which enables examining how various parameters of the echosounder, survey and DTM construction algorithms affect the errors of the created models. They are aimed at precise estimation of the model accuracy and the optimization of depth measurement work. The article includes the results of the examination of the effect of parameters determining the density of measurement points on the accuracy of the obtained GRID model. It has been proved that a significant reduction of recorded data density leads to only a slight increase in the modeling error, which makes the bathymetric survey much more cost-effective.	digital elevation model	Wojciech Maleika;Michal Palczynski;Dariusz Frejlichowski	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-28493-9_48	digital elevation model;bathymetry	Mobile	86.15428970291086	-60.47690304106674	189735

The simulation results are assessed by computing Fractional Speed Up Ratio (FSUR) along longitudinal lines at different elevations. Such information is useful for evaluating wind loads on long span structures and micro-siting of wind turbines on complex terrain. Simulations are conducted on both idealized and real topographic features in both 2D and 3D domain. The turbulence structure behind hills is examined using several turbulence models such as the mixing-length, standard k-@?, RNG k-@?, realizable k-@? and Smagorinsky LES models. All turbulence models predicted FSUR values on upstream side of hills adequately; however, the performance of simple turbulence models, such as mixing length, is found to be insufficient for characterizing wakes behind hills. RANS turbulence models gave results close to one another; however, those models that incorporate modifications to account for adverse pressure gradient conditions performed better at wakes behind hills. LES conducted at full scale dimensions, and using wall functions, failed to give results that are comparable to the other turbulence models. Re-conducting the simulations at model scale dimensions, hence at relatively small Reynolds number, and without using wall functions gave results that are comparable to those found in the literature. Therefore, use of wall functions can degrade quality of results in LES of high Reynolds number flows of practical interest.	simulation;turbulence modeling	Daniel S. Abdi;Girma T.

Increasing climate temperatures in the arctic region have given rise to permafrost thaw, exposing once stable organic carbon to decomposition, and potentially altering the global carbon budget. In this study, we present a secondary data analysis of high frequency net ecosystem (CO2) exchange measurements made using a quantum cascade laser spectrometer (Aerodyne Research Institute) connected to a nine member autochamber system positioned in the three dominant vegetation communities at Stordalen Mire in Northern Sweden (68° 21'N, 18° 49'E). Over DOY 121 - 260 during the year 2013, the magnitude of net ecosystem (CO2) exchanged followed the moisture gradient with increasing CO2 uptake from the dry Palsa site (- 0.3 ± 1.6 mg C m-2 h-1), to the wet intermediate melt feature with Sphagnum spp. (- 22.1 ± 0.9 mg C m-2 h-1), to the fully wet Eriophorum spp. site (- 49.9 ± 4.2 mg C m-2 h-1), with highest uptake occurring in the fully thawed Eriophorum/ Sphagnum (Ch. 9) collar (- 87.2 ± 6.0 mg C m-2 h-1) (overall mean ±1 SE, n = 1267, 2334, 1211, 772). All mean fluxes were statistically different from each other (p <; 0.0001). At all sites, PAR was the best environmental predictor of NEE. Although increased warming has resulted in permafrost thaw, any possible loss of old carbon in the form of CO2 from thawing or thawed sites was more than offset by a greater net uptake of CO2 occurring in the wetter sites.	carbon cycle;ecosystem;gradient;kerrison predictor	Ryan D.

The effect of the large-scale roughness component is accounted for by a numerical solution of the integral equation for surface field obtained in the forward-scattering approximation. The presence of the small-scale roughness responsible for backscattering is treated by the smallperturbation theory. The numerical simulations accomplished support the viewpoint that the significant difference between experimentally observed and numerically calculated values of polarization ratio for low grazing angles is most likely due to inadequate modeling of surface roughness. It is demonstrated that adding a few relatively minor steep-wave-like features to the surface with the standard Pierson–Moskowitz spectrum will change the average polarization ratio dramatically, bringing its theoretical values from about −20 dB to experimentally observed values of a few negative dB. Half of this increase is due to steepening of the front faces of the undulating waves. However, the other 10 dB of increase is due to diffraction effects, which enhance the scattering coefficient for the HH-polarization on the front faces of the steep waves.	approximation;coefficient;experiment;mathematical model;numerical analysis;numerical partial differential equations;paul moskowitz;polarization (waves);simulation	Alexander G.

7d284bfec2df508382e32a54d38a89f31dd6e9a9	the mapping of simulated climate-dependent building innovations		Performances of building energy innovations are most of the time dependent on the external climate conditions. This means a high performance of a specific innovation in a certain part of Europe, does not imply the same performances in other regions. The mapping of simulated building performances at the EU scale could prevent the waste of potential good ideas by identifying the best region for a specific innovation. This paper presents a methodology for obtaining maps of performances of building innovations that are virtually spread over whole Europe. It is concluded that these maps are useful for finding regions at the EU where innovations have the highest expected performances.	audio feedback;benchmark (computing);climate model;coefficient;computer cooling;matlab;map;performance;radiant ai;simulation	A.

Time series of selected rainfall indices from the joint CCl/CLIVAR/JCOMM Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices are computed at yearly and seasonal scales. Rainfall climatology and spatial patterns of variability are extracted via the analysis of the total rainfall amount (PRCPTOT), the simple daily intensity (SDII), the number of precipitating days (R1), the number of consecutive dry and wet days (CDD and CWD), and the number of very heavy precipitating days (R20). Our results show that the spatial patterns of such trends depend on the selected rainfall product, as much as on the geographic areas characterized by statistically significant trends for a specific rainfall index. Nevertheless, indications of rainfall trends were extracted especially at the seasonal scale. Increasing trends were identified for the October–November–December PRCPTOT, R1, and SDII indices over eastern EA, with the exception of Kenya. In March–April–May, rainfall is decreasing over a large part of EA, as demonstrated by negative trends of PRCPTOT, R1, CWD, and R20, even if a complete convergence of all satellite products is not achieved.	cdd;cartesian perceptual compression;heart rate variability;image resolution;spatial variability;time series	Elsa Cattani;Andrés Merino;José A.

In recent decades, droughts are becoming more frequent and intense implying an increase of forest decline episodes and forest fires. In this context, global and frequent soil moisture observations from the ESA's SMOS mission could be useful in controlling forest exposure to decline and fires. In this paper, SMOS observations and several climate variables are analyzed together with decline and fire inventories, to study the effect of soil moisture on forest decline during an important drought on summer 2012, and on forest fires in the period 2010-2013. Results show that SMOS-derived soil moisture is a complementary variable in forest decline models. Some of the studied tree species exhibit high probability of decline occurrence under dry conditions.

In current study, a process-based model named ETMonitor was developed to estimate the ET, based mainly on the biophysical and hydrological parameters retrieved from satellite earth observations. And global daily ET from 2008 to 2012 with a spatial resolution of 1 km was estimated based on multi-source earth observations datasets. The estimated ET agreed well with the in situ observations at field scale, with R2 = 0.74, Bias = -0.05 mm d-1, RMSE = 0.87 mm d-1. The spatial patterns of estimated ET also agree well with the current available global ET products such as MOD16 and GLEAM. The ET products provide critical information on global terrestrial water and energy cycles and environmental change.	arid;electron tomography;multi-source;semiconductor industry;terrestrial television	Chaolei Zheng;Li Jia;Guangcheng Hu;Jing Lu;Kun Wang;Zhansheng Li	2016	2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729049	estimation;immune system;image resolution;hydrology;soil science;earth;physics;statistics;remote sensing	Robotics	84.4946264019597	-60.94356940378016	191135

Therefore, it is possible to create High Resolution (HR) Digital Elevation Models (DEM) incorporating thin above ground elements influencing overland flow paths. Even though this category of big data has a high level of accuracy, there are still errors in measurements and hypothesis under DEM elaboration. Moreover, operators look for optimizing spatial discretization resolution in order to improve flood models computation time. Errors in measurement, errors in DEM generation, and operator choices for inclusion of this data within 2D hydraulic model, might influence results of flood models simulations. These errors and hypothesis may influence significantly flood modelling results variability. The purpose of this study is to investigate uncertainties related to (i) the own error of high resolution topographic data, and (ii) the modeller choices when including topographic data in hydraulic codes. The aim is to perform a Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) which goes through a MonteCarlo uncertainty propagation, to quantify impact of uncertainties, followed by a Sobol’ indices computation, to rank influence of identified parameters on result variability. A process using a coupling of an environment for parametric computation (Prométhée) and a code relying on 2D shallow water equations (FullSWOF 2D) has been developed (P-FS tool). The study has been performed over the lower part of the Var river valley using the estimated hydrograph of 1994 flood event. HR topographic data has been made available for the study area, which is 17.5 km, by Nice municipality. Three uncertain parameters were studied: the measurement error (var. E), the level of details of above-ground element representation in DEM (buildings, sidewalks, etc.) (var. S), and the spatial discretization resolution (grid cell size for regular mesh) (var. R). Parameter var. E follows a probability density function, whereas parameters var. S and var. R. are discrete operator choices. Combining these parameters, a database of 2, 000 simulations has been produced using P-FS tool implemented on a high performance computing structure.

We then tested whether seasonality estimated using the coefficient of variation of EVI was related to intensity of home range overlap. We also tested whether the intensity of home range overlap was related to distance from water, particularly during the dry season. We determined the intensity of home range overlap using the Utilization Distribution Overlap Index. We then modelled the intensity of home range overlap as a function of seasonality. Results show that intensity of home range overlap varied with seasonality in a non-linear U-shaped manner. In addition, results showed that at both high and low levels of seasonality, intensity of home range overlap was high while it was low at moderate levels of seasonality. Results also indicated that the intensity of home range overlap increased with distance from water during the dry period. The U-shaped relationship obtained in this study conform to the behavioural theory that predicts similar relationships between food abundance and territoriality, indicating that remotely sensed productivity is an ecologically meaningful measure of food abundance. This further amplifies the utility of the combination of GPS animal movement data and remotely sensed data in spatial ecology.	semiconductor industry	Fadzai M.

LOC provides the guidance in the horizontal position of an aircraft for the runway center line. The radiation from LOC antenna generates the composite field which is amplitude modulated by a 90 Hz and a 150 Hz tone. The performance of the LOC is given by the difference in the depth of the modulation (DDM) along the runway centerline. However, their signals are influenced by the scattered waves if the LOC antenna is located over the complicated ground condition. In this paper, we consider the influences of the scattered waves caused by the complicated terrain, from a view point of the numerical simulation by the ray-tracing method (RTM). Firstly the basic principle of the LOC is introduced. Next, the simplified RTM is discussed. Finally, we show some numerical examples for field intensity distribution and DDM. We discuss how the scattered waves influence the performance of LOC.

In this paper, we study the range and incidence angle effects on the intensity measurements and search for practical correction methods for different TLS instruments and targets. We find that the range (distance) effect is strongly dominated by instrumental factors, whereas the incidence angle effect is mainly caused by the target surface properties. Correction for both effects is possible, but more studies are needed for physical interpretation and more efficient use of intensity data for target characterization.	incidence matrix;terrestrial television;topography	Sanna Kaasalainen;Anttoni Jaakkola;Mikko Kaasalainen;Anssi Krooks;Antero Kukko	2011	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs3102207	intensity;optics;physics;angle of incidence;remote sensing	HCI	84.42332183516875	-64.10966479034171	192266

Cephalopod  sheries show marked inter-annual  uctuations unrelated to  shery landings and eŒort. Their population dynamics, particularly recruitment, are thought to be strongly susceptible to changes in environmental conditions. This arises in part from the short life cycle, resulting in poor buŒering of the population against changing conditions. These characteristics make traditional approaches to stock assessment and  shery management inappropriate. GIS oŒers a tool to improve understanding of spatio-temporal trends in abundance and facilitate rational management. A cephalopod  shery geographical information system for Northeast Atlantic waters (CFGIS-NEA) was developed. The system covers the area from 28.0ß W to 11.0 ß E, and 34.5 ß N to 65.5 ß N. It was designed for investigating cephalopod resource dynamics in relation to environmental variation. It is based on Unix Arc/Info, and PC ArcView, combined with the statistical software package S-PLUS and supported by a database in Microsoft Access. Environmental data (e.g. sea surface temperature and salinity, sea bottom temperature and salinity, and bathymetric data), cephalopod  shery, survey and biological data, from a variety of sources, were integrated in the GIS as coverages, grids, shape les, and tables. Special functions were developed for data integration, data conversion, query, visualisation, analysis and management. User-friendly interfaces were developed allowing relatively inexperienced users to operate the system. The spatial and temporal distribution patterns of cephalopod abundance by species, the spatial and temporal relationships between cephalopod abundance and environmental factors, and the spatial and temporal patterns of cephalopod  shing activity were analysed using a combination of visual (qualitative) and quantitative methods. Predictive empirical models, such as GAMs (generalized additive models), were developed for modelling cephalopod abundance using environmental variables.	arcinfo;arcview;bathymetry;color;enterprise life cycle;experience;gams;generalized additive model;geographic information system;list of statistical packages;microsoft access;oracle database;population dynamics;s-plus;scientific visualization;unix;usability	Graham J.

Quickly and accurately monitoring the status of vegetation growth and evolution has certain reference meaning in the socio-economic constructions and ecological studies. Remote sensing is an effective measure to monitor vegetation at regional and global scales. Taking the sensitive area to the global climate and environmental change, Lake Baikal and Siberia, the present study aims to explore the response of vegetation to the climate changes. The data of monthly NDVI / MODIS data, with a spatial resolution of 0.05 deg from 2003 to 2008 were used in this study. The results showed that the yearly variations of NDVI were well corresponding to the growth and decline of vegetation and seasonal changes, which showed obvious phenological phenomena. Correlation analysis presented that with increasing in temperature and precipitation, NDVI increased gradually and vegetations grew well. Moreover, the influence of the precipitation on vegetation was slightly lower than that of the temperature. From 2003 to 2008, the change of NDVI showed a gradual upward trend except the low value in 2006. In the growing seasons, NDVI from 2003 to 2008, roughly showed an upward trend; in non-growing seasons, NDVI showed a roughly linear downward trend. The spatial distribution of NDVI in the west Lake Baikal was relatively lower, and the highest value appeared in the north, followed by the south and east. Different vegetation types emerged in the different NDVI values. NDVI of the tundra was the lowest, followed by scrub and agricultural land, the NDVI values of the wetlands and grassland were relatively high, and the NDVI value of forest lands was the maximum.	data scrubbing;ecosystem;terrestrial television	Jiaxin Jin;Hong Jiang;Yueqi Wang;Xiuying Zhang	2010	2010 18th International Conference on Geoinformatics	10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2010.5567661	environmental science;enhanced vegetation index;climatology;soil science;remote sensing	HCI	83.70806848211545	-56.85483337990631	192402
11d93c842ebefd805940a269ab5b30b62220d9e4	vegetation dynamics in the upper guinean forest region of west africa from 2001 to 2015	upper guinea forest;tropical forest;savanna;tasseled cap transformation;mann kendall;nbar;vegetation change;modis;africa	The Upper Guinea Forest (UGF) region of West Africa is one of the most climatically marginal and human-impacted tropical forest regions in the world. Research on the patterns and drivers of vegetation change is critical for developing strategies to sustain ecosystem services in the region and to understand how climate and land use change will affect other tropical forests around the globe. We compared six spectral indices calculated from the 2001–2015 MODIS optical-infrared reflectance data with manually-interpreted measurements of woody vegetation cover from high resolution imagery. The tasseled cap wetness (TCW) index was found to have the strongest association with woody vegetation cover, whereas greenness indices, such as the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), had relatively weak associations with woody cover. Trends in woody vegetation cover measured with the TCW index were analyzed using Mann–Kendall statistics and were contrasted with trends in vegetation greenness measured with EVI. In the drier West Sudanian Savanna and Guinean Forest-Savanna Mosaic ecoregions, EVI trends were primarily positive, and TCW trends were primarily negative, suggesting that woody vegetation cover was decreasing, while herbaceous vegetation cover is increasing. In the wettest tropical forests in the Western Guinean Lowland Forest ecoregion, declining trends in both TCW and EVI were indicative of widespread forest degradation resulting from human activities. Across all ecoregions, declines in woody cover were less prevalent in protected areas where human activities were restricted. Multiple lines of evidence suggested that human land use and resource extraction, rather than climate trends or short-term climatic anomalies, were the predominant drivers of recent vegetation change in the UGF region of West Africa.	cap computer;coefficient;ecosystem services;elegant degradation;image resolution;marginal model;pixel;vigor (software)	Zhifeng Liu;Michael C.

A new interpolation formula has been obtained using finite element method giving due consideration to missing observations in any raingauge station data time series. An important feature of this method is that there is no need to redesign the triangulation of the given region in case: (a) if number of observations increase in this region, or (b) if observations are missing in the data time series of any station chosen as a node in triangulating this region. Their contribution to the areal precipitation has been incorporated in a mathematically consistent manner. As an application of this method, daily rainfall time series of 119 raingauge stations for four successive summer monsoons (1986-1989) are utilized to obtain the daily precipitation values on a spatial grid with 1.8° × 3.6° (lat/lon) resolution. From the daily gridded rainfall, pentads (5-day averages) of rainfall are obtained. These pentads are arranged in a time series and a principal component analysis (PCA) is performed. The first four principal components explain 63% of the total variance of rainfall over India. The oscillations depicted by these modes agree well with earlier studies. It is concluded that a few dominant PCs of rainfall calculated from pentads (as compared to seasonal and annual average rainfall) explain a larger part of the total variance of rainfall. This method is essentially related to large-scale rainfall depiction. It could, therefore, easily be used to produce global gridded precipitation fields from raingauge measurements. The spatial interpolation code is available on request from the first author.	regular grid	O. P. Sharma;H. C. Upadhyaya;A. Harzallah;R. Sadourny	2006	J. Comput.

It has been shown in numerous studies that microwave remote sensing can provide spatially distributed patterns of surface soil moisture. In order to use remote-sensing-derived soil moisture information for practical applications as, for example, flood forecasting and water balance modeling in mesoscale areas, frequent large-area coverage is a prerequisite. New sensor generations such as ENVISAT Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) or RADARSAT allow for image acquisitions in different imaging modes and geometries. Imaging modes with the capability of large-area coverage, such as the Wide Swath Mode of ENVISAT ASAR, are of special interest for practical applications in this context. This paper presents a semiempirical soil moisture inversion scheme for ENVISAT ASAR data. Different land cover types as well as mixed-image pixels are taken into account in the soil moisture retrieval process. The inversion results are validated against in situ measurements, and a sensitivity analysis of the model is conducted.	algorithm;aperture (software);cross-validation (statistics);microwave;pixel;semi-empirical quantum chemistry method;time series	Alexander Loew;Ralf Ludwig;Wolfram Mauser	2006	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2005.863858	meteorology;hydrology;inverse problem;interface;physics;remote sensing	Visualization	83.60095921293374	-63.263154395128346	192554

Tests were conducted using a commercially available, nacelle-mounted continuous-wave lidar system from ZephIR Lidar for the implementation of a lidar-based collective pitch feed-forward controller. During the campaign, the data processing of the lidar system was optimized for higher availability. Furthermore, the optimal scan distance was investigated for the CART3 by means of a spectra-based analytical model and found to match the lidar's capabilities well. Throughout the campaign the predicted correlation between the lidar measurements and the turbine's reaction was confirmed from the measured data. Additionally, the baseline feedback controller's gains were tuned based on a simulation study that included the lidar system to achieve further load reductions. This led to some promising first results, which are presented at the end of this paper.	algorithm;baseline (configuration management);control theory;feed forward (control);microsoft outlook for mac;simulation	Florian Haizmann;David Schlipf;Steffen Raach;Andrew K.

Information on GVF is needed to estimate the surface energy balance in numerical weather prediction (NWP) and climate models. For the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R Series (GOES-R) Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) algorithm development, a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) based linear mixture algorithm has been chosen to convert NDVI into GVF. The GVF algorithm has been developed and tested using a proxy dataset from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) sensor onboard the European Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) geostationary satellite. Studies of SEVIRI data have shown that NDVI strongly depends upon the viewing and illumination geometry of observations, especially over dense vegetation. If not corrected, this angular anisotropy of NDVI causes substantial spurious diurnal variations in the derived GVF. An empirical kernel-driven model to correct NDVI for angular anisotropy has been developed and implemented in the GVF algorithm. Its kernel weights for the GVF algorithm were also determined empirically from the SEVIRI clear-sky data. The preliminary validation estimates show that the model's performance is good.	algorithm;angularjs;application binary interface;climate model;geosynchronous satellite;image sensor;kernel (operating system);numerical analysis;numerical weather prediction;taylor–green vortex	Yuhong Tian;Peter Romanov;Yunyue Yu;Hui Xu;Dan Tarpley	2010	2010 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5651925	meteorology;enhanced vegetation index;normalized difference vegetation index;geology;hydrology;geostationary operational environmental satellite;numerical weather prediction;diurnal temperature variation;physics;vegetation;remote sensing;climate model	Robotics	84.24902617225037	-60.619101228831006	192916

Our empirical data focused at the landscape scale on a test site in northern Michigan, using radar and Landsat imagery and bird-presence data by species. We tested the contributions of multi-dimensional forest and landscape structure variables using GARP (Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Production), a representative modeling methodology used in biodiversity informatics. For our multidimensional variables, radar data were processed to derive forest biomass maps and these data were used with a Landsat-derived vegetation type classification and spatial neighborhood analyses. We collected field data on bird species presence and habitat for northern forest birds known to have a range of vegetation habitat requirements. We modeled and tested the relationships between bird presence and 1) vegetation type, 2) vegetation type and spatial neighborhood descriptions, 3) vegetation type and biomass, and 4) all variables together, using GARP, for three bird species. Modeled results showed that inclusion of biomass or neighborhoods improved the accuracy of bird habitat prediction over vegetation type alone, and that the inclusion of neighborhoods and biomass together generally produced the greatest improvement. Themaps andmodel rules resulting from the multiple factormodels were interpreted to bemore precise depictions of a particular species habitat when compared with themodels that used vegetation type only. We suggest that for bird species whose niche requirements include forest and landscape structure, inclusion of multi-dimensional information may be advantageous in habitat modeling at the landscape level. Further research should focus on testing additional variables and species, on further integration of newer radar and lidar remote sensing capabilities withmulti-spectral sensors for quantifying forest and landscape multi-dimensional structure, and incorporating these in biodiversity informatics modeling. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Some weli known specific climatic air poilution effects were studied and explained. Calculations were made ofthe S02 poilution ofthe Balkan peninsula from both Greek and Buigarian sources for 1995 and the country to country pollution budget diagrams were build. Days with extreme mean concentration for Buigaria and Northern Greece were picked out and some further specification of the contribution of the different sources in both the countries to these cases ofextreme po!Iution was made. Some preliminary studies of possibie mesoscaie effects on the pollution exchange between Bulgaria and northern Greece were carried out. A three-layer pollution transport model with more complex chemistry block was introduced and some preliminary simulations of Sulfur and Nitrogen compounds transport were performed. Ob jectives The present work aims at a detaiied study and explanation of the pollution transport in the air basin over South-western Bulgaria and Northern Greece and assessment of the air pollution exchange between Bulgaria and Greeee. Research methods and techniques The air pollution studies and the following assessments were based on reliable and representative data: BREWER and DOAS air pollution data from Thessaioniki since 1982; detailed synoptic information for the Balkan peninsula since 1994; detailed emission inventory, based on the CORlNAIR methodology since 1990; information from ground-based air pollution measuring stations Extensive computer simulations were carried out and the conclusions were made on the basis of joint anaiysis of data and simuiation results. Main results A specific climatic effect was registered in the city of Thessaloniki by analysis of the time series obtained by the 1 5 year Brewer spectrophotometer measurements of the columnar S02 although the maximum concentrations of columnar S02 originate form local sources in the winter, sign[ficant columnar S02 amounts are aiso seen in the summer, when there are no locai sulfur sources. On a few occasions however, as high as 5-7 m-atm-cm of columnar S02 have been measured both in winter and summer period.

The algorithm was based on kernel driven BRDF models, the 69 sets of field observations were classified into four classes according to AFX (Anisotropic Flat Index) which can indicate basic dome-bowl anisotropic reflectance patterns of terrestrial surface, and then the archetypal BRDF shapes database was created. In the inversion of surface albedo, we fit the observations using the four archetypal BRDF shapes respectively to select the shape that has least fitting error as the underlying surface anisotropy prior knowledge. The archetypal BRDF shapes do not depend on land cover. An albedo datasets for air-borne WIDAS is produced with this scheme. At last, we obtained the shortwave spectral albedo of WIDAS in the Yingke station in WATER Campaign. Comparison of the albedo with field observations shows that the absolute error is less than 0.05. This study will provide a possible method for space-borne albedo retrieval which lacks sufficient multi-angular observations.	afx windows rootkit 2003;algorithm;angularjs;approximation error;bidirectional reflectance distribution function;gene expression programming;lambertian reflectance;terrestrial television	Hu Zhang;Ziti Jiao;Qiang Liu;Xingying Huang;Xiaowen Li	2012	2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6351737	meteorology;bidirectional reflectance distribution function;reflectivity;optics;physics;albedo;remote sensing	Vision	85.20704300189131	-61.45269086683625	193373

As the maximum discharge capacity depends on the hydraulic resistance of vegetation, a key biophysical parameter for floodplain monitoring is vegetation biomass. The objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of mapping above- ground biomass and vegetation structure of heterogeneous canopies in river floodplains using imaging spectroscopy. We establish linear predictive models between vegetation indices derived from airborne imaging spectrometer (HyMap) data and field measurements of biomass (n = 21) for a floodplain in the Netherlands. Results for broad-band and narrow-band derived Vis (e.g., NDVI, SAVI, WDVI and RSR) and a multivariate approach using PLS were compared using a cross-validation procedure to assess the prediction power of the regression models. Results showed that regression models could be improved when differences in vegetation structure were taken into account. Vegetation biomass maps for the floodplain were prepared in two steps. First a classification of plant functional types (PFT) was made using mixture tuned match filtering (MTMF). In a second step, the best regression models were used to map the spatial distribution of vegetation biomass. The results demonstrate the necessity to use a PFT based approach for biomass assessment, improving the quality of the prediction significantly over conventional approaches.	airborne ranger;cross-validation (statistics);discharger;ecosystem model;hymap;map;predictive modelling;succession;visual instruction set	Lammert Kooistra;Maria Dolores Suárez Barranco;Han van Dobben;Michael E.

However, our understanding of cattle behavior and resource selection on the extensive African rangelands suffers from a lack of quantitative, continuous and inter-seasonal monitoring of cattle movement. Based on integration of GPS-tracking and field observations, this study links cattle behavioral types with statistical parameters of movement, analyzes spatiotemporal dynamics of behavior and predicts resource selection patterns in Borana Zone of southern Ethiopia. We find that different cattle behavioral types were associated with distinct ranges of movement velocity. Distribution of identified cattle behavior varied substantially within the day and along the distance gradient from camp locations. Vegetation greenness, topography, study site, herding strategy and season were dominant factors influencing foraging areas selection by cattle.

For long-term environmental studies, multisensor NDVI discrepancies should be initially corrected via intersensor NDVI calibration. This paper proposes a generalized model and its simplified form for the calibration by incorporating sensor-, atmosphere-, and observational geometry-related parameters into an analytical function. The models are first validated using the tandem Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper and Earth Observing One (EO-1) Advanced Land Imager (ALI) NDVIs and then used to evaluate current intercalibration methods. The results show that surface reflectance is the most critical factor for linear intercalibrations followed by water vapor. While other atmospheric parameters as well as solar zenith angle have minor effects on linear intercalibrations. The strong nonlinear relationships between the spectral band adjustment factors and NDVI may explain why quadratic functions are used for NDVI intercalibration. Although quadratic intercalibrations are generally more accurate than linear intercalibrations, they may still perform poorly when water vapor exhibits significant spatial variations. In addition, the uncertainties associated with current NDVI intercalibrations are discussed based on the proposed models. This paper furthers the understanding of multisensor NDVI intercalibration and provides insight into intercalibration of other remote sensing indices.	ali corporation;ahead-of-time compilation;apple a5;approximation algorithm;backup;coefficient;exptime;nonlinear system;optical disc authoring;quadratic function;sensor	Xingwang Fan;Yuanbo Liu	2017	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2016.2635802	meteorology;database index;atmospheric model;calibration;hydrology;earth;physics;satellite;remote sensing	Visualization	85.33610951991264	-61.60336336722426	194926

Here, we quantified correspondence between remotely sensed land cover and a model-derived projection of European land use to build a calibration and evaluation framework for land use projection models. For an eight-year period (2006–2013), we compared simulated land uses from a model (CRAFTY-EU), defined as agent functional types, against remotely sensed MODIS land cover. Information between two datasets and spatial complexity are calculated, which allowed the evaluation of the CRAFTY model and calibration of the model parameters. The computational cost was high. Thus more efficient searching algorithms are called for. The evaluation framework holds promise for better calibration of land use decision models to increase model usability and improve the value of future land cover projections.	algorithmic efficiency;computation;search algorithm;usability	Bumsuk Seo;Calum Brown;Mark Rounsevell	2018	IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8518023	calibration;remote sensing;land use;land cover;computer science;usability;decision model;search algorithm	Vision	85.25747824009417	-59.643455251237455	194965

Many authors have demonstrated the role of remote sensing in the assessment of the equivalent water thickness (EWT), which is defined as the weight of liquid water per unit of leaf surface. However, forest fire danger models rely on fuel moisture content (FMC) as a measure of vegetation moisture. FMC is defined as the ratio of the leaf liquid water weight over the leaf dry weight. In a previous research it has been shown the potential of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) ground reflectance data in retrieving both EWT and FMC at leaf level. Though the atmosphere alters ground signature recorded by the sensor, in this paper it will be shown that a simple index can be designed that allows a fast and accurate estimation of FMC (r2 = 0.83) with MODIS data.	financial risk modeling;fundamental modeling concepts;risk assessment;thickness (graph theory)	Carmine Maffei;Antonio P.

0c98ad468d94368ef0bcded0944479a59bbc71f3	use of miniature thermal cameras for detection of physiological stress in conifers		Tree growth and survival predominantly depends on edaphic and climatic conditions, thus climate change will inevitably influence forest health and growth. It will affect forests directly, for example, through extended periods of drought, and indirectly, such as by affecting the distribution and abundance of forest pathogens and pests. Developing ways of early detection and monitoring of tree stress is crucial for effective protection of forest stands. Thermography is one of the techniques that can be used for monitoring changes in the physiological state of plants; however, in forestry, it has not been widely tested or utilized. The main challenge rises from the need for high spatial resolution data. Newly emerging technologies, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could aid in provision of the required data. However, their main constraint is the limited payload, requiring the use of miniature sensors. This paper investigates whether a miniature microbolometer thermal camera, designed for a UAV platform, can provide reliable canopy temperature measurements of conifers. Furthermore, it explores whether there is a distinction in whole canopy temperature between the control and the stressed trees, assessing the potential of low-cost thermography for investigating stress in conifers. Two experiments on young larch trees, with induced drought stress, were performed. The plants were imaged in a greenhouse setting, and readings from a set of thermocouples attached to the canopy were used as a method of validation. Following calibration and a basic normalization for background radiation, both the spatial and temporal variation of canopy temperature was well characterized. Very mild stress did not exhibit itself, as the temperature readings for both stressed and control plants were similar. However, with a higher stress level, there was a clear distinction (temperature difference of 1.5 ◦C) between the plants, showing potential for using low-cost sensors to investigate tree stress.	aerial photography;attack tree;bridging (networking);control theory;experiment;microbolometer;motorola canopy;sensor;unmanned aerial vehicle	Magdalena Smigaj;Rachel Gaulton;Juan C.

0550251175e58af78d1644df5431fe0170fa2a9d	using single-and multi-target regression to estimate biophysical parameters of crops		Estimation of biophysical parameters based on regression models is of interest for the remote sensing community since it is one of the key elements for agricultural purposes. Numerically, this problem is solved separately for each biophysical parameter such as Leaf Area Index-LAI, soil moisture, crop height and etc. However, this approach ignores tight relationship among the biophysical parameters, which is essential for driving estimation performance with a limited number of in-situ measurements. As an alternative strategy, a multi-target regression, which also learns the relationship among biophysical parameters in regression model, is considered. In order to see how multitarget regression models capture plausible physical relationship between crop's biophysical parameters and polarimetric features, RadarSAT-2 images acquired over agriculture fields in the context of AgriSAR 2009 campaign were used.	numerical integration;polarimetry	Z.

A surface roughness coefficient has been introduced which specifies the texture of a surface on a quantitative basis. Comprehensive theoretical models have been developed to study the effect of surface texture on reflected ultrasonic pulses from a rough surface. The measurement technique is based on examining the frequency spectrum of the received signals in comparison to the theoretical models. A minimisation function obtains the best match between theoretical models and actual measurements such that the resultant coefficient generated corresponding to the best match represents the surface roughness. Although the technique developed was intended to characterise materials having characteristic surface conditions such as that found in crystalline deposits, the technique may be used in general applications including automated inspection systems.

A new method is presented to minimize the parameterization error using the Rayleigh scattering limit relations multiplied with a rational polynomial function of reflectivity-weighted raindrop diameter to approximate the Mie character of scattering. A statistical relation between the shape parameter of the DSD with the median volume diameter of raindrops is derived by exploiting long-term disdrometer observations. On the basis of this relation, new optimal estimators of rain microphysical parameters and rainfall rate are developed for a wide range of rain DSDs and air temperatures using X-band scattering simulations of polarimetric radar observables. Parameterizations of radar specific path attenuation and backscattering phase shift are also developed, which do not depend on this relation. The methodology can, in principle, be applied to other weather radar frequencies. A numerical sensitivity analysis shows that calibration bias and measurement noise in radar measurements are critical factors for the total error in parameters estimation, despite the low parameterization error (less than 5%). However, for the usual errors of radar calibration and measurement noise (of the order of 1 dB, 0.2 dB, and 0.3 $\hbox{deg}\ \hbox{km}^{-1}$ for reflectivity, differential reflectivity, and specific differential propagation phase shift, respectively), the new parameterizations provide a reliable estimation of rain parameters (typically less than 20% error).	approximation algorithm;decibel;differential phase;document structure description;estimation theory;minimally invasive education;numerical analysis;observable;polarimetry;polynomial;radar;rayleigh–ritz method;simulation;software propagation	John Kalogiros;Marios N.

Based on the theory of wavelet transform (WT), this paper proposes a method for accurately and effectively separating LSTs and LSEs from field-measured hyperspectral TIR data. We show that the number of unknowns in the RTE can be reduced by decomposing and reconstructing the LSE spectrum, thus making the RTE solvable. The final results show that the errors introduced by WT are negligible. In addition, the proposed method usually achieves a greater accuracy in a wet-warm atmosphere than that in a dry-cold atmosphere. For the results under instrument noise conditions (NE∆T = 0.2 K), the overall accuracy of the LST is approximately 0.1–0.3 K, while the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the LSEs is less than 0.01. In contrast to the effects of instrument noise, our method is quite insensitive to noises from atmospheric downwelling radiance, and all the RMSEs of our method are approximately zero for both the LSTs and the LSEs. When we used field-measured data to better evaluate our method’s performance, the results showed that the RMSEs of the LSTs and LSEs were approximately 1.1 K and 0.01, respectively. The results from both simulated data and field-measured data demonstrate that our method is promising for decreasing the number of unknowns in the RTE. Furthermore, the proposed method overcomes some known limitations of current algorithms, such as singular values and the loss of continuity in the spectrum of the retrieved LSEs.	advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer;airborne ranger;algorithm;coefficient;decision problem;reflections of signals on conducting lines;requirement;scott continuity;signal-to-noise ratio;wavelet transform	Yu-Ze Zhang;Hua Wu;Xiaoguang Jiang;Ya-Zhen Jiang;Zhao-Xia Liu;Françoise Nerry	2017	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs9050454	meteorology;hyperspectral imaging;optics;remote sensing;wavelet transform	Visualization	85.01070235568704	-62.781322446545374	196043

The materials for this study included Hyperspectral data and rape biomass data. Reflectance was measured in discrete narrow bands between 350 nm (nanometers) and 2500 nm using Analytical Spectral Devices (FieldSPEC, 2002) during 2002-2003 rape growing stages at Zhejiang University Experiment Farm, Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China, located at 30°14'N,120°10'E. Observed rape biomass include dry biomass (DBM: including leaf dry biomass, stem dry biomass, fruit dry biomass) and wet biomass (WBM including leaf wet biomass, stem wet biomass, fruit wet biomass),. The optimum multiple narrow band reflectivity (OMNBR) involving all possible two-band combinations were tested. Results are as follows: The correlation coefficient of the four-variable OMNBR model provided the highest relativity than other three models (one-variable OMNBR model, two-variable OMNBR model, fivevariable OMNBR model). The best bands that estimate rape biomass yield in four-variable OMNBR models located in the longer portion of green, the longer portion of red, the red-edge, the longer potion of NIR (near-infrared). The best estimation models of rape biomass yield (Bdry for dry biomass and Bwet for wet biomass) are four-variable models as Table II.

e9d87b85aaf01829fccacf79bf7db900d716001b	comparison of passive microwave-derived early melt onset records on arctic sea ice	sea ice;passive microwave;arctic;melt;melt onset	Two long records of melt onset (MO) on Arctic sea ice from passive microwave brightness temperatures (Tbs) obtained by a series of satellite-borne instruments are compared. The Passive Microwave (PMW) method and Advanced Horizontal Range Algorithm (AHRA) detect the increase in emissivity that occurs when liquid water develops around snow grains at the onset of early melting on sea ice. The timing of MO on Arctic sea ice influences the amount of solar radiation absorbed by the ice–ocean system throughout the melt season by reducing surface albedos in the early spring. This work presents a thorough comparison of these two methods for the time series of MO dates from 1979 through 2012. The methods are first compared using the published data as a baseline comparison of the publically available data products. A second comparison is performed on adjusted MO dates we produced to remove known differences in inter-sensor calibration of Tbs and masking techniques used to develop the original MO date products. These adjustments result in a more consistent set of input Tbs for the algorithms. Tests of significance indicate that the trends in the time series of annual mean MO dates for the PMW and AHRA are statistically different for the majority of the Arctic Ocean including the Laptev, E. Siberian, Chukchi, Beaufort, and central Arctic regions with mean differences as large as 38.3 days in the Barents Sea. Trend agreement improves for our more consistent MO dates for nearly all regions. Mean differences remain large, primarily due to differing sensitivity of in-algorithm thresholds and larger uncertainties in thin-ice regions.	algorithm;audio home recording act;bliss;baseline (configuration management);beaufort cipher;microwave;onset (audio);procedural programming;source data;time series	Angela C.

f67a1138dd4f27a4a3fc4501ad44719ad7eb76d1	mod2sea: a coupled atmosphere-hydro-optical model for the retrieval of chlorophyll-a from remote sensing observations in complex turbid waters	wadden sea;meris;atmospheric correction;chlorophyll a;c2r;remote sensing;2seacolor;modtran	An accurate estimation of the chlorophyll-a (Chla) concentration is crucial for water quality monitoring and is highly desired by various government agencies and environmental groups. However, using satellite observations for Chla estimation remains problematic over coastal waters due to their optical complexity and the critical atmospheric correction. In this study, we coupled an atmospheric and a water optical model for the simultaneous atmospheric correction and retrieval of Chla in the complex waters of the Wadden Sea. This coupled model called MOD2SEA combines simulations from the MODerate resolution atmospheric TRANsmission model (MODTRAN) and the two-stream radiative transfer hydro-optical model 2SeaColor. The accuracy of the coupled MOD2SEA model was validated using a matchup data set of MERIS (MEdium Resolution Imaging SpectRometer) observations and four years of concurrent ground truth measurements (2007–2010) at the NIOZ jetty location in the Dutch part of the Wadden Sea. The results showed that MERIS-derived Chla from MOD2SEA explained the variations of measured Chla with a determination coefficient of R2 = 0.88 and a RMSE of 3.32 mg·m−3, which means a significant improvement in comparison with the standard MERIS Case 2 regional (C2R) processor. The proposed coupled model might be used to generate a time series of reliable Chla maps, which is of profound importance for the assessment of causes and consequences of long-term phenological changes of Chla in the turbid Wadden Sea area.	algorithm;coefficient;ground truth;modtran;map;simulation;time of arrival;time series	Behnaz Arabi;Mhd.

0a5c97902cec2df10339d01a954c4ee8f51d3dee	winter wheat yield forecasting in ukraine based on earth observation, meteorological data and biophysical models	ukraine;yield;remote sensing;wheat;agriculture	Ukraine is one of the most developed agriculture countries and one of the biggest crop producers in the world. Timely and accurate crop yield forecasts for Ukraine at regional level become a key element in providing support to policy makers in food security. In this paper, feasibility and relative efficiency of using moderate resolution satellite data to winter wheat forecasting in Ukraine at oblast level is assessed. Oblast is a sub-national administrative unit that corresponds to the NUTS2 level of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) of the European Union. NDVI values were derived from the MODIS sensor at the 250 m spatial resolution. For each oblast NDVI values were averaged for a cropland map (Rainfed croplands class) derived from the ESA GlobCover map, and were used as predictors in the regression models. Using a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure, the best time for making reliable yield forecasts in terms of root mean square error was identified. For most oblasts, NDVI values taken in April–May provided the minimum RMSE value when comparing to the official statistics, thus enabling forecasts 2–3 months prior to harvest. The NDVI-based approach was compared to the following approaches: empirical model based on meteorological observations (with forecasts in April–May that provide minimum RMSE value) and WOFOST crop growth simulation model implemented in the CGMS system (with forecasts in June that provide minimum RMSE value). All three approaches were run to produce winter wheat yield forecasts for independent datasets for 2010 and 2011, i.e. on data that were not used within model calibration process. The most accurate predictions for 2010 were achieved using the CGMS system with the RMSE value of 0.3 t ha −1  in June and 0.4 t ha −1  in April, while performance of three approaches for 2011 was almost the same (0.5–0.6 t ha −1  in April). Both NDVI-based approach and CGMS system overestimated winter wheat yield comparing to official statistics in 2010, and underestimated it in 2011. Therefore, we can conclude that performance of empirical NDVI-based regression model was similar to meteorological and CGMS models when producing winter wheat yield forecasts at oblast level in Ukraine 2–3 months prior to harvest, while providing minimum requirements to input datasets.	mathematical model	Felix N.

Previous studies have focused on growing stock volume (GSV), which represents the current potential of timber production, yet few studies have investigated historical process-harvested timber. This resulted in a gap in a synthetical ecosystem service assessment of timber production. In this paper, we established a Management Process–based Timber production (MPT) framework to integrate the current GSV and the harvested timber derived from historical logging regimes, trying to synthetically assess timber production for a historical period. In the MPT framework, age-class and current GSV determine the times of historical thinning and the corresponding harvested timber, by using a “space-for-time” substitution. The total timber production can be estimated by the historical harvested timber in each thinning and the current GSV. To test this MPT framework, an empirical study on a larch plantation (LP) with area of 43,946 ha was conducted in North China for a period from 1962 to 2010. Field-based inventory data was integrated with ALOS PALSAR (Advanced Land-Observing Satellite Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) and Landsat-8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) data for estimating the age-class and current GSV of LP. The random forest model with PALSAR backscatter intensity channels and OLI bands as input predictive variables yielded an accuracy of 67.9% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.59 for age-class classification. The regression model using PALSAR data produced a root mean square error (RMSE) of 36.5 m3 ha−1. The total timber production of LP was estimated to be 7.27 × 106 m3, with 4.87 × 106 m3 in current GSV and 2.40 × 106 m3 in harvested timber through historical thinning. The historical process-harvested timber accounts to 33.0% of the total timber production, which component has been neglected in the assessments for current status of plantation forests. Synthetically considering the RMSE for predictive GSV and misclassification of age-class, the error in timber production were supposed to range from −55.2 to 56.3 m3 ha−1. The MPT framework can be used to assess timber production of other tree species at a larger spatial scale, providing crucial information for a better understanding of forest ecosystem service.	inventory;multi-source	Tian Gao;Jiaojun Zhu;Songqiu Deng;Xiao Zheng;Jinxin Zhang;Guiduo Shang;Liyan Huang	2016	Int.

Particularly, the use of mechanical profilers as compared to more precise laser profilers is investigated. The motivations for this study are twofold. First, simple and inexpensive mechanical profilers will probably still be used extensively forin situ ground measurements in the next few years, e.g., to investigate the use of multipolarization, multiincidence angle satellite data, i.e., Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) onboard the European Space Agency Environmental Satellite. Second, a great amount of roughness data have been acquired in the past by means of mechanical profilers and, to date, a quantification of the error budget affecting these measurements is still missing. The paper focuses on modeling and quantifying the measurement errors associated with profiles a few meters long. To determine the errors, we compare soil roughness measurements obtained using laser and mechanical profilers over agricultural surfaces with different roughness characteristics. The analyzed datasets consist of roughness measurements acquired over the Matera site (Italy) and the Marestaing site, near Toulouse (France), in 1998 and 2000, respectively. Analytical expressions for first and second statistical moments of roughness parameters as a function of different sources of measurement errors are derived and compared to experimental values. The results show that mechanical measurements, once appropriately calibrated, are in overall good agreement with laser measurements. Practical indications of the most appropriate profiler length and number of independent measurements to be recorded are also derived in the paper.	aperture (software);norm (social);profiling (computer programming);synthetic data	Francesco Mattia;Malcolm Davidson;Thuy Le Toan;Christophe M.

In the biosphere, lightning is important as the main natural ignition source for wildfires and because of its contribution to the nitrogen cycle. Therefore, it is important to develop lightning climatologies to characterise and monitor lightning activity. While traditional methods for constructing lightning climatologies are suitable for examining lightning’s influence on atmospheric processes, they are less well suited for examining questions about biosphere-lightning interactions. For example, examining the interaction between lightning and wildfires requires linking atmospheric processes to finer scale terrestrial processes and patterns. Most wildfires ignited by lightning are less than one hectare in size, and so require lightning climatologies at a comparable spatial resolution. However, such high resolution lightning climatologies cannot be derived using the traditional cell-count methodology. Here we present a novel geocomputational approach for analysing lightning data at high spatial resolutions. Our approach is based on probabilistic computational methods and is capable of producing a sub-kilometre lightning climatology that honours the spatial accuracy of the strike locations and is adaptive to underlying spatial patterns. We demonstrate our methods by applying them to the mid-latitude oceanic landmass of New Zealand, an area with geographic conditions that are under-represented in existing lightning climatologies. Our resulting lightning climatology has unparalleled spatial resolution, and the spatial and temporal patterns we observe in it are consistent with other continental and tropical lightning climatologies. To encourage further use and development of our probabilistic approach, we provide Python scripts that demonstrate the method alongside our resulting New Zealand lightning climatology.	biosphere;computation;image resolution;interaction;köppen climate classification;lightning (connector);positive feedback;probabilistic turing machine;python;terrestrial television	Thomas R.

The coefficients of the SW algorithm were determined based on atmospheric water vapor sub-ranges, which were obtained through a modified split-window covariance–variance ratio method. The channel emissivities were acquired from newly released global land cover products at 30 m and from a fraction of the vegetation cover calculated from visible and near-infrared images aboard Landsat 8. Simulation results showed that the new algorithm can obtain LST with an accuracy of better than 1.0 K. The model consistency to the noise of the brightness temperature, emissivity and water vapor was conducted, which indicated the robustness of the new algorithm in LST retrieval. Furthermore, based on comparisons, the new algorithm performed better than the existing algorithms in retrieving LST from TIRS data. Finally, the SW algorithm was proven to be reliable through application in different regions. To further confirm the credibility of the SW algorithm, the LST will be validated in the future.	coefficient;genetic algorithm;shattered world;simulation	Chen Du;Huazhong Ren;Qiming Qin;Jinjie Meng;Shaohua Zhao	2015	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs70100647	meteorology;hydrology;remote sensing	ML	84.50011656407428	-61.213001448555005	198914

However, common methods of vegetation classification often fail to cover variability of ecological surface parameter, especially in transition zones. In this paper we analyze the potential of two hyperspectral sensors (HyMap, AISA) to bridge ecological models with spectral information in order to map vegetational continuum, habitat types as well as assessment categories for legal authorities. As a first step a new method of aggregating ordination space structure via Kriging estimators were introduced to parameterize vegetation characteristics. With regard to future sensor design a higher spectral resolution could be detected as preferable in predicting ordination axes metrics with PLS-models. Furthermore an increasing spatial resolution was identified as a key factor observing small scale heterogeneity for habitat encroachment whereas habitat distinction can be adequately realized on the basis of occurrence probabilities.	habitat;hymap;kriging;sensor;spatial variability;triune continuum paradigm	Carsten Neumann;Sibylle Itzerott;Gabriele Weiss	2012	2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6351744	imaging spectroscopy;hydrology;probability;statistics;remote sensing	Robotics	86.89753369820278	-60.43701606470822	199272

NRCS derived from TS-X is compared with the simulated NRCS using the C-band GMF CMOD5 and the Ku-band GMF NSCAT4. The wind velocity is ranged from 25 to 36 m s-1 in the analysis. Results show the Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) between the CMOD5 simulations and the observations of TS-X is 1.7 dB, while it decreases to 0.86 dB in the comparisons between NSCAT4 simulations and TS-X observations. We also investigate the effect of NRCS by rain on X-band SAR, related to high winds. Analysis shows that NRCS from NSCAT4 is closer to TS-X than CMOD5, even at high rain rates. Besides, rainfall enlarges the difference of NRCS on Ku-band, X-band and C-band at a low rain rate (<;5 mm h-1), while rainfall lessens the difference when the rain rate is greater than 5 mm h-1. However, NRCS on Ku-band, X-band and C-band SAR tend to be approached when wind velocity increases at various rain rates.	graphical modeling framework;ku band;l band;mean squared error;simulation;typhoon;velocity (software development)	Weizeng Shao;Xiaoming Li	2016	2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730200	wind speed;meteorology;synthetic aperture radar;atmospheric sciences;tropical cyclone;geology;physics;remote sensing	Mobile	83.109040420924	-63.3644477316914	199450

The study examines the ice movement in the Fram Strait during a two-week period in April, 2011. The results indicate that the HIROMB model overestimates the drift speed by a factor 1 - 2.5, which may be attributed to an underestimated thickness of the ice. The model data also exhibit a directional offset in the positive clockwise direction of 10 - 30 degrees over the whole study region.

In situ measurements of SWD radiation at time scales from 5 to 55 min from the Oklahoma MesoNet and the Baseline Surface Radiation Network sites over the U.S. are employed to examine the temporal scaling behavior of surface downward radiation and to evaluate the estimates based on MODIS observations from both Terra and Aqua platforms. Analysis reveals that the surface SWD radiation derived from MODIS Terra is in better agreement with ground observations than those from MODIS Aqua. Spatial scaling behavior is investigated based on the MODIS-derived SWD radiation at scales varying from 5 to 100 km. The root mean square difference and the mean standard deviation are found to be highly correlated with the scale exhibiting a strong log-linear relationship. This is a first study on the scaling behavior for surface SWD. Such information is expected to provide linkage between different satellite-based radiation data sets including those derived from geostationary satellites usually of coarser spatial resolutions.	2.5d;aqua;geosynchronous satellite;image scaling;linkage (software);log-linear model;maxima and minima;mean squared error	Hongbo Su;Eric F.
