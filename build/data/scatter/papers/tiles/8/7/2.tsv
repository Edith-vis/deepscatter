Usually, sound-absorbing cotton or directional microphones are applied on the hardware to suppress the background noise that caused by the unwanted signals, such as sound of wind and human voice. In addition, the channel effects are generated among various voice-processing systems when voice signals are transferred. This paper takes advantages of the Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFN), in which the noise signals can be figured simply in time period without the transfer through frequency domain, by matching the features of the sources of speech signals within the samples speech frame, the authentic speech signals can be restored. The simulation results show that the propose RBFN method works well to reduce the noise signals and provides the same quality as the original speech signals under Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN).	additive model;additive white gaussian noise;microphone;noise reduction;radial (radio);radial basis function;simulation	Jui-Chuan Cheng;Te-Jen Su;Tsung-Ying Li;Chia-Hua Wu	2015	2015 International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing (IIH-MSP)	10.1109/IIH-MSP.2015.111	voice activity detection;gaussian noise;computer vision;linear predictive coding;speech recognition;colors of noise;computer science;noise measurement;speech;digital signal processing;speech coding;noise;noise reduction;speech processing;noise floor;signal-to-noise ratio;frequency domain	EDA	83.51353964488555	-32.91814560832727	18994

The HRTF-based RLSFI beamformer accounts for the influence of a robot's head on the sound field. The performance of the new HRTF-based RLSFI beamformer is evaluated using signal-based measures and word error rates for an off-the-shelf speech recognizer, and is compared to the performance of the original free-field RLSFI beamformer design. The experimental results confirm the efficacy of the proposed HRTF-based beamformer design for robot audition.	beamforming;finite-state machine;head-related transfer function;least squares;robot;speech recognition	Hendrik Barfuss;Christian Huemmer;Gleni Lamani;Andreas Schwarz;Walter Kellermann	2015	2015 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)	10.1109/WASPAA.2015.7336933	electronic engineering;speech recognition;acoustics;computer science;engineering;adaptive beamformer;robustness	Robotics	85.11236522650415	-35.20151542074697	19265

Recently, sparseness based blind separation has been actively studied. However, most methods utilize a linear sensor array (or only two sensors), and therefore have certain limitations; e.g., they cannot be applied to symmetrically positioned sources. To allow the use of more than two sensors that can be arranged in a non-linear/non-uniform way, we propose a new method that includes the normalization and clustering of the observation vectors. We report promising results for the speech separation of 3-dimensionally distributed five sources with a non-linear/non-uniform array of four sensors in a room (RT60= 120 ms).	blind signal separation;cluster analysis;database normalization;neural coding;nonlinear system;sensor;source separation;sparse matrix	Shoko Araki;Hiroshi Sawada;Ryo Mukai;Shoji Makino	2006	2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference		electronic engineering;speech recognition;engineering;machine learning;blind signal separation	Robotics	84.03800563863997	-37.11554113246594	19898

The experimental results show that for an unwarped predictor of order ten, the order of the warped predictor can be reduced by two for the same speech quality. The audible differences between the normal and the warped predictors are very small, so the statements of the test subjects are widely spread. The measured noise of the system with the warped predictor is about 2 dB higher than the normal predictor, but it has lower audible noise. However, the plosives (p, t, etc.) are more blurred. The measured SNR was taken from the difference of the signals before the preemphasis filter and behind the deemphasis filter at the end of the system. Comparing the computing time needed to obtain the predictor coefficients, the difference between the normal and the warped predictor is negligible. >	speech processing	Elmar Krüger;Hans Werner Strube	1988	IEEE Trans.

Even though acoustic signals are often corrupted in the high noise level environment, speech recognition systems such as the widely-used HTK do not deal with signal distortion problems. We propose an architecture that effectively combines adaptive beamforming (ABF) and blind source separation (BSS) algorithms in the spatial domain. To avoid permutation ambiguity and heavy computational complexity in the BSS system, the adaptive generalized sidelobe canceller is employed in front of the BSS system. We slightly modified the conventional convolutive mixture model of the BSS for fast processing in hardware implementations. Unlike the conventional BSS, this does not suffer from permutation ambiguity since the target angle of the front-line beamformer is fixed so it always provides enhanced and reference noise signals to the predefined two inputs of the BSS. The proposed system also reduces heavy computations in the BSS when the BSS have more than two inputs. The proposed time domain approach can be easily implemented into hardware in real-time. We evaluated the structure and assessed its performance with a DSP module. The experimental results of speech recognition test show that the proposed combined system guarantees high speech recognition rate in the noisy environment and better performance than the ABF and BSS system.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;ambiguity function;applications-by-forms;beamforming;blind signal separation;computation;computational complexity theory;digital signal processor;distortion;htk (software);mixture model;noise (electronics);preprocessor;real-time clock;reference noise;robot;sensitivity and specificity;source separation;speech recognition	Sungmin Woo;Sanghoon Lee;Hong Jeong	2007	The 2007 International Conference on Intelligent Pervasive Computing (IPC 2007)	10.1109/IPC.2007.72	speech recognition;computer science;multimedia;communication	Robotics	85.35490616409855	-35.051258327550855	20468

A generalized spectral weighting rule based on estimations for the spectral variances of the late reverberant speech and background noise is used for speech enhancement. This allows to suppress speech distortions due to late room reflections without knowledge about the complete room impulse response. In contrast to existing methods, all needed quantities are estimated entire blindly from the reverberant and noisy speech signal. The new algorithm has also a low signal delay which is important, e.g., for speech enhancement in mobile communication devices or hearing aids.	algorithm;amiga reflections;distortion;speech enhancement;zero suppression	Heinrich W.

First, open loop system transfer functions are designed using a theoretical propagation model. The transfer functions thus found are regarded as the nominal values for the complete system. Second, to compensate for deviations from the theoretical model, the transfer functions are adapted using error measures from error sensor array by LMS algorithm.

However, it is difficult to obtain the model parameters from measurements when the number of exponentials in the sum is unknown or the terms are strongly correlated. Traditionally, the time constants and residues are estimated by nonlinear iterative search. In this paper, a constrained linear method of estimating the parameters is formulated by enumerating the relaxation parameter space and imposing a nonnegative constraint on the parameters. The resulting algorithm does not depend on a good initial guess to converge to a solution. By using tests on synthetic data and laboratory measurement of known targets, the proposed method is shown to provide accurate and stable estimates of the model parameters.	algorithm;converge;iterative method;linear programming relaxation;nonlinear system;strongly correlated material;synthetic data	Mu-Hsin Wei;Waymond R.

The received signal embeds the motion attributes of the source via Doppler effect. In this paper, we analyze the Doppler effect on mixture of time-varying sinusoids. Focusing, on the instantaneous frequency (IF) of the received signal, we show that the IF profile composed of IF and its first two derivatives can be used to obtain source motion parameters. This requires a smooth estimate of IF profile. However, the numerical implementation of traditional approaches, such as analytic signal and energy separation approach, gives oscillatory behavior hence a non-smooth IF estimate. We devise an algorithm using non-uniformly spaced signal extrema samples of the received signal for smooth IF profile estimation. Using the smooth IF profiles for a source moving on a linear trajectory with constant velocity, an accurate estimate of moving source parameters is obtained. We see promise of this approach for an arbitrary trajectory motion parameter estimation.	algorithm;analytic signal;british informatics olympiad;covox speech thing;doppler effect;estimation theory;industrial robot;instantaneous phase;low-power broadcasting;microphone;numerical analysis;robotics;velocity (software development)	Neeraj Kumar Sharma;Sai Gunaranjan Pelluri;Thippur V.

The extremely cold temperatures, along with the existence of inversion layers in the temperature gradients, make the medium highly inhomogeneous. Its properties, including the index of refraction that rules the behavior of light, are no longer constant. As a consequence, light rays get bent while traversing the atmosphere, and the result is some spectacular phenomena; several examples are the arctic mirages (that have probably given rise to numerous ghost ship legends), the Fata Morgana or the Novaya-Zemlya effect. We present here an implementation of a ray tracer that can render all these effects, thus depicting phenomena never ray-traced before, as far as the authors know. We first build an accurate temperature profile for the arctic atmosphere, based on experimental data, then calculate the curved paths of the light rays as the index of refraction changes as a function of temperature, by solving the physically-based differential equation that describes their trajectory. The scenes are modelled using real data for the Earth and Sun dimensions and relative distance, thus maintaining accuracy in the results obtained.		Diego Gutierrez;Francisco J.

Assuming a single speech source, the rank-one property of the speech correlation matrix can be exploited to derive the so-called rank-one MWF (R1-MWF). In this paper, we present an alternative formulation of the MWF (A-MWF), which exploits the assumed rank-one property of the speech correlation matrix in a different way as the R1-MWF. Furthermore, we present a theoretical robustness analysis of the different MWF formulations in presence of spatially white noise. Experimental results show that similarly to the R1-MWF, the proposed A-MWF is less sensitive to estimation errors of the speech correlation matrix and yields a higher output SNR than the standard MWF.	microphone;noise reduction;signal-to-noise ratio;white noise;wiener filter	Toby Christian Lawin-Ore;Sebastian Stenzel;Jürgen Freudenberger;Simon Doclo	2014	2014 14th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)	10.1109/IWAENC.2014.6954008	electronic engineering;speech recognition;acoustics;computer science;wiener filter	ML	83.43524421454681	-35.6126128500357	23188

The discussion focuses mainly on reducing the dimensions of mixed signals before applying independent component analysis. We compare two previously proposed methods. The first is based on principal component analysis, where noise reduction is achieved. The second is based on geometric considerations and selects a subset of sensors in accordance with the fact that a low frequency prefers a wide spacing, and a high frequency prefers a narrow spacing. We found that the PCA-based method behaves similarly to the geometry-based method for low frequencies in the way that it emphasizes the outer sensors and yields superior results for high frequencies. These results provide a better understanding of the former method.	blind signal separation;independent component analysis;noise reduction;principal component analysis;sensor;source separation	Stefan Winter;Hiroshi Sawada;Shoji Makino	2006	EURASIP J.

In this framework, we start by formulating the minimum-mean-square error (MMSE)-based solution in the context of multiple simultaneous speakers and background noise, and outline the importance of the estimation of the activities of the speakers. The latter is accurately achieved by introducing a latent variable that takes N+1 possible discrete states for a mixture of N speech signals plus additive noise. Each state characterizes the dominance of one of the N+1 signals. We determine the posterior probability of this latent variable, and show how it plays a twofold role in the MMSE-based speech enhancement. First, it allows the extraction of the second order statistics of the noise and each of the speech signals from the noisy data. These statistics are needed to formulate the multichannel Wiener-based filters (including the minimum variance distortionless response). Second, it weighs the outputs of these linear filters to shape the spectral contents of the signals' estimates following the associated target speakers' activities. We use the spatial and spectral cues contained in the multichannel recordings of the sound mixtures to compute the posterior probability of this latent variable. The spatial cue is acquired by using the normalized observation vector whose distribution is well approximated by a Gaussian-mixture-like model, while the spectral cue can be captured by using a pre-trained Gaussian mixture model for the log-spectra of speech. The parameters of the investigated models and the speakers' activities (posterior probabilities of the different states of the latent variable) are estimated via expectation maximization. Experimental results including comparisons with the well-known independent component analysis and masking are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed framework.	acoustic cryptanalysis;additive white gaussian noise;approximation algorithm;entropy maximization;expectation–maximization algorithm;independent component analysis;latent variable;mixture model;multi-source;neural coding;noise reduction;powered speakers;signal-to-noise ratio;software propagation;source separation;speech enhancement;stellar classification;utility functions on indivisible goods;whole earth 'lectronic link	Mehrez Souden;Shoko Araki;Keisuke Kinoshita;Tomohiro Nakatani;Hiroshi Sawada	2013	IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing	10.1109/TASL.2013.2263137	normal distribution;speech recognition;pattern recognition;probability;mathematics;blind signal separation;statistics	ML	82.92955811641716	-36.39803857101282	23558

The process design for creating the desired shape still largely depends on a trial-and-error basis. Therefore, in order to reduce the cost and to accelerate product development, it is important to utilize computer-aided design tools. A method, called as element growth method, which is based on digital convolution approach, is developed and presented under an OpenGL environment to reduce the cost and the developmental period for fabrication. By using such a convolution approach, this emulator converts the processing parameters into a final spatial-dosage distribution and subsequently into the final geometry of structures. In addition, a physically based kernel function is also proposed and used. Examples of 3-D microstructures such as the microlens are presented. By these tools, it is possible to provide guidelines for optimizing the fabrication process and to reduce the cost for the related e-beam lithography-based 3-D fabrication.	computer-aided design;convolution;electron beam tomography;emulator;explanation-based learning;new product development;opengl;semiconductor device fabrication	Hsiu-Ming Yeh;Kuo-Shen Chen	2009	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2008.2006030	electron-beam lithography;lithography;molecular dynamics;electronic engineering;process simulation;electronic design automation;microstructure;engineering;nanotechnology;engineering drawing;physics	EDA	85.12015791349401	-24.55109229387035	24341

In classical methods, as the numerical processings of the signals concern T - duration windows, there results that the spectral resolution is limited by the Doppler spreading effect on spectral lines, and also that the source imaging is deteriorated by the blurring effect (VT) whose order of magnitude may reach the dimensions of the source. The purpose of this paper is to propose a method which takes advantage of the knowledge of the source motion to suppress the Doppler and blurring effects through an appropriate choice of sampling times. We present the mathematical formulation, which is illustrated by real applications on vehicles (motor car and air cushion train).	acoustic cryptanalysis	Jacques Hay	1981		10.1109/ICASSP.1981.1171132	speech recognition;image resolution;signal processing	Vision	86.21009764316392	-38.41836564859599	24421

A large class of acoustic noise sources have an underlying periodic process that generates a periodic noise component, and thus the acoustic noise can in general be modeled as the sum of a periodic signal and a random signal (usually a background noise). In this paper we present the idea that separating the acoustic noise into periodic and random noise components and doing separate active noise control(ANC) for each tends to increase the over-all noise attenuation level (NAL). Formulae for the exact improvement in noise attenuation levels are derived. A novel signal separation and noise cancelation scheme based on adaptive filtering is developed and its effectiveness is shown for several periodic signal in white noise cases.	acoustic cryptanalysis;adaptive filter;network abstraction layer;noise (electronics);signal-to-noise ratio;stochastic process;white noise	Govind Kannan;Ali A.

The proposed approach provides an ef cient and uni ed framework for such procedures as AES gain computation, AES gain modi cation using soft decision, and estimation of relevant parameters based on the same statistical model assumption of the near-end and far-end signal instead of the conventional strategies requiring the additional residual echo suppression (RES) step. Performances of the proposed AES algorithm are evaluated by objective tests under various environments and better results compared with the conventional AES method are obtained.	acoustic coupler;acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;computation;echo suppression and cancellation;performance;statistical model;zero suppression	Yun-Sik Park;Ji-Hyun Song;Jae-Hun Choi;Joon-Hyuk Chang	2009			speech recognition;telecommunications;computer science;frequency domain	Vision	83.04859157745301	-33.69947437348825	24584
e78336a5bbed3e606275683bf6d193adb1e1ce97	measurement of sound fields using moving microphones		The sampling of sound fields involves the measurement of spatially dependent room impulse responses, where the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem applies in both the temporal and spatial domains. Therefore, sampling inside a volume of interest requires a huge number of sampling points in space, which comes along with further difficulties such as exact microphone positioning and calibration of multiple microphones. In this paper, we present a method for measuring sound fields using moving microphones whose trajectories are known to the algorithm. At that, the number of microphones is customizable by trading measurement effort against sampling time. Through spatial interpolation of the dynamic measurements, a system of linear equations is set up which allows for the reconstruction of the entire sound field inside the volume of interest.	algorithm;linear equation;microphone;multivariate interpolation;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;region of interest;sampling (signal processing);shannon (unit);system of linear equations	Fabrice Katzberg;Radoslaw Mazur;Marco Maaß;Philipp Koch;Alfred Mertins	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7952753	speech recognition;acoustics;mathematics	Robotics	87.80962042527219	-38.66044659166811	24773

The time axis scaling model is based on the fact that the change of the sound velocity due to the change of room temperature is a dominant factor for the variations of room impulse response affected by environmental conditions. In this paper, the effectiveness of the compensation method is evaluated using room impulse responses measured in the real environment. As the results, it is clarified that the variations of room impulse response can be modeled by the first-order approximated time axis scaling when the successive re-estimation is performed every small change of temperature. Furthermore, it is shown that the compensation method applied to an inverse filtering based dereverberation approach improves the intelligibility and speech recognition rates dramatically.	acoustic cryptanalysis;apache axis;approximation algorithm;chinese room;first-order reduction;image scaling;intelligibility (philosophy);inverse filter;order of approximation;speech recognition;transfer function;velocity (software development)	Michiaki Omura;Motohiko Yada;Hiroshi Saruwatari;Shoji Kajita;Kazuya Takeda;Fumitada Itakura	1999		10.1109/ICASSP.1999.759827	speech recognition;acoustical engineering;transfer function	Robotics	85.20164375893357	-33.587760343590055	25268

Often these techniques separate the modelling problem in two: first and attempt is made to estimate the vocal tract impulse response; then an ARMA model is fit to such impulse response. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a different approach which is best-suited for speech analysis. This approach consist in first deriving from the speech signal a running approximation of a pseudo glottal excitation. Using a sequential minimization technique, the parameters of the ARMA model are then derived to fit a system whose input is the excitation signal and whose output is the speech signal.		R.

The method relies on the assumption that in the neighborhood of some time-frequency points, only one source contributes to the mixture. Such time-frequency points, located with a local confidence measure, provide estimates of the attenuation, as well as the phase difference at some frequency, of the corresponding source. The time delay parameters are estimated, by a method similar to GCC-PHAT, on points having close attenuations. As opposed to DUET like methods, our method can estimate time-delay higher than only one sample. Experiments show that DEMIX anechoic estimates, in more than 65% of the cases, the number of directions until 6 sources and outperforms DUET in the accuracy of the estimation by a factor of 10.	broadcast delay;decade (log scale);experiment	Simon Arberet;Rémi Gribonval;Frédéric Bimbot	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - ICASSP '07	10.1109/ICASSP.2007.366787	speech recognition;time–frequency analysis;computer science;signal processing;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	83.6519757574859	-36.02402557117357	26219

It is assumed that the user is close enough to the machine to be considered as a point source. The noise is a diffuse background noise, created by all the sources present in the environment. The proposed method aims at suppressing the diffuse background noise efficiently without distorting the speech estimate. This method is a modification of a method combining frequency domain blind signal separation (FD-BSS) and Wiener filter based postprocessing. Contrary to the conventional approach, we modify the estimate of the diffuse background noise given by FD-BSS before applying the Wiener filter based post-processing. We also have to build a modified observation using the FD-BSS in order to apply our modified post-processing. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can achieve a better speech enhancement, measured in term of word recognition in a speech recognition task, than the conventional Wiener filter based post-processing.	blind signal separation;distortion;microphone;simulation;speech enhancement;speech recognition;video post-processing;wiener filter	Jani Even;Hiroshi Saruwatari;Kiyohiro Shikano	2009	2009 17th European Signal Processing Conference		speech recognition;acoustics;computer science;wiener filter;communication;wiener deconvolution	ML	84.217293297283	-35.02960211116606	26231

This \magnitude-only"""" representation allows the model to directly match unwanted speech formants that arise over nonlinear channels and that are a potential source of degradation in speaker and speech recognition algorithms. As such, the method is particularly suited to algorithms that use only spectral magnitude information. The distortion model consists of a memoryless polynomial nonlinearity sandwiched between two nite-length linear lters. Minimization of a mean-squared spectral magnitude error, with respect to model parameters, relies on iterative estimation via a gradient descent technique, using a Jacobian in the iterative correction term with gradients calculated by nite-element approximation.

Comparing with impulse signals, the chirp signal is more robust against environmental noise due to its specific spectro-temporal structure, which can be easily detected using a spectro-temporal modulation filtering mechanism. In this paper, we demonstrate a system which employs the two-dimensional spectro-temporal filtering mechanism on Fourier spectrogram to measure the total energy of reverberations of the chirp signal and compares the energy difference between consecutive chirps with a predefined threshold to automatically detect the change of the acoustic scene. Simulation results show the proposed system is very effective in detecting the acoustic scene change in a real living room with great robustness against noise recorded from real-world.	acoustic cryptanalysis;chirp;modulation;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectrogram	Chang-Hong Lin;Kah-Meng Cheong;Mao-Chang Huang;Ming-Yen Chen;Chen-Kuei Chang;Tai-Shih Chi	2016	2016 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA)	10.1109/APSIPA.2016.7820783	electronic engineering;speech recognition;acoustics;engineering	Robotics	85.44035260284598	-39.624367581646865	27469

With the prevalence of modern adaptive processing strategies (e.g., level-dependent frequency response, multi-band compression etc.) it has become increasingly important to evaluate hearing aids using test stimuli that are representative of the signals a hearing aid will be expected to process (e.g., speech). Nearly all current hearing aid tests use stationary test signals that can characterize only the steady-state performance of a hearing aid. The present research examines the characteristics of automatic signal processing hearing aids with natural-speech input signals that may cause the hearing aid response to time-vary. They have investigated a number of linear system identification techniques that can be used to develop time-varying models of hearing aids. Using these models, one can begin to characterize performance of hearing aids with real-world signals and explore speech-based transient distortion measures.		Todd Schneider;Donald G.

Two types of gratings were used, defined by sinusoidal and square waveforms, with spatial wavelengths of 0.2 to 25.6 mm. The results indicated that the participants demonstrated a higher sensitivity (i.e., lower detection threshold) to square-wave gratings than to sinusoidal ones at all the wavelengths tested. When the square-wave gratings were represented by the explicative Fourier series, it became apparent that the detectability of the square-wave gratings could be determined by that of the sinusoidal gratings at the corresponding fundamental frequencies.

The system has two different input signals: the magnetic background field (natural + artificial) and a signal composed by the mag- netic background field and the signal due to the target magnetic field. The system uses the first signal as filter for the second one to detect the target magnetic signal. The effectiveness of the procedure is related to the position of the magnetic field observation points (reference devices and sentinel devices). The sentinel devices must obtain correlation in the noise observations and de-correlations in the target signal observations.

The fluctuation of room transfer functions degrades reproduced sound in conventional sound reproduction systems in which the coefficients of the inverse filter are fixed. In order to resolve this problem, an iterative relaxation algorithm for an inverse filter performed by truncated singular value decomposition (adaptive TSVD) has been proposed. However, it is difficult to apply this method within the time duration of the sound of speech or music in the original signals. Therefore, we extend adaptive TSVD to an on-line-type algorithm based on the observed signal at only one control point, normalizing the observed signal with the original sound. The result of the simulation using real environmental data reveals that the proposed method can always carry out the relaxation process against acoustic fluctuation, for any time duration. Also, subjective evaluation in the real acoustic environment indicates that the sound quality improves without degrading the localization.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;inverse filter;linear programming relaxation;quantum fluctuation;relaxation (iterative method)	Yosuke Tatekura;Shigefumi Urata;Hiroshi Saruwatari;Kiyohiro Shikano	2005	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietfec/e88-a.7.1747	adaptive filter;speech recognition;kernel adaptive filter;telecommunications;reproductive system	Vision	83.69159837924188	-34.927151623557045	29580
3f2ed1ccc76435504bee0ee3c0199fe1b97c65d5	completing the rtf vector for an mvdr beamformer as applied to a local microphone array and an external microphone		A minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer can be an effective multi-microphone noise reduction strategy’ provided that a vector of transfer functions from the desired speech signal at a reference microphone to the other microphones, i.e. a vector of the relative transfer functions (RTFs), is known. When using a local microphone array (LMA) and an external microphone (XM), this RTF vector has two distinct parts: an RTF vector for that of only the LMA and a single RTF component for the XM, with the reference microphone on the LMA. Whereas a priori assumptions can be made for the RTF vector for the LMA, the RTF for the XM must be estimated as the XM position is generally unknown. This paper investigates a procedure for estimating this unknown RTF by making use of the a priori RTF vector for the LMA, thereby completing the RTF vector for use of the MVDR beamformer. It is shown that such a procedure results in an Eigenvalue Decomposition (EVD) of a 2×2 matrix for a system of M microphones in the LMA and one XM. The resulting performance is evaluated within the context of a monaural MVDR beamformer.	beamforming;microphone;noise reduction	Randall Ali;Toon van Waterschoot;Marc Moonen	2018	2018 16th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)	10.1109/IWAENC.2018.8521368		Robotics	84.18945837248175	-35.684728534336074	30576

These filters preprocess speech signals between a microphone and a loudspeaker that radiates speech into a performance hall. Using our modulation filters, we conducted perceptual experiments with one hearingimpaired subject and two subjects with normal hearing.

a63101a09746b96e2235ebfd23b2a46afc274916	parametric electric guitar synthesis	parametric electric guitar synthesis	The electric guitar is one of the most common musical instruments today. Several synthesis algorithms have been created to synthesize its sound (Sullivan 1990; Karjalainen et al. 2006; Pakarinen, Puputti, and Välimäki 2008; Smith 2008). However, these previous synthesis models lack a few features that contribute to, or alter, the characteristic electric guitar tone. Firstly, the magnetic pickup used in electric guitars alters the sound radically. The magnetic pickup acts as a bandpass filter and causes a comb filter–like effect as a function of its position (Jungmann 1994). In addition, the response of the magnetic pickup has been found to be inharmonic, as are the vibrations of the string. Secondly, when using a distortion effect, the details of the attack and the sustain part of a tone are brought to an audible level, which is not the case with acoustic instruments. This is caused by the radically increased gain (0–120 dB) and the inherent compression of the distortion effect. Thirdly, the instrument can be played very expressively: The player has total control of the plucking event (plucking angle, force, and width) and can bend the string to alter the pitch. This article proposes a new parametric synthesis model that enables the creation of these sonic features. The synthesis model is based on the waveguide method (Jaffe and Smith 1983; Smith 1992; Karjalainen, Välimäki, and Tolonen 1998) with novel alterations. A new excitation model is introduced that recreates the plectrum scrape and the first displacement pulse created during the plucking event. The excitation model also accounts for different plucking forces, and the angle of the virtual plectrum is controllable.

In this paper a new stereo acoustic echo cancellation structure based on the Gabor expansion is presented, which allows one to get better performance than other classical solutions, both in terms of complexity and misalignment. In fact, the decorrelating and whitening capabilities of the Gabor expansion, recently proposed for monophonic echo cancellation, allow one to avoid the use of cross-filters and make the adaptive filtering in each sub-band more effective.	acoustic cryptanalysis;echo suppression and cancellation	L.

aa39a4b22122df2dfcc20bcce51e3b28df7a1044	hybrid electronic tongues applied to the quality control of wines		The legislation of food industry is becoming increasingly strict with regard to the quality of food products. Therefore, the market is demanding for automatic systems of analysis that allow fast and accurate monitoring of the evolution of quality parameters in agrofood products or permit obtaining information to optimize production processes. In this context, sensors andmore specifically microsensors play an important role since they allow fast and reproducible measurement of a large number of quality parameters with good reliability and can be implemented in portable systems. This paper presents a review of the results obtained with an electronic tongue based on different kinds of microsensors applied to wine analysis by the team of IMB-CNM. This multisensor system allows on one hand classifying the wine according to its features like grape variety, geographic origin, year, and organoleptic characteristics and on the other hand quantifying some parameters of interest in quality control, such as alcoholic degree, pH, ions, total acidity, glycerol, and color.	requirement;sensor;signal processing;throughput	Manuel Gutiérrez-Capitán;Fina Capdevila;Jordi Vila-Planas;Carme Domingo;Stephanus Büttgenbach;Andreu Llobera;Anna Puig-Pujol;Cecilia Jiménez-Jorquera	2014	J.

cf03dfbd92c4150343c93417d63546ee7b6e615b	study of the frequency-domain multichannel noise reduction problem with the householder transformation		This paper presents an approach to the multichannel noise reduction problem. It first transforms the multichannel noisy speech signals into the frequency domain. A Householder transformation is then constructed, which converts the multichannel coefficients in each frequency bin into two components: one dominated by speech and the other dominated by noise. A Wiener filter is subsequently formed to achieve an estimate of the noise in the speech dominated component from the noise dominated component. The enhanced speech is then obtained by subtracting the noise estimate from the speech dominated component. This approach consists of two critical steps: construction of the Householder transformation and formation of the noise reduction Wiener filter. If the source incidence angle is known a priori, the Householder transformation can be directly constructed using the steering vector and the optimal estimate of the signal of interest can then be obtained by applying the Wiener filter. If the source incidence angle is not known a priori, the Householder transformation can be constructed from a hypothesized incidence angle. Then, the optimal signal estimate is obtained by searching the maximum of the variance of the enhanced signal with the Wiener filter in the interested range of the incidence angle.	coefficient;householder transformation;incidence matrix;noise reduction;wiener filter	Gongping Huang;Jacob Benesty;Jingdong Chen	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7952203	mathematical optimization;bin;wiener filter;wiener deconvolution;frequency domain;noise reduction;noise measurement;householder transformation;reverberation;mathematics	Robotics	83.01563530777788	-34.68924060851413	34064

We first show that by adopting a linear activation function at the output layer and globally normalizing the target features into zero mean and unit variance, better performances can be obtained than existing DNN approaches. Then we show that the quality of dereverberated speech could be degraded with denser sampling in time for longer reverberation times, even at the price of increased computational complexities, requiring an adaptive time sampling strategy. On the other hand, the difference between the unwrapped phases of reverberant and anechoic speech becomes negligible with a dense sampling in frequency, implying a reduced speech distortion. Therefore, there is a great potential to enhance DNN based acoustic signal processing if the conventional sampling strategy can be carefully adjusted.	acoustic cryptanalysis;activation function;analysis of algorithms;artificial neural network;computation;deep learning;distortion;performance;sampling (signal processing);short-time fourier transform;signal processing	Bo Wu;Kehuang Li;Minglei Yang;Chin-Hui Lee	2016	2016 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA)	10.1109/APSIPA.2016.7820830	speech recognition;acoustics;engineering;communication	ML	83.93106906783501	-32.68476862614599	34330

Due to that, distortion artifacts (entrainment) are generated. In this paper, a sub-band feedback cancellation system is presented combined with an adaptation control to deal with those signals. Two control concepts for determining the variable step sizes [1, 2], known from general adaptive filter algorithms, are theoretically and practically analyzed and evaluated for an application to feedback cancellation. For feedback cancellation the control is combined with known methods to reduce the bias, such as prediction error filtering or frequency shifting. Based on this combination, a completely new setup for feedback cancellation is proposed. It relies entirely on signals accessible in real systems, shows a low computational complexity, and therefore has a strong practical relevance.	adaptive filter;algorithm;brainwave entrainment;computational complexity theory;distortion;feedback;heterodyne;relevance	Falco Strasser;Henning Puder	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6855201	speech recognition;computer science	Robotics	83.50320379652915	-33.225478210497734	34417

From the mineralogical point of view diamond is a metastable allotrope of carbon with face-centered cubic crystal structure. Diamonds are mostly found in natural deposits of igneous rocks known as kimberlites and la mproites, such as in Big Hole (Kimberley, South Africa), Mir (Mirny, Eastern Siberia, Russia) and Argyle (West Australia) [1]. Traditional usage of diamonds - as a precious stone - is actua l in the present and likely to continue being such in the future [2]. Since the end of the 19	algorithm;radiography	Dmitry P.

The present study investigates the capabilities of a small-aperture microphone array (SAMA) based system to identify the number and moving direction of vehicles travelling on a previously established route. In this paper, a SAMA-based acoustic monitoring system, including the system hardware architecture and algorithm mechanism, is designed as a single node sensor for the application of UGS. The algorithm is built on the varying trend of a vehicle's bearing angles around the closest point of approach (CPA). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method with our designed SAMA-based monitoring system in various experimental sites. The experimental results in harsh conditions validate the usefulness of our proposed UGS monitoring system.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;bands;coherence (physics);direction of arrival;drug vehicle;frequency band;kernel density estimation;microphone device component;motion estimation;node - plant part;non-small cell lung carcinoma;sensor web;zero suppression	Xingshui Zu;Shaojie Zhang;Feng Guo;Qin Zhao;Xin Zhang;Xing You;Huawei Liu;Baoqing Li;Xiaobing Yuan	2017		10.3390/s17051089	embedded system;electronic engineering;simulation;engineering	Robotics	85.26809975086556	-41.91571849089278	35889

Conventional depth-discrimination methods use a vertical line array, which has disadvantage of poor mobility due to the size of the sensor array. In this paper, we propose a depth-discrimination method for low-frequency sources using a horizontal line array (HLA) of acoustic vector sensors based on mode extraction. First, we establish linear equations related to the modal amplitudes based on modal beamforming in the vector mode space. Second, we solve the linear equations by introducing the total least square algorithm and estimate modal amplitudes. Third, we select the power percentage of the low-order modes as the decision metric and construct testing hypotheses based on the modal amplitude estimation. Compared with a scalar sensor, a vector sensor improves the depth discrimination, because the mode weights are more appropriate for doing so. The presented linear equations and the solution algorithm allow the method to maintain good performance even using a relatively short HLA. The constructed testing hypotheses are highly robust against mismatched environments. Note that the method is not appropriate for the winter typical sound speed waveguide, because the characteristics of the modes differ from those in downward-refracting sound speed waveguide. Robustness analysis and simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;beamforming;cordic;conceptualization (information science);conflict (psychology);estimated;extraction;least-squares analysis;less than;linear equation;mathematics-mechanization platform;max;medulloblastoma;microspectrophotometry;modal logic;natural science disciplines;offset binary;process-centered design;projections and predictions;protein array analysis;refresh rate;sessile serrated adenoma/polyp;simulation;velocity (software development);vertical bar;waveguide device component;weight;sensor (device)	Guolong Liang;Yifeng Zhang;Guangpu Zhang;Jia Feng;Ce Zheng	2018		10.3390/s18113692		EDA	85.7369007661976	-41.08866190130576	35938

Having a signal dependent transform has shown some advantages over the traditional signal independent transform. Recently, the single-channel noise reduction problem in the Karhunen-Loève expansion (KLE) domain has received special attention. In this paper, the noise reduction problem in the KLE domain is studied from a multichannel perspective. We present a new formulation of the problem, in which inter-channel and inter-mode correlations are optimally exploited. We derive different optimal noise reduction filters and present a set of useful performance measures within this framework. The performance of the different filters is then evaluated through experiments in which not only noise but also competing speech sources are present. It is shown that the proposed multichannel formulation is more robust to competing speech sources than the single-channel approach and that a better compromise between noise reduction and speech distortion can be obtained.	channel (communications);distortion;experiment;noise reduction	Yesenia Lacouture-Parodi;Emanuel A.

db0e88733c71b1d1d16ca7a680903518e5bf6ad2	a support vector regression-based method for target direction of arrival estimation from hf radar data		High-frequency (HF) radars have great potential for maritime surveillance, and the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm is usually used to estimate the direction of arrival (DOA) of targets for a wide-beam radar. However, the performance of the MUSIC algorithm relies on the precision of the antenna pattern, which could be contaminated by nearby electromagnetic interference. Therefore, the actual antenna pattern must be measured and used. In order to remove the requirement of antenna pattern measurement, a new method for target DOA estimation from wide-beam HF radar data using support vector regression (SVR) is proposed in this letter. A system model that relates target bearing and radar data feature is obtained through the SVR-based machine learning using the automatic identification system data and data associated with the vessels successfully detected by the HF radar. Then, such a model is used to determine the DOAs of targets from new data. The field experimental results at two sites demonstrate that the performance of the SVR method is better than that of the MUSIC algorithm.	algorithm;automatic identification and data capture;direction of arrival;distortion;feature selection;helicon filter;helicon focus;interference (communication);kernel density estimation;music (algorithm);machine learning;many antennas;mathematical optimization;radar;radiation pattern;support vector machine	Ruokun Wang;Biyang Wen;Weimin Huang	2018	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2018.2807405	support vector machine;mathematics;computer vision;artificial intelligence;radiation pattern;multiple signal classification;radar;electromagnetic interference;system model;bearing (mechanical);direction of arrival	Visualization	84.53210813274289	-42.3445326723143	37090
5063e43e1c03ed0a282fce84ed356cabc43b3b0f	multi-modal localization and enhancement of multiple sound sources from a micro aerial vehicle		The ego-noise generated by the motors and propellers of a micro aerial vehicle (MAV) masks the environmental sounds and considerably degrades the quality of the on-board sound recording. Sound enhancement approaches generally require knowledge of the direction of arrival of the target sound sources, which are difficult to estimate due to the low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) caused by the ego-noise and the interferences between multiple sources. To address this problem, we propose a multi-modal analysis approach that jointly exploits audio and video to enhance the sounds of multiple targets captured from an MAV equipped with a microphone array and a video camera. We first address audio-visual calibration via camera resectioning, audio-visual temporal alignment and geometrical alignment to jointly use the features in the audio and video streams, which are independently generated. The spatial information from the video is used to assist sound enhancement by tracking multiple potential sound sources with a particle filter. Then we infer the directions of arrival of the target sources from the video tracking results and extract the sound from the desired direction with a time-frequency spatial filter, which suppresses the ego-noise by exploiting its time-frequency sparsity. Experimental demonstration results with real outdoor data verify the robustness of the proposed multi-modal approach for multiple speakers in extremely low-SNR scenarios.	aerial photography;camera resectioning;direction of arrival;microphone;modal logic;on-board data handling;particle filter;signal-to-noise ratio;sparse matrix;streaming media;video tracking	Ricardo Sanchez-Matilla;Lin Wang;Andrea Cavallaro	2017		10.1145/3123266.3123412	spatial filter;camera resectioning;computer vision;streams;artificial intelligence;video tracking;microphone array;computer science;sound recording and reproduction;direction of arrival;video camera	Robotics	85.90298063637533	-39.658493366214415	37580

However SRP-PHAT can be computationally expensive, requiring a search of a large number of candidate locations. The required spacing between these locations is dependent on sampling rate, microphone array geometry, and source location. In this work, a novel method is presented that calculates a smaller number of test points using an efficient closed-form localization algorithm. This method significantly reduces the number of calculations, while still remaining robust in acoustical environments.	analysis of algorithms;hybrid algorithm;microphone;real-time clock;scsi rdma protocol;sampling (signal processing)	J.

The rationale of embedded optimization in performing online signal processing tasks, is to replace traditional adaptive filtering algorithms based on closed-form estimators by fast numerical algorithms solving constrained and potentially non-convex optimization problems. In the context of dereverberation, we adopt the embedded optimization paradigm to arrive at a joint estimation of the source signal of interest and the unknown room acoustics. It is shown how the inherently non-convex joint estimation problem can be smoothed by including regularization terms based on a statistical late reverberation model and a sparsity prior for the source signal spectrum. A performance evaluation for an example multi-microphone dereverberation scenario shows promising results, thus motivating future research in this direction.	adaptive filter;algorithm;convex optimization;design rationale;embedded system;estimation theory;mathematical optimization;matrix regularization;microphone;numerical analysis;performance evaluation;programming paradigm;signal processing;smoothing;sparse matrix;spectral density	Toon van Waterschoot;Bruno Defraene;Moritz Diehl;Marc Moonen	2013	21st European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO 2013)		mathematical optimization;speech recognition;machine learning;mathematics	EDA	83.33682835277365	-37.78155945230861	39039

As the focus of the Navy has shifted to the complex and volatile littoral environments characterized by high background interference, emphasis is given to the capability of advanced sensor technology to resolve left/right ambiguity in the direction of arrival and in broadband adaptation methods to enhance detection performance by incorporating in situ environmental information in the processing chain. This processing was used in a series of sea trials organized and executed by the Centre, a few of which included submarine targets.	beamforming;direction of arrival;interference (communication);sonar (symantec);signal processing;triplet state	Alberto Baldacci;Georgios Haralabus	2006	2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference		synthetic aperture sonar;electronic engineering;acoustics;telecommunications;engineering;beamforming;sensor array	Robotics	86.6563909959609	-45.11202193552944	40902

In the present work, we make use of sound localization technology using a microphone array, not only for localizing, but also for detecting sound intervals of multiple sound sources. In our previous work we have implemented and evaluated sound localization in the 3D-space using the MUSIC (MUltiple SIgnal Classification) method. In the present work, we proposed a method for detecting sound intervals based on the sound directivity information inferred from the dynamics of the MUSIC spectrogram. The proposed method achieved high sound interval detection accuracies and low insertion rates compared with the previous sound localization results.	acoustic cryptanalysis;acoustic model;algorithm;embedded system;humanoid robot;interval arithmetic;microphone;sensor;spectrogram;speech recognition	Carlos Toshinori Ishi;Liang Dong;Hiroshi Ishiguro;Norihiro Hagita	2010	2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2010.5652016	speech recognition;acoustics;sound localization;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;multiple signal classification;directional sound;spectrogram;music	Robotics	86.24655960501875	-35.912394277409184	41837

To their collective horror, record labels found that many of the original master recordings had deteriorated. Often the only existing copy of a recording was a vinyl pressing. This rush to release beloved music in the new digital form spawned intense interest in digital methods of restoring these old recordings. A number of DSP techniques have been developed to give new life to these recordings. This paper is a survey of some of those methods.	circuit restoration;the sims	James Anderson Moorer	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing	10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379940	multidimensional signal processing;sub-band coding;linear predictive coding;speech recognition;digital audio;audio signal processing;digital signal;computer science;digital signal processing;speech coding;signal processing;wiener filter;audio signal flow;statistics;signal	Robotics	84.55016435328677	-31.205156622568975	42209

Foster and Chou (2014) reviewed published studies that used computer models of radio-frequency electromagnetic fields to estimate and compare the tissue dose rate in the heads of children and adults using mobile phones. Their review confuses exposure with absorption, and the study results conclude erroneously that children are not more exposed than adults. We show that their review was not executed systematically. There are discrepancies between text summaries and the graphed ratios of child: adult peak special specific absorption rate, in line with the author's hypothesis that children have the same or lower tissue dose than adults. Even the underlying precept of their review is flawed, as the results of deterministic models are treated as random variables. In fact, model results are entirely determined by the underlying assumptions and the structure of the model. Models are included in their unsystematic review that do not consider differences in dielectric constants among different tissues, or across ages, while other models that consider such differences are not included. In this paper, we discuss the differences between exposure and tissue absorption and re-examine the results presented by Foster and Chou. Based upon our review, we suggest an alternative interpretation of the published literature. In an Appendix, we discuss modeling of tissue dose in the context of governmental safety certification processes.	automatic summarization;computer simulation;mobile phone;radio frequency;resultant	Robert D.

In the field of radar applications the principle of a cognitive system has been intensively studied over the past years. However, cognitive sonar systems draw only little attention in the reseach community. In this paper we are showing a new approach for a cognitive sonar system, that is able to adapt its signal processing to measured parameters of particular targets. This is possible by the fusion of the information of different data layers. Data resulting from an internal tracking module is used to adapt the signal processing at sensor layer. This is done by adjusting the transmit signal and the direction of the transmitted energy via transmit beamforming. These adjustments improve, on the one hand, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the signal-to-reverberation ratio (SRR) of the target through the adaption of the transmitted signal, and, on the other hand, extend the spatial awareness by adapting the transmit beamformer, which results in a combination of two spatial filters: the receive beampattern and the transmit beampattern.	artificial intelligence;beamforming;cognition;fm broadcasting;layer (electronics);radar;real life;real-time clock;real-time transcription;simpl;sonar (symantec);signal processing;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spatial–temporal reasoning	Tim Claussen;Viet Duc Nguyen	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Integration for Intelligent Systems (MFI)	10.1109/MFI.2015.7295834	pulse compression;electronic engineering;speech recognition;engineering;communication;beamforming;sensor array;signal	Robotics	85.57312943765338	-41.65858512454093	43206

With this aim in mind, the modulus of FrFT spectral bands are processed by the continuous Mexican Hat family of wavelets, being denoted by MEXH-CWTMOFrFT. Four modulus sets are obtained for the parameter a of the FrFT going from 0.6 up to 0.9 in order to compare their effects upon the spectral and quantitative resolutions. Four linear regression plots for each substance were obtained by measuring the MEXH-CWT-MOFrFT amplitudes in the application of the MEXH family to the modulus of the FrFT. This new combined powerful tool is validated by analyzing the artificial samples of the related drugs, and it is applied to the quality control of the commercial veterinary samples.	complex wavelet transform;continuous wavelet;fractional fourier transform;mexican hat wavelet;modulus of continuity;modulus robot	Erdal Dinç;Fernando B.

The method is capable of accurately distinguishing between open and closed lip states through the use of a low complexity detection algorithm, and is highly robust to interfering audible noise. A novel voice activity detector is implemented and evaluated using the proposed method and shown to detect voice activity with high accuracy, even in the presence of high levels of background noise. The lip state detector is evaluated at a number of angles of incidence to the mouth and under various conditions of background noise. The underlying mouth state detection technique relies upon an inaudible low frequency ultrasonic excitation, generated in front of the face of a user, either reflecting back from their face as a simple echo in the closed mouth state or resonating inside the open mouth and vocal tract, affecting the spectral response of the reflected wave when the mouth is open. The difference between echo and resonance behaviours is used as the basis for automated lip opening detection, which implies determining whether the mouth is open or closed at the lips. Apart from this, potential applications include use in voice generation prosthesis for speech impaired patients, or as a hands-free control for electrolarynx and similar rehabilitation devices. It is also applicable to silent speech interfaces and may have use for speech authentication.	acoustic cryptanalysis;activity tracker;airborne ranger;algorithm;authentication;chirp;computer engineering;diffuse reflection;experiment;filter design;frequency band;incidence matrix;lossless compression;matlab;modality (human–computer interaction);network interface device;resonance;sensor;silent speech interface;simulation;smartphone;smoothing;software propagation;speech recognition;speech synthesis;timit;tract (literature);transverse wave;voice activity detection	Ian Vince McLoughlin;Yan Song	2015	CSSP	10.1007/s00034-014-9904-4	voice activity detection;speech recognition;computer science;engineering	Mobile	84.94254715514803	-39.482961895771155	44317

During the whole process of FEA, mesh model generation plays a key role, which directly influences the accuracy and speed of FEA. In order to generate high quality mesh, a number of topology-based mesh optimization methods have been proposed and applied. However, they are all quite time consuming. In this paper, we propose a SVM-based approach to topological optimization of tetrahedral meshes, aiming to improve the efficiency of topological mesh optimization by using machine learning technique. First, the methodology of the SVM-based topological mesh optimization is put forward. Then the specific features for three kinds of flip operations for tetrahedral meshes are identified and the corresponding SVM models are further set up. Finally three SVM-based flip operations are implemented and the approach is verified and analyzed. The experiment result shows the SVM-based mesh optimization method can improve the mesh optimization efficiency without losing mesh quality.	display resolution;edge contraction;federal enterprise architecture;finite element method;hexahedron;machine learning;mathematical optimization;polygon mesh;smoothing;support vector machine;time complexity	Xiaoshen Chen;Dewen Peng;Shuming Gao	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-33573-0_13	support vector machine;finite element method;polygon mesh;computer science;topology;tetrahedron	Visualization	84.42841140243699	-24.545887402779844	44790

The model estimates contributions to sensor data from evoked sources, interference sources and sensor noise using Bayesian methods and by exploiting knowledge about their timing and spatial covariance properties. Full posterior distributions are computed rather than just the MAP estimates. In simulation, the algorithm can accurately localize and estimate the time courses of several simultaneously active dipoles, with rotating or fixed orientation, at noise levels typical for averaged MEG data. The algorithm even performs reasonably at noise levels typical of an average of just a few trials. The algorithm is superior to beamforming techniques, which we show to be an approximation to our graphical model, in estimation of temporally correlated sources. Success of this algorithm using MEG data for localizing bilateral auditory cortex, low-SNR somatosensory activations, and for localizing an epileptic spike source are also demonstrated.	approximation;beamforming;bilateral filter;cerebral cortex;electroencephalography;epilepsy;estimated;graphical model;image noise;interference (communication);magnetoencephalography;propylene glycol;randomized algorithm;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;statistical model;zero suppression	Johanna M.

In this paper an indirect method is introduced that allows estimation of this unknown current time course using only spike train data. Assuming the leaky integrator model as valid for the action potential encoding site of the investigated neuron, the unknown input current is obtained by determining (analytically) a current time course that upon injection into the leaky integrator model evokes action potential sequences identical to those observed experimentally. Applications of this current-reconstruction procedure to neuronal output data obtained from a leaky integrator model showed that the procedure allows a good estimation of the underlying input current even if the membrane time constant of the investigated neuron is not known exactly. Additionally, an application of current reconstruction to experimental data obtained from a cat muscle spindle primary afferent subject to repeated γ-stimuli is demonstrated.

The canceller is developed by modifying and optimizing an existing multirate filter bank that is used to improve the performance of a conventional full-band adaptive filtering. The proposed system is aimed to overcome problems of slow asymptotic convergence and high residual noise incorporating with the use of oversampled filter banks for acoustic noise cancellation applications. Analysis and synthesis filters are optimized for minimum amplitude distortion. The proposed scheme offers a simplified structure that without employing cross adaptive filters or stop band filters reduces the effect of coloured components near the band edges in the frequency response of the analysis filters. Issues of increasing convergence speed and decreasing the residual noise at the system output are addressed. Performance under white and coloured environments is evaluated in terms of mean square error MSE performance. Fast initial convergence was obtained with this modification. Also a decrease in the amount of residual noise by approximately 10dB compared to an equivalent subband model without modification was reachable under actual speech and background noise.	acoustic cryptanalysis;adaptive filter;automation;digital signal processor;distortion;filter bank;frequency response;informatics;input/output;mean squared error;oversampling;performance evaluation;robotics	Ali O.

We evaluated various sets of expansion coefficients up to 7000 to approximate and reconstruct DEMs with and without the Fejer summation. Digital models of horizontal and vertical curvatures were computed using the first and second partial derivatives of elevation derived from the reconstructed DEMs. To evaluate the approximation accuracy, digital models of residuals differences between the reconstructed DEMs and the initial one were calculated. The test results demonstrated that the method is characterized by a good performance i.e., a distinct monotonic convergence of the approximation and a high speed of data processing. The method can become an effective alternative to common techniques of DEM processing.	digital elevation model	Igor V. Florinsky;A. N.

In this paper, a novel adaptive filtering algorithm and an integrated system for acoustic echo and noise cancellation are presented. The proposed system includes adaptive noise cancellation, line enhancer, and echo cancellation which are based on a variable step-size affine-projection algorithm (VSS APA). The proposed VSS APA filtering algorithm is a combination of a variable step-size least-mean-square (VSS LMS) and an affine-projection algorithm (APA). The matrix of the APA allows more accurate, thorough input data and transforms the data into the structure of orthogonality, thus making the estimate of the weight vector faster and more accurate. To understand and verify the effectiveness of the proposed system, performance evaluation and comparison were conducted to compare the proposed algorithm and various traditional adaptive filtering algorithms in this application. The results demonstrated that the VSS APA has an effective performance and convergence in sound quality improvement of hands-free communication systems.	algorithm	Jian-da Wu;Shih-Lin Lin	2010	IJWMIP	10.1142/S0219691310003821	speech recognition;computer science;signal processing;sound quality;mathematics;statistics	EDA	84.67512860535906	-32.23594472111566	47303

Solutions vary according to scenario, application, and available resources. As the distance between the firing position and the sensor array increases, as in a typical sniper scenario, signal to noise ratio decreases and the estimation degrades. This paper proposes a gunshot DoA estimation algorithm to be used with highly noisy signals. We combine exhaustive search for selecting pairs of microphones from the array to attain the best DOA estimation results and fast response time for different shooting scenarios. We are particularly interested in highly corrupted signals for which state-of-the-art algorithms fail. Experimental results from simulated and recorded gunshot signals were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme.	algorithm;brute-force search;decibel;direction of arrival;microphone;response time (technology);scsi rdma protocol;signal-to-noise ratio	Angelo M.

In this contribution, we propose a nested generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC) beamforming structure, comprising an inner and an outer GSC beamformers (BFs), that decouple the speech dereverberation and the noise reduction operations. The BFs are implemented in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain. Two alternative reverberation models are adopted. In the first, used in the inner GSC, reverberation is assumed to comprise a coherent early component and a late reverberant component. In the second, used in the outer GSC, the influence of the entire acoustic transfer function (ATF) is modeled as a convolution along the frame index in each frequency. Unlike other BF designs for this problem that must be updated in each time-frame, the proposed BF is time-invariant in static scenarios. Experiments with both simulated and recorded environments verify the effectiveness of the proposed structure.	acoustic cryptanalysis;beamforming;brainfuck;coherence (physics);convolution;gsc bus;noise reduction;short-time fourier transform;time-invariant system;transfer function	Ofer Schwartz;Sharon Gannot;Emanuel A.

A novel experimentation and analysis technique has been developed to enable detailed investigation of robot interactions with granular soil. This technique, the Shear Interface Imaging Analysis method, provides visualization and analysis capability of soil shearing and flow as it is influenced by a wheel or excavation tool. The method places a half-width implement (wheel, excavation bucket, etc.) of symmetrical design in granular soil up against a transparent glass sidewall. During controlled motion of the implement, high-speed images are taken of the sub-surface soil, and are processed via optical flow software. The resulting soil displacement field is of very high fidelity and can be used for various analysis types. Identification of clusters of soil motion, shear interfaces and shearing direction/magnitude allow for analysis of the soil mechanics governing traction. The Shear Interface Imaging Analysis Tool enables analysis of robot-soil interactions in richer detail than possible before. Prior state-of-art technique relied on longexposure images that provided only qualitative insight, while the new processing technique identifies sub-millimeter gradations in motion and can do so even for high frequency changes in motion. Results are presented for various wheel types and locomotion modes: small/large diameter, rigid/compliant rim, grouser implementation, and push-roll locomotion.	bucket sort;displacement mapping;experiment;interaction;optical flow;robot;traction teampage	Scott Moreland;Krzysztof Skonieczny;David Wettergreen	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-40686-7_30	traction;simulation;computer science;robotics	Visualization	86.63297882485861	-24.715510433771	48840

The method results in improved signal-to-noise ratio of the processed signals and reduced ripple artifacts around the signal transients, thus preserving the true waveform in diagnostically important signal segments.

Hence, it leads to a new model that enables estimation of the pairwise distances by optimizing over the distances best matching the GCC-PHAT observations. Furthermore, the relation of this model to the coherence function is elaborated along with the dependency on the signal bandwidth. The experiments conducted on real data recordings demonstrate the theories and support the effectiveness of the proposed method.	bandwidth (signal processing);cross-correlation;experiment;microphone;theory	José F.

These approaches can achieve excellent performance in anechoic conditions but degrade rapidly in realistic environments where room reverberation corrupts localization cues. In this paper, we propose to integrate monaural and binaural processing to achieve segregation and localization of voiced speech in reverberant environments. The proposed approach builds on monaural analysis for simultaneous organization, and combines it with a novel method for generation of location-based cues in a probabilistic framework that jointly achieves localization and sequential organization. We compare localization performance to two existing methods, sequential organization performance to a model-based system that uses only monaural cues, and segregation performance to an exclusively binaural system. Results suggest that the proposed framework allows for improved source localization and robust segregation of voiced speech in environments with considerable reverberation.	binaural beats;internationalization and localization;location-based service	John Woodruff;DeLiang Wang	2010	IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing	10.1109/TASL.2010.2050087	image analysis;speech recognition;time–frequency analysis;acoustics;sound localization;reverberation;reverberation room;computer science;organization;speech;speech processing;computational auditory scene analysis;linguistics;probabilistic logic;robustness	Vision	86.23948833060466	-36.59751399160468	52853

In modern telecommunication applications, speech signals are often obtained inside office rooms, with one or more microphones placed at a distance from the talker. Such speech signals are affected by reverberation due to the reflections from surrounding walls and objects, which distort the observed speech signals and degrade the performance of speech processing algorithms. This paper presents a study of the identifiability of GCIs from reverberant speech using the Dynamic Programming Projected Phase-Slope Algorithm (DYPSA) and new extensions to the multimicrophone case. Two multichannel algorithms are proposed and evaluated; in both cases, considerable performance gains over a single microphone are obtained, with detection rates improved by up to 29% in highly reverberant environments.	algorithm;distortion;dynamic programming;microphone;reflection (computer graphics);speech processing	Mark R.

However, this method relies on a careful tuning of the different synthesis parameters, either estimated from a pre-recorded impulse response from the real acoustic scene, or set manually from experience. In this paper, we present a new method, which still inherits the efficiency of the FDN structure, but aims at linking the parameters of the FDN directly to the geometry setting. This relation is achieved by studying the sound energy exchange between each delay line using the acoustic radiance transfer method (RTM). Experimental results show that the late reverberation modeled by this method is in good agreement with the virtual geometry setting.	acoustic cryptanalysis;acoustic model;analog delay line;simulation;sound quality	Hequn Bai;Gaël Richard;Laurent Daudet	2015	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing	10.1109/TASLP.2015.2478116	speech recognition;acoustics;reverberation;room acoustics;computer science;speech;speech processing	EDA	86.9962900492323	-32.77665622069686	53304

An experimental test bed is developed to investigate the effect of width, height and slopes of the image of defocusing of the camera.

We show that the well-known adaptive blind multichannel identification algorithm employed for speech dereverberation suffers from misconvergence in the presence of bulk delays in the acoustic impulse responses. To address this, we propose to estimate the delay components using the allpass components of the received signals as well as pre-estimating the room impulse responses in the cepstrum domain. These pre-estimates are subsequently used for the initialization of the adaptive algorithm to achieve better impulse response estimates. Our proposed approach addresses the bulk delay problem and improves the convergence performance of the adaptive algorithm for blind system identification.	acoustic cryptanalysis;adaptive algorithm;all-pass filter;cepstrum;system identification;whole earth 'lectronic link	Rajan S.

e462c6f6af8326bbf7097fab0f178cbdf751bed1	lightweight and optimized sound source localization and tracking methods for open and closed microphone array configurations		Abstract Human–robot interaction in natural settings requires filtering out the different sources of sounds from the environment. Such ability usually involves the use of microphone arrays to localize, track and separate sound sources online. Multi-microphone signal processing techniques can improve robustness to noise but the processing cost increases with the number of microphones used, limiting response time and widespread use on different types of mobile robots. Since sound source localization methods are the most expensive in terms of computing resources as they involve scanning a large 3D space, minimizing the amount of computations required would facilitate their implementation and use on robots. The robot’s shape also brings constraints on the microphone array geometry and configurations. In addition, sound source localization methods usually return noisy features that need to be smoothed and filtered by tracking the sound sources. This paper presents a novel sound source localization method, called SRP-PHAT-HSDA, that scans space with coarse and fine resolution grids to reduce the number of memory lookups. A microphone directivity model is used to reduce the number of directions to scan and ignore non significant pairs of microphones. A configuration method is also introduced to automatically set parameters that are normally empirically tuned according to the shape of the microphone array. For sound source tracking, this paper presents a modified 3D Kalman (M3K) method capable of simultaneously tracking in 3D the directions of sound sources. Using a 16-microphone array and low cost hardware, results show that SRP-PHAT-HSDA and M3K perform at least as well as other sound source localization and tracking methods while using up to 4 and 30 times less computing resources respectively.	computation (action);covox speech thing;human–robot interaction;microphone device component;mobile robot;pleomorphic hyalinizing angiectatic tumor of soft parts;response time (technology);robot (device);signal processing;signal recognition particle ab:acnc:pt:ser/plas:qn;smoothing (statistical technique);source tracking	François Grondin;François Michaud	2018	CoRR		robustness (computer science);computer vision;filter (signal processing);source tracking;signal processing;artificial intelligence;microphone array;acoustic source localization;microphone;mobile robot;computer science	Robotics	86.14794926756356	-36.11488112791624	54121

Due to reverberation, BSS in the time domain is usually expensive in terms of computations. We propose in this paper a subband BSS system based on the use of adaptive feedback de-mixing networks in an oversampled uniform DFT filter bank structure. We show that the computational cost can be significantly decreased if BSS is carried out in subbands due to the possibility of reducing the sampling rate. Experiments with real speech signals, conducted with two-input two-output BSS systems using oversampled 32-subband and fullband adaptation, indicate that separation quality and distortion are similar for both systems. However, the proposed subband system is more than 10 times computationally faster than the fullband one.

Noise signals affect the transmitted signals during transmission. Every signal that we acquire at the receiver end of any communication system is somehow affected by noise. Noise is the unwanted part of the signal. Signals can be of various types in communication systems depending upon the requirement of the system, like signals carrying information during transmission of voice or speech or image or video. Each of these signals get affected during transmission. So for de-noising of these signals of deferent types we need different noise cancellation mechanism. In this paper we have adopted a noise cancellation mechanism for signals carrying information in voice communication. In voice communication the recorded speech data signal transmitted will be useless until and unless proper noise cancellation mechanism is adopted at the receiver end. There are so many mechanisms for such noise cancellation. A lot of research work is going on to find a complete solution to this problem. In this paper, we have adopted a new adaptive noise cancellation algorithm. This algorithm, we have proposed is based on mean power calculation of the speech signal. The average power of each speech frame is calculated. Then those frames are accepted which exhibits average power above certain threshold level.	algorithm;image noise;noise (signal processing);video	Arnab Pramanik;Rajorshee Raha	2012	2012 Ninth International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks (WOCN)	10.1109/WOCN.2012.6331907	voice activity detection;gaussian noise;effective input noise temperature;noise;g.729;speech recognition;colors of noise;computer science;noise measurement;noise;multiplicative noise;speech processing;noise figure;noise floor;carrier-to-receiver noise density	Mobile	83.49590545475677	-33.004099098884694	55062

We show that in situations where a target of interest is near to the listener while interfering sources are more distant, simple features that capture the directionality of sound energy can be used to attenuate significant undesired signal energy and can be more effective than a strategy based on noise-floor tracking.	beamforming;direction of arrival;noise floor;simple features;speech enhancement;zero suppression	John Woodruff;DeLiang Wang	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2011.5946399	speech recognition;coherence;computer science;speech;directional sound;machine learning;linear filter;mathematical model;supervised learning;signal-to-noise ratio;direction of arrival;statistics	Robotics	84.28962172702525	-34.14640656160852	55334
b06e2733f4762bbe316ad9d866b8926a57c4d0ed	human target localization algorithm using energy operator and doppler processing		In this letter, a localization algorithm, which combines energy operator with Doppler processing, is proposed for Doppler radar human sensing applications. For this algorithm, the energy operator is first used to extract the target components of interest from radar echoes and estimate their instantaneous frequencies (IFs). Then, on the basis of the IF estimation result, Doppler processing is applied to synthesize the target movement trajectories. Compared with the traditional localization methods, the proposed algorithm can more precisely estimate the target movement trajectory. Besides, it can further avoid the frequency ambiguity issue, and thus can be very promising for multitarget sensing applications. Experimental results are shown to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.	algorithm;direction of arrival;discrete system;energy operator;noise power;noise reduction;preprocessor;radar;real-time clock;sampling (signal processing)	Xiaoyi Lin;Yipeng Ding;Xuemei Xu;Kehui Sun	2018	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2018.2798926	mathematics;artificial intelligence;computer vision;ambiguity;doppler effect;time–frequency analysis;radar;trajectory;algorithm;doppler radar;energy operator	Robotics	85.528106828467	-39.40294156257943	55897

We fully exploit the direct path propagation model and our contribution is threefold: we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a set of time delays to correspond to a sound source position, a proof of the uniqueness of this position, and a localization mapping to retrieve it. The time delay estimation task is casted into a non-linear multivariate optimization problem constrained by necessary and sufficient conditions on time delays. Two global optimization techniques to estimate time delays and localize the sound source are investigated. We report an extensive set of experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods on simulated and real data in the presence of noise and reverberations.	broadcast delay;covox speech thing;experiment;global optimization;mathematical optimization;microphone;nonlinear system;optimization problem;software propagation	Xavier Alameda-Pineda;Radu Horaud;Bernard Mourrain	2013	2013 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics	10.1109/WASPAA.2013.6701849	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;acoustics;mathematics;acoustic source localization	Robotics	85.6031004704558	-36.45664849584316	57202

In particular, when the length of impulse response is long, performance is highly limited. In this paper, we show it is useless to be constrained by the condition, P T , where T is the frame size of FFT and P is the length of room impulse response. From our experiments, a frame size of 256 or 512 (32 or 64 ms at a sampling frequency of 8 kHz) is best even for the long room reverberation of TR = 150 and 300 ms. We also clari ed the reason for poor performance of BSS in long reverberant environment, nding that separation is achieved chie y for the sound from the direction of jammer because BSS cannot calculate the inverse of the room transfer function both for the target and jammer signals.	acoustic cryptanalysis;blind signal separation;experiment;fast fourier transform;sampling (signal processing);source separation;transfer function	Shoko Araki;Shoji Makino;Tsuyoki Nishikawa;Hiroshi Saruwatari	2001		10.1109/ICASSP.2001.940212	speech recognition;computer science;speech processing;mathematics;blind signal separation;transfer function;frequency domain	PL	84.90102550436028	-34.568218203501104	57447
e81e74b74ff950aa4f9631966c040bd3e13ea89b	robust constrained mfmvdr filtering for single-microphone speech enhancement		The multi-frame minimum variance distortionless response (MFMVDR) filter for single-microphone speech enhancement exploits speech correlation across consecutive time frames. This filter is designed to avoid speech distortion while minimizing the total signal output power. The MFMVDR filter is very sensitive to estimation errors in the speech correlation vector, since correlated speech components may be mistakenly suppressed. Inspired by robust beamforming approaches, in this paper we propose a robust constrained MFMVDR filter for single-microphone speech enhancement by estimating the speech correlation vector that maximizes the total signal output power within a spherical uncertainty set. For the upper bound of the spherical uncertainty set, we propose to use a trained mapping function that depends on the a-priori SNR. Experimental results for different noise types and SNRs show that the proposed robust approach achieves a more accurate estimate of the speech correlation vector resulting in low speech and noise distortion but a more conservative noise reduction.	beamforming;distortion;microphone;noise reduction;signal-to-noise ratio;speech enhancement	Dörte Fischer;Simon Doclo	2018	2018 16th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)	10.1109/IWAENC.2018.8521308	algorithm;filter (signal processing);noise measurement;noise reduction;speech enhancement;distortion;beamforming;microphone;signal-to-noise ratio;computer science	ML	84.0171185962984	-34.41089414351905	57685
a1e7a6976e286ad1cbd92938ebd6b72336eeeb70	beamforming array technique with clustered multichannel noise covariance matrix for mechanical noise reduction		In this paper, we propose a novel multichannel noise reduction method for a mechanical noise with a time-variant impulse response. The mechanical noise source location moves depending on the status of the actuator. In accordance with the move of the noise-source location, a most suitable multichannel beamformer is selected separately at each time-frequency bin. Each multichannel beamformer is made from a corresponding multichannel noise co-variance matrix which is learned in advance. The selection criteria in the proposed method is to minimize the residual noise power in the output signal. The multichannel beamformer that minimizes the residual power after beamforming is selected. Furthermore, to reduce directional noise sources, the multichannel directional noise covariance matrix is inserted into each multichannel mechanical noise covariance matrix. Experimental results of mechanical noise reduction show that the proposed method can reduce the mechanical noise more accurately than the conventional method.	beamforming;cluster analysis;digital camera;k-means clustering;noise generator;noise power;noise reduction;signal-to-noise ratio	Masahito Togami;Takashi Sumiyoshi;Yasunari Obuchi;Yohei Kawaguchi;Hiroaki Kokubo	2010	2010 18th European Signal Processing Conference		gradient noise;gaussian noise;image noise;noise;electronic engineering;speech recognition;acoustics;value noise;noise temperature;engineering;noise measurement;noise;noise;noise figure;noise floor;noise;salt-and-pepper noise	Robotics	84.10611109389504	-38.18040360612843	57903

SRP-Phat is probably the most popular direct method. It is based on computation of the generalized cross- correlation (GCC) of signals on a grid of preselected points. Anyway, in the presence of reverberation, the functional employed by SRP-Phat can be very irregular from point to point, thus making the source localization a difficult task. In this paper, a new functional is presented that regularizes the SRP- Phat approach and makes it more efficient the use of optimization algorithms to further refine the source position estimation. After a brief introduction, the proposed approach is described and compared to SRP-Phat on simulated and real data at different reverberation levels.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;computation;direct method in the calculus of variations;mathematical optimization;microphone;scsi rdma protocol;sampling (signal processing)	Albenzio Cirillo;Raffaele Parisi;Aurelio Uncini	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517602	direct method;speech recognition;reverberation;point-to-point	Robotics	85.56739808022876	-36.41785055050888	57964

Two typical scenarios are considered; that is, the received data are assumed to be uniformly sampled, i.e., without data missing for the first case and data are randomly missed for the second case. The main objective of this work is to explore the signal sparsity in the frequency domain to perform frequency estimation under the impulsive noise. Therefore, to that end, a DFT-like matrix is created in which the frequency sparsity is provided. The missing measurements are modeled by a sparse representation as well, where missing samples are set to be zeros. Based on this model, the missing pattern represented by a vector is indeed sparse since it only contains zeros and ones. The impulsive noise is remodeled as a superposition of a unknown sparse vector and a Gaussian vector because of the impulsive nature of noise. By utilizing the sparse property of the vector, the impulsive noise can be treated as a unknown parameter and hence it can be canceled efficiently. By exploring the sparsity obtained, therefore, a joint estimation method is devised under optimization framework. It renders one to simultaneously estimate the frequency, noise, and the missing pattern. Numerical studies and an application to speech denoising indicate that the joint estimation method always offers precise and consistent performance when compared to the non-joint estimation approach.	sparse matrix;spectral density estimation;zero suppression	Hongqing Liu;Yong Li;Yi Zhou;Hsin-Chiu Chang;Trieu-Kien Truong	2016	Digital Signal Processing	10.1016/j.dsp.2016.06.012	machine learning;pattern recognition;mathematics;sparsity-of-effects principle;statistics	ML	83.3249725273596	-36.63165110043928	58026
50a8e0a2a461ea14e7462a21ec304a2bee5cf6aa	cocktails, but no party: multipath-enabled private audio		We describe a private audio messaging system that uses echoes to unscramble messages at a few predetermined locations in a room. The system works by splitting the audio into short chunks and emitting them from different loudspeakers. The chunks are filtered so that as they echo around the room, they sum to noise everywhere except at a few chosen focusing spots where they exactly reproduce the intended messages. Unlike in the case of standard personal audio zones, the proposed method renders sound outside the focusing spots unintelligible. Our method essentially depends on echoes: the room acts as a mixing system such that at given points we get the desired output. Finally, we only require a modest number of loudspeakers and only a few impulse response measurements at points where the messages should be delivered. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method via objective quantitative metrics as well as informal listening experiments in a real room.	experiment;inter-process communication;loudspeaker;mixing (mathematics);multipath propagation;rendering (computer graphics);scrambler	Yu-Jeh Liu;Jonah Casebeer;Ivan Dokmanic	2018	2018 16th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)	10.1109/IWAENC.2018.8521292	multipath propagation;speech recognition;computer science;loudspeaker;impulse response;active listening;coherence (physics);intelligibility (communication);secure communication	AI	85.73907491351663	-34.6054566049001	58823

The array design is based on a minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) optimization criterion. MVDR beamformer weights are updated for each signal frame using an estimated spatio-spectral correlation matrix of the environmental noise field. We avoid matrix inversion by means of an iterative algorithm for weight vector computation. The beamformer performance is superior to designs based on an assumed homogeneous diffuse noise field. The new design also outperforms LMS-adaptive beamformers at the expense of a higher computational load. Additional noise reduction is achieved with the well-known beamformer/postfilter combination of the optimum multi-channel filter. An Ephraim-Malah spectral amplitude modification with minimum statistics noise estimation is employed as a postfilter. Experimental results are presented using sound recordings in a reverberant noisy room.	algorithm;beamforming;computation;fast fourier transform;filter bank;iterative method;mathematical optimization;microphone;noise reduction;whole earth 'lectronic link	Gerhard Doblinger	2006	2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference		electronic engineering;speech recognition;acoustics;adaptive beamformer;mathematics	EDA	84.05597691416857	-35.986155520952956	59880

Some sparseness based methods have already been proposed. However, most of these methods utilized a linear sensor array (or only two sensors), and therefore they have certain limitations; e.g., they cannot separate symmetrically positioned sources. To allow the use of more than three sensors that can be arranged in a non-linear/non-uniform way, we propose a new method that includes the normalization and clustering of the observation vectors. Our proposed method can handle both underdetermined case and (over-)determined cases. We show practical results for speech separation with non-linear/non-uniform sensor arrangements.

We compare four transform based noise reduction algorithms according to their influence on ASR performance. These include frequency domain based algorithms using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), the fast chirp transform (FCT), and the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), as well as a lattice filter based algorithm. Ten different types of noise with different characteristics are used, covering a broad range from almost stationary to highly non-stationary conditions. For single speakers, on average over the different noise types, a reduction of WER of up to 5.5% is possible. The DFT, DWT, and the lattice filter based algorithms lead to an improvement up to 2% relative WER on average over all speakers and noise types. Moreover, the application of the lattice filter based algorithm to recognition of noise-free data does not cause any degradation in the recognition performance. Hence the lattice filter based NR algorithm has a potential application in the real-life ASR systems.	algorithm;automated system recovery;chirp;discrete fourier transform;discrete wavelet transform;elegant degradation;international symposium on fundamentals of computation theory;lattice phase equaliser;noise reduction;real life;speech recognition;stationary process;word error rate	Erhard Rank;Amar Al-Khayat;Tuan Van Pham;Zsolt Saffer;Michael Stark	2010	2010 IEEE RIVF International Conference on Computing & Communication Technologies, Research, Innovation, and Vision for the Future (RIVF)	10.1109/RIVF.2010.5633588	electronic engineering;speech recognition;acoustics;mathematics	EDA	83.13104163089257	-33.42100565058236	60174

Distinguishing different objectives for heavy and light noise interference, two related algorithms are developed. For speech degraded by heavy noise, the improvement in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is as high as 12 dB; for lightly noisy speech, the improvement is modest and decreases as the SNR of the noisy speech increases. Quantizing noise is used to assess the capacity for reducing nonstationary noise using these algorithms; a significant reduction of such noise and an improvement in speech quality are achieved. The advantages of the proposed algorithms for speech enhancement include no need for prior knowledge of the noise and only a modest computational requirement. >	speech enhancement	Yan Ming Cheng;Douglas D.

We use phase models to study the dynamics of neurons and derive charge-balanced controls that achieve the minimum and maximum interspike times for a given bound on the control amplitude. Our derivation is valid for any arbitrary shape of the phase response curve and for any value of the given control amplitude bound. In addition, we characterize the change in the structures of the charge-balanced time-optimal controls with the allowable control amplitude. We demonstrate the applicability of the derived optimal control laws by applying them to mathematically ideal and experimentally observed neuron phase models, including the widely studied Hodgkin-Huxley phase model, and by verifying them with the corresponding original full state-space models. This work addresses a fundamental problem in the field of neural control and provides a theoretical investigation to the optimal control of oscillatory systems.	addresses (publication format);arabic numeral 0;derivation procedure;ephrin type-b receptor 1, human;experiment;hodgkin–huxley model;huxley: the dystopia;neuron;optimal control;oscillator device component;state space;tree accumulation;verification and validation;verifying specimen	Isuru Dasanayake;Jr-Shin Li	2014	Neural Computation	10.1162/NECO_a_00643	control theory;mathematics	ML	83.31618069911596	-26.229687919913964	61866

This method improves both localization and separation with a common configuration under various environments by iterative inference using Gibbs sampling. Experimental results from three environments of different reverberation times confirm that our method outperforms state-of-the-art sound source separation methods, especially in the reverberant environments, and shows localization performance comparable to that of the existing robot audition system.	covox speech thing;generative model;gibbs sampling;iterative method;robot;sampling (signal processing);source separation;topic model;unified framework	Takuma Otsuka;Katsuhiko Ishiguro;Hiroshi Sawada;Hiroshi G.

In the beamspace, the azimuth angle can be split from other parameters and can be estimated without using spectral peak search. Then, the elevation estimation can be obtained with the estimated azimuth angle via a one-dimensional spectrum peak search.

Earlier, in applications and in research the use of time delay estimation methods, such as the cross correlation, has been popular. Recently, techniques for direction estimation that involve sound intensity vectors have been developed and used in applications, e.g. in teleconferencing. Unlike in time delay estimation, these methods have not been compared widely. In this article, five methods for direction estimation in the concept of sound intensity vectors are compared with real data from a concert hall. The results of the comparison indicate that the methods that are based on convolutive mixture models perform slightly better than some of the simple averaging methods. The convolutive mixture model based methods are also more robust against additive noise.	academy;additive white gaussian noise;british undergraduate degree classification;broadcast delay;computer engineering;covox speech thing;cross-correlation;first-class function;microphone;mixture model;motion estimation;signal processing;utility functions on indivisible goods	Sakari Tervo	2009	2009 17th European Signal Processing Conference		electronic engineering;speech recognition;acoustics;mathematics	HPC	86.3457937267024	-37.126698199518344	64551

However, by increasing the number of sources, the complexity of the resulting power map increases, making it challenging to localize the separate sources. In this work, we propose an efficient 2D histogram processing approach which is applied on the local DOA estimates, provided by SRP, and reveals the DOA of multiple audio sources in an iterative fashion. Driven by the results, we also apply the same methodology to local DOA estimates of a known subspace method and improve its accuracy. The performance of the presented algorithms is validated with numerical simulations and real measurements with a rigid spherical microphone array in different acoustical conditions: for multiple audio sources with different angular separations, various reverberation and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values.	algorithm;angularjs;apache axis;beamforming;direction of arrival;iterative method;microphone;numerical analysis;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;v-optimal histograms	Symeon Delikaris-Manias;Despoina Pavlidi;Ville Pulkki;Athanasios Mouchtaris	2016	2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)	10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760493	electronic engineering;speech recognition;acoustics;mathematics	Vision	85.27968638732567	-36.63078634061399	64877
c7f82ec6bf816adf0166aba4b32244d69a7703a8	special issue on co-prime sampling and arrays		Co-prime sampling and co-prime arrays have recently been shown to improve active and passive sensing in radar and underwater acoustics using both narrowband and wideband signal platforms. Co-prime processing provides a systematical framework for sparse sampling and array configuration with increased aperture and improved spatial resolution. Co-prime based approaches to sampling and arrays can combat ambiguity and provide unique answers to target coordinates under forced coarse sampling in time, frequency, and space. Temporal and spatial co-prime samplings make advances in direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation, spectrum sensing, and sparse covariance sketching. They find broad applications in synthetic aperture radar (SAR), radio frequency (RF) surveillance, target localization, wideband urban radar processing, space–time adaptive processing, and nonstationary array processing utilizing Doppler signatures and instantaneous frequency source characteristics. The goal of the Special Issue is to publish the most recent results in signal processing using co-prime sampling and arrays. Review papers on this topic are also welcome.

We propose a generic framework for mixture signal analysis based on a latent variable approach. The basic idea of the approach is to detect known sources represented as stochastic models, in a single-channel mixture signal without performing signal separation. A given mixture signal is modeled as a convex combination of known source models and the weights of the models are estimated using the mixture signal. We show experimentally that these weights indicate the presence/absence of the respective sources. The performance of the proposed approach is illustrated through mixture speech data in a reverberant enclosure. For the task of identifying the constituent speakers using data from a single microphone, the proposed approach is able to identify the dominant source with up to 8 simultaneously active background sources in a room with RT60= 250 ms, using models obtained from clean speech data for a Source to Interference Ratio (SIR) greater than 2 dB.	computable function;expectation–maximization algorithm;experiment;interference (communication);latent variable;microphone;open-source software;resilient packet ring;sensor;signal processing;sparse matrix;stochastic process	Sundar Harshavardhan;Thippur V.

Various approaches to echo cancellation have been proposed and generally involve two separate stages, namely those of adaptive echo cancellation and, as is the focus here, residual echo suppression. Whilst computationally efficient, residual echo suppression approaches based on gain loss control have poor double talk performance. Sub-band approaches give better performance but generally introduce a significant signal delay. This paper reports new experimental work which assesses the performance of three low delay approaches to suppress residual echo through time domain convolution. Results show that a new approach, based on the inverse discrete Fourier transform, performs as well as the existing approaches for both linear and non-linear echo whilst maintaining computational efficiency and low signal delay.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithmic efficiency;computation;convolution;discrete fourier transform;echo suppression and cancellation;nonlinear system;while;zero suppression	Christelle Yemdji;Moctar Mossi Idrissa;Nicholas W.

The technique utilizes information regarding the locations of the speech source of interest and the microphones to compute a time varying filter that results in substantial noise reduction over other speech enhancement techniques such as delay-and-sum beamforming and superdirective beamforming. For example, digit recognition results in an environment with two speakers and a reverberation time of 0.1s show a recognition accuracy rate increase of 25.2% over delay-and-sum beamforming and an increase of 26.5% over superdirective beamforming using six microphones.	beamforming;experiment;microphone;noise reduction;proceedings of the ieee;speech enhancement;speech recognition	Calvin Yiu-Kit Lai;Parham Aarabi	2004	2004 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2004.1325965	computer vision;speech recognition;reverberation;computer science;noise reduction;robustness	Robotics	83.81164797208478	-33.934115833773596	66890
5400ba8a49e985ce6a5faab7b6393d3bcdae5357	speaker localization using direct path dominance test based on sound field directivity		Abstract Estimation of the direction-of-arrival (DoA) of a speaker in a room is important in many audio signal processing applications. Environments with reverberation that masks the DoA information are particularly challenging. Recently, a DoA estimation method that is robust to reverberation has been developed. This method identifies time-frequency bins dominated by the contribution from the direct path, which carries the correct DoA information. However, its implementation is computationally demanding as it requires frequency smoothing to overcome the effect of coherent early reflections and matrix decomposition to apply the direct-path dominance (DPD) test. In this work, a novel computationally-efficient alternative to the DPD test is proposed, based on the directivity measure for sensor arrays, which requires neither frequency smoothing nor matrix decomposition, and which has been reformulated for sound field directivity with spherical microphone arrays. The paper presents the proposed method and a comparison to previous methods under a range of reverberation and noise conditions. Result demonstrate that the proposed method shows comparable performance to the original method in terms of robustness to reverberation and noise, and is about four times more computationally efficient for the given experiment.

The signal estimated on filter output presents a total gain in the signal-to-noise ratio of about 10 dB.

In this paper, we present a multichannel algorithm, which utilizes the blind recordings of a spherical microphone array to estimate the DRR of interest. The algorithm is developed based on a spatial correlation model formulated in the spherical harmonics domain. This model expresses the cross correlation matrix of the recorded soundfield coefficients in terms of two spatial correlation matrices, one for direct sound and the other for reverberation. While the direct path arrives from the source, the reverberant path is considered to be a nondiffuse soundfield with varying directional gains. The direct and reverberant sound energies are estimated from the aforementioned spatial correlation model, which then leads to the DRR estimation. The practical feasibility of the proposed algorithm was evaluated using the speech corpus of the acoustic characterization of environments challenge. The experimental results revealed that the proposed method was able to effectively estimate the DRR of a large collection of reverberant speech recordings including various environmental noise types, room types and speakers.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;coefficient;cross-correlation;deficit round robin;microphone;speech corpus	Prasanga N.

Source localisation becomes a challenging problem in reverberant environments and under noisy conditions, leading to potentially poor performance in cocktail party scenarios. This paper evaluates the performance of a low-complexity localisation approach using spherical harmonics in reverberant environments for multiple speakers. Eigen-beams are used to estimate pseudo-intensity vectors pointing in the direction of sound intensity. This paper proposes a clustering approach in which the intensity vectors of active sound sources and strong reflections are extracted, yielding an estimate of the source direction in azimuth and inclination as an approach to source localisation.	cluster analysis;eigen (c++ library);image resolution;reflection (computer graphics);reflection mapping;speech acquisition	Christine Evers;Alastair H.

However, searching for the desired directions of the time-block sequence of an acoustic signal is time consuming, and existing deterministic methods rarely consider the motion properties of the acoustic source. In this paper, a dynamic source-direction prediction method for real-time blind convolutive mixtures based on a Kalman filter is proposed. First, the convolutive mixture signals captured by the coincident array geometry are formulated, and the relationship between source-direction and source separation is developed. Second, motion prediction based on a Kalman filter is theoretically analyzed, and the motion of a source is modeled as a noise-driven position integrator with enough samples. Then, a dynamic source-direction prediction method for real-time blind source separation based on a Kalman filter is proposed to predict the directions of a time sequential signal. Combined with the local direction searching method, our proposed method has a self-correction ability according to the three-sigma rule. Finally, extensive experiments are performed with three-source convolutive mixtures of speeches in English and Chinese, whose direction varies in linear and nonlinear motions. The signal-to-distortion and signal-to-interference of the separated signals are calculated, and the experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed method.

A new noise reduction algorithm based on a logarithmic microphone array and the multiresolution wavelet transform is described. The proposed processing is applied in the time-spectral domain with respect to the logarithmic subband decomposition of the spectrum of each microphone signal. The advantage of the proposed method is that both the sub-array based beamforming operation and the post ltering are performed in the same transform domain without adding FFT processing. Computer simulation results show that our approach is effective for noise reduction. The technique can be used in hands-free voice communication applications operating in an adverse environment.

Instead of considering the signal as a whole to estimate the TDOA, like classical methods do, we first detected the series of samples that look alike on each pair of hydrophones of the array by using cross-recurrence plot analysis. The TDOA is then estimated by relying only on these common sample series. The TDOA estimator is based on quantification measures specifically designed for CRPA. The proposed method is successfully validated on real data containing frequency-modulated sounds from beluga whales.	acoustic cryptanalysis;cross-correlation;modulation;multilateration;recurrence plot;waveform	Olivier Le Bot;Jérôme I.

It is based on a simple observation that turns time differences of arrival (TDOA) or time of arrival (TOA) measurements from the signals of a microphone array into a geometric constraint. The reflector localization methodology relies on accurate TDOA which is directly dependent on speed of sound information. Estimating the actual speed of sound at the ambient temperature therefore greatly improves the accuracy of the reflector localization in uncontrolled environments. This manuscript shows how to use the geometric inference jointly with the speed of sound estimation for a more accurate reflector localization. Simulations and experiments show the validity of the proposed approach.	acoustic cryptanalysis;computer simulation;experiment;microphone;multilateration;time of arrival;uncontrolled format string	Paolo Annibale;Jason Filos;Patrick A.

In this method, perceptually irrelevant frequencies are removed from the speech spectrum using block based perceptual masking (simultaneous frequency masking) and then independent component analysis is applied. After source separation in frequency domain, a physical property of the mixing matrix, i.e., the coherency in adjacent frequencies, is utilized to solve the permutation ambiguity. From the simulation results it appears that the perceptual masking avoids the permutation problem.	blind signal separation;independent component analysis;relevance;simulation;source separation;unsharp masking	Ram Mohana Reddy Guddeti;Bernard Mulgrew	2005	Proceedings.

We describe a new topological method to find the period of signals that have an almost periodic waveform. Proposed method is applied to signals received from a pyro-electric infrared sensor array for the online estimation of the respiratory rate (RR) of a person. Time-varying analog signals captured from the sensors exhibit an almost periodic behavior due to repetitive nature of breathing activity. Sensor signals are transformed into two-dimensional point clouds with a technique that allows preserving the period information. Features, which represent the harmonic structures in the sensor signals, are detected by applying persistent homology and the RR is estimated based on the persistence barcode of the first Betti number. Experiments have been carried out to show that our method makes reliable estimates of the RR.	almost periodic function;analog signal;barcode;betti number;homology (biology);homology modeling;online algorithm;persistence (computer science);persistent homology;point cloud;rapid refresh;round-robin scheduling;sensor;waveform	Fatih Erden;A.

More specifically, we propose to constrain the power of the MCLP-based late reverberation estimate with the late reverberant power estimated using the exponential decay model, thereby preventing excessive cancellation of the speech signal. Simulation results show that incorporating the constraint improves the performance of the adaptive dereverberation method when the prediction filters need to adapt quickly.	adaptive filter;algorithm;simulation;statistical model;time complexity	Ante Jukic;Zichao Wang;Toon van Waterschoot;Timo Gerkmann;Simon Doclo	2016	2016 IEEE International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)	10.1109/IWAENC.2016.7602922	speech recognition;acoustics;computer science;communication	Arch	83.50738953050126	-34.29421050590486	72079

Many microphones are generally needed to pick up all noise signals where some noise signals are simultaneously controlled in more spacious space. Therefore, the noise signals give correlations between reference signals and then the convergence speed of noise control filters becomes slow. The proposed system can remove the correlations by inserting a correlation removal filter between reference signals and consequently reduce the noise more quickly. Moreover, we use the frequency domain time difference simultaneous perturbation method (FDTDSP method) to update the noise control filters. Experimental results demonstrate that the ANC system using the perturbation method with a correlation removal filter is effective in the actual system.	control system;microphone;perturbation theory	T.

f7f004e462d59e8492aafe58ae0aab71c1c53c74	swarm intelligence based particle filter for alternating talker localization and tracking using microphone arrays	talker localization and tracking;journal article;microphone arrays	We address the problem of localizing and tracking alternating moving or stationary talkers using microphone arrays in a room environment. One of the main challenges is the frequent and possibly abrupt change of talker positions, which requires the algorithm to capture the active talker rapidly. In addition, the presence of interference, background noise, and room reverberation degrades the tracking performance. We propose a new algorithm that jointly exploits the advantages of the particle filter PF and particle swarm intelligence. The PF is used as a general tracking framework, which incorporates a proposed alternating source-dynamic model for recursive estimation of talker position. Unlike the conventional PF, where particles operate independently in the particle sampling stage, the use of swarm intelligence allows particles to interact with each other, thereby improving convergence toward the active talker location. In addition, the memory mechanism in swarm intelligence allows particles to remain at their previous best-fit state estimate when signals are corrupted by interference, noise, and/or reverberation. Simulations and experiments were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.		Kai Wu;Vaninirappuputhenpurayil Gopalan Reju;Andy W. H.

The algorithm has two stages, wherein the first stage consists of selecting a subset of the basis vectors iteratively via a regularized inverse of the point spread function, and the second stage consists of constructing point source solutions using this basis subset and its coefficients via hierarchical agglomerative clustering. We have evaluated the algorithm on both synthetic and real data, and show that the overall accuracy in terms of direction of arrival and reconstructed source power is better than four other state of the art methods.	acoustic cryptanalysis;basis (linear algebra);cluster analysis;coefficient;deconvolution;dhrystone;direction of arrival;greedy algorithm;hierarchical clustering;matching pursuit;sparse matrix	Trond F.

f0e27b11ccdeca5b26fa809f3b2a91d9ca38a9e7	vibration measurement with electrical speckle shearing pattern interferometry		Electrical speckle shearing pattern interferometry (ESSPI), being a kind of high-precision noncontact real-time measurement method in the whole field, has been used in the field of deformation measurement and harmonic vibration measurement deviating from rough object plane in the optical scale. The method can also be used in the field of nondestructive test (NDT). Two general methods, time-average methods and stroboscopic method, are studied to measure harmonic vibration deviating from object plane and corresponding mathematical models of electrical speckle shearing interfering stripes distribution are set up based on the theory of statistical optics. The vibration measuring system based on ESSPI is designed and the experiments are done to verify measurement availability of the above two methods. The experiment results with time-average method and those with stroboscopic method are compared to prove the following conclusions. The contrast of speckle stripes in electrical speckle shearing interfering stripe images with time-average method is decreased obviously with increase of the stripes level and therefore the time-average method is generally used in qualitative analysis of vibration. The speckle stripes quality in the electrical speckle shearing interfering stripe images with stroboscopic method is better than that with time-average method and the instant vibration distribution can be analyzed quantitatively with stroboscopic method too.	data striping;experiment;magnetic stripe card;mathematical model;real-time clock;stripes	Chao Jing;Zhongling Liu;Chunlei Guo;Yu Zhang;Yimo Zhang	2016	2016 International Conference on Identification, Information and Knowledge in the Internet of Things (IIKI)	10.1109/IIKI.2016.119	deformation (mechanics);computer network;nondestructive testing;shearing (physics);stroboscope;computer science;speckle pattern;interferometry;harmonic;vibration;optics	Robotics	89.42854364060625	-24.520698468793604	72996

The noise is difficult to be filtered, due to considerable overlapping of its frequency spectrum to the frequency spectrum of the ECG. Today, filters must conform to the new guidelines (2007) for low-pass filtering in ECG with cutoffs of 150 Hz for adolescents and adults, and to 250 Hz for children. We are suggesting a pseudo-real-time low-pass filter, self-adjustable to the frequency spectra of the ECG waves. The filter is based on the approximation procedure of Savitzky–Golay with dynamic change in the cutoff frequency. The filter is implemented pseudo-real-time (real-time with a certain delay). An additional option is the automatic on/off triggering, depending on the presence/absence of EMG noise. The analysis of the proposed filter shows that the low-frequency components of the ECG (low-power P- and T-waves, PQ-, ST- and TP-segments) are filtered with a cutoff of 14 Hz, the high-power P- and T-waves are filtered with a cutoff frequency in the range of 20–30 Hz, and the high-frequency QRS complexes are filtered with cutoff frequency of higher than 100 Hz. The suggested dynamic filter satisfies the conflicting requirements for a strong suppression of EMG noise and at the same time a maximal preservation of the ECG high-frequency components.	approximation;beckwith-wiedemann syndrome;binary golay code;biologic preservation;conflict (psychology);electrocardiography;electromyography;filter bank;frequency band;frequency response;galaxy morphological classification;hertz (hz);image noise;interval arithmetic;low-pass filter;low-power broadcasting;maximal set;pseudo brand of pseudoephedrine;real-time clock;requirement;spectral density;zero suppression	Ivaylo Christov;Tatyana Neycheva;Ramun Schmid;Todor Stoyanov;Roger Abächerli	2017	Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing	10.1007/s11517-017-1625-y	electronic engineering;acoustics;low-pass filter;telecommunications;mathematics;high-pass filter;center frequency	EDA	84.63653873073255	-40.119542879121916	74968

A novel subband feedback controller based on speech presence probability is applied to Generalized Sidelobe Canceller algorithm to obtain a more robust adaptive beamforming in adverse environment and alleviate the problem of signal cancellation. A multi-channel postfiltering is used not only to further suppress diffuse noises and some transient interferences, but also to give the speech presence probability information in each subband. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves considerable improvement on signal preservation of the desired speech in adverse noise environments, consisting of both directional and diffused noises over the comparative algorithms.	adaptive beamformer;algorithm;beamforming;control theory;speech enhancement	Kai Li;Qiang Fu;Yonghong Yan	2010			speech recognition;frequency domain;artificial intelligence;pattern recognition;speech enhancement;computer science;communication channel	Robotics	84.22994723510101	-34.0604676778595	75338

The proposed approach derives the interaural level difference (ILD) of observations from the two microphones for different target positions and stores the ILDs as database a priori. Given a new acoustic observation on a target, an acoustic observation likelihood is created by calculating the correlation of the ILD of the new observation to the stored ILDs. A joint observation likelihood is then developed by fusing the optical and acoustic observation likelihoods, and the recursive Bayesian estimation updates and maintains belief on the target using the joint observation likelihood. The proposed approach detects a target positively using an acoustic sensor even if it is outside the field of view of the optical sensor and localizes the target accurately by estimating it within the RBE. The efficacy of the proposed approach was first validated by experimental studies. Further numerical demonstrations then show the applicability of the proposed approach to the NFOV target estimation.	acoustic cryptanalysis;internet listing display;microphone;numerical analysis;recursion;sensor	Makoto Kumon;Daisuke Kimoto;Kuya Takami;Tomonari Furukawa	2013	2013 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2013.6696844	speech recognition;acoustics;engineering;statistics	Robotics	87.14179620021959	-37.61552991071665	75726

A simple signal-power-based method using a parabolic antenna has been proposed in the radar field. But the signal-power-based method is not effective for finding the direction of a talking person due to the varying power of the uttered speech signals. In this paper, the sound-source-direction estimation method focuses on the acoustic transfer function instead of the signal power. The use of the parabolic reflection board leads to a difference in the acoustic transfer functions of the target direction and the non-target directions, where the active microphone rotates and observes the speech at each angle. The acoustic transfer function is estimated from the observed speech using the statistics of clean speech signals. Its effectiveness is confirmed by monaural sound-source-direction estimation experiments in a room environment.	acoustic cryptanalysis;diffuse reflection;experiment;microphone;parabolic antenna;signal processing;transfer function	Ryoichi Takashima;Tetsuya Takiguchi;Yasuo Ariki	2009	2009 12th International Conference on Information Fusion		electronic engineering;speech recognition;acoustics;noise-canceling microphone;engineering	Robotics	86.04750618474307	-35.47517313506231	77686

The existing methods for source counting in underdetermined blind speech separation suffer from the overlapping between sources with low W-disjoint orthogonality. To address this issue, we propose to fit the direction-of-arrival (DOA) histogram with multiple von-Mises density (VM) functions directly and form a sparse recovery problem, where all the source clusters and the sidelobes in the DOA histogram are fitted with VM functions of different spatial parameters. We also developed a formula to perform the source counting taking advantage of the values of the sparse source vector to reduce the influence of sidelobes. Experiments are carried out to evaluate the proposed source counting method, and the results show that the proposed method outperforms two well-known baseline methods.	acoustic cryptanalysis;assumed;baseline (configuration management);compressed sensing;direction of arrival;histogram;seizures;sparse matrix;von willebrand disease	Yang Chen;Wenwu Wang;Zhe Wang;Bingyin Xia	2019	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2018.2879547		AI	83.39692289838499	-37.18064754419005	78654

In essence such pulse is transiently short in time domain and wide in frequency domain, and as such it is difficult to separate signal to noise based on Fourier Transform spectrum. So as to seek for detection methods of short pulse, minor differences of energy distribution of time-frequency characteristics are presented on three time-frequency methods such as Short Time Fourier Transform, Wavelet Transform and Hilbert-Huang Transform. With these results, a tri-channel detector is established for such underwater short pulse in noise environment, which is generally suitable not only for detection module of underwater sonar system but also that of radar system.	frequency analysis;hilbert–huang transform;image resolution;near field communication;quantum fluctuation;radar;real-time clock;real-time computing;sonar (symantec);sensor;short-time fourier transform;time–frequency analysis;triangular function;ultra-wideband;wavelet transform;yang	Yunlu Ni;Hang Chen	2013	JNW	10.4304/jnw.8.1.205-212	pulse compression;speech recognition;time–frequency analysis;telecommunications	Robotics	84.74533642817468	-39.56771816512685	79207

Various explosives and related compounds (ERC) in the mixture can be identified and the concentration of each component can be estimated based on the known spectral data of the pure explosive components. In this paper, the terahertz spectroscopic uncertainty analysis using a micro-GA has been proposed, in which the random assignment of alleles from parents to offspring is implied. An intelligent computation-based technical road-map is also provided for the analysis and optimisation of the terahertz spectroscopic combination analysis. A simulation with two given test cases for the ERC has been devised. The results of the simulation show that micro-GA and its derivatives have the potential applications in the fields of security, medicine and food industry to fast identify mixtures.	british informatics olympiad;coefficient of determination;genetic algorithm;real-time clock;real-time computing;simulation;software release life cycle;test case	Yi Chen;Yong Ma;Zheng Lu;Lixia Qiu;Jin He	2011	Advances in Engineering Software	10.1016/j.advengsoft.2011.04.011	econometrics;genetic algorithm;uncertainty analysis;computer science;engineering;terahertz radiation;forensic engineering;mixture;terahertz spectroscopy and technology	SE	84.74520550520003	-47.365939823475536	79479

The enhancement takes place in the subband domain with elementary PFs in each band. To efficiently handle complex noise situations, the noise spectrum is modelled in each band as a white Gaussian noise sequence with a time-varying gain. Two solutions are proposed to estimate these time-varying average subband noise levels: they are either drawn internally by the PFs, or they are obtained by external dedicated noise power spectral density estimation - both methods are found to yield very close results. Several subband decompositions are tested, and a robust way of incorporating perceptual constraining is introduced. The assembled PF-based architecture is then compared with state-of-the-art enhancement algorithms in various conditions, and is found to outperform them according to seven objective speech quality measures.	algorithm;cobham's thesis;microphone;noise power;particle filter;signal-to-noise ratio;singular value decomposition;spectral density estimation;speech enhancement	Frédéric Mustière;Miodrag Bolic;Martin Bouchard	2010	2010 2nd International Workshop on Cognitive Information Processing	10.1109/CIP.2010.5604235	gradient noise;gaussian noise;electronic engineering;speech recognition;acoustics;value noise;engineering;noise measurement	ML	83.26140737372745	-34.66767833059171	79489
d48fdf23934dffc79a194b83cbd493778cf83e03	multiple sound source tracking using low complexity directional estimation		In this paper, a method for sound source tracking by two microphones is studied. Then, it is often assumed to be implemented on DSP (Digital Signal Processor). In this case, it is required to reduce the calculation cost. In our method, a sequential updating histogram based on the instantaneous phase difference is used for estimating the sound source direction. Moreover, for attaining more tracking accuracy, the microphone width is expanded for enhancing a spatial resolution. Several experimental results in a real environment are shown to present the effectiveness of the our method.	covox speech thing;digital signal processor;instantaneous phase;microphone;source tracking	Kenta Omiya;Kenji Suyama	2017	2017 17th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)	10.1109/ISCIT.2017.8261210	digital signal processor;real-time computing;time–frequency analysis;source tracking;digital signal processing;computer science;image resolution;histogram;microphone;instantaneous phase	Arch	85.19355412580201	-37.68746713729478	79679

Near-field optical sensors were installed underneath the drumhead of a commercially available snare drum. By implementing a time difference of arrival (TDOA) algorithm, accuracy within 2cm was achieved in approximating the location of strikes.

To effectively suppress background noise, this model incorporates a perceptual filterbank and an auditory gain adaptation derived from a psychoacoustic model into a signal subspace approach. The projection approximation subspace tracking deflation (PASTd) algorithm is used to track the signal subspace. For real-time processing, a system-on-a-programmable-chip architecture and a very large scale integration design of the PASTd algorithm are proposed. To realize a pipeline computation, this paper presents a pipelined PASTd architecture without data-dependent hazards. The maximum clock rate is 9.7 MHz, and the typical clock rate, which achieves the real-time requirement, is 4.6 MHz. The corresponding architecture was experimentally verified via an ALTERA EPXA10 development board.	algorithm;approximation;clock rate;computation;data dependency;degradation (telecommunications);experiment;filter bank;integrated circuit;microprocessor development board;peripheral;pipeline (computing);prototype;psychoacoustics;rate of convergence;real-time clock;signal subspace;simulation;speech enhancement;speech processing;speech recognition;system on a chip;tree structure;very-large-scale integration;wavelet packet decomposition	Chung-Hsien Yang;Jia-Ching Wang;Jhing-Fa Wang;Chung-Hsien Wu;Kai-Hsing Chang	2008	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2007.912158	system on a chip;embedded system;electronic engineering;speech recognition;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;signal processing;speech processing;very-large-scale integration	Robotics	83.63282048444913	-32.22926905442307	80405

We develop a method using the excitation characteristics of the speech production. This method is based on the cross correlation of the Hilbert Envelops of linear prediction residuals derived from two microphones signals. The method has been applied to real data obtained by recording many sources captured by a pair of microphones. Experiments show that reverberation distorts the input signals, each reverberation causes an extra peak in the cross-correlation. This makes it difficult to determine which peak is the central time-delay peak and which are just reverberation sidelobes. An alternative time delay estimation method has been implemented and compared to spectrum angular methods.	angularjs;broadcast delay;cross-correlation;delay-gradient congestion control;distortion;experiment;microphone;multilateration	Mariem Bouafif;Zied Lachiri	2012			artificial intelligence;multilateration;speech recognition;underdetermined system;pattern recognition;computer science	Robotics	84.15269632849663	-36.2434066534927	81006

In the new model not only the diameter but also the length of each tube section can be continuously adjusted. This is achieved by using fractional delay filter techniques such as interpolation and deinterpolation. The filter structure consisting of bidirectional delay lines (digital waveguides) and interpolated ports that connect two or more waveguide sections together is called a fractional delay waveguide filter (FDWF). The interpolated version of the two-port scattering junction is presented and a technique for analyzing the degradation due to approximation errors in interpolation and deinterpolation is described. It is shown that when an FDWF structure with Lagrange interpolation is used a vocal tract model needs to be implemented using oversampling. For example, a sampling rate of 22 kHz is adequate for producing high-quality synthetic sounds at a 5 kHz bandwidth.	analog delay line;approximation;elegant degradation;euler–lagrange equation;fractional fourier transform;interpolation;kelly criterion;lagrange polynomial;oversampling;sampling (signal processing);speech synthesis;synthetic data;tract (literature)	Vesa Välimäki;Matti Karjalainen;Timo Kuisma	1994		10.1109/ICASSP.1994.389226	vocal tract;propagation delay;sampling;approximation error;speech recognition;oversampling;digital filter;degradation;lagrange polynomial;interpolation;waveguide filter;computer science;finite impulse response;mathematics;speech synthesis;sampling;intelligibility;bandwidth;statistics	EDA	86.40587216251717	-32.39823256423697	81213

Noise reduction system often requires parameter tuning depending on the environment. The typical parameter tuning is executed by error minimization between the target signal and the filter output after noise reduction. However, the target signal is generally unforeknown in advance, and the minimized error does not assure the high recognition rate of speech recognition system. We employ speech recognition system as an evaluation function of parameter tuning to solve the problems. We implemented the system to a human-size humanoid and verified the effectiveness of the proposed method on an experimental basis.	evaluation function;execution;experiment;hearing;humanoid robot;name;noise (electronics);noise reduction;performance evaluation;population parameter;rewriting;speech recognition	Mitsuharu Matsumoto	2017	IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2017.8216488	control engineering;control theory;engineering;noise reduction;evaluation function	Robotics	85.4756108198073	-34.90107997962581	81272

We present a general framework where additional audio references for one or more sources of a given mixture are available. Each audio reference is another mixture which is supposed to contain at least one source similar to one of the target sources. Deformations between the sources of interest and their references are modeled in a general manner. A nonnegative matrix co-factorization algorithm is used which allows sharing of information between the considered mixtures. We run our algorithm on music plus voice mixtures with music and/or voice references. Applied on movies and TV series data, our algorithm improves the signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) of the sources with the lowest intensity by 9 to 12 decibels with respect to original mixture.	algorithm;decibel;distortion;etsi satellite digital radio;source separation	Nathan Souviraà-Labastie;Anaïk Olivero;Emmanuel Vincent;Frédéric Bimbot	2014	2014 22nd European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)		speech recognition;computer science;multimedia;audio signal flow;communication	Graphics	83.60406857528567	-35.22755995049499	81722

The LCMV beamformer can also reject interferers using linear constraints at the expense of reducing the degree of freedom in a limited number of microphones. However, it may magnify noise that causes a lower output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than the MVDR beamformer. Contrarily, the MVDR beamformer suffers from interference in output. In this paper, we propose a controllable LCMV (C-LCMV) beamformer based on the principles of both the MVDR and LCMV beamformers. The C-LCMV approach can control a compromise between noise reduction and interference rejection. Simulation results show that the C-LCMV beamformer outperforms the MVDR beamformer in interference rejection, and the LCMV beamformer in background noise reduction.	beamforming;interference (communication);microphone;noise reduction;rejection sampling;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Sam Karimian-Azari;Jacob Benesty;Jesper Rindom Jensen;Mads Græsbøll Christensen	2014	2014 22nd European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)		electronic engineering;speech recognition;acoustics;noise-canceling microphone;adaptive beamformer	EDA	84.39950248892737	-34.44612544060014	81991

Especially, for the perception of moving sound sources, a high angular resolution of the measured HRTFs is needed. A continuous HRTF representation with quasi-infinite azimuthal resolution can be obtained with a system identification approach which relies on a sequentially recursive adaptation process. As a consequence, it enables by nature the sequential access of HRTFs, e.g., for the virtualization of rotating sound sources. However, so far the direct access of a HRTF of an arbitrary azimuthal position, for a sudden change of the sound source position, is not possible without knowledge of neighboring HRTFs. To overcome this limitation, we present a new implementation strategy enabling a flexible, i.e., a sequential and direct, access of `Perfect Sequence LMS based HRTFs'. We will prove that we obtain numerically the same high-quality HRTFs as before, without increase of storage requirements, and a significantly reduced computational complexity.	algorithm;angularjs;binaural beats;computational complexity theory;covox speech thing;fits;head-related transfer function;headphones;iteration;numerical analysis;quasiperiodicity;random access;real-time clock;recursion (computer science);requirement;sequential access;system identification	Christiane Antweiler;Peter Vary	2011	2011 19th European Signal Processing Conference		computer vision;speech recognition;acoustics;computer science	EDA	87.27133571399796	-33.95765866361921	82281

In such environments, the use of microphone arrays has been proposed as a means of improving the quality of captured speech signals. Currently, microphone-array-based speech recognition is performed in two independent stages: array processing and then recognition. Array processing algorithms, designed for signal enhancement, are applied in order to reduce the distortion in the speech waveform prior to feature extraction and recognition. This approach assumes that improving the quality of the speech waveform will necessarily result in improved recognition performance and ignores the manner in which speech recognition systems operate. In this paper a new approach to microphone-array processing is proposed in which the goal of the array processing is not to generate an enhanced output waveform but rather to generate a sequence of features which maximizes the likelihood of generating the correct hypothesis. In this approach, called likelihood-maximizing beamforming, information from the speech recognition system itself is used to optimize a filter-and-sum beamformer. Speech recognition experiments performed in a real distant-talking environment confirm the efficacy of the proposed approach.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;array processing;beamforming;distortion;experiment;feature extraction;microphone;speech recognition;utility functions on indivisible goods;waveform	Michael L.

The Bayesian Filtering approach, in particular the Bootstrap (BS) and the Importance Sampling (IS) based Particle Filter (PF) tracking algorithms, has been proposed recently and promising results have been obtained. While these two algorithms out-perform other algorithms, they can only implement the optimal importance function in respective sub-optimal form and suffer related drawbacks in tracking performances. A novel hybrid BS-IS Particle Filter based acoustic source tracking algorithm is proposed in this paper. The height of the target source is used to control a sampling switch importance function that allows the tracking algorithm to switch between using the BS based and the IS based algorithm. Numerical result shows that the proposed algorithm is able to out-perform the BS and the IS based tracking algorithms in reverberant environments.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;bootstrapping (statistics);importance sampling;microphone;numerical method;pf (firewall);particle filter;performance;sampling (signal processing);source tracking	Nannan Li;Wee Ser	2008	2008 16th European Signal Processing Conference		electronic engineering;speech recognition;engineering;control theory	Robotics	85.65932750537293	-36.9042295836635	82888

Subject to bandwidth limitations, present plans call for both 16 Kilobit Continuously Variable Slope Delta Modulation (CVSD) as well as 2.4 Kilobit Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) terminals. Hence the conversion of CVSD to LPC and vice versa arises naturally in this environment. This paper will focus on the CVSD to LPC conversion problem. After a brief discussion of the component system environments, a structure for the format conversion system will be proposed. Since previous work has shown that pitch and voicing decisions can be made on the CVSD observations, the presentation will focus on the identification of LPC predictor coefficients from the noisily observed CVSD data. The remainder of the paper centers on this and the coefficient correction problem, and a new class of linear estimators is shown to yield conditionally unbiased estimates of the LPC coefficients in both noisy and noiseless environments.	continuously variable slope delta modulation	J.

For accurate localization of the sources in seismic and underwater acoustic applications, speed profile is estimated and employed. In contrast to this approach, we propose a new algorithm for wideband DOA estimation with unknown speed profile across the source bandwidth. This insensitivity to dispersion is accomplished by incorporating soft derivative constraint into the optimization problem. The presented simulations exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in estimating the source directions in dispersive medium.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;direction of arrival;dispersive partial differential equation;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;simulation;ultra-wideband	Vinod V.

Thereby, patient safety will be improved and costs as well as medication errors will be reduced considerably. However, the application of RFID and other wireless communication systems has the potential to cause harmful electromagnetic disturbances on sensitive medical devices. This risk mainly depends on the transmission power and the method of data communication. In this contribution we point out the reasons for such incidents and give proposals to overcome these problems. Therefore a novel modulation and transmission technique called Gaussian Derivative Frequency Modulation (GDFM) is developed. Moreover, we carry out measurements to show the inteference properties of different modulation schemes in comparison to our GDFM.	accidental falls;diode;gaussian blur;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;interference (communication);medical device incompatibility problem;medical devices;modulation;normal statistical distribution;patients;radio frequency identification device;radio-frequency identification;semiconductor device;semiconductors	Marie Rieche;Tomas Komensky;Peter Husar	2011	2011 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6090410	radio-frequency identification;frequency modulation;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;transponder;biological engineering;radio frequency;health care	Embedded	93.85874494203844	-24.627920692044682	85157

A spectrum analyzer (SA) is the primary tool for studying the spectral composition of many electrical, acoustic or optical waveforms. It displays a power spectrum over a given frequency range, changing the display as the properties of the signal change. Today, it is an essential element of the engineer's toolbox. In this part, we will start by reviewing SA architectures in an historical perspective. The architectures and working principles of swept based and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based SAs are discussed. Then, we zoom in on the so-called Real-Time Spectrum Analyzers (RTSA) and discuss the more significant performance criteria as a function of the measurement problem at hand. In the last section, we discuss several applications made possible by RTSA. The extension of RTSA with filterbanks is the main topic of Part 2 of this article which will appear in the December 2013 issue of the IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Magazine.	acoustic cryptanalysis;fast fourier transform;frequency band;measurement problem;real-time clock;real-time transcription;spectral density;spectrum analyzer;stationary process	Adnan Al-Adnani;Jonathan Duplicy;Lieven Philips	2013	IEEE Instrumentation & Measurement Magazine	10.1109/MIM.2013.6616284	electronic engineering;spectrum analyzer;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;signal analyzer;spectral density	Embedded	84.23592170005651	-39.6528986239278	85204

Especially for underwater acoustic applications where a large amount of data is available. This paper deals with the estimation of source motion parameters directly from the spatio-temporal data. A general frame for a separate estimation of the spatial frequencies and spatial freq-rate is presented, avoiding thus the dramatic interference problems. One basic idea consists in using basically the relative phase shifts without any consideration of source powers. The other consists in considering interpolation a s a basic tool for spatia-temporal analysis.	acoustic cryptanalysis;general frame;interference (communication);interpolation	Jean-Pierre Le Cadre;Olivier Trémois	1994		10.1109/ICASSP.1994.389783	computer vision;underwater acoustics;speech recognition;interpolation;motion estimation;phase;spatial frequency;estimation theory;statistics	Graphics	86.42693485484253	-38.50725722747786	85317
7159caa1c615eeb6e5209f36c6c5aeb4825d2df3	abnormal sound detection by two microphones using virtual microphone technique		In this paper, we propose a new method of microphone array signal processing for detecting abnormal sounds that is applicable to monitoring elderly people at home and can be implemented on small equipment. This method consists of noise reduction based on a subspace method and sound activity detection (SAD), which is the same as voice activity detection using the signal power. The performance of noise reduction may degrade for underdetermined conditions (the number of microphones is less than that of sound sources). To resolve this issue, we previously proposed a technique of microphone array signal processing that introduced virtual microphones. In this method, signals of virtual microphones are interpolated with those of real ones. By using both real and virtual microphones, this noise reduction method can be applied for a critical / overdetermined condition. In this paper, we apply this method to the subspace method for the first time. After noise reduction, the abnormal sounds can be detected by the SAD method. We conducted an experiment and confirm that the proposed method is effective for detecting abnormal sounds in noisy environments and is robust to abnormal sound directions.	direction of arrival;interpolation;microphone;noise reduction;sensor;signal processing;simulation;ti advanced scientific computer;voice activity detection	Kouei Yamaoka;Nobutaka Ono;Shoji Makino;Takeshi Yamada	2017	2017 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA ASC)	10.1109/APSIPA.2017.8282079	voice activity detection;noise reduction;microphone array;acoustics;underdetermined system;signal processing;subspace topology;microphone;sound detection;computer science	EDA	84.6249892650967	-36.58683338705878	85501

These phenomena induce faulty data that disrupt the precise localization of the GNSS receiver. In this study, we detect the outliers among the observations, Pseudo-Range (PR) and/or Doppler measurements, and we evaluate how discarding them improves the localization. We specify a contrario modeling for GNSS raw data to derive an algorithm that partitions the dataset between inliers and outliers. Then, only the inlier data are considered in the localization process performed either through a classical Particle Filter (PF) or a Rao-Blackwellization (RB) approach. Both localization algorithms exclusively use GNSS data, but they differ by the way Doppler measurements are processed. An experiment has been performed with a GPS receiver aboard a vehicle. Results show that the proposed algorithms are able to detect the 'outliers' in the raw data while being robust to non-Gaussian noise and to intermittent satellite blockage. We compare the performance results achieved either estimating only PR outliers or estimating both PR and Doppler outliers. The best localization is achieved using the RB approach coupled with PR-Doppler outlier estimation.	aoc2 protein, human;alcohol use inventory;anomaly detection;arabic numeral 0;assumed;attachment unit interface;cns disorder;cr rao advanced institute of mathematics, statistics and computer science;clock drift;coefficient;computation;conflict (psychology);doppler effect;estimated;experiment;fc epsilon ri + rii ab:acnc:pt:ser:qn;galileo (satellite navigation);gauss;gauss–newton algorithm;global positioning system;gray platelet syndrome;international system of units;intestinal pseudo-obstruction;jacobian matrix and determinant;linear function;mathematical optimization;matrix regularization;multipath propagation;newton;niflumic acid;nondeterministic finite automaton;nonlinear system;normal statistical distribution;null value;numerical linear algebra;outlier;parallel computing;particle filter;poly da-dt;population parameter;pruritus ani;pseudo brand of pseudoephedrine;reagents;satellite navigation;seizures;silo (dataset);solver;uridine;velocity (software development);algorithm;travel	Salim Zair;Sylvie Le Hégarat-Mascle;Emmanuel Seignez	2016		10.3390/s16040580	electronic engineering;particle filter;telecommunications;computer science;statistics;remote sensing	ML	85.28111514813241	-42.21656854054011	85683

The proposed structure introduces a delay only into the adaptation algorithm, which compensates for doubletalk detector response time at the onset of near-end speech. The structure is described and analyzed for the NLMS and cross-correlation-based doubletalk detector algorithms. The method introduces no delay into the return path, and no additional constraints on adaptation step size arise. Simulations with ITU-T Q. 168 tests confirm that the proposed structure prevents divergence at the onset of doubletalk for near-end to echo signal ratios of-26 to -6 dB.	algorithm;bounce address;computer simulation;cross-correlation;echo (command);least mean squares filter;onset (audio);response time (technology)	James D.

Also, volume contraction has been applied effectively to trap the global maximum for densely-hilly 3-D spaces like the SRP. However, previous methods have suffered from the presence of peaks representing multiple talkers in close proximity as is likely in a conversational cocktail-party setting. We present a volume contraction algorithm called Multi-Stage Rejection Sampling (MSRS) for detection of multiple peaks in the SRP-PHAT space. Our method not only circumvents sorting - a computationally expensive step in volume contraction algorithms - but also automatically divides a search volume into sub-volumes for robust detection of multiple peaks. We discuss some modifications to the standard SRP-PHAT functional and present results using all real-room data for baseline white-noise, an eight-speaker teleconferencing setup and a fully unconstrained cocktail-party situation containing about 21 persons in the room.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;baseline (configuration management);maxima and minima;model-specific register;rejection sampling;scsi rdma protocol;sampling (signal processing);sorting;white noise	Sarthak Khanal;Harvey F.

5b402b36f4b18f69853aaa8207449d146aaf8718	aim: acoustic imaging on a mobile		The popularity of smartphones has grown at an unprecedented rate, which makes smartphone based imaging especially appealing. In this paper, we develop a novel acoustic imaging system using only an off-the-shelf smartphone. It is an attractive alternative to camera based imaging under darkness and obstruction. Our system is based on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). To image an object, a user moves a phone along a predefined trajectory to mimic a virtual sensor array. SAR based imaging poses several new challenges in our context, including strong self and background interference, deviation from the desired trajectory due to hand jitters, and severe speaker/microphone distortion. We address these challenges by developing a 2-stage interference cancellation scheme, a new algorithm to compensate trajectory errors, and an effective method to minimize the impact of signal distortion. We implement a proof-of-concept system on Samsung S7. Our results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of acoustic imaging on a mobile.	aim alliance;acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;aperture (software);carrier frequency;digital data;distortion;effective method;error detection and correction;experiment;gaussian blur;ibm notes;image quality;interference (communication);microphone;robertson–seymour theorem;smartphone	Wenguang Mao;Mei Wang;Lili Qiu	2018		10.1145/3210240.3210325	single antenna interference cancellation;microphone;real-time computing;computer science;distortion;sensor array;synthetic aperture radar;effective method;autofocus;trajectory	Mobile	86.60657888431598	-40.33149816789017	86085

The presented approach employs a formulation of the reproduction equation in spatial frequency domain which is explicitly solved for the secondary source driving signals. Wave field synthesis (WFS), the alternative formulation, can be shown to be equivalent under equal assumptions. Unlike the WFS formulation, the presented approach does not employ a far-field approximation when linear secondary source distributions are considered but provides exact results. We focus on the investigation of the spatial truncation and discretization of the secondary source distribution occurring in real-world implementations and present a rigorous analysis of evanescent and propagating components in the reproduced sound field.	approximation;discretization;evanescent field;loudspeaker;planar (computer graphics);secondary source;truncation	Jens Ahrens;Sascha Spors	2010	IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing	10.1109/TASL.2010.2041106	fourier transform;speech recognition;acoustics;mathematics	Visualization	87.91381549351789	-32.48479936769833	86538

Corresponding noise and range performance trade-offs are examined here, with regard to choice of frequency and technology. The frequency range examined includes part of the UHF and microwave spectrum. Underwater detection of motion by radar in freshwater and saltwater are demonstrated. Radar measurements exhibited reduced susceptibility to noise as compared to ultrasound. While higher frequency radar exhibited better signal to noise ratio, propagation was superior for lower frequencies. Radar detection of motion through saltwater was also demonstrated at restricted ranges (1–2 cm) with low power transmission (10 dBm). The results facilitate the establishment of guidelines for optimal choice in technology for the underwater measurement motion-based life signs, with respect to trade offs involving range and noise.	aquatic ecosystem;dbm;frequency band;image noise;metabolic process, cellular;microwave;monitoring, physiologic;radar;signal-to-noise ratio;software propagation;ultra high frequency;ultrasonography	Noah Hafner;Victor M.

In a mobile communications environment, speech signals are degraded by additive random noise. Randomness of the noise, which is often described in terms of its first and second order statistics, makes it difficult to remove without introducing background artifacts. This is particularly true for lower signal to background noise ratios. The technique described in this paper deals with the noise reduction of the vocoded speech signals without any knowledge of the signal to background noise ratio. In general, low bit rate speech coding systems do not have their own mechanism to reduce the background noise from the speech signal. This is due to the complexity of the speech signal and limitations in the scope of many speech coding systems. As a consequence, most speech enhancement systems to date have attempted to process the speech waveform directly and independently from the speech coding system, before the encoding of speech signals. In this paper, we propose a new noise reduction technique which is based upon the harmonic excitation linear predictive coding (HE-LPC) and can be applied to and integrated with any sinusoidal based speech coding algorithm.	noise reduction;speech coding	Suat Yeldener;Jack H.

Dimensions derived from proximity matrices were interpreted as electroacoustic distortions. The weighting of these distortions were analyzed and contrasted to correlational analysis. Interactions were present between the speech and music judgments. Frequency response and bandwidth were evidenced as dimensions influencing both speech and music with third harmonic distortion and internal noise being specific to speech, while transient distortions and phase distortion affected listener preception of music.	distortion;multidimensional analysis	A.

We form the multichannel electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensor data as a spatial-temporal response matrix (STRM). The rows of the STRM correspond to measurements sampled at different time channels from one sensor and the columns correspond to measurements sampled at the same time channel from different sensors. The singular value decomposition of the STRM produces the left and right singular vectors that are related to the sensor and the temporal spaces, respectively. If the effective rank of the STRM is r, then the first r singular vectors span signal subspaces (SS), and the remaining singular vectors span the noise subspaces. The original data are projected onto the SS, and the temporal orthogonal projection inversion (TOPI) uses these data in a nonlinear inverse problem to solve for source locations of the objects. The polarizations of the targets are then obtained by solving a linear optimization problem in the original data domain. We present theoretical and numerical analyses to investigate the singular value system of the STRM and the sensitivity of the TOPI to the size of an SS. Only a few subspace vectors are required to generate locations of the objects. The results are insensitive to the exact choice of rank, and this differs from usual methods that involve selecting the number of time channels to be used in the inversion and carefully estimating associated uncertainties. The proposed approach is evaluated using the synthetic and real multistatic EMI data.	column (database);data domain;emi;linear programming;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;optimization problem;sensor;singular value decomposition;synthetic intelligence;value (ethics)	Lin-Ping Song;Douglas Oldenburg;Leonard R.

4eef222aa0c01581c74f39477ab2eecebf2ec41e	speech and crosstalk detection for robust speech recognition using a dual microphone system	crosstalk;speech activity detection;multi channel audio	This paper proposes a practical speech detection technique for robust automatic speech recognition, suitable for use under various interference conditions. This technique consists of a dual microphone system and an algorithm for processing their signals. The microphone module is placed in the workplace of the target speaker. The module consists of two symmetrical supercardioid microphones directed in opposite directions. The algorithm of target speaker detection is proposed for this scheme. This algorithm makes it possible to implement spatial filtering of speakers. Experiments with real recordings demonstrate a significant reduction of speech recognition errors for the target speaker due to suppression of acoustic crosstalk. The main advantage of the proposed technique is simplicity of its use in a wide range of practical situations.	crosstalk;microphone;speech recognition	Mikhail Stolbov;Marina Tatarnikova	2013		10.1007/978-3-319-01931-4_41	voice activity detection;speech recognition;acoustics;engineering;speech processing;communication	Mobile	84.37579269847443	-34.420829300256855	88641

This type of communication can be difficult due to a number of factors, including distance between speakers, noise and lack of visual contact. The system described makes use of a set of microphones to pick up the speech of each passenger, then it amplifies these signals and plays them back to the cabin through the car audio loudspeaker system. The two main problems are noise amplification and electro-acoustic coupling between loudspeakers and microphones. To overcome these problems the system uses a set of acoustic echo cancellers, echo suppression filters and noise reduction stages. In this paper, the stability of a speech reinforcement system is studied. We propose a solution based on echo cancellers and residual echo suppression filters. The spectral estimation method for the power spectral density of the residual echo existing after the echo canceller is presented along with the derivation of the optimal residual echo suppression filter.

The signal quality may differ strongly among the speaker channels depending on the microphone position, the microphone type, the kind of background noise, and the speaker himself. When combining these signals to a weighted mix annoying switching artifacts may result. In this contribution a new dynamic signal mixer is presented that uses spectral preprocessing to compensate both for different speech signal levels and for different background noise levels and colorations. Thus, artifacts are avoided and smooth transitions can be achieved for the various speech level and the background noise spectrum at speaker changes.	colors of noise;microphone;preprocessor;ringing artifacts	Timo Matheja;Markus Buck;Achim Eichentopf	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2011.5947502	speaker recognition;speech recognition;noise-canceling microphone;computer science;particle detector	Robotics	84.19378761117753	-34.08430340879399	89234

We exploit the periodicity of TDMA type systems where the transmitter burst envelope is stationary. Since samples of the transmitter burst envelope are correlated to the additive noise that corrupts the sampled speech, we use this as a reference input to the ANC. We may also obtain the reference input by delaying the primary input to de-correlate the speech. The system was simulated using GSM [4] transmit burst model to demonstrate the noise power reduction as a function of adaptation. Preliminary tests using the GSM transmitter burst model indicate at least −40 dB of noise reduction after ½ second of convergence. The spectral noise characteristics after system convergence are analyzed. We also use a test speech signal to demonstrate the system.	additive white gaussian noise;burst error;burst noise;noise power;noise reduction;quasiperiodicity;stationary process;transmitter;type system;utility functions on indivisible goods	David S.

Direct measurements that are reliable only exist for the past fewdecades. Therefore knowledge of prior variations has to be established based on indirect information derived fromnatural archives. The challenge has always been to find a strict objectivemethod that can identify volcanic events and offer sound amplitude estimates in these noisy records. An automatic procedure is introduced here to estimate the magnitude of strong, but short-lived, volcanic signals from a suite of polar ice core series. Rather than treating records from individual ice cores separately and then averaging their respective magnitudes, our extraction algorithm jointly handles multiple time series to identify their common, but hidden, volcanic pulses. The statistical procedure is based on a multivariate multi-state space model. Exploiting the joint fluctuations, it provides an accurate estimator of the timing, peak magnitude and duration of individual pulse-like deposition events within a set of different series. This ensures a more effective separation of the real signals from spurious noise that can occur in any individual time series, and thus a higher sensitivity to identify smaller scale events. At the same time, it provides ameasure of confidence through the posterior probability for each pulse-like event, indicating how well a pulse can be recognized against the background noise. The flexibility and robustness of our approach, as well as important underlying assumptions and remaining limitations, are discussed by applying our method to first simulated and then real world ice core time series. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

It formulates the traditional HRRP synthetic to be a sparse approximation problem over redundant dictionary. As it employs a priori that the synthetic range profile (SRP) of targets are sparse, SRP can be accomplished even in presence of data lost. Besides, the computation complexity decreases from O(MNDK) flops for OMP to O(M(N + D)K) flops for OMP-SD by introducing sensing dictionary (SD). Simulation experiments illustrate its advantages both in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and noiseless situation, respectively.

The generalized cross correlation (GCC) method is the most important approach for estimating TDOA between microphone pairs. The performance of this method significantly degrades in the presence of noise and reverberation. This paper addresses the problem of 3D localization in joint noisy and reverberant conditions and a single-speaker scenario. We first propose a modification to make the GCC-PHAse transform (GCC-PHAT) method robust against environment noise. Then, we use an iterative technique that employs location estimation to improve TDOAs accuracy. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real (practical) data (in a single-source scenario) show the capability of the proposed methods to significantly improve TDOA accuracy and, consequently, source location estimates.	cross-correlation;experiment;hybrid algorithm;iterative method;microphone;multilateration;weight function	Hamid Reza Abutalebi;Hossein Momenzadeh	2011	EURASIP J.

This method first uses estimates of the source locations to construct a transformation, which removes the correlated interfering sources while retaining the desired sources. Conventional adaptive beamformers is then performed on the transformed data containing only desired sources to obtain accurate source time course estimates. Repeatedly applying the method to each of the correlated sources can accurately reconstruct all the source time courses. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed method can remove the leakage from the other correlated sources and thus, obtain accurate source time courses estimates. Numerical experiments show that, compared to the conventional adaptive beamformers, the proposed method can reconstruct the source time courses without distortions.	distortion;electroencephalography;experiment;numerical method;spectral leakage;waveform	Junpeng Zhang;Xuyang Huo	2012	2012 5th International Conference on BioMedical Engineering and Informatics	10.1109/BMEI.2012.6512900	signal reconstruction;econometrics;speech recognition;electroencephalography;computer science	DB	82.9198748740442	-38.66798791445239	90963

Our method constructs the beam tree on the fly through an iterative lookup process of a precomputed data structure that collects the information on the exact mutual visibility among all reflectors in the environment (region-to-region visibility). This information is encoded in the form of visibility regions that are conveniently represented in the space of acoustic rays using the Plücker coordinates. During the beam tracing phase, the visibility of the environment from the source position (the beam tree) is evaluated by traversing the precomputed visibility data structure and testing the presence of beams inside the visibility regions. The Plücker parameterization simplifies this procedure and reduces its computational burden, as it turns out to be an iterative intersection of linear subspaces. Similarly, during the path determination phase, acoustic paths are found by testing their presence within the nodes of the beam tree data structure. The simulations show that, with an average computation time per beam in the order of a dozen of microseconds, the proposed method can compute a large number of beams at rates suitable for interactive applications with moving sources and receivers.	acoustic cryptanalysis;beam tracing;computation (action);data structure;generalization (psychology);intersection of set of elements;iterative method;lichtenberg figure;lookup table;manuscripts;on the fly;precomputation;radiation;reflection (computer graphics);semantic parameterization;simulation;solutions;time complexity;tree (data structure);trees (plant)	Dejan Markovic;Fabio Antonacci;Augusto Sarti;Stefano Tubaro	2016	IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics	10.1109/TVCG.2016.2515612	computer vision;simulation;data structure;room acoustics;computer science;theoretical computer science;beam tracing;computational model	Visualization	87.24093749826395	-34.22796501533115	91934

In distant-talking situations, users can speak at arbitrary positions while moving. Therefore, it is very important for high quality speech acquisition using microphone arrays to localize a talker accurately. However, it is very difficult to localize a moving talker in noisy and reverberant environments. The talker localization errors result in performance degradation of speech recognition. One way to solve this problem is to integrate the speech recognition process and the talker localization into a unified framework. This paper proposes a new speech recognition algorithm based on a three-dimensional (3-D) Viterbi search. The 3-D Viterbi method extracts a direction-time sequence of parameter vectors by steering a beam to every direction in every frame, then finds the most likely path in a 3-D trellis space composed of talker directions, input frames and HMM states. This means that speech recognition and talker localization are performed simultaneously within a statistical framework. To evaluate the performance of the 3-D Viterbi method, recognition experiments for real environment data were carried out. The results confirmed that the 3-D Viterbi method drastically improves the recognition performance for the moving talker case as well as for the fixed-position talker case.	display resolution;elegant degradation;experiment;hidden markov model;microphone;speech acquisition;speech recognition;time series;trellis quantization;unified framework;viterbi algorithm	Takeshi Yamada;Satoshi Nakamura;Kiyohiro Shikano	2002	IEEE Trans.

30bbcb05c68d6247d9bee3961951eb95bc5bf75b	on robust inverse filter design for room transfer function fluctuations		Dereverberation methods based on the inverse filtering of room transfer functions (RTFs) are attractive because high deconvolution performance can be achieved. Although many methods assume that the RTFs are time-invariant, this assumption would not be guaranteed in practice. This paper deals with the problem of the sensitivity of a dereverberation algorithm based on inverse filtering. We evaluate the effect of RTF fluctuations caused by source position changes on the dereverberation performance. We focus on the filter energy with a view to making the filter less sensitive as regards these fluctuations. By adjusting three design parameters, namely, filter length, modeling delay, and regularization parameter, a dereverberation performance of up to 15 dB of the signal-to-distortion ratio could be obtained when the source position was changed with one-eighth wavelength distance, whereas conventional investigations have claimed that such a variation would cause a large degradation.	algorithm;deconvolution;distortion;elegant degradation;filter design;inverse filter;simulation;the filter;time-invariant system;transfer function;verse protocol	Takafumi Hikichi;Marc Delcroix;Masato Miyoshi	2006	2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference		mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;root-raised-cosine filter;control theory;mathematics	Visualization	84.83689000073396	-33.73112244753632	93098
3794659426ff204d5c3e6bc6e9752d28921f779e	extraction of acoustic sources through the processing of sound field maps in the ray space		Our goal is to develop a model-based approach to acoustic source extraction from microphone array data, which is suitable for both near-field and far-field sources. A signal representation based on plane-wave PW decomposition is suitable for acoustic sources in the far field as the resulting spectrum turns out to be impulsive. When the source approaches the array, however, the curvature of the wavefront causes the spectrum of the PW components to depart from impulsive behavior, thus making source extraction harder to attain. In this paper, we adopt a sound field representation based on the local estimation of the plenacoustic function along the array line. This approach consists of dividing the array into subarrays, and applying the PW analysis on individual subarrays. This has the immediate result of extending the range of validity of the far-field hypothesis, as a source that enters the near-field range of the extended array is still in the far-field range of the subarrays. PW analysis on subarrays allows us to construct the so-called sound field map in a domain of acoustic visibility called ray space. The extraction of the desired source is accomplished through spatial filtering of the sound field map. The design of the spatial filter relies on a linear minimum mean square error criterion defined on the sound field map. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is proven through an extensive simulation campaign as well as real experiments.	acoustic cryptanalysis;experiment;mean squared error;microphone;simulation	Dejan Markovic;Fabio Antonacci;Lucio Bianchi;Stefano Tubaro;Augusto Sarti	2016	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing	10.1109/TASLP.2016.2615242	speech recognition;acoustics;telecommunications;acoustic source localization	Visualization	85.72543093949201	-37.94821404810344	93357

A limitation of such systems is that they produce enhanced room transfer functions that contain unnaturally large peaks. These peaks produce colouration of the sound decay. A stochastic simulation technique is presented that quantifies colouration by measuring the probability density function of the transfer functions and comparing it with the ideal Rayleigh distribution of an unassisted room. The technique is applied to existing reverberation systems, and to a new system which provides large increases in reverberation time without increasing the loop gain. It is shown that, for the same power gain, the new system produces a higher colouration, but that this problem may be eliminated by the use of an allpass reverberator.	all-pass filter;autowave reverberator;power gain;rayleigh–ritz method;simulation	Mark A.

PEIF is used for preprocessing of the SFGS, and we quantitatively evaluate SFGS using a real signal. When the output signal of SFGS is reproduced in the reproduction field, the effect of the SFGS is diminished due to the impulse response of reproduction field that is added to the created SFGS signal. Therefore, we attempted to reduce the influence of the reproduction field using a PEIF. In the experiment, we used five signals, namely, male speech, female speech, male vocal with music, female vocal with music, and classical music, and these signals were processed by computer simulation. We evaluated these signals by objective evaluation and subjective evaluation.

Computer vision and acoustic time of arrival data are used to obtain microphone coordinates in the camera reference frame. Our new method allows acoustic maps to be plotted onto the camera images without the need for additional camera alignment or calibration. Microphones and cameras may be placed in an ad-hoc arrangement and, after calibration, the coordinates of the microphones are known in the reference frame of a camera in the array. No prior knowledge of microphone positions, inter-microphone spacings, or air temperature is required. This technique is applied to a spherical microphone array and a mean difference of 3 mm was obtained between the coordinates obtained with this calibration technique and those measured using a precision mechanical method.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;beamforming;calibration;clean;computer vision;covox speech thing;diameter (qualifier value);digital camera;euclidean distance;grid reference;hoc (programming language);map;microphone device component;optical computing;reference frame (video);time of arrival	Mathew Legg;Stuart Bradley	2013	IEEE Transactions on Image Processing	10.1109/TIP.2013.2268974	computer vision;camera auto-calibration;calibration;camera resectioning;computer science;optoacoustic imaging	Vision	87.27225261929836	-35.662377520464226	93842

Adequate compaction is necessary for the long term performance of an asphalt pavement. Inadequate/improper compaction is one of the leading causes of early deterioration and failure of these pavements. Current quality control procedures also depend on destructive testing to ascertain the quality and thereby contribute to the early failure of the pavements. Non-destructive Intelligent Compaction (IC) techniques have been introduced to control the quality of construction of these pavements, but with limited success. Currently available IC systems display real-time measurements that are indicative of the pavement quality. However, these measurements are not adequately correlated with any measurements obtained from the finished pavement. One of the reasons for the poor accuracy is the lack of adequate modeling and mathematical analysis in the design of IC systems. These systems are typically built using heuristic data and are not amenable to mathematical analysis. In this paper, the dynamics of the vibratory compactor is studied and the effect of system parameters like the thickness of the pavement, type of asphalt mix, etc., on the response characteristics is determined. These measurements are then used to analyze the transient response of a vibratory roller during compaction. The response characteristics provide an insight into the requirements for feedback control and can be used as a starting point for improving the performance of IC systems.	data compaction;feedback;heuristic;real-time clock;requirement;thickness (graph theory)	Syed Asif Imran;Fares N.

In these applications, the speech input signal of the adaptive filter is highly correlated and the impulse response of the echo path is very long. These characteristics will slow down the convergence rate of the adaptive filter if the well-known normalized least-mean-square (NLMS) algorithm is used. The normalized subband adaptive filter (NSAF) offers a good solution to this problem because of its decorrelating property. However, similar to the NLMS-based adaptive filter, the NSAF requires a tradeoff between fast convergence rate and small steady-state mean-square error (MSE). In this paper, we propose an adaptive combination scheme to address this tradeoff. The combination is carried out in subband domain and the mixing parameter that controls the combination is adapted by means of a stochastic gradient algorithm which employs the sum of squared subband errors as the cost function. The performance of the proposed combination scheme is evaluated in the context of acoustic echo cancellation (AEC). Experimental results show that the combination scheme can obtain both fast convergence rate and small steady-state MSE.	acoustic coupler;acoustic cryptanalysis;adaptive filter;algorithm;decorrelation;echo suppression and cancellation;gradient;least mean squares filter;loss function;mean squared error;rate of convergence;simulation;steady state;whole earth 'lectronic link	Jingen Ni;Feng Li	2010	IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics	10.1109/TCE.2010.5606296	adaptive filter;computer vision;electronic engineering;speech recognition;kernel adaptive filter;computer science	Mobile	83.78032562306996	-33.37304965884849	94195

In the log-domain, the MIXMAX interaction model is the corresponding approximation for the linear model. Hence, one would expect similar performance for both approaches. However, in this paper we empirically show that this is not the case for vector-quantizer-based (VQ) single channel source separation. We propose factorial linear-VQ, the linear counterpart to factorial max-VQ, and compare the two methods in systematic source separation experiments. Linear-VQ performs significantly better than max-VQ for comparable code-book sizes and behaves more robustly in the presence of additive white noise. Furthermore, we compare resynthesis properties of binary and continuous time-frequency masks. While binary masks achieve a higher interference suppression, the use of continuous masks results in a consistently better signal quality.	approximation;bitwise operation;experiment;interference (communication);linear model;mathematical model;quantization (signal processing);source separation;spectrogram;utility functions on indivisible goods;variable shadowing;vector quantization;white noise;zero suppression	Robert Peharz;Franz Pernkopf	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6287864	speech recognition;time–frequency analysis;audio signal processing;computer science;speech;pattern recognition;mathematics;signal-to-noise ratio;hidden markov model;statistics;approximation theory	Vision	83.45125940497117	-33.09690136016376	94370

We developed a method to estimate the distance to the hidden object by applying acoustic diffraction of audible sound. Our method is based on time-of-flight (TOF), which has been used in ultrasound ranging systems. We determined the best frequency of audible sound and designed its optimal modulated signal for our system. We determined that the system estimates the distance to the hidden object as well as the obstacle. However, the measurement signal obtained from the hidden object was weak. Thus, interference from sound signals reflected from other objects or walls was not negligible. Therefore, we combined acoustical holography (AH) and TOF, which enabled a partial analysis of the reflection sound intensity field around the obstacle and hidden object. Our method was effective for ranging two objects of the same size within a 1.2 m depth range. The accuracy of our method was 3 cm for the obstacle, and 6 cm for the hidden object.	acoustic cryptanalysis;holography;interference (communication);modulation	Haruhiko Niwa;Tetsuya Ogata;Kazunori Komatani;Hiroshi G.

We propose a method that makes use of the estimated near-end signal from a postfilter to further improve the AEC system performance. The cancellation performance is enhanced especially during strong near-end interference (e.g., double talk). Simulation results show that our stereophonic AEC based on the system approach with postfilter integration outperforms the one using the original robust AEC system by itself without postfilter integration. The improved performance is noted especially during double talk, where simulation results show that the true echo return loss enhancement can be boosted by as much as 10 dB.	acoustic coupler;acoustic cryptanalysis;echo suppression and cancellation;interference (communication);return loss;simulation	Jason Wung;Ted S.

It is particularly challenging in the presence of noise and reverberation, and when the source signal is speech which is inherently nonstationary and random. The most important TDE algorithms for two sensors are based on the generalized cross-correlation (GCC) method. These algorithms perform reasonably well when reverberation or noise is not too high. In an earlier study of the authors, a more sophisticated approach was proposed. It employs more sensors and takes advantage of their delay redundancy to improve the precision of the TDOA (time difference of arrival) estimate between the first two sensors. The approach is based on the multichannel cross-correlation coefficient (MCCC) and was found more robust to noise and reverberation. In this paper, we show that this approach can also be developed on a basis of joint entropy. For Gaussian signals, we show that, in the search of the TDOA estimate, maximizing MCCC is equivalent to minimizing joint entropy. But with the generalization of the idea to non-Gaussian speech signals, the joint entropy based new multichannel TDE algorithm manifests a potential to outperform the MCCC-based method. Since there is no rigorous mathematical formula for speech entropy, we use the assumption that speech can be plausibly modeled by a Laplace distribution and develop a practical approximation of Laplace entropy for TDE of speech signals. The performance of the proposed new algorithm is investigated via simulations.	algorithm;approximation;coefficient;computer simulation;cross-correlation;decibel;joint entropy;microphone;multilateration;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;speech synthesis;transparent data encryption	Yiteng Huang;Jacob Benesty;Jingdong Chen	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - ICASSP '07	10.1109/ICASSP.2007.366629	entropy;speech recognition;multilateration;cross-correlation;gaussian process;speech processing;laplace distribution;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	83.29257167332409	-36.13223230050575	94744

To avoid the range migration problems that occur in HRR radar data, we first divide the HRR range profiles into low-range resolution (LRR) segments. Since each LRR segment contains a sequence of HRR range bins, no information is lost due to the division, and hence, no loss of resolution occurs. We show how to use a vector auto-regressive (VAR) filtering technique to suppress the ground clutter. Then, a parameter estimation algorithm is proposed for target feature extraction. From the VAR-filtered data, the target Doppler frequency and the spatial signature vectors are first estimated by using a maximum likelihood (ML) method. The target phase history and direction-of-arrival (DOA) (or the array steering vector for unknown array manifold) are then estimated from the spatial signature vectors by minimizing a weighted least squares (WLS) cost function. The target radar cross section (RCS)-related complex amplitude and range-related frequency of each target scatterer are then extracted from the estimated target phase history by using RELAX, which is a relaxation-based high-resolution feature extraction algorithm. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.	airborne ranger;algorithm;auto-tune;clutter;cross section (geometry);direction of arrival;estimation theory;feature extraction;image resolution;least squares;linear programming relaxation;loss function;numerical method;phased array;phasor;radar signal characteristics	Jian Li;Guoqing Liu;Nanzhi Jiang;Petre Stoica	2001	IEEE Trans.

The noisy speech is first decomposed into critical band signals by an auditory filterbank and the denoising is carried out on the subband signals. The time varying subband noise variance required for denoising is estimated by tracking the minimum variance of the subband noisy signal. Auditory masking is applied to calculate the optimum denoising gain using a Wiener filtering approach to minimize the perceived speech distortion. This denoising technique is suitable for coloured and nonstationary noise environments. It gives natural sounding speech with a very low level of musical noise.	automatic sounding;critical band;distortion;filter bank;noise reduction;speech enhancement;unsharp masking;wiener filter	Lee Lin;W.

Commercial 3D probes are usually set up with three mutually perpendicular 1D p-p probes and, thus, arranged with six microphones; although sound intensity can be calculated with 15 independent pairs of transducers, only the three """"primary"""" pairs that are aligned with the coordinate system axes. The other 12 """"secondary"""" pairs consist of mutually perpendicular microphones, which are placed at a distance that is radic2 times shorter than the primary one. The main idea of the proposed method is to average the intensity that is measured on primary and secondary pairs. This leads to a larger bandwidth, thanks to the shorter separating distance between secondary pairs. The intrinsic p-p method high- frequency sensitivity loss is partially recovered, starting from the theoretical plane wave expression. Measurements of different axes are weighted with coefficients that are computed by optimizing the measurement uncertainty. Errors that are due to the metrological characteristics of the transducers and the effects of environmental conditions are compensated. Experimental results showed that a p-p probe arranged with half-inch microphones that are placed at a distance of 50 mm allows reliable measurements up to 2.5 kHz, whereas a commercial probe bandwidth with the same configuration is usually 1250 Hz."""	approximation error;coefficient;microphone;transducer	Giovanni Moschioni;Bortolino Saggin;Marco Tarabini	2008	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2008.919865	acoustic wave;electronic engineering;plane wave;uncertainty;acoustics;pressure measurement;coordinate system;high frequency;sensor fusion;intensity;optics;sound;bandwidth;physics;quantum mechanics;statistics;measurement uncertainty	Visualization	87.77924994918004	-35.806442831957604	95482

Specifically, we develop an activity measure using the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) framework to detect if an electronic waveform is present at a laser scan location while a test program is repeatedly run. By plotting the activity score against laser scan location, an activity image is developed showing the measured activity in different parts of the IC. We show that this technique allows detection of all active regions in an operating IC, while requiring a relatively low number of signal acquisitions.	electroencephalography;integrated circuit;waveform	Erik Matlin;Neil Troy;David Stoker	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)	10.1109/ICIP.2014.7026177	computer vision;image processing;computer science;detection theory	Robotics	93.82868405220538	-28.115704471266035	95997

In our previous study, it was found that optimized iterative spectral subtraction (SS) results in speech enhancement with almost no musical noise generation, but this method is valid only for stationary noise. The proposed method consists of iterative blind dynamic noise estimation by, e.g., independent component analysis (ICA) or multichannel Wiener filtering, and musicalnoise-free speech extraction by modified iterative SS, where multiple iterative SS is applied to each channel while maintaining the multichannel property reused for the dynamic noise estimators. Also, in relation to the proposed method, we discuss the justification of applying ICA to signals nonlinearly distorted by SS. From objective and subjective evaluations simulating a real-world hands-free speech communication system, we reveal that the proposed method outperforms the conventional methods. & 2014 The Authors.

To improve the robustness against outdoor acoustic noise, we propose to combine two sound source localization methods based on MUSIC (multiple signal classification) to cope with trade-off between latency and noise robustness. The standard Eigenvalue decomposition based MUSIC (SEVD-MUSIC) has smaller latency but less noise robustness, whereas the incremental generalized singular value decomposition based MUSIC (iGSVD-MUSIC) has higher noise robustness but larger latency. A UAV operator can use an appropriate method according to the situation. A sound enhancement method called online robust principal component analysis (ORPCA) enables the operator to detect a target sound source more easily. To improve the stability of wireless communication, and robustness of the UAV system against weather changes, we developed data compression based on free lossless audio codec (FLAC) extended to support a 16 ch audio data stream via UDP, and developed a water-resistant microphone array. The resulting system successfully worked in an outdoor search and rescue task in ImPACT Tough Robotics Challenge in November 2016.	acoustic cryptanalysis;codec;covox speech thing;data compression;embedded system;lossless compression;music (algorithm);microphone;norm (social);open-source software;real-time clock;robot;robotics;robust principal component analysis;singular value decomposition;software deployment;television antenna;unmanned aerial vehicle	Kazuhiro Nakadai;Makoto Kumon;Hiroshi G.

2736f8472bce4136950c9dde6981865b73cb95de	illuminant-camera communication to observe moving objects under strong external light by spread spectrum modulation		Many algorithms of computer vision use light sources to illuminate objects to actively create situation appropriate to extract their characteristics. For example, the shape and reflectance are measured by a projector-camera system, and some human-machine or VR systems use projectors and displays for interaction. As existing active lighting systems usually assume no severe external lights to observe projected lights clearly, it is one of the limitations of active illumination. In this paper, we propose a method of energy-efficient active illumination in an environment with severe external lights. The proposed method extracts the light signals of illuminants by removing external light using spread spectrum modulation. Because an image sequence is needed to observe modulated signals, the proposed method extends signal processing to realize signal detection projected onto moving objects by combining spread spectrum modulation and spatio-temporal filtering. In the experiments, we apply the proposed method to a structured-light system under sunlight, to photometric stereo with external lights, and to insensible image embedding.	algorithm;computer vision;detection theory;experiment;modulation;movie projector;multiplexing;photometric stereo;quantum illumination;signal processing;structured light;video projector	Ryusuke Sagawa;Yutaka Satoh	2017	2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)	10.1109/CVPR.2017.249	modulation;computer vision;filter (signal processing);spread spectrum;photometric stereo;signal processing;standard illuminant;computer science;artificial intelligence;signal-to-noise ratio;multiplexing	Vision	86.00089816004636	-40.18246198848308	97331

In this paper, we investigate several low-rank beam- forming techniques, and we also propose a new beamformer that we refer to as the indirect dominant mode rejection (IDMR). We analyze the degradation in the output SINR caused by residual cross correlations embedded in the sampled covariance matrix due to low sample support. The IDMR beamformer is based on a parametric estimate of the covariance matrix, in which any cross correlation is canceled out. Simulations reveal that the IDMR beamformer yields a dramatic improvement in output SINR relative to the conjugate gradient (CG), principal component inverse (PCI), and dominant mode rejection (DMR) beamformers. In our investigation of the low-rank CG beamformer, we address the issue of whether the unity gain constraint in the look direction should be enforced a priori via the use of a blocking matrix or effected a posteriori through simple scaling of the beamforming vector. Remarkably, it is proven that the two methods yield exactly the same low-rank beamformer at each and every rank.	beamforming;blocking (computing);computation;computer simulation;conjugate gradient method;cross-correlation;dual modular redundancy;elegant degradation;embedded system;householder transformation;image scaling;interference (communication);principal component analysis;rejection sampling;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;the matrix	Ernesto L.

It is implemented using a surface energy source and an array of geophones placed vertically in a well shaft. The geophysical interpretation of VSP data is greatly facilitated by the use of geophone array processing or beam steering to separate the various wave types and arrival angles. Constraints are placed on the array directional response pattern to force main lobe and null locations to desired positions. The corrective gradient projection method is then used to determine the set of tap weights which minimize received power subject to the pattern constraints. The algorithm is applied to data from a simulated seismogram with crossing events and to data from a synthetic VSP seismogram for a 2-layer model. These results demonstrate that undesired events from a given direction can be effectively attenuated.		A. M. Bisbee;E. A. Quincy;D. J.

By stimulating Hodgkin-Huxley neuron with both high-frequency signal and low-frequency weak signal, its weak signal detection capacity have been investigated under electromagnetic induction effect. Obtained results show that electromagnetic induction causes decreasing of the amplitude of vibrational resonance effect emerging depending on the amplitude of high frequency signal. Also, vibrational resonance phenomenon occurs at smaller amplitudes of high frequency signal in Hodgkin-Huxley neuron which is under electromagnetic induction effect. Finally, it is found that the best detection of the weak signal in a Hodgkin-Huxley neuron under electromagnetic induction effect is realized under an optimal electromagnetic current intensity.	detection theory;hodgkin–huxley model;huxley: the dystopia;neuron;resonance	Veli Baysal;Ergin Yilmaz	2018	2018 26th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)	10.1109/SIU.2018.8404591	artificial intelligence;nuclear magnetic resonance;stochastic resonance;pattern recognition;computer science;hodgkin–huxley model;amplitude;electromagnetic induction;resonance;ac power;phenomenon;neuron	EDA	85.07261854039314	-26.420456533062893	97885

Földvári and Gy. Ács in 1996. After a short survey of older hearing models, they proved that their hearing model is able to describe true hearing experience (critical bandwidth, phase limit frequency). We suppose that the outputs of Zwicker's filters and the nonlinear transformation secured by the nonlinear hearing model is suitable for brain processing. Furthermore, we wish to point out that by realizing this method a very low bit rate vocoder and in addition an efficient speech enhancement can be achieved in cases when signal-to-noise ratio is about 0 dB.	nonlinear system;signal-to-noise ratio;speech enhancement;vocoder	Rudolf Földvári;László Gyimesi	1999			speech recognition;nonlinear system;low bit;speech enhancement;computer science;bandwidth (signal processing)	Mobile	83.07439028899721	-32.6167927385972	97964

The presence of strong local speech and noise and a changing acoustical enclosing may severely impair the performance of the algorithms. Usually additional constraints such as a low signal delay are also requested for real time implementation. We present a hands-free system consisting of a delayless sub- band adaptive filter with a low-delay echo and noise suppression postfilter. All parameters are estimated in the subband domain, whereas the filtering takes place in the time domain. Thus, our system has a significantly lower processing delay than similar proposals. We compare its performance with respect to echo and noise attenuation and speech distortion with a state-of-the-art hands-free system in a simulated car environment.	acoustic cryptanalysis;adaptive filter;algorithm;distortion;echo suppression and cancellation;noise reduction;processing delay;signal processing;speech processing;zero suppression	Kai Steinert;Martin Schönle;Christophe Beaugeant;Tim Fingscheidt	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517911	adaptive filter;computer vision;speech recognition;computer science;noise;speech processing;noise floor	Robotics	84.13245791804579	-33.51616390295884	98441

The system described here attenuates the interference from spatially scattered sources while preserving the desired signal quality in the speech frequency range. A novel method for defining additional constraints within the adaptation process and performing beamforming in parallel across several frequency bands achieves undistorted recording even with slight errors in localizing the speaker. Simulation results show nearly optimal improvement of speech quality in various noisy environments. The algorithm is modified to perform in a real environment by introducing two modes of adaptation that switch according to the speaker activity. The implementation of this modified system demonstrates SNR gain close to that of the original simulated system. It is robust to localization errors and non-ideal environmental effects.	adaptive beamformer;algorithm;beamforming;frequency band;interference (communication);internationalization and localization;microphone;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Sergey Timofeev;Ahmad Bahai;Pravin Varaiya	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - ICASSP '07	10.1109/ICASSP.2007.366404	adaptive filter;speech recognition;noise-canceling microphone;computer science;adaptive beamformer;speech processing;beamforming	Robotics	84.4289218276963	-34.31135129795388	98832

An array microphone would seem ideal for this purpose, since theoretically it can be aimed anywhere within the room. However, microphone pattern beamwidth is related to wavelength and aperture size. For a fixed-size aperture, as wavelength goes down so does beamwidth. The change in beamwidth over a decade change in wavelength would seem to be unacceptable for this application. We discuss the design of a constant beamwidth array microphone for the frequency range 300 to 3000 Hz. Because the microphone-to-talker distance is assumed to be about 3 ft while the array has a 9-ft aperture, the microphone is optimized for near field. We also discuss the use of a nonlinear optimization program for choosing the array parameters.	frequency band;mathematical optimization;microphone;near field communication;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system	F.

The estimated model parameters are used to compute time-frequency masks, or estimate second order statistics (SOS) of the source signals. However, in applications with moving sources where the model parameters are time-varying, the batch EM algorithm is inapplicable. We propose an online EM-based clustering of position estimates, where the model parameters are estimated adaptively. A direct-to-diffuse ratio-based speech presence probability is used to detect noisy observations and reduce diffuse and spatially incoherent noise. The desired source signal is extracted by a multichannel Wiener filter computed using SOS estimated from the time-varying model parameters. We show that the signal of a moving source can be extracted, while reducing moving interferers and background noise.	cluster analysis;expectation–maximization algorithm;microphone;variable shadowing;wiener filter	Maja Taseska;Emanuel A.

075c3aeff48ad4d5e78c60decc82314e6db71fe3	a smart-phone based system to detect warning sound for hearing impaired people		Hearing impaired people can not notice warning sounds such as sirens of emergency vehicles, horns of cars, and alarms of railroad crossings and thus can not behave properly. For example, when they walk on the road and an ambulance is approaching, they can not hear the siren and are likely to get into danger. This paper proposes a system to detect a warning sound for a pedestrian. The system detects the warning sounds as following. First, an IIR band pass filter is applied to limit to the frequency band which includes the frequency of warning sounds. Next, an IIR comb filter is applied to remove the the fundamental and the harmonic frequency components of the warning sounds. Finally, threshold processing is conducted for the amplitude ratio of the input signal to the output signal. If the amplitude ratio is below a threshold, the system notifies the user of the existence of the warning sound. This system is simple and easy to implement on smart phones which most people carry commonly every day. We conducted experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. An ambulance siren and noises were synthesized with SNR-10dB, SNR 0dB and SNR 10dB and inputted to the system. The results of this experiment showed that the system can detect an ambulance siren with accuracy above 96% under noisy environments above SNR 0dB. In addition, we conducted an experiment in which an ambulance siren recorded on the road is inputted to the system. We found that the siren affected by the Doppler effect is difficult to be detected by the proposed system.	comb filter;doppler effect;experiment;frequency band;infinite impulse response;shiren the wanderer 2;signal-to-noise ratio;smartphone	Koichiro Takeuchi;Tetsuya Matsumoto;Yoshinori Takeuchi;Hiroaki Kudo;Noboru Ohnishi	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-08599-9_75	acoustics;audiology	HCI	84.85966417102955	-39.48106808578842	99632

There are mainly two methods to obtain TFs: geometrical calculation and measurement. The geometrical calculation has difficulty in simulating robot- and room-acoustics such as diffraction and reflection properties of a robot's body and a room, and the measurement is accurate but time-consuming and requires expertise on acoustics. Thus, we propose fast and simple on-the-spot calibration of TFs including robot- and room-acoustics. The proposed approach first estimates microphone location and clock-difference by Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) using hand clap acoustic signals while a human is walking around a robot. Second, TFs with robot- and room-acoustics are estimated by hand clap acoustic signals and interpolated so that the TFs can be roundly arranged at regular intervals in an online manner. In the evaluation, we calibrated TFs only by 20 hand claps (took only 20 seconds), and the TFs showed considerable improvements in sound source localization and separation compared to geometrically calculated TFs and achieved comparable performance towards the measured TFs which are calibrated by approximately 60 minute recordings.	acoustic cryptanalysis;calibration (statistics);covox speech thing;extended kalman filter;interpolation;microphone;robot;simulation;simultaneous localization and mapping	Keisuke Nakamura;Surya Ambrose;Kazuhiro Nakadai	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139662	estimation;electronic engineering;calibration;speech recognition;acoustics;computer science;engineering;transfer function;statistics;simultaneous localization and mapping	Robotics	86.81704001384095	-35.29634192471508	99952

The proposed method bridges the gap between underdetermined blind source separation techniques and those techniques that model the human auditory system, that is, computational auditory scene analysis (CASA). For this purpose, we decompose the speech signal into the excitation signal and the vocal-tract-related filter and then estimate the components from the mixed speech using a hybrid model. We first express the probability density function (PDF) of the mixed speech’s log spectral vectors in terms of the PDFs of the underlying speech signal’s vocal-tract-related filters. Then, the mean vectors of PDFs of the vocal-tract-related filters are obtained using a maximum likelihood estimator given the mixed signal. Finally, the estimated vocal-tract-related filters along with the extracted fundamental frequencies are used to reconstruct estimates of the individual speech signals. The proposed technique effectively adds vocaltract-related filter characteristics as a new cue to CASA models using a new grouping technique based on an underdetermined blind source separation. We compare our model with both an underdetermined blind source separation and a CASA method. The experimental results show that our model outperforms both techniques in terms of SNR improvement and the percentage of crosstalk suppression.		Mohammad H. Radfar;Richard M.

A disjointness assumption in conventional clustering techniques for BSS is that, at each time-frequency point, observed mixtures consist of a single source only. However, this is not the case in reverberant environments, which causes the performance of the conventional techniques to degrade. To deal with reverberant environments, we introduce a relaxed disjointness assumption: at each time-frequency point, dereverberated mixtures consist of a single source only. Under this assumption, the proposed algorithm alternates dereverberation and clustering-based source separation it-eratively, where clustering is performed on dereverberated mixtures. This algorithm is derived based on maximum a posteriori (MAP) fitting of a probabilistic generative model to observed reverberant mixtures. In experiments, the proposed method outperformed a state-of-the-art clustering technique in terms of a signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) by 0.6-4 dB.	algorithm;blind signal separation;cluster analysis;experiment;generative model;interference (communication);source separation	Nobutaka Ito;Shoko Araki;Takuya Yoshioka;Tomohiro Nakatani	2014	2014 14th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)	10.1109/IWAENC.2014.6954300	electronic engineering;speech recognition;telecommunications;mathematics	AI	83.5010597092767	-36.431208463251515	100313

These two components are combined in a model which synthesizes reproducible artificial wind noise signals. Furthermore, a database of measured wind noise signals is provided. The aim of this model and the measured audio data is to provide wind signals for the evaluation of speech enhancement and noise reduction systems.	database;markov chain;noise reduction;rewriting;simulation;speech enhancement	Christoph Matthias Nelke;Peter Vary	2014	2014 14th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)	10.1109/IWAENC.2014.6954312	gaussian noise;electronic engineering;speech recognition;colors of noise;ambient noise level;acoustics;engineering;noise measurement;noise;background noise;noise floor;noise	ML	87.80549167466444	-34.42331493529546	100591

The method is based on a signal model that takes into account a stereophonic mixture created by mixing multiple individual channels with different pan parameters, and is hence suited for use in automatic music transcription, source separation and classification systems. Panning is done using both amplitude differences and delays. The performance of the estimator is compared to one single-channel, two multi-channel and one multi-pitch estimator using synthetic and real signals. Experiments show that the proposed method is able to correctly estimate the pitches of a mixture of three real signals when they are separated by more than 25 degrees.	experiment;pitch detection algorithm;source separation;synthetic intelligence;transcription (software)	Martin Weiss Hansen;Jesper Rindom Jensen;Mads Græsbøll Christensen	2015	2015 23rd European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)	10.1109/EUSIPCO.2015.7362340	electronic engineering;speech recognition;acoustics;engineering	Vision	83.33158992754419	-35.47359543351243	101690
513615e211957b3585b95a59d396b60895494776	digital terrain modeling with the chebyshev polynomials		Mathematical problems of digital terrain analysis include interpolation of digital elevation models (DEMs), DEM generalization and denoising, and computation of morphometric variables by calculation of partial derivatives of elevation. Traditionally, these procedures are based on numerical treatments of two-variable discrete functions of elevation. We developed a spectral analytical method and algorithm based on high-order orthogonal expansions using the Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind with the subsequent Fejér summation. The method and algorithm are intended for DEM analytical treatment, such as, DEM global approximation, denoising, and generalization as well as computation of morphometric variables by analytical calculation of partial derivatives. To test the method and algorithm, we used a DEM of the Northern Andes including 230,880 points (the elevation matrix 480 × 481). DEMs were reconstructed with 480, 240, 120, 60, and 30 expansion coefficients. The first and second partial derivatives of elevation were analytically calculated from the reconstructed DEMs. Models of horizontal curvature (kh) were then computed with the derivatives. A set of elevation and kh maps related to different number of expansion coefficients well illustrates data generalization effects, denoising, and removal of artifacts contained in the original DEM. The test results demonstrated a good performance of the developed method and algorithm.

This problem cannot be addressed through independent component analysis methods because synchronous sources are statistically dependent. We present a two-step algorithm, called phase locked matrix factorization (PLMF), to perform SSS. We also show that SSS is identifiable under some assumptions and that any global minimum of PLMFs cost function is a desirable solution for SSS. We extensively study the algorithm on simulated data and conclude that it can perform SSS with various numbers of sources and sensors and with various phase lags between the sources, both in the ideal (i.e., perfectly synchronous and nonnoisy) case, and with various levels of additive noise in the observed signals and of phase jitter in the sources.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;blast phase;independent component analysis;loss function;maxima and minima;utility functions on indivisible goods;sensor (device);synovial sarcoma	Miguel S.

However, motion noise in measured ECGs can degrade R peak detection. To reduce noise, properties of reference signal and ECG measured by the sensors are analyzed and a new method of active noise cancellation (ANC) is proposed in this study. In the proposed algorithm, the original ECG signal at QRS interval is regarded as impulsive noise because the adaptive filter updates its weight as if impulsive noise is added. As the proposed algorithm does not affect impulsive noise, the original signal is not reduced during ANC. Therefore, the proposed algorithm can conserve the power of the original signal within the QRS interval and reduce only the power of noise at other intervals. The proposed algorithm was verified through comparisons with recent research using data from both indoor and outdoor experiments. The proposed algorithm will benefit a noise reduction of noisy biomedical signal measured from sensors.	adaptive filter;algorithm;experiment;noise reduction;noise-induced hearing loss;sensor (device)	Minseok Seo;Minho Choi;Jun Seong Lee;Sang Woo Kim	2018		10.3390/s18072086	capacitive sensing;electronic engineering;engineering;noise reduction	EDA	85.52044192558056	-39.69687861291577	102078

e5824308e56ba9aa8ddca64be4be435272eaf0eb	amplitude modulated video camera - light separation in dynamic scenes		Controlled light conditions improve considerably the performance of most computer vision algorithms. Dynamic light conditions create varying spatial changes in color and intensity across the scene. These condition, caused by a moving shadow for example, force developers to create algorithms which are robust to such variations. We suggest a computational camera which produces images that are not influenced by environmental variations in light conditions. The key insight is that many years ago, similar difficulties were already solved in radio communication, As a result each channel is immune to interference from other radio channels. Amplitude Modulated (AM) video camera separates the influence of a modulated light from other unknown light sources in the scene, Causing the AM video camera frame to appear the same - independent of the light conditions in which it was taken. We built a prototype of the AM video camera by using off the shelf hardware and tested it. AM video camera was used to demonstrate color constancy, shadow removal and contrast enhancement in real time. We show theoretically and empirically that: 1. the proposed system can produce images with similar noise levels as a standard camera. 2. The images created by such camera are almost completely immune to temporal, spatial and spectral changes in the background light.	algorithm;computation;computational photography;computer vision;interference (communication);merge sort;modulation;pixel;prototype;smartphone;source separation;warez	Amir Kolaman;Maxim Lvov;Rami R.

The second block includes the acoustical channel and uplink transducers which are assumed to be linear and have a comparatively longer impulse response and higher time variability. The second contribution is a new non-linear adaptive echo canceler which is based on the cascaded model and has greater robustness to changes in the acoustic channel than an existing power filter approach.	acoustic cryptanalysis;acoustic model;echo suppression and cancellation;heart rate variability;loudspeaker enclosure;microphone;multiple encryption;nonlinear system;telecommunications link;transducer	Moctar Mossi Idrissa;Christelle Yemdji;Nicholas W.

Only one discrepancy still exists and cannot yet be completely explained. In this paper, we summarize results of tests that relate to the perfection of the crystals used. With high probability, it turns out that imperfections of the crystal material itself and not the uncertainties of the measurement procedures are responsible fur this inconsistency. At present, the lack of exact knowledge of the degree of crystallographic perfection and, in particular, of the isotopic composition, hampers the progress of the crystal route for a new definition of the kilogram.	avogadro	Peter Becker;Ulrich Kuetgens;J.

f3e4bc59566580fdbd00df21fdf1b7e4b152aa3e	let it bee - towards nmf-inspired audio mosaicing		A swarm of bees buzzing “Let it be” by the Beatles or the wind gently howling the romantic “Gute Nacht” by Schubert – these are examples of audio mosaics as we want to create them. Given a target and a source recording, the goal of audio mosaicing is to generate a mosaic recording that conveys musical aspects (like melody and rhythm) of the target, using sound components taken from the source. In this work, we propose a novel approach for automatically generating audio mosaics with the objective to preserve the source’s timbre in the mosaic. Inspired by algorithms for non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), our idea is to use update rules to learn an activation matrix that, when multiplied with the spectrogram of the source recording, resembles the spectrogram of the target recording. However, when applying the original NMF procedure, the resulting mosaic does not adequately reflect the source’s timbre. As our main technical contribution, we propose an extended set of update rules for the iterative learning procedure that supports the development of sparse diagonal structures in the activation matrix. We show how these structures better retain the source’s timbral characteristics in the resulting mosaic.	activation function;algorithm;iterative method;ncsa mosaic;non-negative matrix factorization;sparse matrix;spectrogram;swarm	Jonathan Driedger;Thomas Prätzlich;Meinard Müller	2015			iterative learning control;speech recognition;machine learning;artificial intelligence;matrix decomposition;computer science;diagonal;matrix (mathematics);spectrogram;timbre;non-negative matrix factorization	ML	83.9906165385513	-37.287261794076365	105225

d1b5490226700d513311570a0f5fe2eb664a8924	sparse gaussian process audio source separation using spectrum priors in the time-domain		Gaussian process (GP) audio source separation is a timedomain approach that circumvents the inherent phase approximation issue of spectrogram based methods. Furthermore, through its kernel, GPs elegantly incorporate prior knowledge about the sources into the separation model. Despite these compelling advantages, the computational complexity of GP inference scales cubically with the number of audio samples. As a result, source separation GP models have been restricted to the analysis of short audio frames. We introduce an efficient application of GPs to time-domain audio source separation, without compromising performance. For this purpose, we used GP regression, together with spectral mixture kernels, and variational sparse GPs. We compared our method with LD-PSDTF (positive semi-definite tensor factorization), KL-NMF (Kullback-Leibler non-negative matrix factorization), and IS-NMF (Itakura-Saito NMF). Results show that the proposed method outperforms these techniques.	aac-ld;approximation;calculus of variations;computational complexity theory;gaussian process;global positioning system;itakura–saito distance;kullback–leibler divergence;non-negative matrix factorization;semiconductor industry;source separation;sparse matrix;spectrogram	Pablo A.

Exceeding from the admissible level of solanine in potatoes, which is 200 mg kg−1 fresh weight of potato, would cause poison hazards in human beings. Herein, we propose a laser light-based non-destructive technique to recognize only α-solanine toxicant in potatoes. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis is also performed as a destructive and reference test to verify the laser light backscattering imaging (LLBI) technique. The single layer perceptron neural networks have been used to classify healthy and toxic potatoes from each other. The results demonstrated that artificial neural networks (ANNs) classified potatoes of cv. ‘Donald’ and ‘Ceasar’ with the accuracy of 98.66% and 99.16% and mean square error (MSE) of 0.013 and 0.003, respectively. Little is known about LLBI systems and development of this new technique is needed in agriculture and food industry.

In pursuit of an autonomous, online and adaptive template learning system in this work, we specifically focus on eliminating the requirement of an offline training session performed in advance to build the essential templates, which represent the ego noise. The idea of discriminating ego noise from all other sound sources in the environment enables the robot to learn the templates online without requiring any prior information. Based on the directionality/diffuseness of the sound sources, the robot can easily decide whether the template should be discarded because it is corrupted by external noises, or it should be inserted into the database because the template consists of pure ego noise only. Furthermore, we aim to update the template database optimally by introducing an additional time-variant forgetting factor parameter, which provides a balance between adaptivity and stability of the learning process automatically. Moreover, we enhanced the single-channel noise estimation system to be compatible with the multi-channel robot audition framework so that ego noise can be eliminated from all signals stemming from multiple sound sources respectively. We demonstrate that the proposed system allows the robot to have the ability of online template learning as well as a high performance of noise estimation and suppression for multiple sound sources.	algorithm;automated system recovery;autonomous robot;background process;microsoft outlook for mac;noise (electronics);noise reduction;online and offline;online machine learning;signal-to-noise ratio;stationary process;stemming;zero suppression	Gökhan Ince;Kazuhiro Nakadai;Keisuke Nakamura	2012	2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2012.6385824	robot;mobile robot;computer vision;estimation;speech recognition;computer science;engineering;noise;speech;artificial intelligence	Robotics	85.34382100551613	-34.98199986990061	106555

Specifically, there is no unique solution and solutions do not depend continuously on the data. This is an inverse problem from EEG to dipole source. In this paper we consider a method combining backpropagation neural network (BPNN) with nonlinear least square (NLS) method for source localization. For inverse problem, the BP neural network and the NLS method has its own advantage and disadvantage, so we use the BPNN to supply the initial value to the NLS method and then get the final result, here we select the Powell algorithm to do the NLS calculating. All these work are for the fast and accurate dipole source localization. The main purpose of using this combined method is to localize two dipole sources when they are locating at the same region of the brain. The following investigations are presented to show that this combined method used in this paper is an advanced approach for two dipole sources localization with high accuracy and fast calculating.	electroencephalography	Zhuoming Li;Yu Zhang;Qinyu Zhang;Masatake Akutagawa;Hirofumi Nagashino;Fumio Shichijo;Yohsuke Kinouchi	2005		10.1007/11508069_23	internationalization and localization;uncertainty;electroencephalography;computer science;inverse problem;artificial intelligence;backpropagation;central nervous system;machine learning;calculus;mathematics;electric current;non-linear least squares;least squares;initial value problem;cerebro;artificial neural network;algorithm;statistics	Robotics	90.11683755049876	-38.922457717919535	106845

Inspired by equalization-cancelation considered in binaural hearing, the target speech is canceled at both left and right ears by means of the FLMS (fast least-mean square) algorithm. Assuming the ideal equalization, the output error of the blocking filter is a biased estimation of noise PSD. The estimated noise PSD is further corrected by exploiting the estimated left and right interaural transfer functions and the coherence model of the noise field. In addition to noise power estimation assessment, the estimated noise PSD is integrated in a binaural speech enhancement framework in order to evaluate the overall noise reduction performance.	algorithm;binaural beats;blocking (computing);mean squared error;noise power;noise reduction;spectral density;speech enhancement	Masoumeh Azarpour;Gerald Enzner;Rainer Martin	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6854971	speech recognition;computer science	EDA	83.53294413798649	-34.167601679694926	106945

A sphere is shown to be a suitable standard object because its behavior describes, to within multiplicative constants, objects of arbitrary conductivity and permeability. Static sensitivity maps take full account of both the excitation and detection coil shapes. They are compact, easy to understand, closely related to industrial testing procedures, and likely to prove a useful design tool. Their usefulness is illustrated by examples based on a metal detector for which published data exist.	map	Peter P. Silvester;Dzevat Omeragic	1996	IEEE Trans.

While phase correct synthesis is ensured over the whole listening area, amplitude deviations are present besides a predefined reference curve. So far, the existence and potential shapes of this reference curve was not extensively discussed in the Wave Field Synthesis literature. This paper introduces improved driving functions for 2.5D Wave Field Synthesis. The novel driving functions allow for the control of the locations of amplitude correct synthesis for arbitrarily shaped-possibly curved-secondary source distributions. This is achieved by deriving an expressive physical interpretation of the stationary phase approximation leading to the presented unified Wave Field Synthesis framework. The improved solutions are better suited for practical applications.

The effect of background noise in these methods is regarded as additive and that of reverberation is convolutive. Therefore, methods of reducing noise and dereverberation have been applied separately in tandem. We previously unified the effects of noise and reverberation in the modulation transfer function (MTF) concept and we proposed an approach to simultaneously removing the effects of noise and reverberation. This paper further verifies our proposed approach, mathematically and quantitatively. In addition, we generalized the model to four types of real application scenarios, which corresponded to far and near field conditions under noisy reverberant conditions, based on mathematical analysis. We carried out 12,000 simulations for each according to the four application scenarios for denoising and dereverberating noisy reverberant speech, and objectively evaluated the proposed approach. The experimental results revealed that the proposed approach worked well in simultaneously denoising and dereverberating noisy reverberant speech.	circuit restoration;modulation;near field communication;noise reduction;simulation;speech enhancement;transfer function;utility functions on indivisible goods	Masashi Unoki;Xugang Lu	2012	2012 8th International Symposium on Chinese Spoken Language Processing	10.1109/ISCSLP.2012.6423499	speech recognition;acoustics;reverberation;linguistics;intelligibility	EDA	84.06427018197044	-35.222803414975196	107867

Our method is based on the modeling of the acoustic paths (direct and reflected) from each of the loudspeakers of the rendering system, and a set of control points in the listening area. From such models we derive a propagation matrix and compute its least-squares inversion. Due to its relevant impact on the spatial impression, we focus on the early reflections part of the Room Impulse Response, which is conveniently estimated using the fast beam tracing modeling engine. A least squares problem is formulated in order to derive the compensation filter.

10bc450dd2bf4d21d80458c744809023ac1228e1	a binaural short time objective intelligibility measure for noisy and enhanced speech		Objective intelligibility measures are increasingly being used to assess the performance of speech processing algorithms, e.g. for hearing aids. It has been shown that the short time objective intelligibility (STOI) measure yields good results in this respect. In this paper we propose a binaural extension of the STOI measure, which predicts binaural advantage using a modified equalization cancellation (EC) stage. The proposed method is evaluated for a range of acoustic conditions. Firstly, the method is able to predict the advantage of spatial separation between a speech target and a speech shaped noise (SSN) interferer. Secondly, the method yields results comparable to the monaural STOI measure when presented with noisy speech processed by ideal time-frequency segregation (ITFS). Finally, the method also performs well when presented with a selection of different acoustic conditions combined with beamforming as used in hearing aids.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;beamforming;binaural beats;dmz (computing);instructional television fixed service;intelligibility (philosophy);speech processing	Asger Heidemann Andersen;Jan Mark de Haan;Zheng-Hua Tan;Jesper Jensen	2015			speech recognition;intelligibility	ML	84.1713621059515	-34.77010570162386	108439

After the position of a speaker is estimated by a speaker tracking system, we construct a subbanddomain beamformer in generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC) configuration. In contrast to conventional practice, we then optimize the active weight vectors of the GSC so that the distribution of an output signal is as non-Gaussian as possible. We consider kurtosis in order to measure the degree of non-Gaussianity. Our beamforming algorithms can suppress noise and reverberation without the signal cancellation problems encountered in conventional beamforming algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed techniques through a series of farfield automatic speech recognition experiments on the MultiChannel Wall Street Journal Audio Visual Corpus (MC-WSJAV). The beamforming algorithm proposed here achieved a 13.6% WER, whereas the simple delay-and-sum beamformer provided a WER of 17.8%.	algorithm;beamforming;experiment;gsc bus;speech recognition;the wall street journal;tracking system;word error rate	Ken'ichi Kumatani;John W.

We introduce a method of reproducing a multizone soundfield within a desired region in reverberant environments. It is based on the identification of the acoustic transfer function (ATF) from the loudspeaker over the desired reproduction region using a limited number of microphone measurements. We assume that the soundfield is sparse in the domain of planewave decomposition and identify the ATF using sparse methods. The estimates of the ATFs are then used to derive the optimal least-squares solution for the loudspeaker filters that minimize the reproduction error over the entire reproduction region. Simulations confirm that the method leads to a significantly reduced number of required microphones for accurate multizone sound reproduction, while it also facilitates the reproduction over a wide frequency range. Practical experiments are used to verify the sparse planewave representation of the reverberant soundfield in a real-world listening environment.	acoustic cryptanalysis;basis function;computer simulation;dvd region code;experiment;frequency band;function model;least squares;loudspeaker;microphone;signal processing;sparse approximation;sparse matrix;transfer function	Wenyu Jin;W.

In this paper, an acoustic-based lane detection approach is introduced for a multilane traffic monitoring system. First, a microphone array is designed according to a typical Chinese highway configuration. The design is based on the cross-array structure, and the cross-correlation matrix from the two subarrays in the selected working frequency band is calculated for the subsequent traffic monitoring operations. Then, a cross section across the road is constructed by beamforming, in which the single-source assumption can be applied, and the passing vehicle azimuth is detected by the proposed rank-1 Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm. Finally, a Parzen-window-based technique is proposed to estimate the vehicle azimuth probability density function (pdf) from the individual azimuth observations. Lane centers and boundaries can be revealed from the peak and valley patterns of the estimated pdf. A prototype traffic monitoring system is developed, and several lane detection approaches are compared in both simulated and real-world environments in the developed system framework. The experimental results exhibit the efficiency of the proposed approach.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;beamforming;computational complexity theory;covox speech thing;cross section (geometry);cross-correlation;direction of arrival;experiment;frequency band;image resolution;java;kernel density estimation;left 4 dead 2;music (algorithm);microphone;online algorithm;portable document format;prototype;radar;sensor web;website monitoring;window function	Yueyue Na;Yanmeng Guo;Qiang Fu;Yonghong Yan	2016	IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems	10.1109/TITS.2016.2521661	speech recognition;telecommunications;engineering;sound	Robotics	83.90924334766729	-41.83692485284759	109266

a81ba3aa3c572040abd390ea86041c766b4c08b3	a photoplethysmographic signal isolated from an additive motion artifact by frequency translation		Acquiring a precise percentage of oxygen saturation (SpO2) from a finger-probe pulse oximeter is dependent on both artifact-free red and infrared photoplethysmoghaphic (PPG) signals. Nonetheless, in real-life situations, these PPG signals are corrupted by a motion artifact (MA) signal that is generated from either finger or hand movement. To resolve this MA interference, the cause of the adulteration of PPG signals by the MA signal is examined. The MA signal is found to behave like an additive noise. Additionally, the frequency responses of the MA and PPG signals show that these signals are in the same frequency band. Hence, instead of direct current, a sinusoidal wave alternating current is proposed to drive an LED source in order to shift the PPG frequency band away from the MA frequency band. Experimentally, a commercial finger-probe pulse oximeter is employed. To determine the performance of the presented scheme, the resulting PPG signals are compared with those from employing the old-fashioned LED-driving method. In addition, the accuracy is verified by computing the SpO2 value. The results reveal that the proposed approach successfully retains the fundamental morphologies of the PPG structures when motion occurs. Moreover, the calculated SpO2 values from the proposed technique provide an average error of approximately 1.4%, whereas the conventional method yields a mean error approximately 4.2%.	additive model;additive white gaussian noise;artifact (error);computation (action);cumulative trauma disorders;experiment;frequency band;frequency response;heterodyne;interference (communication);oxygen saturation test result;real life;utility functions on indivisible goods	Sakkarin Sinchai;Pattana Kainan;Paramote Wardkein;Jeerasuda Koseeyaporn	2018	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems	10.1109/TBCAS.2018.2829708	electronic engineering;infrared;alternating current;frequency band;direct current;computer science;interference (wave propagation);pulse (signal processing);mean squared error;sine wave	Visualization	85.17153601214264	-39.56096367014968	111527

TOPS performs well at mid signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range, but fares poorly at high SNR and noise-free cases. The TOPS pseudospectrum often exhibits spurious peaks at all SNR levels. This paper attempts to explain the cause of poor performance, and proposes suitable modifications to extend the effectiveness of TOPS from low SNR to noise-free case. The proposed modified-TOPS (mTOPS) achieves reduction in spurious peaks by incorporating signal-subspace projection instead of null-space projection used in TOPS. It also uses trace as performance metric, instead of loss of rank used in TOPS. The effectiveness of mTOPS has been studied via simulations.	algorithm;direction of arrival;kernel (linear algebra);pseudospectrum;signal subspace;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;tops	Arnab K.

46c5deabec6c2758ebbd36ae96d8e8253e5dd5a4	personal audio loudspeaker array as a complementary tv sound system for the hard of hearing	beamforming	SUMMARY A directional array radiator is presented, the aim of which is to enhance the sound of the television in a particular direction and hence provide a volume boost to improve speech intelligibility for the hard of hearing. The sound radiated by the array in other directions is kept low, so as not to increase the reverberant level of sound in the listening room. The array uses 32 loudspeakers, each of which are in phase-shift enclosures to generate hypercardioid directivity, which reduces the radiation from the back of the array. The loudspeakers are arranged in 8 sets of 4 loudspeakers, each set being driven by the same signal and stacked vertically, to improve the directivity in this plane. This creates a 3D beamformer that only needs 8 digital filters to be made superdirective. The performance is assessed by means of simulations and measurements in anechoic and reverberant environments. The results show how the array obtains a high directivity in a reverberant environment.	beamforming;digital filter;in-phase and quadrature components;intelligibility (philosophy);loudspeaker;simulation;sound card;spike directivity;television	Marcos F.

Despite the fact that the filter configuration is fixed, each replication experiences different spectral filtering. The radar carrier is detected by observing the energetic fluctuations in a low rate detector. The RF information is extracted by positioning a low rate tunable filter at the detected carrier frequency.	carrier frequency;filter bank;finite impulse response;information extraction;modulation;radar;radio frequency	Zeev Zalevsky;Amir Shemer;Vardit Eckhouse;David Mendlovic;Shlomo Zach	2004	Proceedings of the 2004 11th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems, 2004.

It is based on the use of algorithms of (generalized) deconvolution for correcting spectrometric data, i.e., compensating for the instrumental effects and natural bandwidth effects distorting those data. Among many sophisticated methods currently used for this purpose, no one method is able to properly deal with the irregularities in the data such as the variable shape of peaks of which the interpreted spectrum is composed. In this paper, a flexible and efficient algorithm of generalized deconvolution is proposed, viz. an adaptive rational filter. It is proven to satisfactorily solve this problem by recursive adaptation of its parameters to the widths of the consecutive peaks of which the interpreted spectrum is composed, as well as to the relative distances between peaks along the wavelength axis.

However, there is no standard method for behavioral (black-box) evaluation of fingerprint readers in operational settings where variations in finger placement by the user are encountered. The goal of this research is to design and fabricate 3D targets for repeatable behavioral evaluation of fingerprint readers. 2D calibration patterns with known characteristics (e.g., sinusoidal gratings of pre-specified orientation and frequency, and fingerprints with known singular points and minutiae) are projected onto a generic 3D finger surface to create electronic 3D targets. A state-of-the-art 3D printer (Stratasys Objet350 Connex) is used to fabricate wearable 3D targets with materials similar in hardness and elasticity to the human finger skin. The 3D printed targets are cleaned using 2M NaOH solution to obtain evaluation-ready 3D targets. Our experimental results show that: 1) features present in the 2D calibration pattern are preserved during the creation of the electronic 3D target; 2) features engraved on the electronic 3D target are preserved during the physical 3D target fabrication; and 3) intra-class variability between multiple impressions of the physical 3D target is small. We also demonstrate that the generated 3D targets are suitable for behavioral evaluation of three different (500/1000 ppi) PIV/Appendix F certified optical fingerprint readers in the operational settings.	2d computer graphics;3d computer graphics;3d printing;black box;elasticity (data store);fingerprint recognition;minutiae;printer (computing);simulation;spatial variability;wearable computer;white box (software engineering)	Sunpreet S.

A broadband beamforming microphone array allows for natural integration with sub-band speech recognition as the beamformer is typically implemented as a combination of band-limited sub-arrays. In this paper, rather than recombining the sub-array outputs to give a single enhanced output, we propose the fusion of separate hidden Markov models trained on each subarray frequency band. In addition, a dynamic sub-band weighting scheme is proposed in which the crossand auto-spectral densities of the microphone array inputs are used to estimate the reliability of each frequency band. The microphone array sub-band system is evaluated on an isolated digit recognition task and compared to the standard full-band approach. The results of the proposed dynamic weighting scheme are compared to those obtained using both fixed equal sub-band weights, as well as optimal sub-band weights calculated froma priori knowledge of the correct results.	bandlimiting;beamforming;frequency band;hidden markov model;markov chain;microphone;speech recognition	Iain McCowan;Sridha Sridharan	2001		10.1109/ICASSP.2001.940798	a priori and a posteriori;speech recognition;noise-canceling microphone;computer science;spectral density;hidden markov model	ML	83.00452695582985	-34.665728066476625	114303

This transformation has been applied to general cross-correlation and steered response power algorithms; the latter has been shown to be more robust. For a multiple known number of sources, both algorithms have problems separating the sources that are close together because of the limitation caused by the resolution. Recently, an approach was made using simple well-known statistical room acoustics to model room reverberation, and another parametric approach called the approximate maximum likelihood was made that was designed for multi-source estimations. By combining these methods, we developed an ML algorithm that is suitable for multi-source target estimates in a reverberant room.	approximation algorithm;convergence insufficiency;cross-correlation;data model;direction of arrival;image resolution;multi-source	Andreas M.

Periodic movement of human torso caused by respiration and heart beat induces fundamental frequencies and their harmonics at the respiration and heart rates. IR-UWB enables capture of these spectral components and frequency domain processing enables a low cost implementation. Most existing methods of identifying the fundamental component either in frequency or time domain to estimate the HR and/or RR lead to significant error if the fundamental is distorted or cancelled by interference. The SHAPA algorithm (1) takes advantage of the HR harmonics, where there is less interference, and (2) exploits the information in previous spectra to achieve more reliable and robust estimation of the fundamental frequency in the spectrum under consideration. Example experimental results for HR estimation demonstrate how our algorithm eliminates errors caused by interference and produces 16% to 60% more valid estimates.	algorithm;blinded;estimated;hyperacute pancreatic cancer vaccine;interference (communication);radar;rapid refresh;real-time clock;respiratory rate;round-robin scheduling;time series;trunk structure;ultra-wideband;vital signs;heart rate	Van Chi Nguyen;Abdul Qadir Javaid;Mary Ann Weitnauer	2014	2014 36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/EMBC.2014.6944065	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	84.64104504599969	-40.92381997699468	115067

The method is based on computing the zero-crossings rate (ZCR) of the AEC output and comparing it against a suitably-chosen threshold. As the ZCR values falls below the threshold, double talk is declared and the AEC filter adaptation is either slowed down or halted. The zero crossings are very easy to compute by observing the sign changes of two consecutive samples from the output of the AEC. In contrast to most existing methods, the computational burden of the proposed method is minimal and it can, therefore, be conveniently implemented on a low-power, low-resource processor. This computational simplicity is enjoyed without sacrificing for any AEC performance. We will illustrate effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing against the existing state of the art and present guidelines on choosing parameters for computing the sample-by-sample ZCR.	acoustic cryptanalysis;computation;digital signal processor;discriminant;echo suppression and cancellation;low-power broadcasting;neural correlates of consciousness;tor messenger;whole earth 'lectronic link;zero-crossing rate	Muhammad Z.

f1a2aa49c0ad0651a9011ea519261936dd9104e6	altitude measurement of low-elevation target for vhf radar based on weighted sparse bayesian learning		In this study, a novel method is proposed to deal with the problem of altitude measurement of a low-elevation target for very high frequency radars in complex terrains. The problem typically concerns about the direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation method for closely spaced and correlated signals arose by multipath propagation, in which the multipath signal would be modulated by the rough and irregular reflecting surface, result in amplitude and phase perturbation and energy fluctuations of the receiving signals. A perturbation multipath propagation model is derived where the influence of irregular reflecting in complex terrain is taken as a random perturbation of the multipath signal. The spatial sparsity of the receiving signal is then exploited, and a weighted sparse Bayesian learning method is proposed to estimate both the random perturbation coefficients and DOA of the incident signal with high precision. Both the computer simulations and real data analysis indicate the efficiency and superior performance of the proposed method in dealing with altitude measurement in complex terrain.	radar;sparse matrix	Cunxu Li;Baixiao Chen;Minglei Yang;Yisong Zheng	2018	IET Signal Processing	10.1049/iet-spr.2016.0738	algorithm;terrain;mathematics;multipath propagation;elevation;control theory;radar;artificial intelligence;phase perturbation;perturbation (astronomy);altitude;pattern recognition;bayesian inference	Robotics	84.57951679364432	-42.63652908669102	115576

In order to reflect the scaling relation between the sample spectrum and scaling spectrum, the proposed method uses scaling vector rather than scaling factor which is usually used in the traditional spectral subtraction model. As independent of reference peak, the method can deal with most of subtraction cases of binary mixtures. For multiple system with unknown scaling spectrum, ei-genspectra method is introduced to calculate the accurate scaling spectra. Experimental results show that difference spectra can match the real spectra well. Besides, in contrast to the results of traditional method, difference spectra obtained by this method is more similar with the real spectra. The prediction results based on partial least squares (PLS) model demonstrate that the performance of difference spectra is better than that of sample spectra in characteristic regions.	image scaling;partial least squares regression;rca spectra 70	Chaoling Yang;Silong Peng;Qiong Xie;Jiangtao Peng;Jipin Wei;Yong Hu	2011	2011 4th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics (BMEI)	10.1109/BMEI.2011.6098621	spectrum;infrared spectroscopy;infrared;fourier transform spectroscopy;mathematics;predictive modelling;optics;least squares;quantum mechanics;statistics	Vision	82.95522926185697	-48.15144033537153	116240

A conditional data likelihood model based on a measurement hypothesis is proposed and implemented using particles. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is capable of localizing the positions of multiple sources with a small number of microphones without any prior knowledge when the amount of reverberation is moderate.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;microphone;simulation	Yeongseon Lee;Ted S.

d7bd26e15ae84740abe93b87b852c7a555b4b48a	echo cancellation for bone conduction transducers	acoustic echo cancellation;bone conduction transducers	Bone conducting transducers are attractive technologies for voice communication systems. Bone vibrators (BVs), typically located on the condyle bone, allow users to listen while leaving their outer ears open, enhancing situational awareness. Meanwhile, bone conduction microphones (BCMs), often located on the temple, increase the transmitted signal to noise ratio because they are relatively insensitive to ambient airborn environmental noise. A communication headset consisting of a BV and a BCM is a natural combination of these promising technologies. The prospect of acoustic coupling between the BVs and BCMs results in acoustic echo if full-duplex communication is used. To our knowledge, such a bone conducting echo path has yet to be characterized. Here, the echo path's linearity, stationarity, and time span are investigated and an echo canceller using bon conducting transducers is presented.	acoustic coupler;acoustic cryptanalysis;bone scintigraphy;duplex (telecommunications);echo suppression and cancellation;headset (audio);microphone;signal-to-noise ratio;stationary process;transducer	Mohammadhossein Behgam;Steven L.

The problem can be solved even under noisy conditions by exploiting characteristics of speech and noise signals. However, when more speakers are active simultaneously, these methods are generally unreliable, since multiple speech signals may overlap completely in the time-frequency plane. Here, a new approach is suggested which is applicable in multi-speaker scenarios also, owing to its incorporation of higher order statistics. Here, independent component analysis is used to obtain estimates of the clean speech and the angles of incidence for each speaker. Subsequently, these estimates can help to correctly identify the active speaker and perform voice activity detection. The suggested approach is robust to noise as well as to interfering speech and can detect the presence of single speakers in mixtures of speech and noise, even under highly reverberant conditions at 0dB SIR.	algorithm;error message;exploit (computer security);incidence matrix;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;powered speakers;preprocessor;source separation;speech recognition;voice activity detection	S.

Most GPR equipment covers a frequency range between an octave and a decade by using short-time pulses. Each signal recorded by a GPR gathers a temporal log of attenuated and distorted versions of these pulses (due to the effect of the propagation medium) plus possible electromagnetic interferences and noise. In order to make a good interpretation of this data and extract the most possible information during processing, a deep knowledge of the wavelet emitted by the antennas is essential. Moreover, some advanced processing techniques require specific knowledge of this signal to obtain satisfactory results. In this work, we carried out a series of tests in order to determine the source wavelet emitted by a ground-coupled antenna with a 500 MHz central frequency.	antenna device component;audio signal processing;frequency band;gram-positive rods (bacteria);head injuries, penetrating;kriging;megahertz;software propagation;ultra-wideband;version;waveform;wavelet	Fernando I.

Non-destructive evaluation using ultrasonic signals is a well-established method to obtain physically relevant parameters to characterize damages in isotropic homogeneous materials. However, ultrasonic signals obtained from composites require special care in signal interpretation due to their structural complexity. In this paper, some enhancements on the interpretation are done by adapting classical parametrization techniques to extract relevant features from the ultrasonic signals. Thus, a cepstral-based feature extractor is firstly designed and optimized by using a classification system based on cepstral distances. Then, this feature extractor is applied in an analysis-by-synthesis scheme which, by using a numerical model of the specimen, infers the values of the damage parameters.	biological specimen;cepstrum;mathematical model;numerical analysis;optical fiber;randomness extractor;speech coding	Nicolas Bochud;Ángel M.

The basis is the combination of an acoustic echo canceller and an adaptive gain control method. The paper describes how the effect of the echo canceller can be optimized without increasing the computational expense. This is achieved by extending the length of the adaptive filter at the cost of a reduced affected frequency range. The study shows to which extent one can concentrate on the low frequency portion of the acoustic echoes in a wide-band application, if a suitable additional gain control method is available. The optimization is accomplished using a simple room model. Real-time measurements were carried out using an implementation of the complete hands-free system on a single DSP.	acoustic cryptanalysis;echo suppression and cancellation	Peter Heitkämper	1995		10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479488	adaptive filter;automatic gain control;adaptive control;telecommunications;computer science;speech processing;low frequency;telephony	Robotics	84.15995344789742	-33.23987742803505	123083
95330584bc1364087ba16dbe7916eb42eb919355	acoustic holography — a robot application		Acoustic holography is a technique to visualize the sound field propagating from a sound source. It is used to analyse and locate sources of noise, and even allows to predict the propagation of sound in the environment. However, this technique involves simultaneous measurements of up to 256 microphones, arranged in an array. We propose an alternative approach with 4 or less microphones which are re-positioned using an articulated robot arm. Provided the measurement conditions are stable, this alternative approach with consecutive measurements allows to make use of acoustic holography to investigate various sources of noise.

The device has been designed for advanced mirror isolation systems of interferometric gravitational wave detectors. The accelerometer consists of a small monolithic folded pendulum with 2 s of natural period and an in-vacuum mechanical quality factor of 3000. The folded pendulum geometry, combined with the monolithic design, allows a unique 0.01% cross-axis residual coupling. Equipped with a high-resolution capacitance position sensor, it is capable of a noise-equivalent inertial displacement of 1-nm root mean square integrated over all the frequencies above 0.01 Hz.

694baa2767ac70d8f202ae2473045952bbb45e02	an iot-based traceability system for greenhouse seedling crops		This paper presents the design of the Internet of Things (IoT)-based greenhouse traceability model for the tracking and recordkeeping of seedlings and other agricultural products in the germination and growth stages. Traced products are generally of high quality and high commercial value, making the voluntary adoption of traceability processes for the market in processed products and trade in fresh products more common today. The transmission of diseases to humans, along with the cases of chemical poisoning, provided the motive for changes in trade relations between the countries and in the manner of assessing consumer safety. The model allows the tracking of variables, such as luminosity, humidity, temperature, and water consumption, thereby revealing overall water use, growth patterns of the plants, and the timeline for harvest of produce. The system enables automated control of the indoor environment of the greenhouse using an irrigation system or temperature control and presents the main outline of internal traceability of agricultural products from seed to final produce. By means of an IoT platform, this greenhouse design finally facilitates a novel analysis of the behavior of a number of species that comprise the local agriculture in one region of Colombia.

Low-complexity RIR methods will become inevitable in next generation communication systems having massive amounts of microphones/loudspeakers. For a room with rigid boundaries, we show that proper sampling of the free-field plenacoustic spectrum results in the solution of the wave equation at any position in the room. We show that the spatial aliasing introduced by spectral sampling represents the wall reflections. These wall reflections are usually modelled, at least in low-complexity simulation algorithms, by the creation of virtual free-field sources outside the room, an image source model commonly referred to as the image method. The image method requires O(N3) operations per receiver position, whereas the newly proposed method requires only O(NlogN) operations per receiver position.	algorithm;aliasing;coefficient;computation;experiment;image impedance;loudspeaker;microphone;next-generation network;open-source software;reflection (computer graphics);sampling (signal processing);series expansion;simulation;voronoi diagram	Jorge Martinez;Richard Heusdens	2010	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2010.2051049	wave equation;speech recognition;telecommunications;computer science	Vision	86.57065616557993	-38.018140132959424	125745

During measurements, spurious frequencies appear on the one hand at 50, 100, 150 Hz but and on the other hand around 83.3, 133.4 and 216.7 Hz. The first ones are due to the mains and that at 216.7 Hz comes from the GSM modulation. We show that the two others (83.3 and 133.4 Hz) are related to the 216.7 Hz component and to the sampling frequency. In order to get rid of these parasitic components, a low-pass filtering is applied before further analysis. A study of the acquisition system behavior in the band [0; 40 Hz] is carried out to conclude on the validity of this analysis.	low-pass filter;mobile phone;modulation;radio frequency;remote control;sampling (signal processing)	E.

Instead of identifying the echo path impulse responses with adaptive filters, the proposed algorithm estimates the echo spectra from the stereo signals using two weighting functions. The spectral modification technique originally proposed for noise reduction is adopted to remove the echo from the microphone signal. Moreover, a priori signal-to-echo ratio (SER) based Wiener filter is used as the gain function to achieve a trade-off between musical noise reduction and computational load for real-time operations.

357d229507a0a293e553fbfa29b4750ccab9336c	joint source localization and dereverberation by sound field interpolation using sparse regularization		In this paper, source localization and dereverberation are formulated jointly as an inverse problem. The inverse problem consists in the interpolation of the sound field measured by a set of microphones by matching the recorded sound pressure with that of a particular acoustic model. This model is based on a collection of equivalent sources creating either spherical or plane waves. In order to achieve meaningful results, spatial, spatio-temporal and spatio-spectral sparsity can be promoted in the signals originating from the equivalent sources. The inverse problem consists of a large-scale optimization problem that is solved using a first order matrix-free optimization algorithm. It is shown that once the equivalent source signals capable of effectively interpolating the sound field are obtained, they can be readily used to localize a speech sound source in terms of Direction of Arrival (DOA) and to perform dereverberation in a highly reverberant environment.	acoustic cryptanalysis;acoustic model;algorithm;covox speech thing;direction of arrival;interpolation;mathematical optimization;microphone;optimization problem;sparse matrix	Niccolo Antonello;Enzo De Sena;Marc Moonen;Patrick A.

This work is aimed at developing a design for the use of a microphone array with binaural hearing aids. The goal of such a hearing aid is to provide both the spatial-filtering benefits of the array and the natural benefits to sound localization ability and speech intelligibility that result from binaural listening. The present study examines a design in which two ear-level omnidirectional microphones constitute the array. The merging of array processing with binaural listening is accomplished by dividing the frequency spectrum, devoting the lowpass part to binaural processing and the highpass part to adaptive array processing. Acoustic and behavioral measurements were made in an anechoic chamber and in a moderately reverberant room to assess the trade-off between sound localization and speech reception as the cutoff frequency was varied. A lowpass/highpass cutoff frequency of 500 Hz provided an improvement of 40 percentage points in sentence intelligibility over unaided listening for normal-hearing listeners, while still allowing adequate localization performance. Comparison of this binaural adaptive system to traditional amplification configurations with normal-hearing listeners showed improvements in speech reception in noise in a mildly reverberant room of approximately 3 dB over simple binaural amplification and 5 dB over monaural amplification.	adaptive system;binaural beats;microphone	Daniel P.

It has been a challenge to encode temporal fine structure (TFS) in cochlear implants for better speech and music perception. We propose a pitch-synchronized coherent demodulation strategy—Harmonic Single Sideband Encoder (HSSE)—to efficiently encode TFS cues. A dynamic carrier estimation approach based on harmonic detection was chosen to enhance temporal pitch coding in cochlear implants. Acoustic analysis results showed that the HSSE strategy preserves temporal fine structure cues including fundamental frequency (F0) information as well. The coding of temporal fine structure cues in cochlear implants could be potentially improved with the F0-synchronized coherent demodulation.	acoustic cryptanalysis;carrier recovery;cochlear implant;coherence (physics);encode;encoder;single-sideband modulation;team foundation server	Xing Li;Kaibao Nie;Les E.

1cd957b8e4a226dbc705f5d493c17425e171e70c	a phase-aware single channel speech enhancement technique using separate bayesian estimators for voiced and unvoiced regions with digital hearing aid application	bayesian estimators;mmse estimator;speech enhancement;digital hearing aid	The modern digital hearing aids suffer from the problem of degradation of perceived signal quality and intelligibility of audio signal when signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the input signal becomes very low. In this work, a speech enhancement algorithm is proposed where the magnitude spectrum of clean speech is estimated by using two separate Bayesian estimators derived from two different cost functions. For the voiced regions, the perceptually motivated adaptive β-order weighted minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator is used and the phase structure of the voiced region is also reconstructed using a harmonic model of speech. On the other hand, for the unvoiced segments, Bayesian estimator with modified Itakura-Saito (MIS) cost function is utilized for estimating the magnitude spectrum of clean unvoiced signal. The proposed algorithm is simulated under different non-stationary noisy environments at various signal to noise ratio values. The experimental results show that the proposed speech enhancement framework performs better than other standard benchmark methods in terms of several quality and intelligibility assessment metrics of perceived audio signal.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);elegant degradation;intelligibility (philosophy);itakura–saito distance;loss function;mean squared error;noise reduction;signal-to-noise ratio;speech enhancement;stationary process	Suman Samui;Indrajit Chakrabarti;Soumya K.

Existing dereverberation methods, including one designed for music, sometimes distort instrument sounds and make staccato-like tones. The problems with the Itakura-Saito-divergence-based formulation of the existing methods are 1) their tendency to excessive suppression of direct sound and 2) the difficulty of incorporating and optimizing sophisticated source models suitable for music signals. The proposed I-divergence-based method can mitigate these problems. Employing the I-divergence measure enables us to avoid the direct sound suppression problem and to use powerful music spectrum models without complicating its optimization. We develop a convergence-guaranteed parameter estimation algorithm based on the auxiliary function approach. Experimental results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed dereverberation method.	algorithm;distortion;estimation theory;itakura–saito distance;mathematical optimization;zero suppression	Naoki Yasuraoka;Hirokazu Kameoka;Takuya Yoshioka;Hiroshi G.

6427ef6f1ad6f2f0a91968cbeb6ede4b6aa42ad3	narrowband passive sonar tracking		Passive sonar sensors are the main source of information for a submerged submarine. Modern sonar systems like ISUS 90 offer a number of acoustic antennas and combined signal processing for broadband and narrowband detection and analysis of target noise. While broadband detection is often used to obtain an overview of the targets surrounding the own ship, narrowband processing enables the detection of target characteristic frequency lines, often produced by vibrations of the propulsion systems on surface ships which are radiated into the water. Narrowband processing is therefore essential for target analysis and classification. Frequency line information can be used to separate targets closely spaced in bearing, e.g. during target crossing situations, which can not be resolved by the broadband passive sonar information alone. In addition, target bearing histories containing frequency line information may be used in the Target Motion Analysis module to infer about target course, speed and range without an own-boat manoeuvre. Therefore, narrowband passive sonar tracking provides an additional valuable source of information and enhances the capabilities of a submarine sonar and combat system. In this paper we present multi-target tracking results for narrowband passive sonar based on a multi-hypothesis tracking approach. The tracking system is designed to automatically track all detectable frequency lines of multiple targets, while at the same time minimizing the number of false tracks.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;information source;normal mode;sonar (symantec);sensor;signal processing;statistical classification;target motion analysis;tracking system	Kevin Brinkmann;Jörg Hurka	2010			acoustics;narrowband;sonar;computer science	Robotics	84.53485977216792	-41.82557816375825	128698

The system employs two parallel GMM classifiers for discriminating screams from noise and gunshots from noise, respectively. Each classifier is trained using different features, chosen from a set of both conventional and innovative audio features. The location of the acoustic source which has produced the sound event is estimated by computing the time difference of arrivals of the signal at a microphone array and using linear-correction least square localization algorithm. Experimental results show that our system can detect events with a precision of 93% at a false rejection rate of 5% when the SNR is 10dB, while the source direction can be estimated with a precision of one degree. A real-time implementation of the system is going to be installed in a public square of Milan.	acoustic cryptanalysis;closed-circuit television;microphone;real-time clock;real-time computing;rejection sampling;scream (cipher);selection algorithm;signal-to-noise ratio	Giuseppe Valenzise;Luigi Gerosa;Marco Tagliasacchi;Fabio Antonacci;Augusto Sarti	2007	2007 IEEE Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance	10.1109/AVSS.2007.4425280	computer vision;contextual image classification;speech recognition;audio signal processing;computer science;multilateration;machine learning;least squares	Robotics	83.90106680555779	-41.68759866612416	128922

8fc057db556446c25a8704847a7eb0cfd3dadccb	mouth-clicks used by blind expert human echolocators – signal description and model based signal synthesis		Echolocation is the ability to use sound-echoes to infer spatial information about the environment. Some blind people have developed extraordinary proficiency in echolocation using mouth-clicks. The first step of human biosonar is the transmission (mouth click) and subsequent reception of the resultant sound through the ear. Existing head-related transfer function (HRTF) data bases provide descriptions of reception of the resultant sound. For the current report, we collected a large database of click emissions with three blind people expertly trained in echolocation, which allowed us to perform unprecedented analyses. Specifically, the current report provides the first ever description of the spatial distribution (i.e. beam pattern) of human expert echolocation transmissions, as well as spectro-temporal descriptions at a level of detail not available before. Our data show that transmission levels are fairly constant within a 60° cone emanating from the mouth, but levels drop gradually at further angles, more than for speech. In terms of spectro-temporal features, our data show that emissions are consistently very brief (~3ms duration) with peak frequencies 2-4kHz, but with energy also at 10kHz. This differs from previous reports of durations 3-15ms and peak frequencies 2-8kHz, which were based on less detailed measurements. Based on our measurements we propose to model transmissions as sum of monotones modulated by a decaying exponential, with angular attenuation by a modified cardioid. We provide model parameters for each echolocator. These results are a step towards developing computational models of human biosonar. For example, in bats, spatial and spectro-temporal features of emissions have been used to derive and test model based hypotheses about behaviour. The data we present here suggest similar research opportunities within the context of human echolocation.

The interference mitigation method introduced in this letter is implemented before any further signal processing. It reconstructs the interference by the exactly estimated frequency, amplitude, and phase parameters in the signal spectrum and then subtracts the artificial interference from the input time-domain complex signal. The procedure steps of the method are illustrated in detail. The data stream of continuous oblique-incident ionospheric detection has been processed effectively and rapidly in real time. Several delay-Doppler ionograms severely contaminated by RFI are selected and presented. Comparisons of the original and mitigated ionograms and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) data show that the RFIs are eliminated perfectly and that the SNR is greatly improved.	frequency band;interference (communication);oblique projection;radio frequency;signal processing;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral density	Gang Chen;Zhengyu Zhao;Guoqiang Zhu;Yujie Huang;Ting Li	2010	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2009.2039340	signal reconstruction;electromagnetic interference;spectrum;ionogram;degradation;telecommunications;time domain;computer science;signal processing;high frequency;ionosphere;hafnium;radio frequency;physics;remote sensing	Arch	83.84693642475558	-42.55717047343465	130523

However, one of the main challenges in coherent detection-based ϕ -OTDR systems is the fading noise, which impacts the detection performance. In addition, typical signal averaging and differentiating techniques are not suitable for detecting high frequency events. This paper presents a new approach for reducing the effect of fading noise in fiber optic distributed acoustic vibration sensing systems without any impact on the frequency response of the detection system. The method is based on temporal adaptive processing of ϕ -OTDR signals. The fundamental theory underlying the algorithm, which is based on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) maximization, is presented, and the efficacy of our algorithm is demonstrated with laboratory experiments and field tests. With the proposed digital processing technique, the results show that more than 10 dB of SNR values can be achieved without any reduction in the system bandwidth and without using additional optical amplifier stages in the hardware. We believe that our proposed adaptive processing approach can be effectively used to develop fiber optic-based distributed acoustic vibration sensing systems.	acoustic cryptanalysis;carrier recovery;decorrelation;dental intrusion;dental whitening;digital data;expectation–maximization algorithm;experiment;eye;fiber optic cables;fiber optic technology;finite impulse response;frequency response;greater than;large;matched filter;noise reduction;optical amplifier;optical fiber;optical fiber cable;optical time-domain reflectometer;parallel computing;passive optical network;preprocessor;processing (action);real-time transcription;sensor;signal averaging;signal-to-noise ratio;super high material cd;time-domain reflectometry;tracing (software);vibration - physical agent;zero suppression;spiromustine	Ibrahim Ölçer;Ahmet Öncü	2017		10.3390/s17061288	fading;engineering;electronic engineering;filter (signal processing);optical time-domain reflectometer;signal averaging;distributed acoustic sensing;fiber optic sensor;frequency response;matched filter	EDA	85.88176355605974	-40.23062570646672	131450
7e6e23d8ef0cd965df406d85fd59b775c3940f3e	2.5d localized sound zone generation with a circular array of fixed-directivity loudspeakers		This paper provides an analytical approach to generating localized sound zone close to loudspeakers in the horizontal plane using a circular array of fixed-directivity loudspeakers and an additional loudspeaker based on sound source dimension mismatch. A circular loudspeaker array and an additional loudspeaker located on the array center are simultaneously produced in mutual opposite phase. As a result, the propagated sound pressure at the reference circle for 2.5-dimensional sound field synthesis is completely cancelled, but that near the circular array is not compensated and localized sound zone generation is realized. The driving signals of the circular array of fixed-directivity loudspeakers and the produced sound pressures are analytically derived. The results of computer simulations indicate the effectiveness of the proposal. By taking the acoustic source-receiver reciprocity into account, the proposed filter coefficients of loudspeakers are also directly used for close-talking microphone array with directional microphones in the horizontal plane.	2.5d;acoustic cryptanalysis;coefficient;computer simulation;covox speech thing;loudspeaker;microphone	Takuma Okamoto	2018	2018 16th International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC)	10.1109/IWAENC.2018.8521366		Arch	86.85552797960025	-35.055703103491986	131493

We extend previous approaches by combining a finite-width bow-string interaction model with a dynamic friction model based on simulating heat diffusion along the width of the bow. Bow hair dynamics are incorporated in the bow-string interaction, which includes two transversal string polarizations. The bridge termination is realized using an efficient, passive digital reflectance matrix obtained from fitting admittance measurements.

The resulting spatial directivity pattern of such a VAH is known to be sensitive to small deviations of the assumed microphone characteristics, e.g., gain, phase and/or the positions of the microphones. In many beamformer design procedures, this sensitivity is reduced by imposing a white noise gain (WNG) constraint on the filter coefficients for a single desired look direction. In this paper, this constraint is shown to be inappropriate for regularizing the HRTF synthesis with multiple desired directions and three alternative different regularization approaches are proposed and evaluated. In the first approach, the measured deviations of the microphone characteristics are taken into account in the filter design. In the second approach, the filter coefficients are regularized using the mean WNG for all directions. The third approach additionally takes into account several frequency bins into both the optimization and the regularization. The different proposed regularization approaches are compared using analytic and measured transfer functions, including random deviations. Experimental results show that the approach using multiple frequency bands mimicking the spectral resolution of the human auditory system yields the best robustness among the considered regularization approaches.	beamforming;coefficient;filter design;frequency band;head-related transfer function;least squares;loss function;mathematical optimization;matrix regularization;microphone;radiation pattern;real life;white noise	Eugen Rasumow;Martin Hansen;Steven van de Par;Dirk Puschel;Volker Mellert;Simon Doclo;Matthias Blau	2016	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing	10.1109/TASLP.2015.2504874	electricity generation;regularization;speech recognition;acoustics;computer science;speech;machine learning;linguistics;white noise;beamforming;statistics;robustness	EDA	84.5876559327087	-35.398661715533414	131629

The method is based on sparseness in the time-frequency representation of speech signal and is applicable to an underdetermined case where the sources outnumber sensors. At first, we introduce a parameterized closed surface to which we refer the phase difference manifold. This is defined in the space of phase difference vectors between sensors in order to provide the one-to-one correspondence between the induced phase difference on this sphere and a propagating direction vector of the source. Instead using the conventional pseudo-inverse mapping algorithm, the selection of phase difference vectors located or closely located on the phase difference manifold as a set of reliable observations. Finally, the author's method utilizing kernel density algorithm is generalized for arbitrary array sensors case. The conducted experiments demonstrate that the method utilizing the reliable cell selection and the kernel density estimator with appropriate bandwidth determination performed effectively.	algorithm;direction finding;direction of arrival;experiment;kernel (operating system);kernel density estimation;neural coding;one-to-one (data model);sensor;time–frequency representation	Ken Fujimoto;Ning Ding;Nozomu Hamada	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288449	mathematical optimization;estimation;kernel;speech recognition;manifold;sensor;speech;pattern recognition;speech processing;mathematics;direction of arrival;variable kernel density estimation;statistics	Robotics	83.95379882704333	-37.01212299416481	131725

Applying these methods to localizing audio sources, however, is challenging due to the wideband nature of the signals. The common approach of processing all frequency bands separately and fusing the results is costly and can introduce errors in the solution. We show how these problems can be overcome by decomposing the wavefield of a circular microphone array and using circular harmonic coefficients instead of time-frequency data for sparse DOA estimation. As a result, we present the superresolution localization method WASCHL (Wideband Audio Sparse Circular Harmonics Localizer) that is inherently frequency-coherent and highly efficient from a computational point of view.	beamforming;coefficient;coherence (physics);computation;direction of arrival;frequency band;microphone;point of view (computer hardware company);sparse matrix;super-resolution imaging	Clemens Hage;Tim Habigt;Martin Kleinsteuber	2014	CoRR		speech recognition;acoustics;sparse approximation	ML	84.80811267330762	-36.7273136052509	133615

Target speech is reconstructed with model parameters estimated from noisy observations. In particular, spectral envelope is estimated by tracking its temporal trajectories in order to improve the noise-distorted short-time spectral amplitude. Initially, we propose an analysis-synthesis framework for speech enhancement based on harmonic noise model (HNM). Acoustic parameters such as pitch, spectral envelope, and spectral gain are extracted from HNM analysis. Spectral envelope estimation is improved by tracking its line spectrum frequency trajectories through Kalman filtering. System identification of Kalman filter is achieved via a combined design of codebook mapping scheme and maximum-likelihood estimator with parallel training data. Complete system design and experimental validations are given in details. Through performance evaluation based on a study of spectrogram, objective measures and a subjective listening test, it is demonstrated that the proposed approach achieves significant improvement over conventional methods in various conditions. A distinct advantage of the proposed method is that it successfully tackles the “musical tones” problem.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;codebook;estimation theory;kalman filter;performance evaluation;pitch (music);spectral density;spectral efficiency;spectrogram;speech enhancement;stellar classification;system identification;systems design	Ruofei Chen;Cheung-Fat Chan;Hing-Cheung So	2012	IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing	10.1109/TASL.2011.2177821	kalman filter;speech recognition;acoustics;computer science;harmonic analysis;pattern recognition;mathematics;maximum likelihood;speech synthesis;statistics	Vision	83.1500981868171	-34.996629935999565	133963

Binaural information such as interaural time difference (ITD) or interaural intensity difference(IID) is effective for horizontal sound localization. In order to extend this ability to vertical sound localization, spectral cues were utilized in this paper instead of increasing number of microphones. Spectral cues were the information about the vertical position of the sound source on frequency domain. Since spectral cues strongly depended on the shape of pinnae, artificial pinnae for auditory robots were designed based on diffraction-reflection model. A method to detect spectral cues was also developed. By utilizing them, a controller which made the robot orient to the sound source was proposed. Results of an experiment showed the validity of the proposed method.	binaural beats;covox speech thing;microphone;robot;servo;stellar classification	Makoto Kumon;Tomoko Shimoda;Ryuichi Kohzawa;Ikuro Mizumoto;Zenta Iwai	2005	2005 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2005.1545092	robot;speech recognition;interaural time difference;acoustics;sound localization;computer science;engineering;perceptual-based 3d sound localization;frequency domain	Robotics	86.40056515780918	-34.692938756272184	134714

In this letter, we propose a modified array interpolation approach by specifying a union of nonoverlapping narrow subsectors as the in-sector to cover only the source locations preestimated roughly on an assumption that at least a single ULSA is available for coherent source localization. Furthermore, we skip noise prewhitening and employ more subarrays of the virtual uniform linear array (VULA) for forward-backward spatial smoothing (FBSS) that plays a key role in noise floor reduction as well as coherent source decorrelation.	coherent;decorrelation;interpolation;neural coding;noise floor;smoothing;sparse matrix	Bo Li;Bin Xu;Yeshu Yuan	2009	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2008.2008950	covariance matrix;mathematical optimization;estimation;field of view;interpolation;noise;multiple signal classification;mathematics;statistics	Vision	86.8177752605256	-38.74907254686539	134897

Detailed numerical calculations are given for various geometries involving an aircraft, sound cancelling sources, reference microphones as well as correction microphones. The calculations are for broadband noise based on a frequency spectrum typical of a jet aircraft. For an aircraft on the ground (during engine run-up and during takeoff from a runway), calculations indicate that noise suppression is both feasible and practical. For an aircraft in the air, while noise suppression is feasible, it is not necessarily practical due to the fact that the most advantageous locations for the suppressing control sources are midway between the ground and the flight path. However, this may not preclude a limited application for very confined areas and for aircraft at relatively low altitudes.	noise reduction;zero suppression	W. A. Kinney;Geoffrey B.

They are typically measured from discrete source positions at a constant distance. Spherical harmonics decompositions have been shown to provide a flexible representation of HRTFs. Practical constraints often prevent the retrieval of measurement data from certain directions, a circumstance that complicates the decomposition of the measured data into spherical harmonics. A least-squares fit of coefficients is a potential approach to determining the coefficients of incomplete data. However, a straightforward non-regularized fit tends to give unrealistic estimates for the region were no measurement data is available. Recently, a regularized least-squares fit was proposed, which yields well-behaved results for the unknown region at the expense of reducing the accuracy of the data representation in the known region. In this paper, we propose using a lower-order non-regularized least-squares fit to achieve a well-behaved estimation of the unknown data. This data then allows for a high-order non-regularized least-squares fit over the entire sphere. We compare the properties of all three approaches applied to modeling the magnitudes of the HRTFs measured from a manikin. The proposed approach reduces the normalized mean-square error by approximately 7 dB in the known region and 11 dB in the unknown region compared to the regularized fit.	acoustic cryptanalysis;coefficient;covox speech thing;data (computing);head-related transfer function;least squares;mean squared error	Jens Ahrens;Mark R.

The aim of this paper is twofold. The first concerns the definition of design constraints about the pulse amplitude and waveform to transmit, as well as the immunity requirements of the receiver. The second issue concerns the assessment of the procedures and the characteristics of the algorithms to use for signal processing to retrieve the breathing frequency and respiration waveform. The algorithm has to work correctly in the presence of surrounding electromagnetic noise due to other sources in the environment. The highly reflecting walls increase the difficulty of the problem and the hostile scenario has to be accurately characterized. Examples of signal processing techniques able to recover breathing frequency in significant and realistic situations are shown and discussed.	algorithm;chest;clutter;contactless smart card;emi;electromagnetic environment;emergent metacognition index;interference (communication);movement;numerical analysis;oxygen;regulation;requirement;respiratory rate;rest;signal processing;simulation;specification;spectral density estimation;systems design;terrestrial television;ultra-wideband;walls of a building;waveform;standards characteristics	Marco Baldi;Graziano Cerri;Franco Chiaraluce;Lorenzo Eusebi;Paola Russo	2014		10.3390/s150100565	computer simulation;embedded system;electronic engineering;simulation;telecommunications;respiration;engineering;electrical engineering;signal processing;electricity;fourier analysis;physics;thorax;electromagnetic compatibility	HCI	84.68611486282042	-41.0650124720928	136339

The common practice to use a detection threshold may fail when the assumed channel model is mismatched or when noise transients exist. We propose to detect and evaluate the ToA by labeling samples of observed data as `signal' or `noise'. Then, signal is detected when enough samples are labeled as `signal', and ToA is estimated according to the position of the first `signal'-related sample. We take a clustering approach, thereby obviating the need for a detection threshold and training. Our method combines a constrained expectation-maximization (EM) with the Viterbi algorithm, and becomes handy when channel conditions are rough, noise statistics is hard to estimate, and signal-to-noise ratio is low. Numerical and experimental results show that, at the cost of some additional complexity, our proposed algorithm outperforms common benchmark methods in terms of detection and false alarm rates, and in terms of accuracy of ToA estimation.	acoustic cryptanalysis;benchmark (computing);channel (communications);cluster analysis;expectation–maximization algorithm;handy board;hidden markov model;mixture model;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;signal-to-noise ratio;state transition table;stochastic matrix;viterbi algorithm	Roee Diamant;Ryan Kastner;Michele Zorzi	2016	2016 IEEE 17th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)	10.1109/SPAWC.2016.7536820	speech recognition;computer science;pattern recognition;statistics	Robotics	83.20743227420465	-36.683073814870596	136767

While joint suppression of the interferences in the direction, polarization, and range domains is achieved, the beamformer needs only one of the following source knowledge (maybe inaccurate) about signal of interest (SOI): direction, polarization, and range. The beamformer is robust to the error in the sample estimates of SOI steering vector and array covariance matrix via eigenvalue smoothing regularization. A minimum mean squared error criterion for choosing adaptively the regularization factor in eigenvalue smoothing is also presented for noncircular SOI.

In this paper, we present a novel speech separation scheme by using two microphones that does not have this restriction. The technique utilizes the estimation of interaural time difference (ITD) statistics and binary time-frequency mask for the separation of mixed speech sources. The novelties of the paper consist in: (1) the extended application of delay-and-sum beamforming (DSB) and cosine function for ITD calculation; and (2) the clarification of the connection between ideal binary mask and DSB amplitude ratio.

HTBT is a re-parametrization map on the sphere, preserves differential operators. ? Variable resolution global spectral method is generated through re-parametrization. ? Resolution is finer over the tropics and decreases smoothly away from it. ? Spectral coefficients are computed through FFT and Gaussian quadrature methods. ? Boyd-Vandeven filter helps to retain the higher order accuracy of the method. A variable resolution global spectral method is created on the sphere using High resolution Tropical Belt Transformation (HTBT). HTBT belongs to a class of map called reparametrisation maps. HTBT parametrisation of the sphere generates a clustering of points in the entire tropical belt; the density of the grid point distribution decreases smoothly in the domain outside the tropics. This variable resolution method creates finer resolution in the tropics and coarser resolution at the poles. The use of FFT procedure and Gaussian quadrature for the spectral computations retains the numerical efficiency available with the standard global spectral method. Accuracy of the method for meteorological computations are demonstrated by solving Helmholtz equation and non-divergent barotropic vorticity equation on the sphere.	spectral method	S.

b61645e4fcec36003bdeff3732f904939762a728	generative adversarial networks for recovering missing spectral information		Ultra-wideband (UWB) radar systems nowadays typically operate in the low-frequency spectrum to achieve pene­tration capability. However, this spectrum is also shared by many other communication systems, leading to tremendous interference in a large number of frequency bands. Although avoiding these frequency bands is a natural solution, the resulting frequency gaps not only lower the signal-to-noise ratio in the received radar signals but the fragmented radar spectrum also creates severe sidelobes, which can destroy the original features of the targets of interest. In this paper, we propose to recover this missing spectral information via a generative adversarial network, called SARGAN, which learns the relationship between original and missing-frequency-band signals by observing numerous possible training pairs in a clever way. Initial results shows that this approach is promising in tackling this challenging problem: our recovered signals achieve on average more than 18 dB gain in the signal-to-noise ratio when up to 90% of the operating spectrum is missing. Moreover, the proposed SARGAN accomplishes this performance level without any prior knowledge of the locations of the missing frequency bands.		Dung N. Tran;Trac D. Tran;Lam H.

The SVD of the data matrix {x,i} provides two orthogonal matrices that convey information on propagation vectors and normalized wavelets. The constraint imposed by the orthogonality's condition for the propagation vectors introduce errors in the signal subspace. To relax this condition, another matrix of normalized wavelet is calculated exploiting the concept of Independent Component Analysis (ICA). Efficiency of this new separation tool using the combined SVD-ICA procedure is shown on realistic dataset.	acoustic fingerprint;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;signal processing;signal subspace;singular value decomposition;software propagation;unit propagation;wavelet	Valeriu Vrabie;Jérôme I.

Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the fluorescence emission spectra of all regions at 410 nm excitation to determine the emission wavelengths for defect detection. The major emission wavelengths were 688 nm and 506 nm for the detection.

The proposed approach is derived from solutions commonly adopted in spatial source separation and can be used as a post-filter in traditional multi-channel speech enhancement schemes. Since it is not based on a modeling of the coherence of diffuse noise, the proposed method complements traditional post-filters implementations, targeting non diffuse/coherent sources. It is particularly effective in domestic scenarios where microphones in a given room capture interfering coherent sources active in adjacent rooms. An experimental analysis on the DIRHA-GRID corpus shows that the proposed method considerably improves the signal-to-interference-ratio and can be used on top of state-ofthe-art multi-channel speech enhancement methods.	coherence (physics);corpus linguistics;interference (communication);microphone;source separation;speech enhancement	Alessio Brutti;Antigoni Tsiami;Athanasios Katsamanis;Petros Maragos	2016		10.21437/Interspeech.2016-150	speech recognition;artificial intelligence;pattern recognition;computer science;time–frequency analysis;masking (art);speech enhancement;communication channel	Vision	84.020424592412	-35.469078081006835	141534

These types of structures are engineered for high performance and are used particularly in industries where low weight and high strength are desired. However, these structures are difficult to design because they often contain thousands of support elements. To design mesoscale lattice structures, current synthesis methods generally require some form of rigorous, multi-variable optimization that can slow or halt the design process. In this paper, we present a new, highly efficient, method for the design of mesoscale lattice structures, the Size Matching and Scaling method. This method eliminates the need for time-consuming optimization by using a combination of a solid-body finite element analysis and a library of pre-defined lattice configurations to generate a structure's lattice topology. In addition, we explore several methods for determining the best lattice diameter values for the lattice topology. Various 2-D and 3-D examples will be used to test and validate the method.	2.5d;active set method;converge;effective method;electronic filter topology;finite element method;halting problem;mathematical optimization;particle swarm optimization;scalability	Patrick S.

The range to a surface in the path of the emitted signal is proportional to the delay time of the light echo or the reflected signal. In practice, a diverging beam may be subject to multi-echo backscatter, and all these echoes must be resolved to estimate the multiple depths. In this paper, we propose a method for super-resolution of optical ToF signals. Our contributions are twofold. Starting with a general image formation model common to most ToF sensors, we draw a striking analogy of ToF systems with sampling theory. Based on our model, we reformulate the ToF super-resolution problem as a parameter estimation problem pivoted around the finite-rate-of-innovation framework. In particular, we show that super-resolution of multi-echo backscattered signal amounts to recovery of Dirac impulses from low-pass measurements. Our theory is corroborated by analysis of data collected from a photon counting, LiDAR sensor, showing the effectiveness of our non-iterative and computationally efficient algorithm.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;backscatter (email);dirac delta function;estimation theory;image formation;iterative method;low-pass filter;sampling (signal processing);sensor;signal reflection;super-resolution imaging	Ayush Bhandari;Andrew M.

In the present work, a complex contact impedance effect ratio <italic>ξ</italic> is defined to quantitatively evaluate the effect of the contact impedance on the accuracy of the reconstructed images by micro EIT.

28317adeaac916d0c7f0b3d09d4699285ac8af6d	parallel implementations of beamforming design and filtering for microphone array applications		One of the main limitations of microphone array algorithms for audio applications has been their high computational cost in real acoustic environments when real-time signal processing is absolutely required. Regarding audio/speech signal processing, beamforming algorithms have been used for the recovery of acoustic signals from their observations when they are corrupted by noise, reverberation and other interfering signals. In order to reduce their high computational load, frequency-based filtering have been used to achieve a real time application. Our research focuses on the use of different multicore/manycore platforms in order to achieve a real time beamforming application in the time domain. Efficient algorithms has been proposed and tested in several devices and results have shown that GPU implementation of beamforming design and filtering outperforms multicore implementation in computational cost terms. The performance obtained suggests that GPU implementation paves the way for low-cost real-time audio beamforming applications.	acoustic cryptanalysis;acoustic fingerprint;algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;beamforming;best, worst and average case;cuda;central processing unit;computational complexity theory;filter design;graphics processing unit;library (computing);manycore processor;microphone;multi-core processor;parallel computing;real-time clock;real-time locating system;real-time transcription;signal processing;speech processing;speedup;unix signal	Jorge Lorente;Gema Piñero;Antonio M.

A bounded symmetrical approximation of the logarithm is employed to estimate the interaural level difference, resulting in identical values for symmetrical (left/right) frontal angles. It proposes a new cost function to be used in association with the multichannel Wiener filter technique to provide a trade-off between noise reduction and distortion of the localization cues. Simulations of a binaural setup and comparisons with a previously developed technique show that the new method gives a signal to noise ratio improvement of up to 9.6 dB better than the baseline technique, for the same maximum-tolerated binaural-cue distortion.	approximation;baseline (configuration management);binaural beats;computer simulation;distortion;internet listing display;loss function;noise reduction;signal-to-noise ratio;wiener filter	Márcio Holsbach Costa;Patrick A.

In a conversation using a binaural hearing aid, continuous tracking of sound sources with acoustics signals are sometimes complicated because sound sources move dynamically. In order to make the tracking of sound sources simple, it is considered to be helpful to use non-verbal information in communication. Since a user's body movement, including a head, corresponds to speakers' positions, it is possible to estimate communication zone where sound sources locate by a head direction. In this paper, a head movement in a conversation, as non-verbal information in communication, is measured and discussed. A rotational angle of a head movement is estimated by an inertial sensor which has an accelerometer, angular velocity sensor, and a magnetic field sensor with attaching to left ear position. A relationship between a head movement and directions of sound sources during a conversation by multiple speakers is presented. The results indicate a possibility for estimating a communication zone.	angularjs;binaural beats;covox speech thing;experiment;motion capture;velocity (software development)	Yoshifumi Chisaki;Shogo Tanaka	2014	Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA), 2014 Asia-Pacific	10.1109/APSIPA.2014.7041784	speech recognition;binaural recording;acoustics;engineering;head-related transfer function;head shadow;acoustic source localization;audiology	Robotics	86.46222464181658	-35.40153419612756	145968

The method utilises UAV rotor characteristics as well as microphone recorded signals to combat practical limitations seen in a previous study. The proposed method was evaluated on a simulation platform modelled after the UAV used in the previous study. Results showed that the proposed method was able to estimate the rotor noise PSD to within 1.3-3.3 dB log spectral distortion (LSD) regardless of the presence of surrounding sound sources.

This method estimates noises using a subtractive microphone array and subtracts them from the noisy speech signal using the Spectral Subtraction (SS). Since this method can estimate noises analytically and frame by frame, it is easy to estimate noises not depending on these acoustic properties. Therefore, this method can also reduce non stationary noises, for example sudden noises when a door has just closed, which can not be reduced by other SS methods. The results of computer simulations and experiments in a real environment show that this method can reduce LPC log spectral envelope distortions.	acoustic cryptanalysis;computer simulation;distortion;experiment;front-end processor;lpc;microphone;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;noise reduction;speech recognition;stationary process;stellar classification	Mitsunori Mizumachi;Masato Akagi	1998		10.1109/ICASSP.1998.675436	computer simulation;gradient noise;gaussian noise;image noise;effective input noise temperature;computer vision;noise;speech recognition;colors of noise;dark-frame subtraction;value noise;noise temperature;computer science;noise measurement;front and back ends;noise;noise;noise reduction;noise figure;noise floor;noise;salt-and-pepper noise	Robotics	83.75053244680139	-34.40454764619741	146588

The method is a maximum likelihood estimator and is based on a parametric model where the signals in the various channels share the same fundamental frequency but can have different amplitudes, phases, and noise characteristics. This essentially means that the model allows for different conditions in the various channels, like different signal-to-noise ratios, microphone characteristics and reverberation. Moreover, the method does not assume that a certain array structure is used but rather relies on a more general model and is hence suited for a large class of problems. Simulations with real signals shows that the method outperforms a state-of-the-art multi-channel method in terms of gross error rate.	computer simulation;microphone;parametric model;pitch detection algorithm;signal-to-noise ratio	Mads Græsbøll Christensen	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6287903	speech recognition;noise-canceling microphone;reverberation;noise;speech;harmonic analysis;mathematics;maximum likelihood;estimation theory	Robotics	83.34138064479296	-35.36437174314291	146613

This is an important problem since loudspeaker impulse responses constitute a vital component in some signal processing applications such as correction of loudspeaker characteristics. Up to now the most accurate but also most expensive method has been to estimate the impulse responses from measurements taken in an anechoic chamber. We present a method that allows good estimation of loudspeaker impulse responses in an ordinary echoic environment. This is accomplished by estimating the acoustic path of the room using a second loudspeaker with a known impulse response. Numerical simulations are carried out in order to study the performance of the suggested method.

However, a very high-order adaptive filter and multiple echo paths for each microphone result in difficulties in algorithm convergence and hardware implementation. This paper presents a distributed system which performs acoustic echo cancellation in the microphone unit. Each acoustic echo cancellation microphone unit has two closely spaced directional microphones pointing in opposite directions and a much lower order adaptive filter than in the earlier systems.

dfad99fe6d9bbba16d089a0c8779894b3d749446	a modulation property of time-frequency derivatives of filtered phase and its application to aperiodicity and fo estimation		We introduce a simple and linear SNR (strictly speaking, periodic to random power ratio) estimator (0 dB to 80 dB without additional calibration/linearization) for providing reliable descriptions of aperiodicity in speech corpus. The main idea of this method is to estimate the background random noise level without directly extracting the background noise. The proposed method is applicable to a wide variety of time windowing functions with very low sidelobe levels. The estimate combines the frequency derivative and the time-frequency derivative of the mapping from filter center frequency to the output instantaneous frequency. This procedure can replace the periodicity detection and aperiodicity estimation subsystems of recently introduced open source vocoder, YANG vocoder.

Under the assumption that the sources are in the far field, this problem can be formulated as a constrained low-rank matrix factorization with an unknown column offset. Our focus is on handling missing entries, particularly when the measurement matrix does not contain a single complete column. This case has not received attention in the literature and is not handled by existing algorithms, however it is prevalent in practice. We propose an iterative algorithm that works with pairwise differences between the measurements eliminating the dependence on the unknown offset. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance both in terms of accuracy and versatility.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;direction of arrival;iterative method;microphone	Miranda Krekovic;Gilles Baechler;Ivan Dokmanic;Martin Vetterli	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2018.8462559	iterative method;mathematical optimization;artificial intelligence;noise measurement;computer science;microphone array;pattern recognition;matrix (mathematics);offset (computer science);matrix decomposition;pairwise comparison;direction of arrival	Robotics	84.77612038451426	-37.11419470887754	149777

While standard pole-zero designs minimize the squared difference between the desired and designed frequency responses, the synthesis of binaural acoustic fields is more likely to be sensitive to relative, rather than absolute, differences in the HRTF approximations. The paper proposes a new design algorithm that minimizes an error criterion based on complex logarithms. As a result, both log-magnitude and phase errors are minimized. Slight modifications to the proposed algorithm result in one for which the phase error can be ignored. A comparison of this modified algorithm to others that have been developed to minimize the log-magnitude error shows implementation advantages without sacrificing performance. In achieving comparable errors, application of the proposed algorithm to the HRTF approximation results in pole-zero model orders smaller than those required for approximating the HRTFs using a least-squares error criterion.	approximation;transfer function	Michael A.

However, in some situations, an NLAEC is inferior to a linear AEC, especially when the channel generates a negligible (or no) nonlinear echo. In general, the ratio of the linear to nonlinear echo signal power is unknown a priori, and will vary over time, thus making it difficult to know if an NLAEC would improve or degrade the cancellation. In this paper, we present two novel solutions to this problem based on the adaptive combination of linear and nonlinear echo cancellers. Both solutions perform efficiently regardless of the level of nonlinear echo. The benefits and robustness of both schemes are illustrated by experiments using Laplacian colored noise and speech input signals.	acoustic cryptanalysis;acoustic model;colors of noise;echo (command);echo suppression and cancellation;experiment;laplacian matrix;nonlinear system	Luis Antonio Azpicueta-Ruiz;Marcus Zeller;Jerónimo Arenas-García;Walter Kellermann	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959553	adaptive filter;speech recognition;computer science;signal processing;mathematics	Robotics	83.87414115355953	-33.37875814275854	150448

However the limited bandwidth of the communication link typically does not al low to transmit all microphone signals between the different nodes. Recently, a distributed node-specific MWF-based noise reduction scheme has been presented, where each node only transmits a filtered combination of its microphone signals. In this paper, the performance gain of the centralized MWF and the distributed node-specific MWF-based scheme are analyzed as a function of the available band width of the communication link.	acoustic cryptanalysis;centralized computing;microphone;noise reduction;wiener filter	Toby Christian Lawin-Ore;Simon Doclo	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2011.5946392	speech recognition;noise-canceling microphone;computer science;noise;speech;noise reduction;zinc;wiener filter;statistics	Mobile	84.52022681224952	-35.22860110463989	150627

Instead, we use frequency-domain measurements to calibrate the array position, based on the modes of the room, excited by a wide-band single source, that can be unknown. By using the fact that each measured mode can be decomposed as a sum of model-based polynomials, we build a cost function whose minimum indicates the positions of the microphones. A simple Block Coordinate Descent algorithm can be used to minimize this cost function.

Most digital hearing aids use a Weighted Overlap-Add (WOLA) structure [1] to implement the noise cancelling algorithm. Often, it is attempted to build a short time Wiener filter with a WOLA either in the FFT or in the Bark domain. Such a filter results in real valued gains to the FFT bins of the input signal and can be easily implemented in the WOLA structure. These real valued gains are also symmetrical with respect to the Nyquist rate, which results in a real valued impulse response from the filter.	algorithm;computer performance;experiment;fast fourier transform;iterative method;maxima and minima;nyquist rate;overlap–add method;quadratic programming;whole earth 'lectronic link;wiener filter	Guido Schuster;Reto Ansorge	2008	2008 16th European Signal Processing Conference		mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;speech recognition;mathematics;wiener filter	Robotics	83.8990365597092	-34.16330054111469	151192

Taking advantage of the complementary aspects of video and audio can lead to a more effective analytics framework resulting in increased system robustness. For example, sound scene analysis may indicate potential security risks outside field-of-view, pointing the camera in that direction. This paper presents a robust low-complexity method for two-microphone estimation of sound direction. While the source localization problem has been studied extensively, a reliable low-complexity solution remains elusive. The proposed direction estimation is based on the Generalized Cross-Correlation with Phase Transform (GCC-PHAT) method. The novel aspects of our approach include band-selective processing and inter-frame filtering of the GCC-PHAT objective function prior to peak detection. The audio bandwidth, microphone spacing, angle resolution, processing delay and complexity can all be adjusted depending on the application requirements. The described algorithm can be used in a multi-microphone configuration for spatial sound localization by combining estimates from microphone pairs. It has been implemented as a real-time demo on a modified TI DM8127 IP camera. The default 16 kHz audio sampling frequency requires about 5 MIPS processing power in our fixed-point implementation. The test results show robust sound direction estimation under a variety of background noise conditions.	algorithm;closed-circuit television;cross-correlation;fixed-point arithmetic;ip camera;loss function;microphone;motion estimation;optimization problem;processing delay;real-time clock;real-time computing;requirement;sampling (signal processing);video content analysis	Jacek Stachurski;Lorin Netsch;Randy Cole	2013	2013 10th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance	10.1109/AVSS.2013.6636622	adaptive filter;computer vision;estimation;speech recognition;noise-canceling microphone;computer science;noise measurement;information security;signal-to-noise ratio;statistics	Robotics	83.3571522149982	-39.95735025734066	152169

With this inspiration, wideband acoustic methods for underwater sensing are being developed. In this paper we explore what we expect to gain from the wide bio-inspired beampattern of such a sonar. The system employed here (the BioSonar) uses wideband sensors based on dolphin sonar, covering a frequency band from around 30kHz to 150kHz and having a frequency dependent beamwidth considerably larger than that of conventional imaging sonars. We highlight the benefits of the transducers' beamwidth, indicating how these properties may be exploited to give improved sonar performance.	dolphin;sonar	Yan Pailhas;Chris Capus;Keith E.

Traditional MFP only uses the pressure information of the sound field. The vector sensor measures the pressure and three orthogonal components of the particle velocity simultaneously. A novel MFP method based on vertical vector-sensor array for location is proposed. Three Bartlett processors are put forward based on matching acoustic intensity flux. The performance of this algorithm is examined in simulation example. They can suppress side-lobes effectively with high resolution. And the fusion algorithm for the newly Bartlett processors is introduced in to take full advantage of the vector field. Furthermore, the combine processors have a more promising performance. Hence, the method base on matching acoustic intensity flux brings a new way for MFP.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;bartlett's bisection theorem;beamforming;central processing unit;simulation;software propagation;velocity (software development)	Wangsheng Lin;Guolong Liang;Yan Wang;Jianfei Ji	2011	2011 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2011.6096927	electronic engineering;speech recognition;acoustics;engineering;acoustic source localization;sensor array	Robotics	86.5386967772167	-37.370612594789165	152608

The proposed method utilizes a state-space model in which acoustic echo reduction filters are regarded as a time-varying state-vector due to asynchrony of the A/D converter and the D/A converter. In addition to the state-space model for acoustic echo reduction filters, the proposed method utilizes an additional state-space model in which noiseless multichannel speech signals are regarded as a state vector. By using the second state-space model, we can update the dereverberation filter under noisy environments. To optimize two types of state space models, the proposed method utilizes the variational Bayes framework. Two Kalman smoother based parameter optimization stages are performed alternatively. The proposed method is evaluated by using recorded data in a real teleconferencing room. The experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce acoustic echo signal, speech reverberation, and background noise more effectively than the conventional method by authors even when the A/D converter and the D/A converter are asynchronous.	acoustic cryptanalysis;analog-to-digital converter;asynchronous i/o;digital-to-analog converter;kalman filter;mathematical optimization;noise reduction;quantum state;state space;state-space representation;variational principle	Masahito Togami	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7177940	speech recognition;computer science;speech;signal-to-noise ratio	EDA	83.99124825729658	-35.244972019460256	152771

In the AEC, the step-size parameter of the adaptive filter must be varied according to the situations where a double talk and an echo path change occur. The proposed AEC can appropriately control the step-size parameter even if the double talk and the echo path change simultaneously occur because the optimal step-size parameter can be obtained according to the output of the sub-adaptive filter and the echo path change detector is controlled through the double talk detector. Hence, the proposed AEC can realize superior convergence property to the conventional one. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed AEC can achieve higher ERLE and faster convergence than the conventional one.	acoustic cryptanalysis;adaptive filter;echo suppression and cancellation;norm (social);simulation;vergence	Satoshi Ohta;Yoshinobu Kajikawa;Yasuo Nomura	2006	2007 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - ICASSP '07	10.1109/ICASSP.2007.366622	adaptive filter;computer vision;speech recognition;computer science	Robotics	84.23239037383081	-33.52578386441311	153797
7eeb9cc01daa724a0c5766cb9eb823d2a58f9a94	robust design of farrow-structure-based steerable broadband beamformers with sparse tap weights via convex optimization	signal image and speech processing;acoustics;mathematics in music;engineering acoustics	The Farrow-structure-based steerable broadband beamformer (FSBB) is particularly useful in the applications where sound source of interest may move around a wide angular range. However, in contrast with conventional filter-andsum beamformer, the passband steerability of FSBB is achieved at the cost of high complexity in structure, i.e., highly increased number of tap weights. Moreover, it has been shown that the FSBB is sensitive to microphone mismatches, and robust FSBB design is of interest to practical applications. To deal with the aforementioned problems, this paper studies the robust design of the FSBB with sparse tap weights via convex optimization by considering some a priori knowledge of microphone mismatches. It is shown that although the worst-case performance (WCP) optimization has been successfully applied to the design of robust filter-and-sum beamformers with boundedmicrophonemismatches, it may become unapplicable to robust FSBB design due to its over-conservativeness nature. When limited knowledge of mean and variance of microphone mismatches is available, a robust FSBB design approach based on the worst-case mean performance optimization with the passband response variance (PRV) constraint is devised. Unlike the WCP optimization design, this approach performs well with the capability of passband stability control of array response. Finally, the robust FSBB design with sparse tap weights has been studied. It is shown that there is redundancy in the tap weights of FSBB, i.e., robust FSBB design with sparse tap weights is viable, and thus leads to low-complexity FSBB.

There are many factors that may effect the resolvability of MUSIC method in solving MCG inverse problem. For example, the number and space arrangement of sensors, the signal-noise ratio (SNR) of measurement data, the relative position of dipole to the sensors, the direction of dipole. In the case of multiple dipoles are assumed, the distance and time correlation between the dipoles may take a great effect on the solution accuracy. We need a quantitative method to evaluate the resolvability of MUSIC algorithm. In this paper spherically symmetric conductor model is applied as the forward model. The statistical performance of the MUSIC algorithm is discussed by using the MUSIC error covariance matrix. The Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) on localization errors for MCG current source dipole models is presented. The performance of MUSIC algorithm is compared with the ultimate performance corresponding to the CRLB. The numerical studies with simulated MCG data are presented in two cases: one dipole is assumed and two dipoles are assumed. From our analysis and simulations, we can conclude that, for uncorrelated dipole signals, the MUSIC algorithm has an excellent performance. For correlated dipole signals, however, the MUSIC cannot achieve the CRLB. Our numerical analysis also demonstrate the degradation of the MUSIC efficiency when the time correlation between two dipoles increases even for high values of the number of sensors and SNR. We also see that localization error is not simply a function of the relative distance between the two dipoles, but rather a complex function of absolute dipole position and orientation.	algorithm	Jiange Chen;Noboru Niki;Yutaka Nakaya;Hiroshi Nishitani;Y.

This new technology could allow for real-time cargo integrity verification and improved shipping and transportation security. This paper takes the initial steps in developing a temperature invariant descriptor by comparing three time-of-flight (TOF) estimation methods from the literature using in situ data. The methods compared are matched filter, leading edge envelope line fit, and a simple envelope half-peak intercept. The results show that the simple half-peak intercept method provided the most consistent TOF estimate with respect to overlapping pulse data.	embedded system;matched filter;real-time transcription;visual intercept	Patrick McVittie;Les E.

In this scenario, double-talk refers to the situation in which there is an active speaker both in the remote room and in the local room. The detection of double-talk is one of the main issues to be faced in such systems to ensure a correct echo cancellation. Indeed, filters coefficients update has to be suppressed during double-talk in order to prevent the filter from diverging because of the presence of the local speaker. In this paper, a novel approach for double-talk detection is discussed based on the estimation of the fundamental frequency of the residual error signals through adaptive second-order notch filters. More specifically, simultaneous speaker activity in the remote and local rooms is revealed by exploiting the same frequency tracking introduced for multichannel decorrelation. Several experiments have been carried out to prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach also making comparison with other solutions of the state of the art.	acoustic coupler;acoustic cryptanalysis;coefficient;decorrelation;echo (computing);echo suppression and cancellation;estimation theory;experiment;loudspeaker;microphone;powered speakers;spectral density estimation;voice activity detection	Stefania Cecchi;Laura Romoli;Francesco Piazza	2016	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2015.2502761	loudspeaker;database index;computer vision;speech recognition;decorrelation;computer science	Vision	82.9198727146406	-34.91894143859227	158771

The development goal was to devise a system that allows for highly spatially resolved full-frame 2-D scans that conventional systems are not able to provide. Furthermore, it is able to allow for a sufficiently large physical separation between the measuring head and the inspected surface to accommodate industrial environments that provide a high operating velocity and is able to detect quality problems of square millimeter in size. The system consists of a heat source that introduces a thermal transient to the surface layer of the specimen, a thermal imaging system to acquire the time-dependent cooling behavior, and an image processing system to determine thermal parameters indicative of surface quality and/or coating thickness. The results clearly show that a thickness resolution of better than 50 mum can reliably be obtained at a scanning velocity of 0.37 m/s, covering a field of view (FOV) of approximately 200 times 140 mm2.	biological specimen;computer cooling;field of view in video games;full-frame digital slr;image processing;thickness (graph theory);velocity (software development)	Florian Maier;Bernhard G.

A family of interpolated schemes using a rectilinear, nonstaggered grid is reviewed, and the most accurate and isotropic schemes are identified. Frequency-dependent boundaries are modeled using a digital impedance filter formulation that is consistent with locally reacting surface theory. A structurally stable and efficient boundary formulation is constructed by carefully combining the boundary condition with the interpolated scheme. An analytic prediction formula for the effective numerical reflectance is given, and a stability proof provided. The results indicate that the identified accurate and isotropic schemes are also very accurate in terms of numerical boundary reflectance, and outperform directly related methods such as Yee's scheme and the standard digital waveguide mesh. In addition, one particular scheme-referred to here as the interpolated wideband scheme-is suggested as the best scheme for most applications.	characteristic impedance;finite-difference time-domain method;interpolation;numerical analysis;regular grid;simulation	Konrad Kowalczyk;Maarten van Walstijn	2010	IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing	10.1109/TASL.2009.2023645	digital filter;acoustics;boundary value problem;calculus;mathematics;reflectivity	Visualization	87.53754674096739	-32.698818258247385	160993
59e1f18c2d3b2c7961e7d068e0c4170aee961ff2	a unified convolutional beamformer for simultaneous denoising and dereverberation		This paper proposes a method for estimating a convolutional beamformer that can perform denoising and dereverberation simultaneously in an optimal way. The application of dereverberation based on weighted prediction error (WPE) followed by denoising based on a minimum variance distortionless response beamformer (MVDR) has conventionally been considered a promising approach, however, the optimality of this approach is not guaranteed. To realize the optimal integration of denoising and dereverberation, we present a method that unifies WPE and a variant of MVDR, namely a minimum power distortionless response beamformer (MPDR), into a single convolutional beamformer, and we optimize it based on a single unified optimization criterion. The proposed beamformer is referred to as a Weighted Power minimization Distortionless response beamformer (WPD). Experiments show that the proposed method substantially improves the speech enhancement performance in terms of both objective speech enhancement measures and automatic speech recognition (ASR).

In this paper, we discuss the design and implementation of a WSN that can provide an accurate DOA estimate of a single acoustic source placed in a moderately reverberant room by using only four strictly resource-constrained Berkeley Mica2 motes. We provide experimental results on the performance of our WSN in estimating the DOA of a wideband speech signal placed at different positions in the room. Using the Steered-Response-Power Phase-Transform (SRP-PHAT) algorithm along with an additional refining stage, our WSN can successfully estimate the source DOA at an 89% average success rate when the RMS DOA error margin allowed on the estimates is set to 5deg. Our results show that DOA estimation can be achieved using wireless platforms that are not as powerful as iPAQs or laptops, which were the platforms previously employed in the literature for similar purposes.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;direction of arrival;elegant degradation;habitat;laptop;modal logic;multithreading (computer architecture);network packet;real-time clock;relevance;reliability engineering;sampling (signal processing);sensor;smart environment;speech processing;thread (computing)	Murat Arabaci;Robin N.

Data measured from the full cavity length and the frequency variation techniques using the 60 GHz open resonator system and the millimeter-wave dispersive Fourier transform spectroscopy system (DFTS) are compared and analyzed. Data measured by the frequency variation technique were seen to be more accurate than those measured by the full cavity length variation technique with lower random errors for the specimens measured. The /spl epsiv/' of the specimens measured by the frequency variation technique followed closely with those measured by the millimeter-wave DFTS system with a slight difference of about 0.02%. Finally, for all the specimens measured in this paper, the DFTS system was seen to provide much better accuracy for /spl epsiv/' values. The frequency variation technique from the open resonator system generated the best tan/spl delta/.	dispersive partial differential equation;os-tan;resonance;sampling (signal processing);system of measurement	Mohammed N.

This is accomplished by conveying a realistic directional impression of sounds. Most of the successful techniques for doing this are based on the head related transfer function (HRTF). If loudspeakers are used to create the desired sound pressure field, then the cross talk associated with them will need to be compensated for. We present a method that can be used to calculate the required HRTFs using an adaptive filtering method based on the filtered X method of Widrow (1985).	adaptive filter;head-related transfer function	John W.

Accurate identification of these sections of the recording is a crucial first step for speech recognition techniques as their non-detection leads to severe degradation in performance. A possible approach to solving this problem is the use of source number estimation techniques based on the ordered profile of the spatial correlation matrix eigenvalues. In this paper we propose two approaches for detecting overlapping speech based on the Exponential Fitting Test (EFT) a source number estimation technique proposed in [1]. Firstly we propose a frequency domain implementation of the EFT, which is more appropriate when dealing with the broadband speech signals encountered in meetings. We then propose a second approach in which a correction factor is added to allow for the presence of reverberation. The performances of the proposed schemes are evaluated and compared to that of the original EFT using real meeting recordings.	curve fitting;electronic funds transfer;elegant degradation;performance;sensor;speech recognition;time complexity;turing test	Angela Quinlan;Futoshi Asano	2007	2007 15th European Signal Processing Conference		electronic engineering;speech recognition;acoustics;computer science	NLP	83.82396004002406	-35.98914690347365	163352
5ad5b05845921ff8bc50e4e2e4fb59acf2bbd1e4	a robust null-steering beamformer for acoustic feedback cancellation for a multi-microphone earpiece		To reduce acoustic feedback in hearing aids, adaptive filters are commonly used to estimate the feedback contribution in the microphone(s). While theoretically allowing for perfect feedback cancellation, in practice the solution is typically biased due to the closed-loop acoustical system. For an earpiece with multiple integrated microphones and loudspeakers, we propose to use a fixed beamformer to cancel the acoustic feedback. By steering a spatial null in the direction of the hearing aid loudspeaker we show that theoretically perfect feedback cancellation can be achieved. To increase the robustness, the null-steering beamformer is computed based on multiple measured acoustic feedback paths. Experimental results using an earpiece with two microphones in the vent and a third microphone in the concha show that the proposed robust null-steering beamformer substantially and robustly increases the added stable gain while maintaining a high perceptual quality.	asg software solutions;adaptive filter;audio feedback;beamforming;coefficient;least squares;loudspeaker;mathematical optimization;mega man zx;microphone;optimization problem;zero-forcing precoding	Henning F.

9734f9ffdafeb761fbdb003fbc89ff92c334a5bc	design and simulation of a green bi-variable mono-parametric shm node and early seismic warning algorithm for wave identification and scattering		Early seismic warning systems are key for safe future scalable infrastructures. In this work, a dual variable i.e. vibration and line of sight (LOS) based structure health monitoring (SHM) node is designed to sense tilt angle for early seismic warning and wave scattering detection. The SHM node, consisting of high-precision five bi-axis tiltmeters and five Blue-Violet laser diodes transmitter/receiver/reflector(LDTRR) assembly, has been designed and simulated in Proteus 7ISIS, MATLAB 7 and drafted in AutoCAD. In AutoCAD, a four LDTRR assembly is oriented at the bottom of building and its four co-planer reflectors have been orthogonally placed at effective radii with respect to the characteristic wavelengths of P, S, and Rayleigh whilst Love seismic waves, and one reflector is placed at the bottom of building. PV umbrella with a Li-ion battery has been used for green ergonomic shape. The time plots from real tiltmeter sensor nodes and data acquired from the proposed SHM node show similar behavior and results. The derived parameters of wavelength S, i.e. seismic parameter F,varied linearly from safe to hazardous seismic conditions. The variation from safe seismic to hazardous seismic transition of randomly simulated environment, also varied network traffic in GPS module as per defined threshold of sensor variables in Proteus ISIS Electronics Design Automation (EDA) engine. As per early warning evaluation functions (EWEF), the proposed design for early seismic warning algorithm (ESWA) can be a cost-effective analytics resource for any scalable SHM solution for observation range within 5km+ radius at low cost and 20km at moderate/high cost.	algorithm;autocad;computer-aided design;diode;displacement mapping;electronic design automation;embedded system;global positioning system;human factors and ergonomics;isis;matlab;network traffic control;optic axis of a crystal;parametric oscillator;proteus;randomness;rayleigh–ritz method;scalability;seismic analysis;simulation;super high material cd;transmitter;velocity (software development);virtual reality;while	Farid Touati;Hasan Tariq;Damiano Crescini;Adel Ben Manouer	2018	2018 14th International Wireless Communications & Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2018.8450277	electronics;seismic wave;transmitter;algorithm;tiltmeter;wavelength;semiconductor laser theory;computer science;warning system;vibration	Robotics	89.28640332225656	-27.79398575807604	164140

This is achieved by calculating the cross spectral density matrix (CSDM) generated from individual sound sources and applying them to a minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR), a nonlinear processor. The individual CSDMs are calculated by separating and extracting a Sequence CLEAN-based data vector from the CSDM of the data vector received from multiple targets. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method improves the MVDR performance in the case of multiple targets.	algorithm;clean	Hyeong-Uk Lee;Tae-Gyun Lim;Chan-Sik Hwang	2005	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietfec/e88-a.7.1767	real-time computing;speech recognition;telecommunications	Vision	84.66326498096343	-36.065910668058365	164398

Under complicated environments, for example, there are different types of sources existing in the far field or more than one source in the same direction, common array processing methods do not consider these situations. But they will bring difficulty when we want to acquire the characteristics of these sources. Some sources may be indistinguishable in space, but they may be distinguishable in time-frequency domain, which we can use while analyzing the sources. The paper adopts spatial filtering and time frequency distribution (TFD) to deal with these situations. Spatial filtering can keep the sources in a particular direction from being interrupted by sources in other directions and extract the original signals in that direction, while TFD is used to analyze the extracted signals in time-frequency domain to get some information of signals of the sources, such as the frequency range. Simulation results prove the effectiveness of the method.	signal processing	Wenyan Liu;Xiaotao Huang;Tong Jin	2011		10.1109/WCSP.2011.6096787	electronic engineering;speech recognition;telecommunications;computer science;sensor array	HPC	84.50683515273579	-38.2542848511602	164805

The HRTFs are significant functions for generating 3D sounds for immersive audio systems. The HRTFs, however, are not only functions of sound arrival directions but are also variable due to listeners' individual differences. Thus generation of the individual HRTFs using a few HRTF data records is desired. This report investigates a possibility in generating HRTFs for an individual subject from a database and a limited number of measured individual HRTFs. The estimation errors which are observed in the generated HRTFs can be evaluated by the signal to deviation ratio (SDR). A present example using 4 subjects' HRTFs shows that individual HRTFs in the horizontal plane can be synthesised with SDR greater than about 6 dB. Sub-band analysis/synthesis for the HRTFs is under study.	acoustic cryptanalysis;function representation;head-related transfer function	Mikio Toyama;Michiki Uchiyama;Hiroaki Nomura	1999		10.1109/MMSP.1999.793824	speech recognition;teleconference;audio signal processing;interpolation;computer science;horizontal plane;directional sound;head-related transfer function;transfer function;convolution;signal generator	HCI	86.53969382578684	-33.00896403551341	165067

The primary noise added to the speech is reduced by subtracting a filtered version of the second microphone reference noise. The reference noise filter is adaptively up dated using the Widrow-Hoff LMS algorithm [1]. The effectiveness of noise suppression depends directly on the ability of the filter to estimate the transfer function relating the primary and reference noise channels. A study of the filter length required to achieve a desired noise reduction level in a hard-walled room is presented. Results demonstrating noise reduction in excess 10dB in an environment with 0dB signal noise ratio are presented.	acoustic cryptanalysis	Dennis Pulsipher;Steven F. Boll;Craig K.

In real world soundscapes the sounds we usually listen to include background or “ambient” sounds such as the sounds of the ventilation system in a room. However, current virtual auditory display systems generate point sound sources which are often attributed to specific object locations. Therefore, it is possible to reproduce sound direction, but no information about the sound space is included. As a result, the sound output is often dry and unnatural. In this research, a rendering method for ambient sounds and its effects are investigated. An optimum rendering algorithm of ambient sounds is proposed and its effects on the quality of sound space are examined.	algorithm;auditory display;interaction;rendering (computer graphics);virtual reality	Satoshi Yairi;Yukio Iwaya;Maori Kobayashi;Makoto Otani;Yôiti Suzuki;Takeru Chiba	2009	2009 Fifth International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing	10.1109/IIH-MSP.2009.267	speech recognition;ambient noise level;computer science;noise measurement;noise;sound masking;generic point;virtual reality;head	Visualization	86.11066943251552	-33.744213005699855	166760

One such approach uses speech captured by a microphone in an occluded ear canal. Although high in signal-to-noise ratio, bone and tissue conducted speech has a limited bandwidth with a high frequency roll-off at 2 kHz. In this paper, the potential of using various bandwidth extension techniques is investigated by studying the mutual information between the signals of three uniquely placed microphones: inside an occluded ear, outside the ear and in front of the mouth. Using a Gaussian mixture model approach, the mutual information of the low and high-band frequency ranges of the three microphone signals at varied levels of signal-tonoise ratio is measured. Results show that a speech signal with extended bandwidth and high signal-to-noise ratio may be achieved using the available microphone signals.	bandwidth extension;microphone;mixture model;mutual information;roll-off;signal-to-noise ratio;speech synthesis	Rachel E.

In particular, a batch-wise adaptation in the frequency domain based on the independent component analysis (ICA) can be effectively used to jointly perform source separation and multi-channel acoustic echo cancellation (MCAEC) without double-talk detection. However, the non-uniqueness problem due to the correlated far-end reference signals still affects the SBSS approach. In this paper, we analyze the structure of the SBSS de-mixing matrix and the behavior of a batch on-line adaptation algorithm under two most common far-end mixing conditions. We show that with a proper constraint on the de-mixing matrix, high echo reduction can be achieved just as the misalignment remains relatively low even for the worst-case scenario of single far-end talker and also without any pre-processing procedure to decorrelate the far-end signals.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;blind signal separation;echo suppression and cancellation;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;online and offline;preprocessor;semiconductor industry;source separation;whole earth 'lectronic link;worst-case scenario	Francesco Nesta;Ted S.

This hampers precomputed approaches which tabulate impulse responses (IRs) to allow immersive, real-time sound propagation in static scenes. We code the field of time-varying IRs in terms of a few perceptual parameters derived from the IR's energy decay. The resulting parameter fields are spatially smooth and compressed using a lossless scheme similar to PNG. We show that this encoding removes two of the seven dimensions, making it possible to handle large scenes such as entire game maps within 100MB of memory. Run-time decoding is fast, taking 100μs per source. We introduce an efficient and scalable method for convolutionally rendering acoustic parameters that generates artifact-free audio even for fast motion and sudden changes in reverberance. We demonstrate convincing spatially-varying effects in complex scenes including occlusion/obstruction and reverberation, in our system integrated with Unreal Engine 3™.	acoustic cryptanalysis;acoustic fingerprint;interpolation;lossless compression;megabyte;portable network graphics;precomputation;real-time clock;robertson–seymour theorem;scalability;software propagation;unreal development kit	Nikunj Raghuvanshi;John Snyder	2014	ACM Trans.

Since the array signal vector is unknown due to the unknown location of the source, detection is based on the generalized likelihood ratio test which involves estimation of the signal vector. Different detectors use different signal models which yield different signal estimators. It is shown that the truncated subspace detector (TSD), which uses a truncated normal mode model, yields the best performance.	acoustic cryptanalysis;approximation algorithm;mean squared error;modal logic;monte carlo method;normal mode;portable document format;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;tsd;viz: the computer game	V.

Conventional phase unwrapping methods require a continuous CPS that starts at zero frequency or at a frequency with a known unwrapped phase. A novel phase unwrapping method is proposed herein that is capable of carrying out the task without these requirements. The proposed method is applied to direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for a bandpass signal - a case that conventional methods are unable to handle. Analytical performance and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.	direction of arrival;instantaneous phase;kernel density estimation;requirement;sampling (signal processing);sensor;spectral density	Tarig Ballal;Chris J.

Acoustic vector-sensor (AVS) arrays, which are normally towed by the ship at the ends of long cables, have been proven to be very effective for target direction of arrival (DOA) estimation. The flow noise, arising from the flow of water over the vector-sensor or its housing when the array is towed, is often a major source of interference to the towed array as it is usually directly coupled to the array sensing elements. In this paper, we obtain a closed-form expression for the spatial correlations of all the components of an AVS array in a flow-noise field. We apply the noise correlation model to DOA estimation using a uniform linear AVS array beamforming. The flow-noise impact on the beamforming capabilities is evaluated via numerical simulations.	acoustic cryptanalysis;acoustic fingerprint;beamforming;direction of arrival;interference (communication);numerical analysis;sonar (symantec);sensor;simulation;towed array sonar	Nan Zou;Ing Nam Goh;Arye Nehorai	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2011.5947030	computer simulation;covariance matrix;estimation;spatial correlation;speech recognition;noise;cross-correlation;pressure sensor;mathematics;beamforming;direction of arrival;correlation;sensor array;statistics	EDA	86.29375219637836	-37.52046310664093	170317

Two cases, active and passive systems, are considered. The time delay estimation is first converted into a sinusoidal parameter estimation problem. Then the sinusoidal parameters are estimated by generalizing the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm for single-experiment data. The proposed method, referred to as the MUSIC-type algorithm, approximates the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) in terms of the mean square errors (MSKs) for different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and separations of multipath components. Simulation results show that the MUSIC-type algorithm performs better than the classical correlation approach and the conventional MUSIC method for the closely spaced components in multipath environments.	algorithm;broadcast delay;estimation theory;music (algorithm);mean squared error;multipath propagation;multiplicative noise;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;super-resolution imaging;time complexity	Feng-Xiang Ge;Dongxu Shen;Yingning Peng;Victor O.

This paper provides a framework to recreate 2D spatial multizone soundfields using an array of loudspeakers. We derive the desired global soundfield by translating individual desired soundfields to a single global co-ordinate system and applying appropriate angular window functions. We reveal some of the fundamental limits of 2D multizone soundfield reproduction. We show that the ability of multizone reproduction is dependent on (i) maximum radius of multizones, (ii) window length (size, and nature), and (iii) radial distance to the furthermost zone. We illustrate the framework by designing and simulating a two dimensional two zone soundfield.	angularjs;dvd region code;loudspeaker;radial (radio);radial basis function;simulation;spatial analysis;window function	Yan Jennifer Wu;Thushara Dheemantha Abhayapala	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959528	loudspeaker;probability density function;polar coordinate system;speech recognition;computer science;harmonic analysis;speech processing;mathematics;window function	Robotics	86.95831963392979	-34.084616910109474	170868

Before the coupling, the neuron can exhibit chaotic/periodic behavior by repeating integrate-and-fire behavior between the threshold and sinusoidal base signal. After the coupling, the system can exhibit various bifurcation phenomena. Especially, we have found an interesting phenomenon: chaotic behavior of single neuron can be changed into periodic behavior of coupled system by a delay effect. This delay-induced order and related bifurcation can be analyzed precisely using the mapping procedure. Presenting a simple equivalent circuit, basic phenomena are confirmed experimentally.	bifurcation theory;biological neuron model;chaos theory;equivalent circuit;experiment;map;program composition notation	Kozo Hisamatsu;Toshimichi Saito	2010	The 2010 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	10.1109/IJCNN.2010.5596846	equivalent circuit;computer science;control theory;mathematics;artificial neural network	Robotics	84.87445470070664	-26.420146332836808	171149

Specifically, the proposed PAF decomposes an adaptive filter into three components: a normalized finite impulse response filter, a gain factor and a time-shift factor. With a novel update scheme for the PAF, these three components can be adjusted with different step-size respectively. Therefore, the novel adaptive filter with a parametric structure is suitable to track an acoustic echo path, the change of which mainly happens to the gain and time-shift while the “basic shape” of the transfer function keeps relatively stable. It is also important to point out that the proposed PAF is a general platform of adaptive filtering, and the conventional method can be considered as a special case of this general platform. Experiments based on measured impulse response in realistic environment show that the proposed PAF outperforms the conventional method on convergence rate in echo cancellation application when dealing with channel changes caused by adjustments of system gain and delay.	acoustic cryptanalysis;adaptive filter;echo suppression and cancellation;experiment;finite impulse response;rate of convergence;transfer function	Zhiping Zhang;Zhiqiang Wu	2016	2016 10th International Symposium on Chinese Spoken Language Processing (ISCSLP)	10.1109/ISCSLP.2016.7918464	adaptive filter;convergence;kernel adaptive filter;telecommunications;shape;computer science;control theory;transfer function	Mobile	84.41139778537458	-33.568494981337096	171469

Our directional source representation is expressed as a linear combination of elementary spherical harmonic (SH) sources. In the preprocessing stage, we precompute and encode the propagated sound fields due to each SH source. At runtime, we perform the SH decomposition of the varying source directivity interactively and compute the total sound field at the listener position as a weighted sum of precomputed SH sound fields. We propose a novel plane-wave decomposition approach based on higher-order derivatives of the sound field that enables dynamic HRTF-based listener directivity at runtime. We provide a generic framework to incorporate our source and listener directivity in any offline or online frequency-domain wave-based sound propagation algorithm. We have integrated our sound propagation system in Valve's Source game engine and use it to demonstrate realistic acoustic effects such as sound amplification, diffraction low-passing, scattering, localization, externalization, and spatial sound, generated by wave-based propagation of directional sources and listener in complex scenarios.

This apparatus is for use in protocol testing evaluating any thermal or non-thermal effects on blood and blood product samples that might be caused by long-term exposure to the fields produced by the 13.56 MHz RFID reader antennas. The Helmholtz coil was initially constructed as one continuous inductor; however, stray capacitance prevented it from resonating above 10.17 MHz. It was then successfully reconstructed as a four-segment Helmholtz coil by following methods used in designing Helmholtz coils for use in magnetic resonance imaging. Complete design, construction and testing details of the segmented Helmholtz coil and its RF drive system are given both to enable duplication and as a design guide for similar large Helmholtz coils. Occupational safety recommendations are made to enable safe operation.

We present an extension of the binaural multichannel Wiener filter (BMWF), by adding an interference rejection constraint to its cost function, in order to combine the advantages of spatial and spectral filtering while mitigating directional interferences. We prove that this algorithm can be decomposed into the binaural linearly constrained minimum variance (BLCMV) algorithm followed by a single channel Wiener post-filter. The proposed algorithm yields improved interference rejection capabilities, as compared with the BMWF. Moreover, by utilizing the spectral information on the sources, it is demonstrating better SNR measures, as compared with the BLCMV.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;binaural beats;interference (communication);loss function;rejection sampling;signal-to-noise ratio;wiener filter	Elior Hadad;Daniel Marquardt;Simon Doclo;Sharon Gannot	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178048	single antenna interference cancellation;speech recognition;noise;speech;interference;signal-to-noise ratio;spatial filter	Robotics	83.95829977460117	-34.88473830210775	172860

Several contributions related to the combination of beamforming and echo cancelation have appeared in the literature so far, but, up to the authors’ knowledge, the idea of using optimal fixed BFs in a real-time SAEC system both for echo reduction and stereophonic audio rendering is first addressed in this contribution. The employment of such designed BFs allows positively addressing both issues, as the several simulated and real tests seem to confirm. In particular, the stereo-recording quality attainable through the proposed approach has been preliminarily evaluated by means of subjective listening tests. Moreover, the overall system robustness against microphone array imperfections and noise presence has been experimentally evaluated. This allowed the authors to implement a real hands-free communication system in which the usage of the proposed beamforming technique has proven its superiority with respect to the usual two-microphone one in terms of echo reduction, and guaranteeing a comparable spatial image. Moreover, the proposed framework requires a low computational cost increment with regard to the baseline approach, since only few extra filtering operations with short filters need to be executed. Nevertheless, according to the performed simulations, the BF-based SAEC configuration seems to not require the signal decorrelation module, resulting in an overall computational saving.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithmic efficiency;baseline (configuration management);beamforming;brainfuck;decorrelation;echo suppression and cancellation;experiment;microphone;real-time clock;real-time web;simulation	Matteo Pirro;Stefano Squartini;Laura Romoli;Francesco Piazza	2012	EURASIP J.

We previously proposed a generative model of multichannel signals called the multichannel facto rial hidden Markov model, which allows us to simultaneously solve these problems through a joint optimization problem formulation. In this approach, we modeled the spatial cor relation matrix of each source as a weighted sum of the spatial correlation matrices corresponding to all possible DOAs. However, it became clear through real environment experiments that the estimate of the spatial correlation matrix tended to deviate from the actual correlation matrix since the plane wave assumption does not hold due to reverber ation and noise components. To handle such deviations, we propose introducing a prior distribution over the spatial correlation matrices called the DOA mixture model instead of using the weighted sum model. The experiment showed that the proposed method provided 1.94 [dB] improvement compared with our previous method in terms of the the signal-to-distortion ratios of separated signals.	blind signal separation;direction of arrival;distortion;experiment;generative model;hidden markov model;markov chain;mathematical optimization;mixture model;optimization problem;source separation;weight function	Takuya Higuchi;Hirokazu Kameoka	2015	2015 23rd European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)	10.1109/EUSIPCO.2015.7362743	speech recognition;pattern recognition;mathematics;blind signal separation;statistics	Vision	82.98150112410889	-36.57683256990448	173070

This new type of use leads to new problems which were negligible in traditional telephony, namely the superposition of noise and echo on the speech signal. To solve these problems and provide a quality that is sufficient for telecommunications, combined reduction of these disturbances is required. This paper presents a summary of the solutions retained for this dual reduction in the context of mono-channel and two-channel sound pick-ups.	image noise;quantum superposition	Régine Le Bouquin-Jeannès;Pascal Scalart;Gérard Faucon;Christophe Beaugeant	2001	IEEE Trans.

Hardness is an especially important index for machine design. The Vickers hardness number of a test material is defined by the surface area of the indentation made in the surface of a test specimen by a diamond pyramid indenter. Diagonal lines that indicate the indentation size are usually several micrometers to several hundred micrometers long, depending on the hardness of the material. Conventional automatic Vickers hardness testing systems have been applied only to specular-polished specimens. A new fully automatic Vickers hardness testing system has been developed that emulates visual Vickers hardness testing in terms of accuracy and that automatically sets the threshold level of the image processor to suit indentation image data. It can be applied not only to the testing of rough-polished specimens while meeting the measurement accuracy specified in Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS) B 7725, but can also process one indentation within 20 s, including the indenting, focusing and image processing time.	image processing	Takao Sugimoto;Tadao Kawaguchi	1997	IEEE Trans.

The evaluation and comparison is done with a performance metric based on the speech intelligibility index (SII). The speech and noise signals are recorded in reverberant conditions with a signal-to-noise ratio of 0 dB and the spectrum of the noise signals is similar to the spectrum of the speech signal. The SVD-based technique works without initialization nor assumptions about a look direction, unlike the two-stage adaptive beamformer. Still, for different noise scenarios, the SVD-based technique performs as well as the two-stage adaptive beamformer, for a similar filter length and adaptation time for the filter coefficients. In a diffuse noise scenario, the SVD-based technique performs better than the two-stage adaptive beamformer and hence provides a more flexible and robust solution under speaker position variations and reverberant conditions.	adaptive beamformer;beamforming;coefficient;intelligibility (philosophy);microphone;noise reduction;signal-to-noise ratio;singular value decomposition	Jean-Baptiste Maj;Marc Moonen;Jan Wouters	2002	EURASIP J.

This original data is often sufficiently degraded by the recording instrument response that the individual delta function peaks are difficult to distinguish and measure. A method, which has been used to measure these peaks, is to fit a parameterized model by a nonlinear least squares fitting algorithm. The deconvolution approaches described here have the advantage of not requiring a parameterized point spread function, nor do they expect a fixed number of peaks. Two new methods will be presented. The maximum power technique will be reviewed. A maximum a posteriori technique will be introduced. Results on both simulated and real data by the two methods will be presented.

This paper addresses the provision of personal soundfields (zones) to multiple listeners using a limited number of speakers with an underlying assumption of fixed virtual sources. For such multizone systems, optimization of speaker positions and weightings is important to reduce the number of active speakers. Typically, single stage optimization is performed, but in this paper a new two-stage pressure matching optimization is proposed for wideband sound sources. In the first stage, the least-absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) is used to select the speakers' positions for all sources and frequency bands. A second stage then optimizes reproduction using all selected speakers on the basis of a regularized least-squares (LS) algorithm. The performance of the new, two-stage approach is investigated for different reproduction angles, frequency range and variable total speaker weight powers. The results demonstrate that using two-stage Lasso-LS optimization can give up to 69 dB improvement in the mean squared error (MSE) over a single-stage LS in the reproduction of two isolated audio signals within control zones using e.g. 84 speakers.	algorithm;beamforming;dvd region code;experiment;frequency band;lasso;least squares;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;multi-user;powered speakers;selectivity (electronic);software deployment	Nasim Radmanesh;Ian S.

There exist several algorithms for source localization based on array signal processing. It is of interest to know the theoretical performance limits of these estimators. In this paper we develop expressions for the Cramer-Rao-Bound (CRB) on the variance of direction-of-arrival (DOA) and range-depth estimators of underwater acoustic sources in a shallow range-independent ocean for the case of generalized Gaussian noise. We then study the performance of some of the popular source localization techniques, through simulations, for DOA/range-depth estimation of underwater acoustic sources in shallow ocean by comparing the variance of the estimators with the corresponding CRBs.	acoustic cryptanalysis;adaptive beamformer;algorithm;beamforming;direction of arrival;portable document format;signal processing;simulation	N.

Models previously used in such an approach deal with relatively simple scenarios such as a gramophone horn modelled with 70 parameters; the weakness of those models, however, is in their attempt to simultaneously model the full channel spectrum by a single all-pole filter. Not only does this lead to a large computational load, it is not parsimonious, nor is it scalable such that the algorithm can be applied to higher dimensional problems. A better approach uses subbands; in this paper, a subband all-pole filter models the channel while the source is still represented by a single-band block stationary AR process. An example is given of blindly dereverberating a signal observed through the aforementioned gramophone horn, demonstrating an equally robust, but more flexible and scalable model.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;autoregressive model;computation;estimation theory;inverse filter;occam's razor;scalability;stationary process	James R.

Both methods employ the proven-robust steered response power using the phase transform (SRP-PHAT) as a functional. To cluster the data points into highly probable regions containing global peaks, the first method fits a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), whereas the second one sequentially finds the points with highest SRP-PHAT values that most likely represent different clusters. Then the low-cost global optimization method, stochastic region contraction (SRC), is applied to each cluster to find the global peaks. We test the two methods using real data from five simultaneous talkers in a room with high noise and reverberation.

Single channel linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) filters have been proposed to remove ambient noise. In this paper, an algorithm for joint noise cancellation and dereverberation using a multi channel LCMV filter in the frequency domain is proposed. A single channel LCMV filter which accounts for the inter frame correlation is applied on each channel to remove the early reverberation component. A modified spectral subtraction method is also proposed to remove the late reverberation component present in the speech signal. Experimental results on joint noise cancellation and dereverberation indicate a reasonable improvement over conventional speech enhancement methods. Additional experiments on distant speech recognition are also conducted to illustrate the significance of the method.	algorithm;experiment;microphone;speech enhancement;speech recognition	Karan Nathwani;Rajesh Mahanand Hegde	2013			artificial intelligence;speech recognition;minimum-variance unbiased estimator;pattern recognition;active noise control;computer science;communication channel	ML	83.80547955713534	-35.01149262841012	178416

This mode brings the microphone away from the talker’s mouth. As a consequence the speech signal picked up has low Signal to Noise Ratio. Thus, to improve the SNR a noise reduction method is employed. The proposed method is an improvement of the well-known spectral subtraction method which uses one SNR-dependent gain function to suppress the noise. The proposed method reduces the residual noise artifacts by using an adaptive averaging of the gain function. The adaptation is controlled by a spectral discrepancy measure, which is obtained by comparing the averaged noise spectrum and the current input signal spectrum. Experiments show a noise reduction of 10 dB with good noise quality and significantly low residual noise distortion.

The TF representation of audio signal is obtained by Hubert spectrum (HS). The Hubert transformation together with empirical mode decomposition (EMD) produces HS which is a fine-resolution TF representation of any nonlinear and non-stationary signal. The sources are localized in the space of time and intensity differences between two microphones' signals. The separation is performed by masking the target signal in TF domain considering that the sources are disjoint orthogonal.

All of the traditional ACC approaches have been designed in the frequency domain, and then transformed into the time domain through the application of an inverse Fourier transform. Therefore, the broadband contrast performance of the traditional ACC approach is not optimum. Especially, when the length of the control filter is short, the traditional approach may have poor contrast performance at non-control frequencies. This study proposes a novel method that can achieve the optimum broadband contrast performance, which also maintains a good frequency-response consistency by introducing the response variation constraints to improve sound quality.

60e6120a60d97d2d65c7ef833512be9df26795d4	convolutive audio source separation using robust ica and reduced likelihood ratio jump		Audio source separation is the task of isolating sound sources that are active simultaneously in a room captured by a set of microphones. Convolutive audio source separation of equal number of sources and microphones has a number of shortcomings including the complexity of frequency-domain ICA, the permutation ambiguity and the problem’s scalabity with increasing number of sensors. In this paper, the authors propose a multiple-microphone audio source separation algorithm based on a previous work of Mitianoudis and Davies [1]. Complex FastICA is substituted by Robust ICA increasing robustness and performance. Permutation ambiguity is solved using the Likelihood Ration Jump solution, which is now modified to decrease computational complexity in the case of multiple microphones.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;computation;computational complexity theory;cost efficiency;fastica;independent computing architecture;kinect;microphone;sensor;sound card;source separation	Dimitrios Mallis;Thomas Sgouros;Nikolaos Mitianoudis	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-44944-9_20	speech recognition;pattern recognition	AI	83.33666088559487	-36.90556661893531	180912

HRTF measurement is difficult in the proximal region because of the lack of an appropriate acoustic point source. In this paper, a modified spark gap was used as the acoustic sound source. Our evaluation experiments showed that the spark gap was more like an acoustic point source than others previously used from the viewpoints of frequency response, directivity, power attenuation, and stability. Using this spark gap, high spatial resolution HRTFs were measured at 6344 spatial points, with distances from 20 to 160 cm, elevations from -40deg to 90deg, and azimuths from 0deg to 360deg. Based on these measurements, an HRTF database was obtained and its reliability was confirmed by both objective and subjective evaluations.	acoustic cryptanalysis;approximation algorithm;covox speech thing;experiment;frequency response;head-related transfer function	Tianshu Qu;Zheng Xiao;Mei Gong;Ying Huang;Xiaodong Li;Xihong Wu	2009	IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing	10.1109/TASL.2009.2020532	spark gap;image resolution;acoustics;telecommunications;computer science;speech processing;transfer function	Visualization	86.07738073466837	-33.63705106396821	181363

The core components of the method and apparatus are (1) capability to express the means and covariances of the set of signals in inverse form in a common coordinate frame and (2) capability to form a signal determined by a convex combination of the means and covariances, so expressed.

aa3fe00c53cd1e117a44d0fbfe58da479cf4057d	application of frequency shifting in in-car communication systems		A known approach for stabilizing acoustic feedback loops is to include time-varying processing in the signal path. Therefore, we present a subband-based implementation of a phase modulation filter that allows arbitrary frequency shifts, comment on some limitations of the method, and discuss practical implementation aspects. Listening tests are conducted in order to derive the parameter range in which the introduced frequency shift is not audible to listeners. Special test scenarios are set up to cover the intended use of the algorithm in an in-car communication (ICC) system and confirm that background noise and the direct speech components are masking the frequency shift to some extent. Experiments with an ICC system in a test car show that persistent howling occurs only after considerable increase of the system gain, but also strong artifacts are introduced. This leads to the conclusion that in the ICC context, the proposed method is particularly suited for signal decorrelation which is an important part of techniques for feedback prevention.

Although state-of-the-art spatial filters are fully data-dependent and computed using the power spectral density (PSD) matrices of the desired and the undesired signals, the existing solutions to extract sources from a SOI are only partially data-dependent. Estimating the time-varying PSD matrices from the data is a challenging problem, especially in dynamic and quickly time-varying acoustic scenes. Hence, the spot signal statistics are often pre-computed based on a near-field propagation model, resulting in suboptimal filters. In this work, we propose a fully data-dependent spatial filtering framework for extraction of speech signals that originate from a SOI. To achieve position-based spatial selectivity, distributed arrays are used, which offer larger spatial diversity compared to arrays of closely spaced microphones. The PSD matrices of the desired and the undesired signals are updated at each time-frequency bin by using a minimum Bayes risk detector that is based on a probabilistic model of narrowband position estimates. The proposed framework is applicable in challenging multitalk situations, without requiring any prior information, except the geometry, location, and orientation of the arrays.	acoustic cryptanalysis;data dependency;detection theory;interference (communication);low-rank approximation;microphone;precomputation;selectivity (electronic);software propagation;sparse matrix;spectral density;statistical model	Maja Taseska;Emanuel A.

Based on a previous study, the method seeks to improve rotor noise PSD estimation accuracy and robustness by utilising UAV rotor characteristics and microphone signals.

The system is designed to interact with a distant large screen such as a television set at home or digital signage in public. The system consists of a screen, two loudspeakers set around the screen, and a smartphone as a pointing device having a microphone and a gravity sensor inside. The position of the pointer is theoretically determined by the position and direction. This smartphone-based system approximates the position and direction by the two-dimensional position of the microphone horizontally and the pitch angle from the gravity sensor vertically. In this paper, we report experiments to evaluate the performance of the system. The loudspeakers of the system radiate burst signal from 18 to 24 kHz. The position of the smartphone is estimated at a frame rate of 15 Hz with a latency of 0.4 second. The accuracy of the pointer was measured as an angle error below 10 degrees for 100% of all frames.

f7bf5cddb0150a0b779786de6dc2d7fb5935cc0f	estimating synchronization signal phase	digital watermarking;data processing;distortion	To read a watermark from printed images requires that the watermarking system read correctly after affine distortions. One way to recover from affine distortions is to add a synchronization signal in the Fourier frequency domain and use this synchronization signal to estimate the applied affine distortion. Using the Fourier Magnitudes one can estimate the linear portion of the affine distortion. To estimate the translation one must first estimate the phase of the synchronization signal and then use phase correlation to estimate the translation. In this paper we provide a new method to measure the phase of the synchronization signal using only the data from the complex Fourier domain. This data is used to compute the linear portion, so it is quite convenient to estimate the phase without further data manipulation. The phase estimation proposed in this paper is computationally simple and provides a significant computational advantage over previous methods while maintaining similar accuracy. In addition, the phase estimation formula gives a general way to interpolate images in the complex frequency domain.	analog television;computation;digital watermarking;distortion;interpolation;phase correlation;printing;quantum phase estimation algorithm	Robert G.

A well-defined area is interrogated by a magnetic field that is periodically switched on and off. Presence of a tagged object is detected and its identity established by measuring the natural response of the tag during the transmission silence. The tag or identifier consists of a main resonant circuit, the coil of which provides magnetic coupling, and several quartz crystals that determine its identity. High reliability and insensitivity to interference are ensured due to the high quality factors involved. The use of passive identifiers provides a robust and low-cost system that can serve in a wide range of applications.	identifier	H. J. Butterweck;A. C. P. van Meer;Jean H. F.

Results presented in this work show that the technique can be used for real-time separation of speech sources using a single 20ms frame of speech, furthermore the results presented show that there is an average improvement in the Signal to Interference Ratio (SIR) for the proposed algorithm over the unprocessed recording of 15.1 dB and an average improvement of 5.4 dB in terms of Signal to Distortion Ratio (SDR) over the unprocessed recordings. In addition to the SIR and SDR results, Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ) and listening tests both show an improvement in perceptual quality of 1 Mean Opinion Score (MOS) over unprocessed recordings.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;direction of arrival;distortion;etsi satellite digital radio;interference (communication);pesq;real-time clock	Muawiyath Shujau;Christian Ritz;Ian S.

In this contribution, a geometrically constrained (GC)-TRINICON concept for RTF estimation is proposed. This approach is applicable in challenging multiple-speaker scenarios and in underdetermined situations, where the number of simultaneously active sources outnumbers the number of available microphone signals. As a most practically relevant and distinctive feature, this concept does not require any voice-activity-based control mechanism. It only requires coarse reference information on the target direction of arrival (DoA). The proposed GC-TRINICON method is compared to a recently proposed subspace method for RTF estimation relying on voice-activity control. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of GC-TRINICON in realistic conditions.	beamforming;direction of arrival;garbage collection (computer science);microphone;transfer function;video camera tube	Klaus Reindl;Shmulik Markovich Golan;Hendrik Barfuss;Sharon Gannot;Walter Kellermann	2013	2013 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics	10.1109/WASPAA.2013.6701822	electronic engineering;speech recognition;acoustics;mathematics;transfer function	Vision	85.07027882865407	-36.14489567036362	186596

That is, the sensor transmits on two transmitters a short time apart, thereby collecting echoes in virtually the same time as a single transmitter system. Moreover, the time separation of the transmitted pulses acts to identify the particular sonar system so that interference from other systems can be rejected. The sensor combines two previous sonar research efforts on double pulse coding [2] and classification [1] in a real time DSP based sensing module that is also smaller than previous sensors. Since the classification is performed with such a short delay between transmitter firings, the sensor could be deployed on moving platforms to achieve on-the-fly mapping.

A dual microphone system (DMS) is a composite directional audio-capturing device which consists of two microphones, each microphone having possibly different directional characteristics, e.g., omnidirectional, bidirectional or cardioid. By recasting the various combinations of two microphones for a DMS into a coherent and familiar framework of generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC), we subsequently derive the expected noise reduction of various structures under incoherent, coherent and diffuse noise fields, followed by a series of experiments in a typical office environment. These results are indicative of the achievable reduction of noise in real applications.

a84acdd249c617b9d292398c46787ce3f96a4b9e	a minimum variance partially distortionless response filter for single-channel noise reduction		This paper deals with the problem of single-channel noise reduction. Thanks to the eigenvalue decomposition, we arrange the eigenvalues of the speech correlation matrix in such a way that all the spectral mode signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of the noisy speech are ordered in a descending manner. By maintaining no speech distortion in the spectral modes with high input SNRs while allowing some degree of speech distortion in the modes with low input SNRs, we develop a minimum variance partially distortionless response (MVPDR) filter. We first formulate the problem and derive this filter within the general filtering framework. Then, the MVPDR filter is applied to the single-channel noise reduction problem in both the time and time-frequency domains. In comparison with the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) filter based on the subspace decomposition, the developed MVPDR filter can provide much more freedom for controlling the compromise between noise reduction and speech distortion to achieve higher speech quality. Simulations are conducted and preliminary results justify the advantages of the deduced MVPDR filter.	channel (communications);computer simulation;distortion;finite impulse response;noise (electronics);noise reduction;signal-to-noise ratio	Xianghui Wang;Jingdong Chen;Jacob Benesty	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7953101	algorithm;artificial intelligence;salt-and-pepper noise;filter (signal processing);root-raised-cosine filter;covariance matrix;noise measurement;distortion;pattern recognition;noise reduction;speech recognition;signal-to-noise ratio;mathematics	Robotics	83.59415068358861	-35.13969653584521	187984
dead1c496873edbb84ae35d68ee21f9887890c80	estimation of time-varying room impulse responses of multiple sound sources from observed mixture and isolated source signals		This paper proposes a method for online estimation of time-varying room impulse responses (RIR) between multiple isolated sound sources and a far-field mixture. The algorithm is formulated as adaptive convolutive filtering in short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain. We use the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm for estimating the filter parameters due to its fast convergence rate, which is required for modeling rapidly changing RIRs of moving sound sources. The proposed method allows separation of reverberated sources from the far-field mixture given that their close-field signals are available. The evaluation is based on measuring unmixing performance (removal of reverberated source) using objective separation criteria calculated between the ground truth recording of the preserved sources and the unmixing result obtained with the proposed algorithm. We compare online and offline formulations for the RIR estimation and also provide evaluation with blind source separation algorithm only operating on the mixture signal.	algorithm;blind signal separation;ground truth;online and offline;rate of convergence;recursion;recursive least squares filter;short-time fourier transform;source separation	Joonas Nikunen;Tuomas Virtanen	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2018.8462535	mathematical optimization;fourier transform;rate of convergence;time–frequency analysis;blind signal separation;recursive least squares filter;short-time fourier transform;computer science;reverberation;filter (signal processing)	Vision	83.50706051308828	-35.52080619769571	188056

It is found that for more simple structures the 3D digital waveguide mesh is able to reproduce the acoustic behavior up to 10 kHz with only slight errors in resonant frequencies. As the simulated structures become more geometrically complex, this shifting becomes more severe.	acoustic cryptanalysis;acoustic model;benchmark (computing);concatenation;numerical analysis;rendering (computer graphics);sampling (signal processing);simulation;spatial variability;tract (literature);volatility	Matt Speed;Damian T.

Unlike classical algorithms, which make use of the knowledge from acoustic signal alone, the glottal correlation (GCORR) algorithm takes advantage of non-acoustic throat sensors such as the general electromagnetic motion sensor (GEMS). The non–acoustic sensor provides a measure of the glottal excitation function that is relatively immune to background acoustic noise. Thus, inspired by human speech production mechanisms, the GCORR algorithm extracts the desired speech signal from noisy acoustic mixture using statistical correlation between the speech and its excitation. The algorithm leads to a significant reduction of wide–band noise, even when the SNR is very low. The improvement in the quality of the speech is demonstrated in terms of an objective evaluation.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;motion detector;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;speech enhancement	Rongqiang Hu;David V.

When a relative velocity exists between the target and the sonar, the echo signal is Doppler-shifted. This situation causes the output of the sensor to deviate from the actual target range, thus limiting its applications to stationary conditions only. This work presents an approach for correcting such a deviation. By analyzing the Doppler effect during the propagation process, the sensor output can be corrected by a Doppler factor. To obtain this factor, a conventional CTFM system is slightly modified by adding a single tone signal with a frequency that locates out-of-sweep range of the transmitted signal. The Doppler factor can be extracted from the echo. Both verification experiments and performance tests are carried out. Results indicate the validity of the proposed approach.

59b19c8839158070a09d32b218434dd64dd6f177	multiple source localization using estimation consistency in the time-frequency domain		The extraction of multiple Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) information from estimated spatial spectra can be challenging when such spectra are noisy or the sources are adjacent. Smoothing or clustering techniques are typically used to remove the effect of noise or irregular peaks in the spatial spectra. As we will explain and show in this paper, the smoothing-based techniques require prior knowledge of minimum angular separation of the sources and the clustering-based techniques fail on noisy spatial spectrum. A broad class of localization techniques give direction estimates in each Time Frequency (TF) bin. Using this information as input, a novel technique for obtaining robust localization of multiple simultaneous sources is proposed using Estimation Consistency (EC) in the TF domain. The method is evaluated in the context of spherical microphone arrays. This technique does not require prior knowledge of the sources and by removing the noise in the estimated spatial spectrum makes clustering a reliable and robust technique for multiple DoA extraction from estimated spatial spectra. The results indicate that the proposed technique has the strongest robustness to separation with up to 10° median error for 5° to 180° separation for 2 and 3 sources, compared to the baseline and the state-of-the-art techniques.	angularjs;baseline (configuration management);cluster analysis;consistency model;direction of arrival;microphone;smoothing	Sina Hafezi;Alastair H.

In particular we are interested in locating speech sources, as they are of high interest for human-robot interaction. The microphone-pair response corresponding to the direct-path sound propagation is a function of the source direction. In practice, this response is contaminated by noise and reverberations. The direct-path relative transfer function (DP-RTF) is defined as the ratio between the direct-path acoustic transfer function (ATF) of the two microphones, and it is an important feature for SSL. We propose a method to estimate the DP-RTF from noisy and reverberant signals in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain. First, the convolutive transfer function (CTF) approximation is adopted to accurately represent the impulse response of the microphone array, and the first coefficient of the CTF is mainly composed of the direct-path ATF. At each frequency, the frame-wise speech auto- and cross-power spectral density (PSD) are obtained by spectral subtraction. Then a set of linear equations is constructed by the speech auto- and cross-PSD of multiple frames, in which the DP-RTF is an unknown variable, and is estimated by solving the equations. Finally, the estimated DP-RTFs are concatenated across frequencies and used as a feature vector for SSL. Experiments with a robot, placed in various reverberant environments, show that the proposed method outperforms two state-of-the-art methods.	acoustic cryptanalysis;approximation;charge trap flash;coefficient;concatenation;feature vector;human–robot interaction;linear equation;microphone;robot;short-time fourier transform;software propagation;spectral density;stellar classification;transfer function	Xiaofei Li;Laurent Girin;Fabien Badeig;Radu Horaud	2016	2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2016.7759437	robot;speech recognition;time–frequency analysis;acoustics;sound localization;computer science;engineering;speech;mathematical model;transfer function;acoustic source localization	Robotics	85.93636296523994	-35.73493636517683	192703

The other auxiliary fixed beamfomer is used for adaptation-mode control to eliminate the hysteresis in the relationship between signal direction and sensitivity. Both auxiliary fixed beamfomers bring about good sound quality, which improve intelligibility in speech communications and speech recognition rate. The proposed microphone array is implemented on a DSP system, which demonstrates flat frequency response and less hysteresis in its directivity pattern.	digital signal processor;frequency response;hysteresis;intelligibility (philosophy);microphone;radiation pattern;sound quality;speech recognition;zero suppression	Osamu Hoshuyama;Akihiko Sugiyama	1999		10.1109/ICASSP.1999.759851	attenuation;adaptive filter;frequency response;speech recognition;sensitivity;hysteresis;computer science;speech;digital signal processing;high frequency;sound quality;interference;intelligibility;robustness	Robotics	84.6501300164116	-33.96442576955599	193134

Existing algorithms either assume speech absence and exploit a voice activity detector (VAD), or make use of additional assumptions like a diffuse noise field. Therefore, these algorithms are limited with respect to their tracking speed and the type of noise fields for which they can estimate the correlation matrix. In this paper we present a new method for noise correlation matrix estimation that makes no assumptions about the type of noise field, nor uses a VAD. The presented method exploits the existence of accurate single-channel noise PSD estimators, as well as the availability of one noise reference per microphone pair. For spatially and temporally non-stationary noise fields, the proposed method leads to improved performance compared to widely used state-of-the-art reference methods in terms of both segmental SNR and beamformer response error.	algorithm;beamforming;microphone;noise (electronics);noise reduction;signal-to-noise ratio;stationary process;voice activity detection	Richard Christian Hendriks;Timo Gerkmann	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2011.5947414	gradient noise;gaussian noise;computer vision;covariance matrix;estimation;speech recognition;value noise;computer science;noise measurement;speech;discrete fourier transform;signal processing;noise;noise reduction;mathematics;signal-to-noise ratio;correlation;statistics;salt-and-pepper noise	Robotics	83.40306542318405	-35.802692101516044	193614

The considered fluorescent inks absorb light in the UV wavelength range and reemit part of it in the visible wavelength range. In contrast to normal color printing which relies on the spectral absorption of light by the inks, at low concentration fluorescent inks behave additively, i.e. their light emission spectra sum up. We first analyze to which extent different fluorescent inks can be superposed. Due to the quenching effect, at high concentrations of the fluorescent molecules, the fluorescent effect diminishes. With an ink-jet printer capable of printing pixels at reduced dot sizes, we reduce the concentration of the individual fluorescent inks and are able to create from the blue, red and greenish-yellow inks the new colorants white and magenta. In order to avoid quenching effects, we propose a color halftoning method relying on diagonally oriented pre-computed screen dots, which are printed side by side. For gamut mapping and color separation, we create a 3D representation of the fluorescent ink gamut in CIELAB space by predicting halftone fluorescent emission spectra according to the spectral Neugebauer model. Thanks to gamut mapping and juxtaposed halftoning, we create color images, which are invisible under daylight and have, under UV light, a high resemblance with the original images.	color	Roger D.

In this paper, we propose a hybrid system of coherent and incoherent modulation filtering for separation of the target speech from the interference. In the proposed system, subband envelopes are determined using a coherently detected subband carrier based on the time-dependent spectral Center-Of-Gravity (COG) demodulation and then the interference signal is eliminated by applying the adaptive Affine Projection (AP) filter to the subband envelop. The reference signal for the adaptive AP filter is provided by a parallel incoherent system of modulation filtering. Our evaluations, based on several objective measures, indicate that the proposed system extracts the majority of target speech signal segments with minimal interference, outperforming previous systems in voiced speech separation.	adaptive filter;coherence (physics);experiment;holographic principle;hybrid system;interference (communication);modulation	Azar Mahmoodzadeh;Hamid Sheikhzadeh;Hamid Reza Abutalebi;Hamid Soltanian-Zadeh	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6287883	filter;frequency modulation;adaptive filter;instantaneous phase;speech recognition;telecommunications;computer science;speech;speech processing;mathematics;interference;signal-to-noise ratio;modulation	Robotics	83.82777099831584	-34.61090115538064	193722

The technique used is to perform a spectral decomposition of noisy speech via channel vocoder filter bank analysis and to attenuate each spectral component depending on how much the measured speech plus noise power exceeds an estimate of the background noise. A two state model for the speech event (speech absent or speech present) is applied in determining the maximum likelihood estimator of the speech power. This model has resulted in a new class of suppression curves which permits a tradeoff of noise suppression against speech distortion. Experiments utilizing the real time implementation have shown that the noise can be made imperceptible by proper choice of the suppression factor. Integration of the noise suppression filter into the analysis section of a narrowband vocoder is described. This combined system represents an integrated robust vocoder structure where acoustic noise can be suppressed prior to pitch estimation and determination of the modulator gains.	real-time clock;speech enhancement;vocoder;zero suppression	Robert J.

The echoes, shifted in frequency according to the Doppler effect, are received, coherently demodulated and processed through a spectral estimator. The detected frequency shift can be exploited for blood velocity assessment. The spectral analysis is typically performed by the conventional Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), but, recently, the application of the Amplitude and Phase EStimator (APES) was proved to produce a good quality sonogram based on a reduced number of transmissions. Unfortunately, the much higher calculation effort needed by APES hampers its use in real-time applications. In this work, a fixed point DSP implementation of APES is presented. A spectral estimate - based on 32 transmissions - occurs in less than 120μs.

The performance of all bearing estimation techniques degrades under conditions of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the sensor array. The degradation may be arrested by denoising the array data before performing the task of bearing estimation. In the last few years, there has been considerable progress in the use of the wavelet transform for denoising signals. It is known that the traditional wavelet transform, which is a linear transformation, can be used for denoising signals in Gaussian noise; but this method is not suitable if the noise is strongly non-Gaussian. Statistical measurements of ocean acoustic ambient noise data indicate that the noise may have a significantly non-Gaussian heavy-tailed distribution in some environments. In this work, we have explored the possibility of employing nonlinear wavelet denoising [1, 2], a robust technique based on median interpolation, to improve the performance of bearing estimation techniques in ocean in a strongly non-Gaussian noise environment. We propose the application of nonlinear wavelet denoising to the noisy signal at each sensor in the array to boost the SNR before performing bearing estimation by known techniques such as MUSIC and Subspace Intersection Method [3]. Simulation results are presented to show that denoising leads to a significant reduction in the mean square errors (MSE) of the estimators, and enhancement of resolution of closely spaced sources.	acoustic cryptanalysis;elegant degradation;interpolation;mean squared error;noise reduction;nonlinear system;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;wavelet transform;white noise	N.

The processed subband signals are then combined for each channel to form the separated speech. Experimental results show that while the fullband ADF can achieve better separation performance after reaching convergence, the SBADF has the advantage of improved convergence rate and reduced computational complexity by a factor of approximately two.	decorrelation	Jonathan Huang;Kuan-Chieh Yen;Yunxin Zhao	2000	IEEE Trans.

We make use of multiple noise injections of short duration to estimate the filter coefficients of an appropriate order between the speaker and the microphone, in order to perform the feedback cancellation effectively in real-time. Our motive behind the development of this application is to perform an effective acoustic feedback cancellation irrespective of the position of speaker and the microphone on the platform under consideration. With the proposed application, we can estimate the transfer function between speaker and microphone in the changing room acoustics making the feedback cancellation very effective.

501df442828afacc7e09698ff72d24ccc7edd5d4	eeg-based auditory attention decoding using steerable binaural superdirective beamformer		During the last decades significant progress in multi-microphone speech enhancement algorithms has been made for hearing aids. However, the performance of many algorithms depends on identifying the target speaker to be enhanced. To identify the target speaker from single-trial EEG recordings in an acoustic scenario with two competing speakers, an auditory attention decoding (AAD) method was recently proposed. This AAD method however requires the clean speech signals of both the attended and the unattended speaker as reference signals for decoding. Since in practice only microphone signals, containing several undesired acoustic components, are available, in this paper we explore the potential of using steerable binaural superdirective beamformer for generating appropriate reference signals for decoding. The experimental results show that using steerable superdirective beamformer output signals improves the decoding performance compared to using the noisy microphone signals as reference signals.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;beamforming;binaural beats;electroencephalography;microphone;speech enhancement;steerable filter	Ali Aroudi;Daniel Marquardt;Simon Doclo	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2018.8462278	speech recognition;noise measurement;decoding methods;binaural recording;electroencephalography;microphone;artificial intelligence;pattern recognition;speech enhancement;computer science	ML	84.10969911274383	-35.06955247944897	197384
0eff2296c52e2751b6ddd029737e37c1700b7e83	a sparse spherical harmonic-based model in subbands for head-related transfer functions		Several functional models for head-related transfer function (HRTF) have been proposed based on spherical harmonic (SH) orthogonal functions, which yield an encouraging performance level in terms of log-spectral distortion (LSD). However, since the properties of subbands are quite different and highly subjectdependent, the degree of SH expansion should be adapted to the subband and the subject, which is quite challenging. In this paper, a sparse spherical harmonic-based model termed SSHM is proposed in order to achieve an intelligent frequency truncation. Different from SH-based model (SHM) which assigns the degree for each subband, SSHM constrains the number of SH coefficients by using an l1 penalty, and automatically preserves the significant coefficients in each subband. As a result, SSHM requires less coefficients at the same SD level than other truncation methods to reconstruct HRTFs . Furthermore, when used for interpolation, SSHM gives a better fitting precision since it naturally reduces the influence of the fluctuation caused by the movement of the subject and the processing error. The experiments show that even using about 40% less coefficients, SSHM has a slightly lower LSD than SHM. Therefore, SSHM can achieve a better tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy.	coefficient;distortion;experiment;head-related transfer function;interpolation;quantum fluctuation;sparse matrix;super high material cd;truncation	Xiaoke Qi;Jianhua Tao	2016		10.21437/Interspeech.2016-987	mathematical optimization;speech recognition;machine learning	ML	87.3038533386807	-33.49080492840613	199068

The mode content of a multipath is estimated using Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation based on a receiving array delay vector. The model analysis allows a defect to be located by employing both the mode estimates and a ML estimation of the shear and longitudinal propagation angles. Some aspects of the attendant processing hardware are also discussed.	broadcast delay	J. Pearson;C. J. Macleod;Tariq S.

To overcome the nonuniqueness problem, a stereo shaker is introduced in eight frequency bands and adjusted so as to be inaudible and not affect stereo perception. A duo-filter control system including a continually running adaptive filter and a fixed filter is used for double-talk control. A second-order stereo projection algorithm is used in the adaptive filter. A stereo voice switch is also included. This stereo echo canceller was tested in two-way conversation in a conference room, and the strength of the stereo shaker was subjectively adjusted. A misalignment of 20 dB was obtained in the teleconferencing environment, and changing the talker’s position in the transmission room did not affect the cancellation. This echo canceller is now used daily in a high-presence teleconferencing system and has been demonstrated to more than 300 attendees.	adaptive filter;algorithm;control system;echo suppression and cancellation;frequency band;loss of significance	Suehiro Shimauchi;Shoji Makino;Youichi Haneda;Akira Nakagawa;Sumitaka Sakauchi	1999		10.1109/ICASSP.1999.759806	adaptive filter;computer vision;speech recognition;computer science;control system	Robotics	85.12710331882782	-33.75099494834837	199698

One of the activities is promotion of agricultural and livestock products. However, Miyazaki prefecture is very far from large-scale consumption areas such as Tokyo and Osaka. To keep freshness of agricultural and livestock products during their transport is a serious problem from a viewing of putrefaction due to blight outbreak. Apple Mango has been a very famous and representative product in Miyazaki prefecture and it has successfully continued to make a good profit. However, fruit rot disease such as Anthrax Pathogen after harvest is serious [1] [2] [3]. Therefore, a sterilization technique is strongly required. We here generated the dielectric barrier discharge plasma in water mist, which may possible to sterilize the whole of greengrocery because of its high diffusibility. We examined fungicidal activity against Colletotrichum sp.	discharger;mango;plasma active;replay attack;software rot	Masaru Tominaga;Toshiyuki Tanaka;Tatsuya Sakoda;Norikazu Mizoguchi;Yoshiyuki Kushima	2015	2015 IIAI 4th International Congress on Advanced Applied Informatics	10.1109/IIAI-AAI.2015.244	environmental engineering;biotechnology;engineering;waste management	AI	86.29635796431235	-51.66533421020562	199892
