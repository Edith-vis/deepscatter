Outbreaks of RSV occur every year and all children become infected within the first two years of life, and that overloads hospital casualty services. The transmission dynamics of RSV are strongly seasonal. Epidemics occur each winter in temperate climates and often coincide with the seasonal rainfall in tropical climates. In this paper we develop a non-standard numerical scheme for a SIRS seasonal epidemiological model for RSV transmission. This non-standard numerical scheme preserves the positivity of the continuous model and is applied to approximate the solution using different sizes of step. Finally this method is compared with some well-known explicit methods and simulations with data from Gambia and Finland are carried out. c © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The approach utilizes equation of state, incorporates solid phase and is successful in generation of type VI phase diagram. The procedure enables automatic generation of GPED which incorporates calculations of all important landmarks such as critical endpoints ( CEP ), quadruple point ( QP , if any), critical azeotropic points ( CAP ), azeotropic endpoints ( AEP ), pure azeotropic points ( PAP ), critical line, liquid–liquid–vapor line ( L  1  L  2  V , if any), solid–liquid–liquid line ( SL  1  L  2 , if any), solid–liquid–vapor line ( SLV ) and azeotropic line. The proposed strategy is completely general in that it does not require any knowledge about the type of phase diagram and can be applied to any pressure explicit equation of state model. The overall methodology include predictor-corrector method for line tracing, homotopy continuation for critical point calculations and phase stability test, automatic differentiation to calculate derivatives and trust region dogleg approach to compute thermodynamic landmark such as critical endpoints and quadruple points.	phase diagram;starflight	Keyur S.

While using the shearing method a cut edge is usually created which often clearly fails to meet the desired quality. The optimum cut edge quality is as rectangular and as burr-free as possible. Trials made at the IFUM showed, that the quality of cut edges can be improved by overlaying the movement of the punch with an oscillation. Through different test rows the mechanism and impact of oscillation on the shearing process are investigated. This paper reports about tensile and friction tests made on sheet metal with oscillation overlay, high speed cutting tests and test series with a new designed tool which allows stamping sheet metal also with an oscillation overlay. The test series show, that oscillation can have an effect on the tensile strength, friction and work hardening of sheet metal and as a result on the cutting force and the cut edge quality.

We show that the remaining loss is predominantly due to impedance mismatch at the boundaries between patterned and unpatterned slab waveguide regions.

The fabricated sensor consists of a taste sensor chip (40 mm × 26 mm × 2.2 mm) with working and reference electrodes and a portable sensor device (80 mm × 25 mm × 20 mm). The working electrode consists of a taste-sensing site comprising a poly(hydroxyethyl)methacrylate (pHEMA) hydrogel layer with KCl as the electrolyte layer and a lipid/polymer membrane as the taste sensing element. The reference electrode comprises a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) membrane layer with a small hole and a pHEMA layer with KCl. The whole device is the size of a USB memory stick, making it suitable for portable use. The sensor's response to tannic acid as the standard astringency substance showed good accuracy and reproducibility, and was comparable with the performance of a commercially available taste sensing system. Thus, it is possible for this sensor to be used for in-field evaluations and it can make a significant contribution to the food industry, as well as in various fields of research.	chloride ion;eighty;evaluation;experiment;food processing industry;hydrogel;kcl compound;laptop;lipid a;multi-function printer;polymer;polyvinyl chloride;polyvinyls;potassium chloride;sensor;tannic acid;tissue membrane;usb flash drive;electrode	Yusuke Tahara;Kenichi Nakashi;Ke Ji;Akihiro Ikeda;Kiyoshi Toko	2013		10.3390/s130101076	biochemistry;electronics;taste;chemistry;membrane potential;electrical engineering;electrode;analytical chemistry;nanotechnology	Mobile	94.10936648917726	-17.706143262486286	18758

For this purpose the catalytic chemical vapor deposition, which has already been approved to work on SiO2 surfaces [1], is used to grow graphene. First electrical results indicate a bilayer graphene with an on/off current ratio of 103 to 104, which can be achieved with lower threshold voltages. A greater on/off current ratio may be possible, as the off current is degraded through gate leakage current.	bilayer graphene;cmos;combustion chemical vapor deposition;field effect (semiconductor);high-κ dielectric;spectral leakage;transistor;vacuum deposition	D.

It is composed of an array of decentralized blocks that contain MEMS valves. We are interested in the dynamics of the optimal path between two blocks in the surface. The criteria used for optimal paths are related to the degradation of the MEMS, namely its remaining useful life and its transfer time. We study and analyze the evolution of the optimal path in dynamic conditions in order to maintain as long as possible a good performance of the conveying surface. Simulations show that during usage the number of optimal paths increases, and that position of sources greatly influences surface lifetime.	computer simulation;elegant degradation;microelectromechanical systems;software brittleness	Haithem Skima;Eugen Dedu;Julien Bourgeois;Christophe Varnier;Kamal Medjaher	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-39639-2_35	control engineering;microelectromechanical systems;computer science	Robotics	87.76200851219052	-8.46476809840236	19089
6ce6429fbc68c1193eedd19a0b5a2a0b0d7fcf97	sand transverse dune aerodynamics: 3d coherent flow structures from a computational study		The engineering interest about dune fields is dictated by the their interaction with a number of human infrastructures in arid environments. Sand dunes dynamics is dictated by wind and its ability to induce sand erosion, transport and deposition. A deep understanding of dune aerodynamics serves then to ground effective strategies for the protection of human infrastructures from sand, the so-called sand mitigation. Because of their simple geometry and their frequent occurrence in desert area, transverse sand dunes are usually adopted in literature as a benchmark to investigate dune aerodynamics by means of both computational or experimental approaches, usually in nominally 2D setups. The present study aims at evaluating 3D flow features in the wake of a idealised transverse dune, if any, under different nominally 2D setup conditions by means of computational simulations and to compare the obtained results with experimental measurements available in literature.	arid;benchmark (computing);coherent;common weakness enumeration;computation;computer simulation;erosion (morphology);full scale;physical vapor deposition;relevance;self-replicating machine;transverse wave	Luca Bruno;Davide Fransos	2015	CoRR		simulation;engineering;geotechnical engineering	ML	87.07430628128844	-5.580501245323973	19092

The entropy generation due to the use of a magnetic field and porous medium effects on heat transfer, fluid friction, and mass transfer have been analyzed numerically. Using a similarity transformation, the governing equations of continuity, momentum, and energy and concentration equations, of nonlinear system, were reduced to a set of ordinary differential equations and solved numerically. The effects of unsteadiness parameter, magnetic field parameter, porosity parameter, heat generation/absorption parameter, Lewis number, chemical reaction parameter, and Brinkman number parameter on the velocity, the temperature, the concentration, and the entropy generation rates profiles were investigated and the results were presented graphically.

cdb3e213497e570802cb9c748730fc841760cae0	a hybrid readout solution for gan-based detectors using cmos technology †	3d integration;cmos technology;gallium nitride (gan);uv imaging;avalanche photodiodes (apds);capacitive transimepdance amplifier (ctia);hybridization	Gallium nitride (GaN) and its alloys are becoming preferred materials for ultraviolet (UV) detectors due to their wide bandgap and tailorable out-of-band cutoff from 3.4 eV to 6.2 eV. GaN based avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are particularly suitable for their high photon sensitivity and quantum efficiency in the UV region and for their inherent insensitivity to visible wavelengths. Challenges exist however for practical utilization. With growing interests in such photodetectors, hybrid readout solutions are becoming prevalent with CMOS technology being adopted for its maturity, scalability, and reliability. In this paper, we describe our approach to combine GaN APDs with a CMOS readout circuit, comprising of a linear array of 1 × 8 capacitive transimpedance amplifiers (CTIAs), implemented in a 0.35 µm high voltage CMOS technology. Further, we present a simple, yet sustainable circuit technique to allow operation of APDs under high reverse biases, up to ≈80 V with verified measurement results. The readout offers a conversion gain of 0.43 µV/e-, obtaining avalanche gains up to 10³. Several parameters of the CTIA are discussed followed by a perspective on possible hybridization, exploiting the advantages of a 3D-stacked technology.	accident due to avalanche, landslide, or mudslide;alloys;amplifiers (electronics);avalanche effect;avalanches;cmos;ctia and gtia;capability maturity model;detectors;entity name part qualifier - adopted;lambda calculus;nucleic acid hybridization;out-of-band agreement;photons;p–n junction;scalability;solutions;transimpedance amplifier;gallium nitride;interest;voltage	Preethi Padmanabhan;Bruce Hancock;Shouleh Nikzad;L.

The turbulence effects have been taking into account by Large Eddy Simulation (LES), using the Smagorinsky model as the sub-grid scale turbulent model and the Van Driest model for the wall damping. Firstly, the code has been validated at real operating diesel engine conditions with experimental data in terms of mass flow, momentum flux and effective velocity, showing that the model is able to predict with a high level of confidence the behavior of the internal flow at cavitating conditions. Once validated, the code has allowed to study in depth the turbulence developed in the discharge orifices and its interaction with cavitation phenomenon.	computation;diesel;discharger;high-level programming language;large eddy simulation;turbulence;velocity (software development)	F.

9bd30ee3a42e9d3bafda4f6295315b6503cba52a	fast cooling for a system of stochastic oscillators		We study feedback control of a system of coupled nonlinear stochastic oscillators in a force field. We first consider the problem of asymptotically driving the system to a desired steady state corresponding to lower thermal noise. Among the feedback controls achieving the desired asymptotic transfer, we find that the most efficient one from an energy point of view is characterized by time-reversibility. We also extend the theory of the Schrödinger bridges to this model thereby steering the system in finite time and with minimum effort to a target steady-state distribution. The system can then be maintained in this state through the optimal steady-state feedback control. The solution, in the finite-horizon case, involves a space-time harmonic function φ and − logφ plays the role of an artificial, time-varying potential in which the desired evolution occurs. This framework appears extremely general and flexible and can be viewed as a considerable generalization of existing active control strategies such as macromolecular cooling. In the case of a quadratic potential, the results assume a form particularly attractive from the algorithmic viewpoint as the optimal control can be computed via deterministic matricial differential equations. An example involving inertial particles illustrates both transient and steady state optimal feedback control.	computer cooling;feedback;force field (chemistry);johnson–nyquist noise;nonlinear system;optimal control;quantum harmonic oscillator;reversible computing;schrödinger;steady state	Yongxin Chen;Tryphon T.

Salient features of the comparison are briefly summarized. Some implications of the recently reported specific heat anomaly for indium are discussed. • Laboratory of Atomic and Solid State Physics, Department of Physics, CorneJJ University, Ithaca, New York; permanent address: Physics Department, University of Illinois, Urbana. Illinois. From the thermodynamic reversibility of the superconducting transition it follows that the magnetic and calorimetric properties of a superconductor are related by the equation! where h = He!Ho and t = T/Te• This function describes the deviation of the experimental values of He from those expected at the same temperature according to the """"parabolic law"""". Values of D( t) are obtained directly from He measurements with a precision of about 5 %. Since D(t) itself amounts to only about 2 to 3% of Ho, He measurements of high precision are required for this type of analysis. Curves where S; and S5are the molar entropies in the normal and superconducting states, V is the molar volume, He is the critical magnetic field, and T is the absolute temperature. The accuracy with which this equation applies to available experimental data has been examined to establish the conditions of measurement most likely to yield the true thermodynamic properties of a superconductor. Because of the completeness and excellence of the available calorimetric data, primary attention was given to the elements tin and indium. Detailed comparisons were made of entropy and specific heat values from both magnetic/ and calorimetric data"""":"""" in the range from T; to about 1 Preliminary data from measurements extending to about O.3°K have also been considered.

A straightforward thermodynamic argument shows that D(t) may be regarded as specifying a small perturbation in the temperature dependence of l1SP, where l1SP is the entropy difference corresponding to the fiducial parabolic He curve assumed in calculating D(t). The relationship is illustrated in Fig. 2, where the dotted curve represents the temperature dependence of l1SP• The solid curves show the qualitative variation of l1S with T for two extreme cases; tin, which shows a negative D(t), and lead, for which D(t) is positive.

Early diagnosis is the key to successfully treating many diseases. Nanomaterial-based biosensors utilize the unique properties of biological and physical nanomaterials to recognize a target molecule and effect transduction of an electronic signal. In general, the advantages of nanomaterial-based biosensors are fast response, small size, high sensitivity, and portability compared to existing large electrodes and sensors. Systems integration is the core technology that enables tiny medicine. Integration of nanomaterials, microfluidics, automatic samplers, and transduction devices on a single chip provides many advantages for point of care devices such as biosensors. Biosensors are also being used as new analytical tools to study medicine. Thus this paper reviews how nanomaterials can be used to build biosensors and how these biosensors can help now and in the future to detect disease and monitor therapies.	biological markers;biosensors;cell signaling;early diagnosis;gene regulatory network;microfluidics;nanostructured materials;point-of-care systems;software portability;system integration;tiny basic;transduction (machine learning);electrode;sensor (device)	Yeo-Heung Yun;Edward Eteshola;Amit Bhattacharya;Zhongyun Dong;Joon-Sub Shim;Laura Conforti;Dogyoon Kim;Mark J.

In this note we showcase one particular example van der Waals interactions between two cylindrical bodies relevant to modeling of carbon nanotube systems. The potential is viewed as a tensor (multidimensional table) which is represented in compact form with the help of tensor train decomposition. The described approach offers a universal solution for the description of Coulomb and van der Waals interactions between complex-shaped nanostructures and can be used within the framework of such systems of mesoscale modeling as recently emerged mesoscopic distinct element method (MDEM).	approximation;fundamental interaction;mesoscopic physics	Grigoriy M.

When a tab is added to the jet, an increase in the fundamental screech frequency is observed in acoustic spectra. High resolution schlieren imaging reveals alteration of both the shock structure and preferred instability mode in the jet. Two-point spatial correlation of schlieren images shows the transition from a lateral flapping mode to a punctuated toroid screech mode. This change in dominant instability mode produces a change in coherent structure wavelength that correlates well to the observed screech frequency shift in the acoustic data. The high quality of the schlieren images also allows the counter-rotating vortex pair produced by an individual tab to be identified. Images of the radial density gradient are used to estimate vortex pair location, and a statistical estimate for the trajectory of the vortex pair is produced. The vortex pair path identification technique shows that the path of the vortex pair is constrained close to the exit of the nozzle and increasingly variant in space with greater downstream distance. The vortex trajectory is shown to alter the sonic line and thus the spatial extent of the embedded shock structures.		Nicholas J. Johnston;Daniel M. Mitchell	2016	J.

72e3a499c1a78b693ca52cb7e7d848e2ed4cdbcc	using a domain theory to guide automated modeling of complex physical phenomena	domain theory	"""Choosing appropriate models is crucial in analyzing complex physical phenomena, especial ly when supercomput ing resources and complex par t ia l dif ferential equations are involved. This paper presents an approach to fo rmula t ing mathemat ica l models guided by the structure of a domain theory and the gross behavior of a physical problem. The approach is mot ivated by the observation that many physical domains, though complex and computat ional ly expensive to analyze, have strong domain theories based on a few fundamenta l conservation laws and well-defined physical processes. Furthermore, model ing decisions have to be guided by the behavior specific to a physical problem that the system is t r y i ng to model .

The impact is even more significant in analyzing complex physical phenomena that require h igh performance and supercomput ing resources. A few crucial approximat ions can t ransform complex par t ia l differential equations to ordinary different ial equations or algebraic equations, w i th the differences in resource requirements between supercomputers and workstat ions. Th is paper describes an approach to fo rmula t ing models. The models include not only algebraic and ordinary differential equations for model ing lumped phenomena, but also partial dif ferential equations for model ing dist r ibuted phenomena, i.e. values of physical phenomena vary w i t h t ime and spatial dimensions. Th is approach is based on two principles: • the use of the structure of a domain theory to focus the approximat ions on choosing the types and the number of basic physical processes, and — to sequence the model ing process around the structure of the conservation laws. • the use of the gross behavior of a physical phenomenon, obtained through simple approximate models, to guide its model ing decisions. The approach is targeted to domains where strong domain theories exist and s imple approximate models for est imat ing gross behavior are available. It is mot ivated by the observation that many physical domains have strong and well-defined domain theories f rom which models are derived. These domain theories are based on several fundamenta l conservation laws and well-defined physical processes that are governed by domain-specific laws. Examples of these domains are heat transfer, fluid mechanics and st ructura l analysis where the laws of conservation of mass, of energy, and of momen tum are the fundamenta l laws and the domain-specific laws relate the basic processes of mass, energy and momen tum to the properties of materials in their respective domains. By organizing the model ing process around the structure of a domain theory, we can provide an un i fo rm approach to fo rmula t ing models of various complexi ty. The approach is also mot iva ted by the need of incorporat ing problem specific behavior of physical phenomena into model ing decisions. A model reflects the behavior 1766 QUALITATIVE REASONING AND DIAGNOSIS of a physical problem at hand and the decisions behind the models have to be made w i th in the context of the behavior. Bu t how do we obta in the problem specific behavior to guide the model ing decisions? Simple and approximate models exist in a domain that can be used to obta in the gross behavior of a problem. These models only give the estimates of the gross behavior of a problem, e.g., the m a x i m u m temperature drop instead of the temperature d is t r ibu t ion in a sol id. However, these models are simple to compute, and the gross behavior is often adequate for mak ing the model ing decisions. Using the gross behavior of a prob lem, obtained f rom these approximate models, allows a system to quickly focus on a l ikely candidate model for the problem at hand. The approach has been implemented in a computer program, MSG (Model Selection and Generation), which formulates mathemat ica l models in the heat transfer doma in . The models in this domain involve algebraic, ordinary and par t ia l differential equations, for model ing lumped and d is t r ibuted heat transfer phenomena. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 in t roduces the domain theory of heat transfer and its im plications for organizing the model ing process. Section 3 presents the gross behavior of heat transfer and the methods for obta in ing them. Section 4 describes the program MSG implement ing this approach and an example problem. Section 5 describes several features of this approach. Section 6 compares this approach w i th related work, fol lowed by the summary in Section 7. 2 Model ing Process Structured by Domain Theory Many complex physical domains have well-developed doma in theories that are based on several fundamental conservation laws and a set of physical processes defined by domain specific laws. The basic physical processes are the under ly ing concepts and entities. They are related to other physical properties in the domain through the domain specific laws. The conservation laws govern the interactions of these basic processes, and dictate how these processes are composed in to a model. Heat transfer is one of these domains. In the domain of heat transfer, the fundamenta l law is the conservation of energy and the three basic processes are conduction, convection and radiat ion heat transfer, defined by the Fourier's law of conduct ion, the Newton's law of convection and the Stefan-Boltzmann law of radiat ion. When a temperature gradient is imposed on an object f rom its environment, instances of the basic heat transfer processes occur and their interact ion is governed by the law of conservation of energy. Th is law says that the net change of energy stored w i t h i n any bounded region of space, i.e., a cont ro l region , is equal to the net heat f low in to the region plus any internal heat generation w i th in the region. A l l mathemat ica l models, regardless of their complexity, are based on this conservation law. One way to view this conservation law is in the fo rm 1 Also called a control volume of where Q,s represent instances of basic heat transfer processes act ing on surfaces of the region or internal heat generation processes w i t h i n the region, and E represents internal energy change or energy storage w i t h i n that region. Regardless of the complexi ty of heat transfer models and the various forms in which the models appear, al l of them can be traced to this fo rm. Th is general and yet simple fo rm has two impl icat ions for the model ing process. The first imp l ica t ion is for the approx imat ion decisions. Since a model is a representat ion of this conservation law and the physical processes instant iated for a region in space, the choice of these processes w i l l affect the final fo rm of the model . Various types and number of processes can be chosen. A model representing a few physical processes is less complex. Simi lar ly, a model representing lumped processes, i.e. processes which are assumed constant w i t h respect to t ime and space, is less complex than a model representing differential processes, i.e. processes varying w i t h respect to t ime and space. In other words, the complexi ty of a model depends on the choices of processes, and a l l the approximat ions in this domain are focused on choos­ ing the types and the number of processes. A corol lary to the focus of choosing physical processes is that the model ing process is compositional at the level of physical processes. The conservation law provides a template to put an arb i t rary number of processes together once they are chosen. Processes are put in the r ight or left hand sides of the equation depending on their types. The fo rm of a model depends on the choices of physical processes. However, these processes depend on the type of a control region where the conservation law is instant iated and the type of query that a model is supposed to answer. Th is dependency constrains how model ing choices should be made. In other words, the modeling decisions and approximat ions are not to ta l ly independent of one another. Some of the decisions are constrained by earlier decisions. Th is dependency suggests a way to organize the model ing process in the fol lowing sequence. 1. F i rs t , decide on the control regions of an object. 2. For each control region, ident i fy the potent ia l act ive heat transfer and energy storage processes, and make approximat ions on them. 3.

Some of the factors mentioned here also contribute in the selection of optical fiber as a powerful sensor. The type of sensor that can be designed varies for the type of application it is needed in. This paper shows how optical fiber is used for remote measurement of strain/stress. The quantity measured is the soil pressure, which is identified to be the key factor in determining the possible occurrence of a landslide, a destructive natural disaster which occurs commonly here in South East Asian nations such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. The optical sensing technique proposed and used in the developed applications in this paper and consequent research is the light intensity modulation and the micro bending technique. Both the techniques are tested under the same conditions and environment and it is found that both techniques have their advantages and disadvantages, where none characteristics can be discarded for this research. An ordinary type laser has been used as the light source in both the sensors. Similarly a light dependent resistor is used for light detection purposes. A suitable microcontroller will be selected for the task of processing a single input from a selected sensor fiber, and displays the output over a LCD, together with soil status displayed via LED. The hardware and the software are then combined together in the prototype hardware to characterize a working model of the system. Cost wise, both the sensors have nearly equal expenditure. Although this complete and ongoing research project covers theoretical, design and testing of the optical fiber sensors as well as the selection, programming and simulation of the selected microcontroller, and the outcome of the completed system, this paper will concentrate on the theoretical selection by elimination and to prove that the light intensity modulation and the micro bending technique are the best fiber optic techniques for stress/strain measurement.	image sensor;liquid-crystal display;microcontroller;modulation;optical fiber;prototype;simulation	Uma Gunasilan;Thenesh Gunasilan	2009	2009 Ninth IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology	10.1109/CIT.2009.139	telecommunications;computer science;optical fiber	Mobile	90.83965731199653	-22.33738209231263	19925

The test results derived for samples containing single individual odorants at a wide range of concentrations are initially used to define the empirical relationship between the dilution-to-threshold (D/T) ratio and odor intensity (OI) scaling. Based on these relationships, the D/T ratios were estimated for each odorant with the same intensity as the synthetic mixture. The relative contribution of each odorant to such mixture is then assessed by comparing the estimated and measured D/T values. This stepwise test confirmed the dominance of certain compounds at a given OI rating. In the case of M(2), H(2)S showed sensitive detection at high OI range, while AA did so at low end. The pattern of a competing relationship is also seen consistently from M(6) between AA (low) and iso-valeraldehyde (IA: high OI range). The overall results thus suggest that the masking phenomena between strong odorants should proceed under competing relationships, if released at the same time.	acetaldehyde;aldehydes;composition;experiment;f 7302;iso 3166;image scaling;isoproterenol;odorants;odors;opportunistic infections;osteogenesis imperfecta;qualitative comparative analysis;quantitation;radiotherapy, intensity-modulated;sensor;sensorimotor cortex;simulation;stepwise regression;synthetic intelligence;mixture;pentanal	Ki-Hyun Kim	2010		10.3390/s100807287	chemistry;air;analytical chemistry;physics	ML	97.01379149790652	-18.170936272868587	20075

We use the Newton–Raphson method of the MM3 molecular mechanics program to scan the conformational spaces of a model molecule and a real molecule. The results show each energy minimum, maximum point, and saddle point has a basin of initial points converging to it in conformational spaces. Points converging to different extrema are mixed, and form fractal structures around basin boundaries. Singular points seem to involve in the formation of fractal. When searching within a small region of fractal basin boundaries, the self-similarity of fractal makes it possible to find all energy minima, maxima, and saddle points from which global minimum may be extracted. Compared with other methods, this approach is efficient, accurate, conceptually simple, and easy to implement. © 2000 John Wiley u0026 Sons, Inc.

This paper describes a method for a measurement of the magnetic field affecting the direction of the electron beam. It consists of the analysis of SEM images that are registered for several distances between the final aperture of an electron column and a specimen. Means of the measurement of a constant and a periodic magnetic field are explained. The presented examples show the results of the measurement of the constant field that is generated by coils that are placed either inside or outside the microscope chassis. The results are compared with the ones obtained using a reference magnetometer. In the presented method, a direct magnetic field influence on the electron beam is separated from any other influences. Also, the magnetic field nonuniformity along the electron beam path is considered. The current investigations enable the magnetic field compensation and test the shielding efficiency of the SEM chassis.	3d scanner;biological specimen;chassis;distortion;electron	Mariusz Pluska;Lukasz Oskwarek;Remigiusz J.

It is known that cyanobacteria appeared about 3.5 billion years ago and that Earth's rotational speed is continuously decreasing because of tidal friction. What is the effect of the continuous slowdown of Earth's rotation on the operation of the cyanobacterial oscillator? To answer this question we derived the oscillator's equation of motion directly from experimental data, coupled it with Earth's rotation and computed its natural periods and its resonance curve. The results show that there are two resonance peaks of the """"cyanobacterial oscillator-rotating Earth"""" system, indicating that cyanobacteria used more efficiently the solar energy during the geological period in which the day length varied from about 11 to 15h and make more efficient use of solar energy at the geological period which started with a day length of 21h and will end at a day length of 28h."""	crystal oscillator;cyanobacteria;experiment;friction;onset (audio);oscillator (cellular automaton);oscillator device component;oxygen;resonance;solar energy;oxidation	Ioannis G.

The synthesised N-(Rhodamine-B)-lactam-ethylenediamine (RhB-EDA) fluorescent probe shows interesting optical sensor properties, and high sensitivity and selectivity to Ag⁺ ions among all the tested metal ions (K⁺, Mg2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Fe2+, Pb2+, Na⁺, Mn2+, Li⁺, Al3+, Co2+, Hg2+, Sr2+, Ca2+, Ag⁺, Cd2+ and Zn2+), while the well-known Rhodamine B (RhB) fluorescent probe shows much less sensitivity to Ag⁺ ions, but high sensitivity to Fe2+ ions. The novel fluorescent sensor probe RhB-EDA has the capabilities to sense Ag⁺ ions up to µM ranges by using the fluorescence quenching approach. The probe displayed a dynamic response to Ag⁺ in the range of 0.43 × 10-3-10-6 M with a detection limit of 0.1 μM. The sensing system of an RhB-EDA novel fluorescent probe was optimised according to the spectral properties, effect of pH and buffer, photostability, incubation time, sensitivity, and selectivity. Since all the spectral and sensing properties were tested in green aqueous media, although many other similar sensor systems rely on organic solvent solutions, the RhB-EDA sensing probe may be a good candidate for measuring Ag⁺ ions in real-life applications.	buffers;calcium ion;ethylenediamines;fast green fcf stain;ferrous;fluorescence;image sensor;ions;limit of detection;manganese cation (2+);mercury 2+;metals;organic solvent product;pb2+;photostability drug study;probe effect;real life;rhodamine b;selectivity (electronic);sol-gel;solutions;structural modifier;whole earth 'lectronic link;aluminum cation;cobaltous cation;cupric cation;technetium tc 99m ethylenediamine;zinc cation	Eva Sorsak;Julija Volmajer Valh;Spela Korent Urek;Aleksandra Lobnik	2018		10.3390/s18041201	ethylenediamine;analytical chemistry;engineering;fluorescence;rhodamine b;solvent;metal ions in aqueous solution;ion;aqueous solution;photochemistry;quenching (fluorescence)	Mobile	95.23396080985842	-17.32308589920302	20378

The method is used to predict the pKa values of five carboxylic acids (Asp7, Glu10, Glu19, Asp27, and Glu43) in turkey ovomucoid third domain (OMTKY3), and six aspartates residues (Asp 22, Asp 44, Asp 54, Asp 75, Asp 83, and Asp 93) in barnase. For OMTKY3, all the predicted pKa values are within 1 pH units from the available experimental ones, except for the case of Glu 43. For barnase, the root-mean-square deviation from experiment is 1.46 pH units. As a result, the proposed pKa calculation method correctly reproduces the relative order of the pKa values among the carboxylic acids located in different sites of the proteins. The calculated pKa values are decomposed into the contributions of short- and long-range structural difference effects. The results indicate that in both proteins the pKa value of the given carboxylic acid is partially influenced by long-range interactions with distant charged residues, which significantly contribute to determining the relative order of the pKa values. The current methodology based on LSMO provides us useful information about the titration behavior in a protein.	aspartate;bacillus amyloliquefaciens ribonuclease;cns disorder;carboxylic acids;charge (electrical);cluster analysis;computational complexity theory;computer cluster;interaction;molecular orbital;ovomucin;population parameter;protons;qm/mm;quantum mechanics;simulation;staphylococcal protein a;test scaling;titration method;orders - hl7publishingdomain;statistical cluster;supercomputer	Kazuki Ohno;Minoru Sakurai	2006	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.20372	stereochemistry;chemistry;linear scale;protein pka calculations;computational chemistry	Comp.	97.35517324704531	-5.024448031111403	20595

Besides formal requirements of assembly processes, the tools for c ontrollable manipulation with these objects should not affect the examined micro/ nano environment, i.e. should be “small and passive” in any sense. Despite of the rec nt progress, most available micro-grippers are still suffering of high voltage power supply required, short lifetime, low detection sensitivity and high price. Prototypes of a newly designed micro-gripper, havin g advantages over the existing analogues, have been developed, experiment ally s udied, and presented in this paper. The envisaged microgripper is of normal ly-closed type with thermomechanically driven actuator and piezoresistive arm -displacement feedback. The thermo actuator is placed between gripper’s arms an d consists of double-folded highly-doped compliant silicon beam. As low average voltage vs. arm displacement value as 1V/ μm, was experimentally measured.	coat of arms;displacement mapping;doping (semiconductor);experiment;gnu nano;ibm notes;jaws scripting language;power supply;prototype;requirement;robot end effector;smt placement equipment	Vladimir Stavrov;Emil Tomerov;Chavdar Hardalov;Daniel Danchev;Kostadin Kostadinov;Galina Stavreva;Evstati Apostolov;Assen Shulev;Anna Andonova;Mohammed Al-Wahab	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-11598-1_24	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering	Robotics	88.7402622412177	-18.515494142604833	20638

27f3c12d35e050d1a9195dc154d6699f297ffa1f	deployment of inductance-based pulsating sensor toward development of measurement technique for ovality in pipe	voltage 5 v inductance based pulsating sensor ovality meter inductor ferrite core lc type logic gate oscillator sensor position pipe diameter measurement pulse frequency liquid crystal display embedded processor position measurement;oscillators;logic gates;ferrites;pulse frequency inductor logic gate oscillator lgo microcontroller ovality pulsating sensor;position measurement;inductors;sensors diameter measurement ferrites inductance inductors liquid crystal displays logic gates pipes position measurement;inductance;clamps;ferrites inductors clamps position measurement oscillators inductance logic gates	This paper presents a handheld robust battery-operated contact-based ovality meter suitable for the measurement of ovality in pipeline in a plant site or in any industrial establishment. The ovality meter is mainly composed of a specially designed inductor with ferrite core. This inductor constitutes the part of an LC-type logic gate oscillator (LGO). A change in the sensor position during the measurement of pipe diameter causes a small change in inductance, which in turn changes the pulse frequency of the LGO when it is powered by 5 V dc. Thus, frequency, the output of the instrument that is displayed on the liquid crystal display of the embedded processor, is a function of displacement. By measuring the diameter of pipe specimen at different locations, the ovality is computed. In the present design, the range of position measurement is about 25 mm. The sensitivity in position measurement up to 10 mm is ~850 Hz/mm, which further reduces in higher range (>10 to 25 mm). Such a sensitivity in the position measurement seems to be quite suitable for ovality measurement.	biological specimen;displacement mapping;embedded system;ferrite (magnet);handheld game console;image resolution;liquid-crystal display;logic gate;magnetic-core memory;ovality;pipeline (unix);point of view (computer hardware company);power supply;pulse (signal processing);reactor (software);rotating calipers;rugged computer;sensor;system of measurement	Sanga Ramesh;Masila Pandiasankar Rajiniganth;Parashuram Sahoo	2016	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2016.2526637	control engineering;electronic engineering;logic gate;inductance;engineering;electrical engineering;ferrite;oscillation;inductor;physics;quantum mechanics	Embedded	90.84005667074157	-19.965388394094617	21002

One such method, is the relaxation element method, which maintains an unambiguous connection between the stress-drop in the local volume of a solid with plastic deformation in it. Based on this method and with combination of cellular automata approach a simulation of the evolution of band structures in polycrystals has been studied. The model can be referred to the class of geometrical models, known as cellular automata. Physical principles, laid on the basis of the model, allowed to reveal in the simulated polycrystals self-organization of the band structures and the regularities of the development of localization patterns, observed in experiments. The fundamental property of a solid: ”plastic deformation in the local volumes of solid is accompanied by stress relaxation in it” lies in the basis of the method.	automata theory;cellular automaton;electronic band structure;experiment;internationalization and localization;linear programming relaxation;relaxation (approximation);self-organization;simulation;stress ball	G.

The coupled non-linear partial differential equations in non-dimensional form have been solved by implicit finite difference method of Crank-Nicolson type. The influence of magnetic parameter and magnetic Prandtl number on the velocity, temperature and induced magnetic field at a fixed cross-section, as well as on the skin-friction and Nusselt number on the heated surface, have been shown graphically. It is found that the effect of magnetic parameter is to decrease the velocity, temperature and induced magnetic fields while the effect of magnetic Prandtl number is to increase them.	chinese wall;semiconductor industry	Anand Kumar;Ashok K.

Three-dimensional bodies of arbitrary shape, with arbitrary couplings between translational and rotational degrees of freedom, as arise in coarse-grained models of polymers, are considered. Beginning from an Euler–Langevin form of the equations, two different, properly invariant, Hamilton–Langevin forms are derived and studied together with various associated measures. Under different conditions depending on the choice of rotational coordinates, the canonical measure is shown to be a stationary solution of an associated Fokker–Planck equation and to always factorize into independent measures on configuration and velocity spaces. Explicit expressions are given for these measures, along with a certain Jacobian factor associated with the three-dimensional rotation group. When specialized to a fully coupled, quadratic model of a stiff polymer such as DNA, our results yield an explicit characterization of the complete set of model parameters.	angularjs;approximation algorithm;authorization;chart;coefficient;crystal structure;displacement mapping;dynamic data;euler;euler–lagrange equation;ground state;interaction;jacobian matrix and determinant;level of detail;magma;markov chain;mass matrix;molecular dynamics;multiplicative noise;numerical analysis;polymer;quadratic equation;quantum fluctuation;simulation;stationary process;stationary state;stiff equation;stiffness matrix;velocity (software development);z-matrix (chemistry)	Jessika Walter;Oscar Gonzalez;John H Maddocks	2010	Multiscale Modeling & Simulation	10.1137/090765705	classical mechanics;molecular dynamics;rigid body;mathematical analysis;base pair;stochastic modelling;motion;mathematics;geometry;curvature;elasticity;physics;quantum mechanics	Graphics	86.95446289156492	3.646837818166629	21395

We demonstrate the spectrum broadening of both transmitted and reflected pulses due to the cascade mechanism of the high energy level excitation considering, for example, a three-energy level medium. The pulse spectrum in the range of high frequencies remains undisturbed in the presence of a disordered structure. To avoid false absorption frequencies detection, we apply the spectral dynamics analysis method (SDA-method) together with certain integral correlation criteria (ICC).	3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine;cascade device component;common criteria;common weakness enumeration;computer simulation;contain (action);distortion;emoticon;energy level;excitation;explosive agents;food processing industry;maxima and minima;maxwell (microarchitecture);naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;real life;semantics (computer science);signal reflection;strand displacement amplification;terahertz;anatomical layer;cyclonite;disease transmission;octogen;sensor (device);substance	Vyacheslav A.

Three different molecular weight chitosan powders were used to evaluate the topography of nanoscale features after molding process. The Young's modulus of three different molecular weight (120, 185 and 250 kDa) are almost the same in air with a value about 6 GPa and in medium with a value about 5 MPa. The size of the nanotexture is 250 nm in width and 200 nm in depth. Human breast cancer cells MCF-7 and HIG-82 fibroblasts were cultured on patterned nanotextured chitosan surfaces and both cells can be patterned on specific regions. The results exhibited the cells preferred to adhere on flat chitosan surfaces than on nanotextured chitosan surfaces. This nanotextured chitosan surfaces could be used for controlling cell development in bio-relevant applications, such biomedical devices, biology and tissue engineering.	british informatics olympiad;microfabrication;modulus robot;topography	Chung-Yao Yang;Chun-Yen Sung;J.

However, RDC experiments offer global orientation constraints for the H-N backbone vectors. Our first application validates local structure from 3 RDC values, by solving an elliptical equation. Second, we model the protein backbone by drawing upon robot kinematics, and compute the relative orientation of consecutive pairs of peptide planes; we obtain a unique orientation by considering also NOE distances. Third, we present a novel algebraic method for determining the relative orientation of secondary structures, a crucial question in fold classification. The orientation of the magnetic vector relative to the secondary structures is determined using two media, leading to a rotation matrix mapping one molecular frame to the other. A unique solution is obtained from RDC data, with no NOE constraints. Our algorithms use robust algebraic operations and are implemented in MAPLE.	protein structure prediction	Ioannis Z.

The modeling of diffusion, reaction and membrane transport of calcium ions in cells leads to a system of reaction-diffusion equations. We describe the modulation of cytosolic and ER calcium concentrations close to the membrane of the cell organelle. A conforming piecewise linear finite element method is used for the spatial discretization while linearly implicit methods, Rosenbrock type methods, are used for the time integration. We adopt a hybrid algorithm to solve the stochastic part. The space grid is adjusted to the strong localization of the calcium release following stochastic channel transitions. By automatically adapting the spatial meshes and time steps to the proper scales during the transition of channel states, the method accurately resolves the evolution of intracellular calcium concentrations as well as buffer concentrations. This article emphasizes the adaptive and efficient hybrid numerical simulations in two space dimensions. The presented work establishes the basis for future simulations in a realistic 3D geometry. nagaiah.chamakuri@uni-graz.at, Tel: +43316 3805063, Fax: +43316 3809815 sten.ruediger@gmail.com warnecke@ovgu.de falcke@hmi.de	central processing unit;closing (morphology);computer memory;computer simulation;deterministic algorithm;discretization;erdős–rényi model;fax;finite element method;german research centre for artificial intelligence;hybrid algorithm;modulation;numerical analysis;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations;numerical partial differential equations;numerical weather prediction;piecewise linear continuation;runge–kutta methods;self-propelled particles;stepping level;uniform resource identifier	Chamakuri Nagaiah;Sten Rüdiger;Gerald Warnecke;M.

They appear to align the body at a constant angle with the current flow line of the electric field while swimming towards prey. However, it has not been studied how they process the perception of electric fields for the approach behaviour or what kind of neural mechanism is used. We use a model of electrosensory perception with electrodynamics and explore a possible approach mechanism based on the sensory landscape distributed on electroreceptors. This paper presents that elasmobranchs can estimate the direction of the electric field by swaying their head, which will be a basis information for their particular approach behaviour. A velocity profile of voltage gradients and intensity difference among the ampullary clusters can be another cues to detect a prey source.	align (company);elasmobranchii;electroconvulsive therapy;gradient;prey;velocity (software development);electric field;voltage	Daeeun Kim	2007	Bio Systems	10.1016/j.biosystems.2006.09.029	biology;electric field;neural coding;ecology;anatomy;quantum mechanics	SE	89.61190866851085	-6.463200986331671	21613

Whether a process yields or costs heat is irrelevant. Condensation of water vapor yields work and hence is thermodynamically spontaneous only in a supersaturated atmosphere; in an unsaturated atmosphere it costs work and hence is thermodynamically nonspontaneous. Far more of Earth’s atmosphere is unsaturated than supersaturated; based on this alone evaporation is far more often work-yielding and hence thermodynamically spontaneous than condensation in Earth’s atmosphere—despite condensation always yielding heat and evaporation always costing heat. Furthermore, establishment of the unstable or at best metastable condition of supersaturation, and its maintenance in the face of condensation that would wipe it out, is always work-costing and hence thermodynamically nonspontaneous in Earth’s atmosphere or anywhere else. The work required to enable supersaturation is most usually provided at the expense of temperature differences that enable cooling to below the dew point. In the case of most interest to us, convective weather systems and storms, it is provided at the expense of vertical temperature gradients exceeding the moist adiabatic. Thus, ultimately, condensation is a work-costing and hence thermodynamically nonspontaneous process even in supersaturated regions of Earth’s or any other atmosphere. While heat engines in general can in principle extract all of the work represented by any temperature difference until it is totally neutralized to isothermality, convective weather systems and storms in particular cannot. They can extract only the work represented by partial neutralization of super-moist-adiabatic lapse rates to moist-adiabaticity. Super-moist-adiabatic lapse rates are required to enable convection of saturated air. Condensation cannot occur fast enough to maintain relative humidity in a cloud exactly at saturation, thereby trapping some water vapor in metastable supersaturation. Only then can the water vapor condense. Thus ultimately condensation is a thermodynamically nonspontaneous process forced by super-moist-adiabatic lapse rates. Yet water vapor plays vital roles in atmospheric thermodynamics and kinetics. Convective weather systems and storms in a dry atmosphere (e.g., dust devils) can extract only the work represented by partial neutralization of super-dry-adiabatic lapse rates to dry-adiabaticity. At typical atmospheric temperatures in the tropics, where convective weather systems and storms are most frequent and active, the moist-adiabatic lapse rate is much smaller (thus much closer to isothermality), and hence represents much more extractable work, than the dry—the thermodynamic advantage of water vapor. Moreover, the large heat of condensation (and to a lesser extent fusion) of water facilitates much faster heat transfer from Earth’s surface to the tropopause than is possible in a dry atmosphere, thereby facilitating much faster extraction of work, i.e., much greater power, than is possible in a dry atmosphere—the kinetic advantage of water vapor.	computer cooling;control theory;evaporation;gradient;kinetics internet protocol;mike lesser;relevance;spontaneous order	Jack Denur	2016	Entropy	10.3390/e18120417	meteorology;entropy;energy;second law of thermodynamics;power;evaporation;convection;work;thermodynamics;physics;kinetics;quantum mechanics;condensation		98.22833552792491	-5.851710689351285	21710

Two different substrates were used: rigid FR-4 board and flexible liquid crystal polymer (LCP) board. The reliability of the test samples was studied in a temperature cycling test, carried out between temperatures of -40 °C and 125 °C. To determine the exact time of a failure the resistance of each test sample was measured using continuous real-time measurement.

C-V analysis indicated the fact that the depletion layer was generated in the P3HT film in the reversed bias condition. The flat band voltage analysis suggested that the interfacial charge affected the built-in potential of the diodes. Al/P3HT heterojunction is possible to be used as not only the rectification diodes but also gate junctions for junction type field effect or static induction transistors.	diode;heterojunction	Fumihiko Hirose;Yasuo Kimura;Michio Niwano	2009	IEICE Transactions		electronic engineering;schottky diode;heterojunction;engineering;optoelectronics;flexible electronics;physics	DB	91.41566895095472	-11.746778155606883	21815
d81de7f6a2f42da596ae456fbc42c3eb73f21b71	estimating lipophilicity using the gb/sa continuum solvation model: a direct method for computing partition coefficients	partition coefficient;direct method	"""published in Advance ACS Absrmcrs, June 1. 1995. 0095-2338/95/1635-0738$09.00/0 the same molecule. The most significant problems with BLOGP are that it is built on an empirical expression which contains many highly correlated terms and that it includes some terms for which no clear mechanistic justification exists. These factors call the statistical significance of the BLOGP model into question. Recently CoMFA has also been used to derive lipophilicities directly from solute steric and electronic fields."""" For all their differences, these methods share the problems inherent in empirically derived models and may have limited validity outside their compound training sets. The most theoretically satisfying method for computing partition constants would be direct simulation of a solute in water and organic Once the free energy of solvation in aqueous and organic media have been determined, it is a simple matter to compute log P. This approach has been demonstrated with some success using molecular dynamics (MD)I4 and Monte Carlo (MC)I5-l7 methods. The advantages of all atom simulations are their generality and theoretical rigor. The disadvantage of using all atom MD or MC simulations to compute log P is that both are computationally very demanding and, therefore, impractical for computing the number of partition coefficients needed for a typical QSAR study. Another direct approach is to compute the free energy change for transfemng a solute from aqueous to organic solution using a continuum solvation model, such as the molecular mechanics based GB/SA model'* or the quantum mechanical SM2 m0de1.I~ These methods are simpler and much more efficient than MD and MC simulations using explicit solvent and show promise for giving reasonable estimates of solution free The GB/SA method has also been parameterized to model one organic solvent, chloroform. This means that one can calculate the free energy associated with taking a compound from the gas phase to either water or chloroform. Using a simple thermochemical cycle this provides the free energy change from chloroform to water. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that chlorofondwater log P coefficients (log PCR) can be reliably estimated by computing this free energy change using the GB/SA solvation model."""	apache continuum;atom;coefficient;direct method in the calculus of variations;implicit solvation;molecular dynamics;molecular mechanics;monte carlo method;quantitative structure–activity relationship;quantum mechanics;simulation;triune continuum paradigm;water model	Charles H.

This model studies the shell pattern pigmentation of molluscs. Moreover, PASHEMOS enables theoretical analysis to be performed on the different steady states. The program takes into account the four differential equation systems established in the model. It numerically solves these systems. This program is developed in such a way that both the equation system type and the parameter values can be chosen. The pattern is displayed in each case, and other output possibilities are available (i.e. three-dimensional concentration plotting, phase plane, phase space, stability analysis). The implementation of the program for the case of a three-variable system is shown as an example of PASHEMOS handling. Program applications for other models are also discussed.		R. Hernandez;J. A.

In order to investigate the development of diameter error, the turning operation is simulated by using the Rayleigh beam theory. Through this theory, the dynamic response of a rotating workpiece under the cutting force is determined. Then, the diameter error of slender bar is determined based on the geometric correlation between the workpiece deflection and the diameter error. In this simulation, the cutting force is obtained using an empirical model, which is extensively used. Finally, a series of experimental tests are carried out to validate the simulation of diameter error. The experimental results demonstrate that the simulated values are considerably accurate. In addition, in order to eliminate the diameter error through error compensation method, the nominal depth of cut corresponding to a certain actual depth is determined by using the proposed model. The originality of this work is that the rotational motion of workpiece is taken into account in determining the diameter error of slender bar.

cad6ecdc8f7dd481487329a1afa81597c0968011	a 2.75 d finite element model of 3d fracture network systems	finite element model	The simulation of uid ow and heat transport in fracture network systems requires new grid generation techniques. A fractured subsurface domain may be regarded as a convex 3 d domain split up into convex subdomains. When it comes to hexahedrally meshing it there is still no method which provides overall simplicity, uniqueness, and robustness, and furthermore good mesh quality near those fracture planes as they govern the phenomena. For these cases we propose 2.75 d meshes. The basic idea is that the regions with steady state conditions need not be considered and, consequently they need not be meshed at all. Those regions are located far from the fractures. Accordingly, the 2.75 d mesh is a skeleton of 3 d elements covering the fracture planes in the domain. These can thus be analytically computed as layered hexahedral elements. Pre-requisites are a topological analysis of the domain and expertise in uid dynamics in order to properly decide about the space to be omitted.	algorithm;finite element method;hexahedron;image-based meshing;mesh generation;simulation;steady state;thickness (graph theory);user interface design	Sylvia Moenickes;Takeo Taniguchi;Rene Kaiser;Werner Zielke	2002			superelement;mechanics;smoothed finite element method;materials science;mixed finite element method;magnetohydrodynamic generator;finite element method;separator (oil production);finite element limit analysis;extended finite element method	Visualization	85.47050664464452	-12.375587395629758	22011

6a7413ef9b82ae67a7ed5dbec736114bf45e3ddd	deicing of aluminum alloy rod by laser induced bubble explosion reaction		Icing is a major security risk for transmission line of power systems in the cold winter. Traditional deicing methods such as mechanical deicing and thermos-fuse methods are characterized by high energy cost, time consuming and inevitable obvious damage to the external surface of transmission line. A novel method of laser induced bubble explosion reaction (LIBER) to remove ice accretion on transmission line is promoted in this work. The effects of laser power, scanning speed, thickness of foaming layer and ice layer on laser deicing were studied and the results showed that the removal of ice accretion could be achieved with scanning speed of 10 ∼ 20mm/s and laser power ranging from 1000 to 2000W. Ice accretions with the thickness from 3 to 7mm were successfully removed with no damage or negligible damage to the substrate surface, which validated the feasibility of this new LIBER-based deicing method that would have significant applications to the actual deicing scenarios of power grid.	blast;dot-com bubble;ibm power systems;thickness (graph theory);transmission line	Wenjun Xu;Jian Zhang;Yifeng Chen;Wei Xue;Yu Cao	2017	2017 4th International Conference on Systems and Informatics (ICSAI)	10.1109/ICSAI.2017.8248323	computer science;bubble;laser power scaling;control theory;transmission line;electric power transmission;accretion (meteorology);aluminium;icing;laser;composite material	EDA	87.52468414581864	-12.694132898039484	22057

The structures of 13 molecules have been well fit using the MM4 force field. Moments of inertia have been fit with rms percentage errors as indicated: 18 moments for ethers, 0.28%; 21 moments for alcohols, 0.22%. Rotational barriers and conformational equilibria have also been examined, and the experimental and ab initio results are reproduced substantially better with MM4 than they were with MM3. Much of the improvement comes from the use of additional interaction terms in the force constant matrix, of which the torsion-bend and torsion-torsion are particularly important. Induced dipoles are included in the calculation, and dipole moments are reasonably well fit. It has been possible for the first time to fit conformational energetic data for both open chain and cyclic alcohols (e.g., propanol and cyclohexanol) with the same parameter set. For vibrational spectra, over a total of 82 frequencies, the rms error is 27 cm(-1), as opposed to 38 cm(-1) with MM3. Both the alpha and beta bond shortening resulting from the presence of the electronegative oxygen atom in the molecule are well reproduced. The electronegativity of the oxygen is sufficient that one must also include not only the alpha and beta electronegativity effects on bond lengths, but also on angle distortions, if structures are to be well reproduced. The heats of formation of 32 alcohols and ethers were fit overall to within experimental error (weighted standard deviation error 0.26 kcal/mol).		Norman L.

The SN2 transition states of the methylation reactions at N7, N3, and O6 of guanine; N7, N3, and N1 of adenine; N3 and O2 of cytosine; and O2 and O4 of thymine were calculated using the B3LYP density functional method. Solvation effects were examined using the conductor-like polarizable continuum method and the combined discrete/SCRF method. The transition states for reactions at guanine N3, adenine N7, and adenine N1 are influenced by steric interactions between the methane diazonium ion and exocyclic amino groups. Both in the gas phase and in aqueous solution, the methylation reactions at N atoms have transition states that are looser, and generally occur earlier along the reaction pathways than reactions at O atoms. The forming bonds in the transition states in water are 0.03 to 0.13 A shorter than those observed in the gas phase, and the activation energies are 13 to 35 kcal/mol higher. The combined discrete/SCRF solvation energy calculations using base-water complexes with three water molecules yield base solvation energies that are larger than those obtained from the CPCM continuum method, especially for cytosine. Reactivities calculated using barriers obtained with the discrete/SCRF method are consistent with the experimentally observed high reactivity at N7 of guanine.		Kaushalya S. Ekanayake;Pierre R.

Three red-orange poly(3-TPAA) films, named electrodes A, B and C, were electropolymerized on a platinum electrode by applying a constant current of 1.5 mA, for 5, 20 and 100 s, respectively. Further, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamiopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC · HCl) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) were used to activate the free carboxylic groups of the conducting polymer. Afterwards, the amino groups of the cholesterol oxidase were linked on the activated groups to form peptide bonds. The best sensitivity obtained for electrode B is 4.49 mA M(-1) cm(-2), with a linear concentration ranging from 0 to 8 mM, which is suitable for the analysis of cholesterol in humans. The response time (t(95)) is between 70 and 90 s and the limit of detection is 0.42 mM, based on the signal to noise ratio equal to 3. The interference of species such as ascorbic acid and uric acid increased to 5.2 and 10.3% of the original current response, respectively, based on the current response of cholesterol (100%). With respect to the long-term stability, the sensing response retains 88% of the original current after 13 days.	activation action;ascorbic acid;behavior;cholesterol oxidase;constant current;covalent interaction;error detection and correction;hydrochloric acid;immobiliser;interference (communication);mac os x 10.3 panther;name;national supercomputer centre in sweden;platinum;polymer;reagents;response time (technology);selectivity (electronic);sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;spectroscopy, fourier transform infrared;thioctic acid;uric acid;dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate);electrode;ethylene dichloride	Po-Chin Nien;Po-Yen Chen;Kuo-Chuan Ho	2009		10.3390/s90301794	biochemistry;chemistry;bioinformatics;organic chemistry;nanotechnology;covalent bond	Mobile	95.72889784898234	-17.09673331876017	22240

The results obtained in the tests vary according to the percentage of the fibers, the water content, the size of grains (grains size distribution) and percentage of composite fibers. Therefore, it is important to estimate the deformation of concrete corresponding to the applied load according to available data and in the case of lacking of enough experimental data. For this purpose, neural network technique was used to predict the load–displacement curve and also compressive strength of concrete based on mix proportions. At first, the results of experimental tests carried out in PWUT laboratory on fiber reinforced concrete specimens are presented and then the missing experimental data and gaps in load–displacement curve trend are predicted by back-propagation method in neural network. It is worth mentioning that it can also be used to study the different types of fibers and also orientation of the fibers which will be presented in future works. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

4e39d09bb978e5b8bdf3ef3f259811f147ee90a4	visual simulation of glazed frost	robotics;human robot interaction;animation	Glazed frost is a crystal clear ice and formed from supercooled raindrops that freeze when they hit object surfaces such as the ground and branches of trees. Simulation methods for formation of ice crystal, such as frost, on the surface of objects have been proposed by Kim et al. [Kim et al. 2004]. However, a supercooling state has to be considered for simulating freezing rain, and fluid simulation is required for reproducing the effect of raindrops running down on the ice surfaces. To our best knowledge, there has been no research presenting glazed frost by using a fluid simulation. We use the fluid simulation based on FLIP method [Zhu and Bridson 2005]. Hence, raindrops and obstacles are represented by particles which are used to calculate the advection term, and the update of velocity field are calculated by using grids except for advection term. We propose a method to create an animation of glazed frost formation by taking into account the heat transfer between particles and the outside grids.	augmented reality;fluid animation;liquid-crystal display;simulation;velocity (software development)	Tomokazu Ishikawa;Yoshinori Dobashi;Yonghao Yue;Masanori Kakimoto;Taichi Watanabe;Kunio Kondo;Kei Iwasaki;Tomoyuki Nishita	2013		10.1145/2503385.2503400	anime;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;robotics	Graphics	89.37760105491668	-4.680464316929634	22329

By using a micro temperature sensor fabricated on a stainless steel-based micro reformer, this work attempts to measure the inner temperature and increase the conversion efficiency. Micro temperature sensors on a stainless steel substrate are fabricated using micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) and then placed separately inside the micro reformer. Micro temperature sensors are characterized by their higher accuracy and sensitivity than those of a conventional thermocouple. To the best of our knowledge, micro temperature sensors have not been embedded before in micro reformers and commercial products, therefore, this work presents a novel approach to integrating micro temperature sensors in a stainless steel-based micro reformer in order to evaluate inner local temperature distributions and enhance reformer performance.	embedded system;embedding;micro-electrical-mechanical systems;microelectromechanical systems;stainless steel;temperature sensor device component;thermocouple device component;sensor (device)	Chi-Yuan Lee;Chien-Hen Lin;Yi-Man Lo	2011		10.3390/s110403706	electronic engineering;carbon monoxide;hydrogen;chemistry;temperature;organic chemistry;nanotechnology;microelectromechanical systems;forensic engineering;physics;quantum mechanics	Mobile	92.38518277015434	-17.063033951915717	22438

2d9483245b1305ec602a009533bbf78d17f339ab	measurement of purity, the simplest nonlinear functional of the density matrix		After reviewing the earlier ideas to measure the purity of a quantum system, a new scheme for the measurement of purity is presented, which aims at providing a simple, direct and efficient procedure without resorting to quantum state tomography. The scheme is also illustrated in the Bloch-vector representation for a two-level quantum system (qubit) and for a general D-level quantum system. As a variant, a simple example implemented in a one-dimensional scattering process to measure the purity of the target qubit is also given.	density matrix;purity (quantum mechanics)	Tohru Tanaka;Hiromichi Nakazato	2014	Open Syst.

Homogeneous (i.e. identical for all subsystems) local manipulation implies a more refined classification of interaction Hamiltonians than the inhomogeneous case, as well as the loss of universality in Hamiltonian simulation. For the case of symmetric two–qubit interactions, we provide time–optimal protocols for both Hamiltonian simulation and gate synthesis.	and gate;computer;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);interaction;quantum computing;qubit;simulation;solid-state drive;universal turing machine	Lluis Masanes;Guifré Vidal;José Ignacio Latorre	2002	Quantum Information & Computation		statistical physics;quantum;pure mathematics;controlled not gate;mathematics;quantum computer;physics;quantum mechanics;covariant hamiltonian field theory	Logic	92.26208872551146	0.9007676515698597	22828
7243281933c0c44c7ce7e32b0beed805bca234de	a noncovalent binding strategy to capture noble gases, hydrogen and nitrogen	dft calculations;aromatic receptors;cage effect;noncovalent binding	"""A molecular design strategy to develop receptor systems for the entrapment of noble gases, H2 and N2 is described using M06L-D3/6-311++G(d,p)//M06L/6-311++G(d,p) DFT method. These receptors made with two-, three-, four- and five-fluorinated benzene cores, linked with methelene units viz. RI , RII , RIII and RIV as well as the corresponding non-fluorinated hydrocarbons viz. RIH , RIIH , RIIIH and RIVH show a steady and significant increase in binding energy (Eint ) with increase in the number of aromatic rings in the receptor. A stabilizing """"cage effect"""" is observed in the cyclophane type receptors RIV and RIVH which is 26-48% of total Eint for all except the larger sized Kr, Xe and N2 complexes. Eint of RIV …He, RIV …Ne, RIV …Ar, RIV …Kr, RIV …H2 and RIV …N2 is 4.89, 7.03, 6.49, 6.19, 8.57 and 8.17 kcal/mol, respectively which is 5- to9-fold higher than that of hexafluorobenzene. Similarly, compared to benzene, multiple fold increase in Eint is observed for RIVH receptors with noble gases, H2 and N2 . Fluorination of the aromatic core has no significant impact on Eint (∼ ±0.5 kcal/mol) for most of the systems with a notable exception of the cage receptor RIV for N2 where fluorination improves Eint by 1.61 kcal/mol. The Eint of the cage receptors may be projected as one of the highest interaction energy ranges reported for noble gases, H2 and N2 for a neutral carbon framework. Synthesis of such systems is promising in the study of molecules in confined environment. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."""		Cherumuttathu H.

175a2583bf20d2d231ac28baf546d8cf660dd15b	extending the generalized reed model with measured reflection functions		In previous work, the authors presented a generalized parametric model of a pressure controlled valve, allowing the user to design a continuum of reed configurations, including “blown open”, “blown closed” and the “swinging door”. Though the generalized reed model behaved as expected, the quality of the produced sound was somewhat limited, likely due to the dependence of reed oscillation on the connected instrument bore and bell. In this work we further explore the sound production of the generalized reed by incorporating reflection filters measured from actual musical instruments. The measurement technique is shown to produce results closely matching theoretical expectation for cylindrical and conical tu bes, and is applied to the clarinet and trumpet. Measurements are incorporated into a waveguide model using the generalized reed.	apache continuum;parametric model	Tamara Smyth;Jonathan S.

31498857ead6a268c6739bab667f9bfa79f2fafd	sensing performance analysis on quartz tuning fork-probe at the high order vibration mode for multi-frequency scanning probe microscopy	dynamic mechanical behavior;finite element method;high mode;multi-frequency scanning near-field optical microscopy;quartz tuning fork-probe	Multi-frequency scanning near-field optical microscopy, based on a quartz tuning fork-probe (QTF-p) sensor using the first two orders of in-plane bending symmetrical vibration modes, has recently been developed. This method can simultaneously achieve positional feedback (based on the 1st in-plane mode called the low mode) and detect near-field optically induced forces (based on the 2nd in-plane mode called the high mode). Particularly, the high mode sensing performance of the QTF-p is an important issue for characterizing the tip-sample interactions and achieving higher resolution microscopic imaging but the related researches are insufficient. Here, we investigate the vibration performance of QTF-p at high mode based on the experiment and finite element method. The frequency spectrum characteristics are obtained by our homemade laser Doppler vibrometer system. The effects of the properties of the connecting glue layer and the probe features on the dynamic response of the QTF-p sensor at the high mode are investigated for optimization design. Finally, compared with the low mode, an obvious improvement of quality factor, of almost 50%, is obtained at the high mode. Meanwhile, the QTF-p sensor has a high force sensing sensitivity and a large sensing range at the high mode, indicating a broad application prospect for force sensing.	airplane mode;bending - changing basic body position;crystal oscillator;finite element method;interaction;mathematical optimization;microscopy;microscopy, atomic force;normal mode;profiling (computer programming);quartz;relative biological effectiveness;spectral density;orders - hl7publishingdomain	Xiaofei Zhang;Fengli Gao;Xide Li	2018		10.3390/s18020336	electronic engineering;bending;analytical chemistry;engineering;finite element method;scanning probe microscopy;laser doppler vibrometer;normal mode;optical microscope;vibration;tuning fork	Robotics	92.0697787898739	-15.999718799118149	23126

The yellow light procedure is performed to define a V-groove width for disposing an optical fiber on a silicon substrate. After dry etching a vertical groove, a dielectric layer is grown on the surface of the silicon substrate to protect the vertical wall, preventing the groove from getting wider due to subsequent wet etching. A 45-degree mirror surface is formed so that an optoelectronic device can be disposed on the mirror surface in the flip chip method. The optoelectronic module employs a complete silicon substrate to assemble a surface-emitting optoelectronic devices and an optical fiber by passive alignment, and therefore can be free from misalignment due to separate assembly.	relational database	Perihan Kilimci;Oya Kalipsiz;Adem Korkmaz	2009			optical fiber;optoelectronics;dielectric;database;relational database;dry etching;flip chip;etching (microfabrication);materials science;groove (music);silicon	DB	86.29793282183033	-19.394831092457576	23153

The goal is to detect the presence of radiation on a composite structure as rapidly as possible and to identify its location, much the same way human skin senses heat. A secondary goal is to determine how a network of sensors can be optimized to detect thermal damage in laser-irradiated composite materials or structures. Initial tests are conducted on polymer matrix composites reinforced with either carbon or glass fiber with a single optical fiber embedded into each specimen. As many as three sensors in each optical fiber measure the temporal and spatial thermal response of the composite to high energy radiation incident on the surface. Additional tests use a 2 × 2 × 3 array of 12 sensors embedded in a carbon fiber/epoxy composite to simultaneously measure temperature variations at locations on the composite surface and through the thickness. Results indicate that FBGs can be used to rapidly detect temperature gradients in a composite and their location, even for a direct strike of laser radiation on a sensor, when high temperatures can cause a non-uniform thermal response and FBG decay.	algorithm;biological specimen;cdisc send biospecimens terminology;convection;data acquisition;differential thermal analysis;embedded system;embedding;energy level;epoxy resins;esthesia;experiment;eye;fever;fiber optic sensor;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;gradient;image sensor;instrument - device;matrix analysis;optical fiber;polymer;rayleigh–ritz method;reflectometry;refresh rate;signal processing;small;stellar classification;thermal conductivity;thickness (graph theory);wavelength-division multiplexing;anatomical layer;fiberglass;sensor (device);wavelength	R.

Recently, some alternate Petlyuk-like schemes that might provide better operational properties than the Petlyuk column have been proposed.

However, the computational effort to obtain the analytical values for such sensitivities is a formidable task. Hence, it has generally been avoided when bending systems are considered; instead, approaches based on finite differences have been used. Nevertheless, using the latter method to carry out sensitivity analyses leads to considerable error, especially with shape variables, as many authors have pointed out. In this paper, the analytical expressions of sensitivity analyses with respect to shape variables are carried out for bending systems in second order theory. The first step is to evaluate the sensitivity analyses of the nodal movements by performing the loading vector along with the elastic and geometric stiffness matrix sensitivity analyses. Then, the sensitivity analyses of the maximum normal stresses are evaluated. Thereafter, there is an explanation of structural examples in which the previous analytical sensitivities are evaluated. The results are contrasted with those obtained by finite difference methods. There is also an example where the analytical sensitivities are used to carry out the optimisation of a portal structure. Finally, conclusions drawn from this work are presented. q 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	finite difference method;mathematical optimization;stiffness matrix	Juan C.

Non-linear FEM computations, taking into account of experimental  σ ( e ) measured curves, show that Laser welding process can induce high level of strains in columns of the Laser platform, bearing the Laser diode, responsible of an optical axis shift and a gradual drop of the optical power in relation with relaxation of accumulated stresses in the sub-assembly. In the case of thermal cycles, stresses can occur on elements sensitive to coefficient of thermal expansion mismatches such as solder joint between the Laser platform and thermoelectric cooler and as fiber glued into the pigtail leading to crack propagation with sudden drop of optical power. The main objective of the paper is to evaluate thermomechanical sensitivity and critical zones of the Laser module in order to improve mechanical stability after Laser weld and reach qualification standards requirements without failures. Experimental analyses were also conducted to correlate simulation results and monitor the output optical power of Laser modules after 500 thermal cycles (−40 °C/+85 °C VRT).	finite element method;simulation	Yannick Deshayes;Laurent Béchou;Jean-Yves Delétage;Frédéric Verdier;Yves Danto;Dominique Laffitte;Jean-Luc Goudard	2003	Microelectronics Reliability	10.1016/S0026-2714(03)00099-4	fracture mechanics;structural engineering;thermal expansion;three-dimensional space;temperature cycling;engineering;finite element method;mathematics;laser beam welding;physics	Robotics	88.42363533094947	-13.588873268718176	23560

Accordingly, the present work reports the analysis of different simulations of bovine rhodopsin embedded in a dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) lipid bilayer using two different sampling conditions and two different approaches for the treatment of long-range electrostatic interactions. Specifically, sampling was carried out either by using the statistical ensembles NVT or NPT (constant number of atoms, a pressure of 1 atm in all directions and fixed temperature), and the electrostatic interactions were treated either by using a twin-cutoff, or the particle mesh Ewald summation method (PME). The results of the present study suggest that the use of the NPT ensemble in combination with the PME method provide more realistic simulations. The use of NPT during the equilibration avoids the need of an a priori estimation of the box dimensions, giving the correct area per lipid. However, once the system is equilibrated, the simulations are irrespective of the sampling conditions used. The use of an electrostatic cutoff induces artifacts on both lipid thickness and the ion distribution, but has no direct effect on the protein and water molecules.		Arnau Cordomí;Olle Edholm;Juan J.

38d65ea3357aaeffe10e56ac67f162096ce951dc	gyrokinetic particle-in-cell calculations of ion temperature gradient driven turbulence with parallel nonlinearity and strong flow corrections	shear flow;ucla;three dimensional;self consistent;ion temperature gradient;ion temperature gradient driven;heat flux;particle in cell;aspect ratio	Nonlinear gyrokinetic calculations have been performed with the three-dimensional, global, toroidal, particle-in-cell, delta-f, UCAN code1 to study the effects of parallel nonlinearity and strong (externally imposed) flow corrections on ion temperature gradient driven turbulence. These calculations are electrostatic and adiabatic electrons are used. An equilibrium ion temperature gradient only is imposed, along with a generic parabolic q-profile appropriate to a large aspect ratio tokamak. The strong flow corrections derived by T. S. Hahm2 have been added to the usual orbit and weight equations used in the UCAN code. The parallel nonlinearity3 has been reactivated as well in the same equations. To examine the effect of strong flow corrections, the calculations have been performed with fluctuations-generated flows or zonal flows arbitrarily set to zero but with externally imposed sheared flows obeying a variety of profiles more or less localized in radius and with various flow magnitudes. The calculations show that the strong flow corrections have a qualitative effect on the saturation level of the fluctuations and on the steadystate heat flux even at the highest flow magnitudes used. The re-activated parallel nonlinearity, with no externally imposed flow but with fluctuations-generated or zonal flows allowed to selfconsistently evolve in the calculations, does however make a significant quantitative difference in the saturation level of the fluctuations and in the saturated flux. The presence of the parallel nonlinearity leads to a reduction in both, in apparent agreement with the results of Villard and colleagues3.

This article concerns a review of the development of the modern theory for transforming the diffraction data into structural information. Several points are emphasized, namely, the value of introducing mathematical and physical constraints into the analysis, the adjustments that often need to be made in order to apply ideal mathematics to non-ideal experimental data, and how simple concepts that may arise in one technique can be applied with revolutionary effects in a related technique. In the cases considered here the concept of particular interest is nonnegativity. The more complex crystal structures still offer a challenge to the analytical methods. It is pointed out that someof the mathematics that is now decades old continues to offer opportunities, especially with the great progress in computational facilities, to make future advances with structural problems that constitute the present day challenges.	crystal structure;electron diffraction	Jerome Karle	1994	Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Sciences	10.1021/ci00018a025	stereochemistry;chemistry;molecule;mathematical chemistry;crystal structure;calculus;mineralogy;x-ray crystallography;quantum mechanics	PL	93.18063030170912	-5.383785439794342	24096

The complexes 2-18 are thermodynamically stable and may be synthesized. The small molecules are activated to some extent after complexation. Molecular orbital and ΔG calculation revealed that the molecular hydrogen and hydrocarbons can be chemically adsorbed and desorbed on [Fe(CB(6))] without any significant chemical modification and therefore [Fe(CB(6))] may serve as a storage material. The N(2), O(2), and nitric oxide (NO(-), NO, and NO(+)) can be activated using [Fe(CB(6))]. Proton, carbon, boron, and nitrogen NMR chemical shift calculation predicts drastic chemical shift difference before and after the complexation of [Fe(CB(6))] with small molecules. This new findings suggest that the CB(6)(2-) ligand-based complex may provide several applications in the future.

The structures of the surface MEMS having thin shape with small aspect ratio are difficult to drive to the lateral direction. The conventional electrostatic actuators have comb electrodes, resulting in a complex structure. This research addresses on the actuators available to move in a lateral direction by using thin-film Pb(Zr, Ti)O3. Test cantilevers with two segmented top electrodes on the piezoelectric film are fabricated and the driving characteristics are evaluated. Applications of electrical voltages with reversed phases to the segmented top electrodes at the resonant frequency with lateral oscillation mode moved the cantilever with large displacement of 7 mm. A non-linear effect in the frequency response was also observed for the large applied voltages.	comb filter;crystal oscillator;displacement mapping;frequency response;lateral computing;lateral thinking;microelectromechanical systems;nonlinear system;normal mode;physical vapor deposition;piezoelectricity;resonance	Kensuke Kanda;Yu Akashi;Takashi Saito;Takayuki Fujita;Kohei Higuchi;Kazusuke Maenaka	2012	2012 Fifth International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology	10.1109/ICETET.2012.11	materials science;control engineering;ceramic materials;electronic engineering	Robotics	89.06162833049463	-17.274720237108582	24143

A polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mold was selected as the UV imprinting mold. The pillar pattern was formed on a 50 × 50 mm area on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film without remarkable deformation. The aspect ratios of the pillar and space were about four and ten, respectively. The mold was placed into contact with a UV-curable resin under a reduced pressure, and the resin was cured by UV light irradiation after exposure to atmospheric pressure. The PDMS mold showed good mold releasability and high flexibility. By moderately pressing the mold before UV-curing, the thickness of the residual layer of the imprinted resin was reduced and the pattern was precisely imprinted. Both batch pressing and roll pressing are available.	3d film;pdms;polyethylene terephthalate;polymer;resin;thickness (graph theory)	Hidetoshi Shinohara;Hiroshi Goto;Takashi Kasahara;Jun Mizuno	2013	Micromachines	10.3390/mi4020157	aspect ratio;materials science;composite material;polymer chemistry	Robotics	92.96871224267737	-14.357348265489476	24368

Velocity fluctuations are modeled by a Gaussian random field. The interface evolution is determined by a Langevin-type equation with a multiplicative random field, which in the case of the quasi-homogeneous random Gaussian field is equivalent to Fokker–Planck dynamics. We analyze numerically the Fokker–Planck equation and compare growth kinetics in the case of noisy (i.e. space-independent) fluctuations. It is shown that for a large class of spatially correlated velocity fluctuations, the growth kinetics is universal, i.e. it does not depend on the details of statistics of fluctuations.	kinesiology;velocity	M.

It offers several advantages like decreased energy input, reduced scale formation, better surface quality and closer tolerances. Warm forming is common for rotation symmetric parts but has not been applied for long flat pieces yet. The main obstacles prohibiting the transfer are the missing of a suitable preforming technology and the problems to keep the narrow temperature tolerances despite the increased number of forming operations compared to rotation-symmetric process routes. In a cooperative effort within a European consortium of forges and scientific institutes, closed-die warm forging processes for long flat pieces have been developed. To cover a wide range of longitudinal geometries, two model products, a connecting rod and a steering link, with unequal requirements towards the production process have been selected. The process developed for the steering link is discussed in this article.	graphite;normal (geometry);requirement	Bernd-Arno Behrens;P. Suchmann;A.

In a normal valve, supply pressure is decompressed with an orifice structure. When compressed air passes through the orifice structure, considerable noise occurs at the downstream side. In this paper, we have developed a radial slit structure that can reduce pressure without noise. The noise is reduced by changing the orifice structure into the radial slit structure. The radial slit structure valve reduces pressure without noise by suppressing the generation of turbulence and shock wave at the downstream. The analysis of the flow in radial slit structure was achieved by CFD2000 software. The flow rate and pressure distribution were simulated and compared with the experimental result. To confirm the generation of shock wave, the flow of orifice and radial slit structure at the downstream was visualized by Schlieren photography method. A shock wave was generated in the orifice structure, but no shock wave was generated in the radial slit structure. Noise reduction efficiency was investigated by the experiment. The experiment apparatus was set up to JIS standards. The experimental results indicated that the noise level decreased by approximately 40 dB in the slit structure. It is confirmed that the radial slit structure has effectiveness for low noise in the pressure reducing flow. And, it is expected that it can be applied to various kinds of industrial fields.	downstream (software development);noise (electronics);noise reduction;radial (radio);shift jis;turbulence	Chongho Youn;Seiichiro Asano;Kenji Kawashima;Toshiharu Kagawa	2008	J.

To measure a clear and reliable sEMG signal, stable skin contact is required. If the electrode is moved with respect to the skin, the charge distribution at the interface will be changed, causing a noise known as a motion artifact. In this study, a skin grasping sEMG interface is proposed to guarantee stable electrode-skin contact. A bent interface grasps and presses a limb. The MNA electrodes integrated in both ends of the interface allow stable skin contact. Both a skin contact condition investigation and a classification of hand motions are demonstrated to assess practicality.	artifact (error);electromyography;modified nodal analysis	Minjae Kim;Gangyong Gu;Wan Kyun Chung	2017	2017 14th International Conference on Ubiquitous Robots and Ambient Intelligence (URAI)	10.1109/URAI.2017.7992839	electronic engineering;electromyography;electrode;engineering drawing;engineering	Robotics	89.11476360260185	-21.20944705613291	24653

In order to analyze the working principle of this sensor, the elastic property of fiber-optic delay was theoretically researched and the elastic coefficient was measured as 3.78 ps/km·με. In this sensor, an extra reference path was introduced to simplify the measurement of delay and resist the cross-effect of environmental temperature. Utilizing an optical fiber stretcher driven by piezoelectric ceramics, the performance of this strain sensor was tested. The experimental results demonstrate that temperature fluctuations contribute little to the strain error and that the calculated strain sensitivity is as high as 4.75 με in the range of 350 με. As a result, this strain sensor is proved to be feasible and practical, which is appropriate for strain measurement in a simple and economical way. Furthermore, on basis of this sensor, the quasi-distributed measurement could be also easily realized by wavelength division multiplexing and wavelength addressing for long-distance structure health and security monitoring.	ceramics;coefficient;discriminator;environmental temperature;experiment;eye;optical fiber;optics;patient holding stretchers;piezoelectricity;prototype;sensor;tissue fiber;wavelength-division multiplexing;voltage;wavelength	Ning Yang;Jun Su;Zhiqiang Fan;Qi Qiu	2017		10.3390/s17051005	electronic engineering;optics	Mobile	91.65224201296884	-20.338238065505866	24740

Wind tunnel experiments performed at the National Aerospace Laboratory (NAL) in Japan have shown that the self-sustained oscillations arise in a subcritical Hopf bifurcation. However, analysis of the experimental data also reveals that this bifurcation is modified in various ways. We present an outline of the construction of a 6 DOF model of the aeroelastic behavior of the wing structure. When this model is extended by the introduction of nonlinear terms, it can reproduce the subcritical Hopf bifurcation. We hereafter consider the effects of subjecting simplified versions of the model to random external excitations representing the fluctuations present in the airflow. These models can reproduce several of the experimentally observed modifications of the flutter transition. In particular, the models display the characteristic phenomena of coherence resonance.	randomness;wow and flutter measurement	Lasse Engbo Christiansen;Tue Lehn-Schiøler;Erik Mosekilde;Peter Gránásy;Hiroshi Matsushita	2002	Mathematics and Computers in Simulation	10.1016/S0378-4754(01)00379-2	classical mechanics;wind tunnel;control theory;physics	ECom	85.21115313703363	-1.7724224036535892	24883

It is found that the worst case hot carrier stress condition in asymmetric nDeMOS transistors is at Ig,max, and not at Ib,max and hot-electron injection (HE, i.e. Vgs = Vds). Further, the damage regions in transistors upon various hot carrier stress modes are located by using variable amplitude charge pumping technique. It is found that the interface traps generation in the gate/n-type graded drain (NGRD) overlap and spacer/NGRD regions is the dominant mechanism of hot carrier degradation in transistors upon Ig,max stress mode. Moreover, both the interface trap generation and the electron trapping are two important factors to induce the electrical parameters shifts of asymmetric nDeMOS transistors under Ib,max and HE stress. 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The novelty is that the minimally-invasiveness of injection whose resolution is less than 10 μm, and hence cellular-scale injection can be possible without any pain. The novelty of the present techniques are (1) unique robust thick structure at the tip of the narrowed glass capillary for operation in air, (2) damper structure produce closed space to fill in reagent which enabled the injector to be used in air and (3) construction part to support inner probe to make self-aligned coaxial positioning for accurate injection. The injector can be used for any kind of materials with various hardness, owing to the strong impact of cavitation phenomenon when the high-speed micro-bubbles are collapsed. The fine adjustment of injection can be controlled by the number of applied electric pulses. The developed injector can be used for wide range of biomedical study, especially in gene therapy. This technique has advantages over the conventional electroporation or ultrasound operation in terms of localization of injection and ability of transportation of material.	internationalization and localization	Kazuki Takahashi;Shun Omi;Yoko Yamanishi	2014	2014 International Symposium on Micro-NanoMechatronics and Human Science (MHS)	10.1109/MHS.2014.7006059	electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;analytical chemistry	Arch	92.36803868210981	-20.32384834610439	24931

For this purpose a two-dimensional hybrid MD-DSMC code is developed. In this method gas-surface interactions are modeled using MD, and gas-gas interactions are modeled using DSMC method. Two-way coupling between MD and DSMC is implemented by employing buffer zones for both MD and DSMC regions. Bootstrap sampling and energy minimization algorithms are employed for dynamic coupling of these two methods since MD utilizes real number of molecules during simulation whereas DSMC utilizes a lesser number of simulated molecules. The hybrid methodology combines the advantages of both methods; it has the capability of modeling the gas-surface interaction accurately considering the effect of the presence of neighboring real number of gas molecules, while in the bulk it utilizes DSMC with only the simulated number of molecules thus increasing the computational efficiency significantly compared to pure MD codes. As a result comparatively large domain sizes can be simulated with realistic behavior at the walls. The utility of the hybrid method is demonstrated by simulating high Kn flows through a micro-channel, micro-nozzle and micro-scale shock tube. The effect of partial accommodation of gas molecules with the wall is seen to be captured dynamically with this approach.	computation;computational resource;direct simulation monte carlo;mike lesser;molecular dynamics;random-access memory;velocity (software development)	D.

Using PWE method, the dependence of dispersion on structure parameters is calculated. We compared the dispersion relations between the circular air holes PCF and the elliptic one. We find that the flatter dispersion curve and single mode in PCF can be realized by adjusting the width and the holes pitch. The single mode can be obtained by rotating the angle of elliptic air hole and two modes will become one mode.

The top attack of C-atom of CF radical at the N-atom of NO2 molecule first forms the adduct isomer FCNO21 followed by oxygen-shift to give trans-OC(F)NO 2 and then to cis-OC(F)NO 3. Subsequently, the most favorable channel is a direct dissociation of 2 and 3 to product P1 FCO+NO. The second and third less favorable channels are direct dissociation of 3 to product P2 FNO+CO and isomerization of 3 to a complex NOFCO 4, which can easily dissociate to product P3 FON+CO, respectively. The large exothermicity released in these processes further drives most of the three products P1, P2, and P3 to take secondary dissociation to the final product P12 F+CO+NO. Another energetically allowed channel is formation of product P41NF+CO2, yet it is much less competitive than P1, P2, P3, and P12. The present calculations can well interpret one recent experimental fact that the title reaction is quite fast yet still much slower than the analogous reaction CH+NO2. Also, the results presented in this article may be useful for future product distribution analysis of the title reaction as well as for the analogous CCl and CBr reactions. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

369585e694ae0fde7561e10fd13ff77d03af07a0	torbeam 2.0, a paraxial beam tracing code for electron-cyclotron beams in fusion plasmas for extended physics applications		Abstract The paraxial WKB code TORBEAM (Poli, 2001) is widely used for the description of electron-cyclotron waves in fusion plasmas, retaining diffraction effects through the solution of a set of ordinary differential equations. With respect to its original form, the code has undergone significant transformations and extensions, in terms of both the physical model and the spectrum of applications. The code has been rewritten in Fortran 90 and transformed into a library, which can be called from within different (not necessarily Fortran-based) workflows. The models for both absorption and current drive have been extended, including e.g. fully-relativistic calculation of the absorption coefficient, momentum conservation in electron–electron collisions and the contribution of more than one harmonic to current drive. The code can be run also for reflectometry applications, with relativistic corrections for the electron mass. Formulas that provide the coupling between the reflected beam and the receiver have been developed. Accelerated versions of the code are available, with the reduced physics goal of inferring the location of maximum absorption (including or not the total driven current) for a given setting of the launcher mirrors. Optionally, plasma volumes within given flux surfaces and corresponding values of minimum and maximum magnetic field can be provided externally to speed up the calculation of full driven-current profiles. These can be employed in real-time control algorithms or for fast data analysis.	beam tracing;electron	E. Poli;A. Bock;M. Lochbrunner;Omar Maj;M. Reich;A. Snicker;Andreas Stegmeir;F. Volpe;N.

Flow fields are predicted by solution of the density-weighted transport equations expressing conservation of mass and momentum, with closure achieved through the  k – ɛ  turbulence model and a second-moment closure. The particle phase is calculated using a Lagrangian particle tracking technique which involves solving the particle momentum equation in a form that accounts for the spatial, temporal and directional correlations of the Reynolds stresses experienced by a particle. The two phases are coupled via modification of the fluid-phase momentum equations. Predictions of the complete model are validated against available experimental data on a number of single-phase and two-phase, gas–solid jet flows with various particle loadings, and both mono- and poly-dispersed particle size distributions. Overall, predictions of the models compare favourably with the data examined, with results obtained from the anisotropic second-moment turbulence closure being superior to eddy viscosity-based predictions.	turbulence	Michael Fairweather;J.-P.

The calculations were performed in the framework of the Robert-Bonamy method, in which the exact trajectory model was incorporated. Parameters of the interaction potentials, chosen in the form of atom-atom potentials, were optimized to give the best agreement with the existing experimental data. With the exception of the some data the agreement between the calculated and experimentally measured broadening coefficients γ is satisfactory for the ν$ _{1}$ and ν$ _{3}$ bands of H$_{2}$S for all collisional partners. The measured strong J-dependence of helium broadening in the ν$ _{2}$ band did not appear in the calculation. Besides, it was found that an interaction potential for H$_{2}$S- He system is ambiguously determined. The optimal set of the parameters for H$_{2}$S- He interaction potential was used in the calculation of the helium broadening coefficients for the ν$ _{1}$ band of H$_{2}$S (J l 15, 100 K l T l 1000K) and then for their analytical representation.

For dimers and trimers, the lowest energy structures are cyclic (IIs, IIIs) with D(nh) symmetry. The caged structure with Td symmetry (Xs) lie lowest in energy among the tetramers. The Al--P bond dominates the structures for many isomers so that one preferred dissociation channel is loss of the AlP monomer. The hybridization and chemical bonding in the different structures are also discussed. Comparisons with silicon and boron nitride clusters, the ground state structures of Al(n)P(n) clusters are analogous to those of their corresponding Si(2n) counterparts. This similarity follows the isoelectronic principle.	density functional theory;electronic structure;functional theories of grammar;ground state;holographic principle;isomerism;nucleic acid hybridization;pyschological bonding;silicon;aluminum phosphide;boron nitride;monomer	Yuhui Qu;Xiufang Bian	2005	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.20146	atomic physics;chemistry;computational chemistry;density functional theory;physics;electronic structure;quantum mechanics	Comp.	97.24629462343763	-6.090702691836344	25723

First, the capacitive coupling of the back gate and the liquid gate via an Ag/AgCl electrode were compared in water. It was found that for liquid gating smaller potentials are needed to obtain similar responses of the nanowire compared to back gating. In the case of back gating, the applied potential couples through the buried oxide layer, indicating that the associated capacitance dominates all other capacitances involved during this mode of operation. Next, the devices were exposed to mixtures of water and dioxane to study the effect of these mixtures on the device characteristics, including the threshold voltage (V(T)). The V(T) dependency on the mixture composition was found to be related to the decreased dissociation of the surface silanol groups and the conductivity of the mixture used. This latter was confirmed by experiments with constant conductivity and varying water-dioxane mixtures.	block cipher mode of operation;dioxanes;experiment;nanowires;silicon on insulator;silver;small;top-down and bottom-up design;transistor;water model;emotional dependency;mixture;silanol;voltage	Marleen Mescher;Aldo G.

This setup is presented, including the preconditioner which is necessary for the newly implemented Jacobi–Davidson solver. The fast computation of instabilities at a single parameter set is exploited to make parameter scans viable, that is to compute the solution at many points in the parameter space. Several issues related to parameter scans are discussed, such as an efficient parallelization over parameter sets and subspace recycling.	approximation algorithm;ct scan;computation;control theory;experiment;gauss–jacobi quadrature;goto;initial condition;iterative method;jacobi method;normal mode;numerical method;parallel computing;plasma active;preconditioner;slepc;solver;speedup;test case;turbulence	F.

The focus of the present experiments are secondary disturbances of the boundary layer which is modulated by stationary streamwise vortices. Both the stationary vortices and the secondary oscillations of interest are generated in a controlled manner. The experimental data are obtained through hot-wire measurements. Thus, evolution of the vortices, either isolated or interacting with each other, is reconstructed in detail. As is found, the secondary disturbances, initiating the laminar-flow breakdown, are strongly affected by configuration of the stationary boundary-layer perturbation that may have an implication to laminar–turbulent transition control.	experiment;instability;interaction;modulation;quantum vortex;stationary process;subsonic;turbulence;velocity (software development)	Valery G.

The essence of the problem is to ensure compatibility of the displacements at the interfac e. This is achieved by equating the work done at the d imensional interface by the 3D nodes with the work done at the 1D node. This is carried out in a mann er similar to that used in the development of Reiss ner plate theory and leads to 6 multipoint constraint e quations, one for each degree of freedom of the nod e in the 1D element. The methods used to achieve the co upling for axial force, bending moment, shear force and torsion are discussed and it is shown that the proposed technique does not introduce any spurious stresses at the dimensional interface.	multipoint ground;torsion (gastropod)	Dermot J.

It is found that light leakage of the white pixel adjacent to the emitting green pixel is the highest level, due to the shortened optical path and high transmittance of the white-CF layer. As the optical path between the adjacent pixels decreases, light-leakage induced EL intensity of the white or blue pixel increases, while there is no appreciable change in the EL intensity of the emitting green pixel. Also, the observed light leakage and the corresponding power spectrum highly increase as the orientation of emitted dipole sources is perpendicular to the interfaces of the layered structures. Therefore, the presented analysis of the light leakage in the CF stacked white OLED provides useful guidelines to improve the device performance for high-resolution OLED displays.	oled;pixel;spectral leakage	Jong-Kwon Lee;Seunghyun Cho;Dong Wan Kang	2016	Displays	10.1016/j.displa.2016.09.001	electroluminescence;electronic engineering;optoelectronics;optics;physics	HCI	91.69249192317854	-14.008118927290237	26383

A single ring-shaped electrostatic sensor is used to derive a signal, from which two crucial parameters-velocity and mass flow rate of solids-may be determined for the purpose of monitoring and control. It is found that the quantified characteristics of the signal are related to the velocity and mass flow rate of solids. The relationships between the signal characteristics and the two measurands are established through the use of backpropagation (BP) neural networks.

The possible existence of new phenomena associated to the richer topology has been discussed and examples of these differences have been systematically searched. Here, we show that the interconnectivity of the layers may have an important impact on the speed of the dynamics run in the network and that microscopic changes such as the addition of one single inter-layer link can notably affect the arrival at a global stationary state. As a practical verification, these results obtained with spectral techniques are confirmed with a Kuramoto dynamics for which the synchronization consistently delays after the addition of single inter-layer links.	kuramoto model;multiplexing;programming paradigm;stationary state	Marina Diakonova;José J.

Failures of rock bolts occur as a result of overloading, corrosion, seismic burst and bad grouting, leading to catastrophic economic and personnel losses. Monitoring the health condition of the rock bolts plays an important role in ensuring the safe operation of underground mines. This work presents a brief introduction on the types of rock bolts followed by a comprehensive review of rock bolt monitoring using smart sensors. Smart sensors that are used to assess rock bolt integrity are reviewed to provide a firm perception of the application of smart sensors for enhanced performance and reliability of rock bolts. The most widely used smart sensors for rock bolt monitoring are the piezoelectric sensors and the fiber optic sensors. The methodologies and principles of these smart sensors are reviewed from the point of view of rock bolt integrity monitoring. The applications of smart sensors in monitoring the critical status of rock bolts, such as the axial force, corrosion occurrence, grout quality and resin delamination, are highlighted. In addition, several prototypes or commercially available smart rock bolt devices are also introduced.	coal;corrosion of medical device material;failure;fiber optic technology;function overloading;models, economic;optical fiber;piezoelectricity;resin;sensor (device)	Gangbing Song;Weijie Li;Bo Wang;Siu Chun Michael Ho	2017		10.3390/s17040776	structural engineering;piezoelectric sensor;nondestructive testing;engineering;fiber optic sensor;geotechnical engineering;forensic engineering;rock bolt	SE	90.26366814563953	-21.332777533331075	26770

In the fabrication process, the photo sensitive acrylic resin paste mixed with micrometer sized metallic glass of Fe72B14.4Si9.6Nb4 and oxide glass of B2O3·Bi2O3 particles was spread on a metal substrate, and cross sectional images of ultra violet ray were exposed. Through the layer by layer stacking, micro lattice structures with a diamond type periodic arrangement were successfully formed. The composite structures could be obtained through the dewaxing and sintering process with the lower temperature under the transition point of metallic glass. Transmission spectra of the terahertz waves through the magnetophotonic crystals were measured by using a terahertz time domain spectroscopy.	freeform surface modelling;paste;resin;semiconductor device fabrication;software bug;stacking	Soshu Kirihara;Maasa Nakano	2013	Micromachines	10.3390/mi4020149	materials science;ceramic materials;optics	Graphics	90.82061839906365	-15.215590938907637	26819
c5f51a24f695bee37f261aecf963d74fadbea173	on the zeroth-order hamiltonian for caspt2 calculations of spin crossover compounds	molecular magnetism;spin crossover;computational chemistry	Complete active space self-consistent field theory (CASSCF) calculations and subsequent second-order perturbation theory treatment (CASPT2) are discussed in the evaluation of the spin-states energy difference (ΔH(elec)) of a series of seven spin crossover (SCO) compounds. The reference values have been extracted from a combination of experimental measurements and DFT + U calculations, as discussed in a recent article (Vela et al., Phys Chem Chem Phys 2015, 17, 16306). It is definitely proven that the critical IPEA parameter used in CASPT2 calculations of ΔH(elec), a key parameter in the design of SCO compounds, should be modified with respect to its default value of 0.25 a.u. and increased up to 0.50 a.u. The satisfactory agreement observed previously in the literature might result from an error cancellation originated in the default IPEA, which overestimates the stability of the HS state, and the erroneous atomic orbital basis set contraction of carbon atoms, which stabilizes the LS states.	basis set (chemistry);default;extraction;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);hartree–fock method;ipea;least squares;molecular orbital;multi-configurational self-consistent field;normal range;perturbation theory;population parameter;q-chem;quantum field theory;spin labels	Sergi Vela;Maria Fumanal;Jordi Ribas-Ariño;Vincent Robert	2016	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.24283	chemistry;computational chemistry;nuclear magnetic resonance;condensed matter physics	Logic	97.27945252479284	-4.571135294909784	26916

We consider a source with limited spatial and temporal support that generates spherically diverging waves. The waves propagate in a random medium whose fluctuations have small amplitude and correlation radius larger than the typical wavelength but smaller than the propagation distance. In a regime of separation of scales we prove that the wave is modified in two ways by the interaction with the random medium: first, its time profile is affected by a deterministic diffusive and dispersive convolution; second the wave fronts are affected by random perturbations that can be described in terms of a Gaussian process whose amplitude is of the order of the wavelength and whose correlation radius is of the order of the correlation radius of the medium. Both effects depend on the two-point statistics of the random medium.	approximation;convolution;dispersive partial differential equation;gaussian process;software propagation	Josselin Garnier;Knut Sølna	2012	Multiscale Modeling & Simulation	10.1137/110846038	waves;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;asymptotic analysis;wave propagation;mathematics;optics;mechanical wave	ML	88.18050538089862	2.430343767953385	27243

The copper-copper interactions were modelled by the EAM potential and the copper-diamond interactions were modelled by the Morse potential. The diamond tool was modelled as a deformable body and the Tersoff potential was applied for the carbon-carbon interactions. It was observed that the average tangential and normal components of the cutting forces increase with increase in depth of cut and they reduced in consecutive cutting passes for each depth of cut. Also, the ratio of the tangential to normal force components decreases as the depth of cut increases, but remains fairly constant after 1.5nm depth of cut. The ratio of the cutting force to area decreases with increase in the depth of cut and remains constant after 2.5nm depth of cut.	bond order potential;embedded atom model;interaction;molecular dynamics;simulation	A.

Finally, charge pumping measurements on devices with several fin widths devices apparently show a higher density of defects in the top-wall high-j oxide than in the sidewall of the fin. This could explain more severe PBTI degradation. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis of the dried cake structure and particularly the estimation of its porosity and permeability, is fundamental for the selection of the optimal process conditions and also for the product quality control. Furthermore, the product structure has a dramatic impact on the drying behavior as it determines the resistance offered by the dried product to the vapor flow generated by the ice sublimation. This parameter, that allows one to relate sublimation rate to partial pressure gradients, is gaining growing importance in recent years, as it is necessary for the application of the most modern model-based methods for the design of the freeze-drying cycle. This parameter is difficult to be measured so new measuring approaches are required to make its estimation easier. In this study a bi-dimensional Fourier analysis is used for image processing of the internal structure of lyophilised samples and, then, for the estimation of their mass transfer coefficient.	biological specimen;coefficient;dye-sublimation printer;experiment;fast fourier transform;fourier analysis;freeze (software engineering);gradient;image processing	Marco Parvis;Sabrina Grassini;Emma Angelini;Roberto Pisano;Antonello A.

During last decades, a number of different sensors have been developing for different analytics to detect. A key aspect of those sensors is that each of them results with a fixed particular sensitivity. Consequently, at occurrence, it is necessary to use a plurality of sensors to arrange measures with different levels of sensitivity. This work intends to investigate the possibility to obtain different sensitivity, in particular with respect to humidity, from one sensor only. To this aim we investigated the resistive flex sensor, which has been already used for other applications but, as far as we know, never investigated for its potential properties as a chemical sensor. Results demonstrated how the resistive flex sensor behaves with different sensitivity values and different sensitivity curves for different bend conditions.	sensor	Giovanni Saggio;Arnaldo D'Amico;Vito Errico;Giovanni Costantini;Giorgio Pennazza;Alessandro Zompanti;Marco Santonico	2018		10.5220/0006546001130118	machine learning;humidity;computer science;artificial intelligence;remote sensing	AI	92.23922779294023	-18.601089382246712	27778

The model uses the volume-averaging principles and combines the features of the enthalpy method for modeling growth, immersed boundary method for handling the rigid solid-liquid interfaces, and the volume of fluid method for tracking the advection of the dendrite. The algorithm also performs explicit-implicit coupling between the techniques used. A two-dimensional framework with incompressible and Newtonian fluid is considered. Validation with available literature is performed and dendrite growth in the presence of rotational and buoyancy driven flow fields is studied. It is seen that the flow fields significantly alter the position and morphology of the dendrites.		Shyamprasad Karagadde;Anirban Bhattacharya;Gaurav Tomar;Pradip Dutta	2012	J. Comput.

Cyclic clusters of different sizes were chosen as model systems. The convergence of the bulk properties of the perfect clusters with increasing cluster size was tested. Single and multiple substitution of oxygen atoms in zinc oxide by sulfur and of sulfur atoms in zinc sulfide by oxygen served to determine the energetics of substitution for these two cases. It was found that the substitution of oxygen by sulfur in ZnO is easier than the substitution of sulfur by oxygen in ZnS in agreement with experimental results. The interaction between two oxygen atoms vs. two selenium atoms in zinc sulfide was investigated. Oscillations of the cluster energy in dependence of the distance between the two doping atoms were observed. These are explained by the relative sites of the doping atoms in the crystal lattice. The magnitude of the oscillations is smaller in ZnS:Se than in ZnS:O, because the difference between the anion radii of S2- and Se2- is smaller than between S2- and O2-. This is also reflected in the band gap.	anions;computational chemistry;convergence (action);crystal structure;doping (semiconductor);doping in sports;molecular orbital;oxygen;selenium;small;status epilepticus;sulfides;superoxides;zaf;zinc oxide;zinc pyrithione 10 mg/ml medicated shampoo;zinc sulfide	Karl Jug;Viatcheslav A.

Furthermore, a new contact model called Gears Model is proposed and successfully tested. It avoids the use of numerical artifices such as repulsive forces between adjacent beads, a source of numerical difficulties in the temporal integration of previous Bead Models.

We show that thermoelastic damping (TED) appears to be the dominant cause of energy dissipation. The resonator is fabricated in single-crystal silicon (SCS). According to finite-element (FE) analysis, the uniform isochoric property of the Lamé mode is no longer preserved when etch holes are introduced. This results in marked drop in quality factor (Q) by 98.5% for the Lamé mode and 75.7% for the extensional from measurements. FE analysis based on coupled thermoelastic equations is used to compute the the thermal gradients that give rise to TED when etch holes are added to the resonator.	amplitude damping channel;cpu power dissipation;debian;finite element method;gradient	Cheng Tu;Joshua E.-Y.

The method proposed allows one to obtain the results of phonon symmetry analysis for nanotubes in Mulliken designations, which are traditional for molecules and crystallographic point groups. The approach suggested is applied to the phonon symmetry analysis in the single-wall carbon and MoS2 -based nanotubes. First-principles calculations of phonons in a bulk MoS2 crystal and a monolayer S-Mo-S are made. The results obtained are in reasonable agreement with the existing experimental data and other published results. The first-principles calculations of the phonon frequencies for armchair and zigzag MoS2 nanotubes are performed for the first time. It is shown that the number of infrared and Raman active modes becomes fixed starting from the relatively small nanotube diameters. The correlation of the phonon modes of MoS2 nanotubes with diameters up to 3.64 nm with phonon modes of the S-Mo-S monolayer is analyzed. It is demonstrated that the interpretation of the nature of nanotube A-type modes in the crystallographic factorization of the line group L = TF is the same as for m = 0 modes in the """"polymer type"""" factorization L = ZP where P is the subgroup of the isogonal point group F, T is the translation subgroup of line group and the cyclic group Z includes the one-dimensional translations and the rotations around the screw axes or the reflections in the glide planes. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."""

7500edd9cd13d8f2a08d070944bce640a8b36854	data-driven tactile sensing using spatially overlapping signals		Traditional methods for achieving high localization accuracy on tactile sensors usually involve a matrix of miniaturized individual sensors distributed on the area of interest. This approach usually comes at a price of increased complexity in fabrication and circuitry, and can be hard to adapt to non-planar geometries. We propose a method where sensing terminals are embedded in a volume of soft material. Mechanical strain in this material results in a measurable signal between any two given terminals. By having multiple terminals and pairing them against each other in all possible combinations, we obtain a rich signal set using few wires. We mine this data to learn the mapping between the signals we extract and the contact parameters of interest. Our approach is general enough that it can be applied with different transduction methods, and achieves high accuracy in identifying indentation location and depth. Moreover, this method lends itself to simple fabrication techniques and makes no assumption about the underlying geometry, potentially simplifying future integration in robot hands.	complexity;electronic circuit;embedded system;semiconductor device fabrication;tactile sensor;transduction (machine learning)	Pedro Piacenza;Emily Hannigan;Clayton Baumgart;Yuchen Xiao;Steve Park;Keith Behrman;Weipeng Dang;Jeremy Espinal;Ikram Hussain;Ioannis Kymissis;Matei T.

It is demonstrated that a standalone random metal grid can suppress the starburst phenomenon to a great extent. By way of ray tracing simulation, we have found that specular reflection of light on the gentle slope of the patterned edges of metallic grids contributes to the generation of starburst patterns. It is also addressed that employing a light-absorbing material and increasing metal grid spacing can reduce the intensity of starburst patterns.	ray tracing (graphics);touchscreen	Dong-Kyun Shin;Jongwoon Park	2014	Displays	10.1016/j.displa.2014.05.004	ray tracing;computer science;optics;engineering drawing;computer graphics (images)	HCI	89.58534382532477	-14.934879959218815	28642

The ORDs exhibit a high degree of air-stability without any passivation with extremely reliable reproducibility. ORDs were fabricated on polyethylene naphthalate foils in a vertical sandwich structure with gold and aluminium as the injecting and blocking electrodes respectively via evaporation with the OSC spin-coated in between (Type1). In order to improve device performance of the ORDs, poly(ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) was μ-dispensed as a hole-injection layer (Type2). The results for Type1-diodes show a really narrow spread of the diode characteristics, whereas for Type2 diodes the spread is slightly more but still acceptable. These ORDs prove themselves better than conventional pentacene diodes both in terms of reliability/repeatability of the diode performance and air-stability without an encapsulation layer, and goes towards the enabling of a viable and reliable low-cost fabrication method of radio frequency identification-tags using organic semiconductors.	diode;radio-frequency identification;rectifier	Indranil Bose;Kornelius Tetzner;Kathrin Borner;Karlheinz Bock	2014	Microelectronics Reliability	10.1016/j.microrel.2014.07.050	roll-to-roll processing;electronic engineering;optoelectronics	HCI	91.61519524557117	-13.766149763978733	28778
b16edfffb3dc384303b1f9426e45099fea0291d9	performance evaluation of ppp-botda-based distributed optical fiber sensors	期刊论文	The basic sensing behaviors of Pulse-Prepump Brillouin Optical Time Domain Analysis(PPP-BOTDA-) based distributed fiber optic sensors (DFOSs) with a spatial resolution on the order of 0.1 m are first experimentally studied. Second, the sensing results for different types of optical fibres are compared. Based on these investigations, the performance of PPP-BOTDA—based DFOSs for crack monitoring is evaluated. The experimental results show that in the interior of an optical fibre, slippage between the bare fiber and the coating materials occurs and that different types of optical fibres have different degrees of slippage. Point fixation bonding methods can produce effective and correct measurement results when the gauge length of the optical fibre is longer than the critical effective sensing length (CESL), whereas the overall bonding method is still not feasible for monitoring localized deformation quantitatively. Finally, the differences between Brillouin Optical Time Domain Reflectometry (BOTDR) and BOTDA are discussed.	brillouin scattering;experiment;optical fiber;password cracking;performance evaluation;point-to-point protocol;sensor;time-domain reflectometry	Hao Zhang;Zhi Shen Wu	2012	IJDSN	10.1155/2012/414692	distributed acoustic sensing;computer science;fiber optic sensor	Visualization	91.41039292143788	-19.773757006162505	28825

It is found that the net flowrate of a micro-pump increased with pumping frequency and opening angle. However, a level off phenomenon of the net flowrate vs. amplitude is seen at an amplitude nearby 150-200 µm and at an opening angle above 10 degree. This phenomenon is associated with two factors that compensate with each other. One is the free jet flow from the outlet that overturns and blocks the flow from the inlet. The other is the reduction of the strength of the jet flow at a larger amplitude owing to effective increase of cross sectional area.	cross section (geometry);numerical analysis;pumping (computer systems)	Kai-Shing Yang;Ing-Young Chen;Kuo-Hsiang Chien;Chi-Chuan Wang	2004	2004 International Conference on MEMS, NANO and Smart Systems (ICMENS'04)	10.1109/ICMENS.2004.18	structural engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;cross section;engineering drawing	EDA	86.98292340608944	-11.382770018458329	29025

According to our trajectory calculations, a dynamic behavior of nonstatistical central barrier recrossing is revealed. Among the 64 trajectories calculated in this work, 45 trajectories follow the dynamic reaction pathways as assumed by statistical theory and other 19 trajectories with central barrier recrossings are nonstatistical. For the nonstatistical trajectories, the central barrier recrossings may originate from the inefficient kinetic energy transfer from the intramolecular modes of the NH(2)F(a) moiety in the dynamic F(b)(-)…H-NH-F(a) complex to the intermolecular modes of the dynamic F(b)(-)…H-NH-F(a) complex on the exit-channel potential energy surface. With respect to the dynamic behavior of the nonstatistical central barrier recrossing, the statistical theories such as the Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus and transition state theories without further corrections cannot be used to model the reaction kinetics for this S(N)2 reaction.	assumed;energy transfer;kinetics internet protocol;nethack;potential energy surface	Feng Yu	2012	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.21979	chemistry;organic chemistry;computational chemistry;physical chemistry;sn2 reaction	HCI	95.15036326115163	-4.803783876019097	29074

The method is applied to the plasma etching of thin lms for semiconductor manufacturing. Results are obtained within the mathematical framework of level set methods. Here, the evolution of the curve under study is captured through the evolution of a level set function. The underying physics of the process are completely contained in a scalar function called the speed function. The degree of diiculty of treating the evolution equation depends on the functional dependencies of the speed function. This paper presents optimal estimation and design techniques based on analytical gradient computations for a class of position and orientation dependent speed functions. The technique is demonstrated on a plasma etching model taken from the literature. Only simulation results are presented here, but the model under study has been shown to reproduce experimental data with reasonable accuracy. In the estimation problem, parameters in the model are t to best match the feature shape measured in experiments. In the optimal design problem, parameter values are selected to most closely attain a desired feature shape.	computation;evolution;experiment;functional dependency;gradient;nonlinear system;optimal design;plasma active;plasma etching;semiconductor device fabrication;simulation	Jordan M.

24d266ad36e230d94720f0eaf4e3d5282c7bbad7	a cyclic scanning repeater for enhancing the remote distance of lc passive wireless sensors		Inductor-capacitor (LC) passive wireless sensors have been used in situations where wired connections are impossible. When this scheme is applied to implanted or sealed fields, the sensors are required to be scaled down to small dimensions, which results in the limited remote distance. Here we present an approach to enhance the remote readout distance of the LC sensors by a cyclic-scanning repeater. The resonant frequency of the repeater is cyclic-scanned so as to detect that of the LC sensor, and the readout distance is enhanced by strong magnetic coupling. The proposed full-spectrum-enhancing approach has the simplified circuits when compared with other readout enhancement ways. An LC humidity sensor, as an example, is then monitored both with and without the proposed repeater. We have demonstrated that the readout distance with the cyclic-scanning repeater can achieve 3 times long as that without a repeater, while keeping the same for their signal intensity and sensitivity. Overall, this approach with the cyclic-scanning repeater enables a longer detection range and broader applications in the implanted or sealed fields.	full-spectrum light;inductive coupling;passive optical network;resonance;sensor	Lei Dong;Lifeng Wang	2016	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2016.2572221	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	Mobile	91.51208302338297	-20.31424200321786	29168

Disposable carbon tip electrodes were used for Cd(II), Cu(II) and Pb(II) ion quantification, while Zn(II) did not give signal in this electrode configuration. In order to detect all mentioned heavy metals simultaneously, thin-film mercury electrodes (TFME) were fabricated by electrodeposition of mercury on the surface of carbon tips. In comparison with bare electrodes the TMFEs had lower detection limits and better sensitivity. In addition to pure aqueous heavy metal solutions, the assay was also performed on mineralized rock samples, artificial blood plasma samples and samples of chicken embryo organs treated with cadmium. An artificial neural network was created to evaluate the concentrations of the mentioned heavy metals correctly in mixture samples and an excellent fit was observed (R2 = 0.9933).	3d film;artificial neural network;blood substitutes;blood substitute;cadmium;copper;electroplating;embryo;fluorescence;interaction;ions;mathematical model;mathematics;mercury;metals;metals, heavy;network model;numerous;organ;plasma active;quantitation;regression analysis;solutions;spectrometry, x-ray emission;spectrophotometry, atomic absorption;time complexity;zinc;cupric cation;electrode;exponential;mixture	Jirí Kudr;Hoai Viet Nguyen;Jaromir Gumulec;Lukas Nejdl;Iva Blazkova;Branislav Ruttkay-Nedecky;David Hynek;Jindrich Kynicky;Vojtech Adam;René Kizek	2014		10.3390/s150100592	lead;calibration;chemistry;electrochemistry;analytical chemistry;environmental chemistry;automation;zinc;environmental analysis;cadmium;copper;robotics;mercury;metallurgy;regression analysis	Robotics	96.15430616448816	-18.11389189469165	29205

Rev. Lett. 106 (2011) 046102] for ionic liquids is applied to and numerically studied for electrolytes and biological ion channels in three-dimensional space. This is a fourth-order nonlinear PDE that deals with both steric and correlation effects of all ions and solvent molecules involved in a model system. The Fermi distribution follows from classical lattice models of configurational entropy of finite size ions and solvent molecules and hence prevents the long and outstanding problem of unphysical divergence predicted by the Gouy–Chapman model at large potentials due to the Boltzmann distribution of point charges. The equation reduces to Poisson–Boltzmann if the correlation length vanishes. A simplified matched interface and boundary method exhibiting optimal convergence is first developed for this equation by using a gramicidin A channel model that illustrates challenging issues associated with the geometric singularities of molecular surfaces of channel proteins in realistic 3D simulations. Various numerical methods then follow to tackle a range of numerical problems concerning the fourth-order term, nonlinearity, stability, efficiency, and effectiveness. The most significant feature of the Poisson–Fermi equation, namely, its inclusion of steric and correlation effects, is demonstrated by showing good agreement with Monte Carlo simulation data for a charged wall model and an L type calcium channel model.	numerical analysis;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations	Jinn-Liang Liu	2013	J.

This paper presents a bond-graph model of a piezostack driven jetting dispenser that can dispense adhesive fluids accurately, rapidly, and flexibly. After describing the structural components and operating principles of the dispenser, the bond-graph model for the system is derived by integrating the electromechanical model with the fluid model. In the bond-graph model, the lumped parameter method is employed to obtain the conceptual bond-graph elements of the adhesive in the channels. Based on the proposed model, the jetting dispenser is designed and manufactured, and its performance is then evaluated through both computer simulations and experiments.

Injection methods such as central point, one line, L-type and U-type are studied. Cross-viscosity model and volume of fluid (VOF) technique are applied for melt front tracking of the encapsulant. The melt front profiles and pressure field for all injection types are analyzed and presented. The pressure distribution within the flip-chip, fill volume versus filling time and viscosity versus shear rate are also plotted. The U-type injection is found to be faster in filling.

BMRPF was synthesised with optimum composition obtained by vibration sample magnetometer (VSM) test and magnetorheological characterisation which gives maximum magnetisation and yield behaviour. A five-levels three-factors central composite design of experiments (DOE) was used to develop an experimental plan for investigating process parameters' effect on percentage reduction in surface roughness (%ΔRs). Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to predict profile and surface roughness. Experiments were conducted on mild steel and surface roughness before and after experiments were measured. An effective second order response surface model for %ΔRs was obtained with significant factors and their interactions.

The polymers were characterized by two internal coordinates: the number of monomer units and branching bonds. Three commonly used mechanisms for depolymerization (random chain, end chain, and random debranching scission) were applied and formulated such that only physically possible polymers were created. The mechanisms and the population balance equation were formulated in a mixed continuous–discrete manner. The population balance equation was solved using the Direct Quadrature Method of Moments (DQMOM). With this algorithm, the time evolution of the distribution with respect to the internal coordinate was computed. In addition, the algorithm was validated through comparison with Monte Carlo simulations. Notably, the accuracy of the mixed continuous–discrete formulation was significantly higher that of the continuous formulation. However, DQMOM was found to be unsuitable for describing the temporal evolution of the distribution for random scission.	numerical partial differential equations	Christoph Kirse;Heiko Briesen	2015	Computers & Chemical Engineering	10.1016/j.compchemeng.2014.11.008	mathematical optimization;chemistry;polymer;calculus;computational chemistry	DB	92.2723091228093	2.260229394005873	29838

This communication describes an active device operable at temperatures as high as 500°C and consisting of a tunnel diode p-n junction1 formed by alloying Si to crystals of very heavily doped p-type hexagonal Sic. The diode is made by using a very fast alloying cycle similar to those used to produce tunnel diodes in such materials as Ge or GaAs. The I–V characteristics have been generally similar to those of tunnel diodes produced in these materials, but the peak-to-valley current ratios achieved so far have been much lower, the highest value being 1.37.	diode	Richard F.

659cf1c6621e2f2849d5de6383ae6ed818aaebde	achieving sub-10-nm resolution using scanning electron beam lithography	electrical engineering and computer science;thesis	Achieving the highest possible resolution using scanning-electron-beam lithography (SEBL) has become an increasingly urgent problem in recent years, as advances in various nanotechnology applications have driven demand for feature sizes well into the sub-10-nm domain. While SEBL has the highest resolution of nearly any conventional patterning technique available, reliably defining features at these length scales has been a challenge, as well as an interesting scientific problem. In this work I have investigated, both theoretically and experimentally, many of the factors that limit SEBL resolution and attempted to understand and minimize their influence on the process. This includes resist development, where we have thoroughly characterized the temperature dependence of poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) resist contrast and used the results to create transferable patterns smaller than nearly any published results to date with this resist chemistry. We have also examined the process of electron-beam exposure and attempted to characterize the various factors that affect the way energy is distributed in the resist by the beam, using theoretical arguments, Monte Carlo simulations, and experimental data. We have used the results of these investigations to create some of the smallest structures reported to date, using hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) resist. Finally, we have applied some of the previously-gained knowledge to the design of a unique bilayer process for patterning high-resolution metal structures using evaporation and liftoff, while simultaneously developing a broadlyuseful new model for the kinetics of resist development.	electron;evaporation;experiment;hydrogen;hydrogen-like atom;image resolution;kinetics internet protocol;monte carlo method;simulation	Bryan M.

The practical implementation using numeric atom-centered orbitals as basis functions is demonstrated exemplarily for the allelectron Fritz Haber Institute ab initio molecular simulations (FHI-aims) package. The convergence of the calculations with respect to numerical parameters is carefully investigated and a systematic comparison with finite-difference approaches is performed both for finite (molecules) and extended (periodic) systems. Finally, the scaling tests and scalability tests on massively parallel computer systems demonstrate the computational efficiency. © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Calculation models for IMCCR electromagnetic field and whole region (including stator and rotor) temperature field analyses are established. From a motor electromagnetic analysis using the finite-element method, loss distributions are obtained, which are taken as the heat source in thermal analysis. In this paper, the starting and thermal performances of IMCCR operating under rated load are studied. From the comparison of the obtained results with test data, it can be seen that IMCCR would be a better choice for the driving system in electrical vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrid EVs (PHEVs). Furthermore, the influences of compound bar material on motor temperature distribution are analyzed, which would be helpful for the research on electrical materials used in machines. Considering the working conditions of motor used in PHEV and EV, the effects of ambient temperature and output load on motor thermal performance also have been studied.	electrical engineering;extended validation certificate;finite element method;hybrid kernel;performance;plug-in (computing);r.o.t.o.r.;structural load;test data	Weili Li;Junci Cao;Xiaochen Zhang	2010	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2009.2033088	control engineering;squirrel-cage rotor;electromagnetic field;engineering;electrical engineering;finite element method;automotive engineering;induction motor;physics;quantum mechanics	Robotics	84.58823925079977	-12.346081186032182	30734

Using the hydrophilic/hydrophobic character values along with balance between them which SiteMap calculates, we sorted 455 cocrystal complexes available from protein data bank into three groups and tested how Glide, a conventional docking program, and QPLD, a QM/MM docking program, perform on them. QPLD showed improvements on all three groups over Glide but with varying degrees. Analysis of the results was carried out, and establishment of correlations between the classification of binding sites and QM/MM docking performance was attempted. It was found that QM/MM docking delivers the most improvements for primarily hydrophobic binding sites with substantial hydrophilic interactions. Based on our findings, we make suggestions for use of QM/MM docking and directions for further developments.	attempt;binding sites;boat dock;cocrystal;docking (molecular);docking -molecular interaction;glide;ligand binding domain;molecular mechanics;protein data bank;qm/mm;quantum mechanics;site map	Jae Yoon Chung;Jung-Mi Hah;Art E.

c4924751933ab12927d97d0cc643a51b85b5e8d0	silk fabricator: using silkworms as 3d printers		Digital fabrication has evolved over time with the development of various methods such as three-dimensional (3D) printing and laser cutting. Three-dimensional printers are capable of easily producing output from complicated models designed in a computer. In addition, bio technologies are applying for fabrication [Yao et al. 2015]. How can 3D printers be made to output computationally-designed models of 3D sheets? Typically, the production of objects made of silk threads requires several steps (Figure 2): (1) silkworms form cocoons, (2) cocoons are made into threads, and (3) threads are transformed into clothes or other products. In the past, silkworms have been considered primarily as organisms that create silk threads, rather than as being capable of providing a method of silk production. Silk Pavillion [Oxman et al. 2014] was the first example where silkworms were regarded as providing a viable production method. However, this study only focused on making large but simple structures. In this study, we propose a new method to construct arbitrary three-dimensional silk sheets using silkworms (Figure 1). Our method can be applied to small objects printed with 3D printers. First, we print a 3D model in several parts to prevent silkworms from forming cocoons. When designing the model, we ensure that the silkworms have sufficient space to create silk sheets. Second, we print the portions of the model with a 3D printer. Third, we place silkworms on these portions, allowing them to spit silk threads. Finally, we peel off the produced sheets and connect them. This approach depends on the fact that when silkworms are placed on the surface of a three-dimensional object, they create silk sheets matched to the shape of the surface.	3d printing;british informatics olympiad;cascading style sheets;digital modeling and fabrication;polygonal modeling;printer (computing);silk road;yao graph	Riku Iwasaki;Yuta Sato;Ippei Suzuki;Atsushi Shinoda;Kenta Yamamoto;Kohei Ogawa;Yoichi Ochiai	2017		10.1145/3145690.3145704	engineering drawing;computer graphics (images);computer science;silk;thread (computing);laser cutting	Graphics	85.23895003014228	-23.814384675066414	30998

The method is discussed with a special focus on the strain induced breaking of crystal symmetry. It is demonstrated that under general stress the relative movement of the sublattices has a prominent effect on the conduction band masses. This displacement, which cannot be determined from macroscopic strain, is extracted from ab initio calculations. The transport properties of strained Si are investigated by solving the semi-classical Boltzmann equation using the Monte Carlo (MC) method. It is shown that the change of the electron effective mass induced by uniaxial stress has to be included in accurate models of the electron mobility. © 2007 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In sarcomere kinetics, the stochastic behavior of the myosin heads in the cooperative cross-bridge formation and the strain-dependent head rotations are directly simulated using a Monte Carlo (MC) method. This stochastic sarcomere model is coupled with contractile myofibril elements in a finite element (FE) cell assembly model. The cell assembly model is further coupled with a macroscopic FE heart model by means of the homogenization method. We bridge the large gap in the time step sizes between the MC and FE models with an idea based on impulse equilibrium between the sum of the stretches over the whole myosin arms and the contractile stress of the myofibril element.

This analysis allows us to give an estimation of global trends in evolution of ferromagnetic usage in the new generation of SHF (microwave) and EHF devices. The paper accentuates the thin-film ferromagnetic media where the properties are set on nanolevel. These properties enable us to manage ferrostructures parameters and to apply the structures to resonant circuits for nonlinear parametric zonal systems (NPS), which are operating within current ultraharmonics in higher instability zones of electromagnetic oscillations. It is concluded that intense interest for the problem of realization of resonant structures based on NPS, operating on current ultraharmonics in higher instability zones of electromagnetic oscillations in SHF and EHF bands, lies within nanomaterials with several order parameters, especially multiferroics and carbon nanotubes.	amiga hunk;instability;microwave;nonlinear system	Dmitry A.

bf6ed30d21709a36bee58160978fbbe681edd672	computer simulations for the structure and dynamics of large molecules, clusters and solids	computer simulation	Molecular Dynamics computer simulation is used to demonstrate the behaviour of surfaces upon impact by energetic molecules. At low energies and glancing angles the fullerene molecules can be made to scatter from the surface intact. The coupling of the deposited energy into the surface vibrational modes, particularly for layered materials like HOPG graphite, can lead to what appears to be anomalous behaviour. This is explored and compared with experimental results. Not all fullerene molecules are spherical. The C76 fullerene is elliptical in shape. Computer simulations are used to investigate the effects of shape on the scattering of molecules from a graphite surface. Molecular species have been used in ion implantation for doping shallow layers in silicon. There are two contradictory things that can happen when a cluster or molecule is implanted. The molecule will damage the crystal structure with each impact and in so doing could prevent the channelling of the implanted ions, thereby reducing the over-all range of the implantation. It is also possible that the atoms in the “front” of the cluster/molecule will interact with the surface first, pushing aside the surface atoms so that the atoms of the cluster/molecule following behind might not interact with them so strongly and hence be able to penetrate the solid more deeply. This will result in a deeper implantation range profile. Simulations are compared between single atom and molecular species to investigate which of these mechanisms, if any is operating at low implantation energies. Two clearly observed vibrational modes are excited in a graphite surface by molecular impacts. It is shown that these vibrational modes can assist in the desorption of loosely bound adsorbates from the surface. At higher impact energies it is shown that the surface disruption caused by the impact can both aid and inhibit the desorption process depending upon the position and energy of the initial fullerene impact in relation to the position of the adsorbate. Some simple conclusions about the “desorbing power” of a fullerene impact as a function of energy are drawn.	computer simulation;crystal structure;denial-of-service attack;doping (semiconductor);experience;graphite;interaction;ion implantation;molecular dynamics;normal mode;out there	Gotthard Seifert;Thomas Heine;Olaf Knospe;Rüdiger Schmidt	1996		10.1007/3-540-61142-8_575	computer simulation;computer science	Robotics	89.52314026217074	-10.91862199471851	31781
8f2c3e06e8e95aa65d1f17f87ed431eac563e3a1	comments on “towards increasing speech recognition error rates “by h. bourlard, h. hermansky, and n. morgan	error rate;speech recognition	A method for polishing radially expandable surgical stents is disclosed where fluid abrasive media M flows over surfaces of the stent 10 causing the surfaces of the stent 10 to be polished and streamlined. The stent 10 is temporarily provided with cylindrical support ends 20, which are not radially expandable to support the stent 10 during the polishing process. An interior polishing fixture 100 is provided which has cylindrical chambers 135 therein adapted to receive a stent 10 therein. Fluid abrasive media M then flows into bores 108 in the fixture 100 leading to the cylindrical chambers 135 and adjacent the inner diameter surfaces of the stent 10. Surfaces of the stent 10 forming the outer diameter are polished by placing the stent 10 within an exterior polishing fixture 200 which has a cylindrical recess 220 therein. The cylindrical recess 220 has a diameter greater than a diameter of outer surfaces of the stent 10 and includes a cylindrical shaft 270 passing axially through the cylindrical recess 220 upon which the stent 10 is located. Slanted bores 208 pass through walls of the exterior polishing fixture 200 and into the cylindrical recess 220, directing the abrasive media M adjacent exterior surfaces of the stent 10 and causing polishing of the exterior surfaces of the stent 10. The direction of abrasive media M flow can be reversed to make streamlining of segments of the stent 10 occur in a symmetrical fashion. After polishing of the stent 10 is completed, the cylindrical support ends 20 are removed and the stent 10 is ready for implantation and radial expansion within a body lumen L. When polished and streamlined, the radially expandable surgical stent 10 more effectively supports a body lumen L without excessive thrombus, restenosis and other medical complications.

Then, we convert the two-atom singlet state into a three-atom singlet state in three coupled bimodal cavities with the same principle. We also discuss the influence of decoherence induced by cavity decay and atomic spontaneous emission by numerical calculation. This scheme is robust against both the cavity decay and atomic spontaneous emission since there are no excited cavity fields involved during the operation process, and the atoms are only virtually excited. Actually, if multi-level atoms and multi-mode cavities are applicable, we can convert the ($$n-1$$n-1)-atom ($$n\ge 3$$n?3) singlet state into a $$n$$n-atom singlet state in coupled cavity arrays with the same principle in theory.	noon state;singlet state	Ye-Hong Chen;Yan Xia;Jie Song	2014	Quantum Information Processing	10.1007/s11128-014-0772-4	atomic physics;singlet fission;singlet state;triplet state;condensed matter physics;physics;quantum mechanics	Theory	89.08856238587612	-0.1935264675655609	31916

This contribution is offered as a step in that direction and presents two case studies with reference to modeling the complex physical and biological plugging/clogging phenomena in trickle-bed reactors/bioreactors, induced, respectively, by the retention of fine particles and by the formation of an excessive amount of biomass. The complex gas–liquid flow and space–time evolution of fines/bacterial cells capture, aggregation, detachment and migration in trickle-bed reactors/bioreactors were analyzed after a mathematical description was cast in terms of Euler–Euler two-fluid dynamic models based on the volume-average mass and momentum equations developed for multiphase systems coupled with species balance equations, solid deposit/biomass dynamics equations, filtration equations for the fines/bacterial cells and the aggregates, population balance equations for the fines/bacterial cells agglomeration.	multiscale modeling;tree accumulation	Ion Iliuta;Faïçal Larachi	2013	Computers & Mathematics with Applications	10.1016/j.camwa.2013.01.010	mathematical model;mathematics;statistics	Vision	92.00232836515104	-2.8541022904335542	31977

However the poor formability of these steels limits their applicatio n for many parts in the car body. A solution to thi s limitation can be a local heat treatment using a la ser beam to soften the material where a high formability is needed. Laser treatment was performe d using a Nd:YAG laser with 3 kW maximum power. The output power was temperature controlled to achieve a constant temperature level during the heat treatment. Large areas were treated by sca nning the surface with the laser beam. The materials under investigation are dual phase (DP), retained austenite (RA) and martensitic (MS) steels with a tensile strength of 600-1200 MPa. The thickness of the sheets was 1.5 mm. Depending on material and process parameters tempering of mar tensite, formation of ferrite and transformation of retained austenite are observed as a result of t he heat treatment. The changes in microstructure are accompanied by a reduction in yield and tensile strength. Deep drawing of a mock-up geometry reveal a reduction in slide force.	ferrite (magnet);linear algebra;maximum power transfer theorem;mock object;retained mode;thickness (graph theory);traffic collision avoidance system	Reimund Neugebauer;Sören Scheffler;Reinhart Poprawe;Andreas Weisheit	2009	Production Engineering	10.1007/s11740-009-0186-9	yield;microstructure;engineering;automotive industry;tensile testing;heat treating;scheduling;volume fraction;forensic engineering;ultimate tensile strength;initial value problem;metallurgy	HCI	86.06280882861321	-13.542972546334788	32215

Three different potentials of mean force for an isolated dipeptide were individually obtained by the multicanonical molecular dynamics simulations using the conventional force fields, AMBER parm94, AMBER parm96, and CHARMm22. Each potential of mean force was then calibrated based upon the umbrella sampling algorithm from the adiabatic energy map that was calculated separately by the ab initio molecular orbital method, and all of the calibrated potentials of mean force coincided well. The calibration method was also applied to the simulations of a peptide dimer in explicit water models, and it was shown that the calibrated free energy landscapes did not depend on the force field used in the classical simulations, as far as the conformational space was sampled well. The current calibration method fuses the classical free energy calculation with the quantum chemical calculation, and it should generally make simulations for biomolecular systems much more reliable when combining with enhanced conformational sampling.	ab initio quantum chemistry methods;algorithm;assisted model building with energy refinement (amber);charmm;calibration;dipeptides;domino tiling;force field (chemistry);molecular dynamics;molecular orbital;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;simulation;umbrella sampling;water model;emotional dependency;free energy	Satoshi Ono;Masataka Kuroda;Junichi Higo;Nobuyuki Nakajima;Haruki Nakamura	2002	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.10032	chemistry;force field;computational chemistry;physical chemistry;potential of mean force;quantum chemistry;physics;quantum mechanics	HPC	96.59688144815404	-5.098477498092373	32225
4601d1d93554c1b0c580973e38215d305d482dea	single-cell-trapping microarrays with high trapping efficiency and negligible shear stress		In this study, two novel hydrodynamics-based radial microarrays are proposed to trap single cells with high trapping efficiency and negligible shear stress. Both microarrays are designed based on a single cell trapping microdevice we designed using a combination of the stagnation point flow and the boundary effect. For each microarray, the efficiency of trapping is evaluated with the flow velocity distribution in the microfluidic channel through two models: an initial model calculates the velocity distribution without cell trapping; in the contrary, a trapping model estimates the velocity distribution when a cell is trapped at the stagnation point. In both models, the flow velocity distribution is obtained using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package ANSYS 16.0. We conclude that both microarrays can capture single cells with high trapping success rate and negligible shear stress, which would be effective experimental platforms to study single cell behaviors in response to extracellular stimuli.	approximation;computational fluid dynamics;dna microarray;futures studies;radial (radio);radial basis function;simulation;velocity (software development)	Miao Yu;Cheng Xiang;Jin-Yu Shao;Kai-Rong Qin	2018	2018 IEEE 14th International Conference on Control and Automation (ICCA)	10.1109/ICCA.2018.8444175	microfluidics;dna microarray;control theory;analytical chemistry;microarray;computational fluid dynamics;stagnation point;engineering;stagnation point flow;flow velocity;shear stress	Visualization	94.22783185651785	-7.184559985731115	32242

This paper presents an optically coupled system with the potential to quantitatively measure the RF currents induced on these conductors. The system uses a self shielded toroid transducer and active circuitry to modulate a high speed light-emitting-diode transmitter. Plastic fiber guides the light to a photodiode receiver and transimpedance amplifier. System validation included a series of experiments with bare wires that compared wire tip heating by fluoroptic thermometers with the RF current sensor response. Validations were performed on a custom whole body 64 MHz birdcage test platform and on a 1.5 T MRI scanner. With this system, a variety of phenomena were demonstrated including cable trap current attenuation, lossy dielectric Q-spoiling and even transverse electromagnetic wave node patterns. This system should find applications in studies of MRI RF safety for interventional devices such as pacemaker leads, and guidewires. In particular, variations of this device could potentially act as a realtime safety monitor during MRI guided interventions.	artificial cardiac pacemaker;diode device component;electromagnetic radiation;electromagnetics;electronic circuit;experiment;heating;high-frequency ventilation;lossy compression;magnetic resonance imaging;megahertz;node - plant part;rf modulator;radio frequency;scanner device component;thermometer, device;tissue fiber;transducer;transimpedance amplifier;transmitter device component;transverse wave	Marta G.

This work examines the hydrodynamics of these liquid films using the CFD solver, OpenFOAM to solve two-phase, isothermal, non-reacting flow using the volume-of-fluid (VOF) method. Local adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is used to ensure improved resolution of the geometrical grids at the gas-liquid interface. Comparisons are made between the solutions obtained using AMR and those obtained using highly refined static meshes.

The laminar sheath gas restricts the whipping motion of charged jet as well as decreases the required voltage. With the help of stretch force stems from sheath gas, the initiation voltage and sustaining voltage of EDW can be decreased obviously; the average diameter of micro/nano structure can be decreased from 21.58μm to 505.58nm. Different patterns can be also obtained by adjusting the moving speed of the collector in a sheath gas cases.

The methodology is implemented in FLAC3D, a lagrangian finite difference code designed for simulation of coupled deformation, fluid flow and heat transport in porous media. The rate of metamorphic fluid production is governed by the rate of temperature change and an approximation of the variation in bound water content of appropriate lithologies with temperature. Magmatic fluid production is governed by the rate of cooling and the variation in free water content of a mafic granitic magma with temperature. Changes in porosity and fluid pressure due to fluid production, deformation, and thermal expansion are taken into account. Dilation associated with thermal expansion and fluid production leads to rotation of the principal stresses around fluid source regions. Fluid properties are calculated using an equation of state for pure water. The methodology has been applied to examples representing aspects of Archaean gold mineralisation in Western Australia, providing insight into the role of magmatic and metamorphic fluids in mineralisation, and effects arising from interactions between deformation, heat transport and fluid production. & 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

2def9d7397dec33d6d6d17c1949a1ba30492ffd3	determination of kinetic and equilibrium parameters of chromium adsorption from water with carbon nanotube using genetic programming		ABSTRACTIn this paper Genetic Programming (GP) method was used to predict the removal of hexavalent chromium as one of main pollutant of wastewater using nanotube carbon as the adsorbent. One set of experimental data was chosen for this aim. The considered parameters as input of the network were adsorbent dosage, initial solution pH, initial concentration of Cr(VI), contact time and temperature and the output parameter of the network was final concentration of Cr(VI). GP applied for two groups of data, namely, kinetic and equilibrium and two correlations presented for these groups. The determined correlations using the GP had excellent precision.

The conforming section comprises opposed beam members configured to accommodate a considerably larger hole tolerance yet still provide sufficient retention force to stabilize the pin during a soldering process that such substrates may typically undergo. The beam cross-sections are configured to allow them to occupy a side-by-side position. Contact members with the conforming section can be manufactured by a wire-forming process in which end-to-end connected pins are formed as a continuous strip needing no excess material for carrying the pins, nor are any air gaps formed between the pins, and thus the finished continuous strip of pins can be wound up on a reel.	genetic algorithm;image processing;wavelet transform	Artem Belousov;Vladimir Spitsyn;Dmitry Sidorov	2009			wavelet;image processing;wavelet transform;air gap (plumbing);beam (structure);second-generation wavelet transform;soldering;computer science;top-hat transform;mechanical engineering	Robotics	85.49255547326662	-18.310800794726866	32637

To evaluate the underlying sensor mechanism, the unknown influence of the reference atmosphere on the NO sensing behavior is investigated in this study. Besides answering questions with respect to the underlying principle, this investigation can resolve the main question of whether a simplified sensor element without reference may be also suitable for NO sensing using the pulsed polarization measurement technique. With an adequate sensor setup, the reference atmosphere of the thimble type lambda probe is changed completely after a certain diffusion time. Thus, the sensor response regarding NO is compared with and without different gas atmospheres on both electrodes. It is shown that there is still a very good NO sensitivity even without reference air, although the NO response is reduced due to non-existing overlying mixed potential type voltage, which is otherwise caused by different atmospheres on both electrodes. Considering these results, we see an opportunity to simplify the standard NOx sensor design by omitting the reference electrode.	polarization (waves)	Sabine Fischer;Daniela Schönauer-Kamin;Roland Pohle;Maximilian Fleischer;Ralf Moos	2013		10.3390/s131216051	chemistry;telecommunications;bioinformatics;engineering;electrical engineering;yttria-stabilized zirconia;nanotechnology;optics;physics	HCI	93.13436793620832	-18.59129109733974	32662

These interactions are modified by cross-linking actin-binding proteins. This problem was raised first by Civelekoglu and Edelstein-Keshet [Bull. Math. Biol., 56 (1994), pp. 587–616]. When restricted to a two-dimensional configuration, the mathematical model consists of a single Boltzmann-like integrodifferential equation for the one-dimensional angular distribution. Linear stability analysis, asymptotic analysis, and numerical results reveal that at certain parameter values of actin-actin interactions, spontaneous alignment of filaments in the form of unipolar or bipolar bundles or orthogonal networks can be expected.	angularjs;apollonian network;interaction;mathematical model;numerical analysis;self-organization;spontaneous order	Alex Mogilner;Edith Geigant;Karina Ladizhansky	1998	SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics	10.1137/S0036139996309539	iterative reconstruction;integro-differential equation;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;self-organization;boltzmann equation;actin-binding protein;inverse problem;mathematical model;mathematics;optics;master equation;physics;quantum mechanics;statistics;photon diffusion	Comp.	88.45837008987398	3.0686571336544692	32779

These problems mainly deal with the proper representation of physical processes and arise when dealing with very shallow flow, temporary submergence and time-dependent flow domains, and complex morphology, and are often related to inaccuracies in modeling the geometry of the domain. Among others, wetting and drying of salt marshes and tidal flats, inclusion of the small scale drainage networks which often strongly affect hydrodynamics, turbulence closure schemes, and accurate friction evaluation are discussed in this paper. To better illustrate these problems and their possible solutions some examples are presented which use the Venice lagoon as a benchmark shallow tidal basin characterized by a complex interplay of channels and marshes. r 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The dielectric measurement mainly concerned the capacitance and loss of specimen as a function of frequency and temperature between −10 and 50 °C in different measuring environments (vacuum, ambient air with and without dryer). A broad peak of capacitance and loss due to the moisture absorption, depending on frequency and temperature rate and corresponding to a dynamic process involving water absorption and de-absorption, was observed in the heating run when the measurement was carried out in ambient air without dryer. It showed that water absorption would change the apparent dielectric properties of devices and a heat treatment at 50 °C for the BaTiO 3 -based devices was suggested to reduce the moisture absorption effect.

As a flexible display, a Luminous Array Film (LAFi) with the plasma tube is the world first film type display that realizes a bendable super large area emissive display. Using LAFi, several unique display applications with life size image and a curved display are realized. For holography application, we designed and fabricated ten-pixel array Spin-SLM with a fine pitch of 1 μm, that enables the large viewing-zone-angle of reproduced images, which no conventional SLMs can achieve. Although the number of pixel is not sufficient for reproducing holography images, diffracted light from the SLM was modulated by applying magnetic field. In summary, we have verified that Spin-SLM technology can potentially display holographic images with wide viewing-zone angles.	flexible display;holography;itil;luminous studio;modulation;pixel;plasma active;plasma display;rollable display;spatial light modulator	Kenichi Aoshima;Kenji Machida;Daisuke Kato;Hidekazu Kinjou;Kiyoshi Kuga;Tomoyuki Mishina;Hiroshi Kikuchi;Naoki Shimidzu;Kakeru Wada;Takayuki Ishibashi;Kenji Awamoto;Hitoshi Hirakawa;Manabu Ishimoto;Tsutae Shinoda	2013	2013 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting	10.1109/IAS.2013.6682549	materials science;electronic engineering;volumetric display;optoelectronics;optics;holographic display	Visualization	95.99118949947305	-15.051741821322628	33128

A Chevron-shaped thermal actuator has been used to drive the proof mass, whereas parallel plate electrodes have been used for sensing the rotation induced Coriolis force. The proposed model consists of three coupled proof masses that are driven together using a frame. To achieve larger bandwidth and increased sensitivity, the microgyroscope is operated with a slight mismatch in the resonant frequencies of the drive and sense-mode. Modal analysis in IntelliSuite predicted the drive and sense-mode resonant frequency at 5.37 and 5.2 kHz, respectively. A brief theoretical description of the resonant microgyroscope and mechanical design considerations of the proposed model are also discussed. Prototype fabrication using MetalMUMPs has also been investigated in this study. Microsystem Analyzer MSA-400 has been used to test the prototype at atmospheric pressure. The resonant frequency of the fabricated device is measured to be 5.98 kHz for the sense-mode. A drive displacement of 4.2 mm peak-to-peak is achieved by the proof mass when the device is operated at 1.3 Vac applied at 2.99 kHz consuming a power of 0.36 W. The proposed device has a size of 1.8 2.0 mm. The large voltage–stroke ratio and low damping of chevron-shaped thermal actuator compared to traditional comb drive may result in a high quality factor microgyroscope operating at atmospheric pressure. & 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

6f51c69fe6ea2283a24db31e48862c9535bc65fe	a multiple time step algorithm compatible with a large number of distance classes and an arbitrary distance dependence of the time step size for the fast evaluation of nonbonded interactions in molecular simulations	molecular simulation;nonbonded pair list;molecular dynamics;multiple time step algorithm;computer simulation;nonbonded interactions	A new algorithm is introduced to perform the multiple time step integration of the equations of motion for a molecular system, based on the splitting of the nonbonded interactions into a series of distance classes. The interactions between particle pairs in successive classes are updated at a progressively decreasing frequency. Unlike previous multiple time-stepping schemes relying on distance classes, the present algorithm sorts interacting particle pairs by their next update times rather than by their update frequencies. For this reason, the proposed scheme is extremely flexible with respect to the number of classes that can be employed (up to hundred or more) and the distance dependence of the relative time step size (arbitrary integer function of the distance). It can also easily be adapted to classes defined based on a criterion other than the interparticle distance (e.g., interaction magnitude). Different variants of the algorithm are tested in terms of accuracy and efficiency for simulations of a pure water system (6167 molecules) under truncated-octahedral periodic boundary conditions, and compared to the twin-range method standardly used with GROMOS96 (short- and long-range cutoff distances of 0.8 and 1.4 nm, pair list and intermediate-range interactions updated every five steps). In particular, multiple time-stepping schemes with an accuracy comparable to that of the twin-range method can be designed, that permit to increase the effective (long-range) cutoff distance from 1.4 to 3.0 nm with a performance loss of only about a factor 2. This result is quite encouraging, considering the benefits of doubling the cutoff radius in the context of (bio-)molecular simulations.		Vincent Kräutler;Philippe H.

9a8239bad392fb5022a24ac3f488f166fae60e9d	gec film with high substitutional carbon concentration formed by ion implantation and solid phase epitaxy for strained ge n-mosfets		Dear editor, Ge is considered as a promising channel material to replace Si because of its high carrier mobility than Si and compatibility with conventional Si process [1–3]. Strain engineering has been widely used in Si-based devices and can also be adopted in Ge-based devices to extend scaling limits and further improve device performance. It has been reported that electron and hole mobility of Ge are boosted by compressive and tensile strain, respectively [4]. Although strained Ge p-MOSFETs have been experimentally demonstrated, there are few reports on strained Ge n-MOSFETs. In order to introduce tensile strain in the channel of Ge n-MOSFETs, embedded source/drain (S/D) with smaller lattice constant than Ge as tensile stressors is an effective method. Among tensile stressor materials, GeC is a promising candidate due to its large lattice mismatch with Ge, which could induce high tensile strain in the channel. In spite of the advantages of GeC, there are still some challenges for the application of GeC into high performance devices, such as the low substitutional carbon concentration (Csub) in Ge. Firstly, the equilibrium solid solubility of C in Ge is extremely low (∼10 atoms/cm) [5]. Secondly, the Ge-C bond length (∼1.9 Å) is shorter than Ge-Ge bond (2.41 Å), which means large strain around substitutional C atoms in Ge [6]. The strain may be relieved by forming interstitial C atoms, which has been observed in Si [7]. In addition, subsequent thermal processes are likely to precipitate C atoms out from substitutional sites, resulting in the reduction of Csub [8]. So it is very important to improve Csub in GeC film. A simple and effective method of solid phase epitaxy (SPE) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated to improve Csub in GeC film by employing Ge and C implantation followed by rapid thermal annealing (RTA). The impact of SPE on Csub and re-crystallization of GeC film is investigated. The dependence of Csub and recrystallization on annealing temperature and time is also demonstrated. Finally, the possible mechanism is discussed. Experiment. The n-type Ge (100) substrates were used as the starting wafers. After cleaned by diluted hydrochloric acid (HCl), Ge preamorphous implantation (PAI) of 40 keV, 1× 10 cm and C implantation of 7 keV, 5× 10 cm were performed. The wafer with only C implantation was set as control sample. Finally, RTA was performed in nitrogen ambient to realize the solid phase epitaxial regrowth of GeC at the temperature of 400C–600C with the time of 60–600 s. Results and discussion.

Its performance is tested on the ionization potential and the energy gap between singlet ground state and lowest triplet for linear molecular hydrogen chains and more realistic systems, such as polyenes and polysilenes, using full configuration interaction (FCI) wave functions with a minimal basis set. The influence of different block sizes and the extent of interblock interactions are investigated. It has been demonstrated that satisfactory results can be obtained if the near degeneracies between the model space and the outer space are avoided and if interactions between the next-nearest neighbor blocks are considered. The method can be used with larger basis sets and other accurate enough ab initio evaluations (instead of FCI) of local excited states, from blocks, or from dimers or trimers of blocks. It provides a new possibility to accurately and economically describe the low-lying delocalized excited states of large systems, even inhomogeneous ones.	ab initio quantum chemistry methods;basis set (chemistry);degenerate energy levels;evaluation;excited state;full configuration interaction;ground state;hydrogen;large;polyenes;rev;singlet state;telling untruths;triplet state	Hongjiang Zhang;Jean-Paul Malrieu;Haibo Ma;Jing Ma	2012	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.21941	atomic physics;chemistry;ionization energy;computational chemistry;condensed matter physics;physics;quantum mechanics	Comp.	97.36252937902874	-5.069837733850786	33361
4950f26d2a575b77283bebac3c24ed955eec0159	an acoustic based approach for mitigating sewer system overflows	pipeline monitoring;acoustics;sewer pipes;signal attenuation;condition assessment	Sewer piping networks are prone to damage due to aging, natural disasters, excessive traffic and chemical reactions with the contaminants and the soil. The released effluents from sewer system overflows (SSOs) can contaminate the water reservoirs, cause property damage and pose public health hazard. The SSOs are caused by blockages, breaks due to structural weaknesses and other pipe defects. To mitigate SSOs by effectively deploying cleaning resources, periodic condition assessment is important. Traditionally, a remotely controlled robot with a closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera is used to assess the condition of sewer pipes. This method, however, is expensive, man-hour intensive and the robot mobility depends on extent of blockage. Acoustics based pipeline monitoring systems are, therefore, augmenting traditional robot based methods. Acoustic pressure signals in pipes suffer attenuation due to blockages. The signal attenuation can be used as a good indicator of the extent of blockage in a pipe. This paper proposes an approach that models the pipe section between two manholes as lossy acoustic waveguide. The analytical results from the proposed model are compared with those from field measurements and laboratory tests. The findings can be used in the development of acoustic based pipeline condition monitoring applications.	acoustic cryptanalysis;closed-circuit television;experiment;lossy compression;pipeline (unix);plasma cleaning;remote control;robot	Muhammad Safeer Khan	2016	2016 IEEE Global Humanitarian Technology Conference (GHTC)	10.1109/GHTC.2016.7857367	environmental engineering;engineering;geotechnical engineering;forensic engineering	Robotics	90.661164017863	-21.661491096500665	33411

The investigation of various SDs fabricated with different types of interfacial layer is important for understanding the electrical and dielectric properties of SDs. Therefore, in this study polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) film was used as an interfacial layer between metal and semiconductor. The electrical and dielectric properties of Au/PVA (Ni, Zn-doped)/n-Si SDs were calculated from the capacitance–voltage ( C – V ) and conductance–voltage ( G/w – V ) measurements. The effects of interface state density ( N ss  ) and series resistance ( R s  ) on  C – V  characteristics were investigated in the wide temperature range. It was found that both of the  C – V – T  and  G/w – V – T  curves included two abnormal regions and one intersection point. The dielectric constant ( e ″), dielectric loss ( e ″), dielectric loss tangent (tan  δ ) and the ac electrical conductivity ( σ ac  ) obtained from the measured capacitance and conductance were studied for Au/PVA (Ni, Zn-doped)/n-Si SDs. Experimental results show that the values of  e ′,  e ″ and tan  δ  are a strong function of the temperature. Also, the results indicate the interfacial polarization can be more easily occurred at high temperatures.	diode;schottky barrier	Ilbilge Dökme;S. Altindal;T. Tunç;I.

The first formulation is useful to determine the number of bubbles of an object, while the second one can be used to calculate the number of tunnels of an object.

The surface temperature is assumed to vary as a power of the axial coordinate measured from the leading edge of the plate. A nonsimilar mixed convection parameter @x and a pseudo-similarity variable @h are introduced to cast the governing boundary layer equations into a system of dimensionless equations which are solved numerically using finite difference method. The mixed convection parameter is chosen to cover the entire regime of mixed convection from the pure forced convection limit to the pure free convection limit. The effect of material parameter, the exponent for the power-law variation in wall temperature and the nonsimilar mixed convection parameter are considered. The micropolar fluids are observed to display drag reduction and reduce surface heat transfer rate when compared to Newtonian fluid. The effect of the buoyancy force results in the enhancements of friction factor, heat transfer rate and wall couple stress. The local heat transfer rate is found to increase with increase in the exponent value of the power-low variation in wall temperature.		F. S. Ibrahim;I. A.

952443697c7421e01ae40b25bace7478403df67f	mixed boundary-value analysis of rocking vibrations of an elastic strip foundation on elastic soil with saturated substrata		The dynamic response of an elastic strip foundation lying on elastic soil with saturated substrata is greatly affected by pore pressure induced by a rocking moment. In this paper, we explore the mixed boundary-value problem of the rocking vibration of an elastic strip foundation on elastic soil with saturated substrata via Biot dynamic equations. First, the wave equations concerning both the single-phase elastic layer and the saturated half-space are solved using a Fourier integral transform technique. The dual integral equations of the rocking vibration of an elastic strip foundation are established according to themixed boundary conditions. Finally, the relationship of the dynamic compliance coefficient with the dimensionless frequency is obtained by applying Simpson’s rule to conduct numerical calculation. We also analyse the influences of the elastic layer’s thickness and elastic characteristic parameters of the foundation on the rocking vibration.	amazon elastic block store;amazon elastic compute cloud (ec2);boundary-value analysis;coefficient;elastic net regularization;numerical analysis;simpson's rule;thickness (graph theory);time-scale calculus	Xiaohua Ma;Zhenyu Wang;Yuanqiang Cai;Changjie Xu	2013	J.

For the molecules of small molecular size, comparison was carried out with the results of ab ini t io calculations. Heats of formation were also obtained from molecular mechanics for hydroperoxides and peroxides: The values are, in general, overestimated. For the molecules containing the CF, group, the calculated values are subject to large errors and heats of formation were obtained from ab ini t io total energies in the “atom equivalents” scheme. To estimate the homolyhc dissociation energies of the different bonds in the peroxide molecules, heats of formation of R. , .OR, and .OOR radicals were employed and several of them had to be calculated. Different approaches were employed-molecular mechanics calculations, ab ini t io energies within the atom equivalent and isodesmic reaction schemes, and Benson’s group additivity rule; values consistent within the different calculation methods were chosen for estimating dissociation energies. The bond dissociation energies indicate different trends in these molecules as a function of the nature of the R and R‘ groups and the possible electronic effects operating in these molecules are discussed.	isodesmic reaction;molecular mechanics	Rois Benassi;Ugo Folli;Silvia Sbardellati;Ferdinando Taddei	1993	Journal of Computational Chemistry	10.1002/jcc.540140402	stereochemistry;steric effects;energy;chemistry;molecular mechanics;inversion barrier;standard enthalpy of formation;organic chemistry;computational chemistry;bond-dissociation energy;physics;quantum mechanics	ML	96.23655333560721	-5.4814256330807005	33777

Two and three dimensional close-packed droplet lattices were obtained in microfluidic devices by adjusting the channel geometry, the fluidic flow rates and the monodispersed droplet size. The droplet packing was mainly caused by the volumetric effect and capillarity in confined microchannels. Polymerizable fluids were also investigated to demonstrate the effect of fluidic properties on the microdroplet generation and assembly, which could find interesting applications in the future.

Multi-channel transmit arrays, driven in parallel, have been developed to increase the transmit field (B1+) uniformity in this wavelength regime. However, the closely packed array elements interact through mutual coupling. This paper expands on the ability of a distributed planar filter (the “magnetic wall”) to decouple individual elements in an entire array. A transmit RF coil suitable for neuroimaging at 7T was constructed. The transmit coil, composed of 10 individual surface coil elements, was decoupled with magnetic walls. A separate receive coil array was used for signal reception. The hardware and imaging performance of the transmit coil was validated with electromagnetic simulation, bench-top measurements, and in vivo MRI experiments. Analysis and measurements confirmed that the magnetic wall decoupling method provides high isolation between transmit channels, while minimally affecting the B1+ field profiles. Electromagnetic simulations confirmed that the decoupling method did not correlate to local specific absorption rate (SAR) “hot spots” or increase local-to-global SAR fractions in comparison to previously reported 7T multi-channel transmit arrays employing different decoupling methods.	characteristic impedance;circuit complexity;coil device component;coupling (computer programming);data structure alignment;dental inlays;electromagnetic spectrum;electronic filter;exanthema;experiment;high-frequency ventilation;input impedance;large;magnetic fields;magnetic resonance imaging;microwave;muckle-wells syndrome;neuroimaging;numerous;polychlorinated biphenyls;preamplifier;printed circuit board;quantitative impedance;radio frequency;simulation;single linkage cluster analysis;tracing (software);video-in video-out;walls of a building;benefit;wavelength	Ian R.

Paper-based sensors provide affordable platforms for simple, accurate, and rapid detection of diseases, in addition to monitoring food quality, environmental and sun exposure, and detection of pathogens. Paper-based devices provide an inexpensive technology for fabrication of simple and portable diagnostic systems that can be immensely useful in resource-limited settings, such as in developing countries or austere environments, where fully-equipped facilities and highly trained medical staff are absent. In this work, we present the different types of paper that are currently utilized in fabrication of paper-based sensors, and common fabrication techniques ranging from wax printing to origami- and kirigami-based approaches. In addition, we present different detection techniques that are employed in paper-based sensors such as colorimetric, electrochemical, and fluorescence detection, chemiluminescence, and electrochemiluminescence, as well as their applications including disease diagnostics, cell cultures, monitoring sun exposure, and analysis of environmental reagents including pollutants. Furthermore, main advantages and disadvantages of different types of paper and future trends for paper-based sensors are discussed.	biosensors;cell culture techniques;chemiluminescence;electrochemiluminescence;fluorescence;printing;reagents;waxes;analyte;sensor (device)	Amrita Tribhuwan Singh;Darlin Lantigua;Gary John V Mercado;Swamy S;Manjot Pandher;Gulden Camci-Unal	2018		10.3390/s18092838	electronic engineering;engineering;systems engineering	HCI	95.15639492688456	-19.453104544772604	34193

First, solid acrylic-based polymeric films of 100 µm thickness were obtained via radical copolymerization process. Secondly, dithizone sensoring motifs were anchored in a simple five-step route, obtaining handleable colorimetric sensory films. To create the microporous structure, films were foamed in a ScCO₂ batch process, carried out at 350 bar and 60 °C, resulting in homogeneous morphologies with cell sizes around 5 µm. The comparative behavior of the solid and foamed sensory films was tested in the detection of mercury in pure water media at 2.2 pH, resulting in a reduction of the response time (RT) around 25% and limits of detection and quantification (LOD and LOQ) four times lower when using foamed films, due to the increase of the specific surface associated to the microcellular structure.

It is advantageous when used to obtain the 3D coordinates of the overall shape as well as any particular area or point of a target object. In addition, using TLS for the stress monitoring of structures will not require the installation of a sensor on the target structure whose structural response will be assessed. Thus, TLS can resolve the limitations of conventional sensors based on strain monitoring. This article presents a computational model for the automatic estimation of the stresses of beam structures using TLS in association with a finite element method. The method is experimentally applied to the stress estimation of a simply supported steel beam subjected to a concentrated load. In this experimentation, the maximum and minimum errors between the estimated stresses using TLS and directly measured stresses from electrical strain gages are found to be 7.2% and 2.2%, respectively.	computational model;experiment;finite element method;maxima and minima;sensor;terrestrial television	H.

Their type and value depend on the workpiece and tool material properties, cutting parameters and cooling and lubrication conditions in the tool-chip-machined surface interface. As the effects of material properties and cutting parameters have been widely studied, the influence of cooling and lubrication conditions, especially minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) on the surface layer residual stresses and the relationships between them have not been investigated. In this paper the effects of dry, MQL cutting and cutting with emulsion conditions together with cutting parameters on residual stresses after turning AISI 316L steel were investigated. X-ray diffraction method was used for measuring superficial residual stresses in the cutting (hoop) and feed (axial) directions. Tensile residual stresses were detected in both directions and the values in the cutting direction turned out to be higher than in the feed direction. The effects of cooling and lubrication conditions largely depend on the selected cutting parameters, whose influence is linked to the cutting zone cooling and lubrication mode. Elaborated regression functions allow calculation and optimization of residual stresses in turning AISI 316L steel, depending on cooling and lubrication conditions as well as cutting parameters.

We limit our approach to very basic principles in terms of behavior, to focus on the particular problems raised by the non-smooth character of the models. We consider that individuals tend to move according to a desired, or spontanous, velocity. We account for congestion by assuming that the evolution realizes at each time an instantaneous balance between individual tendencies and global constraints (overlapping is forbidden): the actual velocity is defined as the closest to the desired velocity among all admissible ones, in a least square sense. We develop those principles in the microscopic and macroscopic settings, and we present how the framework of Wasserstein distance between measures allows to recover the sweeping process nature of the problem on the macroscopic level, which makes it possible to obtain existence results in spite of the non-smooth character of the evolution process. Micro and macro approaches are compared, and we investigate the similarities together with deep differences of those two levels of description.	instantaneous phase;network congestion;velocity (software development)	Bertrand Maury;Aude Roudneff-Chupin;Filippo Santambrogio;Juliette Venel	2011	NHM	10.3934/nhm.2011.6.485	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;numerical analysis;mathematics;geometry;least squares	Vision	83.73417470581421	1.5949760351852853	34847

ATP can be assembled onto the surface of AuNPs through interaction between the electron-rich nitrogen atoms and the electron-deficient surface of AuNPs. Accordingly, Cu2+ ions induce a change in the color and UV/Vis absorbance of AuNPs by coordinating to the triphosphate groups and a ring nitrogen of ATP. A detection limit of 50 nM was achieved, which is comparable to or lower than that achievable by the currently used electrochemical, spectroscopic or chromatographic methods. The theoretical simplicity and high selectivity reported herein demonstrated that AuNPs-based colorimetric assay could be applied in a wide variety of fields by rationally designing the surface chemistry of AuNPs. In addition, our results indicate that ATP-modified AuNPs are less stable in Cu2+, Cd2+ or Zn2+-containing solutions due to the formation of the corresponding dimeric metal-ATP complexes.	adenosine triphosphate;automated theorem proving;electron;ions;microsoft outlook for mac;selectivity (electronic);solutions;cupric cation;zinc cation	Dehua Deng;Ning Xia;Sujuan Li;Chunying Xu;Ting Sun;Huan Pang;Lin Liu	2012		10.3390/s121115078	gold;chemistry;colorimetry;detection limit;colorimetry;analytical chemistry;nanotechnology;inorganic chemistry;colloidal gold;metal ions in aqueous solution;molecular probe	Vision	96.03374497815908	-17.148123995078276	35070

Therefore, we develop a micro tattooing mechanism activated by multiple conical springs which can be installed in a capsule endoscope. In order to insert the needle and inject ink, a conical spring is released by cutting a post with Ni-Cr wire. Then, the needle is withdrawn by another conical spring activated by SMA wire. As a result, we could inject and withdraw the needle with electrical power consumption of 36.52 mWh.	wire wrap	Seonggun Joe;Dongkyu Lee;Byungjeon Kang;Jong-Oh Park;Byungkyu Kim	2017	2017 14th International Conference on Ubiquitous Robots and Ambient Intelligence (URAI)	10.1109/URAI.2017.7992836	biomedical engineering;conical surface;capsule;endoscope;engineering	Robotics	86.5274364666133	-20.309490503619546	35224
3329139cc14b2042e3563364d6926146f0db1df6	investigations of printed flexible ph sensing materials based on graphene platelets and submicron ruo2 powders		The paper describes the investigations of pH-sensitive materials for screen printed flexible pH sensors. The sensors were fully printed and consisted of three layers, conductive made of low temperature-curable silver paste, insulating made of UV-curable dielectric paste, and pH-sensitive made of developed graphene/ruthenium oxide pastes. Graphene and ruthenium oxide composites were prepared with different proportions of graphene nanoplatelets paste and submicron ruthenium dioxide. To perform functional measurements, particular testing sensors were fabricated on flexible polyester foil. Afterwards electrochemical potential measurements of fabricated devices were carried out. Sensors were also exposed to cyclic bending and the change of pH sensitivity before and after bending was described. Eventually, percolation threshold concerning the amount of ruthenium oxide in the pH-sensitive layer was designated and UV influence on the sensitivity was observed that together allow for optimization of sensors&#x2019; fabrication costs.	graphene	Daniel Janczak;Andrzej Peplowski;Grzegorz Wróblewski;Lukasz Górski;Elzbieta Zwierkowska;Malgorzata Jakubowska	2017	J.

1bc977d22c57dc2c36816d1f8eab3ac963905628	implementation of advanced signal processing techniques on line-scan thermography data		In the last few years, composite materials have found an important niche of application in several industries, mainly because of their improved mechanical properties (higher stiffness, strength and resistance to fatigue). In this context, sandwich-composites, a special class of composite materials - are commonly used in the aerospace industry to manufacture lighter components. The increasing use of this type of materials in the aerospace sector has opened the necessity of inspection methods to evaluate its physical integrity and quality. Line Scan Thermography (LST) is one of the emerging technologies aimed to detect and evaluate subsurface defects present in the sandwiches composite structures. As a non-destructive testing and evaluation (NDT&E) technique, LST is a dynamic technique suited to inspect large and complex aerospace components. However, its performance to detect deeper and smaller defects is negatively affected due to the different sources of noise present in the collected thermal images. In this paper is studied the application of advanced signal processing techniques on LST data obtained from the inspection of a large composite component, which contains different types of internal defects located at a variety of depths. To evaluate the ability of each technique to reduce the noise, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the maximum signal contrast of each defect has been computed for further analysis.	niche blogging;robotic materials;signal processing;signal-to-noise ratio;software bug;subsurface scattering	Fariba Khodayar;Fernando Lopez;Clemente Ibarra-Castanedo;Xavier Maldague	2017	2017 IEEE 30th Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)	10.1109/CCECE.2017.7946669	computer science;electronic engineering;signal processing;nondestructive testing;thermography;signal-to-noise ratio	SE	91.9311803784032	-19.154073673210565	35471

Application in molecular mechanics (MM) involves conformational equilibria in solution: rotational isomers of ethylene glycol (I), 1,2-difluoroethane (10, fluoroacetic acid (110, and representative conformers of macrocyclic receptors such as 18-crown-6 (IV), cryptand 2.2.2 (V), and t-butyl-calix[4]arenetetraamide (VI). Assessment of the MST-PC results is based on the comparison with ab initio reactive field calculations (for I-111), with the continuum model of Still (W. C. Still et al., J. Am. Chem. SOC., 1990, 112, 6127) (for I-VI), and with average solute-solvent interaction energies obtained from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with explicit solvent in water (I-VI) and in acetonitrile (IV-VI). It is demonstrated that the continuum solvent model qualitatively reproduces the trends in solvation energies in water. The few exceptions may be related to particular topological features of the solute. An improved discrete/continuum approach in which some first-shell solvent molecules are considered as a part of the solute embedded in the dielectric continuum provides more realistic results, as is *Author to wh,om all correspondence should be addressed.

Standards help define a susceptibility threshold of an IC to a single ESD zap. But during the lifetime of an IC, it will be stressed by multiple discharges. After electrical characterisation, series of low-level ESD stresses were applied to two commercially available integrated circuits using the human body model and the charged device model. It is shown that cumulative ESD stresses, even at a level below the failure one, significantly impact the IC lifetime by creating latent defects. In the next step, we localize the defect in failed devices with non destructive characterisation techniques such as EMMI, OBIRCH and OBIC to get a better understanding of the ESD phenomenon.

Its malfunction may result in serious diseases such as cancer, autoimmunity, and neurodegeneration. In apoptosis, tens of species are present in many biochemical reactions with times scales of widely differing orders of magnitude. According to the law of mass action, apoptosis is usually described with a large and stiff system of ODEs (ordinary differential equations). The goal of this work is to derive a simple system of ODEs by using the classical PEA (partial equilibrium approximation) method. For this purpose, we firstly justify the mathematical correctness of the PEA in a quite general framework. On the basis of this result, we simplify the Fas-signaling pathway model proposed by Hua et al. (2005) by assuming the fastness of several reversible reactions. Numerical simulations and sensitivity analysis show that our simplification model is reliable.	approximation;cell signaling;computer simulation;correctness (computer science);feedback arc set;gene regulatory network;homeostasis;international conference on systems biology;level of detail;mass action law (electronics);numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;simulation;stiff equation	Ya-Jing Huang;Wen-An Yong	2012	2012 IEEE 6th International Conference on Systems Biology (ISB)	10.1109/ISB.2012.6314124	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;apoptosis;calculus;control theory;mathematics;differential equation	Robotics	87.45814997236708	-1.078917777245699	35726

Such deltahedra include the capped pentagonal bipyramid for the 8-vertex system. Among such geometries the lowest energy structures have the carbon atoms at the lowest degree vertices (typically degree 4 vertices), no pairs of adjacent carbon atoms (i.e., no C-C edges), and the maximum number of Mo-C edges. Optimizing these factors favoring low-energy CpMoC3B(n-4)H(n-1) (n = 8, 9, 10, 11) structures leads to a unique lowest energy structure lying more than 10 kcal/mol below the next lowest energy structure for the 8-, 10-, and 11-vertex systems. However, the 9-vertex CpMoC3B5H8 system has three structures within 8 kcal/mol including a structure based on the closo tricapped trigonal prism rather than the isocloso 9-vertex deltahedron.

An array of metal oxide sensors was used for detecting volatile organic compounds. The measurement circuit employs a voltage divider resistor to measure the sensitivity of each sensor. This E-nose was controlled by in-house developed software through a portable USB data acquisition card with a principle component analysis (PCA) algorithm implemented for pattern recognition and classification. Because gas sensor sensitivity in the detection of armpit odor samples is affected by humidity, we propose a new method and algorithms combining hardware/software for the correction of the humidity noise. After the humidity correction, the E-nose showed the capability of detecting human body odor and distinguishing the body odors from two persons in a relative manner. The E-nose is still able to recognize people, even after application of deodorant. In conclusion, this is the first report of the application of an E-nose for armpit odor recognition.	axilla;data acquisition;deodorants;electronic nose;exposure to humidity;odors;organic chemicals;pattern recognition;principal component analysis;resistor device component;statistical classification;usb;volatile organic compounds;voltage divider;algorithm;metal oxide;sensor (device)	Chatchawal Wongchoosuk;Mario Lutz;Teerakiat Kerdcharoen	2009		10.3390/s90907234	electronic nose;computer science;bioinformatics;engineering;data mining;biological engineering	Vision	95.71258905817969	-19.12182872736013	35770

In TLM, parallelepipeds are used to discretize three-dimensional problems. The drawback in using parallelepiped shapes is that instead of refining only the domain of interest, a large additional domain would also have to be refined, which results in increased computational time and memory space. In this paper, we developed a tetrahedral node for TLM applied to bio-heat transfer that does not have the drawback associated with the parallelepiped node. The model includes heat source, blood perfusion, boundary conditions and initial conditions. The boundary conditions could be adiabatic, temperature, heat flux, or convection. The predicted temperature and heat flux were compared against results from an analytical solution and the results agreed within 2% for a mesh size of 69,941 nodes and a time step of 5ms. The method was further validated against published results of maximum skin-surface temperature difference in a breast with and without tumor and the results agreed within 6%. The published results were obtained from a model that used parallelepiped TLM node. An open source software, TLMBHT, was written using the theory developed herein and is available for download free-of-charge.	anatomic node;biological system;british informatics olympiad;computation;conflict (psychology);convection;dspace;discretization;download;flux;initial condition;neoplasms;node - plant part;numerical method;open-source software;scientific publication;time complexity;transmission line;transoral laser microsurgery;disease transmission;perfusion (blood)	Hugo Fernando Maia Milan;Kifle G.

To obtain such 4valued conductances, we propose FM1/spin-polarized barrier/FM2 junctions, where the FM1 and FM2 are different ferromagnets, and the barrier has spin dependence. The proposed idea is applied to the case of the barrier having localized spins. Assuming that all the localized spins are pinned parallel to magnetization axes of the FM1 and FM2, 4-valued conductances are explicitly obtained for the case of many localized spins. Furthermore, objectives for an ideal spin-polarized barrier are discussed.	electron;entity framework;fm broadcasting;gnu nano;ieee 802.1aq;magnetoresistive random-access memory	Satoshi Kokado;Kikuo Harigaya	2003	CoRR	10.1088/0953-8984/15/50/012	tunnel junction;chemistry;spin polarization;nuclear magnetic resonance;electrical resistivity and conductivity;condensed matter physics;physics;quantum mechanics;ferromagnetism	Robotics	93.77406000872315	-8.655744623485203	36063

Different immobilization techniques of monoclonal anti-E. coli were tested, in order to reach the very low limit of detections. The comparison between the immobilization procedures underlined the advantages of the oriented procedure and the use of a dendrimer, which allowed for immobilizing a higher number of antibody units, reaching a very high sensitivity. However, the use of activated ferrocene as electron-transferring mediator, which improved the electrical properties of the system, resulted in a very low limit of detection equal to 3 cfu/mL.

This research focuses on the development of numerical code to deal with incompressible two phase flow around 2D hydrofoil combined with cavitation model suggested by Kunz et al. with k-epsiv turbulent model. The simulation results are compared to experimental data to verify the validity of the developed code. Also, the comparison of the calculation results is made with LES results to evaluate the capability of conventional turbulence models such as k-epsiv model. The calculation results show very good agreement with experimental observations even though this code can not grasp the small scaled bubbles in the calculation whereas LES can hold the real physics. Also, the calculation of cavitation in cryogenic fluid was done by implementing the temperature sensitivity in government equations. Even though the results show good agreement with previous calculation results, further research will be needed to account for real physics of the formation of cavitation in cryogenic fluid due to temperature sensitivity. This code will be further extended to 3D compressible two phase flow for the study on the fluid dynamics around inducers and impellers in turbo pump system.	computer simulation;large eddy simulation;numerical analysis;turbulence modeling	Seyoung Lee;Changjin Lee;Soohyung Park	2007	2007 International Conference on Computational Science and its Applications (ICCSA 2007)	10.1109/ICCSA.2007.49	electric potential energy;mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;fast multipole method;computer science;floating point;electric field;theoretical computer science;affine arithmetic;mathematics;interval arithmetic;truncation error;computational complexity theory;algorithm	HPC	93.38715362722002	3.2584497148347316	36629
c6073e0af4e89c3a57d2e0956e9fc463713d3a6a	dynamic analysis of composite propeller of ship using fea		Ships and underwater vehicles use propeller for propulsion. In general, propellers are used as propulsors and they are also used to develop significant thrust to propel the vehicle at its operational speed and RPM. The blade geometry and design are more complex involving many controlling parameters. In current years the increased need for light weight structural element with composite materials has led to use of S2 glass fabric/epoxy to propeller. The present research work is to carry out the model and static analysis of aluminium, composite material which is a combination of glass fibre reinforced plastics (GFRP) materials. The research work deals with modelling and analysing the propeller blade of an underwater vehicle for their strength. A propeller is a complex geometry which requires high end modelling software. The solid model of propeller is developed in CATIA V5 R21.

Flow-based methods have been used to sort particles and cells. However, the main challenge with flow based particle separation systems is the need for a sheath flow for successful operation. Existence of the sheath liquid dilutes the analyte, necessitates precise flow control between sample and sheath flow, requires a complicated design to create sheath flow and separation efficiency depends on the sheath liquid composition. In this paper, we present a microfluidic platform for sheathless particle separation using standing surface acoustic waves. In this platform, particles are first lined up at the center of the channel without introducing any external sheath flow. The particles are then entered into the second stage where particles are driven towards the off-center pressure nodes for size based separation. The larger particles are exposed to more lateral displacement in the channel due to the acoustic force differences. Consequently, different-size particles are separated into multiple collection outlets. The prominent feature of the present microfluidic platform is that the device does not require the use of the sheath flow for positioning and aligning of particles. Instead, the sheathless flow focusing and separation are integrated within a single microfluidic device and accomplished simultaneously. In this paper, we demonstrated two different particle size-resolution separations; (1) 3 μm and 10 μm and (2) 3 μm and 5 μm. Also, the effects of the input power, the flow rate, and particle concentration on the separation efficiency were investigated. These technologies have potential to impact broadly various areas including the essential microfluidic components for lab-on-a-chip system and integrated biological and biomedical applications.	acoustic cryptanalysis;diameter (qualifier value);diastasis;displacement mapping;flow;large;lateral computing;lateral thinking;microchip analytical devices;microfluidics;particle size;particle filter;polystyrenes;psychologic displacement;stage level 2;analyte	Rasim Guldiken;Myeong Chan Jo;Nathan D.

Over the years, many different acceleration models have been proposed based on different physics. In this paper, a method for a relatively fast screen of various low-k TDDB models is proposed. Fast voltage ramp test to establish a relation of JE slope versus stress field is the first step. Study of J-E slopes in advance before time-consuming TDDB could provide insight into TDDB kinetics. Next is to select appropriate stress voltages based on J-E characteristics with high density voltage points but at high and medium stress voltage ranges. Lastly, by proceeding with the local acceleration factor comparison and correlating it to J-E slope versus voltage relation, the most likely and the most unlikely models can effectively be determined within a much shorter period of stress time.	back end of line;kinetics internet protocol;ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability;series and parallel circuits	Fen Chen;Carole Graas;Michael A.

Indeed, the creep model describes the behaviour of solder joints under thermal cycling quite properly. However, in applications such as hand held electronic devices or automotive products, the pure mechanical impact like shock, bending and twisting may even matter more than sole thermo-mechanical fatigue. Therefore the time-independent behaviour of SnPb37, SnAg3.5 and SnAg4Cu0.5 has been investigated on flip chip solder joints. In the experimental tests a cyclic triangular strain wave with constant frequency but different amplitudes was used as the load function. This way the test enables to account for Bauschinger effects. The strain wave amplitudes ranged from De 1⁄4 0:25% to 4%, the strain wave frequency was fixed at f 1⁄4 1 Hz. The test temperature ranged from T 1⁄4 5 to 50 C. The test specimen consisted of two silicon chips (3.3 · 3.3 mm) bonded by 4 flip chip joints (one at each corner). A specially designed Micro Shear Tester has been used for the experiments with this type of specimen. In contrast to similar setups, it is actively compensated for its finite stiffness. Therefore, it is able to record force–displacement hysteresis with a resolution of better than 1 mN and 20 nm, respectively. Based on these measurements, the parameters of the constitutive equations have been evaluated by FEM analysis. This way, the complex stress state within the sample during the test has been considered precisely providing for high accuracy of the parameter extracted. As a typical application, a three point bending experiment has been simulated by FEM applying different constitutive models for the solder material. Comparing the results, it becomes clear: All the three contributions, i.e., the elastic, the creep, and the time-independent plastic material behaviour, are required in the model. Otherwise it would be incomplete and hence insufficient for assisting in the design of today’s electronics packages even with respect to the most frequent load cases. 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

One phase is a high-resistance amorphous phase that is obtained by melting a small volume of glass using ohmic heating, and then quenching it. The second phase is a low-resistance crystalline phase that is obtained by heating the glass to just below the melting point to promote recrystallization. This paper describes two models for such a cell. The first is a very simple single-element, lumped model that exhibits correct phase transition behavior, but is unrealistic in its sensitivity to the heating current pulses. The second, multiple-element model is able to more realistically represent cell heating and cooling behavior, and appears to be the more suitable basis for an electrical simulation model.	computer cooling;glass;memory cell (binary);phase-change memory;scalability;simulation	Daniel Salamon;Bruce F.

In this new work, we studied the kinetic and/or analytical applicability of the KINMODEL(AGDC) program in a broad series of reactions of different complexities: (a) Simple reactions (reversible and irreversible), (b) Consecutive (reversible and irreversible), (c) Concurrent, (d) Competitive, (e) Cyclic. KINMODEL(AGDC) is a computational method that uses the AGDC mathematical optimization algorithm to determine different types of parameters. It is valid for the treatment of any reaction mechanism and allows the determination of different parameters from absorbance data. In all the reactions system included in the a, b, c, d and e groups, the KINMODEL(AGDC) methodology was applied for the determination of the initial concentrations of the species involved in the reaction mechanism, individually or jointly, with the kinetic constants of the elementary reactions comprising the mechanism. We analyze the influence of an extensive series of factors affecting the optimization process: the nature and number of the parameters to be optimized, the initial estimations of the parameters, the reaction mechanism and the relative values of the different rate constants of the mechanism considered. Since parameters of different natures and orders of magnitude are determined, we analyze the possibility of the existence of ambiguity in the solutions since it is common to find several (two or more) groups of parameters that fit the experimental kinetic data. 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This paper proposes an integration method of process parameters optimization using finite element method (FEM), Kriging metamodels and nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) in laser welding for stainless steel 316L. The process parameters in this study are laser power (LP), welding speed (WS) and laser focal position (LF). Firstly, a three-dimensional thermal finite element model is developed to obtain the simulated results of bead width (BW) and depth of penetration (DP). Then, Kriging metamodels are constructed to reflect the relationship between input process parameters and output responses. Finally, NSGA-II is used to search for multi-objective Pareto optimal solutions. In addition, the main effects and contribution rates of multiple process parameters on welding bead profile are analyzed. The results of verification experiments indicate that the optimal process parameters are effective and reliable for producing expected welding bead profile. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this method, ceramic slurry is injected into a 3-D polymeric mold via a centrifugal casting process. The polymeric master mold is thermally decomposed so that complex 3-D piezoelectric ceramic elements can be produced. To demonstrate the fabrication of 3-D piezoelectric ceramic elements, we produced a spiral piezoelectric element that can convert multidirectional loads into a voltage. We confirmed that a prototype of the spiral piezoelectric element could generate a voltage by applying a load in both parallel and lateral directions in relation to the helical axis. The power output of 123 pW was obtained by applying the maximum load of 2.8N at 2 Hz along the helical axis. In addition, to improve the performance of power generation, we utilized a two-step sintering process to obtain dense piezoelectric elements. As a result, we obtained a sintering body with relative density of 92.8 % that is higher than that of a conventional sintered body. Piezoelectric constant d31 of the sintered body attained to -40.0 pC/N that is better than that of a conventional sintered body. The 3-D ceramic molding process is capable to produce a highly efficient 3-D piezoelectric energy harvester that can scavenge multidirectional vibration energy to generate electrical energy by optimizing its 3-D shape.	3d computer graphics;apache axis;centrifugal governor;industrial robot;lateral thinking;maximum power transfer theorem;piezoelectricity;polymer;prototype;rapid prototyping;wearable technology	Kenji Sugiyama;Kensaku Monri;Shoji Maruo	2013	MHS2013	10.1109/MHS.2013.6710392	materials science;ceramic materials;piezoelectric sensor;pmut;composite material	Graphics	88.88097615462245	-17.26820584333321	37186

a13f83ca33a48c492bbef40c81813e67a81f7e69	efficient calculation of degenerate atomic rates by numerical quadrature on gpus		The rates of atomic processes in cold, dense plasmas are governed strongly by effects of quantum degeneracy. The electrons follow Fermi-Dirac statistics and their high density limits the number of quantum states available for occupation after a collision. These factors preclude a direct solution to the usual rate coefficient integrals. We summarise the formulation of this problem and present a simple, but efficient method of evaluating collisional rate coefficients via direct numerical integration. Numerical quadrature has an intrinsically high level of parallelism, ideally suited for graphics processor units. GPUs are particularly suited to this problem because of the large number of integrals which must be carried out simultaneously for a given atomic model. A CUDA code to calculate the rates of significant atomic processes as part of a collisional-radiative model is presented and discussed. This approach may be readily extended to other applications where rapid and repeated evaluation of many integrals is required.		V. Aslanyan;A. G. Aslanyan;G. J.

TCR is therefore of significance in the simulation of injection mold ing processes where one of the factors determin ing productivity is the cooling time. Simulation software packages either consider TCR as negli gible or use a constant value based on steady- state conduction, whereas in injection molding, TCR is time-dependent. We use simulation of the injection molding process to show that using TCR values within the range obtained from steady state experiments may lead to underpre dicting cooling times by up to 15% and, hence, there is a need to use time-dependent TCR in the heat transfer simulations. Our simulation result indicates that the value of TCR also affects the frozen layer fraction in the early postfilling period.	computer cooling;computer simulation	Lakshminarayanan Sridhar;Kwabena A.

Jardin, J. Breslau, N. Ferraro, A high-order implicit finite element method for integrating the two-fluid magnetohydrodynamic equations in two dimensions, J. Comp. Phys. 226 (2) (2007) 2146–2174]. This code has now been extended to allow computations in toroidal geometry. Improvements to the spatial integration and time-stepping algorithms are discussed. Steady-states of a resistive two-fluid model, self-consistently including flows, anisotropic viscosity (including gyroviscosity) and heat flux, are calculated for diverted plasmas in geometries typical of the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) [M. Ono et al., Exploration of spherical torus physics in the NSTX device, Nucl. Fusion 40 (3Y) (2000) 557–561]. These states are found by time-integrating the dynamical equations until the steady-state is reached, and are therefore stationary or statistically steady on both magnetohydrodynamic and transport time-scales. Resistively driven cross-surface flows are found to be in close agreement with Pfirsch-Schlüter theory. Poloidally varying toroidal flows are in agreement with comparable calculations [A.Y.

The absence of any observable effect in previous spectroscopic work is explained, and conditions for large effects are outlined. Experimental measurements on thermal conductivity and microwave absorption in films in a magnetic field are described. The results show that in thin films, the gap can be depressed continuously to zero, yielding a second-order phase transition. In thicker films, the gap can be only partially depressed before the transition, and the transition is of first order. These results agree with those obtained theoretically by Douglass from the Ginzburg-Landau-Gor'kov theory, and experimentally, by electron tunnelling. An attempt to generalize the Ginzburg-Landau-Gor'kov theory to cope with thec ase when Ɛ0/kT ≫ I i s then indicated. In thisp henomenological theory, then ormalized gap Ɛ(H)/Ɛ(0) is taken as an order parameter ω, and the free energy is assumed to contain a term in ξ02|∇ω|2, as well as a free energy density f(ω) and magnetic energy x(ω)H2. Some success is found.

Unlike classical thermoreflectance methods, the main point of the method presented in this paper is to be able to quantify the heating energy (by Joule effect) and the effective temperature response (by calibration). It is then possible to estimate the thermal conductivity (in W m -1  K -1 ) instead of the thermal diffusivity (in m 2 s -1 ). A semi-analytical thermal 3D-periodic model then enables to identify a few thermal properties of the layers of the device, and in particular the thermal conductivity of the passivation layer. This methodology has been applied to the study of an industrial device containing interconnect test structures made of copper lines on a silicon wafer with a few micrometers BCB (BenzoCycloButene) polymer passivation layer. The BCB thermal conductivity and the metal heat capacity are obtained using this method.	interferometric microscopy	Stefan Dilhaire;Stéphane Grauby;Wilfrid Claeys;Jean-Christophe Batsale	2004	Microelectronics Journal	10.1016/j.mejo.2004.06.012	thermal conductivity measurement;calibration;heat capacity;passivation;thermal diffusivity;electronic component;copper;thermal conductivity;physics;wafer;quantum mechanics	Crypto	92.39897758293502	-10.666120090712525	37695

Slab models of the adhesion interface were built by integrating a fragment of epoxy resin and hydroxylated (0 0 1) surface of α-cristobalite in the presence of adsorbed water molecules. Effects of adsorbed water on the adhesion interaction are evaluated on the basis of geometry-optimized structures, adhesion energies, and forces. Calculated results demonstrate that adsorbed water molecules significantly reduce both the adhesion energies and forces of the silica surface-epoxy resin interface. The reduction of adhesion properties can be associated with structural deformation of water molecules confined in the tight space between the adhesive and adherend as well as structural flexibility of the hydrogen-bonding network in the interfacial region during detachment of the epoxy resin from the hydrophilic silica surface. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

34fe4c4ae18c69833148d478a4d5321effa40e31	calibration of scanning electron microscope with improved model of the silicon relief measure		Accuracy of measurements with scanning electron microscope (SEM) depends on the environment conditions, noises in nanometer-ranges (caused by non-ideal surface of measures), non-ideal SEM design, influence of external factors (vibration, acoustic noise, magnetic fields, etc.). To reduce the influence of these variables, the calibration procedure, with the use of silicon measures to reproduce dimensions is performed preferably. The model of measure real image (which is used for calibration) can be formalized as the convolution of the level of secondary electron emission and the distribution of electrons in the crossover of the electron probe. Based on the developed model, the general approach to SEM calibration is formulated and proved. The step by step removal of non-parametric and parametric uncertainty of scale factor and electron probe equivalent diameter is proposed. As the first step, the approximation of individual cuts on the measured object image, which correspond to the same cuts of measure relief with further averaging and estimating the metrological parameters and their error distributions, is performed. In the second step (of optimal estimation), the vector containing metrological characteristics using Bayesian criterion and the theory of optimal estimations is find. Proposed approach can significantly increase SEM accuracy and performance.	electron	Anton Shantyr;Eugenij Volodarski;Zygmunt L.

The magic-T is based on an H-plane waveguide 3-dB directional coupler exploiting slow-wave corrugations on the narrow walls of one of the waveguide arms. These corrugations contribute to an additional phase shift of 90° in this waveguide arm. The magic-T is fabricated with ceramic-filled resin by employing stereolithography 3-D printing technique, which is followed by an electroless nickel/copper plating process to metallize its entire surface. The 3-D printed magic-T has little redundant structural material, a light weight (19.5 g), and good mechanical strength as well as thermal handling capability.

1bf3b4d9693b3ff9b1a17dd1f72beee5448db120	chemical kinetics in situations intermediate between usual and high concentrations: fuzzy-motivated derivation of the formulas		In the traditional chemical kinetics, the rate of each reaction A+ . . .+B → . . . is proportional to the product cA · . . . · cB of the concentrations of all the input substances A, . . . , B. For high concentrations cA, . . . , cB , the reaction rate is known to be proportional to the minimum min(cA, . . . , cB). In this paper, we use fuzzy-related ideas to derive the formula of the reaction rate for situations intermediate between usual and high concentrations. I. CHEMICAL KINETICS IN SITUATIONS INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN USUAL AND HIGH CONCENTRATIONS: FORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM Chemical kinetics: usual formulas. Chemical kinetics describes the rate of chemical reactions. For usual concentrations, the rate of a reaction between two substances A and B is proportional to the product cA · cB of their concentrations; see, e.g., [3], [7]. Similarly, if we have a reaction A + . . . + B → . . . with three or more substances, the rate of this reaction is proportional to the products of the concentrations of all these substances cA · . . . · cB . How formulas of chemical kinetics are usually derived. Let us start the explanation of how the general formulas of chemical kinetics are derived by first considering the case of two substances A and B. Molecules of both substances are randomly distributed in space. So, for each molecule of the substance A, the probability that it meets a molecule of the substance B is proportional to the concentration cB . If the molecules meet, then (with a certain probability) they get into a reaction. Thus, the expected number of reactions involving a given molecule of the substance A is also proportional to cB . The total number of A-molecules in a given volume is proportional to cA; thus, the total number of reactions per unit time is proportional to cA · cB . Similarly, for the case of three or more substances, we can conclude that the reaction rate is indeed proportional to the product cA · . . . · cB . Case of high concentrations. When the concentrations are very high, there is no need for the molecules to randomly bump into each other; these molecules are everywhere. So, as soon as we have molecules of all needed type, the reaction starts. In other words, in this case, the reaction rate is proportional to the concentration of the corresponding tuples – i.e., to the minimum min(cA, . . . , cB) of all the input concentrations cA, . . . , cB . Example. The formula min(cA, . . . , cB) can be easily illustrated on the example of a relation which is non-chemical reaction but which is described by the same chemical kinetictype equations: the relation between predators and prey. When we have usual (small) concentrations of wolves W and rabbits R in a forest, the probability for a wolf to find a rabbit is proportional to the concentration cR of rabbits, so the overall amount of rabbits eaten by wolves is proportional to the product cW · cR. On the other hand, for high concentrations, e.g., if we throw a bunch of rabbits into a zoo cage filled with hungry wolves, there is no need to look for a prey, each wolf will start eating its rabbit – as long as there are sufficiently many rabbits to feed all the wolves. So: • When cR ≥ cW , the number of eaten rabbits will be proportional to the number of wolves, i.e., to cW . • In situations when there are not enough rabbits (i.e., when cR < cW ), the number of eaten rabbits is proportional to the number of rabbits, i.e., to cR. In both cases, the reaction rate is proportional to min(cR, cW ). Empirical evidence for high-concentration reaction rate. The high-concentration reaction rate indeed turned out to be very useful to describe biochemical processes; see, e.g., [2], [8]. Interesting observation: simulations of high-concentration reactions lead to efficient algorithms. It is known that in many cases, difficult-to-solve computational problems can be reduced to problems of chemical kinetics. In such situations of chemical computing, we can efficiently solve the original computational problems by either actually performing the corresponding chemical reactions, or by performing a computer simulation of these reactions; see, e.g., [1]. To make the simulations as fast as possible, it is desirable to simulate reactions which are as fast as possible. The reaction rate increases with the concentrations of the reagents. Thus, to speed up simulations, we should simulate high-concentration reactions. This simulation indeed speeds up the corresponding computations; see, e.g., [5], [6]. Main problem. While we know the formulas for the usual and for the high concentrations, it is not clear how to compute the reaction rate for concentrations between usual and high. What is known. Both formulas r = cA · cB and r = min(cA, cB) are particular cases of t-norms (“and”-operations in fuzzy logic; see, e.g., [4], [9], [11]). This is not a coincidence: there is no reaction if one of the substances is missing, so cA = 0 or cB imply that r = 0 – which is exactly the property of a t-norm. Fuzzy t-norms have indeed been effectively used to describe chemical reactions [2], [8]. Remaining problem. The problem is that there are many possible “and”-operations, and it is not clear which one we should select. What we do in this paper. In this paper, we use the analysis of the corresponding chemical processes to derive the formulas that adequately describe the reaction rate in intermediate situations – and thus, to appropriately select the corresponding “and”-operation. II. CHEMICAL KINETICS IN SITUATIONS INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN USUAL AND HIGH CONCENTRATIONS: ANALYSIS OF THE PROBLEM, RESULTING FORMULAS, AND DISCUSSION Towards formulating the problem in precise terms. Let us start with the case of two substances A and B. As we have mentioned earlier, the two molecules get into a reaction only when they are close enough. When these molecules are close enough, then, within the corresponding small region, the reaction rate is proportional to the minimum min(cA, cB) of their concentrations. When concentrations are small, then, within each region, we have either zero or one molecule; the probability to have two molecules is very small (proportional to the square of these concentrations) and can, therefore, be safely ignored. In this case, for each region, the reaction occurs if we have both an A-molecule and a B-molecule. The probability to have an A-molecule is proportional to cA; the probability to have a B-molecule is proportional to cB . Since the distributions for A and B are independent, the probability to have both Aand B-molecules in a region is equal to the product of these probabilities and is, thus, proportional to the product of the concentrations cA · cB . When the concentrations are high, then each region has molecules of both types. The average number of A-molecules in a region is proportional to cA, i.e., has the form k · cA for some proportionality coefficient k. Similarly, the average number of B-molecules in a region is equal to k · cB . So the average reaction rate is proportional to min(k · cA, k · cB) = k ·min(cA, cB), i.e., is proportional to min(cA, cB). This analysis leads us to the following reformulation of our problem. Resulting formulation of the problem in precise terms. Within a unit volume, we have a certain number r of “ small regions”, i.e., regions such that only molecules within the same region can interact with each other. We have a total of NA = N ·cA molecules of the substance A, and we have a total of NB = N · cB molecules of the substance B. Each of these molecules is randomly distributed among the regions, i.e., it can be located in any of the r regions with equal probability. Distributions of different molecules are independent from each other. Within each region, the reaction rate is proportional to the minimum min(nA, nB) of the numbers nA and nB of Aand B-molecules in this region. The overall reaction rate can be computed as the average over all the regions – i.e., in other words, as the mathematical expectation of this minimum. Analysis of the problem. Based on the above description, the number of A-molecules in a region follows the Poisson distribution (see, e.g., [10]), according to which, for each value k, the probability to have exactly nA = k A-molecules is equal to Prob(nA = k) = exp(−λA) · λA k! . (1) The mean value of the Poisson random variable is λA; on the other hand, we have N · cA A-molecules in r cells, so the average number of A-molecules in a cell is equal to the ratio N · cA r , so	algorithm;chemical computer;chemical database;coefficient;computation;computational problem;computer simulation;fuzzy logic;jaccard index;kinesiology;kinetics internet protocol;naive bayes classifier;norm (social);prey;randomness;t-norm fuzzy logics;thermal copper pillar bump	Olga Kosheleva;Vladik Kreinovich;Laécio Carvalho Barros	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-75408-6_40		Theory	94.5816706928923	-3.02958686112589	38220

Since silicon and glass are very hard and brittle, drilling fluid access holes or dicing the substrates into individual devices are difficult. We investigated the use of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) as a new substrate material. PMMA, an amorphous thermoplastic, was chosen because it is easy to drill or cut, biocompatible, transparent, and hundreds of times cheaper than silicon or glass wafers. Moreover, its thermal expansion coefficient ideally matches that of SU8. PMMA poorly resists solvents, and has low glass transition temperature (105C). Thus, the conventional process was modified. The substrate was only cleaned with isopropyl alcohol and deionized water. The baking temperature was lowered to 90C. In addition, a “base layer” of SU-8, helping to achieve a high quality structural pattern, was coated before coating the actual structural SU-8 layer. A Tesla valve, a non-moving part microfluidic valve, was successfully fabricated in SU-8 using the presented process. However, the PMMA substrate bowed due to the thermal residual during baking steps. Despite the bowing problem, which can be solved by increasing substrate thickness, we conclude that PMMA is a promising material for SU-8 process.	coefficient;dicing;display resolution;structural pattern;substrate (electronics);tesla coil;thickness (graph theory)	Thai-Quang Truong;Nam-Trung Nguyen	2003	International Journal of Computational Engineering Science	10.1142/S1465876303002003	materials science;ceramic materials;microfluidics;su-8 photoresist;nanotechnology;composite material;fabrication;photolithography;physics	HCI	92.76946820575618	-15.064733308998015	38354

dc6f61a975a0e23adf21f38b795f47671b9ef5ed	a viscoelastic model for the long-term deflection of segmental prestressed box girders		Most of segmental prestressed concrete box girders exhibit excessive multidecade deflections unforeseeable by past and current design codes. In order to investigate such a behavior, mainly caused by creep and shrinkage phenomena, an effective FE formulation is presented in this paper. This formulation is developed by invoking the stationarity of an energetic principle for linear viscoelastic problems and relies on the Bazant creep constitutive law. A case study representative of segmental prestressed concrete box girders susceptible to creep is also analyzed in the paper, i.e. the Colle Isarco viaduct. Its FE model, based on the aforementioned energetic formulation, was successfully validated through the comparison with monitoring field data. As a result, the proposed 1D FE model can effectively reproduce the past behavior of the viaduct and predict its future behavior with a reasonable run time, which represents a decisive factor for the model implementation in a decision support system.

A series of air tracks are inflated by a gas generator to pump up a series of air-pockets, mini-airbags, and a collar protection region, preferably with a series of concentric circular cylinders which expand and provide resistance to motions that are transverse to the concentric axis. A plurality of caps are telescopically disposed within the tracks and are forced upwards by the injected gas. These caps form a column that, together with the other columns and a support member Within the jacket collar, forms an exoskeleton around the jockeyu0027s neck. A base webbing provides support for the columns. The jacket includes microelectronics to control the jacket actuation. The jacket is usable for other activities, such as motorcycling.	e-commerce payment system;information security	Karim Mohammed Rezaul;Mohammad Rahman;Aliar Hossain	2009			computer science;collar;concentric;computer security;gas generator;webbing	AI	83.13132321501328	-19.527047668163426	38508

The entire actuator consists of two basic parts, namely the front (central) and rear chambers, from which fluid is displaced by the opposite sides of the same diaphragm. The actuator operates in a double-acting (antiphase) regime with air as the working fluid. The central chamber generates the standard (zero-net-mass-flux) axisymmetric synthetic jet (SJ), while the rear chamber generates system of several non-zero-net-mass-flux HSJs arranged around the central SJ. A number of variants of HSJs with different geometry were designed, manufactured and tested. Their behavior was investigated experimentally using the smoke visualization, reaction force measurement, hot-wire anemometry, and naphthalene sublimation technique. The tests confirm the efficiency of the present design.	synthetic intelligence	Zdeněk Trávníček;Václav Tesar;Jozef Kordík	2008	J.

The influence of the spindle speed and the feed rate on thrust force, torque, drilling time, burr height, burr thickness, roundness and roughness have been investigated and a mathematical model has been proposed in the present work. Contour graphs are used to study the effect of drilling parameters on the various objectives of the experimental investigation. The response of material behaviour with respect to the given input has been analysed in order to understand the deeds. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to identify the significant drilling parameters on their performance characteristics. The developed regression model is in good agreement with the present experimental results. Further spindle speed and feed rate were optimised as 539.47253 rpm and 0.03828 mm/rev. respectively through genetic algorithm (GA) in order to minimise the responses.	duplex (telecommunications);evolutionary algorithm;mathematical optimization	M.

In the present study, an elastic finger-shaped sensor made of silicone rubber is designed and produced. First, geometry of the finger-shaped sensor is designed using finite element analysis (FEA). Results of FEA revealed that strain detected using strain gage incorporated near the edge of the contact surface varies when the friction coefficient between the finger-shaped sensor and a planar object varies. Then, in an experiment using the newly designed sensor, it is confirmed that the friction coefficient between the finger and the object is detected using the strain inside the finger when the sensor is pressed against the object.	coefficient;correctness (computer science);finite element method;sensor;shape optimization;simulation;skin friction line	Takahashi Maeno;Tomoyuki Kawamura	2003		10.1109/ROBOT.2003.1241809	strain gauge;finite element method;friction;engineering drawing;tactile sensor;quantum mechanics	Robotics	88.94175259253639	-19.558744639168182	38661

This paper introduces a dynamic turbulence model which can impact the flame spreading. According to the model, the flame spreading and temperature field of ceramic roller kiln are simulated in order to better understand the combustion of ceramic roller kiln. To strengthen the effect of three-dimensional visual simulation, two mechanisms are provided, one is particle collision and detection, and another is the temperature-color mapping table. It’s shown that this visual model is feasible and of high performance.	particle system;simulation;turbulence	Wenbi Rao;Weixia Shi	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-11842-5_45	turbulence;three-dimensional space;simulation;visualization;computer science;particle system	EDA	89.7253504603868	-4.023836620631716	38705

We would like to examine which structural factors generate this pattern of superposition. Example studies suggest that in many ligand-protein pairs, there exist principal formal charges on each molecule, largely responsible for the electrostatic potential complementarity observed. Electrostatic potential complementarity depends on the relative disposition of these principal charges and the ligand van der Waals surface. Simple mathematical models were constructed to predict the complementarity solely from structural considerations. The essential conditions for electrostatic potential complementarity were elucidated. These can be used in ligand design strategies to obtain an electrostatically optimal ligand.		P.-L. Chau;Philip M.

In this paper, we analyze these amplitude equations using dynamical systems theory. Regions of the parametric space that correspond to bounded solutions are determined and some explicit representations of the bounded solutions are obtained. It is shown that the resonant-triad interaction can lead to chaotic motions.		Jibin Li;Yibin Fu;Fengjuan Chen	2009	I. J.

The upper surface of the liquid film is considered free and adiabatic. Velocity and temperature profiles are obtained analytically and used to compute the entropy generation number (Ns), irreversibility ratio (Ф) and the Bejan number (Be) for several values of the viscous dissipation parameter (BrΩ), viscosity index (n) and the dimensionless axial distance (X). The Bejan number increases in the transverse direction and decreases as the viscous dissipation parameter (BrΩ) increases. The numerical results show that the Bejan number decreases as the viscous dissipation parameter (BrΩ), Peclet number (Pe) and the viscosity index (n) increase.	numerical analysis;transverse wave;velocity	Rama Subba Reddy Gorla;David M.

The surface of the cone and the ambient medium are maintained at constant but different levels of temperature and concentration. The Ostwald–de Waele power law model is used to characterize the non-Newtonian fluid behavior. The governing equations are non-dimensionalized into non-similar form and then solved numerically by local non-similarity method. The effect of non-Darcy parameter, viscous dissipation parameter, Soret parameter, buoyancy ratio, Lewis number and the power-law index parameter on the temperature and concentration field as well as on the heat and mass transfer coefficients is analyzed.	cone tracing	R.

In this study, surface temperatures with and without heat insulation during the overwintering period are calculated. Using the material properties of roller-compacted concrete (RCC) as bases, we simulate and analyse the temperature field and thermal stress of certain RCC gravity dams in cold regions. The simulation and analysis are performed by three-dimensional finite element relocating mesh method under the following conditions: under the absence of heat insulation, and with the application of a 5 or 8cm polystyrene slab for heat conservation. Moreover, the effects of superficial insulation and different thicknesses on the temperature field and thermal stress are analysed. Results show that superficial insulation can considerably increase the superficial temperature of RCC dams in cold regions, thereby decreasing superficial temperature difference and maximal tensile stress. These conditions prevent surface cracks from forming.	the superficial	Xiao-fei Zhang;Shouyi Li;Yan-long Li;Yao Ge;Hui Li	2011	Advances in Engineering Software	10.1016/j.advengsoft.2011.06.004	material properties;three-dimensional space;temperature;roller-compacted concrete;finite element method;geotechnical engineering;stress;thermodynamics	SE	87.10121107148741	-11.754180794214735	39334

The capacity of most existing self-sensing approaches is restricted to static strains or low-frequency structural vibration. In this study, a new breed of functionalized epoxy-based composites is developed and fabricated, with a graphene nanoparticle-enriched, dispersed sensing network, whereby to self-perceive broadband elastic disturbance from static strains, through low-frequency vibration to guided waves in an ultrasonic regime. Owing to the dispersed and networked sensing capability, signals can be captured at any desired part of the composites. Experimental validation has demonstrated that the functionalized composites can self-sense strains, outperforming conventional metal foil strain sensors with a significantly enhanced gauge factor and a much broader response bandwidth. Precise and fast self-response of the composites to broadband ultrasonic signals (up to 440 kHz) has revealed that the composite structure itself can serve as ultrasound sensors, comparable to piezoceramic sensors in performance, whereas avoiding the use of bulky cables and wires as used in a piezoceramic sensor network. This study has spotlighted promising potentials of the developed approach to functionalize conventional composites with a self-sensing capability of high-sensitivity yet minimized intrusion to original structures.	artificial nanoparticles;atomic electron transition;cable;composite pattern;dental intrusion;epoxy resins;foil device component;graphene;kilohertz;list of wireless mice with nano receivers;piezoelectricity;polymer;robotic materials;ultrasonics (sound);sensor (device)	Yehai Li;Kai Wang;Zhongqing Su	2018		10.3390/s18051398	wireless sensor network;epoxy;electronic engineering;graphene;engineering;gauge factor;structural health monitoring;ultrasonic sensor;broadband;vibration;composite material	Mobile	93.6996679133749	-20.298279843744893	39345

This tool was developed in the Fortran 90 programming language as an external module for the CCHE2D application, an existing two-dimensional hydrodynamic numerical model developed at the National Center for Computational Hydroscience and Engineering, University of Mississippi. Velocity outputs generated by the CCHE2D model are used by HYDROKAL to compute the instantaneous power density, an essential element in calculating the hydrokinetic power of a river reach. The tool includes a user-defined efficiency factor to account for turbine efficiency, which is fundamental for estimating the energy that could be harvested from the river. For each river cross section along the computational domain, maximum velocity and specific discharge are identified to assist in estimating the stability of the river reach and, thus, the feasibility of installing an in-stream turbine. A Python script was also developed to export the results from HYDROKAL to CCHE2D. HYDROKAL is applied to a reach of the Tanana River at Nenana, Alaska, USA. & 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The model is an improvement over standard Monte Carlo algorithms, which usually retain fixed atom positions and bond partners indicative of perfect crystal lattices. Indeed, we extend the concepts of Monte Carlo growth simulations on super-lattices containing additional sites (defect sites) with respect to those of the reference material. This extension implies a reconsideration of the energetic mapping, which is extensively presented, and allows to describe a complex phenomenology that is out of accessibility of standard stochastic approaches. Results obtained using the Kawasaki and the Bond-Counting rules for the transition probability of the Monte Carlo event are discussed in details. These results demonstrate how the defect types (local or extended), the formation mechanisms and the defect generation regimes can be characterized using our approach. 2007 Elsevier Inc.

48056525ece74dfb2150498db966c78148ff75db	modulation analysis for a stochastic nls equation arising in bose-einstein condensation		We study the asymptotic behavior of the solution of a model equation for Bose–Einstein condensation, in the case where the trapping potential varies randomly in time. The model is the so called Gross–Pitaevskii equation, with a quadratic potential with white noise fluctuations in time whose amplitude ε tends to zero. The initial condition of the solution is a standing wave solution of the unperturbed equation. We prove that up to times of the order of ε−2, the solution decomposes into the sum of a randomly modulated standing wave and a small remainder, and we derive the equations for the modulation parameters. In addition, we show that the first order of the remainder, as ε goes to zero, converges to a Gaussian process, whose expected mode amplitudes concentrate on the third eigenmode generated by the Hermite functions, on a certain time scale.	bose–einstein condensation (network theory);gaussian process;hermite polynomials;initial condition;modulation;normal mode;quantum harmonic oscillator;randomness;white noise	Anne de Bouard;Reika Fukuizumi	2009	Asymptotic Analysis	10.3233/ASY-2008-0931	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;calculus;mathematics;quantum mechanics	ML	87.67597255927606	1.2490171847217122	39661

Evaluating delamination onset criteria based on stress-strength relations requires an accurate representation of the through-the-thickness stress distribution, which is delicate for thin shell-like structures. Therefore, in this paper, a solid-shell finite element is utilized, which allows for incorporating a fully three-dimensional, anisotropic, micro-mechanically motivated material model, still being suited for application to thin structures. Moreover, locking phenomena are cured by using both the enhanced assumed strain (EAS) and the assumed natural strain (ANS) concept, and numerical efficiency is ensured through reduced integration.	numerical analysis;onset (audio)	Jaan-Willem Simon;Bertram Stier;Stefanie Reese	2015	Advances in Engineering Software	10.1016/j.advengsoft.2014.09.022	structural engineering;fiber-reinforced composite;fiber pull-out;delamination	SE	88.30398813643606	-5.6678860904072765	39676

We used a TCAD simulation of the full EEPROM cell to precisely determine the control gate bias voiding the electric field through ONO or tunnel oxide. Data retention measurements are then performed with simulated bias. We highlight the fact that leakage paths during data retention are different for extrinsic and intrinsic cells. Indeed, extrinsic behavior disappears when voiding electric field across tunnel oxide, showing these cells leak through tunnel oxide, whereas intrinsic behavior is the same whatever the electric field across tunnel oxide, showing charge loss in intrinsic cells is due to another path."""	non-volatile memory;spectral leakage	Jérémy Postel-Pellerin;Romain Laffont;Gilles Micolau;Frédéric Lalande;Arnaud Régnier;Bernard Bouteille	2010	Microelectronics Reliability	10.1016/j.microrel.2010.07.074	embedded system;electronic engineering;non-volatile memory;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;electric field;stacking;integrated circuit;computer aided design;circuit design;physics;quantum mechanics	Robotics	91.7414936208709	-10.108257146863751	39908

Combining computational fluid dynamics with low-order acoustic modeling, the open-loop transfer function of the system under investigation is computed. The system eigenmodes and the linear stability characteristics are then deduced from a Nyquist plot. The method is suitable for systems where - due to geometrical complexities or non-compact regions of heat release - a low-order formulation is not appropriate or not available. Explicit knowledge of the frequency response or the transfer matrix of the heat source is not required. Further advantages of the new approach are discussed in the paper. To establish proof of concept, the method is validated against a simple model of a Rijke tube. Over the frequency range considered, frequencies and growth rates of stable as well as unstable eigenmodes are predicted accurately. The new method, combining flow simulation, low-order acoustic modeling and control theory, makes possible a comprehensive analysis of acoustic stability behavior of complex thermo-acoustic systems at comparatively modest computational cost.	acoustic cryptanalysis;nyquist rate;nyquist stability criterion	Jan Kopitz;Wolfgang Polifke	2008	J.

Later, the cracked rotor system is modeled with bond graphs as it facilitates the system modeling from the physical paradigms. The mathematical stiffness matrixes for cracked elements are computed and a detailed integrated bond graph model is created, which will portray the exact and accurate dynamics of a cracked rotor system.

4dcdb1a3543a0331a4795acb7a285a965939ce30	a new approach for user-independent determination of formability of a steel sheet sheared edge		It is common to use a forming limit curve (FLC) for a feasibility study of a deep-drawn steel part based on a finite element analysis (FEA). However, in such an approach a neglected fact is that a blank edge in industrial production is often produced by shear cutting. Especially, for many high strength steel grades, this cutting process notably reduces edge formability. An overestimation of formability of the blank edge, with an FLC, is the consequence that may lead to cracks at the sheared edge of a part. The following paper describes a new approach to determine formability of a sheet-steel sheared edge by hole expansion test that uses an FLC tool set. This approach delivers a hole expansion ratio with considerably lower scattering compared to the hole expansion according to ISO 16630. Additionally, information on the planar isotropy, flow and necking behavior of the material, is supplied. Finally, a pragmatical way of transferring test results into an FEA of the forming process for a sheet blank with a sheared edge is presented.

Titania conformal coating on the surface of phosphor particles was conducted by the hydrolysis and condensation of titanium isopropoxide. The humidity resistance test in the state of LED package including pristine phosphor or coated phosphor was carried out. As a result, titania surface coating prevented the drastic decrease in light output power and electrical open failure originating from the phosphor decomposition by reaction with moisture. Therefore, it was concluded that titania conformal coating layer played a role as a barrier against the moisture and prolonged the lifetime of pristine phosphor.	diode;phosphor	So-Ra Gang;Deokgi Kim;Sang-Mook Kim;Nam Hwang;Kwang-Cheol Lee	2012	Microelectronics Reliability	10.1016/j.microrel.2012.06.142		Robotics	91.44204802505554	-13.073841280385752	40856

In fibre reinforced plastics, embedded fibre Bragg gratings are found to be one of the most popular and reliable solutions for strain monitoring. Despite of their growing popularity, users should keep in mind their shortcomings, many of which are associated with the embedding process. This review paper starts with an overview of some of the technical issues to be considered when embedding fibre optics in fibrous composite materials. Next, a monitoring scheme is introduced which shows the different steps necessary to relate the output of an embedded FBG to the strain of the structure in which it is embedded. Each step of the process has already been addressed separately in literature without considering the complete cycle, from embedding of the sensor to the internal strain measurement of the structure. This review paper summarizes the work reported in literature and tries to fit it into the big picture of internal strain measurements with embedded fibre Bragg gratings. The last part of the paper focuses on temperature compensation methods which should not be ignored in terms of in-situ measurement of strains with fibre Bragg gratings. Throughout the paper criticism is given where appropriate, which should be regarded as opportunities for future research.	embedding;optical fiber;optics;plastics;sensor;tissue fiber	Geert Luyckx;Eli Voet;Nicolas Lammens;Joris Degrieck	2011		10.3390/s110100384	telecommunications;computer science;optical fiber;physics	Embedded	91.76541964362796	-19.36259531516052	40965

This work presents a SET seasoning model implemented within a numerical simulator starting from the extraction of the characteristic erase operation kinetic parameters, in order to complete the picture of seasoning modeling in PCM. The analysis of such phenomenon, that is not detrimental to the memory, allows a better comprehension of the transition dynamics from the amorphous to the crystalline phase.

This task is accomplished with a pair of modified ring oscillators (ROSCs) which are representative of standard CMOS circuits. We use a ¿backdrive¿ concept, in which one ROSC drives the voltage transitions in both structures during stress, such that the driving oscillator ages due to both BTI and HCI, while the other suffers from only BTI. In addition, long term or high voltage experiments facilitate TDDB measurements in both oscillators. Sub-¿s measurements are controlled by on-chip logic in order to avoid excessive unwanted BTI recovery during stress interruptions. Sub-ps frequency resolution is achieved during these short measurements using a beat frequency detection system, and we automate the experiments through a simple digital interface. Measurement results are presented from a 65 nm test chip over a range of stress conditions.	btrieve;cmos;experiment;hot-carrier injection;human–computer interaction;instability;multi-function printer	John Keane;Xiaofei Wang;Devin Persaud;Chris H.

This paper investigates flow characteristics and mixing efficiency of three different geometries in micro-channels. The geometries of these channels were rectangular with a dimension of; 300 m wide, 100 m deep and 50 mm long. In first channel there was no obstacle and in the second channel there were rectangular blocks of dimension 300 m long and 150 m wide are placed in the flow fields with every 300 m distance attaching along the channel wall. In the third geometry, there were 100 m wide fins with 150° angle which were placed at a distance of 500 m apart from each other attached with the wall along the 50 mm channel. Fluent software of Com-putational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was used to investigate the flow characteristics within these microfluidic model for three different geometries. A species 2D model was created for three geometries and simulations were run in order to investigate the mixing behaviour of two different fluid with viscosity of water (1 mPa s). Models were only built to investigate the effect of geometry, therefore only one fluid with similar viscosity was used in these models. Velocity vector plots were used in the CFD analysis to visualise the fluid flow path. Mass fractions of fluid were used to analyse the mixing efficiency. Two different col-ours for water were used to simulate the effect of two different fluids. The results showed that the mixing behaviour strongly depended on the channel geometry when other parameters such as fluid inlet velocity, viscosity and pressure of fluids were kept constant. In two geometries lateral pressure and swirling vortexes were developed which provided better mixing results. Creation of swirling vortexes increased diffusion gradients which enhanced diffusive mixing.	anisotropic diffusion;col (game);computational fluid dynamics;gradient;lateral thinking;mixing (mathematics);simulation;velocity (software development)	Sumsun Naher;D.

The mathematical model consists of balance equations for gas and liquid phases. Reaction rate equations, transport models and mass balances were coupled to generalized heterogeneous models which were solved with respect to time and space with algorithms suitable for partial differential equations. The importance of mass transfer resistance inside the catalyst pellets as well as the dynamics of the different phases being present in the reactor is revealed. The dynamic mathematical model presented can be used to analyze and understand the interaction of various processes that take place inside the hydrogenation reactor and also to make preliminary calculation of experimental parameters. Another important use of the mathematical model is to determine the optimal operation conditions and to design the control system. The model is implemented in Matlab and tested in simulations achieving successful results.

5e54003bc97751d2076e5bc0f01075f8f4a3df2d	q2dtor: a program to treat torsional anharmonicity through coupled pair torsions in flexible molecules		Abstract The Q 2DTor program (Quantum 2-Dimensional Torsions) is designed to calculate accurate rotational–vibrational partition functions (also called rovibrational partition functions) and thermodynamic functions for molecular systems having two [1] or more torsions. Systems with more than two torsions can also be studied by treating the torsions by pairs. The program searches for all the torsional conformers and evaluates the rovibrational partition function using the multi-structural harmonic oscillator (MS-HO) approximation and the extended two-dimensional torsion (E2DT) approximation. The latter incorporates full coupling of the two torsions by means of the two-dimensional non-separable (2D-NS) approximation [2], and it also includes their influence on the remaining degrees of freedom. The program also calculates the ideal gas-phase standard-state thermodynamic functions at the requested temperatures. Twenty molecules have been used to test Q 2DTor. Program summary Program Title: Q2DTor Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/wbgchgc2kp.1 Licensing provisions: GNU GPL v3 Programming language: Python 2.7 Nature of problem: Calculation of accurate partition functions and thermodynamic functions in molecular systems involving two torsional modes. Torsional anharmonicity is treated quantically and includes full coupling in the kinetic and potential energies between the torsions and between the torsions and the rest of the degrees of freedom. Solution method: The program uses the variational method to solve the Schrodinger equation of a two-dimensional torsional potential using Fourier series. All of the remaining degrees of freedom (non-torsional) are incorporated through a projected (the torsional modes are removed) rigid-rotator harmonic-oscillator partition function which is calculated at every torsional stationary point and that is allowed to vary with the torsional motion. The integration of the rovibrational partition function over the torsional space leads to a mixed quantum-classical vibrational partition function, which is transformed into a full quantum partition function by including the quantum contribution due to the torsions. For the evaluation of the integral, the rovibrational partition function at nonstationary points is carried out through a Delaunay triangulation procedure using the calculated rovibrational partition functions at the stationary points as nodes. Additional comments including Restrictions and Unusual features: The program is limited to two coupled torsional modes. References: [1] L. Simon-Carballido et al., J. Chem.

Beginning with a discrete dynamical model, we derive a variational description of the corresponding continuum population density. Equilibrium solutions are extrema of an energy functional, and satisfy a Fredholm integral equation. We find conditions for the extrema to be local minimizers, global minimizers, and minimizers with respect to infinitesimal Lagrangian displacements of mass. In one spatial dimension, for a variety of exogenous forces, endogenous forces, and domain configurations, we find exact analytical expressions for the equilibria. These agree closely with numerical simulations of the underlying discrete model.The exact solutions provide a sampling of the wide variety of equilibrium configurations possible within our general swarm modeling framework. The equilibria typically are compactly supported and may contain δ-concentrations or jump discontinuities at the edge of the support. We apply our methods to a model of locust swarms, which are observed in nature to consist of a concentrated population on the ground separated from an airborne group. Our model can reproduce this configuration; quasi-twodimensionality of the model plays a critical role.	airborne ranger;apache continuum;augmented lagrangian method;calculus of variations;dynamical system;numerical analysis;primer;quantum harmonic oscillator;sampling (signal processing);simulation;social force model;swarm intelligence;triune continuum paradigm	Andrew J.

With suitably chosen systems such as superconductors, many of sources of noise can be suppressed. However, imprecision in nanofabrication will inevitably induce defects and disorder, such as charged impurities in the device material or substrate. Such defects generically produce telegraph noise and can hence be modelled as bistable fluctuators. We demonstrate the possibility of the active suppression of such telegraph noise by bang–bang control through an exhaustive study of a qubit coupled to a single bistable fluctuator. We use a stochastic Schrödinger equation, which is solved both numerically and analytically. The resulting dynamics can be visualized as diffusion of a spin vector on the Bloch sphere. We find that bang–bang control suppresses the effect of a bistable fluctuator by a factor roughly equalling the ratio of the bang–bang period and the typical fluctuator period. Therefore, we show the bang–bang protocol works essentially as a high pass filter on the spectrum of such telegraph noise sources. This suggests how the influence of 1/f -noise ubiquitous to the solid state world could be reduced, as it is typically generated by an ensemble of bistable fluctuators. Finally, we develop random walk models that estimate the level of noise suppression resulting from imperfect bang–bang operations, such as those that cannot be treated as δ-function impulses and those that have phase and axis errors.	apache axis;bang file;bang–bang control;bloch sphere;computer architecture;multivibrator;numerical analysis;pink noise;quantum computing;qubit;scalability;schrödinger;solid-state drive;spinor;substrate (electronics);zero suppression	Henryk Gutmann;Frank K.

The Sn–Ag TLP interlayer material was produced in the form of preforms of multilayer foils, using electrochemical deposition. The foils were designed to keep the overall composition of Ag and Sn about 80% and 20% respectively. The optimized TLP bonding process parameters were used during the assembly process. The die-attachment characterizations revealed that resulting intermetallic compounds (Ag3Sn and ζ) have melting point beyond 480 °C. The die-attachment produced low bending stresses, while heated from 30 °C to 400 °C. The reliability of Sn–Ag TLP bonded samples was studied during passive temperature cycling and during active power cycling. During power cycling, the crack rates were determined by measuring the crack lengths of the TLP bonded joints after failure. The failure criteria were set to be an increase of diode's forward voltage by 10% since the start of the power cycling tests. The thermo-mechanical simulations were performed to determine the damage parameter i.e. strain range amplitude ∆ ep. Based on mechanical characterization of the TLP bonded layers, a plastic material model was used. The crack propagation rates were modeled using Paris' Law. Based on comparisons with state-of-the-art silver sintering technique, it can be stated that the TLP bonding is a promising die-attachment technique and its power cycling reliability is similar to silver sintering.	reliability engineering	Adeel Ahmad Bajwa;Jürgen Wilde	2016	Microelectronics Reliability	10.1016/j.microrel.2016.02.016	structural engineering;forensic engineering	EDA	89.23208698807154	-12.566241202344884	42262

First, we carry out experiment about the relation between tensile strength and bending ratio D/d, where D is pulley diameter and d is rope diameter. Although it is widely known that a metal wire rope gets strength reduction under smallD/d, we newly detected that a synthetic fiber rope also gets strength reduction in the same way. Secondly, we evaluate the strength of various end fixation method of synthetic fiber rope. Knot fixation makes rope strength half in all kinds of knot. Clamping fixation with enough pressuring force can get large strength even if a synthetic fiber rope has low friction coefficient. Although calking fixation and sewing fixation cannot change rope length easily, they can get the largest strength around 85–90% of the rope strength in our experiment.

3eeeb2388b72f94ad422f45a199cdf314fde9ca7	modelling the effect of gap junctions on tissue-level cardiac electrophysiology		When modelling tissue-level cardiac electrophysiology, continuum approximations to the discrete cell-level equations are used to maintain computational tractability. One of the most commonly used models is represented by the bidomain equations, the derivation of which relies on a homogenisation technique to construct a suitable approximation to the discrete model. This derivation does not explicitly account for the presence of gap junctions connecting one cell to another. It has been seen experimentally [Rohr, Cardiovasc. Res. 2004] that these gap junctions have a marked effect on the propagation of the action potential, specifically as the upstroke of the wave passes through the gap junction. In this paper we explicitly include gap junctions in a both a 2D discrete model of cardiac electrophysiology, and the corresponding continuum model, on a simplified cell geometry. Using these models we compare the results of simulations using both continuum and discrete systems. We see that the form of the action potential as it passes through gap junctions cannot be replicated using a continuum model, and that the underlying propagation speed of the action potential ceases to match up between models when gap junctions are introduced. In addition, the results of the discrete simulations match the characteristics of those shown in Rohr 2004. From this, we suggest that a hybrid model — a discrete system following the upstroke of the action potential, and a continuum system elsewhere — may give a more accurate description of cardiac electrophysiology.	action potential;apache continuum;approximation;cell (microprocessor);computation;computational complexity theory;discrepancy function;discrete system;duality gap;experiment;simulation;software propagation;triune continuum paradigm;while	Doug Bruce;Pras Pathmanathan;Jonathan P.

When circumscribed with hexagonal rings, disjoint diradicals produce nonradical polycyclic successors and nondisjoint diradicals produce diradical polycyclic successors.

One can find that there is a significant role of Coriolis coupling in reaction dynamics for the ion-molecule collisions of D(+)+H(2), Ne+H(2)(+), and He+H(2)(+) in both adiabatic and nonadiabatic context.	han unification;iontophoresis;quantum dynamics;wave packet;collision	Emilia L.

This technique is based on a twin-grating scheme, in which the measured quantity is obtained from the optical power of convolution between a sensing FBG and a tunable FBG. The proposed interrogator employs a low-voltage monolithic multilayer piezoelectric actuator (MMPA) to sweep the tunable FBG over the wavelength range of the sensing FBG, in order to obtain the convolution function accurately. A dedicated microcontrolled optoelectronic system with a firmware-based tracking routine is responsible for keeping the tunable FBG following the sensing FBG over temperature-induced wavelength shifts with subpicometric resolution, while the dc level of convolution is controlled precisely at the highest sensitivity point of operation. The MMPA employed allows the tracking of the tunable FBG after the sensing FBG over a maximum temperature difference that ranges from -29 °C to +90 °C. The proposed interrogator presents lower cost compared with the systems that employ frequency-scanning devices, such as high-speed Fabry-Perot tunable filters.	convolution;distortion;dynamic range;fits;firmware;matched molecular pair analysis;matthews correlation coefficient;multilayer perceptron;optical fiber;piezoelectricity;sensor	Alex Dante;Rodrigo Moreira Bacurau;Anderson Wedderhoff Spengler;Elnatan Chagas Ferreira;José A.

e741aa8f9fa004e1bfa321bbb66aad0d68583b03	geometry of locomotion of the generalized purcell's swimmer : modelling and controllability		Micro-robotics at low Reynolds number has been a growing area of research over the past decade. We propose and study a generalized 3-link robotic swimmer inspired by the planar Purcell’s swimmer at low Reynolds number. By incorporating out-of-plane motion of the outer limbs, this mechanism generalizes the planar Purcell’s swimmer, which has been widely studied in the literature. Such an evolution of the limbs’ motion results in the swimmer’s base link to evolve in a 3 dimensional space. This swimmer’s configuration space admits a trivial principal fiber bundle structure, which along with the slender body theory at the low Reynolds number regime, facilitates obtaining a kinematic form of the equations. A coordinate-free expression for the local form of the kinematic connection is then derived, followed by a local parametrization for simulation purpose. We then present a local controllability analysis of the swimmer in the low Reynolds number regime using weak controllability results of the planar Purcell’s swimmer.	motion planning;nonlinear system;optimal control;robot;robotics;simulation	Sudin Kadam;Ravi N.

This computationally inexpensive index, derived as a modification of the Mulliken estimation of transition energy for CT excitations, relies on two basic ingredients: an effective CT distance, computed using our density-based index (DCT ), and an orbital weighted estimation of the Ionization Potential and Electron Affinity. Some model systems, representative of both intermolecular and intramolecular CT excitations, were chosen as test cases. The robustness of our approach was verified by analyzing the behavior of functionals belonging to different classes (GGA, global hybrids and range separated hybrids). The results obtained show that ghost states are correctly spotted, also in the delicate case of intramolecular excitations displaying substantial donor-bridge-acceptor delocalization, in a regime for which the standard Mulliken formulation attends its limits. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	acceptor (semiconductors);class;discrete cosine transform;donor-acceptor scheme;electron;functional theories of grammar;hybrids;john d. wiley;molecular orbital;test case;time-dependent density functional theory	Marco Campetella;Federica Maschietto;Mike J.

As an inorganic scintillator for gamma-ray spectroscopy, a cerium-doped lutetium yttrium orthosilicate (LYSO:Ce) crystal was used and two solid-disc type radioactive isotopes with the same dimensions, cesium-137 (Cs-137) and cobalt-60 (Co-60), were used as gamma-ray emitters. We first determined the length of the LYSO:Ce crystal considering the absorption of charged particle energy and measured the gamma-ray energy spectra using the FORS. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed FORS can be used to discriminate species of radioactive isotopes by measuring their inherent energy spectra, even when gamma-ray emitters are mixed. The relationship between the measured photon counts of the FORS and the radioactivity of Cs-137 was subsequently obtained. The amount of scintillating light generated from the FORS increased by increasing the radioactivity of Cs-137. Finally, the performance of the fabricated FORS according to the length and diameter of the POF was also evaluated. Based on the results of this study, it is anticipated that a novel FORS can be developed to accurately measure the gamma-ray energy spectrum in inaccessible locations such as narrow areas and holes.	20-methylcholanthrene;analyzer, device;cerium;charge (electrical);class:type:pt:respiratory analyzer:nom;diameter (qualifier value);dimensions;doping (semiconductor);emi;fiber optic cables;isotopes;optical fiber device component;optics;photomultiplier device component;photomultiplier tube device component;photons;radiation;radioactivity;radioisotopes;reliability engineering;tissue fiber;yttrium;cesium 137;motexafin lutetium;sensor (device)	Wook Jae Yoo;Sang Hun Shin;Dong Eun Lee;Kyoung Won Jang;Seunghyun Cho;Bongsoo Lee	2015		10.3390/s150921265	telecommunications;analytical chemistry;gamma spectroscopy;optics;nuclear magnetic resonance;plastic optical fiber;physics	Embedded	93.33318981931706	-18.208675037096555	43852

A monochromatized X-ray using a crystal spectrometer is passed through a slit (width 25 mm, variable height 25 μm to 2.5 mm), and then irradiated on a rotating sample. The X-ray passed through the sample is converted into an electrical signal by using an X-ray detector with 1024 channels, and then fed into a computer input. This monochromatic X-ray CT has a view field 25 mm in diameter. The CT has an X-ray spectroscopy function and a direct magnifying function of projection using an asymmetrical Bragg reflection, as well as a function for conventional cross-sectional images. This paper describes theoretical analyses of the spatial resolution and noise in reconstructed images which determine the capability of an X-ray CT, and the experimental evaluation of the prototype CT. Theoretically, the spatial resolution is expected to be greater than 25 μm at a magnification of 5, and this agreed with experimental results, as well as the theoretically determined noise in reconstructed images. The prototype apparatus has an energy resolution of 0.1 percent (full width of half maximum) in an energy range of 7 to 40 keV. This makes an absolute-value measurement of the X-ray absorption coefficient possible, and this has been confirmed experimentally. By using this apparatus, it is possible to produce an image quantitatively indicating the distribution of a particular chemical element.	monochrome	Hideki Kohno;Hidemi Shiono;Katsuhisa Usami;Yoshio Suzuki	1990	Systems and Computers in Japan	10.1002/scj.4690210810	iterative reconstruction;synchrotron radiation;image resolution;computer science;monochromator;tomography	NLP	89.26559831910215	-23.370506532713506	43895
e529b3bdc5d00ce188d66551316aedda4607200e	3d-printed electrocardiogram electrodes for heart rate detection in canines		This paper describes the design and fabrication of 3D-printed conductive electrodes for measuring heart rate and heart rate variability in animals. The customizable electrodes have a three-legged stool structure with rounded edges in order to provide optimized, balanced, and comfortable skin contact through the fur of the animal without needing to shave it. We explored two alternative designs for manufacturing: a flexible, insulated base structure coated with graphene for conductivity and a rigid, all-conductive, graphene-infused PLA base structure. To enable connection to standard female electrocardiogram snap connectors, we epoxied the former electrode with a metal male snap connector and the latter electrode had the standard-sized male snap connector 3D printed in one assembly. We characterized and compared the performance of these electrodes through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and benchmarked with commercial electrodes traditionally used in veterinary clinics. Preliminary in vivo results demonstrate the feasibility of these electrodes to measure heart rate and heart rate variability in canine puppies.		Marc Foster;Patrick D. Erb;B.

A theoretical model was first proposed to incorporate vocal fold elongation into the two-mass model. This model predicted the direct and nondirect components of the glottal time series as a function of vocal fold elongation. Furthermore, high-speed digital imaging was applied in excised larynx experiments to visualize vocal fold vibrations with variable vocal fold elongation from -10% to 50% and subglottal pressures of 18- and 24-cm H2O. Comparison between theoretical model simulations and experimental observations showed good agreement. A relative maximum was seen in the nondirect component of glottal area, suggesting that an optimal elongation could maximize the vocal fold vibratory power. However, sufficiently large vocal fold elongations caused the nondirect component to approach zero and the direct component to approach a constant. These results showed that vocal fold elongation plays an important role in governing the dynamics of glottal area movement and validated the applicability of the proposed theoretical model and high-speed imaging to investigate laryngeal activity.	arabic numeral 0;computer simulation;digital imaging;experiment;larynx;maxima and minima;nuchal translucency screen;peptide chain elongation, translational;power (psychology);theory;time series;vibration - physical agent;vocal cord paralysis;vocal cord structure	Yu Zhang;Michael F.

We present a rigorous derivation of a GKLS master equation in the weak-coupling limit for a generic bath, which is not assumed to have a bosonic or fermionic nature, and whose reference state is not necessarily thermal. The crucial assumption is a reservoir state endowed with a mixing property: the n-point connected correlation function of the interaction must be asymptotically bounded by the product of two-point functions (clustering property).

c0a7b575cc13cf0b5d04d396f9635a36d41dc2da	studying the varied shapes of gold clusters by an elegant optimization algorithm that hybridizes the density functional tight-binding theory and the density functional theory		Abstract We combined a new parametrized density functional tight-binding (DFTB) theory (Fihey et al. 2015) with an unbiased modified basin hopping (MBH) optimization algorithm (Yen and Lai 2015) and applied it to calculate the lowest energy structures of Au clusters. From the calculated topologies and their conformational changes, we find that this DFTB/MBH method is a necessary procedure for a systematic study of the structural development of Au clusters but is somewhat insufficient for a quantitative study. As a result, we propose an extended hybridized algorithm. This improved algorithm proceeds in two steps. In the first step, the DFTB theory is employed to calculate the total energy of the cluster and this step (through running DFTB/MBH optimization for given Monte-Carlo steps) is meant to efficiently bring the Au cluster near to the region of the lowest energy minimum since the cluster as a whole has explicitly considered the interactions of valence electrons with ions, albeit semi-quantitatively. Then, in the second succeeding step, the energy-minimum searching process will continue with a skilledly replacement of the energy function calculated by the DFTB theory in the first step by one calculated in the full density functional theory (DFT). In these subsequent calculations, we couple the DFT energy also with the MBH strategy and proceed with the DFT/MBH optimization until the lowest energy value is found. We checked that this extended hybridized algorithm successfully predicts the twisted pyramidal structure for the Au 40 cluster and correctly confirms also the linear shape of C 8 which our previous DFTB/MBH method failed to do so. Perhaps more remarkable is the topological growth of Au n : it changes from a planar ( n =3–11) → an oblate-like cage ( n =12–15) → a hollow-shape cage ( n =16–18) and finally a pyramidal-like cage ( n =19, 20). These varied forms of the cluster’s shapes are consistent with those reported in the literature.	algorithm;density functional theory;functional theories of grammar;mathematical optimization;tight binding	Tsung-Wen Yen;Thong Leng Lim;Tiem Leong Yoon;S.

e547f092c7958dc7f3ec3750796ad69ea976bae1	assessment of sense measurement duration on bti degradation in mg/hk cmos technologies using a novel stacked transistor test structure		Abstract The impact of sense measurement duration on BTI degradation in MG/HK devices is assessed by adapting a novel stacked transistor test structure in combination with a multiple drain current sensing scheme in the μs and ms time range. For NBTI, a fast de-trapping component causes dispersion in the DC time evolution for the different sense measurement duration but only at short stress times. However, at long stress times, relevant for lifetime projections, the impact diminishes. For PBTI and AC stress, the sense measurement duration is not a contributing factor. For technology qualifications where prolonged stresses are exercised, sense duration in the μs and ms time range yield equivalent model parameters.	btrieve;cmos;elegant degradation;mg (editor);transistor	Andreas Kerber	2017	Microelectronics Reliability	10.1016/j.microrel.2017.05.003	electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;forensic engineering	EDA	90.67862219838202	-11.715166335501168	44821

The actuator was fabricated by means of thin-film piezoelectric MEMS technology and was employed for modifying the micro-membrane curvature, in view of its application in micro-optic devices, such as variable focus micro-lenses. We are here showing that OLCR incorporating a near-infrared superluminescent light emitting diode as the read-out source is suitable for measuring various parameters such as the micro-membrane optical path-length, the membrane displacement as a function of the applied voltage (yielding the piezo-actuator hysteresis) as well as the resonance curve of the fundamental vibration mode. The use of an optical source with short coherence-time allows performing interferometric measurements without spurious resonance effects due to multiple parallel interfaces of highly planar slabs, furthermore selecting the plane/layer to be monitored. We demonstrate that the same compact and flexible setup can be successfully employed to perform spot optical measurements for static and dynamic characterization of piezo-MEMS in real time.	actuator device component;displacement mapping;eye;fiberoptic device component;hysteresis;light emitting diode device component;medication event monitoring system;microelectromechanical systems;normal mode;optical fiber;piezoelectricity;preparation;psychologic displacement;reflectometry;resonance;tissue membrane;voltage	Sabina Merlo;Paolo Poma;Eleonora Crisà;Dino Faralli;Marco Soldo	2017		10.3390/s17030462	electronic engineering;nondestructive testing;analytical chemistry;optics	Vision	91.69051062445826	-19.814115449513316	44826

One of the drawbacks of this system is the connecting wire that leads from the eye coil to the associated electronics; this wire causes irritation to the subject and has a tendency to break during experiments. We have developed a modified version of this technique, which uses a resonant scleral coil and no connecting wire. A transmitter sends a stream of pulses to the eye coil, and a receiver then detects the resonant oscillations re-radiated from the eye coil. The relative intensity of the signal as received by sets of orthogonal receiver coils determines the orientation of the eye coil. The new approach retains the advantages of accuracy, precision, and high sample rate, while making the system portable and more comfortable.	experiment;sampling (signal processing);transmitter	Dale Roberts;Mark Shelhamer;Aaron Wong	2008		10.1145/1344471.1344519	telecommunications;engineering;optics;engineering drawing	HCI	89.00775195085622	-21.845890698589947	45003

The seedless grown ZnO nanorods were characterised by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The characterised seedless ZnO nanorods in 3D on nickel foam were highly dense, perpendicular to substrate, grown along the (002) crystal plane, and also composed of single crystal. In addition to this, these seedless ZnO nanorods were functionalized with trans-dinitro-dibenzo-18-6 crown ether, a selective iron (III) ion ionophore, along with other components of membrane composition such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC), 2-nitopentylphenyl ether as plasticizer (NPPE), and tetrabutyl ammonium tetraphenylborate (TBATPB) as conductivity increaser. The sensor electrode has shown high linearity with a wide range of detection of iron (III) ion concentrations from 0.005 mM to 100 mM. The low limit of detection of the proposed ion selective electrode was found to be 0.001 mM. The proposed sensor also described high storage stability, selectivity, reproducibility, and repeatability and a quick response time of less than 10 s.	copper(ii) chloride;crown group;field electron emission;guilty gear xrd;image resolution;repeatability;response time (technology);selectivity (electronic);sensor;source-to-source compiler;usability	Mazhar Ali Abbasi;Zafar Hussain Ibupoto;Yaqoob Khan;Azam Khan;Omer Nur;Magnus Willander	2013	J.

The percentage shrinkages due to different shapes are investigated and their empirical relationship is determined. A new speed-compensation (SC) method is proposed to reduce uneven shrinkage affected by the two-dimensional geometric shape at each layer. From case studies conducted, the optimized SC method is found to be efficient in improving the accuracy of prototypes fabricated. Note to Practitioners-This paper aims to address the problem of dimensional errors of parts built by the direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) process. Existing compensation approaches are normally based on a general relationship between the nominal dimensions and the errors after sintering. However, the effect arising from different geometric shapes is not considered. A new approach is proposed using different scan speed settings to compensate for the effect of geometric shapes to improve the dimensional accuracy of the entire part. During processing, the laser sinters along the trajectory are guided by the hatch vectors or dexel. An appropriate experimental method is used to establish the relationship for different scan speeds with the dexel length to the final accuracy. When building the part, the laser scan speed is adjusted dynamically according to the dexel length which varies with the geometric shape of the part. The case study demonstrates that the proposed method can generate correct speed settings to effectively increase the dimensional accuracy of the final part. Although this method has been developed based on the DMLS process, it is also applicable to other laser sintering processes. In future research, other process parameters, such as laser power, will be considered independently, or together with the scan speed, for possible further improvement on the dimensional accuracy.	experiment	Yuanxing Ning;Yoke San Wong;Jerry Y.

Here, the development of systems for application of those sorbents to in situ monitoring is described. Considerations such as column pressure, particulate filtration, and component durability are discussed. The diameter of selected column housings, the sorbent bed depth, and the frits utilized significantly impact the utility of the sorbent columns in the prototype system. The impact of and necessity for improvements in the morphological characteristics of the sorbents as they relate to reduction in column pressure are detailed.

We show that in the limit of slow synaptic interactions in the continuum limit the dynamics reduce to those of the standard Amari model. For non-slow synaptic connections we are able to go beyond the standard firing rate analysis of localized solutions allowing us to explicitly construct a family of co-existing one-bump solutions, and then track bump width and firing pattern as a function of system parameters. We also present an analysis of the model on a discrete lattice. We show that multiple width bump states can co-exist and uncover a mechanism for bump wandering linked to the speed of synaptic processing. Moreover, beyond a wandering transition point we show that the bump undergoes an effective random walk with a diffusion coefficient that scales exponentially with the rate of synaptic processing and linearly with the lattice spacing.	bump mapping;coefficient;interaction;lattice constant;network model;population;spiking neural network;synapse;synaptic package manager;thermal copper pillar bump;triune continuum paradigm	Carson C.

The communication line is based on the optimized boundary-controlled chain with two pairs of properly adjusted coupling constants. We show that the communication line can be characterized by a set of parameters independent of the initial state of the sender. These parameters are permanent attributes of a communication line and can be either calculated theoretically or measured in experiment. In particular, they determine the creatable subregion of the receiver's state space. The creation of a particular state within the creatable region is achieved by a proper choice of the independent parameters of the sender's initial state (control parameters) and reduces to the solvability of a certain system of algebraic equations. The creation of the two-qubit Werner state is considered as an example. We also study the effects of imperfections of the chain on the state creation.	qubit	Joachim Stolze;A. I.

The theoretical analysis considers two types of diodes: diodes with short base and diodes with long base and the magnetic field is assumed to be perpendicular to the direction of the electric current across the junction. The results show that the variation of the current is directly related to the variation of the hole diffusion coefficient, which is then calculated in the approximation of a P-type silicon material. The relative variation of the diffusion coefficient was found  B  2  dependent. Experimental investigations have then been carried out in order to validate the theoretical calculations. The experimental results were in good agreement with the theoretical development when taking into account the two types of holes in the diffusion mechanism in silicon.		M. Idrissi-Benzohra;M.

The grain growth direction is measured by image processing software after a cyclic loading test for various biaxial stress ratios is carried out. Since the grain growth occurs in two directions and its directions correspond closely with the direction of maximum shearing stress when the biaxial stress ratio is negative, the principal stress can be measured using Mohr’s stress circle. On the other hand, when the biaxial stress ratio is positive, above-mentioned feature does not occur. Therefore, the first principal stress can be measured based on the grain growth density. The number of grains necessary to measure the biaxial stress is estimated by a statistical approach.	birefringence;image processing;stress ball	Yuichi Ono;Cheng Li;Daisuke Hino	2010	EURASIP J. Adv.

The proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyzer is characterized by high energy efficiency, high yield, simple system and low operating temperature. The electrolyzer generates hydrogen from water free of any carbon sources (provided the electrons come from renewable sources such as solar and wind), so it is very clean and completely satisfies the environmental requirement. However, in long-term operation of the PEM water electrolyzer, the membrane material durability, catalyst corrosion and nonuniformity of local flow, voltage and current in the electrolyzer can influence the overall performance. It is difficult to measure the internal physical parameters of the PEM water electrolyzer, and the physical parameters are interrelated. Therefore, this study uses micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology to develop a flexible integrated microsensor; internal multiple physical information is extracted to determine the optimal working parameters for the PEM water electrolyzer. The real operational data of local flow, voltage and current in the PEM water electrolyzer are measured simultaneously by the flexible integrated microsensor, so as to enhance the performance of the PEM water electrolyzer and to prolong the service life.	corrosion of medical device material;diagram;durability (database systems);electrons;embedded system;embedding;extraction;hydrogen;medication event monitoring system;microelectromechanical systems;physical information;protons;real-time clock;record sealing;sensor;tissue membrane;viral capsid secondary envelopment;voltage	Chi-Yuan Lee;Shih-Chun Li;Chia-Hung Chen;Yen-Ting Huang;Yu-Syuan Wang	2018		10.3390/s18030867	renewable energy;electronic engineering;hydrogen fuel;proton exchange membrane fuel cell;electrolysis;engineering;voltage;efficient energy use;service life;operating temperature	EDA	92.29895462630247	-17.57376843131454	45843

Comput. Phys. 223 (2007) 846-864], this paper further extends the FMM to the electrostatic calculation for charges inside a dielectric sphere immersed in an ionic solvent, a scenery with more relevance in biological applications. The key findings include two fourth-order multiple discrete image approximations in terms of u=λa to the reaction field induced by the ionic solvent, provided that u=λa < 1 where λ is the inverse Debye screening length of the ionic solvent and a is the radius of the dielectric sphere. A 10(-4) relative accuracy in the reaction field of a source charge within the sphere can be achieved with only 3-4 point image charges. Together with the image charges, the FMM can be used to speed up the calculation of electrostatic interactions of charges in a dielectric sphere immersed in an ionic solvent.	approximation;bone structure of radius;fast multipole method;interaction;ionic;ka band;relevance;antineoplaston a10;newton	Shaozhong Deng;Wei Cai	2007	Journal of computational physics	10.1016/j.jcp.2007.09.001	debye length;calculation;fast multipole method;multipole expansion;spheres;point particle;method of images;physics;quantum mechanics;sphere;method of image charges	Vision	96.03417006488704	-5.594101867441499	46285

According to the results of the research, the flexible rotor center is found to include a complex dynamic behavior that comprises periodic, sub-harmonic and quasi-periodic responses. In addition, as the rotor mass and the bearing number are increased, there will be some changes taking place in the dynamic behavior of the bearing system. The results are proven to have no conflict with those of the other numerical methods, which enables an effective means in gaining insights into the nonlinear dynamics of HSSAB systems.	hard disk drive;newton's method;numerical method	Cheng Chi Wang;Her-Terng Yau	2010	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2010.07.008	mathematical analysis;simulation;complex dynamics;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;finite difference method;calculus;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	84.0732424509071	-1.7293567133400196	46355

The SAW atomizer is small and light-weighted, attractive for many applications, especially for pulmonary drug delivery and biomicrofluidics. Control the sizes of the aerosols generated by SAW is crucial for successful applications. Unlike the theory applied and published in many SAW atomization works—the size of the aerosol can be tuned by manipulating the driving frequency; —we however found the aerosol size is irrelevant to the driving frequency, but governed by the capillary vibration frequency given by the balance between the acoustic forcing and capillary stress. The self-pumping effect of SAW, on the other hand, leads to the design of a disposable pump-free liquid supply system, which is able to deliver liquids to atomizer automatically for continuous atomization.	acoustic cryptanalysis;pumping (computer systems);relevance	Aisha Qi;James R.

At increasingly larger values of a control parameter of heavy hydrocarbon-oxygen mixtures, the steady, uniform, annular front is replaced by a sequence of time-dependent states in which bright spots, highly localized regions of optical emission, move rapidly around the annulus. These particle-like objects appear spontaneously, individually, or in counterpropagating pairs, move in either direction, collide, and annihilate. A high speed camera equipped with a microchannel plate image intensifier is used to record this > 35 Hz motion. Video sequences of these states are embedded in this presentation in order to demonstrate how the nonperiodic nature of this dynamics evolves at increasing values of the driving parameter. Our results are compared with the findings of numerical studies by Bayliss and Matkowsky on solid fuel combustion in an annular geometry.	embedded system;fractal flame;microchannel plate detector;numerical analysis;traffic enforcement camera	Michael Gorman;Robert Brockman	2009	SIAM J.

The two levels are of the same performance and both are sufficient for molecules of this type according to comparison with scarce experimental gas-phase acidities and basicities. The substituent effects were analyzed in terms of isodesmic equations. In addition to strong dependence on the substituent inductive effect, a slight dependence on the electronegativity of the first atom of the substituent was proven in certain cases. In all aspects, there is no qualitative difference between the effects on radicals and on similar closed shell species. Radicals behave as slightly electron deficient; the substituent effect is weaker than that on the ions but stronger than on neutral molecules.

To immobilize a TNT analogue on the polymer, mono-2-(methacryloyloxy)ethylsuccinate (MES), which has a carboxyl group, was used in this study. However, the anti-TNT antibody may adsorb non-specifically on the polymer surface by an electrostatic interaction because MES is negatively charged. Therefore, a mixed monomer with MES and diethylaminoethylmethacrylate (DEAEM), which has a tertiary amino group and is positively charged, was prepared to obtain electroneutrality for suppressing the nonspecific adsorption. The detection of TNT was performed by inhibition assay using the polymer surface. To ensure high sensitivity to TNT, the affinity between the surface and the antibody was optimized by controlling the density of the initiator for ATRP by mixing two types of self-assembled monolayer reagents. As a result, a limit of detection of 5.7 pg/mL (ppt) for TNT was achieved using the optimized surface.	amino acid metabolism, inborn errors;analog;atom;carboxyl group;charge (electrical);international system of units;manufacturing execution system;meckel syndrome type 1;polymer;processor affinity;reagents;scsi initiator and target;self-assembled monolayer;surface plasmon resonance;tree rearrangement;monomer;tertiary	Rui Yatabe;Takeshi Onodera;Kiyoshi Toko	2013		10.3390/s130709294	surface plasmon resonance;transducer;analytical chemistry;self-assembled monolayer;organic chemistry;nanotechnology;terrorism;physics	Vision	95.3636857744951	-17.194389253337775	46611

To investigate how the field presence affects transitions between the conformational states of a protein, we report 16 independent 40 ns-trajectories of A21 starting from both extended and fully folded states. We observe folding-behavior of the peptide consistent with prior simulation and experimental studies. The peptide displays a natural tendency to form stable elements of secondary structure which are stabilized by tertiary interactions with proximate regions of the peptide. Consistent with our earlier work, the presence of external e/m fields disrupts this behavior, involving a mechanism of localized dipolar alignment which serves to enhance intra-protein perturbations in hydrogen bonds (English, et al., J. Chem. Phys. 2010, 133, 091105), leading to more frequent transitions between shorter-lifetime states.	alanine;electroconvulsive therapy;electromagnetic phenomena;equilibrium;hydrogen;interaction;molecular dynamics;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;simulation;staphylococcal protein a;microwave electromagnetic radiation;polyalanine;polyalanine, (d)-isomer;tertiary	Gleb Y.

The ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra indicated that DDTC formed a complex with Cu2+, showing a prominent peak at ~450 nm. We found Raman spectral changes in DDTC from ~1490 cm-1 to ~1504 cm-1 on AuNPs at a high concentration of Cu2+ above 1 μM. The other ions of Zn2+, Pb2+, Ni2+, NH₄⁺, Mn2+, Mg2+, K⁺, Hg2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Cr3+, Co2+, Cd2+, and Ca2+ did not produce such spectral changes, even after they reacted with DDTC. The electroplating industrial wastewater samples were tested under the interference of highly concentrated ions of Fe3+, Ni2+, and Zn2+. The Raman spectroscopy-based quantification of Cu2+ ions was able to be achieved for the wastewater after treatment with alkaline chlorination, whereas the cyanide-containing water did not show any spectral changes, due to the complexation of the cyanide with the Cu2+ ions. A micromolar range detection limit of Cu2+ ions could be achieved by analyzing the Raman spectra of DDTC in the cyanide-removed water.	alkaline phosphatase;calcium ion;concentrate dosage form;cyanides;diethyldithiocarbamate;ditiocarb;electroplating;ferric;ferrous;hepatitis b surface antigens;industrial pc;interference (communication);ions;manganese cation (2+);mercury 2+;micromole/liter;ni2+;pb2+;quantitation;raman scattering;spectroscopy, near-infrared;chromic cation;cobaltous cation;cupric cation;zinc cation	Nguyen Hoàng Ly;Thanh Danh Nguyen;Kyung-Duk Zoh;Sang Woo Joo	2017		10.3390/s17112628	raman spectroscopy;absorption spectroscopy;cyanide;analytical chemistry;surface-enhanced raman spectroscopy;detection limit;copper;qualitative inorganic analysis;colloidal gold;chemistry;inorganic chemistry	AI	96.14792400925732	-17.103045840952348	46704

In order to gain new insights into the drilling process, a novel experimental setup is being developed in order to record all cutting force components (cutting force, feed force, passive force). The results show that the force components are strongly dependent on the fiber cutting angle θ and the wear condition. Thereby, it will be possible to draw conclusions about the cutting mechanics in the drilling of unidirectional CFRP based on the transformation of the forces perpendicular and parallel to the fiber.	experiment	Wolfgang Hintze;Rolf Clausen;Christoph Schütte;Kristoffer Kroll	2018	Production Engineering	10.1007/s11740-018-0807-2	manufacturing engineering;fiber;machining;drilling;engineering;composite material	SE	86.07731842328343	-14.746036505831857	46857

Two reaction pathways were considered: the direct and water-assisted transfers. The optimized structures and thermodynamic properties of stationary points for the title reaction system in the gas phase were calculated at the B3LYP/6-311+G(d, p) level of theory. The potential energy profiles along the minimum energy path in the gas phase and in water were obtained. The study of the solvent effect of water on the proton transfer of 2-amino-2-oxozoline, 2-amino-2-thiazoline, and 2-amino-2-imidazoline indicates that water as a solvent is favorable for the water-assisted process and slows down the rate of the direct transfer pathway.

Compared with the OFET sensors without synergistic effect, the fabricated OFET sensors showed a remarkable shift of saturation current, field-effect mobility and threshold voltage when exposed to various concentrations of NO₂ analyte. Moreover, after being stored in atmosphere for 30 days, the variation of saturation current increased more than 10 folds at 0.5 ppm NO₂. By analyzing the electrical characteristics, and the morphologies of organic semiconductor films of the OFET-based sensors, the performance enhancement was ascribed to the synergistic effect of the dielectric and organic semiconductor. The ZnO nanoparticles on PMMA dielectric surface decreased the grain size of pentacene formed on hybrid dielectric, facilitating the diffusion of CuPc molecules into the grain boundary of pentacene and the approach towards the conducting channel of OFET. Hence, NO₂ molecules could interact with CuPc and ZnO nanoparticles at the interface of dielectric and organic semiconductor. Our results provided a promising strategy for the design of high performance OFET-based NO₂ sensors in future electronic nose and environment monitoring.	behavior;effective method;electron mobility;electronic nose;greater than;heterojunction;interface device component;ions;methacrylates;methylmethacrylate;ploidies;polymethyl methacrylate;relative change and difference;semiconductor;sulfur dioxide;synergy;tachycardia, ventricular;transistor device component;zinc oxide;analyte;part per million (ppm);pentacene;sensor (device)	Shijiao Han;Jiang Cheng;Huidong Fan;Junsheng Yu;Lu Li	2016		10.3390/s16101763	electronic engineering;optoelectronics	Mobile	92.82194658897963	-14.246038827377019	46864
10a545835dadca92eb9e3103eb5fe149c8b56597	application of computer simulation techniques to macromolecular theories	computer simulation	A computer simulation method is suggested as a technique for the verification of molecular theories. The method is applied ta a three-bead-two-rod model commonly used for modeling polymer molecules. A discrete model is developed and an algorithm for the generation of an equilibrium probability distribution function for the angle between the two rods is formulated. The results tend to support the predictions of equilibrium statistical mechanics when formutated with constraints, rather than the predictions of random walk statistics when constraints are not included in the initial formulation. INTRODUCTION Very often in the process of developing molecular theories, different theoretical approaches are suggested leading to contradicting results. In this work, we suggest the use of computer simulation methods as a way to verify qualitatively the correctness of predictions made by molecular theories for polymeric liquids. The method is ilIustrated by application to a freely-jointed bead-rod model.* The importance of this particular model is discussed in detail elsewhere (Gottlieb & Bird, 1976). The freely-jointed bead-rod model (or ‘pearl necklace model’) was used by Kramers (1444) to describe viscosity and birefringence of dilute polymer solutions. It was shown by him that the equilibrium configuration distribution involves a correlation between the orientations of adjacent links in the model. This result was ignored by later workers (Rivlin, 1949; Glory, 1953) who preferred to apply the random walk approach which, of course, is in conflict with the idea of preferred orientations. The two methods used to approach the problem were summarized by Fixman (1974): (a) The momenta conjugate to the constrained coordinates are ignored and this procedure gives rise to additional coupling between the remaining coordinates. (b) The constraints are not included in the initial formulation of the problem, but introduced in a later stage by means of ‘freezing out’ the appropriate degrees of freedom. In this method the momenta conjugate to the frozen coordinates are not ignored. The use of method (b), adopted by Flory (1953. lY74), Bird et al. (1969), and Fixman & Kovac (lY74), does not include, due to the redundant conjugate momenta, the correlation between the orientation of neighboring links calculated by Kramers. The correlation and the physical implications from using method (a) were discussed in detail bv GB t Scheraaa (1969). Recently it was shown bv Hassager (1974), usingm&hoi (a), that-for a three-beadtwo-rod model the probability that the angle between the two links has a value between x and x + dX is:	algorithm;birefringence;computer simulation;correctness (computer science);emoticon;polymer;theory	Moshe Gottlieb	1977	Computers & Chemistry	10.1016/0097-8485(77)85004-3	computer simulation;statistical physics;biology;chemistry;computer science;theoretical computer science;computational physics	AI	94.67342011283446	-1.5869734603918413	47000

The physical characterization has been linked with modeling of thin-film transistor structures whereby a defect state based model has been employed to explain the transport mechanisms within the film.

c03442b3feb9e7739f79b982ba2f250b8ace0f7f	visualization of flow instabilities in supersonic ejectors using large eddy simulation	flow instabilities;ejector;les simulation	Ejectors are flow devices of rugged and simple construction, usually made up of two coaxial nozzles. They are used in a large variety of applications including vacuum pump, thermocompressor, thrust augmentation systems, hydrogen recirculation in fuel cell. However, ejectors involve very complex flows which have been the object of many numerical and experimental studies in the recent past years. These studies related mainly to the analysis of the shocks pressure recovery (Gaurav Singhal et al. 2010), the interaction and the mixing process between the primary and secondary flows (Yang et al. 2012) and the possible condensation which may occur in these supersonic flow devices. Many of the studies on ejectors have highlighted the relation between the ejector flow regime and the ejector performance in terms of vacuum and flow entrainment capacities (Hemidi et al. 2009). Knowledge of the flow pattern in ejectors is therefore essential and flow visualization techniques have been very useful to classify the flow in different flow regimes according to the choking or not of the flow in the secondary nozzle and to validate CFD simulations of the flow (Desevaux et al. 2013). Instabilities can also occur in ejector flows, being able to have a significant impact on the ejector performance, in particular on its mixing capacity (Murakami and Papamoschou 2001). These flow instabilities were sometimes visualized in experiments (Murakami and Papamoschou 2001), seldom numerically. The objective of this paper is to propose a CFD simulation of the flow using the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and to show its capability to numerically highlight the flow instabilities in a supersonic air–air ejector which were experimentally visualized in a previous work in our laboratory (Desevaux 1994).

2b6012bd1da8530e3ff0597740cb91c4f2c3e9f6	a curvature smooth lofting scheme for singular point treatments	tensor product lofting;singular point	This paper presents a new end condition scheme for lofting through singular points, one that is easily specified and can generate shapes that are appropriate for lofting to the noses of subsonic/transonic aerodynamic and some hydrodynamic crafts. A degeneracy in the tensor product parameterization is typical in representations of spheres and ellipsoids, or topological equivalents. In that case a grid of data typically sets a whole row to a single value, so it becomes difficult and cumbersome to specify shape characteristics in different directions emanating from that point. Some standardly used end conditions result in shapes that are (C^0) at the singular point, an undesirable outcome in nose regions of subsonic aircraft, so the straightforward nose-to-tail lofts are intractable for these vehicles. The proposed method overcomes this problem (See Figs. 1 and 2 for examples).		Elaine Cohen;Robert Haimes;Richard F.

The system harvests strain energy from a vibrating structure and convert it into usable electrical energy for powering sensors and a wireless communication node. Typical in-flight vibration frequency and strain levels on the bottom side of the aircraft wing's root were investigated for testing the performance of the system. Major concerns of the implemented system are the amount of harvested power, in the usable range of milliwatts, and the low power consumption energy-flow management for data sensing and transmitting. Such results arise from the use of flexible piezoelectric macro-fiber composite (MFC) bonded as energy generator to both an aluminum and a composite substrate, and from the integration of a new Energy-Aware Interface (EAI). The harvested power is between 0.5-12 mW under low and non-resonant vibrations of 2.5-10 Hz and 480-1170 μstrain peak-to-peak. The waiting time between two consecutive transmissions was measured around 0.4 s under 1170 μstrain peak-to-peak excitation at 10 Hz. Such achievement shows strong capability to approach self-powered continuous monitoring. The system has potential of being used to harvest strain energy from the vibrations of aircraft in active service for powering an on-board wireless sensing node for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM).	autonomous robot;enterprise application integration;microsoft foundation class library;on-board data handling;piezoelectricity;sensor;super high material cd;transmitter	Alessandro Giuliano;Vlad Marsic;Meiling Zhu	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Green Computing and Communications	10.1109/GreenCom.2012.110	structural engineering;embedded system;electronic engineering;engineering	Robotics	90.99543756400276	-18.313082538386396	47304

A simple interpretation of bidirectional molecular dynamics is given.

In dynamic random-access memory devices (DRAM), the data are stored as the presence or absence of minority carrier charges on storage capacitors. For example, in n-channel MOS memory devices, the charge carriers are electrons and the capacitors are potential wells in the p-type silicon. Alpha particles emitted from trace levels of uranium and thorium in the packaging materials can penetrate the surface of the semiconductor die. As the alpha particle passes through the semiconductor device, electrons an dislodged from the crystal lattice sites along the track of the alpha particle. If the total number of generated electrons collected by an empty storage well exceeds the number of electrons that differentiates between a 1 and a 0, the collected electron charge can flip a 1 to a 0 generating a soft error in the memory device. The trend toward increased chip density, smaller device dimensions, and lower voltages further increases the susceptibility of DRAM to soft errors. The susceptibility of DRAM to soft errors is typically measured by accelerated tests or real-time SER tests, each of which have strengths and weaknesses. Knowledge of the factors which lead to soft errors can be used to improve reliability in DRAM by using a physics-of-failure approach to monitor variables in the manufacturing process resulting in building reliability into the manufacturing process.	soft error	Leon Lantz	1996	IEEE Trans.

The values of torque, torque ripple, iron and magnet losses are calculated using a FEM program. It is concluded that the optimal magnet coverage can only be found by extensive investigations for each specific machine. However, an estimate value of magnet coverage can be found from recommendations and formulas, including only the number of phases and the number of slots per pole per phase. It is shown that by investigating each individual machine for a magnet coverage between 0.7-0.9, the torque ripple can be reduced up to 40% and magnet loss can be reduced up to 28%.	finite element method;mathematical optimization;ripple effect;thickness (graph theory)	Poopak Roshanfekr;Sonja Lundmark;Torbjörn Thiringer;Mikael Alatalo	2014	IECON 2014 - 40th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2014.7048552	electropermanent magnet;electronic engineering;permanent magnet synchronous generator;electrical engineering;pole piece;nuclear magnetic resonance;direct torque control	Robotics	85.12376893070537	-13.239677967600791	47524

Two point velocity correlations in these jets revealed the extent and orientation of the large scale structures in the major and minor planes. The spatial filtering of the instantaneous velocity field using Gaussian convolution kernel shows that while a single large vortex ring circumscribing the jet seems to be present at the exit of nozzle, the orifice jet exhibited a number of smaller vortex ring pairs close to jet exit. The smaller length scale observed in the case of the orifice jet is representative of the smaller azimuthal vortex rings that generate axial vortex field as they are convected. This results in the axis-switching in the case of orifice jet and may have a mechanism different from the self induction process as observed in the case of contoured nozzle jet flow.	convolution;experiment;near field communication;optic axis of a crystal;taylor–green vortex;turbulence;velocity (software development)	G.

In these cases, forced internal air cooling, for instance by the use of fans, is nearly impossible. However, in the same time, permanent magnet machines have to expel their internal rotor losses. In this context, an accurate estimate of heat exchange transfers and heat sources are important, for instance for the determination of the temperature distribution. This can be used for future designs of the same type of machine. This paper details the thermal modeling of a totally enclosed permanent magnet machine, such as an integrated starter generator (ISG). For this purpose, a lumped parameter network is built. Thermal conduction, convection and radiation heat transfer modes are considered. Losses are calculated using both analytical expressions and (coupled) electromagnetic finite element analysis (FEA). Simulation results are compared and validated with experimental data.

The purpose of this study was to realize more pliable endoscopes which can be actively operated by using a shape memory alloy (SMA). First, the characteristics of an SMA as an actuator are clarified in this paper. For this purpose, four variables of temperature, stress, strain, and electrical resistance are measured simultaneously on SMA coil spring samples. Subsequently, a new method is introduced to express the measured characteristics, and temperature-stress diagrams are drawn so that conditions of optimal use and heat-processing can be determined for using SMA as actuators from the viewpoint of phase transition. Based on analytical techniques, the resistance feedback characteristic is enhanced and the fatigue problem resulting from thermal irregularities is overcome. Ultimately, based on the thus-obtained findings on SMA, a second-phase test model of the active endoscope with optimized characteristics is designed and assembled to demonstrate the feasibility of shift control with sufficient manoeuvrability under stable resistance feedback. The theoretical studies and demonstration indicate the feasibility of positive endoscopes in practical applications.	diagram;tesla coil	Shigeo Hirose;Koji Ikuta;Masahiro Tsukamoto	1989	Advanced Robotics	10.1163/156855390X00026	phase transition;design;simulation;exploration;engineering;metal;engineering drawing;instrumentation;actuator;mechanical engineering	HCI	85.90225063393973	-14.758725761528984	47651

Peristalsis of SWCNTs suspended in water through an asymmetric channel is examined. Such mechanism is studied in the presence of viscous dissipation, velocity slip, mixed convection, temperature jump and heat generation/absorption.   METHODS Mathematical modeling is carried out under the low Reynolds number and long wavelength approximation. Resulting nonlinear system is solved using the perturbation technique for small Brinkman's number. Physical analysis and comparison of the results in light of three different thermal conductivity models is also provided.   CONCLUSIONS It is reported that the heat transfer rate at the boundary increases with an increase in the nanotubes volume fraction. The addition of nanotubes affects the pressure gradient during the peristaltic flow. Moreover, the maximum velocity of the fluid decreases due to addition of the nanotubes.

No. WO98/16010 PCT Pub. Date Apr. 16, 1998An improved charge pump design is disclosed. This charge pump comprises at least one pumping transistor having a triple well arrangement. This triple pump transistor has a source and a drain region of a first conductive type formed on a first well having an opposite conductive type. A second well having the first conductive type is formed outside of the first well. The source region, first well and second well are set to substantially the same potential. One aspect of this configuration is that the first well forms a semiconductor diode with the drain region. Another aspect of this arrangement is that the body effect of the transistor is reduced. The reduction in body effect reduces the threshold voltage of the transistor. It is found that the above mentioned diode and threshold voltage reduction, singly and in combination, allow the charge pump to operate more efficiently.	fama–french three-factor model	Ralitsa Petkova	2009		10.1007/978-0-387-30440-3_203	financial economics;stock exchange;economics;finance;post-earnings-announcement drift;financial system	NLP	92.15800457629122	-12.59816343053671	47690

In order to get a better understanding of the relationship between glacial loading/unloading and fault movement due to the spatio-temporal evolution of stresses, a commonly used model for glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) is extended by including a fault structure. Solving this problem is enabled by development of a workflow involving three cascaded finite-element simulations. Each step has identical lithospheric and mantle structure and properties, but evolving stress conditions along the fault. The purpose of the first simulation is to compute the spatio-temporal evolution of rebound stress when the fault is tied together. An ice load with a parabolic profile and simple ice history is applied to represent glacial loading of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. The results of the first step describes the evolution of the stress and displacement induced by the rebound process. The second step in the procedure augments the results of the first, by computing the spatio-temporal evolution of total stress (i. e. rebound stress plus tectonic background Preprint submitted to Computers & Geosciences 30 May 2013 stress and overburden pressure) and displacement with reaction forces that can hold the model in equilibrium. The background stress is estimated by assuming that the fault is in frictional equilibrium before glaciation. The third steps simulates fault movement induced by the spatio-temporal evolution of total stress by evaluating fault stability in a subroutine. If the fault remains stable, no movement occurs; in case of fault instability, the fault displacement is computed. We show an example of fault motion along a 45-dipping fault at the ice-sheet centre for a two-dimensional model. Stable conditions along the fault are found during glaciation and the initial part of deglaciation. Before deglaciation ends, the fault starts to move, and fault offsets of up to 22 m are obtained. A fault scarp at the surface of 19.74 m is determined. The fault is stable in the following time steps with a high stress accumulation at the fault tip. Along the upper part of the fault, GIA stresses are released in one earthquake.		Rebekka Steffen;Patrick Wu;Holger Steffen;David W.

Without using excitation and induction coils, the sensor mainly consists of a static magnetization unit made of permanent magnets and a magnetic field measurement unit containing Hall element arrays. Firstly, the principle is illustrated in detail. Under the excitation of the magnetization unit, a spatially varying magnetized region in the steel wire is utilized as the measurement region. Radial and axial magnetic flux densities at different lift-offs in this region are measured by the measurement unit to calculate the differential permeability curve and magnetization curve. Feature parameters extracted from the curves are used to evaluate the axial stress. Secondly, the special stress sensor for Φ5 and Φ7 steel wires is developed accordingly. At last, the performance of the sensor is tested experimentally. Experimental results show that the sensor can measure the magnetization curve accurately with the error in the range of ±6%. Furthermore, the obtained differential permeability at working points 1200 A/m and 10000 A/m change almost linearly with the stress in steel wires, the goodness of linear fits are all higher than 0.987. Thus, the proposed steel wire stress measuring sensor is feasible.	excitation;experiment;extraction;fits;flux;magnet <device>;magnetic resonance imaging;radial (radio);sensor;steel;wire wrap;density	Dongge Deng;Xinjun Wu;Su Zuo	2016		10.3390/s16101650	magnet;nuclear magnetic resonance;forensic engineering;engineering drawing;physics;quantum mechanics	Robotics	90.02804398101827	-19.49818020628335	48009

There are many different ways of determining the optical properties of turbid media. The paper describes measurements of the optical properties of porcine brain tissue using novel instrumentation for simultaneous absorption and scattering characterisation of small turbid samples. Integrating sphere measurements are widely used as a reference method for determination of the optical properties of relatively thin turbid samples. However, this technique is associated with bulky equipment, complicated measuring techniques, interference compensation techniques and inconvenient sample handling. It is believed that the sphere for some applications can be replaced by a new, compact device, called the combined angular and spatially resolved head sensor, to measure the optical properties of thin turbid samples. The results compare very well with data obtained with an integrating sphere for well-defined samples. The instrument was shown to be accurate to within 12% for μa and 1% for μ s ′ in measurements of intralipid-ink samples. The corresponding variations of data were 17% and 2%, respectively. The reduced scattering coefficient for porcine white matter was measured to be 100 cm−1 at 633 nm, and the value for coagulated brain tissue was 65 cm−1. The corresponding absorption coefficients were 2 and 3 cm−1, respectively.	angularjs;body tissue;clotting time:time:pt:bld:qn:lee white;coefficient;handling (psychology);ink (substance);instrument - device;interference (communication);neoplasms;porcine species;white matter	N.

We construct finite volume states with boundary conditions, and define QMC as a weak limit of those states which depend on the boundary conditions. We prove that the limit state is a unique QMC associated with such a model, this means the QMC does not depend on the boundary conditions.

bf5aeed98af01a49c8e906adbc64e3129e9281c7	workshop summary: numerical mathematics in machine learning	machine learning	Very stable, polymer-based electrochemical devices, formed by polymerization of thiophene or a derivative such as 3-methylthiophene which is durable in an aqueous electrolyte over a wide pH range, which respond rapidly to chemical or electrical signals, are disclosed. In one embodiment, the device functions as an extremely sensitive sensor which measures changes in chemical concentration or pH. For example, a poly-3-methylthiophene-based device is sensitive to as little as 8x10-16 moles of an oxidant which reversibly interacts with the polymer, including gas phase oxidants such as I2. In a variation of the polymer-based device, a catalyst such as a noble metal or an enzyme, is dispersed on or within the conducting polymer matrix so that the device is responsive to chemicals such as H2 and O2 which the polymer would otherwise respond very slowly to. In a second embodiment, a polymer-based electrochromic device consists of polymer-coated microelectrodes which are individually addressed. Very high resolution is achieved by separating the microelectrodes by distances on the order of 10,000 Angstroms. In still another embodiment, the polymer-based device functions as a capacitor with an energy density as high as 200-300 J/cm3 which can operate at frequencies as high as 100 Hz. Large polymer-based capacitors are useful for storage of solar energy or as automobile batteries. Microcapacitors may be incorporated into conventional integrated circuit designs.	machine learning;numerical analysis	Matthias W. Seeger;Suvrit Sra;John P.

The ring-down time corresponds to the time taken by the light inside an optical cavity to decay to 1/e of its initial intensity. The online estimation of ring-down time (or decay time) for a cavity is a direct indication of the absorbing species contained in it and can be used to detect improvised explosive devices and concealed explosives. Two cases are considered for EKF design depending on whether the resonant frequency of the optical cavity is perfectly locked to the input laser frequency, or not. In the case of a perfect lock, a three-state EKF is designed to estimate the magnitude and phase quadrature components of the cavity and the ring-down time. In the other case where there is not a perfect lock between the two frequencies, leading to non-zero detuning, a four-state EKF is designed to estimate the detuning parameter in addition to the magnitude and phase quadrature components of the cavity and the ring-down time. The detuning parameter gives an indication of the deviation of laser frequency from the resonant frequency of the cavity, which can then be used by a controller to maintain detuning at zero.	cavity quantum electrodynamics;converge;downtime;extended kalman filter;fall time;in-phase and quadrature components;resonance;ringdown;three-state logic	Abhijit G.

With the combination of a well-designed photonic crystal waveguide (PhCW) filter and an elaborate single-slot PCNC, a specific high-order resonant mode was filtered for sensing. A 1 × 3 beam splitter carefully established was implemented to split channels and integrate three sensors to realize microarrays. By applying the three-dimensional finite-difference-time-domain (3D-FDTD) method, the sensitivities calculated were S₁ = 492 nm/RIU, S₂ = 244 nm/RIU, and S₃ = 552 nm/RIU, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multiplexing design in which each sensor cite features such a high sensitivity simultaneously.	beam splitter device component;cone-beam computed tomography;contribution;crystal oscillator;demultiplexer (media file);finite-difference time-domain method;gentian violet;lumpers and splitters;microarray;multiplexing;resonance;silicon;simulation;sodium monofluorophosphate 0.0076 mg/mg toothpaste;waveguide device component;sensor (device)	Jian Zhou;Lijun Huang;Zhongyuan Fu;Fujun Sun;Huiping Tian	2016		10.3390/s16071050	photonic crystal;electronic engineering;filter;analytical chemistry;optics;resonator;physics;multiplexing;quantum mechanics	Robotics	93.5477997551967	-18.400962578282677	48515

Most of the previous studies and applications focused on gold nanorods with relatively small aspect ratios, where the plasmon wavelengths are smaller than 900 nm. Gold nanorods with large aspect ratios are predicted to exhibit high refractive-index sensitivity (Langmir 2008, 24, 5233⁻5237), which therefore should be promising for the development of high-performance plasmonic chemical- and bio-sensors. In this study, we developed gold nanorods with aspect ratios over 7.9, which exhibit plasmon resonances around 1064 nm. The refractive index (RI) sensitivity of these nanorods have been evaluated by varying their dielectric environment, whereby a sensitivity as high as 473 nm/RIU (refractive index unit) can be obtained. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the large-aspect-ratio nanorods as efficient substrate for surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), where an enhancement factor (EF) as high as 9.47 × 10⁸ was measured using 4-methylbenzenethiol (4-MBT) as probe molecule. Finally, a type of flexible SERS substrate is developed by conjugating the gold nanorods with the polystyrene (PS) polymer. The results obtained in our study can benefit the development of plasmonic sensing techniques utilized in the near-infrared spectral region.	4-methylbenzenethiol;aspect ratio;atomic-force microscopy;british informatics olympiad;conflict (psychology);entity framework;excitation;experiment;glycerin;nanorods;natural science disciplines;near edge x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy;plasmon;polymer;polystyrenes;rs-232;raman scattering;refractive index;resonance;schematic;small;universities;sensor (device);wavelength	Chao Zhuang;Yifan Xu;Ningsheng Xu;Jinxiu Wen;Huanjun Chen;Shaozhi Deng	2018		10.3390/s18103458	plasmon;engineering;analytical chemistry;nanorod	HCI	93.58704888765078	-16.388173022943405	48543

An important aspect of the corresponding computational problem is the mathematical handling of boundary conditions. This paper aims at providing an explicit and thorough numerical formulation of the adiabatic Neumann boundary conditions imposed by the skull on the diffusive growth of gliomas and in particular on glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Additionally, a detailed exposition of the numerical solution process for a homogeneous approximation of glioma invasion using the Crank–Nicolson technique in conjunction with the Conjugate Gradient system solver is provided. The entire mathematical and numerical treatment is also in principle applicable to mathematically similar physical, chemical and biological phenomena. A comparison of the numerical solution for the special case of pure diffusion in the absence of boundary conditions or equivalently in the presence of adiabatic boundaries placed in infinity with its analytical counterpart is presented. Numerical simulations for various adiabatic boundary geometries and non zero net tumor growth rate support the validity of the corresponding mathematical treatment. Through numerical experimentation on a set of real brain imaging data, a simulated tumor has shown to satisfy the expected macroscopic behavior of glioblastoma multiforme including the adiabatic behavior of the skull. The paper concludes with a number of remarks pertaining to both the biological problem addressed and the more generic diffusion–reaction context. 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The overall goal is to introduce and experimentally test the optical tomographic imaging algorithm based on the radiative transfer equation considering the refractive index. Considering that the high scattering medium with void-like regions has very low absorption and scattering coefficients, we use the radiative transfer equation to describe the optical parameters of the medium. In the process of photo propagation, not only the absorption and scattering coefficients have impact on the light radiance, but also the refractive index affect the light radiance. Therefore, we focus on the impact of the refractive index in this present study. We divide the refractive index into two cases: the uniform refractive index and the gradient refractive index. The paper is the first part of the present study, namely the forward model. We calculate the derivative of the fluency with the optical parameters by upwind-difference method, and a simpler mathematical framework is obtained in our study. In order to verify the accuracy of the forward model, we select the human brain phantom image with a void-like region and tumor as the experimental data. We found that the experimental measurements are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions of the measurements.

Therefore, investigation of the deterioration mechanisms within capacitors is important to reduce their production costs at maintained reliability. These mechanisms were observed in two capacitors batches of classes Y2 (27 nF) and X2 (470 nF). An acoustic emission signal was observed when the capacitors were polarized by excessive voltage. This signal is induced by partial discharges that can lead to capacitor destruction. Next, the capacitors were aged at elevated temperature and also in presence of excessive polarization. We conclude that the acoustic emission signal can predict deterioration of dielectric insulation resistance in capacitors of class Y2. The observed destruction of capacitor of class X2 is caused mainly by detachment of the sprayed metalized contacts that is induced by overheating during partial discharges sparking. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The calculations for the D+H(2) and H+D(2) systems is based on the double many body expansion potential energy surface. The potential energy surface constructed by Kamisaka et al. is employed in the calculation of D(+)+H(2) and H(+)+D(2) reactions. The cross sections and the reaction probabilities for the total angular momentum J = 0 are calculated for all of these systems. The calculated results from the CSDM method are in good agreement with exact quantum mechanical calculations and experimental measurements."""

1546a1c378028034290cebfff053ecee6137dba8	void formation over limiting current density and impurity analysis of tsv fabricated by constant-current pulse-reverse modulation		Microstructure and impurity incorporation are important in through-silicon via (TSV) fabrication due to their relationships to reliability and integrity of the fabricated Microsystems. In this paper, the analysis of microstructure and impurity incorporation of through-silicon vias of different diameters ranging from 60 to 150 lm fabricated using different pulse-reverse current modulations are reported. It was observed that at the low current density of 20 mA/cm, all the through-holes with different diameters are filled with copper without voids and pores. But at the higher current density of 30 mA/cm, the pillars with diameters of 100 lm or larger tend to have void at the middle portion. Preferential deposition at the perimeter of TSV during plating causes the variation of grain sizes in TSV and accelerated deposition. Smaller grain sizes are observed when the void at the core of the TSV begins to form. Impurity analysis using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS) shows the significant difference in impurity level in smaller TSV. Previously observed nanotwins in TSV is partly due to high impurity incorporation rate in the high-aspect ratio trenches. TSVs with larger diameter show no such tendencies which confirm the constant hardness along the length of TSV in previous studies [1]. The localized impurity spots are found in SIMS analysis, which are due to larger grain sizes and segregation of impurity species to the grain boundaries area. 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	constant current;crystal structure;dopant;elasticity (data store);energy minimization;gnu nano;microelectromechanical systems;modulation;modulus robot;perimeter;physical vapor deposition;plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition;plating;printed circuit board;secondary ion mass spectrometry;simulated annealing;the void (virtual reality);through-silicon via;via (electronics)	Nay Lin;Jianmin Miao;Pradeep Dixit	2013	Microelectronics Reliability	10.1016/j.microrel.2013.04.003	nanotechnology	Arch	93.01319195054998	-14.08363354461222	48918

Natural convection heat exchange coefficients in LN are very high. Moreover, the resistivity of copper decreases remarkably at cryogenic temperature, subsequently reducing Joule loss in copper windings. Hence, cryogenic copper-wound electrical machines use less copper to carry the same current compared to airor water-cooled machines, thereby improving the powerto-weight ratio. An experimental study is made of some practical issues related to the design of an LN-cooled machine using as an example the construction of a 220-N permanent magnet tubular linear actuator with a soft magnetic composite stator core.	coefficient;computer cooling;experiment;fault tolerance;ibm notes;joule;nitrogen-vacancy center;prototype;water cooling	Fabrizio Marignetti	2008	2008 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting	10.1109/08IAS.2008.47	materials science;ceramic materials;nuclear magnetic resonance	DB	88.3269208419374	-14.715886394806457	48967

In this paper, a novel technique is introduced to realize that. The coil is made by inserting the thin magnetic core into the center hole of the flat winding wire, and contacting them closely. With this unique structure, the magnetic axis of each coil inclines to the horizontal plane and the inclined angle is adjusted to 35.3°. The antenna structured by placing the coils in rotational symmetry with angles of 120° in the same plane has three orthogonal magnetic axes.	optic axis of a crystal;smart key;thickness (graph theory)	Kachiyasu Sato;Kazuhisa Sano	2014	2014 IEEE 3rd Global Conference on Consumer Electronics (GCCE)	10.1109/GCCE.2014.7031115	electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;electromagnetic coil;nuclear magnetic resonance	Robotics	83.99814640341572	-19.674374387931756	48997

Aflatoxin B1-bovine serum albumin conjugates (AFB-BSA) modified MBs were employed as capture probe, which could specifically bind with GNP-labeled anti-AFB antibodies through immunoreaction, while such specific binding was competitively inhibited by the addition of AFB. After magnetic separation, the supernatant solution containing unbound GNPs was directly tested by UV-Vis spectroscopy. The absorption intensity was directly proportional to the AFB concentration. The influence of GNP size, incubation time and pH was investigated in detail. After optimization, the developed method could detect AFB in a linear range from 20 to 800 ng/L, with the limit of detection at 12 ng/L. The recoveries for spiked maize samples ranged from 92.8% to 122.0%. The proposed immunoassay provides a promising approach for simple, rapid, specific and cost-effective detection of toxins in the field of food safety.	acid-fast bacillus;aflatoxin b1;aflatoxins;bead dosage form;gold sodium thiosulfate;gold-aluminium intermetallic;gross national product;immunoenzyme procedure;immunostimulating conjugate (antigen);mathematical optimization;metal nanoparticles;mycotoxins;nanorods;recovery - action;serum albumin;silver;supernatant;toxin;tracer;analyte;magnetic beads;negative regulation of aflatoxin biosynthetic process	Xu Wang;Reinhard Niessner;Dietmar Knopp	2014		10.3390/s141121535	gold;chromatography;chemistry;colorimetry;aflatoxin;analytical chemistry;nanotechnology;food contaminant;colloidal gold;food microbiology	Robotics	96.11105001327437	-17.8023055076741	49080

As a proof-of-principle, we used BT spores displaying enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) on the spore surface to spatially direct the EGFP-presenting spores within microcapsules. BT spore-encapsulated microdroplets of uniform size and shape are prepared through a flow-focusing method in a microfluidic device and converted into microcapsules through hydrogel polymerization. The size of microdroplets can be controlled by changing both the dispersion and continuous flow rate. Poly(N-isoproplyacrylamide) (PNIPAM), known as a hydrogel material, was employed as a biocompatible material for the encapsulation of BT spores and long-term storage and outstanding stability. Due to these unique properties of PNIPAM, the nutrients from Luria-Bertani complex medium diffused into the microcapsules and the microencapsulated spores germinated into vegetative cells under adequate environmental conditions. These results suggest that there is no limitation of transferring low-molecular-weight-substrates through the PNIPAM structures, and the viability of microencapsulated spores was confirmed by the culture of vegetative cells after the germinations. This microfluidic-based microencapsulation methodology provides a unique way of synthesizing bioactive microcapsules in a one-step process. This microfluidic-based strategy would be potentially suitable to produce microcapsules of various microbial spores for on-site biosensor analysis.	bacillus thuringiensis;biosensors;british informatics olympiad;diffusion;encapsulation (networking);germination;green fluorescent proteins;high-throughput computing;hydrogel;intrauterine devices;metabolic biotransformation;microcapsules drug delivery system;microchip analytical devices;microfluidics;nutrients;persistent vegetative state;propionibacterium acnes;spore;spore identification:prid:pt:xxx:nom:malachite green stain;throughput;enhanced green fluorescent protein;poly-n-isopropylacrylamide	Byeong-Il Kim;Soon Woo Jeong;Kyoung G.

8741fc24acbbb4736ad082b0ab4a4a882ae1a4f7	comparison of the molecular interactions of 7′-carboxyalkyl apigenin derivatives with s. cerevisiae α-glucosidase	α glucosidase;quantum chemical calculations;charge density;dipole moment;molecular docking	As one of the most investigated flavonoids, apigenin, is considered to be a strong α-glucosidase inhibitor. However, the clinical utility of apigenin is limited due to its low solubility. It was reported that the solubility and biological activity can be improved by introducing sole carboxyalkyl group into apigenin, especially the 7'-substitution. With the increase of length of the alkyl chain in carboxyalkyl group, B ring of the apigenin derivative is embedded much more deeply into the binding cavity while the carboxyalkyl stretches to the neighboring cavity. All of the terminal carboxyl groups form hydrogen bonding interactions easily with the surrounding polar amino acids, such as His239, Ser244, Arg312 and Asp349. Thus, the electron density values of the carbonyl in the carboxyl group become higher than the solution status due to the strong molecular interactions. In fact, electron densities of most of the chemical bonds are decreased after molecular docking procedure. On compared with the solution phase, however, dipole moments of most of these molecules are increased, and their vectors are reoriented distinctly in the active sites. It is noticed that all of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) and Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) are distributed throughout the whole parent apigenin ring in solution phase, whereas the disappeared situation happened on the B rings of some molecules (II-IV) in the active site, leading to higher energy gaps.

When an unusual substance is contained in the sludge, however, the attenuation of ultrasonic waves could be increased or not be transmitted to the receiver. In this case, the value measured by a concentration meter is higher than the actual density value or vibration. As well, it is difficult to automate the residuals treatment process according to the various problems such as sludge attachment or sensor failure. An ultrasonic multi-beam concentration sensor was considered to solve these problems, but an abnormal concentration value of a specific ultrasonic beam degrades the accuracy of the entire measurement in case of using a conventional arithmetic mean for all measurement values, so this paper proposes a method to improve the accuracy of the sludge concentration determination by choosing reliable sensor values and applying a neuro-fuzzy learning algorithm. The newly developed meter is proven to render useful results from a variety of experiments on a real water treatment plant.	adjudication;attachments;choose (action);clotting time:time:pt:bld:qn:lee white;comment (computer programming);conflict (psychology);densitometer device component;desulfuromonas michiganensis;experiment;feature selection;heart failure;holmium:yag laser device;largest;machilus wangchiana;machine learning;medial tibial stress syndrome;neuro-fuzzy;numerous;polymer;polymers;preprocessor;programming languages;purification of quantum state;selection algorithm;sensor;ultrasonic waves;ultrasonics (sound);water purification;algorithm;sensor (device);transmission process	Ho-Hyun Lee;Sang-Bok Jang;Gang-Wook Shin;Sung-Taek Hong;Dae Jong Lee;Myung-Geun Chun	2015		10.3390/s151026961	text mining;medical research;telecommunications;computer science;bioinformatics;engineering;electrical engineering;data mining;nanotechnology;biological engineering	Robotics	95.26778545296517	-20.767566068159457	49357

The ultimate goal of the project is to design the sensor with minimum size and with maximum sensitivity providing minimum response time. The sensor will allow determination of humidity variation in different generations of the human lung during a breath. The design process involves an appropriate simulation of the sensor to investigate the influence of several parameters on its sensitivity, and to develop a microheater that would be used to thermally reset the sensor. This sensor consists of interdigitated electrodes formed as a capacitor using aluminum as conductor and polyimide as dielectric built on a silicon substrate. For the thermal resetting, a polysilicon microheater will be built just underneath the sensor. The system should have quick absorption of moisture and ideally have a response time of less than 1 s. This specific requirement would allow for several measurements during one breath period. In order to meet these constraints a capacitive sensor was designed with a dielectric sensitive to humidity. Other parameters such as shapes of air contact surfaces, domain dimensions, properties of materials, etc. are analyzed and results are shown as well.	sensor;thermal grease	A. H. M.

This is one of the central issues of the in silico biomolecular computing. In this paper, we addressed this issue by studying model granularity dependence of the native structure dynamics of protein molecules. We conducted molecular dynamics simulations employing three different protein models: the model with full atomic details and two coarse-grained models in which only Cα atoms interacting with each other through simple potentials are considered. In addition to the observed agreement among the three models in terms of isotropic thermal fluctuation, principal component analysis showed that the coarse-grained models can also reproduce the anisotropy (or directionality) of the fluctuation, particularly of collective modes having relevance to molecular function. This indicates that the dependence of the essential dynamics of a protein molecule on the model granularity is weak, although it was also shown that incorporation of the Lennard–Jones-type potential into the harmonic-potential-based coarse-grained model improves the reproducibility to some degree, and that a plastic nature of structural dynamics observed in the full atomic model transforms into an elastic one in the coarse-grained models. The coarse-grained model can be applied to a molecular motor system, which may lead to a new view of biomolecular computing in the context of biological physics.	computer simulation;interaction;jones calculus;lennard-jones potential;molecular dynamics;principal component analysis;quantum fluctuation;quantum harmonic oscillator;relevance;structural dynamics	Mitsunori Takano;Junichi Higo;Hironori K.

In this paper, a new capacitive method is presented to detect the liquid level. Existing methods are generally approximations based on the large difference between the dielectric constants of the liquids and the air. The method proposed here eliminates the effect of air and gives the accurate reading of the liquid level in the tank. The main advantage of the method is that it can directly be applied to any kind of nonconductive liquid without calibration. The method is based on the measurements of capacitances of three parallel plate capacitive structures, which are designated as level, reference, and air sensors. It is mathematically proven that the method completely eliminates different factors, which affect the readings, such as air and temperature. The capacitance measurements are performed using a capacitance-to-digital converter integrated circuit, which can measure very small capacitances up to plusmn4 fF error. The result of a computer simulation, which demonstrates the performance and limitations of the proposed structure, is also provided.	analog-to-digital converter;approximation;computer simulation;integrated circuit;sensor	Hüseyin Canbolat	2009	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2009.2019715	computer simulation;electronic engineering;computer science;electrical engineering;capacitive sensing;physics	Visualization	90.22468473517723	-19.36340952505435	49825

Room-temperature current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of n-Al0.15Ga0.85 N/p-6H–SiC emitter–base heterojunction exhibited good rectifying behavior with a forward current 5 10 2 A and reverse current 3 10 9 A at 10 V and 10 V, respectively. Analysis of the temperature dependent I–V characteristics of this heterojunction revealed a barrier height of 1.1 eV. The fabricated n-Al0.15Ga0.85 N/p-SiC/n-SiC bipolar transistor did not exhibit common-emitter operation, however, common-base operation was observed with current gain b = IC/IB ranging in 75–100. 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. It is well-known that a heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) has many advantages over the conventional homojunction bipolar junction transistor (BJT) since the wider bandgap emitter material limits reverse injection from the base to emitter. This allows one to increase the base doping and/or to reduce the base thickness, leading to the decreased base transit time which in turn results in the increased speed, because the injection efficiency of the heterojunction is nearly independent of the doping level on both sides. The emitter and base can be, therefore, lightly and heavily doped, respectively, without deterioration of the current gain. For hightemperature and high-power applications wide-bandgap HBTs are used. Because of a number properties such as large conduction-band offset, large energy-gap differences, good thermal conductivity, and relatively good lattice matching III-nitrides and 4H, 6H–SiC materials are well-suited for the realization of high-power, high temperature HBTs. There were several reports on HBTs based on GaN/SiC heterojunctions [1–3]. Also it was reported that the GaN/SiC system has a type II band alignment, while the AlGaN/ SiC is a type I system [4]. In the latter case the conduction and valence band offset value depends on the Al composition. With increase of Al in AlGaN alloy the lattice mismatch (Da/a) between AlGaN and 6H–SiC is decreases from 3.4% for GaN to 1% for AlN [5]. From this point alone AlxGa1–xN seems to be a better choice compared to GaN for realizing high performance HBT. Despite this point no reports were done yet on fabrication of AlGaN/SiC HBT. In this report we made the first attempts to study the performance of such type HBT with AlGaN/6H–SiC emitter–base heterojunction. A 0.3 lm thick n-type Al0.15Ga0.85 N layer which served as the wide bandgap emitter was grown on 6H type p-SiC/n-SiC by metll rights reserved. -Irvine, Radiological Sciences, alorganic chemical-vapor deposition (MOCVD). The 0.1 lm thick pSiC layer of the stack, which served as the base, was grown homoepitaxially on 0.3 lm thickness n-SiC layer by chemical-vapor deposition. The n-SiC layer was functioning as the collector. The n-SiC layer in turn was grown on a highly conductive n-type 6H– SiC substrate with carrier concentration 3 10 cm . The carrier concentrations of p-type and n-type SiC layers were 3 10 cm 3 and 1 10 cm , respectively. An Al0.15Ga0.85 N layer was grown on p-SiC layer by MOCVD with trimethylgallium (TMGa), trimethylaluminum (TMAl) and ammonia as the Ga, Al and N sources, respectively. The growth was carried out at a relatively low chamber pressure of 30 torr at 1060 C. The flow rate for Ga, Al, NH3 was kept at 55 lmol/min, 8 lmol/min, 1000 sccm, respectively. According to the X-ray diffraction (XRD) results, which are shown in Fig. 1, from one test growth on a GaN template using the same growth condition, the composition of Al for the Al0.15Ga0.85 N layer was around 15%. Reasonably high crystal quality of the grown Al0.15Ga0.85 N layers can be seen from the FWHM values of X-ray rocking curves for (0 0 0 2) and (1 0 1 2) peaks, which were 3.7 arcmin and 12 arcmin, respectively. These values are comparable to the best ones reported before [6,7]. A schematic of the fabricated Al0.15Ga0.85 N/SiC HBT is shown in Fig. 2. The HBT mesa structures were fabricated using conventional photolithography on a 10 10 mm size substrate. The HBT mesa structures were defined by reactive ion etching (RIE), in which as an etchant BCl3 was used. The HBT mesa structures were isolated from each other by trenches. Ohmic metallization to n-AlGaN emitter, p-SiC base and n-SiC collector were formed using Ti/Au (300/300 ÅA 0 ), Al/Au (300/300 ÅA 0 ), and Ni/Au (300/300 ÅA 0 ), respectively. These ohmic contacts were patterned by lithographic liftoff of e-beam deposited Al, Au, Ni, and Ti which were subsequently annealed at 900 C for 1 min in nitrogen ambient.

Nevertheless, MEMS resonators performances are still not competitive, especially in terms of frequency stability and device equivalent resistance (and, then, power consumption). We propose a new structure for a MEMS resonator, with a vertical-like transduction mechanism, which exhibits promising features. The vertical resonator can be fabricated with the low-cost, high performance THELMA technology, and it is designed to be efficiently frequency tunable. With respect to the commonly investigated lateral resonators, it is expected to have lower equivalent resistances and improved large-scale repeatability characteristics.

The main features of CalcHEP are the computation of Feynman diagrams, integration over multiparticle phase space and event simulation at parton level. The principle attractive key-points along these lines are that it has: (a) an easy startup and usage even for those who are not familiar with CalcHEP and programming; (b) a friendly and convenient graphical user interface (GUI); (c) the option for the user to easily modify a model or introduce a new model by either using the graphical interface or by using an external packagewith the possibility of cross checking the results in different gauges; (d) a batch interface which allows to perform very complicated and tedious calculations connecting production and decay modes for processes with many particles in the final state. With this features set, CalcHEP can efficiently perform calculations with a high level of automation from a theory in the form of a Lagrangian down to phenomenology in the form of cross sections, parton level event simulation and various kinematical distributions. In this paper we report on the new features of CalcHEP 3.4 which improves the power of our package to be an effective tool for the study of modern collider phenomenology.	computation;cross section (geometry);diagram;emoticon;graphical user interface;high-level programming language;simulation	Alexander Belyaev;Neil D.

The results are in general much less sensitive to the size of the basis set as in conventional ab initio molecular orbital (MO) theory, while the choice of the functional is of much more significance. For one basis set (6-311G*), the performance of the DFT-based calculations has been compared and found to be superior to Hartree-Fock (HF) Mdler Plesset second order perturbation theory (MP2), or configuration interaction with single and double excitations (CISD) calculations.

Such equations arise in radiative transport for the Stokes parameters that model the propagation of light through turbulent atmospheres. They also arise in radiative transport for seismic wave propagation in the earth's crust. The probabilistic representation involves an augmented scalar transport equation in which the polarization parameters become independent variables. Our main result is that the linear moments of the augmented transport equation with respect to the polarization variables are the solution of the matrix-valued transport equation. The augmented scalar transport equation is well suited to analyzing the hydrodynamic regime of small mean free paths. It is also well suited to getting approximate solutions by Monte Carlo simulation.	approximation algorithm;monte carlo method;polarization (waves);simulation;software propagation;stokes parameters;the matrix;turbulence	George Papanicolaou;Guillaume Bal;Leonid Ryzhik	2000	SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics	10.1137/S003613999935696X	classical mechanics;statistical physics;waves;transport;mathematical optimization;polarization;convection–diffusion equation;diffusion;thermodynamics;photon transport in biological tissue;physics	ML	92.37519258034108	2.5943405466136684	50203

In this paper, a method of estimating the deposition-rate ratio between zones using small signal perturbation sequences is presented that exploits the exponential dependence of deposition rate on the temperature of the molten metal. A quality metric for the ratio estimate is presented, which can be easily calculated. Then, in order to determine the best perturbation sequence that meets all manufacturing constraints, a constrained optimization problem is described that is shown to be convex. An interesting feature of the solution is the importance of correlations between purturbation inputs.

fdcd25f2a8e6e79ce7acd3ddba131f629ac167f2	accurate solution of multi-region continuum biomolecule electrostatic problems using the linearized poisson-boltzmann equation with curved boundary elements	static electricity;ions;fast solver;solvents;models molecular;proteins;protein conformation;curved boundary;thermodynamics;fftsvd;algorithms;computer simulation;solvation;poisson boltzmann equation	We present a boundary-element method (BEM) implementation for accurately solving problems in biomolecular electrostatics using the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation. Motivating this implementation is the desire to create a solver capable of precisely describing the geometries and topologies prevalent in continuum models of biological molecules. This implementation is enabled by the synthesis of four technologies developed or implemented specifically for this work. First, molecular and accessible surfaces used to describe dielectric and ion-exclusion boundaries were discretized with curved boundary elements that faithfully reproduce molecular geometries. Second, we avoided explicitly forming the dense BEM matrices and instead solved the linear systems with a preconditioned iterative method (GMRES), using a matrix compression algorithm (FFTSVD) to accelerate matrix-vector multiplication. Third, robust numerical integration methods were employed to accurately evaluate singular and near-singular integrals over the curved boundary elements. Fourth, we present a general boundary-integral approach capable of modeling an arbitrary number of embedded homogeneous dielectric regions with differing dielectric constants, possible salt treatment, and point charges. A comparison of the presented BEM implementation and standard finite-difference techniques demonstrates that for certain classes of electrostatic calculations, such as determining absolute electrostatic solvation and rigid-binding free energies, the improved convergence properties of the BEM approach can have a significant impact on computed energetics. We also demonstrate that the improved accuracy offered by the curved-element BEM is important when more sophisticated techniques, such as nonrigid-binding models, are used to compute the relative electrostatic effects of molecular modifications. In addition, we show that electrostatic calculations requiring multiple solves using the same molecular geometry, such as charge optimization or component analysis, can be computed to high accuracy using the presented BEM approach, in compute times comparable to traditional finite-difference methods.

ca1f74c08783426ac2a636abe653689425bcb5f7	a fish-like magnetically propelled microswimmer fabricated by 3d laser lithography		This paper presents the development of a fish-like magnetically propelled microswimmer fabricated by 3D laser lithography. The microswimmer consists of a head and a caudal fin, just like a natural fish. There is a joint between the head and the fin so that the caudal fin can oscillate around the head to generate thrust, and the oscillation of the fin hardly transfers to the head, which benefits the stable motion of the microswimmer. The caudal fin of the microswimmer is deposited with a layer of 50 nm nickel (Ni) for magnetic actuation. Through applying an oscillating uniform magnetic field, the microswimmer can move along with the direction guided by the external magnetic field. A magnetic control system with permanent magnets is designed to provide such an oscillating uniform magnetic field, where the oscillating frequency and amplitude are controllable. A micro probe operation platform is used to detach the fabricated microswimmers from glass substrate in manufacturing. The proposed magnetically propelled microswimmer can be potentially used as powerful detoxification and biosensing tools for medical diagnosis and treatment in precision medicine.	control system;precision medicine;thrust	Pan Liao;Junyang Li;Shiwu Zhang;Dong Sun	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	10.1109/ICRA.2018.8460522	thrust;fin;propulsion;maskless lithography;magnetic field;control engineering;magnet;engineering;magnetic domain;magnetic flux;optics	Robotics	90.65086678688509	-17.23430459574711	50732

The measurement of the average effect of the capacitive probe and the influence of capacitive probe tilting were studied with respect to an eccentric spherical surface. Based on the tested characteristic curve of the average effect of the sphere and probe, it was found that nonlinear and linear compensation resulted in high measurement accuracy.

961ac073ed0f4c474872184acdb879b80abf1f9e	ab initio potential energy surface and predicted microwave spectra for arocs dimer and structures of arnocs (n = 2-14) clusters	interaction energy;arnocs cluster;ah initio;ab initio;microwave spectra;potential energy surface;minimum energy structure;ar n ocs cluster	An ab initio potential energy surface for the Ar--OCS dimer was calculated using the coupled-cluster singles and doubles with noniterative inclusion of connected triples [CCSD(T)] with a large basis set containing bond functions. The interaction energies were obtained by the supermolecular approach with the full counterpoise correction for the basis set superposition error. The CCSD(T) potential was found to have two minima corresponding to the T-shaped and the collinear Ar--SCO structures. The two-dimensional discrete variable representation method was employed to calculate the rovibrational energy levels for five isotopomers Ar--OCS, Ar--OC34S, Ar--O13CS, Ar--18OCS, and Ar--17OCS. The calculated pure rotational transition frequencies for the vibrational ground state of the five isotopomers are in good agreement with the observed values. The corresponding microwave spectra show that the b-type transitions (Delta Ka = +/-1) are significantly stronger than the a-type transitions (Delta Ka = 0). Minimum-energy structures of the Ar2--OCS trimer were been determined with MP2 optimization, whereas the minimum-energy structures of the Arn--OCS clusters with n = 3-14 were obtained with the pairwise additive potentials. It was found that there are two minima corresponding to one distorted tetrahedral structure and one planar structure for the ternary complex. The 14 nearest neighbor Ar atoms form the first solvation shell around the OCS molecule.	aortic valve insufficiency;basis set (chemistry);coupled cluster;delta aminolevulinate:scnc:pt:urine:qn;dirac delta function;domino tiling;efimov state;energy level;energy, physics;excited state;ground state;journal of computational chemistry;ka band;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;microwave;møller–plesset perturbation theory;original chip set;potential energy surface;single linkage cluster analysis;singular;utility functions on indivisible goods	Hua Zhu;Yong Guo;Ying Xue;Daiqian Xie	2006	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.20421	atomic physics;chemistry;computational chemistry;interaction energy;physics;potential energy surface;quantum mechanics	Comp.	97.29664964532633	-5.165562790608597	50763
f59a6a6ce6a5ffb4ae9e823aa627ad123a4b8c21	a practical method for finding an efficient static learning rate for ann		An optical system is described for use in processing information on a surface of an erasable record disc. The system decreases erasure time by forming an elongated spot from the generally circular cross section of a collimated laser beam so as to provide increased illumination time to an area recorded on the disc. The system includes a source of collimated light having a generally circular cross section, a cylindrical lens for focusing one aspect of the collimated light at a finite distance f, and a beam expander having the principal plane of its input lens at the distance f from the cylindrical lens, where the light forms a beam waist. An objective lens focuses the expanded elongated beam to a diffraction spot on the surface of the record disc. A linear actuator, such as a voice coil, responds to a control signal to position the cylindrical lens in the path of the collimated light beam for the erasing process, or out of the light path for the recording process.

In this study, three conflicting performance characteristics related to surface integrity such as surface roughness, white layer thickness and surface crack density are considered in electrical discharge machining of RENE80 nickel super alloy. The process parameters considered are peak current, pulse on time and pulse off time. The experiments are conducted based on Taguchi method and these experimental results are used in grey relational analysis and weights of the corresponding performance characteristics are determined by principal component analysis. The weighted grey relational grade is used as a performance index to determine optimum process parameters and results of the confirmation experiments indicate that the combined approach is effective in determining optimum process parameters.

80b074d94622555860784b46e633bb39b04bbde6	ageing mechanisms in deep trench termination (dt2) diode		Thermal cycling induces delamination and causes cyclic strains in a similar way to natural usage and weakens the normal functioning by thermal fatigue. Therefore, such approach can be conveniently used in accelerated testing of components to assess their reliability. The purpose of this work is to evaluate the reliability of DT 2  diode, by accelerated ageing process. Two major modes of failure were observed: the first one is the delamination of the chip and the second one concerns the breakdown voltage variation. Optical observations as well as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis have shown a delamination around the trench termination. Finite element simulations are carried out to explain the experimental results and justify the breakdown voltage variation.	c++builder;diode;electron;thermal grease;traffic collision avoidance system	F.

These motors have relatively small geometric dimensions and it is important to evaluate the negative effects of lamination punching. Two twin 550 W motor prototypes have been produced, one with annealed magnetic cores. By means of an experimental-based comparison, the usefulness of the annealing thermal process on the final motor performance is discussed. Finally, to further prove the possibility to correctly account for the punching process in numerical models, the obtained measurement results have been compared with finite element method simulations, getting a good agreement.	computer simulation;finite element method;prototype;simulated annealing;software prototyping;udp hole punching	Iustin Radu Bojoi;Andrea Cavagnino;Zbigniew Gmyrek;Marcin Lefik	2016	IECON 2016 - 42nd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2016.7793739	control engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;engineering drawing;reluctance motor	HPC	85.11073534314647	-13.59109762798235	51050

Alternative fuels such as CNG, HCNG, LPG, LNG, Bio-Diesel, Biogas, Hydrogen, Ethanol, Methanol, Di-Methyl Ether, Producer gas, P-series have been tried worldwide. Hydrogen as a future fuel for IC engines is also being considered. But several obstacles have to overcome before commercialization of Hydrogen as an IC engine fuel for automotive sector. Hydrogen and CNG blends (HCNG) may be considered as an automotive fuel without any major modification in the existing CNG engine and infrastructure. A strategy has been worked out for converting the developed CNG engine to run on HCNG. The testing is carried out for the neat CNG and 5% blends of Hydrogen by volume with CNG. It is observed in the experimental work that the HCNG engines are more superior to CNG carbureted engines from fuel economy, power output and emission compliance point of view. The power improvement of 11% and fuel consumption reduction of 8% is observed in HCNG engine than the CNG engine. The addition of hydrogen into natural gas increases the burning velocity of mixture, shortening the combustion duration, increasing the cylinder gas temperature, and this increases the effective thermal efficiency compared to that of natural gas engine under the same lean mixture condition. The HCNG engine increases the H/C ratio of the fuel, which drastically reduces the carbon based emissions such as CO, CO2 and HC. To increase the flame speed of HCNG engines, the ignition timing needs to be retarded; this results in reduction of NOx emissions. It is important to note that 5% blends of hydrogen by volume with CNG the phenomenon of hydrogen embrittlement does not occur with respect to engine components, hence no major change is anticipated in fuel system and engine components. Moreover, it improves the engine efficiency, which lowers fuel consumption and hydrocarbon emissions. The research work is undertaken to demonstrate the viability of HCNG as an automotive fuel. This paper explains how CNG is the best route to ensure an early entry of hydrogen fuel into our energy infrastructure. This research work is carried out at Alternative fuel engine development lab, ARAI, Pune, India.	alpha compositing;cylinder-head-sector;diesel;euro-vo;experiment;fossil;flame (malware);hydrogen;mathematical optimization;neat particles;national land and property gazetteer;point of view (computer hardware company);velocity (software development)	K.

It is shown that when the radius of the compact dimension is large supersymmetry is unbroken, and dynamically breaks as the radius decreases. We point out that this resembles the inverse symmetry breaking of continuous symmetries at finite temperature (however, in the case of supersymmetry, the role of the temperature is played by the compact dimension’s radius). Furthermore, we also find a universality in the dependence of the critical length Lc as a function of a coupling g3, after comparing all cases.	symmetry breaking;universality probability	Vasilis Oikonomou	2010	Symmetry	10.3390/sym2010366	supersymmetry breaking;symmetry breaking;effective potential;supersymmetry;quantum electrodynamics;particle physics;physics;quantum mechanics;explicit symmetry breaking	AI	87.40914155928114	1.8660102613987637	51133
5b92115ee57f465d6b6d67b687be02ea2b30df59	reliability of thermally stressed rigid-flex printed circuit boards for high density interconnect applications		The thermal fatigue of vias in rigid–flex printed circuit boards (PCB) is considered in the paper. Dedicated printed circuit boards have been designed with different geometrical configurations (plating thickness, drilled hole diameter and PCB thickness). The PCB is made of hundreds of vias or holes which are wired by copper path to create a daisy chain. The PCB is subject to cyclic thermal loading ( 55 C, +125 C). Electrical connectivity is recorded during tests. Cross sectioning is performed finally to characterize the loss of electrical connectivity. Fracture of plated copper, due to the thermal expansion mismatch between constituents, is shown to be responsible for the failure of the PCB. In addition to environmental tests, finite element model is developed to analyze the deformation of PCBs during thermal cycling. Areas of strain concentration determined by Finite Element Analysis (FEA) are consistent with locations where cracks were observed in experiments. In addition, the numerical estimation of the plastic strain increment per cycle enables the prediction of the fatigue life. The results confirm that for rigid flex boards, the fatigue life of vias increases with higher plating thickness, larger drilled hole size and lower PCB thickness. Numerical results are shown to be in good agreement with experiments. 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The post-process utilizes an etchant to etch the sacrificial layer, and to release the suspended structures. Easy execution and low cost are the advantages of the post-process. The resonator comprises a driving part and a sensing part. The sensing part produces a change in capacitance when applying a driving voltage to the driving part in the resonator.

aadc68fcf948ddb6a0eefed8a2c0c6c89b57bb44	computational modeling of the catalytic mechanism of human placental alkaline phosphatase (plap)		Alkaline phosphatases (APs) catalyze the hydrolysis and transphosphorylation of phosphate monoesters. Quantum mechanical, molecular dynamics, and molecular docking techniques were applied to computationally model the catalytic mechanism of human placental AP (PLAP). Kinetic and thermodynamic evaluations were performed for each reaction step. The functional significances of the more important residues within the active site were analyzed. The role of the metal ion at the metal binding site M3 was also examined. The calculated activation and reaction energy and free energy values obtained suggested the nucleophilic attack of the Ser92 alkoxide on the phosphorus atom of the substrate would be the rate-limiting step of the catalytic hydrolysis of alkyl phosphate monoesters by PLAP. The reactivities of the wild-type M3-Mg enzyme and the M3-Zn protein were compared, and the main difference observed was a change in the coordination number of the M3 metal for the M3-Zn enzyme. This modification in the active site structure lowered the free energy profile for the second chemical step of the catalytic mechanism (hydrolysis of the covalent phosphoserine intermediate). Consequently, a greater stabilization of the phosphoseryl moiety resulted in a small increment in the activation free energy of the phosphoserine hydrolysis reaction. These computational results suggest that the activation of APs by magnesium at the M3 site is caused by the preference of Mg(2+) for octahedral coordination, which structurally stabilizes the active site into a catalytically most active conformation. The present theoretical results are in good agreement with previously reported experimental studies.	alkaline phosphatase;carbamoyl-phosphate synthase i deficiency disease;computation (action);computer simulation;covalent interaction;docking (molecular);energy profile (chemistry);evaluation;hydrolysis;ions;magnesium;molecular dynamics;phosphoric monoester hydrolases;phosphorus;phosphoserine;placenta;protein tyrosine phosphatase;quantum mechanics;rate limiting;tight binding;free energy;inorganic phosphate	Gabriela L.

As compared to the device with HfON/SiO2 dual tunnel layer (DTL), the one with TaON/SiO2 DTL shows larger memory window (3.85 V at ±13 V/1 s), higher program/erase speeds (1.85 V/-2.00 V at +/-12 V/100 μs), better endurance (window narrowing rate of 5.7% after 10 cycles). The main mechanisms involved lie in (1) the higher dielectric constant of TaON which induces high electric field in the SiO2 layer, (2) the smaller conduction/valence-band offsets between TaON and the Si substrate, and (3) better interface quality with SiO2. Furthermore, compared with SiO2 single tunnel layer, better retention characteristics can be achieved for the TaON/SiO2 DTL due to its larger thickness.		Jun Xiang Chen;J. P. Xu;Long Liu;X. D.

In this paper, we propose a novel shield mechanism utilizing the micro-channel, a technique conventionally used for heat removal, to reduce the substrate loss. This technique increases the quality factor and the inductance of the TSV inductor by up to 21x and 17x respectively. It enables us to implement TSV inductors of up to 38x smaller area and 33% higher quality factor, compared with spiral inductors of the same inductance. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first proposal on improving quality factor of TSV inductors. We hope our study shall point out a new and exciting research direction for 3D IC designers.	lossy compression;three-dimensional integrated circuit;through-silicon via	Umamaheswara Rao Tida;Cheng Zhuo;Yiyu Shi	2014	2014 19th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)	10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742994	electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;q factor;inductor;engineering drawing	EDA	90.82197369951152	-14.176024951913904	51490

4d9676c00cfa684247447e4456a5b1d7164ee2db	information anatomy of stochastic equilibria	ephemeral information;langevin equation;bound information;time local predictive information;entropy rate	A stochastic nonlinear dynamical system generates information, as measured by its entropy rate. Some—the ephemeral information—is dissipated and some—the bound information—is actively stored and so affects future behavior. We derive analytic expressions for the ephemeral and bound informations in the limit of small-time discretization for two classical systems that exhibit dynamical equilibria: first-order Langevin equations (i) where the drift is the gradient of a potential function and the diffusion matrix is invertible and (ii) with a linear drift term (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck) but a noninvertible diffusion matrix. In both cases, the bound information is sensitive only to the drift, while the ephemeral information is sensitive only to the diffusion matrix and not to the drift. Notably, this information anatomy changes discontinuously as any of the diffusion coefficients vanishes, indicating that it is very sensitive to the noise structure. We then calculate the information anatomy of the stochastic cusp catastrophe and of particles diffusing in a heat bath in the overdamped limit, both examples of stochastic gradient descent on a potential landscape. Finally, we use our methods to calculate and compare approximations for the so-called time-local predictive information for adaptive agents.	approximation;catastrophe theory;coefficient;discretization;dual total correlation;dynamical system;entropy rate;first-order reduction;mds matrix;nonlinear system;stochastic gradient descent	Sarah Marzen;James P.

The potentials of mean force between the sodium – chloride ion pair are constructed by estimating the mean forces between the ion pair at various interionic separations and then integrating the mean forces. Two compositions of the solvent mixture with DMSO mole fractions of 0.21 and 0.35 are considered. Two model potentials for water and DMSO have been considered. One of the main observations is that the contact ion pair which is dominantly present in both the individual solvents is conspicuously absent in the mixture compositions studied. While solvent separated ion pairs dominate in all the mixture compositions, there is a presence of a second solvent separated ion pair in the water-DMSO mixture of composition with mole fraction of DMSO = 0.21. The potentials of mean force are verified by dynamical trajectories of the ion pair. The dynamics of the solvation shells has also been investigated in detail.		A.

f8c49cf75d8d55106089ba99c758083d7e502354	optimization of flexible printed circuit board electronics in the flow environment using response surface methodology		A flexible printed circuit board (FPCB) is flexible, thin and lightweight; however, FPCBs experience more deflection and stress in the flow environment because of fluid–structure interaction (FSI), which affects their performance. Therefore, the present study focuses to optimize a typical FPCB electronic in order to minimize the deflection and stress induced in the system. In this study, numeric parameters (i.e., flow velocity, component size, component thickness, misalignment angle, as well as the length and width of the FPCB) were optimized using response surface methodology (RSM) with the central composite design technique. The separate effects of the independent variables and their interactions were investigated. The optimized condition was also examined to substantiate the empirical models generated using RSM. At a flow velocity of 5 m/s, the optimum values of the component size, component thickness, misalignment angle, as well as the length and width of the FPCB were determined at 11.69 mm, 12.37 mm, 0.73 , as well as 180 mm and 180 mm, respectively. This optimized condition resulted in a maximum deflection of 0.402 mm and a maximum stress of 0.582 MPa. The findings conveyed can contribute to the development of FPCB industries. 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

To achieve a small size, fast imaging speed, wide scan range, and high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in a water environment, we introduce a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based 2-axis scanner for a flexible and waterproof structure. The design, theoretical background, fabrication process and performance of the scanner are explained in details. The designed and fabricated scanner has dimensions of 15 × 15 × 15 mm along the X, Y and Z axes, respectively. The characteristics of the scanner are tested under DC and AC conditions. By pairing with electromagnetic forces, the maximum scanning angles in air and water are 18° and 13° along the X and Y axes, respectively. The measured resonance frequencies in air and water are 60 and 45 Hz along the X axis and 45 and 30 Hz along the Y axis, respectively. Finally, OR-PAM with high SNRs is demonstrated using the fabricated scanner, and the PA images of micro-patterned samples and microvasculatures of a mouse ear are successfully obtained with high-resolution and wide-field of view. OR-PAM equipped with the 2-axis PDMS based waterproof scanner has lateral and axial resolutions of 3.6 μm and 26 μm, respectively. This compact OR-PAM system could potentially and widely be used in preclinical and clinical applications.	artificial consciousness;axis vertebra;dimensions;dimethylpolysiloxanes;handheld game console;hertz (hz);image resolution;imaging device;lateral thinking;optic axis of a crystal;pdms;photoacoustic spectroscopy;potassium aggravated myotonia;resonance;scanner device component;scanning systems;semiconductor device fabrication;signal-to-noise ratio;video-in video-out	Jin Young Kim;Changho Lee;Kyungjin Park;Geunbae Lim;Chul-hong Kim	2015		10.3390/s150509815	white light scanner;analytical chemistry;nanotechnology;optics	Robotics	93.59457237549734	-21.45240309000422	52138

3f31d9d02c5afde0dadafa25b11fa320d85838e8	least-squares estimation of nanopore channel conductance in voltage-varying experiments		Step-changing and sinusoidal voltage patterns have expanded the capabilities of the nanopore instrument for single molecule manipulation and measurement. A challenge with voltage-varying experiments is that capacitance in the system is excited and masks the contribution of the nanopore channel conductance in the measured current. The conductance is the parameter that can be used to infer the dynamics of the complex (e.g., DNA, or DNA-protein) in the pore. We present a least-squares parameter estimation (LSPE) algorithm for estimating the channel conductance under voltage-varying conditions, including step and sinusoidal voltages, with the objective of inferring the channel conductance parameter as continuously as possible. The algorithm is shown to recover the conductance faster than by waiting for capacitive transients to settle in step-voltage experiments, and provides accurate continuous conductance estimates in sinusoidal voltage experiments, with realistic noise levels superimposed on the measurements.	algorithm;conductance (graph);estimation theory;experiment;least squares	Christopher R.

We have implemented a spin-adapted Coupled Cluster with singles and doubles excitation with local molecular orbital approach. As a first application, we evaluate the static polarizability of conjugated polyene chains with finite field approach. It is found that the local molecular orbital approach can tremendously reduce the computational costs at sufficiently high accuracy. It is also found that the electron correlation can largely reduce the molecular polarizability with respect to the Hartree-Fock mean field results.

We report on the surface insulation resistance decrease prior to the dendritic bridge. The silver ECM mechanism in the initial stage of resistance decrease was analyzed and has been determined to be due to the continuous generation and accumulation of silver ions. Resistance decrease paths may be established prior to the appearance of dendritic migration paths. The investigation shows that the initial stage of ECM is also the rate controlling stage.	dendritic spine;elegant degradation;printed circuit board;sandy bridge;tree accumulation	Shuang Yang;Ji Wu;Aristos Christou	2006	Microelectronics Reliability	10.1016/j.microrel.2006.07.080	sheet resistance;engineering;electrical engineering;nanotechnology;forensic engineering;metallurgy;physics	AI	92.05510816875743	-12.184742355367835	52670

Our aim is to devise a geometry which is suitable for comparing power spectral densities of multivariable time series. More specifically, the value of a power spectral density at a given frequency, which in the matricial case encodes power as well as directionality, is thought of as a proxy for a “matrix-valued mass density.” Optimal transport aims at establishing a natural metric in the space of such matrix-valued densities which takes into account differences between power across frequencies as well as misalignment of the corresponding principle axes. Thus, our transportation cost includes a cost of transference of power between frequencies together with a cost of rotating the principle directions of matrix densities. The two end-point matrix-valued densities can be thought of as marginals of a joint matrix-valued density on a tensor product space. This joint density, very much as in the classical Monge-Kantorovich setting, can be thought to specify the transportation plan. Contrary to the classical setting, the optimal transport plan for matrices is no longer supported on a thin zero-measure set.	advance directive - proxy;arabic numeral 0;mass density;spectral density;time series;transportation theory (mathematics)	Lipeng Ning;Tryphon T.

Because crystal orientation plays a key role in determining material strength, accurate identification of a crystal's orientation is a crucial problem. To achieve a high level of accuracy repeated EBSD sessions are aggregated, but material degradation and misalignment can occur between sessions resulting in spurious crystal orientations. Currently the projected mean is used to estimate the true crystal orientation from repeated EBSD sessions, but it has been shown to perform poorly when extreme observations are present. The projected and geometric medians have been proposed as robust alternatives, but a rigorous treatment of their behavior has not been undertaken. In this manuscript we evaluate the behavior of the projected estimators as well as the geometric median when extreme observations are present. We also quantify the effect of extreme observations on the projected estimators by deriving their influence functions. Then we propose a statistic that can be used to identify extreme observations and propose a novel mean-type estimator that has improved robustness properties over the projected mean estimator. The investigated estimators are illustrated with a EBSD data set.	crystal oscillator;electron tomography;elegant degradation;geometric median;high-level programming language;robustness (computer science)	Bryan Stanfill	2014	17th International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION)		crystallography;materials science;ceramic materials;optics	Visualization	101.46510289994872	-8.333717184303138	52881

We examine sensors made of natural rubber (NR-latex) that include magnetic particles of Ni and Fe₃O₄ using magnetic compound fluid (MCF). The 1-mm thickness of the electrolytically polymerized MCF rubber makes production of comparatively thin rubber sensors feasible. We first investigate the effect of magnetic particles Ni and Fe₃O₄ on the curing of MCF rubber. Next, in order to adjust the electric properties of the MCF rubber, we adopt Al₂O₃ dielectric particles. We investigate the effect of Al₂O₃ particles on changes in electric current, voltage and temperature of electrolytically polymerized MCF rubber liquid, and on the electric properties under the application of normal and shear forces. By adjusting the ratio of Ni, Fe₃O₄, Al₂O₃ and water in MCF rubber with Al₂O₃, it is possible to change the electric properties.	artificial skin;electricity;filler (substance);iron(ii,iii) oxide;latex;meta content framework;noise reduction;particle;rubber;star filler;thickness (graph theory);nickel;sensor (device);voltage	Kunio Shimada;Osamu Mochizuki;Yoshihiro Kubota	2017		10.3390/s17040896	particle;magnetic field;sensor;electrical resistivity and conductivity;physics;quantum mechanics;dielectric	HCI	90.92049277922766	-17.85196926427887	52944

In this study, an efficient QM/MM method is developed by the combination of the DFTB/MM and particle mesh Ewald (PME) methods. Because the Fock matrix, which is required in the DFTB calculation, is analytically obtained by the PME method, the Coulomb energy is accurately and rapidly computed. For assessing the performance of this method, DFTB/MM calculations and molecular dynamics simulation are conducted for a system consisting of two amyloid-β(1-16) peptides and a zinc ion in explicit water under periodic boundary conditions. As compared with that of the conventional Ewald summation method, the computational cost of the Coulomb energy by utilizing the present approach is drastically reduced, i.e., 166.5 times faster. Furthermore, the deviation of the electronic energy is less than 10-6 Eh. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	algorithmic efficiency;ewald summation;fock space;ions;john d. wiley;molecular dynamics;molecular mechanics;particle mesh;periodic boundary conditions;qm/mm;quantum mechanics;simulation;summation (document);tight binding	Hiroaki Nishizawa;Hisashi Okumura	2016	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.24497	classical mechanics;molecular dynamics;chemistry;computational chemistry;mathematics;periodic boundary conditions;biomolecule;p3m;physics;quantum mechanics	HPC	96.06480759242221	-2.521868347845362	53013

The statistical behavior of some isolated phenomena, such as dilute unbounded molecular diffusion, are well understood. However, the coupling of multiple interactions can impede closed-form analysis, such that simulations are required to determine the statistics. This paper compares the statistics of molecular reaction-diffusion simulation models from the perspective of molecular communication systems. Microscopic methods track the location and state of every molecule, whereas mesoscopic methods partition the environment into virtual containers that hold molecules. The properties of each model are described and compared with a hybrid of both models. Simulation results also assess the accuracy of Poisson and Gaussian approximations of the underlying Binomial statistics.	approximation;computer simulation;interaction;mesoscopic physics;software propagation	Adam Noel;Karen C.

The surface potential decay of MIM capacitors during discharge has been monitored using a Single-point Kelvin probe system at various temperatures (300 K–400 K) while the shift of bias at minimum up-state capacitance during discharge has been employed in MEMS capacitive switches in order to determine the discharge current through the bulk of the film at different temperatures. The results indicate that the discharging process through the bulk of silicon nitride films is thermally activated and the corresponding value of the discharging current increases with temperature, due to the increase of the film conductivity. Moreover, the value of minimum up-state capacitance of the switches is found to be significantly affected by temperature, by the mechanical properties of the moving armature as well as by the variance of charge density distribution. Finally, different thermally activated mechanisms have been observed in MIM capacitors and MEMS capacitive switches, due to different charging processes on these devices.	microelectromechanical systems;network switch;plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition	Matroni Koutsoureli;N.

The purpose of this study was to investigate how the addition of soy extract affects porosity and wettability of the CSC. Soy was added to commercially available CSC named Portland cement (Italcementi, Spa Bergamo, Italy) at 10 weight % Pure Portland cement was used as a control material. Particle cement size was determined using scanning electron microscopy (TESCAN Mira3 XMU, USA Inc). Porosity of the cement was measured using micro computed tomography (μCT) (Skyscan 1172, Bruker, Belgium) at 10 μm isotropic resolution. Wettability of the cements was tested using contact angle analyzer and Endomethasone (Saint Maur, Cedex, France). Scanning electron microscopy has shown that Portland cement is composed of spherical and rods like particles ranging in size from 1 μm to 10 μm. The μCT analysis revealed that the addition of soy leads to an increased cement's porosity. Both open and closed porosity values were higher in Portland cement with soy addition than in pure Portland cement. More than 70% of pores were in the range of 20-57 μm in both investigated groups. The addition of soy resulted in lower contact angles of Endomethasone on the cement surface, suggesting that this cement formulation possesses superior wettability. It can be deduced that soy is a promising candidate for Portland cement adhesive properties improvements.	ct scan;electron;microarchitecture;portland pattern repository;sudarsky's gas giant classification;tomography	Djordje Antonijević;Ksenija Zelic;Marija Djuric	2015	2015 IEEE 15th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (BIBE)	10.1109/BIBE.2015.7367632	calcium;irrigation;computed tomography;mineralogy	Visualization	94.31450998991113	-15.277802963404964	53660

Tests were conducted under various conditions. The following environments were considered: three high-temperature conditions, two high temperature/high humidity conditions, and room temperature. Various operating conditions were also considered, such as charging–discharging, operating, and storage. The test results showed that the capacitance of the wound polymer aluminum capacitor degradedwith charging–discharging at low temperature. At lower temperatures, this characteristic accelerated butwasmitigatedwith a dry electrolyte. The degraded capacitances partially recovered when the capacitors were stored at a high temperature. These characteristics were not observed for a conventional liquid aluminum capacitor. This unreported special characteristic of polymer aluminum capacitors should be considered when designing systems such as power electronics. Polymer capacitors are known for their high reliability, especially at high temperatures. At low temperatures, however, the charging–discharging characteristic should be carefully considered. This paper reports on this characteristic of polymer capacitors for consideration by industries. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	polymer capacitor;power electronics	Unyong Jeong;J. P. Hyung;Y. G.

In this contribution, we introduce a novel sensor platform that can measure spiked neurotransmitter concentrations in whole blood samples in a fast and low-cost manner by combining synthetic receptors with a thermal readout technique-the heat-transfer method. In addition, the design of a miniaturized version of the sensing platform is presented that aims to bridge the gap between measurements in a laboratory setting and point-of-care measurements. This fully automated and integrated, user-friendly design features a capillary pumping unit that is compatible with point-of-care sampling techniques such as a blood lancet device (sample volume-between 50 µL and 300 µL). Sample pre-treatment is limited to the addition of an anti-coagulant. With this fully integrated setup, it is possible to successfully discriminate serotonin from a competitor neurotransmitter (histamine) in whole blood samples. This is the first demonstration of a point-of-care ready device based on synthetic receptors for the screening of neurotransmitters in complex matrices, illustrating the sensor's potential application in clinical research and diagnosis of e.g., early stage depression.	anti-aliasing filter;blood - brain barrier anatomy;blood specimen;buffers;coagulants;duoxa1 gene;depressive disorder;dynamic range;eighty;html;hands-on computing;heat stress disorders;histamine;lancet;limited stage (cancer stage);liquid chromatography;mafip gene;macrophage inflammatory proteins;mental disorders;neurotransmitters;point-of-care systems;preparation;pumping (computer systems);receptors, artificial;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;selectivity (electronic);serotonin;shot transition detection;solutions;spatial variability;synthetic intelligence;syringes;usability;venous blood sampling;vitamin d3 receptor;pump (device)	Thijs Vandenryt;Bart van Grinsven;Kasper Eersels;Peter Cornelis;Safira Kholwadia;Thomas Jan Cleij;Ronald Thoelen;Ward De Ceuninck;Marloes Peeters;Patrick Wagner	2017		10.3390/s17122701	analytical chemistry;serotonin;blood lancet;neurotransmitter;biomedical engineering;whole blood;synthetic receptors;chemistry	ML	95.32330317814629	-19.19521757289898	53988
1add1c37376dc8ac150f04de04cab61a326350b5	preliminary approach to estimation and prediction of infrared spectroscopy for mannich bases by atomic electronegativity distance vector (vaed)	multiple linear regression;mannich base;molecular modeling;standard deviation;infrared spectroscopy ir;spectrum;quantitative structure spectrum relationship qssr;satisfiability;atomic electronegativity distance vector vaed;vibration frequency;cross validation;infrared spectroscopy;correlation coefficient;leave one out;molecular structure	Systematical studies were made on infrared spectroscopy (IR) and its regularity of vibration frequency. By applying a novel molecular structural descriptor vector containing four elements, called atomic electronegativity (EN) distance vector (VAED) expressed in the form of force, to characterize the chemical environment of various atoms in Mannich bases, the quantitative relationship models of IR of Mannich bases were established with respect to their VAED descriptors, based on multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis. In order to demonstrate the modeling stabilities and predictive abilities of diverse models, a cross validation (CV) with the leave-one-out (LOO) procedure was performed for each modeling equation. For the first panel of the 17 examined analogous Mannich bases, the correlation coefficient (R) between the observed and estimated vibration frequencies and standard deviation (S.D.) both for the double covalent bonds, C, O ami Pz.sbnd;O are 0.9782, 0.9817, 9.1170 and 11.0649; and the corresponding R and S.D. obtained by the CV method are 0.9496, 0.8829, 14.1186 and 27.2829, respectively, which shows that the quantitative structure-spectrum relationship (QSSR) models are quite stable and have both good estimative results and fine predictive capabilities. For the second panel of the 16 examined Mannich bases, the results still seem satisfied since the QSSR model is stable and could roughly estimate and predict the vibration frequency of the Cz.dbnd6;O bond for the other related Mannich bases.

The present invention has one or more spring-loaded members located on the bottom of the cartridge which are coupled to the cartridge but movable with respect to it and which are separate from the rotatable hub assembly to which the magnetic disc is clamped within the cartridge. The spring-loaded member or members press in an axial direction against a surface on the hub to force together the overlapping sealing surfaces on the hub and the cartridge, thus sealing the cartridge and preventing the hub assembly and magnetic disc from rotating when the cartridge is not in use. When the cartridge is inserted into a disc-drive assembly, release pins overcome the spring-loading of the member or members and allow the sealing surface on the hub assembly and cartridge to separate. The hub assembly and disc may thus be rotated as they are no longer in contact with any part of the cartridge. Also clean air is permitted to circulate from the disc-drive assembly into the cartridge through the opening created by the separation of the sealing surfaces.

It is based on adding parallel plate comb drives to the points of maximum vibration amplitude, and tuning the stiffness of the combs. This increases the drive strength and results in a significant sensitivity improvement. The architecture is targeted for technologies with ~100 nm transducer gaps in order to achieve very high performance devices. In this work, this sensitivity enhancement concept was implemented in SOIMUMPs, a commercial relatively large gap technology. Prototypes were measured to operate at frequencies of ~1.5 MHz, with quality factors of ~33,000, at a 10 mTorr vacuum level. Measurements using discrete electronics show a rate sensitivity of 0.31 μV/°/s, corresponding to a capacitance sensitivity of 0.43 aF/°/s/electrode, two orders of magnitude higher than a similar design without combs, fabricated in the same technology.	gyro;gyroscope;microelectromechanical systems;normal mode;transducer	Mohannad Elsayed;Frederic Nabki;Mourad N.

The memory further includes a plurality of redundant loops, and second input and output paths for propagating magnetic bubbles to and from the redundant loops, respectively. A pair of bubble generators are provided for simultaneously generating the same input data stream on both the first and second input paths. By selectively disabling certain first transfer gates associated with the data loops magnetic bubbles are prevented from being transferred into defective ones of the data loops. By selectively enabling certain second transfer gates and certain second replicate gates, magnetic bubbles representing the same information as those not transferred into the data loops can be stored and retrieved from the redundant loops. Magnetic bubbles replicated from the redundant loops are merged into corresponding vacant positions in the output data stream propagated from the data loops before the stream reaches a bubble detector. The gates are selectively disabled or enabled by opening one of two parallel connected conductor segments in each of the gates.	interaction	L.

With the advances in miniaturization of these platforms, there is a need for solutions to integrate various optical components in order to build sensors, which will offer different detection characteristics such as several emission and sensing wavelengths. Moreover, the integration of an electrochemical sensor including a transparent electrode that will be compatible with the optical sensor represents an additional challenge. In this perspective, organic optoelectronic devices combined with silver nanowire electrodes could be a solution. The integration of a fluorescent sensor and an electrochemical oxygen sensor into a microfluidic platform and the different characteristics, advantages and disadvantages that offer organic light-emitting diodes (OLED), organic photodetectors (OPD) and silver nanowire electrodes are discussed. Finally, an example of the integration of an optical and an electrochemical sensor into a microfluidic chip for water pollution detection will be described.	dna integration;diode;emergence;microfluidics;miniaturization;nanowires;oled;optical devices;oxygen sensor device component;silver;solutions;electrode;sensor (device);wavelength	Sujittra Poorahong;Florent Lefevre;Marie-Claude Perron;Philippe Juneau;Ricardo Izquierdo	2016	2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591361	electronic engineering;microfluidics;oled;fluorescence;sensor;optoelectronics;silver;nanotechnology;nanowire;physics;algae	Robotics	94.10180752623766	-17.73919161831214	54510
a0dbabb891a9b0a914465c221e9867b498e0dfea	crack's detection, measuring and counting for resistance's tests using images		Currently, material resistance research is looking for biomaterials where mechanical properties (like fatigure resistance) and biocompatibility are the main characteristics to take into account. To understand the behavior of materials subject to fatigue, usually we analyze how the material responds to cyclic forces. Failures due to fatigue are the first cause of cracks in materials. Normally, failures start with a superficial deficiency and produce micro cracks, which grow until a total break of the material. In this work we deal with the early detection of micro cracks on the surface of bone cement, while they are under fatigue tests, in order to characterize the material and design better and more resistant materials according to where they would be applied. The method presented for crack detection consists in several stages: noise reduction, shadow elimination, image segmentation and path detection for crack analysis. At the end of the analysis of one image, the number of cracks and the length of each one can be obtained (based on the maximum length of crack candidates). If a video is analyzed, the evolution of cracks in the material can be observed.

From the magnetic field expression, simple analytical formulas are derived for computing the pull-out torque and the torsional stiffness of the coupling as a function of the geometrical parameters. Here, a special attention is given to the overload torque condition during the transient which leads to the loss of synchronism for the coupling. Moreover, radial and angular misalignment conditions are also studied. In order to study the accuracy of the proposed analytical model, the results are compared with those obtained from 3-D finite-element simulations and measurements.	angularjs;approximation;inductive coupling;performance;radial (radio);simulation;steady state	Thierry Lubin;Smail Mezani;Abderrezak Rezzoug	2014	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2013.2266087	classical mechanics;electronic engineering;magnetic field;mathematics;nuclear magnetic resonance;physics;approximation theory	Visualization	85.71814668462729	-8.737533169663283	54517

Two types of hydrophobic zeolite pellets are used as adsorbent. The ac 60 Hz and 20 kHz high voltage power supplies are employed for nonthermal plasma generation. After p-xylene or xylene mixture which consists of o-, m- and p-xylene is adsorbed by adsorbent for 130 min, nonthermal plasma is generated in order to decompose adsorbed xylene with gas circulation. For p-xylene, the conversion ratios of adsorbed xylene to CO and CO2 (etacox) reach 43% for ac 60 Hz plasma and 70% for ac 20 kHz plasma during 60 min treatment and then the energy efficiencies (Ed) are 0.26 and 0.75 g/kWh, respectively. As for xylene mixture, etacox of 69 and 48% are obtained by ac 60 Hz plasma for 90 min and ac 20 kHz plasma for 75 min, and Ed are 0.27 and 0.43 g/kWh. Ac 20 kHz plasma is better energy efficiency than that of ac 60 Hz plasma, however, ac 20 kHz plasma is unstable and generates NOx as byproduct. From FTIR analysis of exhaust gas after treatment, it is clarified that N2O is generated by ac 60 Hz plasma.	control theory;maxima and minima;multistage interconnection networks;plasma active;power supply	Tomoyuki Kuroki;Kiyoyuki Hirai;Ryouhei Kawabata;Masaaki Okubo;Toshiaki Yamamoto	2008	2008 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting	10.1109/08IAS.2008.118	chemistry;analytical chemistry;waste management	Robotics	95.06858365884806	-12.340395389515065	55084
c2f00727e67201e592789e3cad52798abb728791	digital quantum batteries: energy and information storage in nanovacuum tube arrays	vacuum tube;battery	Dielectric material between capacitor electrodes increases the capacitance. However, when the electric field exceeds a threshold, electric breakdown in the dielectric discharges the capacitor suddenly and the stored energy is lost. We show that nano vacuum tubes do not have this problem because (i) electric breakdown can be suppressed with quantization phenomena, and (ii) the capacitance is large at small gap sizes. We find that the energy density and power density in nano vacuum tubes are large compared to lithium batteries and electrochemical capacitors. The electric field in a nano vacuum tube can be sensed with MOSFETs in the insulating walls. Random access arrays of nano vacuum tubes with an energy gate, to charge the tube, and an information gate attached to the MOSFET, to sense the electric field in the tube, can be used to store both energy and information.

This work presents a novel variable stiffness structure consisting of a fiber-constrained dielectric elastomer tube filled with insulating oil. The tensile stiffness of the structure can be adjusted by voltages and its initial value can be customized according to the initial pre-stretch of the material. The structure has a dimension of ∼30 mm diameter × 50 mm length. A mathematical analysis is established to predict the initial tensile stiffness of the structure. The changes of the tensile stiffness of the structure under voltages are verified experimentally. The results show a decrease of the tensile stiffness of the device by 25% at 4 kV and the decrement is also related to the elongation of the structure. With different pre-stretches and dimensions of the dielectric elastomer, one can obtain devices with different variation ranges of tensile stiffness.	experiment;high-κ dielectric;increment and decrement operators;stiffness matrix	Tao Wang;Yue Li;Yuanjie Li;Jinhua Zhang;Jun Hong;Michael Yu Wang	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	10.1109/ICRA.2018.8461245	control theory;hydrostatic skeleton;elastomer;dielectric;engineering;stiffness;ultimate tensile strength;composite material	Robotics	88.77108489820093	-16.3639057179284	55130

The aim is to explain the appearance of a minimum value on the activation energy/molar mass curve of the PAHs. Rate constants are approximated using spectral moment expansion. It is shown that the size of the PAHs determines more than 95% of the extraction rate. Activation energy for the extraction of the PAHs was found to increase with increasing molar mass. The appearance of a minimum value on the activation energy/molar mass curve is the consequence of experimental difficulties resulting from the tendency of lower members of the PAHs to sublime.	aromatics;approximation algorithm;aromatic-l-amino-acid decarboxylases;coal tar;greater than;hydrocarbons;kinetics;molecular mass;polycyclic hydrocarbons, aromatic;sublime text	Svetlana Markovic;Zoran Markovic;Johan P.

3f386d7fc50af4affa39a7547d2054518660bfb9	improved electron-conformational method of pharmacophore identification and bioactivity prediction. application to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors	angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor	The electron-conformational (EC) method of pharmacophore (Pha) identification and bioactivity prediction, suggested earlier, is given here two major improvements. First, an atomic index of orbital and charge controlled interaction is introduced to better represent the ligand (substrate) in its interaction with the bioreceptor. Second, the multiconformational problem is considered in view of ligand-receptor binding states, resulting in essential simplification of the expression of bioactivity. The details of the improved EC method are demonstrated in application to the problem of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The Pha of the latter is identified by separation of the heavily populated conformations of the chosen 51 compounds (the training set), calculation of the electronic structure, construction of their EC matrixes of congruity, and processing of the latter in comparison with the activities to reveal a common submatrix of all the active only compounds that describes the Pha. The latter contains three oxygen atoms plus a fourth atom X = S, N, O at certain interatomic distances and with restricted electronic parameters (within assumed tolerances), the position of the atom X being more changeable from one active compound to another. For quantitative prediction of the bioactivity, an expression is deduced which takes into account the duly parametrized influence of auxiliary groups (AG) which, being positioned outside the Pha, either diminish the activity (antipharmacophore shielding) or enhance it. It is shown that in case of many conformations of the same compound only one of them, that of the lowest energy which has the Pha, should be parametrized. The 15 parameters chosen to represent the AG in case of ACE inhibitors are weighted by variational (adjustable) coefficients which are determined from a regression treatment of the calculated versus known activities in the training set. Then the formulas with known coefficients are used to validate the method by calculating the bioactivity of other compounds not used in the training set. The prediction of the activity proved to be more than 90% (within experimental error and available compounds) qualitatively (yes, no) and about 60%-70% quantitatively.	ace;angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors;angiotensins;assumed;atom;calculus of variations;coefficient;distance;electron;electronic structure;greater than;interatomic potential;level of detail;ligands;molecular orbital;oxygen;pharmacophore;phytohemagglutinins;population;test set	Isaac B.

c9cf8a43772ae7fa775b7d559280642b32818d9a	contribution to certain physical and numerical aspects of the study of the heat transfer in a granular medium. (contribution à certains aspects physiques et numériques de l'étude du transfert de chaleur dans un milieu granulaire)		In this work, we are interested in studying heat and mass transfer in water saturated and unsaturated porous medium with a strong heating at the surface. Applications concerned are archaeology, agriculture and geothermal engineering. The rst part of this work concerns the improvement of the AHC (Apparent Heat Capacity) method used in the numerical resolution of phase change problem in a homogeneous medium: the phase change temperature interval, over which the heat capacity varies, appears as a key parameter which must be chosen proportional to the mesh size. Accurate and smooth results are obtained thanks to a local re nement of the mesh near the phase change interface. The second part is about the estimation of the thermophysical properties of the soil by inverse problem using both synthetic and experimental data. The Damped GaussNewton and the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithms are used to solve the problem. In relation with the AHC method, the choice of the phase change temperature interval caused convergence problems which have been xed by chaining many inverse problems. The obtained results show good convergence to the desired solution. The third part presents a simple model to calculate the e ective thermal conductivity of a granular medium which contains a small quantity of liquid water. The exact shape of the liquid menisci between the grains is calculated at equilibrium. The e ective thermal conductivity experiences a hysteresis behavior with respect to the liquid volume. A future work that concerns a new unsaturated model, restricted to the pendular regime and detailed at the end of this thesis, should be able to use this result.

941bbcf46278ef293ddaf7fd649c359c15fdbeb1	thermoelectrics of interacting nanosystems - exploiting superselection instead of time-reversal symmetry		Thermoelectric transport is traditionally analyzed using relations imposed by time-reversal symmetry, ranging from Onsager’s results to fluctuation relations in counting statistics. In this paper, we show that a recently discovered duality relation for fermionic systems – deriving from the fundamental fermion-parity superselection principle of quantum many-particle systems – provides new insights into thermoelectric transport. Using a master equation, we analyze the stationary charge and heat currents through a weakly coupled, but strongly interacting single-level quantum dot subject to electrical and thermal bias. In linear transport, the fermion-parity duality shows that features of thermoelectric response coefficients are actually dominated by the average and fluctuations of the charge in a dual quantum dot system, governed by attractive instead of repulsive electron-electron interaction. In the nonlinear regime, the duality furthermore relates most transport coefficients to much better understood equilibrium quantities. Finally, we naturally identify the fermion-parity as the part of the Coulomb interaction relevant for both the linear and nonlinear Fourier heat. Altogether, our findings hence reveal that next to time-reversal, the duality imposes equally important symmetry restrictions on thermoelectric transport. As such, it is also expected to simplify computations and clarify the physical understanding for more complex systems than the simplest relevant interacting nanostructure model studied here.	coefficient;complex systems;computation;electron;elementary particle;interaction;multi-level cell;nonlinear system;particle system;quantum dot;quantum fluctuation;stationary process;superselection;t-symmetry	Jens Schulenborg;Angelo Di Marco;Joren Vanherck;Maarten R.

The patterns of the oil-water flow in a vertical well are classified into five patterns, i.e., pure oil phase, pure water phase, water-in-oil, oil-in-water, and transition. The conductance probe records the time-varying electrical characteristics of the oil- water flow, which is referred to as the original signals. Various features are extracted to characterize each original signal. The features are first treated through principal component analysis (PCA) to decrease data redundancy in the original features. A nonlinear SVC model is then established to map the PCA-treated features into a flow pattern. To identify the flow pattern, it can be voted by an individual probe or by probe combinations. Experiments were carried out in a vertical pipe with an inner diameter of 125 mm and a height of 24 m on the industrial-scale experimental multiphase flow setup in Daqing Oilfield, China. In the experiment, the oil-water two-phase flow was tested and the total flow rate was varied from 10 to 200 m3 per day, equivalent to 0.0094 to 0.1886 m · s-1, and the water cut was varied from 0% to 100%. The results obtained demonstrate that the developed probe array-based instrument can increase the reliability of flow pattern recognition, compared with the single probe-based instrument. The identification accuracy obtained using the optimal probe combination and the proposed method is 97.95% ± 2.01% (mean ± std), and higher than that obtained using a single probe and the SVC model.	conductance (graph);data redundancy;experiment;nonlinear system;optical fiber;pattern recognition;principal component analysis;support vector machine;traffic enforcement camera;two-phase commit protocol;two-phase locking;vertical bar	Lijun Xu;Jianjun Chen;Zhang Cao;Wen Zhang;Ronghua Xie;Xingbin Liu;Jinhai Hu	2016	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2016.2537498	electronic engineering;feature extraction;computer science;engineering;machine learning;telemetry;resistance;engineering drawing;principal component analysis	Vision	89.23126850861478	-20.55232670243968	55936

The instrument is composed by a sensor array, based on both electrochemical and chemoresistive low-cost sensors, a measurement chamber, a custom front end electronics, and a PC-based acquisition and processing system. Specific processing algorithms have been designed to compensate problems such as sensor drift, sensor cross sensitivity to different gases, and dependence of the sensor response on temperature and humidity.	sensor	Tommaso Addabbo;Francesco Bardi;Stefano Cioncolini;Ada Fort;Marco Mugnaini;Lorenzo Parri;Valerio Vignoli	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-93082-4_7	spectrum analyzer;calibration;electronics;automotive engineering;sensor array;accuracy and precision;system of measurement;exhaust gas;front and back ends;computer science	ML	92.89677048055576	-19.78671837600319	56095

Here, Brownian transport is studied in micro-sized, two-dimensional periodic channels, exhibiting periodically varying cross-sections. The particles in addition are subjected to an external force acting alongside the direction of the longitudinal channel axis. For a fixed channel geometry, the dynamics of the two-dimensional problem is characterized by a single dimensionless parameter which is proportional to the ratio of the applied force and the temperature of the particle environment. In such structures entropic effects may play a dominant role. Under certain conditions the two-dimensional dynamics can be approximated by an effective one-dimensional motion of the particle in the longitudinal direction. The Langevin equation describing this reduced, one-dimensional process is of the type of the Fick-Jacobs equation. It contains an entropic potential determined by the varying extension of the eliminated channel direction, and a correction to the diffusion constant that introduces a space dependent diffusion. Different forms of this correction term have been suggested before, which we here compare for a particular class of models. We analyze the regime of validity of the Fick-Jacobs equation, both by means of analytical estimates and the comparisons with numerical results for the full two-dimensional stochastic dynamics. For the nonlinear mobility we find a temperature dependence which is opposite to that known for particle transport in periodic potentials. The influence of entropic effects is discussed for both, the nonlinear mobility and the effective diffusion constant.	approximation algorithm;brownian motion;estimated;exhibits as topic;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;optic axis of a crystal;population parameter;stochastic process	P.

Our group has developed stimuli-responsive hydrogel microsprings (SR springs) for mugnifying the shrink/swell movements. The SR springs, made of composite hydrogel of p(NIPAM-co-AAc) and calcium alginate, were continuously formed by using a bevel-tip capillary. By stimulating single-layered or patterned SR springs, we achieved to magnify the shrink/swell movements and to control the direction of the movements.	as-interface;composite video;shrink wrap contract	Hiroaki Onoe	2017	2017 International Symposium on Micro-NanoMechatronics and Human Science (MHS)	10.1109/MHS.2017.8305193	analytical chemistry;calcium alginate;capillary action;microfiber;materials science;swell;composite material	Robotics	94.22462553466706	-16.327273649788555	56471

On electrochemical reduction of the di-n-heptyl viologen di-cation, the purple di-n-heptyl viologen radical cation salt deposits as a film and the changes in hue and saturation have been tracked using CIE 1931 xy chromaticity coordinates. The CIELAB 1976 colour space coordinates of the purple di-n-heptyl viologen radical cation salt were L* = 76, a* = 33 and b* = –20, with a complementary wavelength of 548 nm. A sharp decrease in luminance was found on formation of the di-n-heptyl viologen radical cation salt. Colour coordinates for the reverse (oxidation) direction plots show hysteresis, implying that specific choice of colour values depends on both the potential applied and from which direction the potential is changed.

9c971405fbcef72bd6df25091ab7147919ebf065	a variable degree-of-freedom and self-sensing soft bending actuator based on conductive liquid metal and thermoplastic polymer composites		This paper presents a soft actuator embedded with conductive liquid metal and shape memory epoxy (SME) which function together to enable self-sensing, tunable mechanical degrees of freedom (DoF), and variable stiffness. We embedded thermoplastic shape memory epoxy in the bottom portion of the actuator. Different sections of the SME could be selectively softened by an implanted conductive silver yarn located at different positions. When an electric current passes through the conductive silver yarn, it induces a phase transition that changes the epoxy from stiff state to compliant state. Each section of SME could be softened within 5 s by applying a current of 200 mA to the silver yarn. To acquire the strain curvature, eGaIn was infused into a microchannel surrounding the chambers of the soft actuator. A spiral-shaped eGaIn sensor was also attached to the tip of the actuator to perceive the contact with reliable dynamic force response. Systematic experiments were performed to characterize the stiffness, tunable DoF, and sensing property. We show the ability of the soft composite actuator to support a weight of 200g at the tip (as a cantilever) while maintaining the shape and the ability to recover its original shape after large bending deformation. In particular, seven different motion patterns could be achieved under the same pneumatic pressure of the actuator due to selectively heating the SME sections. A gripper which was fabricated by assembling two actuators to a base was able to grasp the weight up to 56 times of a single actuator through an appropriate motion pattern. For demonstration purposes, the gripper was used to grasp various objects by adjusting the DoF and stiffness with real-time feedback of the bending strain and the contact force.

On the basis of this relationship, a criterion for obtaining basis sets of moderate size with a high degree of fulfillment of the theorem is proposed. As an illustrative application, previously reported Slater basis sets are extended by using this criterion. The resulting augmented basis sets are tested on several molecules finding that the differences between energy gradient and electrostatic forces are reduced by at least one order of magnitude.

7b7f404c863c684abaf3bb4ab4ad0188209fdb74	generalized classification scheme of toroidal and helical carbon nanotubes	carbon nanotube	In this study, we develop a generalized classification scheme for toroidal (TCNT) and helical carbon nanotubes (HCNT) containing both pentagons and heptagons simultaneously. We show that a particular class of TCNTs with n-fold rotational symmetry and well-defined latitude coordinates can be uniquely characterized by a set of four indices, and each of the indices can be linked to the relative arrangement of pentagons and heptagons in the corresponding torus. Chiral isomers or the corresponding helical derivatives, HCNTs, can also be readily derived either by introducing a chiral vector or dissecting a distorted TCNT through certain longitude. This generalized scheme can generate the whole family of fullerenes with genus one, ranging from giant TCNTs down to small ones containing only a few hundred atoms. To the best of our knowledge, almost all of the construction methods for TCNTs in the literature belong to special cases of our generalized classification scheme.	carbon monoxide poisoning;cellular automaton;chirality (chemistry);comparison and contrast of classification schemes in linguistics and metadata;fullerenes;genus (mathematics);isomerism;latitude:angle:point in time:cancer.to be specified in another part of the message:quantitative;nanotubes;nanotubes, carbon;tomography, spiral computed;toroidal graph	Chern Chuang;Yuan-Chia Fan;Bih-Yaw Jin	2009	Journal of chemical information and modeling	10.1021/ci800395r	carbon nanotube;chemistry;topology;nanotechnology;mathematics;geometry	ECom	98.27420797640112	-9.382822793075555	56852

It is unwieldy to use all these true compounds in any rigorous simulator to get the actual picture of the plant operations. To attain a quantitative description of the phase equilibrium of such mixtures, a novel shortcut method, which is, based on only one reference component and the ratio of the adjacent distribution coefficients for homologous family has been developed. At a particular temperature the recursive ratios of the distribution coefficients in a homologous family indicate a fixed value on the main branch. The dependency of relative distribution coefficients on temperature and solvent to feed ratio has been estimated. For all the PIONA families, exponentially distributed feed has been used in the AspenPlus simulator to calculate the distribution coefficients K. The shortcut PIONA liquid–liquid extraction (LLX) simulation program has been trained using the above distribution coefficients to obtain the relative distribution parameter β. For testing PIONA LLX proposition, single stage liquid–liquid extraction experiments for gamma (continuous) and random (discrete) distributed feeds were done. n-Paraffin, naphthene and aromatic families were investigated independently. The single stage PIONA approach has been extended to the multistage extraction column. The multistage PIONA shortcut results have also been compared with rigorous simulation results and they match closely. It reduces the computational time by an order of magnitude. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

de678e67c1cf842034a0b06e1e163422e01a32b5	micro-shaft-poking - a novel instrument for mechanically characterizing soft biomimetic membrance		Characterizing viscoelastic properties of soft biomimetic membranes has become increasingly important due to their biomedical applications such as tissue engineering/regenerative medicine and biosensors. This paper presents a new micro-shaft-poking (MSP) technique which is free from the complication of substrate backing, normally occurred as an intractable problem in the conventional indentation testing for soft membranes. A tailored indention apparatus with a spherical indenter was constructed to achieve the force resolution and displacement of 1μN and 1μm. The biomimetic membranes which were used for mechanical testing were made of two types of hydrogel, alginate and agarose. The results showed that the elastic modulus increased with gel concentration. A creep test has also been conducted to examine the timedependent behaviors of various hydrogel and a viscoelastic model has been correspondingly developed and applied to describe the experimental results. Other potential applications of this new instrument to other membranes, both artificial and biological, have been addressed in the paper.	biomimetics;computational complexity theory;displacement mapping;instruction creep;linear programming relaxation;max;modulus robot;skin (computing)	Kuo-Kang Liu;Mark Ahearne;Eleftherios Siamantouras;Ying Yang	2008			electronic engineering;boiler (power generation);engineering;vaporization;cyclone;separator (oil production);cylinder;mechanical engineering	Robotics	92.70901439577177	-16.74691715822164	57403

Tissue disruption is reported to be caused by repetitive mechanical contact and cavitation. This work focuses on the effects of vibrating wire waveguides in contact with arterial tissue. An apparatus with clinically relevant parameters was used, characterized as operating at 22.5 kHz and delivering amplitudes of vibration of 17.8-34.3 μm (acoustic intensity, ISATA: 1.03-3.83 W/cm2) via 1.0-mm diameter waveguides. Inertial cavitation (in water at 37 °C) was deter- mined to occur above amplitudes of vibration greater than 31.4 μm (ISATA = 3.21 W/cm2). The energized waveguides were advanced through tissue samples (porcine aorta) and the force profiles were measured for a range of acoustic intensities. The results show that the tissue perforation initiation force, perforation initiation energy, and total energy required to perforate the tissue reduces with increasing acoustic intensity. No significant reduction in perforation force or energy was observed in the inertial cavitation region. Multistage perforation was evident through the force profile and histological examination of the tissue samples post wire waveguide perforation.	ablation;acoustic cryptanalysis;anatomic structures;aorta;body tissue;cognitive function: initiation;denial-of-service attack;diameter (qualifier value);kilohertz;less than;medical device material perforation;mined;multistage amplifier;obstruction;offset binary;ultrasonography, prenatal;vibration - physical agent;waveguide device component;wire wrap;soft tissue	Mark P.

Birefringence is a property of many types of tissue, which decreases with damage. Using a polarisation-sensitive optical coherence tomography scanner, the method first acquires a 3D scan of the area of tissue under analysis. By calculating the birefringence at each location on the surface of the tissue, we build a 2D image indicative of the biological microstructure, with areas of abnormally low birefringence indicating tissue damage. The technique is demonstrated using a model of localised thermal damage on porcine tendon. The resulting birefringence images are validated against a histological gold standard, showing strong correspondence between areas of low and high birefringence, and areas of damaged and undamaged tissue respectively.	birefringence;image sensor;tendon-driven robot;tomography	Lixin Chin;Xiaojie Yang;Robert A.

In this paper we describe Universal Ventricular Coordinates (UVC), which can be used to describe position within any biventricular heart. UVC comprise four unique coordinates that we have chosen to be intuitive, well defined, and relevant for physiological descriptions. We describe how to determine these coordinates for any volumetric mesh by illustrating how to properly assign boundary conditions and utilize solutions to Laplace's equation. Using UVC, we transferred scalar, vector, and tensor data between four unstructured ventricular meshes from three different species. Performing the mappings was very fast, on the order of a few minutes, since mesh nodes were searched in a KD tree. Distance errors in mapping mesh nodes back and forth between meshes were less than the size of an element. Analytically derived fiber directions were also mapped across meshes and compared, showing  < 5° difference over most of the ventricles. The ability to transfer gradients was also demonstrated. Topologically variable structures, like papillary muscles, required further definition outside of the UVC framework. In conclusion, UVC can aid in transferring many types of data between different biventricular geometries.		Jason D. Bayer;Anton J. Prassl;Ali Pashaei;Juan F.

This paper presents a low temperature wafer direct bonding process assisted by O2 plasma. Silicon wafers were treated with wet chemical cleaning and subsequently activated by O2 plasma in the etch element of a sputtering system. Then, two wafers were brought into contact in the bonder followed by annealing in N2 atmosphere for several hours. An infrared imaging system was used to detect bonding defects and a razor blade test was carried out to determine surface energy. The bonding yield reaches 90%–95% and the achieved surface energy is 1.76 J/m2 when the bonded wafers are annealed at 350 °C in N2 atmosphere for 2 h. Void formation was systematically observed and elimination methods were proposed. The size and density of voids greatly depend on the annealing temperature. Short O2 plasma treatment for 60 s can alleviate void formation and enhance surface energy. A pulling test reveals that the bonding strength is more than 11.0 MPa. This low temperature wafer direct bonding process provides an efficient and reliable method for 3D integration, system on chip, and MEMS packaging.	dicing;debian;direct bonding;emoticon;integrated circuit;microelectromechanical systems;plasma active;plasma cleaning;plasma display;plasma-activated bonding;plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition;radio frequency;razor;silicon on insulator;simulated annealing;system on a chip;wafer bonding	Dong-ling Li;Zheng-guo Shang;Sheng-qiang Wang;Zhi-yu Wen	2013	Journal of Zhejiang University SCIENCE C	10.1631/jzus.C12MNT02	anodic bonding;thermocompression bonding;computer science	Robotics	92.29327597863895	-13.641368852142914	57925

With the move towardsIndustry 4.0 and cyber-physical systems, demands for cost-effective sensors are rapidly increasing. Conventional sensors used for monitoring manufacturing processes are often bulky and need complex processes. In this study, a novel high-sensitive nanocomposite-based sensor is developed for measuring strain. The developed sensor is comprised of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) as a piezoelectric polymer matrix, and embedded carbon nanotube (CNT) nanoparticles creating a conductive network. Exhibiting both piezoelectric and piezoresistive properties, the developed sensors are capable of strain measurement over a wide frequency band, including static and dynamic measurements. The piezoresistive and piezoelectric properties are fused to improve the overall sensitivity and frequency bandwidth of the sensor. To simulate the sensor, a 3D random walk model and a 2D finite element (FE) model are used to predict the electrical resistivity and the piezoelectric characteristics of the sensor, respectively. The developed models are verified with the experimental results. The developed nanocomposite sensors were employed for strain measurement of a cantilever beam under static load, impulse excitation, free and forced vibrations, collecting both piezoelectric and piezoresistive properties measurements. The obtained signals were fused and compared with those of a reference sensor.

It has been reported that the bioelectric potential of leaves changes at the beginning of steady irradiation and intensity of the potential response increases with the photosynthetic rate. Although it has been reported that photosynthesis is accelerated by blinking irradiation, the potential response under the blinking irradiation have not been fully clarified. In this study, we measured the bioelectric potential and CO 2  consumption of plants under various types of the blinking irradiation. This result showed that the potential response under the blinking irradiation has various behaviors and intensity of the response related to photosynthetic rate. We conclude that our method is suitable for monitoring the biological activity of plants such as photosynthesis.

The useful life of the mold stool is prolonged by providing a quantity of metal particles to fill the cavity and having a plate positioned over the cavity and metal particles, which plate is secured within the cavity by a ring that is within the relieved portion of the mold stool. This ring protects the periphery of the machined relieved portion from erosion during casting and also prevents the plate and metal particles from mingling with the cast metal. For each successive casting operation, the eroded cavity is filled with metal particles and a new plate is positioned thereover. Alternately, the use of metal particles may be avoided by using only a plate of a thickness sufficient to protect the remainder of the mold stool from erosion.	natural language	Igor P.

Although the advancements in computing power has now made possible to integrate ignition and combustion modeling, not many researchers have shown interest due to the wide scope of knowledge it needs in both plasma physics and combustion dynamics. In this paper, we are reporting a preliminary analysis of an integrated ignition+combustion model for both spark ignition (SI) and laser-induced spark ignition (LISI) combustion chambers. A common aspect of both SI and LISI is the use of equation-of-state (EOS) tables at temperatures up to 5 times higher than those assumed in most combustion codes. We report use of an atomic physics code to generate EOS tables needed for our combustion and ignition simulations.	apache spark;code;computer simulation;eos;plasma active	Osman Yasar	2001		10.1007/3-540-45545-0_126	laser;homogeneous charge compression ignition;fluid dynamics	Metrics	92.49383783680483	-5.072545889682806	58265

The feature of the CMOS-MEMS sensor is the use of gold proof mass. High density of gold enables us to increase sensitivity by reducing thermo-mechanical noise that is inversely proportional to proof mass. We then show the developed CMOS-MEMS multi-physics design environment. An equivalent circuit of a MEMS accelerometer has been designed to simultaneously understand both the mechanical and the electrical behaviors. One of the potential applications of the high sensitivity inertia sensor is also discussed by focusing on early-stage diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.	cmos;equivalent circuit;microelectromechanical systems;semiconductor;sensor	Kazuya Masu;Daisuke Yamane;Katsuyuki Machida;Masato Sone;Yoshihiro Miyake	2016	2016 46th European Solid-State Device Research Conference (ESSDERC)	10.1109/ESSCIRC.2016.7598252	gold;acceleration;electronic engineering;sensitivity;engineering;electrical engineering;nanotechnology;force;accelerometer;physics;quantum mechanics	EDA	90.57416590222049	-19.21284238502616	58316

This work shows that QTAIM-defined LIs describe a portion of interatomic delocalized electrons; hence, the chemical/physical interpretation of orthodox LIs is misleading. Using the recently introduced Fragment, Atomic, Localized, Delocalized, and Interatomic (FALDI) density decomposition technique we derive two novel sets of LIs and delocalization indices (DIs), by accounting for the overlap between localized and delocalized density functions. The FALDI-based LIs and DIs perfectly recover chemically expected core and bonded electron count. Usefulness of new (de)localization indices and their 3D representations were demonstrated on a number of examples, including formamide and benzene. We therefore expect that the scheme reported in this work will provide a valuable stepping stone between classical conceptual chemistry and quantum chemical topology. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

3ef3ec30ae3dbe3621008475d6dc8e02ffac0471	synthesis of au-sn alloy nanoparticles for lead-free electronics with unique combination of low and high melting temperatures		Au–Sn alloy nanoparticles (ANPs) with 16–67 wt% Sn were successfully synthesized in the size range of 2–10 nm using chemical reduction method. X-ray diffraction confirmed the formation of AuSn phase with hexagonal structure and was further validated by microscopy and spectroscopy techniques. Chemical reduction is a more scalable and economical technique relative to other synthesis methods for solder alloy particles; it can produce particles in nanoscale range and can be conducted at room temperature. A significant depression in the melting transition (starting from 187 C) was observed for the Au–Sn ANPs relative to the bulk eutectic point (Tm = 280 C at 30% Au). Au-Sn nanoparticles offer a unique set of advantages as lead-free soldering material. In nanoparticle state, they can reflow at lower temperatures leading to less thermal stresses in adjacent electronic components during the manufacturing process. After the initial reflow and solder joint formation (bulk state), they can reclaim bulk Au-Sn properties including permanent high melting temperatures (up to 420 C) which can potentially lead to superior thermal and mechanical performance suitable for high temperature electronic applications such as military and aerospace. 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis is based on the velocity jump process for describing the motion of individuals such as bacteria, wherein each individual carries an internal state that evolves according to a system of ordinary differential equations forced by a timeand/or space-dependent external signal. In the problem treated here the turning rate of individuals is a functional of the internal state, which in turn depends on the external signal. Using moment closure techniques in one space dimension, we derive and analyze a macroscopic system of hyperbolic differential equations describing this velocity jump process. Using a hyperbolic scaling of space and time, we obtain a single second-order hyperbolic equation for the population density, and using a parabolic scaling, we obtain the classical chemotaxis equation, wherein the chemotactic sensitivity is now a known function of parameters of the internal dynamics. Numerical simulations show that the solutions of the macroscopic equations agree very well with the results of Monte Carlo simulations of individual movement.	image scaling;monte carlo method;numerical linear algebra;parabolic antenna;population;simulation;velocity (software development)	Radek Erban;Hans G.

So we propose a prospective model of a solid state integrated circuit for quantum computation, based on our coherence generating dynamic dipole–dipole interaction theory. In this model, each qubit is a block consisting of an ensemble of quantum dots, and the energetics of which suggests stability up to room temperature. Moreover, a quantum controlled–controlled not (CCN) gate of the block structure is given as an essential unit. The spatiotemporal dynamics of the quantum entangled pure states, which is crucial for the execution of the quantum super-parallelism, is illustrated for the proposed quantum CCN gate.

We study the combined effect of death rate, sinking or buoyant coefficient, water column depth and vertical turbulent diffusion rate on the persistence of a single phytoplankton species. Under a general reproductive rate which is an increasing function of light intensity, we establish the existence of a critical death rate; i.e., the phytoplankton survives if and only if its death rate is less than the critical death rate. The critical death rate is a strictly monotone decreasing function of sinking or buoyant coefficient and water column depth, and it is also a strictly monotone decreasing function of turbulent diffusion rate for buoyant species. In contrast to critical death rate, critical sinking or buoyant velocity, critical water column depth and critical turbulent diffusion rate may or may not exist. For instance, it is shown that if the death rate is suitably small with respect to the water column depth, the phytoplankton can persist for any sinking or buoyant velocity; i.e., there is no critical sinking or buoyant velocity under such situation. We further show that critical water column depth, critical sinking or buoyant velocity and critical turbulent diffusion rate for buoyant species can exist for some intermediate range of phytoplankton death rates and, whenever they exist, are always unique. In strong contrast, we show that there may exist two critical turbulent diffusion rates for sinking species. The phytoplankton forms a thin layer at the surface of the water column for sufficiently large buoyant rate, and it forms a thin layer at the bottom of the water column for sufficiently large sinking rate. Precise characterizations of these thin layers are also given.	coefficient;nonlocal lagrangian;persistence (computer science);turbulence;velocity (software development);monotone	Sze-Bi Hsu;Yuan Lou	2010	SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics	10.1137/100782358	persistence	ML	85.3102927975801	2.2703009578045905	58849

However, both CVD fabrication process and necessary transfer process will introduce a lot of defects. Therefore, reducing the defects in CVD graphene is a critical problem. In this work, we report the annealing effect to reduce the defects in graphene fabricated by CVD and transferred to Si/SiO2 substrate. We annealed the CVD samples at five different temperatures in N2 for 30 s. The Raman spectroscopy shows the defects can be reduced in the range of 200°C to 600°C. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) also indicates a much smoother surface can be reached below 600°C. When the annealing temperature above 800°C, the average carbon-carbon distance increases with the temperature. This will lead to a larger corrugation which is one kind of defects. Thermal expansion generated by high temperature will also damage the graphene lattice structure and therefore produces more disorders.	atomic-force microscopy;chemical vapor deposition;crystal structure;graphene;physical vapor deposition;raman scattering;semiconductor device fabrication;simulated annealing;software bug	Y.

edf9d1948a5a169e729b56e1a0220c59cabf92bd	predictive modeling of machining residual stresses considering tool edge effects		The surface integrity of machined components is defined by several characteristics, of which residual stress is extremely important. Residual stress is known to have an effect on critical mechanical properties such as fatigue life, corrosion cracking resistance, and dimensional tolerance of machined components. Among the factors that affect residual stress in machined parts are cutting parameters and tool geometry. This paper presents a method of modeling residual stress for hone-edge cutting tools in turning. The model utilizes analytical cutting force models in conjunction with an approximate algorithm for elastic–plastic rolling/sliding contact. Oxley’s cutting force model is coupled with a slip line model proposed by Waldorf to estimate the cutting forces, which are in turn used to estimate the stress distribution between the tool and the workpiece. A rolling/sliding contact model, which captures kinematic hardening, is used to predict the machining residual stresses. Additionally, a moving heat source model is applied to determine the temperature rise in the workpiece due to the cutting forces. The model predictions are compared with experimental data for the turning of AISI 52100. Force predictions compare well with experimental results. Similarly, the predicted residual stress distributions correlate well with the measured residual stresses in terms of magnitude of stresses and depth of penetration.	predictive modelling	Jiann-Cherng Su;Keith A.

The operational principle relies on the fact that the addition of ethanol to the gasohol blend reduces the refractive index (RI) of the gasoline. Since MMI sensors are capable of detecting small RI changes, the ethanol content of the gasohol blend is easily determined by tracking the MMI peak wavelength response. Gasohol blends with ethanol contents ranging from 0% to 50% has been clearly identified using this device, which provides a linear response with a maximum sensitivity of 0.270 nm/% EtOH. The sensor can also distinguish when water incorporated in the blend has exceeded the maximum volume tolerated by the gasohol blend, which is responsible for phase separation of the ethanol and gasoline and could cause serious engine failures. Since the MMI sensor is straightforward to fabricate and does not require any special coating it is a cost effective solution for real time and in-situ monitoring of the quality of gasohol blends.	coating excipient;ethanol;gasoline;interference (communication);kidney failure;rs-232;refractive index;sensor;tissue fiber;contents - htmllinktype;wavelength	Adolfo J.

The electronic charges are partitioned among the water molecules using maximally localized Wannier functions. For water molecules confined to the interior of a carbon nanotube we find an average dipole moment of about 2.7 D, almost 10 % lower than the dipole moment of water molecules in the liquid phase calculated with the same method. The value of the water dipole moment in hydrogen bonded chains determines the effective interaction of excess protons and hydrogen bonding defects in the water chain. Using the dipole moment from our simulations we obtain an effective charge of 0.4e and -0.4e for the D-defect and the L-defect, respectively, and an effective charge of 0.6e for an excess proton in the chain.	ab initio quantum chemistry methods;hydrogen;molecular dynamics;offset binary;simulation;software bug;software defect indicator	Christoph Dellago;Mor M.

d67bc37c892dde1176f5bfbb333dd18a7baa6e2c	degradation mechanisms of heterogeneous iii-v/silicon loop-mirror laser diodes for photonic integrated circuits		Abstract This paper reports on the degradation processes of heterogeneous III-V/Silicon loop-mirrors laser-diodes designed as the optical sources for next-generation Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs) operating at 1.55 μm. By submitting the devices to a series of constant-current accelerated aging experiments we were able to identify a common set of degradation mechanisms, including: (i) an increase in threshold current, (ii) a decrease of the sub-threshold emission, (iii) a decrease in the operating voltage of the device and (iv) a small decrease in the slope-efficiency of the laser. The strong correlation between these degradation processes suggests that the loss in optical performance experienced by the devices can be attributed to a decrease in the non-radiative carrier lifetime, as a consequence of the generation/propagation of defects towards the active region of the laser diodes.	diode;elegant degradation;integrated circuit	Matteo Buffolo;M.

Error contributions from various error sources, such as repeatability errors, assembly errors of the probe volume and errors caused by the TDS system were evaluated with respect to discernibility and significance of measurement results. The most significant error source was due to modifications of the TDS setup, causing errors in the range of 0.13% of the refractive index for samples with a refractive index around 1.467 and a probe volume length between 5 and 15 mm at 1 THz. The absorption coefficient error was in the range of 8.49% for an absorption around 0.6 cm−1. While the average of measurements taken with different setup configurations did not yield significant differences for different TO times, a single, fixed setup would be able to discern all investigated oil species across the entire frequency range of 0.5⁻2.5 THz. The absorption coefficient measurement showed greater discernibility than the measurement of the refractive index.	alignment;cuvettes;coefficient;conceptualization (information science);confidence intervals;conflict (psychology);differential thermal analysis;digit structure;frequency band;gasoline;laboratory;preparation;repeatability;sumo activating enzyme complex;selective area epitaxy;small;terahertz;thermal grease;thermal oxidation	Mario Méndez Aller;Ali Mazin Abdul-Munaim;Dennis G.

The main objective is to identify insulation failures that may arise as hotspots in the structure. The method is based on temperature readings of fiber optic distributed sensors (DTS) and a sparse reconstruction algorithm. Thermal images of the structure are formed by appropriately combining atoms of a dictionary of hotspots, which was constructed by finite element simulation with a multi-physical model. Due to difficulties for reproducing insulation faults in real stator structure, experimental tests were performed using a prototype similar to the real structure. The results demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to reconstruct images of hotspots with dimensions down to 15 cm, representing a resolution gain of up to six times when compared to the DTS spatial resolution. In addition, satisfactory results were also obtained to detect hotspots with only 5 cm. The application of the proposed algorithm for thermal imaging of generator stators can contribute to the identification of insulation faults in early stages, thereby avoiding catastrophic damage to the structure.	algorithm;approximation algorithm;central pattern generators;dictionary;dictionary [publication type];dimensions;distributed temperature sensing;electroconvulsive therapy;experiment;fiber optic technology;finite element method;genetic hotspot;hotspot (wi-fi);image resolution;image sensor;insulation device component;iterative reconstruction;java hotspot virtual machine;microwave;noise (electronics);norm (social);numerous;operational availability;optical fiber;optics;passive optical network;prototype;raman scattering;reading (activity);short circuit;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;small;sparse matrix;positive regulation of response to dna damage checkpoint signaling;sensor (device)	João Paulo Bazzo;Daniel Rodrigues Pipa;Erlon Vagner da Silva;Cicero Martelli;Jean Carlos Cardozo da Silva	2016		10.3390/s16091425	control engineering;embedded system;electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;engineering drawing	Robotics	92.14548194275126	-20.953282941553915	59212

The main features of the new microgripper are fabrication technology (μEDM) and exploited material (superelastic alloy); the gripper was sensorized with commercial semiconductor strain-gauges and implemented in the force-feedback micromanipulation workstation developed in the authors’ laboratory. Both FEM simulation and results of experimental characterizations are presented. Introduction This microgripper was designed by exploiting the know-how acquired through previous activities on micromanipulation and microtools in the authors’ laboratory, when LIGA and laser machined grippers in nickel and steel were used [1]. The microgrippers fabricated in nickel by exploiting the LIGA technique were based on mechanical flexure joints; slightly different designs were used to obtain different mechanical performances. Essentially two different sets of microgrippers were fabricated: the average size of the microgrippers are 7 x 15 x 0.4 mm for the first set; and 10 x 25 x 0.2 mm for the second set. LIGA fabricated grippers were all actuated by PZT (high and low voltage) and were sensorized by commercial semiconductor strain-gauges in order to provide a force feedback signal to the operator [2]. After proper calibration the maximum forces generated by the gripper were 22 and 7 mN for the first and the second set, respectively [3,4]. As shown in Table 1 below, we compared the main features of the grippers with those of a commercial one (Bartels Mikrotechnik GmbH), devoted to similar applications.	discharger;feedback;finite element method;haptic technology;performance;robot end effector;semiconductor;simulation;workstation	Arianna Menciassi;Anna Eisinberg;Marcello Mazzoni;Paolo Dario	2002		10.1109/IRDS.2002.1043982	strain gauge;electrical discharge machining;engineering drawing;metallurgy	Robotics	86.59270436761375	-15.199488608677305	59333

The spectral range explored has been from the microwave, through the infrared (IR), visible and ultraviolet (UV), to X-ray, using both reflectance and fluorescence techniques, and in the case of X-rays also transmission spectroscopy. This work investigates the potential for uncovering inner structures of painted works of art on a macroscopic level by using standard medical X-ray equipment, more particularly multi-energy digital X-ray (transmission) radiographic imaging. Such X-ray images might also generate additional spectral channels to their IR-Vis-UV range counterparts. Although medical equipment X-ray sources generate a broad photonic spectrum, it turns out that there might still be valuable information in the X-ray spectrum.	coefficient;microwave;multispectral image;radiography;spectral method;thickness (graph theory);x-ray (amazon kindle)	Dag Waaler	2015	2015 Colour and Visual Computing Symposium (CVCS)	10.1109/CVCS.2015.7274901	visual arts;art;analytical chemistry;optics;spectral imaging	Graphics	96.25131988398267	-22.48785364278873	59411

This difference is puzzling, because the Shannon and Gibbs entropies have the same functional form. We show that a canonical change of variables can, indeed, alter the spatial component of the thermodynamic entropy just as it alters the differential Shannon entropy. However, there is also a momentum part of the entropy, which turns out to undergo an equal and opposite change when the coordinates are transformed, so that the total thermodynamic entropy remains invariant. We furthermore show how one may correctly write the change in total entropy for an isothermal physical process in any set of spatial coordinates.	differential entropy;entropy (information theory);gibbs' inequality;higher-order function;information theory;physical phenomenon or property;shannon (unit);thermodynamics	Vladimir Hnizdo;Michael K.

A novel ultrasound sensing system that does not require an optical filter is presented herein. Ultrasound could be detected via the application of signal processing techniques, such as signal averaging and frequency filters, to the photodetector output that corresponds to the intensity of the reflected light from a broadband light-illuminated FBG. Ultrasonic sensitivity was observed to be enhanced when an FBG was installed as a resonant sensor. This FBG ultrasound detection system is small and cheap to fabricate because it does not use a demodulating optical filter. The experimental results demonstrate that this system could be applied to ultrasonic damage inspection and acoustic emission measurements. Furthermore, this system was able to detect ultrasound despite the amount of strain or temperature that was applied to the FBG sensor because the ultrasound detection was not sensitive to the Bragg wavelength of the FBG sensor.	a fibers;acoustic cryptanalysis;aluminum measurement;fiber optic cables;fiber optic technology;fiber optic sensor;low-pass filter;optical fiber;photodetector device component;resonance;signal averaging;signal processing;tissue fiber;ultrasonics (sound);sensor (device);wavelength	Hiroshi Tsuda	2011		10.3390/s110706954	electronic engineering;telecommunications;nondestructive testing;engineering;acoustic emission;signal processing;ultrasound;optics	Mobile	92.53305449766144	-20.46233549944372	59550

First, we established estimated lifetimes of halogen lamps regarding short-term use, taking accelerator use into consideration. Through failure analysis, we discovered that the main cause of failure in open halogen lamps were the single wire filaments. We estimated lifetimes, factoring in acceleration in both continuous running and on and off conditions to examine life shortening due to the interruptions. The result of comparing lifetimes of continuously running lamps and on-off lamps found that lamps that were turned off and on had roughly a 31% decrease in life span. This shows that the inrush current generated when turning on a lamp is the main stress shortens the lifetime of lamp. Therefore, automobile manufacturers should provide information about lamp replacement cycles to customers or they should determine lifetimes by conducting additional on-off tests rather than simple continuous tests to find products with longer replacement cycles.	biological specimen;duty cycle;failure analysis;failure cause;integer factorization;interrupt;on-off keying;switch	Youngjin Cho;Jae-Jung Kim	2011	IEEE Transactions on Reliability	10.1109/TR.2011.2135730	life expectancy;electrical resistance and conductance;failure analysis;shape;engineering;electrical engineering;tungsten;halogen;stress;forensic engineering;duty cycle;halogen lamp;inrush current	Metrics	89.0096908290501	-12.32735734061195	59628

This engine converts reciprocating piston motion to rotary output in a novel manner. The engine comprises at least two parallel pistons adapted to reciprocate in cylinders within an engine block closed by upper and lower heads. Each piston is rigidly secured to a piston rod located along the cylinder centerline and extending through substantially fluid tight packing in the lower head. The lower end of each piston rod is flexibly connected to a first connecting means which also includes an opening surrounding a first crank pin. A pair of reciprocating valve means, located within said engine block, are adapted to selectively introduce and exhaust the engine drive fluid into and out of the cylinder above and below the pistons. Valve push rods secured to said valve means are connected to a second connecting means which also has an opening surrounding a second crank pin. Swinging link means are provided interconnecting each of said first and second connecting means and the engine housing to constrain the movement of the piston rods and valve push rods to substantially linear motion. The first and second crank pins are mounted on a crank plate offset from an output drive shaft so that as steam or another fluid drives the pistons, linear motion is converted to rotary output motion. The output drive shaft is supported by a single main bearing which surrounds the output shaft where it passes through the wall of the engine housing. For greater power, a number of these engine units may be ganged.		Simon M. Kaplan;William J. Tolone;Douglas P.

68f6dfce64f2ccbcc63ab4f7fb852e4057840f31	novel approach to non-invasive blood glucose monitoring based on transmittance and refraction of visible laser light		Current blood glucose monitoring (BGM) techniques are invasive as they require a finger prick blood sample, a repetitively painful process that creates the risk of infection. BGM is essential to avoid complications arising due to abnormal blood glucose levels in diabetic patients. Laser light-based sensors have demonstrated a superior potential for BGM. Existing near-infrared (NIR)-based BGM techniques have shortcomings, such as the absorption of light in human tissue, higher signal-to-noise ratio, and lower accuracy, and these disadvantages have prevented NIR techniques from being employed for commercial BGM applications. A simple, compact, and cost-effective non-invasive device using visible red laser light of wavelength 650 nm for BGM (RL-BGM) is implemented in this paper. The RL-BGM monitoring device has three major technical advantages over NIR. Unlike NIR, red laser light has ~30 times better transmittance through human tissue. Furthermore, when compared with NIR, the refractive index of laser light is more sensitive to the variations in glucose level concentration resulting in faster response times ~7–10 s. Red laser light also demonstrates both higher linearity and accuracy for BGM. The designed RL-BGM device has been tested for both in vitro and in vivo cases and several experimental results have been generated to ensure the accuracy and precision of the proposed BGM sensor.	bayesian network;rl circuit;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;video-in video-out	Haider Ali;Faycal Bensaali;Fadi Jaber	2017	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2707384	biomedical engineering;refraction;computer science;refractive index;photonics;accuracy and precision;distributed computing;blood glucose monitoring;laser;wavelength;transmittance	Mobile	94.50572499173217	-21.222363227633892	59798

For this aim, an experimental device was developed to apply the load in two perpendicular directions. Three preload cases, representative of actual structures were selected, biaxially tension, compression and, tensioncompression (shear) loading cases. The samples were produced from unidirectional reinforced E-glass and epoxy, by using a hand lay-up technique. Laminated E-glass/epoxy with stacking sequence [0/90]2s, dimensions were 140 × 140 mm and a thickness of 2 mm for the samples used. Finite element analysis (FEA) was developed, using Hashin failure criteria for the composite material, and material models implemented by a User Material Subroutine into ABAQUS/explicit software, in order to simulate the failure mechanisms and force–time histories. Force–time and energy–time data were obtained by means of user material subroutine from the finite element model. The finite element results showed a good correlation to the experimental data in terms of force–time, energy–time graph or failure in composite plate, although these numerical results strongly depended on simulation parameters like mesh size or the	failure cause;finite element method;glass databases;numerical analysis;preload (software);simulation;stacking;subroutine;thickness (graph theory);velocity (software development)	Ali Kursun;Mehmet Senel;Halil M.

In this work, we immobilized (His)₆-rHbI over a surface modified with gold nanoparticles functionalized with 3-mercaptopropionic acid complexed with nickel ion. The attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) analysis of the modified-gold electrode displays amide I and amide II bands characteristic of a primarily α-helix structure verifying the presence of (His)₆-rHbI on the electrode surface. Also, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results show a new peak after protein interaction corresponding to nitrogen and a calculated overlayer thickness of 5.3 nm. The functionality of the immobilized hemoprotein was established by direct current potential amperometry, using H₂S as the analyte, validating its activity after immobilization. The current response to H₂S concentrations was monitored over time giving a linear relationship from 30 to 700 nM with a corresponding sensitivity of 3.22 × 10-3 nA/nM. These results confirm that the analyzed gold nanostructured platform provides an efficient and strong link for polyhistidine-tag protein immobilization over gold and glassy carbon surfaces for a future biosensors development.

Here, the projected CAP/SAC-CI method is combined with this potential and used to calculate the double-bond and heteroaromatic π* resonances of acetaldehyde, butadiene, glyoxal, pyridine, pyrazine, and furan. As observed in the pilot applications, the corrected η-trajectories provide a stable resonance energy and width or lifetime regardless of the size parameter (rcut ) of the smooth Voronoi potential. However, in general, the stabilization behavior of the trajectories is clearer for larger rcut values, which implies that the interaction of the CAP with the valence electrons is more advantageously addressed by a larger """"cavity"""" size."""

The aim of this note is to derive p-adic dynamics described by fractional differential operators (Vladimirov operators) starting with discrete dynamics based on hierarchically-structured interactions between the fluids’ volumes concentrated at different levels of the percolation tree and coming to the multiscale universal topology of the percolating nets. Similar systems of discrete hierarchic equations were widely applied to modeling of turbulence. However, in the present work this similarity is only formal since, in our model, the trees are real physical patterns with a tree-like topology of capillaries (or fractures) in random porous media (not cascade trees, as in the case of turbulence, which we will be discussed elsewhere for the spinner flowmeter commonly used in the petroleum industry). By going to the “continuous limit” (with respect to the p-adic topology) we represent the dynamics on the tree-like configuration space as an evolutionary nonlinear p-adic fractional (pseudo-) differential equation, the tree-like analog of the Navier–Stokes equation. We hope that our work helps to come closer to a nonlinear equation solution, taking into account the scaling, hierarchies, and formal derivations, imprinted from the similar properties of the real physical world. Once this coupling is resolved, the more problematic question of information scaling in industrial applications will be achieved.	blade runner;dynamical system;image scaling;interaction;navier–stokes equations;nonlinear system;percolation theory;software propagation;turbulence	Klaudia Oleschko;Andrei Khrennikov;María de Jesús Correa López	2017	Entropy	10.3390/e19040161	combinatorics;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;p-adic number;mathematics;quantum mechanics;fluid dynamics	ML	85.52978986167776	1.5983710361851842	60144

The goal is hereby to exploit the advantages offered by nanoscale functional structures on the MEMS device. Besides the obvious miniaturization, further effects can be exploited, e.g. superior material properties of carbon nanotubes (CNT). Generally, two integration techniques can be distinguished: At first, the limits of conventional MEMS batch processing are pushed towards the nanoscale, e.g. through improved masks. Secondly, serial processing techniques based on nanoscale assembly and charged particle beam-based structuring allow to integrate nanoscale functional features and to customize MEMS devices. In this paper the major challenges and solutions for the latter approach will be discussed and illustrated by an example.	gnu nano;microelectromechanical systems;robot	Thomas Wich;Manuel Mikczinski;Sergej Fatikow	2010			materials science;ceramic materials;nanotechnology	Robotics	88.39872389734802	-17.566674788656176	60240

The found rate constants, corresponding to the stepping phenomenon, are close to the rate constants known for the F1-ATPase. The duration of dwells during the product release is shown to depend on the ATP concentration in accordance with the known experimental data."""	adenosine triphosphate;automated theorem proving;f1-atpase activity;interaction;kinetics (discipline);kinetics internet protocol;nyquist rate;rotary woofer;stepping level	B.

Our system diagnoses HIV by detecting the P24 antigen concentration in blood sample. We labeled P24 antigens with chemiluminescence signal, which can be detected by our CMOS photon detector. We designed the single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) with single molecule sensitivity, which can help to diagnosis HIV patient earlier, thus increases the chance of cure and reduce the change of further infection spread. To make the system reusable, we use the 10 um diameter magnetic beads as the assay substrate, which can be coated with the anti-P24 antibodies. These magnetic beads can be delivered through microfluidic channels to the sensing area. Then they can catch p24 antigens from the blood sample and generate chemiluminescence signal. After the test, the magnetic beads can be easily washed away, and the system can be reused.	cmos;diode;sensor;unified model	Bowei Zhang;Zhenyu Li;Qiuchen Yuan;Chia-pin Chang;Mona E.

In a quantum-mechanical theory of gravitation the geometry of space and time is subject to strong fluctuations at extremely short distances. Traditional methods, based on perturbation theory, have difficulties in dealing with these highly nonlinear fluctuations. Discretized models for quantum gravity introduce a fine space-time mesh, and attempt to solve the fundamental equations using large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. We discuss some preliminary results obtained by applying these methods to a model for pure quantum gravity involving up to 983,040 edges in a four-dimensional lattice. A numerical solution to these equations could provide an answer to some basic cosmological questions.

The study utilizes a terahertz time domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) method to measure electrical properties of flexible polyethylene terephthalate/indium tin oxide samples up to 20,000 bending times. In addition, this study utilizes THz-TDS method to measure electrical characteristics of flexible substrates with hard-coat films. Accordingly, the percentage errors of measured sheet resistances based on THz-TDS method are less than or equal to 5.5% for comparison with a contact type four-point probe method or our previously reported flexible characteristic inspection system method. The values show a reasonable agreement with contactmode sheet resistance measurements. Therefore, the electrical properties of thin films are measured offline or online easily by using this method. 2016 Elsevier B.V.

As a result a wavy structure, resembling experimentally observed 'ripple phase', was obtained. The discussion on significance of interactions between dipoles that constitute polar part of the model membrane is presented. Assumptions of the model are closer to the real conditions and reflect the real phenomena much better. Dependence of the model system behaviour on dielectric permeability, ionic strength, and temperature was studied. An influence of reduced number of freedom degrees in the dipole system on the membrane properties was also considered. It was proved that if dielectric permeability of membrane polar part is significantly smaller than water dielectric permeability then the membrane model does not have to take into account changeability of dipole tilt towards membrane surface. This assumption becomes more significant for dielectric permeability epsilon approaching epsilon = 80. Packing degree of hydrocarbon chains in hydrophobic part of the membrane is also responsible for the angle value between dipoles and the membrane surface. The model results are compared to experimental results obtained by means of fluorescence probe fluorescein-PE.	computer simulation;eighty;experiment;fluorescein;fluorescence;greater than;hydrocarbons;interaction;ionic strength;lipid bilayers;phenylephrine hydrochloride 10 mg oral tablet;population parameter;ripple effect;set packing;small;tissue membrane;windows preinstallation environment;fluorescein sodium	Krystian Kubica	2002	Computers & chemistry	10.1016/S0097-8485(01)00127-9	computer simulation;crystallography;chromatography;biochemistry;lipid bilayer;chemistry;computer science;analytical chemistry;lipid bilayer phase behavior;mathematics;ionic strength;statistics;monte carlo method	Robotics	95.7091418005508	-6.315696864029848	60782

For the DC mode, and for measurements with suitable experimental parameters, a linear concentration from 10 to 1600 ng·mL-1 was found. The limits of quantification for l-selenomethionine and Se-methylseleno-l-cysteine were below 10 ng·mL-1. The method can be applied to the quantitative determination of l-selenomethionine and Se-methylseleno-l-cysteine in commercial selenium-containing supplement products.

cf7783b8994eb5f8e3d822475edcd7891ed047c3	reversible peptide folding: dependence on molecular force field used	force field	Temperature-dependent nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and CD spectra of methanol solutions of a β-heptapeptide have been interpreted in such a way that the secondary structure, a 314-helix, is assumed to be stable in a temperature range of between 298 and 393 K. This is in contrast to the results of a 50-ns molecular dynamics simulation using the GROMOS96 force field, which found a melting temperature of about 340 K. This discrepancy is addressed by further computational studies using the OPLS-AA force field. The conformational energetics of N-formyl-3-aminobutanamide in vacuo are obtained using ab initio and density functional quantum-mechanical calculations at the HF/6-31G*, B3LYP/6-31G*, and B3LYP/6-311+G* levels of theory. The results permit development of torsional parameters for the OPLS-AA force field that reproduce the conformational energetics of the monomer. By varying the development procedure, three parameter sets are obtained that focus on reproducing either low-energy or high-energy conformations. These parameter sets are tested by simulating the reversible folding of the β-heptapeptide in methanol. The melting temperature of the helix formed (u003e360 K) is found to be higher than the one obtained from simulations using the GROMOS96 force field (∼340 K). Differences in the potential energy functions of the latter two force fields are evaluated and point to the origins of the difference in stability. © 2000 John Wiley u0026 Sons, Inc.

b032a86af2c8035bb6288e941da772a43146c3d4	computing resonant modes of accelerator cavities by solving nonlinear eigenvalue problems via rational approximation		Author(s): Van Beeumen, R; Marques, O; Ng, EG; Yang, C; Bai, Z; Ge, L; Kononenko, O; Li, Z; Ng, CK; Xiao, L | Abstract: © 2018 We present an efficient and reliable algorithm for solving a class of nonlinear eigenvalue problems arising from the modeling of particle accelerator cavities. The eigenvalue nonlinearity in these problems results from the use of waveguides to couple external power sources or to allow certain excited electromagnetic modes to exit the cavity. We use a rational approximation to reduce the nonlinear eigenvalue problem first to a rational eigenvalue problem. We then apply a special linearization procedure to turn the rational eigenvalue problem into a larger linear eigenvalue problem with the same eigenvalues, which can be solved by existing iterative methods. By using a compact scheme to represent both the linearized operator and the eigenvectors to be computed, we obtain a numerical method that only involves solving linear systems of equations of the same dimension as the original nonlinear eigenvalue problem. We refer to this method as a compact rational Krylov (CORK) method. We implemented the CORK method in the Omega3P module of the Advanced Computational Electromagnetic 3D Parallel (ACE3P) simulation suite and validated it by comparing the computed cavity resonant frequencies and damping Q factors of a small model problem to those obtained from a fitting procedure that uses frequency responses computed by another ACE3P module called S3P. We also used the CORK method to compute trapped modes damped in an ideal eight 9-cell SRF cavity cryomodule. This was the first time it was possible to compute these modes directly. The damping Q factors of the computed modes match well with those measured in experiments and the difference in resonant frequencies is within the range introduced by cavity imperfection. Therefore, the CORK method is an extremely valuable tool for computational cavity design.	cork encoding;eigenvalue algorithm;energy citations database;fixed point (mathematics);fixed-point iteration;iterative method;nonlinear system;particle filter;simple rational approximation;simulation	Roel Van Beeumen;Osni Marques;Esmond G.

The traveling transmembrane potential is produced by the transfer of ionic species between the intra- and extra-cellular mediums. This current flux across the membrane-composed of conduction, diffusion and capacitive terms- is regulated by passive and active mechanisms that are highly complicated to describe mathematically from a microscopic point of view.

The simulative pressure response, the sensitivity, and the linearity of the designed CPS show that the sensor withmicropyramids has the best performance in all the designed models.The corresponding theoretically predicted sensitivity is as high as 6.3 × 10 fF/Pa, which is about 49 times higher than that without any microstructure. Additionally, these further simulative results show that the smaller the ratios of L/H of pyramid, the better the sensitivity but the worse the linearity.When the ratio of L/H of pyramid is about √2, the sensitivity and the linearity could reach a balance point.The simulative results evidently provide the important theoretically directive significance for the further development of e-skin.	cuboid;directive (programming);electronic skin;finite element method;flat panel display;multiphysics;nonlinear system;pyramid (geometry);sensor;simulation	Weili Deng;Xinjie Huang;Wenjun Chu;Yueqi Chen;Lin Mao;Qi Tang;Weiqing Yang	2016	J.

Among the large number of commercial flowmeters, only few kinds of sensors are used in these fields. Among them, variable orifice meters (VOMs) show some valuable characteristics, such as linearity, good dynamic response, and low cost. This paper presents the characterization of a commercial VOM intended for application in respiratory monitoring. Firstly, two nominally identical VOMs were calibrated within &#xb1;10&#x2009;L&#xB7;min&#x2212;1, to assess their metrological properties. Furthermore, experiments were performed by humidifying the air, to evaluate the influence of vapor condensation on sensor&#x2019;s performances. The condensation influence was investigated during two long lasting trials (i.e., 4 hours) by delivering 4&#x2009;L&#xB7;min&#x2212;1 and 8&#x2009;L&#xB7;min&#x2212;1. Data show that the two VOMs&#x2019; responses are linear and their response is comparable (sensitivity difference of 1.4&#x25;, RMSE of 1.50&#x2009;Pa); their discrimination threshold is &#x3c;0.5&#x2009;L&#xB7;min&#x2212;1, and the settling time is about 66&#x2009;ms. The condensation within the VOM causes a negligible change in sensor sensitivity and a very slight deterioration of precision. The good static and dynamic properties and the low influence of condensation on sensor&#x2019;s response make this VOM suitable for applications in respiratory function monitoring.

0bf0cebe13b0eea82142d3c31e221a5637e6f3a9	a computer aided design for an air washer and a dehumidifier tested against two graphical solutions for their applications		A MATLAB code is developed to simulate design criteria used for designing an air washer that operates as a humidifier for air, as well as a dehumidifier. These results, which are based on two practical design examples for the air washer and dehumidifier, are based on previously solved examples using a manual graphical approach as presented in the literature. In the first example, a case of a parallel-flow air washer is used to heat and humidify the outgoing air. In the second example, a counter-flow spray dehumidifier of the air is accomplished where the air is cooled and dehumidified from its initial conditions. The error of the results obtained by this code compared with the manually obtained graphical data is less than 0.24 % and shows the potential use of this computer-based approach for educational purposes so that students can change different parameters and see the outcome of their design criteria on the performance of the air washer and the dehumidifier. With an increase in the number of numerical steps needed to reach the desired design it is shown that the accuracy will increase accordingly.	computer-aided design;graphical user interface;initial condition;matlab;numerical analysis;simulation	Armin Saraei;Samir Moujaes	2017	2017 25th International Conference on Systems Engineering (ICSEng)	10.1109/ICSEng.2017.11	heat transfer;humidity;control engineering;control theory;computer science;computer aided design;washer	EDA	88.3952118901644	-3.375056261494455	61558
6e4eb47da1796d9be2e08aba1a7853a83ba5f83f	the forecast of predictability and instability in physical modelling		the last century, the numerical approach to solving physical problems has gained in relevance with the increase of computational facilities. Methods derived from chaos theory and nonlinear dynamics techniques are quite useful in solving real problems where chaos is present and a strong dependence on initial conditions is a key issue. Predictability refers to the assessment of the likely errors in a forecast, either qualitatively or quantitatively. It refers directly to the stability/instability of the true orbit, but also to the coincidence of the calculated orbit itself, or reliability. Instability is a very well-known factor when considering a given solution to the model. In a broad sense, an orbit is unstable if it is strongly dependent on initial conditions. More precisely, an orbit is chaotic if the dynamics is bounded, has at least one positive Lyapunov exponent and the omega set is not periodic and does not consist solely of equilibrium points and connecting arcs. The larger the instability, the larger is the likehood that the real orbit will diverge from the calculated one. Typically, the reliability time goes with the inverse of the Lyapunov exponent, or Lyapunov time. As all numerical calculations have inherent inaccuracies, beyond certain timescales even the best method will diverge from the true orbit. The usual steps for analysing a given system involve calculating the instability for a given set of initial conditions. It happens that the standard definition of the Lyapunov exponent has a very long convergence time (if any). Due to the slow convergence of the asymptotic value, many others numerical indexes are used, but the basic idea remains the same. However, we can also refer to the numerical reliability of the system understood as the confidence of the computed orbit and the true orbit during an interval of time, independently of its instability. Essentially, computers move from one true orbit to another nearby orbit because of rounding errors and internal floating number representations. However, the computed orbit (called pseudo-orbit) may still lead to correct predictions because of the existence of a nearby exact solution. Otherwise, the calculated orbit may be very distant. The true orbit is called a shadow, and the existence of shadow orbits is a very strong property, with the shadowing time being a valid limit for the predictability of the system. A basic requirement for shadowing is that the system be hyperbolic. In case of nonhy-perbolicity, the point may …	chaitin's constant;chaos theory;computer;control theory;initial condition;instability;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method;numerical weather prediction;relevance;round-off error;rounding;standard-definition television	Juan C.

We combine the RapidCell model for the intracellular chemotaxis signaling pathway to obtain run and tumble behaviors of cells with the method of regularized Stokeslets to simulate cell motility in Stokes flow and the finite element method to solve the advection-diffusion-reaction equation of nutrients. Simulations were carried out using varying numbers of bacterial cells to ascertain the effects of cell-cell and cell-fluid interactions in isotropic environments and in fluids characterized by chemoeffector nutrient gradients. The resulting feedback between hydrodynamics and chemotaxis not only shows expected run and tumble behaviors of bacterial cells but also depicts the importance of fluid dynamical effects on the transport and consumption of chemoeffectors.	cell signaling;gene regulatory network;gradient	Feifei Xu;Robert Bierman;Frank Healy;Hoa Phuoc Trung Nguyen	2016	Computers & Mathematics with Applications	10.1016/j.camwa.2015.12.019	thermodynamics;fluid dynamics	ML	92.9096311682496	-0.8545110844618251	61728

The aim of this work was to compare three electro-chemical instruments [a standard potentiostat (Autolab), a commercially available miniaturized potentiostat (PalmSens) and a homemade micropotentiostat] for easy-to-use and sensitive determination of cadmium(II) and lead(II) ions. The lowest detection limits (hundreds of pM) for both metals was achieved by using of the standard potentiostat, followed by the miniaturized potentiostat (tens of nM) and the homemade instrument (hundreds of nM). Nevertheless, all potentiostats were sensitive enough to evaluate contamination of the environment, because the environmental limits for both metals are higher than detection limits of the instruments. Further, we tested all used potentiostats and working electrodes on analysis of environmental samples (rainwater, flour and plant extract) with artificially added cadmium(II) and lead(II). Based on the similar results obtained for all potentiostats we choose a homemade instrument with a carbon tip working electrode for our subsequent environmental experiments, in which we analyzed maize and sunflower seedlings and rainwater obtained from various sites in the Czech Republic.	biosensors;body tissue;carbon-carbon lyases;experiment;forty nine;gyrate atrophy;instrument - device;instrumentation (attribute);ions;liquid substance;metals;plant extracts;plants;potentiostat;seedlings;transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation;water;electrode;sensor (device)	Olga Krystofova;Libuse Trnkova;Vojtech Adam;Josef Zehnalek;Jaromír Hubálek;Petr Babula;René Kizek	2010		10.3390/s100605308	carbon;water;chemical composition;lead;precipitation;chemistry;plant;microelectrode;sensor;electrochemistry;analytical chemistry;environmental chemistry;amperometry;automation;organic chemistry;miniaturization;environmental monitoring;cadmium;trace element;ion	ML	95.56322860189782	-18.613784402112667	61764
241b589249bad33b17146200048d6efe25a0cb61	controlling electrospinning jet using microscopic model for ideal tissue engineering scaffolds		Electrospinning has recently emerged as a widespread technology to produce synthetic nanofibrous and the best candidates for many important applications like scaffolds in tissue engineering. Creating porosity is the primary challenge of tissue engineering scaffolds. But, the most important challenge is to create uniform nanofibers. For these reasons, controlling producing of electrospun nanofiber becomes important. The most suitable method for controlling instability is using modeling and computer simulations. The dynamic analysis of the jet formation and its instability is difficult during the process. In this study, the behavior of the electrospinning process has been investigated by using bead-spring model to see the process in detail. Simulation of this model showed the jet behavior from the first second to the end by bringing in one bead step by step. Therefore, by increasing the number of beads, the behavior of jet during whipping part was obviously expressed.

While the conventional model to describe FET was extracted from the planar structure with all electrodes laid in the same side. Therefore the effect of the opposite side electrode OFET structure was investigated by using two-dimensional numerical simulation and then comparing to the current-voltage characteristic of fabricated top-contact bottom-gate OFET structures based on pentacene. For this type of structure, a layer of organic semiconductor with a few hundred nanometers thick was employed as active layer and the thickness of this layer has an influence on the saturated current characteristic. The ratio between the saturated drain current and the organic layer thickness becomes approximately constant in some range of the film thickness. In addition the effect of various channel lengths (defined by the distance between edge of source and drain electrodes instead of the heavy doped regions) was examined and the linear dependence part was determined. The effect of insulator thickness dependence can also be demonstrated by modification of electric field from the gate voltage. This model was applied to fabricate the device and verify the effect of electric field from the opposite side of gate electrode.	and gate;computer simulation;current–voltage characteristic;doping (semiconductor);numerical analysis;semiconductor;thickness (graph theory);thin-film transistor;topological insulator	Rawat Jaisutti;Wittawat Yamwong;Sirapat Pratontep;Tanakorn Osotchan	2009	2009 4th IEEE International Conference on Nano/Micro Engineered and Molecular Systems	10.1109/NEMS.2009.5068666	computer simulation;materials science;insulator;field-effect transistor;logic gate;organic field-effect transistor;electrode;electric field;optoelectronics;physics;transistor;organic semiconductor	Robotics	91.40001954960331	-12.883592847340354	61903
1f4a01daaa82347f28cd02bf3bfa3e1ff1d2a164	towards the calculation of casimir forces for inhomogeneous planar media		Casimir forces arise from vacuum fluctuations. They are fully understood only for simple models, and are important in nanoand microtechnologies. We report our experience of computer algebra calculations towards the Casimir force for models involving inhomogeneous dielectrics. We describe a methodology that greatly increases confidence in any results obtained, and use this methodology to demonstrate that the analytic derivation of scalar Green’s functions is at the boundatry of current computer algebra technology. We further demonstrate that Lifshitz theory of electromagnetic vacuum energy can not be directly applied to calculate the Casimir stress for models of this type, and produce results that indicate the possibility of alternative regularisations. We discuss the relative strengths and weaknesses of computer algebra systems when applied to this type of problem, and suggest combined numerical and symbolic approaches towards a more general computational framework.	computer algebra system;numerical analysis;quantum fluctuation;symbolic computation;symbolic-numeric computation	Caihua Xiong;Thomas W.

In this climatological context, a major limitation of MEP is that it is generally assumed to be applicable only for stationary systems. It is therefore often anticipated that critical climatic features like the seasonal cycle or climatic change cannot be represented within this framework. We discuss here several possibilities in order to introduce timevarying climatic problems using the MEP formalism. We will show that it is possible to formulate a MEP model which accounts for time evolution in a consistent way. This formulation leads to physically relevant results as long as the internal time scales associated with thermal inertia are small compared to the speed of external changes. We will focus on transient changes as well as on the seasonal cycle in a conceptual climate box-model in order to discuss the physical relevance of such an extension of the MEP framework.	climate model;gradient;köppen climate classification;linear programming relaxation;media-embedded processor;osi model;relevance;resource description framework;semantics (computer science);stationary process;thermal time hypothesis	Didier Paillard;Corentin Herbert	2013	Entropy	10.3390/e15072846	meteorology;econometrics;principle of maximum entropy;mathematics;thermodynamics;physics;statistics;climate model	AI	90.65881653891513	1.2679225241332372	62027

In this study, four tooth extrusion processes with various extrusion ratios and preform shape were developed, and they were simulated using AFDEX software for examining how the clutch drum influenced tooth forming. Various tooth-filling results were obtained by controlling the extrusion ratio and die cavity in each process. A comparison of the deformation, material flow, and mean stress state among the processes revealed that the stress state was the main determinant of the local flowing material, and it was used to improve the degree of tooth filling. The optimal tooth-filling result was obtained using a two-step extrusion process with an appropriate extrusion ratio and a preform shape.

Initially, three types of these screen-printed OECTs with a different channel and gate areas ratio were compared in terms of output characteristics, transfer characteristics, and current modulation in a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution. Results confirm that transistors with a gate electrode larger than the channel exhibit higher modulation. OECTs with this geometry were therefore chosen to investigate their ion-sensitive properties in aqueous solutions of cations of different sizes (sodium and rhodamine B). The effect of the gate electrode was additionally studied by comparing these all-PEDOT:PSS transistors with OECTs with the same geometry but with a non-polarizable metal gate (Ag). The operation of the all-PEDOT:PSS OECTs yields a response that is not dependent on a Na⁺ or rhodamine concentration. The weak modulation of these transistors can be explained assuming that PEDOT:PSS behaves like a supercapacitor. In contrast, the operation of Ag-Gate OECTs yields a response that is dependent on ion concentration due to the redox reaction taking place at the gate electrode with Cl- counter-ions. This indicates that, for cation detection, the response is maximized in OECTs with non-polarizable gate electrodes.	and gate;buffers;cations;chloride ion;doping (semiconductor);ionic;ions;iontophoresis;large;metal gate;modulation;organic synthesis techniques;pedot:pss;perceived stress scale;physical symbol system;printing;rhodamine b;salineos;scientific publication;silver;sodium;solutions;systemic scleroderma;transistor;transistors;unithiol;electrode;inorganic phosphate	Laura Contat-Rodrigo;Clara Pérez-Fuster;José Vicente Lidón-Roger;Annalisa Bonfiglio;Eduardo García-Breijo	2016		10.3390/s16101599	electronic engineering;chemistry;pedot:pss;analytical chemistry;nanotechnology;physical chemistry	EDA	93.26346808524865	-14.719164072487875	62092

The focus of the work is on the simulation of the roll deformation and its relationship with the hydrodynamics in the nip. The free surface movement of the fluid domain is included in the model, and is coupled to the deformation of the elastomer-covered roll for the case of a negative gap. An iterative approach is used, whereby the free surface movement is adjusted according to the normal velocity component along the boundary. The governing equations are solved with the finite element method and adaptive re-meshing of the domain between iterations. The elastomer deformation is modeled using a two-dimensional approach, where the elastomer/liquid interface is updated using the force balance at the surface. The solid and fluid problems are solved in a de-coupled manner, in which each problem is solved separately and alternately until final overall convergence is obtained. A comparison with recently obtained data shows a close match between experiment and simulation. Finally, the methodology is applied to investigate the effect on the pressure profile of the properties of non-Newtonian Kaolin-latex coating formulations and roll speeds typical of those in the industry. The results show that the proposed model can help gain insight into the mechanisms that govern this type of coating process.	pipe rolls	Hervé Lécuyer;J. P. Mmbaga;R. E.

The pH sensitive polymeric film, poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) was deposited on the circumference of the TFBG with the layer-by-layer (LbL) electrostatic self-assembly technique. The PDDA/PAA film exhibits a reduction in refractive index by swelling in different pH solutions. This effect results in wavelength shifts and transmission changes in the spectrum of the TFBG. The peak amplitude of the dominant spectral fringes over a certain window of the transmission spectrum, obtained by FFT analysis, has a near-linear pH sensitivity of 117 arbitrary unit (a.u.)/pH unit and an accuracy of ±1 a.u. (in the range of pH 4.66 to pH 6.02). The thickness and surface morphology of the sensing multilayer film were characterized to investigate their effects on the sensor's performance. The dynamic response of the sensor also has been studied (10 s rise time and 18 s fall time for a sensor with six bilayers of PDDA/PAA).	amplifier;arbitrary unit;atomic-force microscopy;benzalkonium chloride 1.3 mg/ml medicated pad;chloride ion;coating excipient;copper(ii) chloride;diameter (qualifier value);edema;exhibits as topic;eye;fall time;fast fourier transform;genus paa;hydrogels;mathematical morphology;mathematical optimization;micron;optical fiber;optics;passive optical network;polyelectrolytes;polymer;psyllium 14.2 mg/ml oral suspension;rs-232;rise time;self-assembly;sensor;solutions;thickness (graph theory);thioctic acid;tissue fiber;calcium polycarbophil 625 mg oral tablet;wavelength	Liyang Shao;Ming-Jie Yin;Hwa-Yaw Tam;Jacques Albert	2013		10.3390/s130201425	telecommunications;bioinformatics;fiber optic sensor;nanotechnology;optics	Mobile	94.5502341533307	-16.481924473543046	62483

However, these methods may fail to track some desired solution curves due to the interference of the rotational equivalent solutions on a radially symmetric domain.

Taking this parameterization and its variational nature, an algorithm is proposed that permits to locate this type of curve joining two points from an arbitrary curve that joints the same initial and final points. The initial and final points are minima of the potential energy surface associated with the geometry of reactants and products of the reaction whose mechanism is under study. The arbitrary curves are moved toward the IRC curve by a Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg technique. This technique integrates a set of differential equations resulting from the minimization until value zero of the line integral over the Weierstrass E-function. The Weierstrass E-function is related with the second variation in the theory of calculus of variations. The algorithm has been proved in real chemical systems.

To exploit the replica framework optimally, the level of the biasing potential in each replica was appropriately adapted during the simulations. This resulted in both high exchange rates between neighboring replicas and improved occupancy/flow of all conformers in each replica. The performance of the approach was tested on several peptide and protein systems and compared with regular MD simulations and previous REMD studies. Improved sampling of relevant conformational states was observed for unrestrained protein and peptide folding simulations as well as for refinement of a loop structure with restricted mobility of loop flanking protein regions.	biasing;flank (surface region);hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);internet backbone;molecular dynamics;norm (social);parallel tempering;refinement (computing);sampling (signal processing);simulation;vertebral column	Katja Ostermeir;Martin Zacharias	2014	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.23476	crystallography;chemistry;computational chemistry;nuclear magnetic resonance	Comp.	98.89387775002912	-2.7495104894191407	62773

These wax components are later used as pattern in investment casting process. Due to low thermal conductivity of polyurethane, cooling time in ST process is long. To reduce the cooling time, thermal conductive fillers are incorporated into polyurethane to make composite mould material. However, addition of fillers affects various properties of the ST process, such as stiffness of the mould box, rendering flow-ability of melt mould material, etc. In the present work, multi-objective optimization of various conflicting objectives (namely maximization of equivalent thermal conductivity, minimization of effective modulus of elasticity, and minimization of equivalent viscosity) of composite material are conducted using evolutionary algorithms (EAs) in order to design particle-reinforced polyurethane composites by finding the optimal values of design parameters. The design parameters include volume fraction of filler content, size and shape factor of filler particle, etc. The Pareto-optimal front is targeted by solving the corresponding multi-objective problem using the NSGA-II procedure. Then, suitable multi-criterion decision-making techniques are employed to select one or a small set of the optimal solution(s) of design parameter(s) based on the higher level information of the ST process for industrial applications. Finally, the experimental study with a typical real industrial application demonstrates that the obtained optimal design parameters significantly reduce the cooling time in soft tooling process keeping other processing advantages.	computer cooling;elasticity (data store);entropy maximization;evolutionary algorithm;experiment;mathematical optimization;modulus of continuity;modulus robot;multi-objective optimization;optimal design;pareto efficiency;shape factor (image analysis and microscopy);star filler	Arup Kumar Nandi;Shubhabrata Datta;Kalyanmoy Deb	2012	Soft Comput.	10.1007/s00500-011-0797-x	computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;evolutionary algorithm	EDA	87.66245767497216	-17.86310339173782	62817

On transistor level the miniaturization reaches its limits and more ICs will be required. More in and out contacts of the ICs have to be realized and the increasing contact density leads to rising current densities, due to smaller solder joints. Similar to the reliability problems with interconnects on IC level, the rising current densities lead to migration induced void formation in the solder joints. In consequence migration induced phenomena have a growing influence on the lifetime of the packages. Hence it is necessary to investigate the migration induced material transport in solder joints to enable a prediction of the package lifetime.#R##N##R##N#For the investigation of migration induced void formation in solder joints a finite element model of a common Package on Package structure was built. Thermal–electrical and thermal–mechanical simulations with ANSYS® were carried out. Furthermore the mass flux and mass flux divergences due thermo- and electromigration were calculated with a user routine. For the validation of the simulation results, stress tests with 14 × 14 mm and 12 × 12 mm Amkor® Package on Package structures were made. Oven temperatures of 120 °C and 100 °C and an applied current of 1A were chosen. Agreements between simulation results and measurements were found. The simulation results verify that current crowding is the main reason for void formation in solder joints. Furthermore a sensitivity analysis was made to check the influence of material parameter variations on the simulation results. Based on this, the influence of underfill materials and inhomogeneous temperature fields on the void formation was investigated. Inhomogeneous temperature fields are the results of heat loss in the mounted ICs in consequence Joule heating. A constant heat loss all over the IC surfaces as well as hot spots placed near to the bump chains and in the center of the package was investigated.	failure cause;package on package	Lutz Meinshausen;Kirsten Weide-Zaage;Hélène Frémont	2012	Microelectronics Reliability	10.1016/j.microrel.2012.06.115	electronic engineering;electrical engineering;forensic engineering	Logic	89.67730297063233	-11.686338548467443	62906

In this study, we calculated the gas adsorption of Pt-decorated (8,0) single-wall CNTs (Pt-SWCNTs) with SO2, H2S, and CO using GGA/PW91 method based on density functional theory. The adsorption energies and the changes in geometric and electronic structures after absorption were comprehensively analyzed to estimate the responses of Pt-SWCNTs. Results indicated that Pt-SWCNTs can respond to the three gases. The electrical characteristics of Pt-SWCNTs show different changes after adsorption. Pt-SWCNTs donate electrons and increase the number of hole carriers after adsorbing SO2, thereby enhancing its conductivity. When H2S is adsorbed on CNTs, electrons are transferred from H2S to Pt-SWCNTs, converting Pt-SWCNTs from p-type to n-type sensors with improved conductivity. However, Pt-SWCNTs obtain electrons and show decreased conductivity when reacted with CO gas.	carbon dioxide;density functional theory;electronic structure;electrons;energy, physics;functional theories of grammar;gases;nanotubes;nanotubes, carbon;pt term type;sulfur dioxide;ultima vii part two: serpent isle;sensor (device)	Xiaoxing Zhang;Ziqiang Dai;Li Wei;Naifeng Liang;Xiaoqing Wu	2013		10.3390/s131115159	carbon monoxide;chemistry;adsorption;platinum;organic chemistry;nanotechnology;inorganic chemistry;physical chemistry;density functional theory;optical properties of carbon nanotubes	HCI	92.36857642677704	-13.579863956669353	63294

Here, we present an alternative optical method in bright field mode called Spatially Multiplexed Micro-Spectrophotometry that allows rapid and non-destructive characterization of thin films over areas of mm² and with 1 μm of lateral resolution. We demonstrate an accuracy of 0.1% in the thickness characterization through measurements performed on four microcantilevers that expand an area of 1.8 mm² in one minute of analysis time. The measured thickness variation in the range of few tens of nm translates into a mechanical variability that produces an error of up to 2% in the response of the studied devices when they are used to measure surface stress variations.	calculus of variations;heart rate variability;lateral thinking;multiplexing;nanotechnology;semiconductor industry;thickness (graph theory);thin film;transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation	Valerio Pini;Priscila M.

This topology is based on critical path lines which repeat the same spatial cycle per time period. Around those path lines there are areas of similar asymptotic flow behavior (basins) which are captured by a 2D Poincaré map as a discrete dynamical system. Due to pseudo discontinuities in this map and the discrete integration scheme, separatrices between the basins can’t be obtained as integral curves. Instead we choose a point-wise approach to segment the Poincaré map and apply image analysis algorithms to extract the 2D separation curves. Starting from those curves we integrate separation surfaces which partition the periodic 2D time-dependent vector field into areas of similar path line behavior. We apply our approach to a number of data sets to demonstrate its utility.	algorithm;converge;critical path method;dynamical system;emoticon;force field (chemistry);image analysis;randomness;sampling (signal processing);separation kernel;supersampling	Kuangyu Shi;Holger Theisel;Tino Weinkauf;Helwig Hauser;Hans-Christian Hege;Hans-Peter Seidel	2007	Journal of WSCG		combinatorics;discrete mathematics;computer science;machine learning;mathematics;geometry	Visualization	100.42978190126742	3.298997626852276	63612

The oscillating Langevin antenna is shown to capture the essential features of the larger scale turbulence and efficiently couple to the plasma, generating steadystate turbulence within one characteristic turnaround time.

98bda048e5c461dbd2c81d28515d0c2f71d87f22	compact modeling of dynamic trap density evolution for predicting circuit-performance aging		Abstract It is shown that a compact MOSFET-aging model for circuit simulation is possible by considering the dynamic trap-density increase, which is induced during circuit operation. The dynamic trap/detrap phenomenon, which influences the switching performance, is also considered on the basis of well-known previous results. Stress-dependent hot-carrier effect and NBTI effect, origins of the device aging, are modeled during the circuit simulation for each device by integrating the substrate current as well as by determining the oxide-field change due to the trapped carriers over the individual stress-duration periods. A self-consistent solution can be obtained only by iteratively solving the Poisson equation including the dynamically changing trap density, which is achieved with negligible simulation time penalty. To enable accurate circuit-aging simulation, even for high-voltage MOSFETs, the carrier traps within the highly resistive drift region are additionally considered.

The goal of this study is to generate micro and uniform droplets in various viscosity liquids by using a micropore plate oscillated by an ultrasonic torsional transducer. When the micropore plate was not oscillated, droplets were generated irregularly. On the other hand, when the micropore plate was oscillated by the ultrasonic torsional transducer, droplets were generated regularly by ruffling liquid surface. We have generated droplets in the air by using pure water and silicone oil of various viscosities and evaluated droplets. We have designed the ultrasonic torsional transducer and a droplet generation device to apply a high pressure for the use of higher viscosity liquids. We have succeeded in generating droplets by using pure water when we used the ultrasonic torsional transducer. The average diameter of droplets was 30.0µm and the standard deviation was 0.98. We have also succeeded in generating 50cSt silicone oil droplets using the droplet generation device. The average diameter of droplets was 98.0µm and the standard deviation was 0.76.	semiconductor;transducer	Yusuke Kiyama;Yoshiyuki Tominaga;Takefumi Kanda;Koichi Suzumori;Yoshiaki Yamada;Norihisa Seno	2011	2011 International Symposium on Micro-NanoMechatronics and Human Science	10.1109/MHS.2011.6102165	materials science;ceramic materials;acoustics;optics	Robotics	88.01626087713767	-16.63015586842995	64227
d0474704f21e3da995733dfbc9cc4e1a83d7a88d	treatment of delocalized electron transfer in periodic and embedded cluster dft calculations: the case of cu on zno (10 1¯0)	band filling;materialkemi;charge transfer;embedded clusters;slabs;materials chemistry;supercells	We assess the consequences of the interface model-embedded-cluster or periodic-slab model-on the ability of DFT calculations to describe charge transfer (CT) in a particularly challenging case where periodic-slab calculations indicate a delocalized charge-transfer state. Our example is Cu atom adsorption on ZnO(10(1)0), and in fact the periodic slab calculations indicate three types of CT depending on the adsorption site: full CT, partial CT, and no CT. Interestingly, when full CT occurs in the periodic calculations, the calculated Cu atom adsorption energy depends on the underlying ZnO substrate supercell size, since when the electron enters the ZnO it delocalizes over as many atoms as possible. In the embedded-cluster calculations, the electron transferred to the ZnO delocalizes over the entire cluster region, and as a result the calculated Cu atom adsorption energy does not agree with the value obtained using a large periodic supercell, but instead to the adsorption energy obtained for a periodic supercell of roughly the same size as the embedded cluster. Different density functionals (of GGA and hybrid types) and basis sets (local atom-centered and plane-waves) were assessed, and we show that embedded clusters can be used to model Cu adsorption on ZnO(10(1)0), as long as care is taken to account for the effects of CT.

Extensive all-atom Monte Carlo simulations were employed to sample the compounds in explicit solvent. While the focus of our study was to demonstrate well-converged and reproducible free energies, we attempted to address the deficiencies in the general Amber force field force field with a simple QM/MM correction. We show that by using multiple independent simulations, including different starting configurations, and enhanced sampling with parallel tempering, we can obtain well converged hydration free energies. Additional analysis using dihedral angle distributions, torsion-root mean square deviation plots and thermodynamic cycles support this assertion.

The extensive reliability characterization study was conducted on 14nm FinFETs to study the effects of anneals using various gas sources (including high/normal pressure D2, H2, and N2). Despite that high pressure D2 (HP D2) anneal gave the best I/O NFET HCI reliability performance, most of the other anneals also provided reasonable and comparable reliability results that can provide as more cost-effective alternate process approach.

The N-phase formulations stem from a phase field model we developed in a recent work based on the conservations of mass/momentum, and the second law of thermodynamics. The introduction of general order parameters leads to an extremely strongly-coupled system of ( N - 1 ) phase field equations. On the other hand, the general form enables one to compute the N-phase mixing energy density coefficients in an explicit fashion in terms of the pairwise surface tensions. We show that the increased complexity in the form of the phase field equations associated with general order parameters in actuality does not cause essential computational difficulties. Our numerical algorithm reformulates the ( N - 1 ) strongly-coupled phase field equations for general order parameters into 2 ( N - 1 ) Helmholtz-type equations that are completely de-coupled from one another. This leads to a computational complexity comparable to that for the simplified phase field equations associated with certain special choice of the order parameters. We demonstrate the capabilities of the method developed herein using several test problems involving multiple fluid phases and large contrasts in densities and viscosities among the multitude of fluids. In particular, by comparing simulation results with the Langmuir-de Gennes theory of floating liquid lenses we show that the method using general order parameters produces physically accurate results for multiple fluid phases.	algorithm;numerical analysis;simulation	Suchuan Dong	2015	J.

This allows for efficient calculation of the electronic structure of clusters (and molecules) with high accuracy and systematic convergence properties without the need for any artificial periodicity. The basis functions in this method form a complete orthonormal set and are expressible in terms of spherical harmonics and spherical Bessel functions. Computation of the occupied eigenstates of the discretized KohnSham Hamiltonian is carried out using a combination of preconditioned block eigensolvers and Chebyshev polynomial filter accelerated subspace iterations. Several algorithmic and computational aspects of the method, including computation of the electrostatics terms and parallelization are discussed. We have implemented these methods and algorithms into an efficient and reliable package called ClusterES (Cluster Electronic Structure). A variety of benchmark calculations employing local and non-local pseudopotentials are carried out using our package and the results are compared to the literature. Convergence properties of the basis set are discussed through numerical examples. Computations involving large systems that contain thousands of electrons are demonstrated to highlight the efficacy of our methodology. The use of our method to study clusters with arbitrary point group symmetries is briefly discussed.		Amartya Banerjee;Ryan S. Elliott;Richard D. James	2015	J. Comput.

Methyl isocyanate and ethylene oxide were adopted as model reactants. The products, 2-oxazolidones and isocyanurates, cannot be yielded without a base catalyst. The 2-oxazolidone may be produced by a dual SN2 reaction, where the catalyst base (e.g., Cl−) is a nucleophile and a leaving group on the ethylene–oxide carbon. Isocyanurate is generated by the stepwise association of three isocyanate molecules, where one of the molecules is initially linked with a base. The six-membered ring isocyanurate is isomerized stepwise into the components isocyanate and 2-oxazolidone. A tetrahedral type of complex between the isocyanurate and a base-catalyzed ethylene oxide is the key intermediate for the isomerization. c © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) sensors provide desirable characteristics for hydrogen detection due to their small size, low fabrication cost, ease of integration and high sensitivity. In this paper a finite element model of a Surface Acoustic Wave sensor is developed using ANSYS12© and tested for hydrogen detection. The sensor consists of a YZ-lithium niobate substrate with interdigital electrodes (IDT) patterned on the surface. A thin palladium (Pd) film is added on the surface of the sensor due to its high affinity for hydrogen. With increased hydrogen absorption the palladium hydride structure undergoes a phase change due to the formation of the β-phase, which deteriorates the crystal structure. Therefore with increasing hydrogen concentration the stiffness and the density are significantly reduced. The values of the modulus of elasticity and the density at different hydrogen concentrations in palladium are utilized in the finite element model to determine the corresponding SAW sensor response. Results indicate that with increasing the hydrogen concentration the wave velocity decreases and the attenuation of the wave is reduced.	acoustic cryptanalysis;acoustic fingerprint;crystal structure;elastic modulus;elasticity (data store);finite element method;handling (psychology);hepatitis b surface antigens;hydrogen;interdigital transducer;interrupt descriptor table;ion-selective electrodes;lithium;medication event monitoring system;microelectromechanical systems;modulus of continuity;processor affinity;reduction (complexity);surface acoustic wave device component;thin-film transistor;velocity (software development);electrode;palladium hydride;phase change;sensor (device)	Mohamed M.

It even can be used as integrated means of exothermic/endothermic reaction and catalytic reaction/catalyst regeneration, opens up new ways to strengthen and control the reaction process, reduce waste emissions, and increase economic and social benefits. Therefore, it has great significance to model, simulate and calculate the process of chemical reaction. In this paper, a cooperative firefly algorithm is proposed to solve the optimal dynamic model of chemical reaction. The characteristics of the proposed algorithm are analyzed in detailed and the simulation results of the algorithm are given. It provides a feasible solution to solve such problems and the simulation results also show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.	firefly algorithm	Yuanbin Mo;Yanyue Lu;Yanzhui Ma	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-93815-8_42	chemical reactor;firefly algorithm;reversible reaction;mathematical optimization;exothermic reaction;chemical reaction;polymerization;catalysis;computer science;reaction rate	Robotics	92.82472448832323	-3.7106226742160864	65434

The CL spectra of the ZnSe exhibited both impurity emission peaks (1.8–2.4 eV band) and near-bandgap emission peaks (2.68 eV). Although CL emissions were generated during four unloading/reloading cycles, the decreased intensity of the impurity emission can be explained in terms of extended dislocation nucleation and propagation during nanoindentation. The resultant dislocation and microcracks were visualized using CL mapping and transmission electron microscopy. We suspect that the formation of a hysteresis loop during the four unloading/reloading cycles was due, in part, to massive dislocation activities induced	basal (phylogenetics);electron;hysteresis;resultant;slip (programming language);software propagation;zaf	Wei-Hung Yau;Pai-Chung Tseng;Hua-Chiang Wen;Chien-Huang Tsai;Wu-Ching Chou	2011	Microelectronics Reliability	10.1016/j.microrel.2011.01.005	crystallography;transmission electron microscopy;zinc;single crystal;physics	HCI	94.901416958969	-12.459756756678308	65507

The LES with the Smagorinsky subgrid-scale (SGS) model was adopted for the turbulence simulation. To improve the credibility of our results on the lattice model effect, a comprehensive sensitivity study was performed of boundary treatment techniques and collision models, as well as grid sizes in the simulation of the turbulent pipe flows. Through the turbulent circular pipe flow simulation, it was discovered that the D3Q27 lattice model could achieve the rotational invariance in terms of long-time-averaged turbulence statistics and generated the results comparable to the DNS data, while the D3Q19 lattice model broke the rotational invariance and produced unreasonable data. In the turbulent square duct flow simulation, the rotational invariance was evaluated by comparing the results before and after rotating the geometry by 45^o about a center. As in the circular pipe flow simulation, the D3Q19 lattice model could not achieve the rotational invariance while the D3Q27 lattice model could. The D3Q19 lattice model also produced poor results compared to those from the D3Q27 lattice model. These defects of the D3Q19 lattice model could be explained by the planes consisting of 2D lattices with five velocities (called defective planes in this study) in the D3Q19 lattice model, based on White and Chong's [14] hypothesis. The defective planes had a deficiency in the momentum transfer of flow and turbulence, thus breaking the rotational invariance and causing the inaccurate results for tested problems.	lattice boltzmann methods;lattice model (physics);simulation;turbulence	Shin K.

The purpose of this paper is to determine the actual induction charging time constant for practical types of particles having both finite conductivity and permittivity. All investigations were based on numerical simulations done for idealized geometric models of the problem. The model was developed for the transient case and solved by using the COMSOL commercial software, which is based on the finite-element method. Spherical and rough particles with various contact areas with the ground electrode were considered. The surface conduction of the particle was neglected. The effect of the particle contact area, conductivity, and permittivity on the actual charging time constant was investigated, and the results were compared with that predicted by the classic relaxation time constant, as defined by the material properties. It was found that the actual time constant is not equal to the relaxation time constant but is directly affected by the value of the contact area between the particle and ground electrode.	commercial software;finite element method;linear programming relaxation;numerical analysis;simulation	Deying Yu;G.

0bb5d4cbf986321e2e00dacc9e7cce0ad986ddb2	experimental and comparative study of gamma radiation effects on si-igbt and sic-jfet		This paper deals with an experimental study and a comparative study of the effects of total ionising dose of 60Co gamma radiation on Si-IGBT and SiC-JFET. The response of the threshold voltage and the turn-on switching parameters are reported for both devices. Charge trapping in the gate oxide causes the decrease of the threshold voltage for Si-IGBT. The decrease of this parameter combined with the behaviour of Miller plateau during irradiation results in a decrease of the collector current rise-time, the collector-emitter voltage fall-time, and the turn-on switching energy and in an increase of the peak of the turn-on switching power and of the turn-on overshoot collector current. No changes in these parameters are observed for SiC-JFETs up to 2900 Gy with a dose rate of 2.80 Gy/h. This indicates that those SiC-JFETs have extremely high radiation resistance with respect to the TID effects compared to the Si-IGBTs.	fall time;insulated-gate bipolar transistor;overshoot (signal);rise time;sic-povm	Boubekeur Tala-Ighil;Jean-Lionel Trolet;Hamid Gualous;P.

The PA concentration in the membrane can affect fuel cell performance, as a significant amount of PA can leak from the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) by dissolution in discharged water, which is a byproduct of cell operation. Spectrophotometric analysis of PA leakage in PA-doped polybenzimidazole membrane fuel cells is described here. This spectrophotometric analysis is based on measurement of absorption of an ion pair formed by phosphomolybdic anions and the cationoid color reagent. Different color reagents were tested based on PA detection sensitivity, stability of the formed color, and accuracy with respect to the amount of PAmeasured.Thismethod allows for nondestructive analysis andmonitoring of PA leakage during HT-PEMFCs operation.	ac (complexity);doping (semiconductor);hyper-threading;pa-risc;polymer;sensor;spectral leakage	Seungyoon Han;Yeon Hun Jeong;Ju Hae Jung;Alina Begley;Euiji Choi;Sung Jong Yoo;Jong Hyun Jang;Hyoung-Juhn Kim;Suk Woo Nam;Jin Young Kim	2016	J.

In this study, TMR devices were first employed to form a circular magnetic flux leakage (MFL) sensor for slight wire rope flaw detection. Two versions of this tailor-made circular TMR-based sensor array were presented for the inspection of wire ropes with the diameters of 14mm and 40mm, respectively. Helmholtz-like coils or a ferrite magnet-based magnetizer was selected to provide the proper magnetic field, in order to meet the technical requirements of the TMR devices. The coefficient of variance in the flaw detection performance of the sensor array elements was experimentally estimated at 4.05%. Both versions of the MFL sensor array were able to detect multiple single-broken wire flaws in the wire ropes. The accurate axial and circumferential positions of these broken wire flaws were estimated from the MFL scanning image results. In addition, the proposed TMR-based sensor array was applied to detect the MFL signal induced by slight surface wear defects. Amutual correlation analysis method was used to distinguish the signals caused by the lift-off fluctuation from the MFL scanning image results. The MFL sensor arrays presented in this study provide inspiration for the designing of tailor-made TMR-based circular sensor arrays for cylindrical ferromagnetic structural inspections.

We describe a novel enhancement mechanism, which originates from the different effect that confining potential has on s-band and d-band electrons. We demonstrate that the interplay between finite-size and screening effects in the nanoparticle surface layer leads to an enhancement of the surface plasmon local field acting on a molecule located in a close proximity to the metal surface. Our calculations, based on time-dependent local density approximation, show that the additional enhancement of the Raman signal is especially strong for small nanometer-sized nanoparticles. q 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In constructing the statistical mechanics of distinguishable particles from the definition of Boltzmann entropy, it is found that the entropy is not extensive. The inextensivity leads to the so-called Gibbs paradox in which the mixing entropy of two identical classical gases increases. Lots of literature from different points of view were created to resolve the paradox. In this paper, starting from the Boltzmann entropy, we present the thermodynamics of the system of distinguishable particles. A straightforward way to get the corrected Boltzmann counting is shown. The corrected Boltzmann counting factor can be justified in classical statistical mechanics.	boltzmann machine;gibbs' inequality;subatomic particle	Chi Ho Cheng	2009	Entropy	10.3390/e11030326	classical mechanics;statistical physics;entropy;statistical mechanics;principle of maximum entropy;gibbs paradox;mathematics;boltzmann's entropy formula;maximum entropy thermodynamics;h-theorem;configuration entropy;maxwell–boltzmann statistics;entropy;thermodynamics;entropy in thermodynamics and information theory;physics;quantum mechanics;entropy;entropy;entropy	ML	92.36763700791049	2.4508578529426237	66467

For the flip-chip devices mounted on the multi-layer substrate, the CTE mismatch between the silicon chip and substrate was reduced, and bending deformation decreased. Of the four flip-chip devices studied, the underfilled flip-chip device mounted on the multi-layer substrate had the least deformed solder balls.	flip chip;tail value at risk	Yasuyuki Morita;Kazuo Arakawa;Mitsugu Todo;Masayuki Kaneto	2006	Microelectronics Reliability	10.1016/j.microrel.2005.02.013	thermal expansion;electronic engineering;engineering drawing;physics	HCI	90.90602756106134	-10.513540332402219	66565

In particular, we examine the influence of the shape of the adsorption energy distribution on the equilibrium isotherms of hydrogen ions. To that purpose, a few popular distribution functions, including rectangular, exponential, and asymmetric Gaussian are considered. Additionally, multimodal distribution functions, which may correspond to the adsorption on different crystal planes of the oxide, are also used. Lateral interactions between adsorbed charges are modeled using the potential function proposed by Borkovec et al., which accounts also for polarization of the liquid medium. The results presented here are obtained using both Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and theoretical calculations involving Mean Field Approximation (MFA). They indicate that increased energetic heterogeneity of the adsorbing surface may, in general, considerably change the behavior of the adsorption isotherms, regardless of the assumed distribution function. It is also shown that the predictions of the proposed theory are consistent with the data obtained from the MC simulations.

We also want to simulate different conditions respect to the parameters involved of several materials for its construction and efficiency. The model is expressed in terms of a coupled nonlinear system of differential equations which are solved using Mathematica 8. The results obtained by our model are compared with measurements of solar cooker in field testing operation. We obtained good results in agreement with experimental data. Moreover, the simulation results are used by calculating cooking power and standardized cooking power of solar cooker for different parameters.	mathematical model;nonlinear system;simulation;wolfram mathematica	Mauricio González Avilés;José Juan González Avilés	2013	CoRR		thermodynamics	HPC	88.80400978808747	-3.1564943664922733	66874

Laser power, welding speed and defocusing distance combinations were carefully selected with the objective of producing welded joint with complete penetration, minimum fusion zone size and acceptable welding profile. Fusion zone area of dissimilar austenitic stainless steel with ferritic low carbon steel was evaluated as a function of the selected laser welding parameters. Taguchi approach was used as statistical Design of Experiment (DOE) technique for optimising the selected welding parameters in terms of minimising the fusion zone. A mathematical model was developed to describe the influence of the selected parameters on the fusion zone area and to predict its value within the limits of the variables being studied. The result indicates that the developed model can predict the welded bead area satisfactorily.	taguchi methods	E. M. Anawa;A. G. Olabi;M. S. J.

The velocity and frequency of acoustic waves change when the mass is on the sensing area. The mass on the electrodes causes the mass-loading effects and decreases the center frequency. The sensitivity curve can be obtained due to the center frequency shift. In this work, the Potassium Chloride (KCL) is used to deposit on the sensing area. Different concentrations of KCL solution lead to different masses and center frequencies on the surface. According to the simulation results, it shows the linearity between the center frequency shift and the thickness of the deposited KCL layer.	acoustic cryptanalysis;input/output;interdigital transducer;interrupt descriptor table;kirchhoff's circuit laws;simulation;synchronization (computer science);thickness (graph theory);velocity (software development);voltage divider	Hsu-Cheng Ou;Mona E.

e7d28a3445f15bdcb37fedefea464c4bcc3a9daa	geodynamic mantle modeling and its relation to origin and preservation of life		Section 1 refers to hypotheses on the origin of life. These different hypotheses require distinct geodynamic and structural-geology prerequisites. For example, in case of chemoautotrophic metabolism-first hypotheses, a plate-tectonic mechanism is necessary that contains sites of reducing volcanic exhalations. It was shown that the mass extinctions of biological species are influenced by the convection-differentiation mechanism of the endogenic evolution of the Earth’s mantle. Especially LIP-producing eruptions appear to be the principal reason for mass extinction events. Occasionally, bolide impacts cause an extinction event in an ecologically stressed, LIP-generated situation. Section 2 reports on our efforts pertaining to the self-consistent modeling of plate tectonics. To facilitate plate-like motions, two conditions are required, namely a low-viscosity asthenosphere and a deviation from the purely viscous constitutive equation of the lithosphere. Our modeling results show that already relatively simple additional assumptions in a 3-D spherical-shell model of the Earth’s mantle produce oceanic lithospheric plates moving along the Earth’s surface and changing their shape and size as a function of time. Section 3 describes a new model of episodic growth of continental crust (CC). In the case of genetics-first hypotheses or of metabolism-first hypotheses with solar irradiation or lightning energy supply, the existence of CC with epicontinental seas, lagoons and ponds is directly determining for the origin of life. Furthermore, the most important sources of nutrients originate from the upper CC. We put a water-concentration dependent solidus model of mantle peridotite into a 3-D spherical-shell, dynamic mantle model with chemical differentiation that redistributes the heat-producing elements. As a result, we obtain a set of temporal distributions of CC growth episodes that show a certain temporal invariance for a variation of the melting-criterion parameter, f 3. The laterally averaged surface heat flow density qob, the Urey number Ur, and the kinetic creep energy E kin show temporally sinusoidal components superposing a monotonously decreasing curve. Section 4 discusses partly unknown distributions of physical quantities, the knowledge of which is necessary for the computation of a dynamic Martian convection-differentiation system. It is ambiguous whether the early strong Martian magnetic dipole was generated by the more effective core cooling due to a plate-tectonic mode of solid-state convection in the Martian mantle during the first 500 Ma. Section 5 outlines the numerical progress in the advancement of the Terra code that was achieved by cooperation of the international group of Terra developers.	mantle	Uwe Walzer;Roland Hendel	2013		10.1007/978-3-319-02165-2_42	peridotite;extinction event;continental crust;geophysics;plate tectonics;computer science;asthenosphere;mantle (geology);convection;lithosphere;distributed computing	NLP	91.40993724847347	-5.568120043925934	67252
dfcbec1da7ddbc732be97b2d564eadd0c1d7dc82	a simple concrete damage model for dynamic fem applications	finite element method	A simple damage model for concrete is presented. The basic version of the model is a combination between the elastic-damage part of the elastoplastic-damage model of Faria u0026 Oliver and the damage theory of Mazars. This basic version of the model takes into account most of the basic traits of concrete under monotonic static and dynamic loading, like the different response under compression and tension, the stiffness reduction with the increase of external loading and the appearance of softening behavior. This model is further enhanced with a sensitivity to the rate of loading and the ability to simulate cycling behavior, characteristics which are necessary for general cases of dynamic loading. The main advantages of this model are the employment of only one damage parameter and the investigation of the damage state in concrete under static or dynamic loading. The model is implemented into a general three-dimensional finite element program capable of treating static and general dynamic problems. The validation and performance of the proposed model is demonstrated by characteristic numerical examples.	finite element method	George Hatzigeorgiou;Dimitri Beskos;Dimitrios Theodorakopoulos;Manolis Sfakianakis	2001	International Journal of Computational Engineering Science		structural engineering;simulation;engineering;finite element method;mathematics;forensic engineering	SE	83.50117103202827	-11.927500866764907	67325

As the large number of experimental factors involved in metal foams manufacturing, an experimental approach based upon DOE techniques was employed to reduce the trials need for individuating the best process windows. Hence, in such operative ranges, further experimental tests were carried out to trace the full trends of foaming efficiency according to leading parameters, thereby laying the basis to support manufacturers on how to deal with the operative troubles and process settings.

b9e8162214ec5029bce86c378bf6a0fe91c53893	mpm based simulation for various solid deformation		Solid materials are responsible for many interesting phenomena. There are various types of them such as deformable objects and granular materials. In this paper, we present an MPM based framework to simulate the wide range of solid materials. In this framework, solid mechanics is based on the elastoplastic model, where we use von Mises criterion for deformable objects, and the Drucker-Prager model with non-associated plastic flow rules for granular materials. As a result, we can simulate different kinds of deformation of deformable objects and sloping failure for granular materials.	material point method;simulation	Yun-Tao Jiang;Tao Yang;Jian Chang;Shi-Min Hu	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-69487-0_3	computational physics;deformation (mechanics);solid mechanics;plasticity;von mises yield criterion;granular material;materials science	EDA	90.37040194041823	-3.225037165836656	67523

A ball minimizes the former and maximizes the latter, but the conjecture is that a ball is always a minimizer—when there is a minimizer. Even the existence of minimizers for this interesting geometric problem has not been shown in general. We prove the existence of the absolute minimizer (over all A) of the energy divided by A (the binding energy per particle). A second result of our work is a general method for showing the existence of optimal sets in geometric minimization problems, which we call the “method of the missing mass.” A third point is the extension of the pulling back compactness lemma [E.

The silicon purity of the quartz glass is very high, therefore it is excellent in heat resistance, chemical resistance and optical transparency as compared to other glasses, such as borosilicate glass. In this study, the differences in the working process between engineers with different years of experience during the “joint-process” of quartz glass material were analyzed. “Joint-process” is one of “fire-process” and is of heating and jointing glass cylinders during rotating using a dedicated glass lathe machine.

Being an exergy-based diagnostic technique, its performance is influenced by the trends of exergy functions in the “design” and “abnormal” conditions. In this paper the sensitivity of performance of thermoeconomic diagnosis in detecting a fouled direct expansion coil and quantifying the additional consumption it induces is investigated; this fault is critical due to the simultaneous air cooling and dehumidification occurring in the coil, that induce variations in both the chemical and thermal fractions of air exergy. The examined parameters are the temperature and humidity of inlet air, the humidity of reference state and the sensible/latent heat ratio (varied by considering different coil depths). The exergy analysis reveals that due to the more intense dehumidification occurring in presence of fouling, the exergy efficiency of the evaporator coil eventually increases. Once the diagnostic technique is based only on the thermal fraction of air exergy, the results suggest that the performance of the technique increases when inlet air has a lower absolute humidity, as evident from the “optimal performance” regions identified on a psychrometric chart.	air cooling;computer cooling;gantt chart;performance;sensor;software diagnosis	Antonio Piacentino;Pietro Catrini	2016	Entropy	10.3390/e18030085	exergy efficiency;air conditioning;thermoeconomics;thermodynamics;physics	HPC	89.0053209356438	-10.719458582769596	68390

The numerical simulation model of medium flow based on Particle Flow Code (PFC) was established. By setting four kinds of working conditions of amplitude and frequency, the dynamic graphics and curves of the energy field (such as kinetic energy, strain energy, velocity field, force chain and so on) were obtained. In the situation of mid-frequency with large amplitude, the average speed of front medium flow was 1.3–5.03 times that of others and the low-energy region was decreased by 6% to 10%. The largest kinetic energy and strain energy were 3.25 and 2.94 times the average value of others, respectively. The diamond UFG was analyzed in new vibration mills under the conditions of low frequency with large amplitude and mid-frequency with large amplitude.

2fd2db1920a5bacc05eb9c246ba20bed73984dd8	control of invasion direction of cancer cells using hierarchically patterned hydrogel sheets		In this study, we propose a new cell culture system using microengineered hierarchical hydrogel sheets, which enables guidance and evaluation of cancer cell invasion in 3D environments. Three-layered hydrogel sheets, which encapsulated cancer cells in the patterned middle layer, were placed on a collagen hydrogel. Because the direction of nutrition is only from the collagen gel to the sheets, cell invasion was guided to the basal collagen gel as in the case of epithelial tissues. In the experiment, we fabricated hierarchically-engineered alginate-based hydrogel sheets using multi-laminated microfluidic devices, and clearly demonstrated that embedded cancer cells invasion was guided to the collagen layer. By counting the number of cells reaching the collagen gel, the evaluation of cell invasion would become possible. The proposed system would be useful because it realizes facile and precise cell migration assays in 3D platforms.	basal (phylogenetics);embedded system	Manami Sugimoto;Yoichi Kitagawa;Yuya Yajima;Rie Utoh;Masumi Yamada;Minoru Seki	2017	2017 International Symposium on Micro-NanoMechatronics and Human Science (MHS)	10.1109/MHS.2017.8305204	analytical chemistry;microfluidics;cancer cell;biophysics;cell migration assay;cell;materials science;cell culture	Embedded	94.52982478661964	-16.28691503196456	68493

The pump is designed to have three major components, namely a lower glass substrate patterned with a copper micro-coil, a microchannel, and an upper glass cover plate attached a magnetic PDMS diaphragm. When a current is passed through the micro-coil, an electromagnetic force is established between the coil and the magnetic diaphragm. The resulting deflection of the PDMS diaphragm creates an acoustic impedance mismatch within the microchannel, which results in a net flow. In performing the analysis, simulated models of the magnetic field, the diaphragm displacement and the flow rate are developed using Ansoft/Maxwell3D, ANSYS FEA and FLUENT 6.3 CFD software, respectively. Overall, the simulated results reveal that a net flow rate of 52.8 μL/min can be obtained using a diaphragm displacement of 31.5 μm induced by a micro-coil input current of 0.5 A. The impedance pump proposed in this study provides a valuable contribution to the ongoing development of Lab-on-Chips (LoCs) systems.	acoustic coupler;acoustic cryptanalysis;actuator device component;azemiops feae venom;cfd gene;coil gene;characteristic impedance;coil device component;diaphragm (acoustics);displacement mapping;ephrin type-b receptor 1, human;f9 embryonic antigen gene;federal enterprise architecture;flow rate;magnetic fields;maxima and minima;nominal impedance;pdms;psychologic displacement;quantitative impedance;pump (device)	Yu-Hsiang Wang;Yao-Wen Tsai;Chien-Hsiung Tsai;Chia-Yen Lee;Lung-Ming Fu	2010		10.3390/s100404040	embedded system;medical research;telecommunications;bioinformatics;engineering;electrical engineering;nanotechnology;microelectromechanical systems;mechanical engineering	HCI	90.9096810510527	-17.901147236668336	68505

Different from traditional wind turbine generators, flexible belts were designed and demonstrated to harvesting energy using aerodynamically -induced fluttering. Essentially, airflows are used to drive a specifically designed belt to vibrate periodically during fluttering. Nd-Fe-B magnets and outer coils were implemented with the fluttering belt to induce current in the coils. The parameters of the coil are optimized for power output using a FEM tool. Experiments in controllable lab conditions were conducted to compare the performance of the prototype. We propose that such energy transducer can be used as an alternative or complementary power supply to batteries in low power consumer electronics applications.	field electron emission;finite element method;linkage (software);nsa product types;power supply;prototype;transducer;transduction (machine learning)	Fei Fei;Wen Jung Li	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)	10.1109/ROBIO.2009.5420607	electromagnetic induction;wind power;wind speed;control engineering;magnetic flux;electronic engineering;transducer;electromagnetism;engineering;electrical engineering;finite element method;energy harvesting;quantum mechanics	Robotics	89.13707120052388	-18.484666189807193	68511

Adhesion phenomena between inorganic solids are of general interest for mineralization and bone formation processes. Such interfaces are complex systems with many constituents including the hydroxylated metal oxide support, hydrocarbon contamination, ionic water solution and a variety of biopolymers. Our computational methods comprise classical molecular dynamics with around 10 atoms in the 10-100 ns range and ab initio molecular dynamics wit 100-200 atoms for some ps. • Electronic structure calculations show that even very thin layers of TiO on Ti metal may be commensurate and crystalline [1]. A variety of smooth and rough surfaces are implemented in force field simulations. • The oxide is hydroxylated and its surface charge density correlates with the pH-value. The highly hydrophilic TiO is in practice screened by hydrocarbons, which may enhance inflammatory complications of implants [2]. Simulations on the nature of this contamination are presented. • Sequence specific protein adsorption on inorganic surfaces was found in several experiments on inorganic surfaces, even though no key-lock mechanism is conceivable. We propose two effects [3]: (i) Contacts of single amino acid side chains to local charges in the surface have rupture energies, which sensitively depend on the electrostatics. The adhesion of appropriate double contacts is very strong exceeding simple hydrogen bonding. (ii) Soft motifs of proteins easier attach to the surface than rigid helices or strands. • Close to solids water has an ordered structure, which only slightly depends on the surface charge density. These layers hinder protein adsorption. A major difference to the bulk is the reduced water mobility there.	ab initio quantum chemistry methods;amino acids;biopolymers;brain implant;complex systems;computer simulation;digraphs and trigraphs;ecosystem;electronic structure;energy, physics;experiment;force field (chemistry);hydrocarbons;hydrogen bonding;implants;interface device component;ionic;molecular dynamics;muscle rigidity;osteogenesis;physiologic calcification;projection screen;pyschological bonding;sequence motif;steam rupture;trial inclusion and exclusion criteria submission domain;anatomical layer;metal oxide;solid substance;titanium dioxide	Walter Langel;Susan Köppen;Wenke Friedrichs;Armin Marx;Bastian Ohler	2014		10.1186/1758-2946-6-S1-O20	biology;text mining;medical research;medicine;computer science;bioinformatics	Visualization	95.75782243516771	-7.360689482516325	68539

The system is capable to measure changes on the electrical resistance (i.e, temperature) at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, when micropulses are applied on the nano-thickness metallic films deposited on thick substrates. The proposed electronic system is mainly formed by three sections: the micropulses generator section which works with a PIC 16F84A device, the signals processor section (AD712 and LT1210 amplifiers, and an AD734 multiplier/divider), and the data acquisition section integrated by a digital oscilloscope Tektronix model DPO 4050. By applying controlled micropulses on the metallic films and measuring the corresponding changes of the electrical resistance, which are converted at temperature, it is possible to determine the heat capacity of the metallic films at nano-dimensional scale. The proposed electronic system is used to characterize gold thin films deposited on polymeric substrates.

The channels have a small width, leading to a significant influence of the channel walls on fluid flow and heat transfer. Their influence is considered when measuring the temperature distribution along the channel length and the average heat transfer. For this purpose platinum thermistors are integrated directly into the channel structures, which are released from the silicon substrate and made freestanding via deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) and selective dicing. The measurements show that a significant portion of the fluid flows below the pin fins in the clearance bypass region. Heat transfer correlations are developed with a new functional form that considers the strong influence of the clearance-to-diameter ratio on overall heat transfer.	deep reactive-ion etching;higher-order function;pin grid array	R.

For the π-current, the present model represents an improvement of previous approaches to determine ring current intensity. It is proven that the present model is more precise than previous models as they could not explain presence of the minimum in the plot of NICS(πzz) versus distance close to the ring plane. Variations in the charge of molecules and the types of constituent atoms of each species affect the ring current radii of both σ- and π-current loops as well as the height of π-current loops above/below the ring plane. It is suggested that variation in the distribution of the one-electron density in different systems is the main source of differences of the ring current characteristics.	electron;molecular orbital;one-electron universe;ring device	Cina Foroutan-Nejad;Shant Shahbazian;Ferran Feixas;Parviz Rashidi-Ranjbar;Miquel Solà	2011	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.21824	atomic physics;chemistry;organic chemistry;electromagnetic shielding;computational chemistry;aromatic ring current;physics;electron density;aromaticity	Networks	98.06244195876945	-5.361339235012291	68987

The discussion carried out there was acknowledged to be somewhat oversimplified, so that the present paper aims at deepening the views it relied upon and at widening the application field of the model, by taking into account the character, the tastes, and possibly the past experiences of each individual involved in a social relationship. Even the word ''social'' is here understood in a wider sense, ranging from the meaning of a ''purely intellectual'' and ''mainly altruistic'' relationship to that of a ''quite selfish physical (sexual)'' one. From a mathematical viewpoint, the description proposed here still leads to a system of nonlinear integrodifferential stochastic equations. Existence and uniqueness of its solutions, as well as their stability and the possible occurrence of strong instability effects, are not discussed here, and postponed to a future work. The main feature of the paper lies in the explicit introduction of additional parameters related to behaviour, external influences of psychologic as well as practical kind, and the consideration of self-feelings. This leads to introduce and discuss additional relations that are to be considered as ''constitutive laws'' to identify ''psychological types'' or ''classes'' of individuals.

The approach combines an immersed boundary method with a three-component diffuse-interface model and a characteristic MCL model. The immersed boundary method is able to accurately enforce the no-slip boundary condition at the solid surface, thereby circumventing the penetration of the gas and the liquid into the solid by convection. On the other hand, using the three-component diffuse-interface model can prevent the gas and liquid from infiltrating into the solid substrate through the diffusive fluxes during the interface evolution. A combination of these two methods appears to effectively conserve the mass of the phases in the computation. The characteristic MCL model not only allows the contact lines to move on the curved boundaries, but makes the gas-liquid interface to intersect the solid object at an angle in consistence with the prescribed contact angle, even with the variation of surface tangent at the solid substrate. We examine the performance of the approach through a variety of numerical experiments. The mass conservation and interface shapes at equilibrium were tested through the simulation of drop spreading on a circular cylinder. The dynamic behaviors of moving contact lines were validated by simulating the droplet spreading on a flat substrate, and we compared the numerical results against theoretical predictions and previous experimental observations. The method was also applied to the simulations of flows with curved boundaries and moving contact lines, such as drop impact on a sphere and water entry of a sphere. Finally, we studied the penetration process of a two-dimensional drop into a porous substrate that consists of a cluster of circular cylinders.	immersed boundary method;simulation	Hao-Ran Liu;Hang Ding	2015	J.

This knowledge was expressed as known components of one factor, namely the profile matrix. Also, the sum-to-one property of the profile matrix was taken into account by an appropriate sequential normalization. However, our previous approach was unable to check both constraints at the same time. In this work, a new parametrization is proposed which takes into consideration both constraints simultaneously by incorporating a new unconstrained matrix. From this parameterization, new updates rules are introduced which are based on the framework of the Split Gradient Method by Lanteri et al. The cost function is defined in terms of a weighted Frobenius norm and the developed rules involve a new shift in order to ensure the non-negativity property. Simulations on a noisy source apportionment problem show the relevance of the proposed method.	gradient method;non-negative matrix factorization	Robert Chreiky;Gilles Delmaire;Matthieu Puigt;Gilles Roussel;Dominique Courcot;Antoine Abche	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-22482-4_44	mathematical optimization;machine learning;data mining;mathematics	Vision	82.92053522347462	-6.184244057529044	69116
b0b9a3c63a44e1eae37abdf0716df3eb8c712b54	transport of heat and charge in electromagnetic metrology based on nonequilibrium statistical mechanics	transport;electromagnetic;relaxation;nonequilibrium	Current research is probing transport on ever smaller scales. Modeling of the electromagnetic interaction with nanoparticles or small collections of dipoles and its associated energy transport and nonequilibrium characteristics requires a detailed understanding of transport properties. The goal of this paper is to use a nonequilibrium statistical-mechanical method to obtain exact time-correlation functions, fluctuation-dissipation theorems (FD), heat and charge transport, and associated transport expressions under electromagnetic driving. We extend the time-symmetric Robertson statistical-mechanical theory to study the exact time evolution of relevant variables and entropy rate in the electromagnetic interaction with materials. In this exact statistical-mechanical theory, a generalized canonical density is used to define an entropy in terms of a set of relevant variables and associated Lagrange multipliers. Then the entropy production rate are defined through the relevant variables. The influence of the nonrelevant variables enter the equations through the projection-like operator and thereby influences the entropy. We present applications to the response functions for the electrical and thermal conductivity, specific heat, generalized temperature, Boltzmann’s constant, and noise. The analysis can be performed either classically or quantum-mechanically, and there are only a few modifications in transferring between the approaches. As an application we study the energy, generalized temperature, and charge transport equations that are valid in nonequilibrium and relate it to heat flow and temperature relations in equilibrium states.	bloch sphere;cross-correlation;entropy rate;hp 48 series;image noise;lagrange multiplier;quantum fluctuation;relevance;star catalogue	James Baker-Jarvis;Jack Surek	2009	Entropy	10.3390/e11040748	classical mechanics;statistical physics;non-equilibrium thermodynamics;transport;electromagnetism;relaxation;thermodynamics;physics;quantum mechanics	ML	89.70234153883032	0.6163269007434515	69266
9be68f9708be032eaceaab3518aa16cce64ab51d	data reconstruction for a disturbed soil-column experiment using an optimal perturbation regularization algorithm		This paper deals with data reconstruction problem for a real disturbed soil-column experiment using an optimal perturbation regularization algorithm. A purpose of doing the experiment is to simulate and study transport behaviors of Ca2 , Na , Mg2 , K , SO 2− 4 , NO − 3 , HCO − 3 , and Cl − when they vertically penetrating through sandy soils. By data analysis to breakthrough data of the eight kinds of solute ions, two kinds of models describing their transport behaviors in the column are given. One is the advection-dispersion equation with time-dependent reaction terms suitable for three ions of HCO − 3 , NO − 3 , and K , the other is the ordinary advection-dispersion equation suitable for the rest ions. Furthermore, all the unknowns in each model are determined by utilizing the optimal perturbation regularization algorithm, respectively, and then the breakthrough data for each considered ion are reconstructed successfully. The inversion results show that the advectiondispersion model with suitable time-dependent reaction terms can be utilized to describe the experimental process and reconstruct the experimental data.

12b29905b3f9498387bfe5a6a97b7f5f4cb1aead	realization of a soft microrobot with multiple flexible flagella		Ahstract- This work presents an approach to realize soft microrobots with multiple flexible flagella using beaded-fibers driven via a periodic magnetic field. Paramagnetic iron oxide particles are embedded into the polymer matrix of electrospun beaded-fibers and form magnetism upon applying an external magnetic field. We demonstrate that the induced magnetization by an external magnetic field enables self-assembly of multiple adjacent beaded-fibers to form a microrobot with multiple flexible flagella. Frequency response of the assembled microrobot and the individual beaded-fibers is characterized experimentally, and shows that the propulsive force imparted to the fluid by the multiple flexible flagella increases the actuation frequency range of the microrobot and enhances its swimming speed. At relatively high actuation frequency (20 Hz), the average speed of the individual beaded-fiber is 0.11 body-Iength-per-second, whereas the microrobot with multiple flagella swims at an average speed of 0.30 body-Iength-per-second. We also observe a slight difference in the swimming speed between the microrobot with multiple flexible flagella and its constituent beaded-fibers at relatively low actuation frequencies.	embedded system;experiment;frequency band;frequency response;microbotics;polymer;self-assembly	Youssef Hamed;Mohamed Tawakol;Markus Napierkowski;Anke Klingner;Slim Abdennadher;Islam S.

In cylindrical case, there are two possible ways in designing the anode shorts and the authors have proposed an analytical model for each of them. The considered RC-IGBTs are vertical with soft punch-through type buffer designs. The analytical model has been evaluated with the aid of 2-D device simulations and measurements. The authors have investigated the initial snapback phenomenon for different voltage class devices at a given technology (anode and buffer profiles) and found out that the snapback voltage increases with the blocking capability but not the snapback current density. The authors have also observed that the initial snapback phenomenon is more pronounced at lower temperatures. From the analytical model as well as simulation and measurement results, the authors have found that for a given voltage class and technology, the p+-anode width is the only remaining design degree of freedom which determines the initial snapback. The adjustment of the on-state losses can then be done with the proportion of the n+-short region.	snapback (electrical)	Umamaheswara Vemulapati;Nando Kaminski;Dieter Silber;Liutauras Storasta;Munaf Rahimo	2014	IET Circuits, Devices & Systems	10.1049/iet-cds.2013.0222	electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;forensic engineering	EDA	89.79876718357872	-12.346283758013193	69468

We exploit the versatility and performance of the current framework in three typical applications of QM/MM methods to solve biophysical problems: (i) ultrafast proton transfer in malonaldehyde, (ii) conformation of the alanine dipeptide, and (iii) electron-induced repair of a DNA lesion. Also discussed is the further development of the framework, regarding mostly the options for parallelization.	alanine;approximation algorithm;d-alanine transaminase;dipeptides;electron;ewald summation;gromacs;interaction;malondialdehyde;molecular mechanics;parallel computing;particle mesh;protons;qm/mm;quantum mechanics;simulation;tight binding	Tomáš Kubař;Kai Welke;Gerrit Groenhof	2015	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.24029	computational science;molecular dynamics;chemistry;computational chemistry;computational physics;physics;quantum mechanics	HPC	95.41371964228057	-2.08424698368094	69507

This theory generalizes central configurations to include continuum mass distributions. Roughly speaking, if V is the Newtonian potential generated by a unit point mass, a central measure μ for V is a mass distribution in space characterized by the property that gravitational acceleration vector of any x in the support of μ is a constant multiple of the vector from the mass center of μ to x. This formulation includes central configurations as special cases for which central measures are discrete. We show that concentric spherical shells can be properly arranged so that their mass distributions are central measures for V . For any pair of adjacent shells, the ratio of outer and inner radii is between ( 3 √ 2,∞) and this bound is sharp. This provides a bound for outer and inner radii of concentric spheres if the system explodes or collapses homothetically. We also extend our definition of central measure to mollified potential V generated by solid balls, and that allows us to include one-dimensional mass distributions such as circular rings. In this case, we study existence of central measures for concentric circular rings and show a one-dimensional model for which V can be properly chosen so as to make the Lebesgue measure on an interval a central measure.	celestial coordinate system;theory;triune continuum paradigm	Kuo-Chang Chen;Ku-Jung Hsu;Bo-Yu Pan	2017	SIAM J.

In applications like control of ventilation and air conditioning systems, robustness, ease of use, and cost are important issues calling for simple and effective sensor design. This paper investigates the use of commercial-off-the-shelf printed circuit board technologies for the fabrication of calorimetric flow sensors. Such sensors are known to be sensitive when being implemented using thin-film technology. The paper reviews the operation principle of thermal flow sensors and their performance in micromachined silicon technology for comparison. Subsequently, a similar design is introduced where heating and temperature sensing elements are made from standard copper traces on a flexible PCB substrate. Simulation studies demonstrate the basic viability of this approach, even if it might entail some performance penalties. First experimental data of sensor prototypes show that the repeatability of the PCB manufacturing processes is basically sufficient for using copper traces as sensors, but leaves also room for future improvement in both technology and sensor design.	printed circuit board;printing;repeatability;sensor;simulation;tracing (software);usability	Thilo Sauter;Thomas Glatzl;Franz Kohl;Harald Steiner;Almir Talic	2014	Fifteenth International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design	10.1109/ISQED.2014.6783402	calorimeter;embedded system;flow measurement;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;flexible electronics;printed circuit board	EDA	88.25510221176798	-15.853934313734763	69978

The separate transport phenomena in the electrolyte and in the active particle as well as their coupling due to the electrochemical reactions at the interfaces between the electrode particles and the electrolyte will influence the performance and the lifetime of a battery. Any modeling of the complex phenomena during the usage of a battery has therefore to be based on sound physical and chemical principles in order to allow for reliable predictions for the response of the battery to changing load conditions. We will present a modeling approach for the transport processes in the electrolyte and the electrodes based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics and transport theory. The assumption of local charge neutrality, which is known to be valid in concentrated electrolytes, is explicitly used to identify the independent thermodynamic variables and fluxes. The theory guarantees strictly positive entropy production.

By combining the adaptive behavior of BFCs self-regulating energy release with the versatility of biocomputing, we construct a novel gas-controlled biocomputing security system, which could be used as the potential implantable self-powered and 'smart' medical system with the logic diagnosis aim.   RESULTS We have demonstrated a biocomputing security system based on BFCs. Due to the unique 'RESET' reagent of N(2) applied in this work, the prepared biocomputing security system can be reset and cycled for a large number of times with no 'RESET' reagent-based 'waste'. This would be advantageous for the potential practical applications of such keypad lock as well as the development of biocomputing security devices. In order to validate the universality of the system and also to harvest energy directly from biofuels with enhanced power output, we replace the glucose with orange juice as the biofuel to operate BFCs-based biocomputing system, which also possesses the function of keypad lock. In addition, by introducing BFCs into the biocomputing security system, the adaptive behavior of the BFCs self-regulating the power release would be an immense advantage of such security keypad lock devices in potential self-powered implantable medical systems. The designed sequence gives the maximum power output and discriminate itself from the rest of the sequences. From this, we find that maximizing the dimensionless ratio of gap versus SD of the power output spectrum (a funnel in power outputs) gives the quantitative optimal design criterion. Therefore, our construction here may also provide a practical example and microscopic structural basis for mimicking the real biological network systems and bridge the gaps between the theoretical concepts and experiments important for biomolecular systems and synthetic biology.	adaptive behavior;biofuel cells;biofuels;bioinformatics;biological network;eisenstein's criterion;electricity;experiment;glucose;implants;keypad device component;maximum power transfer theorem;optimal design;power (psychology);reagents;synthetic intelligence;systems and synthetic biology;universality probability	Ming Zhou;Xiliang Zheng;Zhongjing Wang;Shaojun Dong	2011	Bioinformatics	10.1093/bioinformatics/btq678	computer science;and gate	Security	96.00851373790512	-17.85336823063648	70299

The sensor membrane for evaluating bitterness, which is caused by acidic bitter substances such as iso-alpha acid contained in beer, needs an immersion process in monosodium glutamate (MSG) solution, called """"MSG preconditioning"""". However, what happens to the lipid/polymer membrane during MSG preconditioning is not clear. Therefore, we carried out three experiments to investigate the changes in the lipid/polymer membrane caused by the MSG preconditioning, i.e., measurements of the taste sensor, measurements of the amount of the bitterness substance adsorbed onto the membrane and measurements of the contact angle of the membrane surface. The CPA values increased as the preconditioning process progressed, and became stable after 3 d of preconditioning. The response potentials to the reference solution showed the same tendency of the CPA value change during the preconditioning period. The contact angle of the lipid/polymer membrane surface decreased after 7 d of MSG preconditioning; in short, the surface of the lipid/polymer membrane became hydrophilic during MSG preconditioning. The amount of adsorbed iso-alpha acid was increased until 5 d preconditioning, and then it decreased. In this study, we revealed that the CPA values increased with the progress of MSG preconditioning in spite of the decrease of the amount of iso-alpha acid adsorbed onto the lipid/polymer membrane, and it was indicated that the CPA values increase because the sensor sensitivity was improved by the MSG preconditioning."""	abbreviations;acids;chloride ion;clarify;conflict (psychology);contain (action);cost per action;cyproterone acetate;experiment;hislopia sp. lb-noda-mh;immersion (virtual reality);manuscripts;membrane potentials;n(6)-cyclopentyladenosine;pa-risc;polymer;polyvinyl chloride;polyvinyls;preconditioner;primula nipponica;sensor;sodium glutamate;thioctic acid;tissue membrane;uveomeningoencephalitic syndrome;methscopolamine bromide	Yuhei Harada;Junpei Noda;Rui Yatabe;Hidekazu Ikezaki;Kiyoshi Toko	2016	Sensors	10.3390/s16020230	chromatography;biochemistry;chemistry;organic chemistry	Mobile	95.97003375932233	-16.293508072196975	70417

The electron mobility is assumed to be a function of the electric field component parallel to the gradient of the quasi-Fermi level. This mobility model eliminates the discrepancy in the conventional absolute-field-value-dependent mobility model, which seriously underestimates the drain current. The calculated results show good agreement with experimental results, even for a device with submicron (0.7- mu m) gate length. This confirms the effectiveness of using the present device simulator in the practical design of GaAs MESFET LSIs. >	simulation	Mayumi Hirose;Jiro Yoshida;Nobuyuki Toyoda	1988	IEEE Trans. on CAD of Integrated Circuits and Systems	10.1109/43.3152	gallium arsenide;electronic engineering;electron mobility;electrical engineering;electric field;simulation modeling;ion implantation;mobility model;quantum mechanics	EDA	89.67348941195351	-9.638548309155649	70526
e2d426fe7ba634001579fcb71bf9e101c5eb3ead	pvc membrane-based portable ion analyzer for hydroponic and water monitoring		Rapid on-site measurement of chemical ions in hydroponic and water solutions would allow efficient management of nutrients used for plant production as well as early monitoring of chemical pollutants. This paper reports the development of an embedded portable analyzer incorporated with a sensor array of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) membrane-based ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) to directly measure the concentrations of NO3, K, and H ions in hydroponic solutions and water. The developed ion analyzer consisted of an AVR microcontroller, five channels of sensor inputs, a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter, a 7-inch LCD touch panel, and SD memory card-based data storage. The use of a two-point normalization method consisting of sensitivity adjustment followed by offset compensation was effective in minimizing signal drifts resulting from a series of sample measurements while reducing variability in response among multiple ISEs during replicate measurements in practical manners. The sensitivity and predictive capability of the PVC membrane-based H ISEs, in conjunction with a three-point calibration method, were satisfactory, showing sub-Nernstian slopes of 51.9–56.1 mV/decade over a pH range of 4–10 (R > 0.96) and providing results in close agreement with the results of a conventional pH meter (a nearly 1:1 regression slope and a y-intercept near 0). A response time of 50 s and a wide sensitivity range of 11– 884 mg L 1 measured with the prototype portable ion analyzer equipped with PVC membrane-based NO3 and K ISEs, each with a lifetime of 60 days, enabled direct analysis of hydroponic and water samples without the need to dilute samples. Strong linear relationships between the prototype ion analyzer and the standard instrument methods (R > 0.97, slopes ranging from 0.89 to 1.24) were exhibited. 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Although many hydrogel based materials have been proposed for high intensity ultrasonic field characterization, no one fully satisfies the requested acoustic and optical properties. Using concentrated salts solutions and different polysaccharide molecules, a simple preparation method has been developed to obtain this new class of TMMs. Physical properties of these TMMs have been investigated by an accurate mechanical and acoustic characterization. Furthermore, a short discussion about the mechanism of ultrasonic attenuation given by salts solutions embedded in polymeric matrix has been conducted. Finally, by means of an experiment on protein denaturation induced by HIFU, the different mechanism underlying lesions formation occurring in a transparent TMM with and without salt has been revealed. Shown results supply a new starting point for the production of TMMs suitable for HIFU characterization.	acoustic cryptanalysis;embedded system	Adriano Troia;Rugiada Cuccaro;Alessandro Schiavi	2015	2015 IEEE International Symposium on Medical Measurements and Applications (MeMeA) Proceedings	10.1109/MeMeA.2015.7145185	materials science;ceramic materials;biological engineering	Embedded	93.88748143255972	-17.28252169838331	70767

The transferability of the derived parameters has been tested against Pseudo Potential-Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PP-PBE) calculations and experimental values (whenever available) for corresponding bulk systems (e.g., hexagonal close packing, zinc-blende, and wurtzite(wz)), various kinds of nanostructures (such as nanowires, surfaces, and nanoclusters), and also some small molecular systems. Our results show that the derived parameters reproduce the structural and energetic properties of the above-mentioned systems very well. With the derived parameter set, one can study zinc-chalcogenide nanostructures of relatively large size which was otherwise prohibited by other methods. The Zn-Cd parametrization developed in this article will help in studying large semiconductor hetero-nanostructures of Zn and Cd chalcogenides such as ZnX/CdX core/shell nanoparticles, nanotubes, nanowires, and nanoalloys.	cefadroxil;nanostructured materials;nanotubes;nanowires;population parameter;pseudo brand of pseudoephedrine;semiconductor;set packing;simian t-lymphotropic virus-pp;status epilepticus;tellurium;tight binding;trial elements domain;william l. burke;zaf;zinc pyrithione 10 mg/ml medicated shampoo	Supriya Saha;Sougata Pal;Pranab Sarkar;A.

CH3 NH3 PbI3 is the most efficient light harvester among all the known halide perovskites (PSCs). It is regarded as unsuitable for long-term stable solar cells, thus it is necessary to develop other types of PSC materials to achieve stable PSCs (Wang et al., Nat. Energy 2016, 2, 16195). Because of this, various research efforts are on-going to discover novel lead-based or lead-free single/double PSCs, which can be stable, synthesizable, transportable, abundant and efficient in solar energy conversion. Keeping these factors in mind, we report here the electronic structures, energetic stabilities and some materials properties (viz. band structures, density of states spectra and photo-carrier masses) of the PSC chloroammonium lead triiodide (ClNH3 PbI3 ). This emerges through compositional engineering that often focuses on B- and Y-site substitutions within the domain of the BMY3 PSC stoichiometry. ClNH3 PbI3 is found to be stable as orthorhombic and pseudocubic polymorphs, which are analogous with the low and high temperature polymorphs of CH3 NH3 PbI3 . The bandgap of ClNH3 PbI3 (values between 1.28 and 1.60 eV) is found to be comparable with that of CH3 NH3 PbI3 , (1.58 eV), both obtained with periodic DFT at the PBE level of theory. Spin orbit coupling is shown to have a pronounced effect on both the magnitude and character of the bandgap. The computed results show that ClNH3 PbI3 may act as a competitor for CH3 NH3 PbI3 for photovoltaics. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	ammonia measurement;dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry;electronic band structure;electronic structure;halide;halogens;john d. wiley;long-term support;mind;multi-function printer;network address translation;pancreatic stellate cells;primary sclerosing cholangitis;semiconductor;set of ch3 cholinergic cells;solar cell;viz: the computer game;methylammonium ion;neutrophil	Pradeep R.

Our design has evolved from the type which we provided for an earlier deep-sea trial. The primary features of our present receiver are an InGaAs planar p-i-n photodiode with passivation and antireflection coating and a Si bipolar integrated circuit, both encapsulated in a special chip carrier. Both the photodiode and the amplifier are placed in the same carrier so that a direct chip-to-chip wire bond can minimize stray capacitance, which helps to maximize sensitivity. The back-illuminated structure of the photodiode allows the InP substrate to serve as a window in the hermetically sealed carrier. Since both active devices are in a separate package from the passive components, they can undergo the high temperature bake-out and hermetic seal followed by the high temperature high bias purge necessary to assure the reliability of the semiconductors. This optical chip carrier is then mounted inside another hermetic package which contains the passive components, including the optical fiber pigtail, which must undergo bake-out and seal at more moderate temperatures. Within the constraints of reliability, bandwidth, and dynamic range, the physical structure of the integrated circuit and its bias conditions have been chosen to maximize sensitivity. The design of the circuit enables us to select those devices from a production lot which will achieve the highest sensitivity in a completed receiver. This receiver is used in systems operating with NRZ data from 140 to 440 Mbit/s. At 1.3 μm and 296 Mbit/s the mean sensitivity achieved was an average optical power\bar{P} = -35.6dBm for a 10-9bit error rate (BER), with a best value of -36.3 dBm. This receiver is physically robust, being able to withstand stresses well in excess of those encountered in actual use. Preliminary aging data indicate that a long-term failure rate of less than 2.5 in 109device hours can be achieved.	amplifier;bit error rate;chip carrier;conformal coating;data rate units;dbm;dynamic range;failure rate;fiber cable termination;fiber-optic communication;integrated circuit;lightwave 3d;megabit;offset binary;optical fiber;pin diode;sl (complexity);semiconductor;sensitivity and specificity;wire bonding;x.690	Michael L.

In the system of the invention, unstable combustion of the liquefied gas due to vapor lock in the pipe means can be prevented even when the gas supply pressure is below the vapor pressure of the gas. Besides, the calorific value obtained with the system is variable over a wider range than with a conventional system.

A precursor solution containing protein molecules and sodium alginate (Na-Alg), a buffer solution, and a gelation solution were introduced into the microfluidic devices, forming composite microfibers comprising Ca-Alg and the protein. After chemically cross-linking the protein molecules and removing the alginate polymer, microfibers made of proteins were obtained. We demonstrated two processes, uniform fiber production using a simple microchannel and parallel production of narrow fibers using multilayered microfluidic devices. As an application, we cultured mammalian cells within hydrogel matrices incorporating gelatin microfibers, and evaluated the effects of the fibers on cell proliferation and network formation. The presented microfluidic process would be useful for fabricating cell-sized microfibers made of proteins which are applicable to 3D cell cultivation and tissue engineering.	network formation;numerical aperture;polymer	Hisataka Hiramatsu;Ayaka Hori;Yuya Yajima;Masumi Yamada;Minoru Seki	2016	2016 International Symposium on Micro-NanoMechatronics and Human Science (MHS)	10.1109/MHS.2016.7824194	materials science;nanotechnology;polymer chemistry	Comp.	94.35178297970474	-15.975928976305369	71201

The arrays of micropillars occupy the entire channel height and detect the passage of the particle through their gaps by monitoring changes in the electrical resistance. Impedance measurements were employed in order to characterize the electrical equivalent model of the system and to detect the passage of particles in real-time. Three different geometrical micropillar configurations were evaluated and numerical simulations that supported the experimental activity were used to characterize the sensitive volume in the channel. Moreover, the signal-to-noise-ratio related to the passage of a single particle through an array was plotted as a function of the dimension and number of micropillars.	analyzer, device;antenna analyzer;approximation error;bead dosage form;cell adhesion;characteristic impedance;electronic circuit;flow;hoc (programming language);microelectrodes;nominal impedance;numerical analysis;particle;polystyrenes;preparation;quantitative impedance;real-time clock;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;silicon;simulation;electric impedance;electrode	Elena Bianchi;Enrica Rollo;Samuel Kilchenmann;Francesco M.

High sensitivity to small changes in the boundary such as wall roughness or dynamic excitations can trigger transition to undesirable states. One approach to preventing or delaying a transition is to introduce a simple control loop along the boundary to reduce the sensitivity. In this work we demonstrate the aforementioned idea for a system governed by the one dimensional Burgers' equation. In particular, we focus on the initial boundary value problem for a viscous Burgers' equation which is known to be is extremely sensitive with respect to a small perturbation in a Neumann boundary condition. We use this model to illustrate how this sensitivity can generate erroneous numerical solutions and “transitions” to these states. In particular, for a fixed viscosity and certain initial data the numerical solution z(x, t) of Burgers' equation with a Neumann boundary condition zx(0, t) = 0 converges to a (large) solution that satisfies zx(0, t) = -α for a number α >; 0 less than machine precision zero. Thus, the solution of the Burgers' equations for this problem exhibits an extreme sensitivity to the boundary perturbation α and this sensitivity can produce unexpected and undesired dynamic behavior. We use a continuous sensitivity equation method to compute these sensitivities and show that the sensitivity can be eliminated by introducing a very simple proportional error boundary feedback mechanism.	control system;control theory;feedback;lyapunov fractal;machine epsilon;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method;numerical partial differential equations;parabolic antenna;relevance	Edward J.

4a9a66bc00aa3eeb5d24af48a8ffc5b79fade9be	the application of metamodels based on soft computing to reproduce the behaviour of bolted lap joints in steel structures		A promising field of research in steel structures regarding their preliminary design and optimization is the replacement of expensive computational finite element models with more efficient techniques. Without a significant loss of accuracy, new proposals should be able to consider not only the ideal load-displacement response but also relevant failure mechanisms and imprecisions in material properties. The article proposes the use of metamodels based on soft computing as an overall approximation system for structures analysis. This approach has been applied in several fields but, till nowadays, its implementation on structural analysis in early esign seems quite limited to a few theoretical cases. Taking advantage of artificial neural network as global approximation technique, the parameters for more realistic and informative load-displacement curve including nonlinear effects (damage mechanics) are estimated for bolted steel lap joints. Our results demonstrate the accuracy of the metamodel implemented can be close to simulations and also real experimental tests.	metamodeling;soft computing	Julio Fernández-Ceniceros;Ruben Urraca-Valle;Javier Antoñanzas-Torres;Andrés Sanz-García	2013		10.1007/978-3-319-01854-6_16	structural engineering;engineering;forensic engineering;engineering drawing	NLP	84.15640790069746	-13.153803144416392	71886

To analyze the performance of some popular functionals for redox reactions in manganese systems, calculated O--H bond dissociation enthalpies for Mn-ligands in six different complexes are compared to experimental results. In this benchmark, B3LYP performs well with a mean absolute error of 3.0 kcal/mol. B98 gives similar results to B3LYP (error of 3.8 kcal/mol). B3LYP* gives lower O--H bond strengths than B3LYP and has a mean error of 5.0 kcal/mol. Compared to B98 and B3LYP, B3LYP* has an error trend for the manganese ligands that is more similar to the error for a free water molecule. The nonhybrid functional BLYP consistently and significantly underestimates the O--H bond strengths by approximately 20 kcal/mol. HCTH407 has a rather large mean error of 9.4 kcal/mol and shows no consistent trend. The results support the use of hybrid functionals and the present computational method for large model systems containing manganese. An example is the oxygen evolving complex in photosystem II where hybrid functionals predict the appearance of a Mn(IV)-oxyl radical before the O--O bond formation step.	approximation error;benchmark (computing);computation;duoxa1 gene;hybrid functional;hydroxyl radical;ligands;transition elements;kilocalorie;photosystem ii oxygen evolving complex	Marcus Lundberg;Per E.

The π-π* excitation energies are computed for BM and its derivative 2,6-di-tert-butyl (di-t-Bu) BM. The behaviors of the computed excitation energies with increasing solvent polarity are in good agreement with those of the corresponding experimental measurements. In addition, analysis of the solute-solvent interaction energies and spatial distribution functions reveals that the effects of the solvent on the absorption spectra are reduced by the steric hindrance of the t-Bu groups. Furthermore, from the difference in the solute-solvent interaction energies of BM and di-t-Bu BM, it is shown that the effect of the t-Bu substituents on the absorption spectrum is greater in high-polarity solvents.	behavior;diabetes insipidus;energy, physics;excitation;functional theories of grammar;hartree–fock method;ploidies;time-dependent density functional theory;merocyanine;polarity;solute;tert-butyl alcohol	Yuichi Tanaka;Norio Yoshida;Haruyuki Nakano	2015	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.23980	solvatochromism;stereochemistry;photochemistry;chemistry;organic chemistry;solvent effects	Comp.	96.7394278312385	-5.446941707175345	72084

The overall tensorial properties scale isotropically, i.e. according to a power law with common exponent. In fault systems modelled by sets of 2-D cracks, the scaling is isotropic for both isotropically oriented and mutually perpendicular cracks. In the extreme anisotropic case of one set of parallel cracks, all effective compliances but one become zero, the non-vanishing component being scale independent. For isotropically oriented or mutually orthogonal cracks the wave propagation is characterised by extreme scattering, since any wave path is almost certainly intersected by a crack. The waves are not intersected only in the case of one set of parallel cracks. However, in this case due to its extreme anisotropy only extremely long waves (longer than all faults) can propagate.	fractal;image scaling;self-similarity;software propagation;triune continuum paradigm	Arcady V.

In this study, a hybrid computational model was developed for the simulation of whole-cell migration behaviors. The model integrates sub-models of reaction-diffusion, actin filaments (F-actin) and the plasma membrane. Reaction-diffusion was calculated as if enclosed by a moving membrane. Individual F-actins were reorganized on the basis of stochastic kinetic events, such as polymerization, capping, branching and severing. Membrane dynamics were modeled using an optimization of energy function that depends on cell volume, surface area, smoothness and the elasticity of F-actin against the membrane. Simulations of this model demonstrated self-organization of F-actin networks, as in lamellipodia, and chemotactic migration. Furthermore, this method was extended to address external obstacles to simulate the dynamic cellular morphological changes seen during invasive migration.	actins;behavior;computational model;computer simulation;cytoskeleton;elasticity (data store);frequency capping;kinetics;lamellipodia;mathematical optimization;microfilaments;migration, cell;multiphysics;plasma active;plasma membrane;self-organization;tissue membrane;transduction (machine learning);intracellular signal transduction	Seigo Nonaka;Honda Naoki;Shin Ishii	2011	Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society	10.1016/j.neunet.2011.06.009	computer simulation;actin;cell migration;self-organization;bioinformatics;surface area;multiphysics;reaction–diffusion system;kinetics	Robotics	92.93862917115383	-0.9149169145035071	72214

AI(Nd g 3 wt.%) alloy films are adequate for AMLCD fabrication because of their low resistivity and their tendency not to form hillocks during thermal processing. The use of both optical light scattering and nanoindentation for the rapid evaluation of hillock formation has been demonstrated, along with the use of ramped resistance measurements for observing the process of discontinuous precipitation (the combination of Al grain growth and Ai-Nd compound precipitation). AI(Nd) films were further characterized by TEM and AFM to confirm the effect of their finely dispersed Al-Nd compound precipitates on decreased grain size and decreased hillock formation. Introduction Since the early 1980s, the size and complexity of AMLCDs have increased dramatically, with a projected market value of 7-15 billion dollars in the year 2000 [1]. These trends are expected to continue, with increased penetration into the desktop display market [2]. Scaling analysis []] has shown that lower-resistivity gate metals, such as Al alloys, will be required for larger, higher-resolution displays. Unlike the refractory metals or alloys currently used, the thermal expansion mismatch between Al films and the glass substrate of an AMLCD can result in the formation of hillocks [3, 4] and/or whiskers [5] during display fabrication. Whisker formation occurs when grain growth is suppressed during heat treatment of Al films, causing localization of the stress relief [5]. Alloying Al films with transition metals can minimize hillock or whisker formation [6-9]. Key requirements for gate-line materials for TFT/LCD arrays are low resistivity (£=5 /xfi-cm), resistance to stress migration (no formation of hillocks or whiskers), good adhesion to glass, and the ability to be patterned with a	3d film;active-matrix liquid-crystal display;atomic-force microscopy;desktop computer;internationalization and localization;metal gate;requirement;stress migration;thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display;transistor	Hiroshi Takatsuji;Evan G.

A magnetic pulse is used to generate eddy currents in the object, which in the presence of a static magnetic field induces Lorentz force based acoustic waves in the medium. This time resolved acoustic waves are collected with ultrasound transducers and, in the present work, these are used to reconstruct the current source which gives rise to the MAT-MI acoustic signal using vector imaging point spread functions. The reconstructed source is then used to estimate the conductivity distribution of the object. Computer simulations and phantom experiments are performed to demonstrate conductivity reconstruction through vector source imaging in a circular scanning geometry with a limited bandwidth finite size piston transducer.

904b39bc9ba64548fa78ef1c62a2c96d786064ee	numerical simulation analysis on the flow field characteristics of electric-controlled pressure amplifier for ultra high pressure common rail system		On the basis of introducing the working principle of the electric-controlled pressure amplifier for ultra high pressure common rail system, the three dimension flow field characteristics model of it was built by FIRE software, and the accuracy of this model was verified by the pressure curve in pressurization chamber which obtained via the ultra high pressure common rail system injection characteristic experiment, then the numerical simulation analysis on the three dimensional flow field characteristics of electric-controlled pressure amplifier was conducted based on the model, and the flow field pressure and velocity distribution law during the pressurization process were obtained. The results show that when the flow field of pressurization oil circuit is at the end of compression stroke, the highest pressure mainly distributed around the outlet of electric-controlled pressure amplifier, and the maximum velocity mainly distributed around the oil inlet passage of one-way valve chamber and pumping chamber. When the flow field of control oil circuit is at the end of compression stroke, the pressure in control volume reduced greatly, and the pressure of control volume outlet orifice was less than critical pressure during pressurization process, which may lead to the occurrence of gasification phenomenon.

The degree to which new functionalities of magnetic clusters, quantum dots, bio-molecules or carbon nanowires can be exploited for specific applications depends heavily on our ability to design devices with optimal behavior in response to external stimulation, such as applied voltage. While the basic physical effects are often well understood, quantitative simulations with predictive power that do not rely on empirical models and parameters pose a major challenge. This is due to the large numerical effort of the calculations, to accurately describe quantum effects at atomic and larger distances. Therefore, modern quantum simulations in material science depend heavily on efficient algorithms and powerful computer hardware. During the past ten years, first-principles calculations based on the densityfunctional theory (DFT) emerged as the most powerful framework to respond to the demands mentioned above on a microscopic level. By first-principles is meant, that the parameters of the theory are fixed by the basic assumptions and equations of quantum mechanics. The overwhelming success of the densityfunctional theory for the description of the ground-state properties of large material classes including organic molecules and bio-molecules, insulators, semiconductors, semimetals, half-metals, simple metals, transition-metals and rareearths in bulk, at surfaces and as nanostructures such as fullerenes and nanotubes makes it the unchallenged foundation of any modern electronic structure based materials. In this talk I will explore the opportunities of petaflop computing for materials science. Petaflop computing opens the path for the treatment of the van der Waals interaction of molecules, the chemical reactions of bio-molecules and the treatment of strongly-correlated electrons, where concept of individual electrons breaks down. These problems benefit from the advent of massively parallelized computers. Conclusions for the method development for massively parallelized computers are drawn. M. Bubak et al.

a06dfc1de2eba16335f392f8bf97d196fa3480d2	molecular electronic density fitting using elementary jacobi rotations under atomic shell approximation	molecular electronics	Fitted electron density functions constitute an important step in quantum similarity studies. This fact not only is presented in the published papers concerning quantum similarity measures (QSM), but also can be associated with the success of the developed fitting algorithms. As has been demonstrated in previous work, electronic density can be accurately fitted using the atomic shell approximation (ASA). This methodology expresses electron density functions as a linear combination of spherical functions, with the constraint that expansion coefficients must be positive definite, to preserve the statistical meaning of the density function as a probability distribution. Recently, an algorithm based on the elementary Jacobi rotations (EJR) technique was proven as an efficient electron density fitting procedure. In the preceding studies, the EJR algorithm was employed to fit atomic density functions, and subsequently molecular electron density was built in a promolecular way as a simple sum of atomic densities. Following previously established computational developments, in this paper the fitting methodology is applied to molecular systems. Although the promolecular approach is sufficiently accurate for quantum QSPR studies, some molecular properties, such as electrostatic potentials, cannot be described using such a level of approximation. The purpose of the present contribution is to demonstrate that using the promolecular ASA density function as the starting point, it is possible to fit ASA-type functions easily to the ab initio molecular electron density. A comparative study of promolecular and molecular ASA density functions for a large set of molecules using a fitted 6-311G atomic basis set is presented, and some application examples are also discussed.	ab initio quantum chemistry methods;algorithm;approximation;basis set (chemistry);coefficient;computation;curve fitting;electronic density;jacobi method;paper;quantitative structure–activity relationship;scanning electron microscopy;scientific publication;seizures;electron density	Lluís Amat;Ramon Carbó-Dorca	2000	Journal of chemical information and computer sciences	10.1021/ci0000272	classical mechanics;chemistry;molecular electronics;computer science;organic chemistry;computational chemistry;physics;quantum mechanics	ML	96.96495736318626	-3.0631207338847894	72530

Different from global shimming, localized off-resonance can be corrected by using multi-coil shimming. Previously, integrated RF and shimming coils have been used to implement multi-coil shimming. Such coils share the same conductor for RF signal reception and shim field generation. Here we propose a new design of the integrated RF-shim coil at 3-tesla, where two independent shim current paths are allowed in each coil. This coil permits a higher degree of freedom in shim current distribution design. We use both phantom experiments and simulations to demonstrate the feasibility of this new design.	coil device component;computational human phantom;experiment;leg bag freedom t-tap kit coloplast #7077;license;magnetic fields;magnetic resonance imaging;numerous;phantoms, imaging;radio frequency;regulatory factor x1;shims;shim (computing);simulation	Jiazheng Zhou;Ying-Hua Chu;Yi-Cheng Hsu;Pu-Yeh Wu;Jason P.

The switched state is obtained by current injection of 180-1000 mA. The lifetime of the injection carrier is calculated to be 6.8 ns from the measurement of switching delay time. On the basis of these fundamental switching characteristics, the reduction of the operation current and the improvement of the modulation bandwidth are theoretically investigated. It is shown that the operation current as low as 3 mA will be attained for the switch with a 6"""" crossing angle and that high-speed operation up to 2 GHz will be achieved by increasing the doping level in the core layer.

It is argued that the relevant CSA concepts for this purpose are the minimum energy coordinates (MEC) and populational normal modes (PNM), of collective displacements of electron populations of constituent atoms, and the associated mode sensitivities. The illustrative example is the 126 atom,  large  (L), stoichiometric cluster of vanadium pentoxide, including two (010)-layers of the VO 5  pyramids, which we use to test the adequacy of the previous  small  (S), two-pyramid model of the surface active site of V 2 O 5  adopted to study alternative chemisorption complexes with toluene. The present analysis demonstrates a remarkably localized character of the MEC associated with atoms of the central S-fragment in L. This supports the adequacy of the cluster approximation. These MEC suggest an enlargement of S by an inclusion of at least its nearest-neighbor surface pyramids and the relevant vanadyl oxygens of the second layer pyramids, through which the vanadium atoms of the first (surface) layer are coordinated to the second layer. The Fukui function (FF) distribution resulting from the L-cluster charges exhibits in the surface layer negative values only on vanadium atoms, while all oxygen atoms (singly-, doubly- and triply-coordinated) exhibit positive FF indices, in good correlation with their positive and negative charges in the cluster, respectively.

The motivation to examine semiconductor spintronics is stimulated by recent materials advances in magnetic semiconductors and the prospect of device applications, either not feasible or ineffective with conventional electronics. Near term applications include, for example, nonvolatile magnetic random access memory and spin-controlled logic, while in the long term a realization of a spin-based quantum computer is sought. However, in contrast to the well-established modeling of semiconductor charge-based devices, modeling efforts in semiconductor spintronics have only begun. In this talk we focus on our proposal for the spinpolarized [1] and magnetic p-n junctions [2,3]. We generalize the drift-diffusion equations and the appropriate numerical algorithms to the case of spin-polarized transport in semiconductors. In particular, we predict the amplification of spin density [1] and the spin-voltaic effect [2,3], where due to injected nonequilibrium spin, a charge current can flow even at no applied bias. [1] I.

In this investigation, the design, optimization, fabrication, and measurements of the sensor are involved. By analyzing the stress distribution and deflection of sensitive elements using finite element method, a novel structure featuring high concentrated stress profile (HCSP) and locally stiffened membrane (LSM) is built. Curve fittings of the mechanical stress and deflection based on FEM simulation results are performed to establish the relationship between mechanical performance and structure dimension. A combination of FEM and curve fitting method is carried out to determine the structural dimensions. The optimized sensor chip is fabricated on a SOI wafer by traditional MEMS bulk-micromachining and anodic bonding technology. When the applied pressure is 1 psi, the sensor achieves a sensitivity of 30.9 mV/V/psi, a pressure nonlinearity of 0.21% FSS and an accuracy of 0.30%, and thereby the contradiction between sensitivity and linearity is alleviated. In terms of size, accuracy and high temperature characteristic, the proposed sensor is a proper choice for measuring pressure of less than 1 psi.		Chuang Li;Francisco Cordovilla;R.

The hybrid approach is combined with singular perturbation technique to get steady-state phase diagrams and density profiles. We have thoroughly examined the role played by the strength of bottleneck, binding constant and lane-changing rate in the system dynamics. The appearances of bottleneck-induced shock, a bottleneck phase and Meissner phase are explained. Further, the critical values of bottleneck rate are identified, which signify the changes in the topology of phase diagram. It is also found that an increase in lane-changing rate as well as unequal attachment, detachment rates weaken the bottleneck effect. Our theoretical arguments are in good agreement with extensively performed Monte Carlo simulations. A two-channel TASEP with LK in the presence of a static bottleneck is studied.Symmetric coupling environment is used.A hybrid approach, based on mean-field approximation, has been introduced.Steady-state phase diagrams and density profiles have been derived and analyzed.The effect of bottleneck rate and coupling strength has been analyzed.	monte carlo method;simulation	Isha Dhiman;Arvind Kumar Gupta	2016	J.

904f2793024d12332c2ac26475f196fe34542847	restoration of an afm height image using a deflection image at different scanning speeds		The principle of the Atomic Force Microscope involves scanning an object using a probing tip that is mounted on the free end of a micro mechanical cantilever. While the sample is scanned horizontally the cantilever deflects. The deflection of the cantilever can be sensed among several methods. For instance, optical beam deflection where this method is often used because of it's simplicity. While the scanning process of the sample stage, the detected deflection is compared with the set point deflection. Then, the error signal which is the difference between the detected and set point deflection is minimized by moving the sample stage in the Z — direction. At a set point value this closed-loop feedback operation can maintain the cantilever deflection and hence the tip — sample interaction force. The sample surface is approximately traced by the resulting 3D movement of the sample stage. Therefore, usually the topographic image can be formed from the electrical signals which are used to drive the sample stage scanner in the Z-direction. In this paper, the AFM topographic image is constructed using values obtained by summing the height image that is used for driving the Z-scanner and the deflection image with a weight function that is close to 3. The value of has been determined experimentally using trail and error. This method gives more faithful topographic image.	atomic-force microscopy;circuit restoration;experiment;star height;topography;weight function	A. Ahtaiba;A. Abdulhadi;H. Amreiz;O. Imrayed;M.

Polydimethylsiloxane that contained photochromic diarylethene changed its color depending on wavelengths of irradiated laser beams. Transmission characteristics of this polymer were examined by using laser pulses of 405 (violet), 450 (blue), or 532 nm (green) wavelength as photonic signals. When violet or green signal pulses (1 kHz or 1 kbps) were launched into this polymer, an optical path was formed in self-organized manner, and consequently, the output signal intensity increased as time passed. By contrast, the intensity of blue pulses decreased gradually, since they erased their optical path by themselves.	data rate units;interconnection;pdms;polymer;powerpc 400;self-organization	Mitsunori Saito;Takamasa Hamazaki;Kohei Sakiyama	2017	2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)	10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081430	optoelectronics;optical fiber;photonics;diarylethene;polymer;photochromism;wavelength;laser;optical path;optics;materials science	HPC	93.27732007984251	-12.388328045998612	73527

We study effect of these defects in three segments of the array (near-input, center and near-output) and we have observed that location of these defects play an important role in masking of the errors. The observed simulation results indicate that most of the defects occurring around center and near-output would be masked generating correct behavior while defects in the near-input segment would mostly cause erroneous output.

Seawater from the Polish coast (the Baltic Sea) and the same water combined with various amounts of crude oil extracted from the Baltic Sea shelf (Petrobaltic-type oil) were used in this study. The FI values were calculated for excitation and emission wavelengths found at the maximal peak, taking into account the natural seawater and the seawater artificially contaminated (for an oil-to-water ratio range of 0.5 × 10-6 - 500 × 10-6). The wavelength configurations (Ex/Em) (225/355 and 225/340) for the FI index were applied. It was found that, independent of the amount of oil, the FI achieves a higher value for natural seawater than for seawater that has had contact with oil. These results provide the basis to design a sensor signaling the appearance of oil in a defined sea area.	cell signaling;excitation;expanded memory;extraction;horowitz index:ratio:pt:bldc+inhl gas:qn;maximal set;petroleum;population parameter;seawater;tomography, emission-computed;wavelength	Emilia Baszanowska;Zbigniew Otremba	2017		10.3390/s17061276	seawater;chemistry;environmental engineering;environmental chemistry	HCI	96.20681432238676	-17.077516111380145	73837

The current gold-standard assay, live-mouse lethality, exhibits high sensitivity but has limitations including long assay times, whereas other assays evince rapidity but lack factors such as real-time monitoring or portability. In this study, we aimed to devise a novel detection system that could detect BoNT at below-nanomolar concentrations in the form of a stretchable biosensor. We used a field-effect transistor with a p-type channel and electrodes, along with a channel comprising aligned carbon nanotube layers to detect the type E light chain of BoNT (BoNT/E-Lc). The detection of BoNT/E-Lc entailed observing the cleavage of a unique peptide and the specific bonding between BoNT/E-Lc and antibody BoNT/E-Lc (Anti-BoNT/E-Lc). The unique peptide was cleaved by 60 pM BoNT/E-Lc; notably, 52 fM BoNT/E-Lc was detected within 1 min in the device with the antibody in the bent state. These results demonstrated that an all-carbon nanotube-based device (all-CNT-based device) could be produced without a complicated fabrication process and could be used as a biosensor with high sensitivity, suggesting its potential development as a wearable BoNT biosensor.

In this study, a solid-shell finite element model is implemented into the explicit finite element software ABAQUS/Explicit as a user-defined element, through which the sheet metal forming processes are simulated. The main feature of this finite element model is that the solid-shell element formulation is embedded into an explicit finite element procedure, compared to the previous studies on the solid-shell elements under the implicit finite element framework. To obtain a straightforward element, a complete integration scheme is adopted. No loss of generality, a twelve-parameter enhance assumed strain method is employed to improve the element’s behavior. Two benchmarks from the NUMISHEET conference and a U-channel roll-forming process are simulated with this explicit solid-shell finite element model. The calculated results are comparable with experimental and numerical results presented in the literatures.	benchmark (computing);embedded system;finite element method;numerical analysis;simulation;subroutine	L.

In this paper, we proposed a direct free energy interpolation (DFEI) method based on the temperature dependent phonon density of states (TD-PDOS) reduced from molecular dynamics simulations. Using the DFEI method, after anharmonic free energy corrections we reproduced the thermal expansion coefficients, the specific heat, the thermal pressure, the isothermal bulk modulus, and the Hugoniot   P     P       –  V     V       –  T     T        relationships of Cu easily and accurately. The extensive tests on other materials including metal, alloy, semiconductor and insulator also manifest that the DFEI method can easily uncover the rest anharmonicity that the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA) omits. It is thus evidenced that the DFEI method is indeed a very efficient method used to conduct anharmonic effect corrections beyond QHA. More importantly it is much more straightforward and easier compared to previous anharmonic methods.	molecular dynamics	Zhong-Li Liu;Rui Li;Xiu-Lu Zhang;Nuo Qu;Ling-Cang Cai	2017	Computer Physics Communications	10.1016/j.cpc.2016.12.017	molecular dynamics;condensed matter physics;physics;quantum mechanics	ML	92.67135436657962	-5.899186326447554	74542
8aa0060e9a6dc4346bc461330837ce099472ea7a	characterization of atomic layer deposited low-k spacer for fdsoi high-k metal gate transistor		FDSOI is one of the alternative device architectures chosen to extend CMOS scaling for high-k metal gate. FDSOI is ideal for applications needing a balanced trade-off among power, performance and cost, such as the Internet of Things (IoTs). One of the challenges in FDSOI integration is to obtain a low gate to source drain capacitance (overlap capacitance or DC capacitance). To enable this, low k spacer material is needed. In this study we compared two ALD low-k spacer materials namely SiOCN and SiBCN against the conventional SiN spacer. Material characterization reveals SiOCN has lower etch rate than SiBCN. Both materials have good thermal stability. Transistors with SiOCN and SiBCN spacers were formed. Implementation of low-k spacer does not have significant impact on VT variability and oxygen ingress. Transistors with SiOCN and SiBCN spacer exhibited lower DC and AC capacitance without transistor resistance degradation.	atomic layer deposition;cmos;debian;elegant degradation;high-κ dielectric;image scaling;internet of things;metal gate;spacer gif;spatial variability;transistor	D.

The beam monitoring system consisted of 128 optical fibers optically coupled to photo-multiplier tubes. The performance of the beam monitoring system based on FORS was verified by comparing 2D dose maps of square-shaped fields of various sizes, which were obtained using conventional dosimeters such as MatriXX and EBT3 film, with those measured using FORS. The resulting full-width at half maximum and penumbra were compared for PBS proton beams, with a ≤2% difference between each value, indicating that measurements using the conventional dosimetric tool corresponded to measurements based on FORS. For irregularly-shaped fields, a comparison based on the gamma index between 2D dose maps obtained using MatriXX and EBT3 film and the 2D dose map measured by the FORS showed passing rates of 96.9 ± 1.3% and 96.2 ± 1.9%, respectively, confirming that FORS-based measurements for PBS proton therapy agreed well with those measured using the conventional dosimetric tools. These results demonstrate that the developed beam monitoring system based on FORS is good candidate for monitoring the entrance dose map in PBS proton therapy.	cns disorder;dosimeter, device;eye;map;optical fiber;photomultiplier;proton therapy;protons;radionuclide imaging;sensor;specimen source codes - tube;verification of theories;proton beam;width	Jaeman Son;Se Byeong Lee;Youngkyung Lim;Sung Yong Park;Kwanho Cho;Myonggeun Yoon;Dong Ho Shin	2018		10.3390/s18010227	optical fiber;beam (structure);proton therapy;analytical chemistry;engineering;pencil-beam scanning;radiation;proton;dosimeter	Mobile	94.37066963990912	-21.8477424396276	74659

Recent experiments have provided growing evidence for the radical-ion-pair magnetoreception mechanism, while recent theoretical advances have unravelled the quantum nature of radical-ion-pair reactions, which were shown to manifest a host of quantum-information-science concepts and effects, like quantum measurement, quantum jumps and the quantum Zeno effect. We here show that the quantum Zeno effect provides for the robustness of the avian compass mechanism, and immunizes its magnetic and angular sensitivity against the deleterious and molecule-specific exchange and dipolar interactions.	angularjs;atomic electron transition;aves;biological processes;experiment;interaction;ions;large;measurement in quantum mechanics;photosynthetic reaction centers;population parameter;quantum hall effect;quantum zeno effect;quantum information science;singlet state;triplet state;united states public health service;magnetometers;magnetoreception	A.

First, it is shown that the electron may form bound states (solectrons) with externally, mechanically excited solitons in the lattice thus leading to one form of soliton-mediated transport. These solectrons generally move with supersonic velocity. Then, in a thermally excited lattice, it is shown that solitons can also trap electrons, forming similar solectron bound states; here, we find that ET based on hopping can be modeled as a diffusion-like process involving not just one but several solitons. It is shown that either of these two soliton-assisted modes of transport can facilitate ET over quite long distances.		Manuel G. Velarde;Alexander P. Chetverikov;Werner Ebeling;Dirk Hennig;John J.

The developed biosensor consists of one-port surface acoustic wave (SAW) reflective delay lines on a 41° YX LiNbO3 piezoelectric substrate, a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) waveguide layer, and two different sensitive films. The Love wave biosensor was wirelessly characterized using two antennas and a network analyzer. The binding of the analytes to the sensitive layers induced a large change in the time positions of the original reflection peaks mainly due to the mass loading effect. The assessed time shifts in the reflection peaks were matched well with the predicted values from coupling of mode (COM) modeling. The sensitivities evaluated from the sensitive films were ~15 deg/µg/mL for the rabbit IgG and ~1.8 deg/ng/mL for COMP.	acoustic cryptanalysis;analyzer, device;cartilage;dropping;immunoglobulin g;megahertz;methacrylates;packet analyzer;piezoelectricity;polyhydroxyethyl methacrylate;polymethyl methacrylate;port (circuit theory);selectivity (electronic);sensor;surface acoustic wave device component;voltage divider;waveguide device component;analyte;anatomical layer	Haekwan Oh;Chen Fu;Kunnyun Kim;Kee-Keun Lee	2014		10.3390/s141121660	love wave;electronic engineering;transducer;telecommunications;analytical chemistry;computer aided design;antenna;miniaturization;sound;physics;wireless;biosensor	Vision	93.3353978846253	-18.170341017486894	75265

The FSLBM uses a volume of fluid approach to reduce the problem of a liquid-gas two-phase flow to a single-phase free surface simulation. In bubbly flows compression effects leading to an increase or decrease of pressure in the suspended bubbles cannot be neglected. Therefore, the free surface simulation is augmented by a bubble model that supplies the missing information by tracking the topological changes of the free surface in the flow. The new model presented here is capable of handling the effects of bubble breakup and coalesce without causing a significant computational overhead. Thus, the enhanced bubble model extends the applicability of the FSLBM to a new range of practically relevant problems, like bubble formation and development in chemical reactors or foaming processes.	algorithm;coalescing (computer science);computation;dot-com bubble;lattice boltzmann methods;null (sql);numerical analysis;numerical method;overhead (computing);simulation;star trek: first contact;steam rupture;test case;two-phase locking	Daniela Anderl;Simon Bogner;Cornelia Rauh;Ulrich Rüde;Antonio Delgado	2014	Computers & Mathematics with Applications	10.1016/j.camwa.2013.06.007	statistical physics;simulation;volume of fluid method;lattice boltzmann methods;free surface;thermodynamics;physics	Robotics	92.7839000640399	0.3516419344695693	75405

Here, we investigate the influence of the solvent representation in the harmonic model by comparing estimates of changes in the vibrational entropies for 30 trypsin/ligand complexes on ligand binding. Second derivatives of Amber generalized Born (GB) solvation models are available in the nucleic acid builder code. They allow one to use these models for the calculation of vibrational entropies instead of using a simpler solvation model based on a distance-dependent dielectric (DDD) constant. Estimates of changes in the vibrational entropies obtained with a DDD model are systematically and significantly larger, by on average, 6 kcal mol(-1) (at T = 300 K), than estimates obtained with a GB model and so are more favorable for complex formation. The difference becomes larger the more the vibrational entropy contribution disfavors complex formation, that is, the larger the ligand is (for the complexes considered here). A structural decomposition of the estimates into per-residue contributions reveals polar interactions between the ligand and the surrounding protein, in particular involving charged nitrogens, as a main source of the differences. Snapshots minimized with the DDD model showed a structural deviation from snapshots minimized in explicit water that is larger by, on average, 0.5 Å RMSD compared to snapshots that were minimized with GB(HCT) . As experimental vibrational entropies of biomacromolecules are elusive, there is no direct way to establish a solvent model's superiority. Thus, we can only recommend using the GB harmonic model for vibrational entropy calculations based on the reasoning that smaller structural deviations should point to the implicit solvent model that closer approximates the energy landscape of the solute in explicit solvent."""	accessible surface area;approximation;assisted model building with energy refinement (amber);cell nucleus;charge (electrical);epilepsy, generalized;estimated;implicit solvation;interaction;large;ligand binding;ligands;molecular mechanics;nucleic acids;poisson–boltzmann equation;reasoning;small;solvent models;water model;free energy;kilocalorie;solute	Hannes Kopitz;Daniel A.

Reaction routes, involving intramolecular nitrogen atom insertion at varying position in the carbon chain of C6N, are analyzed for the isomerisation between linear isomers of C6N. Through an automated and systematic search performed with global reaction route mapping of the potential energy surface, thermal isomerisation pathways for C6N radical are proposed based on the computations carried out at CASSCF/aug-cc-pVTZ, and CCSD(T)/6-311++G(d,p)//B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) levels of the theory. Notably, a high lying linear isomer, centrosymmetric with respect to the nitrogen atom, is observed to be stabilized by a unique crossover three center-four electron π long bond between the carbon atoms that are spatially separated by a nitrogen atom in a natural bond orbital. This long bond is concluded to be responsible for the predicted thermal isomerisation to be more feasible than the dissociation during the isomerisation pathway of a linear isomer of C6N.

However, most research on distributed deformation monitoring has focused on solid rectangular beams rather than box girders-a kind of typical hollow beam widely employed in actual bridges. The deformation of a single-cell box girder contains bending deflection and also two additional deformations respectively caused by shear lag and shearing action. This paper revises the improved conjugated beam method (ICBM) based on the long-gage fiber Bragg grating (LFBG) sensors to satisfy the requirements for monitoring the two additional deformations in a single-cell box girder. This paper also proposes a suitable LFBG sensor placement in a box girder to overcome the influence of strain fluctuation on the flange caused by the shear lag effect. Results from numerical simulations show that the theoretical monitoring errors of the revised ICBM are typically 0.3⁻1.5%, and the maximum error is 2.4%. A loading experiment for a single-cell box gilder monitored by LFBG sensors shows that most of the practical monitoring errors are 6⁻8% and the maximum error is 11%.	alzheimer disease 2;alzheimer disease, familial, 1;approximation algorithm;bending - changing basic body position;biological evolution;coefficient;computer simulation;experiment;flange device component;immunostimulating conjugate (antigen);numerical analysis;quantum fluctuation;requirement;revision procedure;stmn1 gene;simulation;state or province of exposure to illness:loc:pt:^patient:nom;tissue fiber;sensor (device)	Sheng Shen;Shao-Fei Jiang	2018		10.3390/s18082597	electronic engineering;fiber bragg grating;gauge (instrument);box girder;deformation monitoring;engineering	Mobile	91.71561735073983	-20.5106958602944	75910

However, for thin film samples, the time-of-flight within a layer is less than the duration of the THz pulse and consequently there is insufficient range resolution for NDE of the sample under test. In this paper, matched field processing (MFP) techniques are applied to thickness estimation in THz TOF tomography applications, and these methods are demonstrated by using measured THz spectra to estimate the the thicknesses of a thin air gap and its depth below the surface. MFP methods have been developed over several decades in the underwater acoustics community for model-based inversion of geo-acoustic parameters. It is expected that this research will provide an important link for THz researchers to access and apply the robust methods available in the MFP literature.	acoustic cryptanalysis;air gap (networking);auditory perceptual disorders;intel terahertz;less than;magnetic resonance imaging;modality (human–computer interaction);nonlinear acoustics;thickness (graph theory);time of flight;anatomical layer;non-t, non-b, calla negative childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia;tomography	Scott Schecklman;Lisa M.

In a research environment, moving to smaller device dimensions requires experimentation with new chamber types and materials to overcome challenges with Moore's Law. To make the most of expensive mainframes and clean room floor space multiple chamber types can be placed on one mainframe. Although this type of configuration can reduce cost while evaluating new complex processes, the efficiency of the tool as a whole can be drastically reduced. A major bottleneck within tools configured with multiple process chambers can be the load locks. These load locks are the single wafer entry point into the vacuum chamber.

Essential electrical aspects of electrospinning are often ignored. Observations of electrical phenomenon and adjustments of experimental variables in an electrospinning process are needed to create a feedback system for controlled electrospinning. In this paper, conductivity of the polymer solution, together with concentration and surface tension of the polymer solution, were adjusted to conduct controlled electrospinning. Nanofibers of polyacrylonitrile and polyvinylidene fluoride were successfully electrospun, with specified diameters in the range from 100 nm to 400 nm.	diameter (protocol);experiment;interaction;polymer;real-time clock	Suqi Liu;Kevin White;Darrell H.

The stress distribution of femur under bending moment and compressive load is simulated using finite element method (FEM) in this paper. A two-dimensional FEM model is established according to the dimension of a typical human femur. The bending moments are obtained by shifting the load action point to the outward lateral direction. Four excursion lengths 0mm, 5mm, 10mm and 15mm are tested. The deformation and stress distribution of femur, the stress in the cross section of femoral head, neck and femoral shift under bending moment and compressive load are obtained. It can be found from the numerical results that there is obvious stress concentration at femoral neck and tension stress occurs in the outside while the compressive stress occurs in inner side. In the cross section of femoral shaft, tension stress again occurs in the outside and compressive stress occurs in inner side. The femur stress increases significantly with the bending moment.

Lock-in thermal imaging is based on the periodic thermal excitation of the specimen under test. Resulting surface temperature oscillations are recorded with an infrared camera and allow the detection of variations of the sample's thermophysical properties under the surface. In this paper, the steady-state and transient skin surface temperatures are numerically derived for a different stage of development of the melanoma lesion using a two-dimensional axisymmetric multilayer heat-transfer model. The transient skin surface temperature signals are demodulated according to the digital lock-in principle to compute both a phase and an amplitude image of the lesions. The phase image can be advantageously used to accurately detect cutaneous melanoma at an early stage of development while the maximal phase shift can give precious information about the lesion invasion depth. The ability of lock-in thermal imaging to suppress disturbing subcutaneous thermal signals is demonstrated. The method is compared with the previously proposed pulse-based approaches, and the influence of the modulation frequency is further discussed.

We examine two types of treatments for the active orbitals that are partially occupied. The first treatment, as denoted by LIMO(C), is a simple application of the conventional LIMO method to the union of the inactive core and the active orbitals. The second, as denoted by LIMO(S), separately treats the inactive core and the active orbitals. Numerical tests to compare the two treatments clarify that LIMO(S) is superior to LIMO(C). Further applications of LIMO(S) to various systems demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness.

bfecae2c15eb10fc1c0ba4199a117d626ff2675c	a snapback-free reverse conducting igbt with recess and floating buffer at the backside		We propose two novel ways to alleviate the reverse conducting insulated gate bipolar transistor (RC-IGBT) snapback phenomenon by introducing the floating field stop layer with a lightly doped p-floating layer and recess structure at the backside. The floating field stop layer is submerged in the N-drift region and located several micrometers above the P+ anode region, which would not degrade the blocking capability but can suppress the snapback phenomenon effectively. When the collector length exceeds 100μm, the snapback voltage VSB of the floating field stop RC-IGBT with the p-floating layer can be less than 0.5 V. Furthermore, the recess structure at the backside can separate the N+ short and P+ anode region, which will be beneficial to eliminate the snapback. Finally, an RC-IGBT with a floating buffer layer and recess at the backside is proposed. Compared to the RC-IGBT featuring an oxide trench between the N+ short and P+ anode, the proposed one has utilized the simple recess structure to replace the costly oxide trench and achieved the identical characteristics simultaneously.	blocking (computing);circuit complexity;clutter;doping (semiconductor);insulated-gate bipolar transistor;rc circuit;rf modulator;radio frequency;snapback (electrical)	Jiaqiang Xie;Li Ma;Wei Li;Yong Gao;Ning Mei Yu	2017	IEICE Electronic Express	10.1587/elex.14.20170677	electronic engineering;snapback;computer science;electrical engineering;insulated-gate bipolar transistor	Security	90.82499105902396	-13.105743987062654	76778

A finite dipole is a pair of equal and opposite strength point vortices separated by a finite distance. The dynamics of multiple finite dipoles in an unbounded inviscid fluid was first proposed by Tchieu, Kanso, and Newton in Tchieu et al. (Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. A, Math. Phys. Eng. Sci. 468(2146):3006–3026, 2012) as a model that captures the “far-field” hydrodynamic interactions in fish schools. In this paper, we formulate the equations of motion governing the dynamics of finite dipoles in a doubly periodic domain. We show that a single dipole in a doubly periodic domain exhibits periodic and aperiodic behavior, in contrast to a single dipole in an unbounded domain. In the case of two dipoles in a doubly periodic domain, we identify a number of interesting trajectories including collision, collision avoidance, and passive synchronization of the dipoles. We then examine two types of dipole lattices: rectangular and diamond. We verify that these lattices are in a state of relative equilibrium and show that the rectangular lattice is unstable, while the diamond lattice is linearly stable for a range of perturbations. We conclude by commenting on the insight these models provide in the context of fish schooling.	almost periodic function;control theory;epr paradox;helium;interaction;newton;perturbation theory;quantum vortex;self-propelled particles;synchronization (computer science);vortex	Alan Cheng Hou Tsang;Eva Kanso	2013	J.

4e5363e3799e78239128bc0e27627384ea10ebd1	inverse estimation of temperature profiles in landfills using heat recovery fluids measurements		In addition to leachate and gas emission analysis, temperature variations in municipal solid waste landfills are routinely monitored for safety and health reasons, such as the increased production of biogas or the danger of spontaneous combustion phenomena if the temperature exceeds 70– 75◦C. The increasing constraints on greenhouse gas emissions and the convenience of fuel and heat recovery have helped develop a global approach to landfills’ operation andmaintenance, generally referred to as bioreactor landfill management. The heat recovery piping we are presently designing can be a significant part of this approach. The heat gained by a fluid circulated in a closed network through the landfill is transferred to an external heat exchanger or used directly as warm water. Additionally, it can help reduce landfill temperature levels and control biogas generation. Since the pipes diameter is large enough to allow for a radial temperature gradient, this information can be used for an inverse estimation of the temperature profile in the landfill which constitutes the boundary conditions of the resulting heat transfer problem. In this paper, we describe an algorithm for regularising the resulting ill-posed free boundary estimation problem using sampled data of the heat recovery fluid on exiting the landfill.	algorithm;bessel filter;coefficient;cross section (geometry);dummy variable (statistics);estimation theory;gradient;radial (radio);relative intensity noise;sensor;spontaneous order;well-posed problem	Carlo Solisio;Andrea P.

Under the condition of no water leaking on sieve plate, the larger the sieve hole diameter is, the lower the pressure drop of air is, and the less the blower energy consumption is. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

782a6638e9fb037aac13c5f334403f45f8a001ad	a flexible and robust modelling framework for multi-stream heat exchangers		Heat exchangers are important units in most industrial processes. They involve physical phenomena such as condensation and evaporation including several boiling regimes. Different types of heat exchangers constructed for different applications may differ much in geometrical design. This work explains and demonstrates a modelling framework which is capable of handling a multitude of geometries and relevant physical phenomena affecting the performance of the heat exchangers. The data structure and governing equations are explained, before the framework is demonstrated for a particular challenging test case with a heat exchanger operating similar to the main heat exchanger in a single mixed refrigerant cycle.

The flow is recorded in the front view plane with a high speed camera for a Reynolds number of 1500 and a global void fraction of 0.14%. An image processing algorithm is developed in order to discriminate bubbles accumulated in clouds near the inner cylinder (cloud bubbles) from bubbles trapped in the bulk flow by vortices (swirl bubbles). The analysis of the preferential positions, azimuthal velocities and equivalent void fraction of clouds and swirl bubbles separately provides new insight into the dynamics of the bubble’s entrapment.

We investigated theoretical limitations, performance of imagers, and physical properties of fabrics in both the regions. In order to investigate the time stability of detection, we performed measurements in sessions each lasting 30 min. We present a theoretical comparison of two spectra, as well as the results of experiments. In order to compare the capabilities of passive imaging of hidden objects, we combined the properties of textiles, performance of imagers, and properties of radiation in both spectral ranges.

39dff05ce5d083edbfe32f9e9e5efb1328ff9ee6	pod analysis of the wake behind a circular cylinder coated with porous media	cylinder;porous media;wake;piv;pod	The wake of a circular cylinder coated with porous media was experimentally investigated by hot-wire anemometry, particle image velocimetry (PIV) and smoke-wire visualization. Mean velocity and Reynolds stresses in the streamwise and lateral are eliminated obviously for porous layer coating, especially in the centerline. The vortex formation length is elongated, and the width of the wake region is expanded by coating porous media. The Strouhal number of vortex shedding is 0.162 for the porous cylinder, which is smaller than 0.182 for the bare one due to the widened wake. Additionally, porous layer significantly regulates the flow field, which can be detected distinctly by smoke-wire visualization and transient PIV data. The proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) was further used to analyze PIV data with a view to extract dominant coherent structures in the wake. Moreover, a phase-averaged low-order model was applied to provide a comprehensive description of the dynamics of the first four modes. The first two POD modes, showing the signature of asymmetrical vortex shedding and predominating in the wake of the bare cylinder, are weakened dramatically for porous layer coating and present abrupt degradation in the midline. Meanwhile, mode 3 and mode 4, representing the symmetrical vortex shedding, occupy higher energy for porous cylinder. The study reveals that the porous layer coating delays the roll-up of shear layer and weakens the interaction between them, and thus, the vortex region is shifted further downstream.	cylinder-head-sector	Chao Xia;Zheng Wei;Haidong Yuan;Qiliang Li;Zhigang Yang	2018	J.

The frame is formed lower than the mounting level of the reduction gear mechanism. A gear cover for covering the gear mounting space is attached on the frame. A stopper for defining the default opening and a stopper for defining the full-closed position of the throttle valve are juxtaposed so as to enable position adjustments in the same direction. These stoppers serve to stop a default lever and a throttle gear, thereby enabling downsizing, weight reduction, and rationalization of fabrication and adjustments of an electronically controlled throttle device.

These magnetic gradients are superposed on a sufficiently high homogeneous magnetic field (e.g. the Bo field of a MR scanner) to achieve maximum propelling force through magnetization saturation of the MNPs. As previously demonstrated by our group, such technique was successful at maintaining microcarriers along a planned trajectory in the blood vessels based on tracking information gathered using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequences from artifacts caused by the same MNPs. Besides propulsion and tracking, the same MNPs can be synthesized with characteristics that can allow for the diffusion of therapeutic cargo carried by these MR-navigable carriers through the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) using localized hyperthermia without compromising the MRN capabilities. In the present study, localized hyperthermia induced by an alternating magnetic field (AC field) is investigated for the purpose of transient controlled disruption of the BBB and hence local delivery of therapeutic agents into the brain. Here, an external heating apparatus was used to impose a regional heat shock on the skull of a living mouse model. The effect of heat on the permeability of the BBB was assessed using histological observation and tissue staining by Evans blue dye. Results show direct correlation between hyperthermia and BBB leakage as well as its recovery from thermal damage. Therefore, in addition to on-command propulsion and remote tracking, the proposed navigable agents could be suitable for controlled opening of the BBB by hyperthermia and selective brain drug delivery.	blood - brain barrier anatomy;blood vessel;call of duty: black ops;denial-of-service attack;drug delivery systems;dyes;embedded system;embedding;evans blue;extravasation;fever;gradient;heat-shock response;heating;magnetic fields;magnetic resonance imaging;magnetic resonance spectroscopy;microbotics;morphologic artifacts;quantum superposition;scanner device component;shock;spectral leakage;staining method;therapeutic agent (substance);recurrent childhood brain stem glioma	Seyed Nasr Tabatabaei;Sonia Duchemin;Hélène Girouard;Sylvain Martel	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ICRA.2012.6225041	biomagnetism;heat shock;saturation;magnetic field;engineering;magnetic resonance imaging;nanotechnology;nanoparticle;biological engineering;nuclear magnetic resonance	Robotics	97.31443384887743	-21.63858778477726	77974

In particular, in micro machining, the tolerances, depth of cut, and even workpiece sizes are in micro scale.  Micromachining can overcome the shortcomings of micro fabrication techniques (such as lithography and etching) with limitation  of work materials (mostly on silicon) and geometric forms (2 or 2.5 dimensions) (Byrne et al. 2003; Liu et al. 2004). One  very versatile micro-machining process is micro-milling. Micro-milling has advantages over other micro-machining techniques  with respect to the types of workable materials and the free-form 3D micro structures with high aspect ratios and high geometric  complexity. However, in micro-milling, with the miniaturisation of the cutting tool (<1 mm in diameter), and the use of high  speed (>10,000 rpm), the tool wears quickly. It is critical to monitor the tool wear in micro-machining due to the high precision  required. Compared to conventional machining, the noise component in the signal for monitoring micro-machining is usually  very high and difficult to separate (Tansel et al 1998; Zhu et al. 2007). This phenomenon makes it difficult to apply TCM  in micro-machining.  	hidden markov model;markov chain	K. P.

Random telegraph noise (RTN) and 1/f noise analysis are employed to characterize the process induced trap (PIT) and the stress induced trap (SIT) in the tunnel oxide of the floating gate memory cells. The relationship between RTN traps and the read current fluctuation after different P/E cycles is analyzed from a microscopic perspective. Experimental results show that discernible transition between RTN and 1/f noise can be detected at the initial phase of the cycling (<;100 cycles), depending on the gate bias voltage (Vg). As the cycle number increases, the transition phenomenon disappears and 1/f noise dominates. This phenomenon can be detected both in program and erase states, and is interpreted by spectroscopy analysis of PIT and SIT.	biasing;burst noise;computer recycling;flash memory;memory cell (binary);pink noise;quantum fluctuation	Xiaonan Yang;Jing Liu;Zhiwei Zheng;Yan Wang;Dandan Jiang;Shengfen Chiu;Hanming Wu	2015	2015 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium	10.1109/IRPS.2015.7112748	flicker noise;burst noise;electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	90.83623303226723	-11.42396129945509	78372

In this paper we derive a model for the diffusion of strongly sorbed solutes in soil taking into account diffusion within both the soil fluid phase and the soil particles. The model takes into account the effect of solutes being bound to soil particle surfaces by a reversible nonlinear reaction. Effective macroscale equations for the solute movement in the soil are derived using homogenization theory. In particular we use the unfolding method to prove the convergence of nonlinear reaction terms in our system. We use the final, homogenized model to estimate the effect of solute dynamics within soil particles on plant phosphate uptake by comparing our double-porosity model to the more commonly used single porosity model. We find that there are significant qualitative and quantitative differences in the predictions of the models. This highlights the need for careful experimental and theoretical treatment of the plant-soil interaction when trying to understand solute losses from the soil.	nonlinear system;unfolding (dsp implementation)	Mariya Ptashnyk;Tiina Roose	2010	SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics	10.1137/080729591	homogenization	ML	93.60106416491061	-3.070385085823899	78542

A mathematical model, which considers fresh concrete as a non-Newtonian fluid, is developed. The aggregates are considered as Lagrangian particles whose trajectories determine segregation. Aggregate segregation is partially affected due to concrete viscosity. The study presented here will show the relationship between viscosity and segregation during fill of fresh concrete in formwork. The relationship in between aggregate segregation and viscosity during the fill of fresh concrete for both MC concrete mixture and MCS concrete mixture is investigated. MCS concrete mixture includes superplasticizers for the same composition of MC. Cylindrical formwork (30 cm by 150 cm) is employed. It is found that MC concrete mixture has an aggregate segregation level of 50%, while it reduces to a level of 20% for MCS concrete mixture. The use of superplasticizer reduces aggregate segregation.	numerical analysis	Ahmet Bilgil;Baki Ozturk;Halis Bilgil	2005	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2003.12.086	superplasticizer;applied mathematics;mathematical model;mathematics;quantum mechanics;statistics	Crypto	90.35444787260789	3.2305115313933372	78595

The moisture content of tea affects the quality and durability of the product. Some electrical devices have been proposed to measure the moisture content of tea leaves but are not practical. Their performance is influenced by material density and packing. The official oven method is time-consuming. In this study, the moisture content of Oolong tea was measured by the equilibrium relative humidity technique. The equilibrium relative humidity, and temperature, of tea materials were measured by using temperature and relative humidity sensors. Sensors were calibrated, and calibration equations were established to improve accuracy. The moisture content was calculated by using an equilibrium moisture content model. The error of the moisture content determined with this method was within 0.5% w.b. at moisture <15% w.b. Uncertainty analysis revealed that the performance of the humidity sensor had a significant effect on the accuracy of moisture determination.	calibration;durability (database systems);erh gene;exposure to humidity;kind of quantity - equilibrium;plant leaves;population parameter;regression analysis;set packing;tea;contents - htmllinktype;sensor (device)	Andrew Chen;Hsuan-Yu Chen;Chiachung Chen	2014		10.3390/s140815593	tiny encryption algorithm;water;chemistry;uncertainty analysis;temperature;environmental chemistry;humidity;physics	Mobile	96.970331744674	-18.288870996397147	78617
00876baaece571f644eb3b8c32bc50580c496887	a theoretical study of the si-o bond in disiloxane and related molecules	siloxanes;ab initio;mndo;force constants	A comparison of semi-empirical (MNDO) and ab initio (GAUSSIAN) calculations for disiloxane and related molecules is given. The STO-3G* basis set well produced the observed geometries of disiloxane (less than SiOSi observed 144 degrees, calculated 140 degrees), dimethoxy-dimethylsilane (less than OSiO obsd tetrahedral, calc 102 degrees), methyl silyl ether (less than COSi obsd 121 degrees, calc 118 degrees) and correctly predicted the planar geometry found for cyclotrisiloxane. In contrast, more complex basis sets (3-21G(*), DZP, TZVP) gave much poorer agreement with the observed geometries. Comparison of the STO-3G* and the STO-3G basis sets demonstrates the necessity of including d-orbitals on the silicon. However, the semi-empirical MNDO program gave, despite the absence of d-orbitals, a better approximation to the molecular geometry than the complex ab initio basis sets. Force field parameters have been calculated for kSiOSi, kOSiO, 0.089 and 0.73 mdyneA/rad2, and the SiOSiO torsion which has a V1 potential of -0.68 kcal/mol. In addition, the HSiOH torsion is shown to have a three-fold potential of 0.78 kcal/mol. These are profoundly different from the analogous carbon-oxygen force constants, demonstrating that C-O parameters cannot be transferred to the corresponding Si-O systems.	2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine;approximation;basis set (chemistry);duoxa1 gene;gaussian (software);international system of units;less than;libreoffice calc;mndo;methylmethacrylate;openbsd;oxygen;semiconductor industry;silicon;torsion (gastropod);disiloxane;kilocalorie	Raymond J.

The FACETS code will be used to predict the performance of tokamak discharges and to optimize tokamak discharge scenarios. Novel parallel numerical algorithms and solvers have been developed in the FACETS project in order to simulate the multi-scale dynamics of tokamak plasmas. The status of development of modules for anomalous transport in the FACETS code is described in this paper. Mechanisms that are used for coupling 1D anomalous transport in the plasma core together with 2D transport in the plasma edge (in near separatrix and scrape-off-layer regions) are considered.

a76bbf414599b57aa35721067d5f0ebcc35d3e09	an alternative approach to measure alpha-particle-induced seu cross-section for flip-chip packaged sram devices: high energy alpha backside irradiation		To evaluate a device sensitivity against alpha particles, traditional Single Event Effect (SEE) tests are conducted using isotope source, which emits particles just above 5 MeV. Relentless downscaling and higher packing density have driven the demand of developing increasingly complex packaging: smaller, thinner, having enormous input/output pins count per chip. Flip-chip bonded devices meet all these demands, but their testing against alpha particles is a big challenge. The range of alpha ions, emitted by the isotope sources, is very short, which precludes their penetration till active circuit – from either side of the chip. This paper presents an evidence that high energy alpha irradiation can potentially be used to measure and correlate alpha SEE cross-section for such devices. The proposed method uses high energy alpha particles, directed from the backside of die, to mimic low energy (~ 5 MeV) at the sensitive volume (SV). The incident particles penetrate the entire silicon substrate and deposit charge in the SV to induce upsets. The energy and LET of an ion at the SV, having traversed the entire substrate, is determined using TRIM. SEE experiments are performed on 14 nm FinFET SRAM devices, assembled in flip-chip and wire-bonded structures, respectively, for backside and traditional top-side testing. High energy alpha irradiations were simulated using CREME-MC – a Geant4 based Monte Carlo transport code. Tests and simulation results, for traditional and proposed methods, are presented for correlation.	flip chip;single event upset;static random-access memory	Saqib A.

Thermodynamic model and simulation of this variable-mass compression process are devised. Differential equations are formulated and used to calculate the amount of liquid injected and the work to drive the compressor on the basis of simplification, taking into consideration the factors such as the isentropic efficiency of the compressor and the degree of superheating. Compared with the ordinary adiabatic compression, an example of steam compression with water injection is illustrated. The results show that the compression work is reduced and the discharge temperature decreases.	computer case screws;computer cooling;discharger;dry loop;level of detail;simulation	Jian Qui;Zhaolin Gu;Guoguang Cai	2004	IJCAT	10.1504/IJCAT.2004.006643	superheated steam;simulation;computer science;heat recovery steam generator;engineering drawing;water injection;mechanical engineering	HCI	85.06335594356827	-11.158132644115097	79164

The Cahn–Hilliard equation is a deterministic model for the dynamics of alloys which has proven to be fundamental for the understanding of several types of phase separation behavior. However, stochastic effects occur in any physical experiment and thus need to be incorporated into models. While white noise is one standardly chosen option, it is not immediately clear in which way the noise characteristics affect the resulting patterns. In this paper we study the effects of not necessarily small colored noise on pattern formation in a stochastic Cahn–Hilliard model in the nucleation regime. More precisely, we focus on degenerate noise which acts either on isolated eigenmodes or with a welldefined spatial wavelength. Our studies show that the types of resulting patterns depend critically on the spatial noise frequency, and we can explain via numerical continuation methods that if this spatial frequency is too high, then pattern formation is significantly impaired by the underlying structure of the system. In addition, we provide rigorous bounds on the nucleation time frame in the degenerate stochastic setting.	average-case complexity;bandlimiting;colors of noise;experiment;image scaling;importance sampling;normal mode;numerical analysis;numerical continuation;numerical method;pattern formation;periodic boundary conditions;sampling (signal processing);simulation;stochastic process;verification and validation;white noise	Dirk Blömker;Evelyn Sander;Thomas Wanner	2016	SIAM J.

The effect of this perturbation on the stability of the spiral waves of electrochemical activity is not clear. We used the FitzHugh-Nagumo model of an excitable medium to model the conduction of the activation waves in a two-dimensional system with inhomogeneous anisotropy level. Inhomogeneity of the anisotropy level was modeled by adding Gaussian noise to diffusion coefficients corresponding with lateral coupling of the cells. Low noise levels resulted in a stable propagation of the spiral wave. For large noise level conduction was not possible due to insufficient coupling in direction perpendicular to fibers. For intermediate noise intensities, the initial wave broke up into several independent spiral waves or waves circulating around conduction obstacles. At an optimal noise intensity, the number of wavelets was maximized-a form of anti-coherent resonance was obtained. Our results suggest that the inhomogeneity of conduction anisotropy may promote wave breakup and hence play an important role in the initiation and perpetuation of the cardiac arrhythmias.	anisotropy;coefficient;coherence (physics);excitable medium;fitzhugh–nagumo model;lateral computing;lateral thinking;myocardium;noise (electronics);normal statistical distribution;resonance;sinoatrial node;software propagation;spiral wave;tissue fiber;wavelet	Pawel Kuklik;Lukasz Szumowski;Prashanthan Sanders;Jan J.

In the former aspect, NSNs will dissolve in an aqueous environment after finishing designated tasks and are harmless to the environment. In the latter aspect, NSNs employ cross-scale interfaces to interconnect the in vivo environment and its external environment. Specifically, the in-messaging and out-messaging interfaces for nanorobots to interact with a macro-unit are defined. The propagation and transient characteristics of nanorobots are described based on the existing experimental results. Furthermore, planning of nanorobot paths is discussed by taking into account the effectiveness of region-of-interest detection and the period of surveillance. Finally, a case study on how NSNs may be applied to microwave breast cancer detection is presented.		Yifan Chen;Tadashi Nakano;Panagiotis Kosmas;Chau Yuen;Athanasios V.

Plastic plates are often used in consumer products. The tactile evaluation plays an important role in product development. However, physical quantities not taking into account human tactile perception have been employed in previous tactile estimation procedures. Hence, in this study, we adopted the vibrational thresholds of the mechanoreceptive units-FA I, FA II, SA I and SA II-for stimuli detection and developed a tactile estimation method for plastic plates that clarified the mechanoreceptive units related to tactile sensation. The developed tactile sensor consists of a base and a silicone rubber pad that contains strain gauges in it. We detected vibration during touch by the sensor and calculated the estimation of the firing values of the cutaneous mechanoreceptors, which are the essential data obtained by humans during tactile perception, in comparison to the amplitude spectrum of the vibration with the threshold amplitude of each mechanoreceptive unit. Simultaneously, we calculated the relationship between the normal and tangential forces recorded while the sensor ran over the samples. As a result of stepwise linear regression analysis using these values as explanatory variables, the evaluation scores for Soft were successfully estimated using the firing value of FA II and the relationship between normal/tangential forces, and the evaluation scores for Rough were estimated using the SA I firing value.	approximation algorithm;clarify;conflict (psychology);emoticon;entity name part qualifier - adopted;evaluation;experiment;extraction;mechanoreceptors;new product development;pc²;photoelectric effect;pivot table;principal component analysis;proprotein convertase 2;quantity;regression analysis;rough set;silicone elastomers;silicones;spectral density;stepwise regression;sticky bit;sulfanilamide;tactile sensor;touch perception;unit;explanation	Lisako Nobuyama;Yuta Kurashina;Kei Kawauchi;Koji Matsui;Kenjiro Takemura	2018		10.3390/s18051588	electronic engineering;strain gauge;impulse (physics);engineering;sensation;control theory;perception;amplitude;frequency spectrum;tactile sensor;vibration	Robotics	88.20276058504665	-21.038837880432936	79557

b8c8b2e7f51f7072999475819b9fdf8792dbfc9d	numerical simulation of artificial microswimmers driven by marangoni flow		In the present paper the behavior of a single artificial microswimmer is addressed, namely an active droplet moving by Marangoni flow. The non-uniform surface tension distribution underlying the propulsion mechanism of the droplet, is generated by a non-uniform distribution of surfactant on its surface. We provide a numerical treatment for the main factors playing a role in real systems, such as advection, diffusion and the presence of chemical species with different behaviors. The flow field inside and outside the droplet is derived, thus accounting for the two-way coupling between the surrounding fluid and the motion of the swimmer. Mass diffusion is also taken into account. In particular, we consider two concentration fields: the surfactant concentration in the bulk, i.e. in the liquid surrounding the droplet, and the surfactant concentration on the surface. The latter is related to the local surface tension, through an equation of state (Langmuir equation). We examine different interaction mechanisms between the bulk and the surface concentration fields, namely the case of insoluble surfactants attached to the surface (no exchange between the bulk and the surface) and soluble surfactants with adsorption/desorption at the surface. We also consider the case where the bulk concentration field is in equilibrium with the content of the droplet. The numerical results are validated through comparison with analytical calculations. We show that our model can reproduce the typical pusher/puller behavior presented by squirmers. It is also able to capture the self-propulsion mechanism of droplets driven by Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reactions, as well as a typical chemotactic behavior.	computer simulation	L. Stricker	2017	J.

In this paper, the benefits of using a multispectral-based infrared sensor over the diurnal cycle have been shown. Firstly, a brief theoretical analysis on how the thermal crossover influences a conventional thermal sensor, within the conditions where the thermal crossover would happen and why the mid-infrared (3~5 μm) multispectral technology is effective, is presented. Furthermore, the effectiveness of this technology is also described and we describe how the prototype design and multispectral technology is employed to help solve the thermal crossover detection problem. Thirdly, several targets are set up outside and imaged in the field experiment over a 24-h period. The experimental results show that the multispectral infrared imaging system can enhance the contrast of the detected images and effectively solve the failure of the conventional infrared sensor during the diurnal cycle, which is of great significance for infrared surveillance applications.	antivirus software;bands;crossover (genetic algorithm);image fusion;multispectral image;navier–stokes equations;numerous;physical object;polarization (waves);polarizer;population parameter;preparation;prototype;pseudo brand of pseudoephedrine;religious missions;steel;stokes parameters;systems design;benefit;sensor (device);wavelength	Huijie Zhao;Zheng Ji;Na Li;Jianrong Gu;Yansong Li	2016		10.3390/s17010056	multispectral image;diurnal cycle;analytical chemistry;optics;remote sensing	HCI	92.34866354940078	-20.86738796562092	79862

The first type of solutions exhibits finite time singularity in the sense of wave-breaking. We perform a refined analysis based on the local structure of the dynamics to provide some criteria that leads to the blow-up of solutions. The other type of solutions we study is the solitary waves. We classify various localized solitary wave solutions for the R2CH system. In addition to those smooth solitary wave solutions, we show that there are solitary waves with singularities, like peakons and cuspons, depending on the values of the rotating parameter Ω and the balance index σ. We also prove that horizontally symmetric weak solutions of this model must be traveling waves.	soliton;spiral wave	Robin Ming Chen;Lili Fan;Hongjun Gao;Yue Liu	2017	SIAM J. Math.

As the bonding temperature decreased, the composite properties of ACF, such as water absorption, glass transition temperature (Tg), elastic modulus (E 0) and coefficient of thermal expansion (a), were improved. These results were due to the difference in network structures of cured ACFs which were fully cured at different temperatures. From small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) test result, ACFs cured at lower temperature, had denser network structures. The reliability performances of flip chip on organic substrate assemblies using ACFs were also investigated as a function of bonding temperatures. The results in thermal cycling test ( 55 C/+150 C, 1000 cycles) and PCT (121 C, 100% RH, 96 h) showed that the lower bonding temperature resulted in better reliability of the flip chip interconnects using ACFs. Therefore, the composite properties of cured ACF and reliability of flip chip on organic substrate assemblies using ACFs were strongly affected by the bonding temperature. 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We have used a sol–gel spin-coating process to fabricate a new metal–insulator–metal capacitor comprising 10-nm thick binary hafnium–zirconium–oxide (HfxZr1 xO2) film on a flexible polyimide (PI) substrate. The surface morphology of this HfxZr1 xO2 film was investigated using atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, which confirmed that continuous and crack-free film growth had occurred on the PI. After oxygen plasma pre-treatment and subsequent annealing at 250 C, the film on the PI substrate exhibited a low leakage current density of 3.22 10 8 A/cm at 10 V and maximum capacitance densities of 10.36 fF/lm at 10 kHz and 9.42 fF/lm at 1 MHz. The as-deposited sol–gel film was oxidized when employing oxygen plasma at a relatively low temperature ( 250 C), thereby enhancing the electrical performance. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

2652c58bd91dc68a7be05c4aa34a78eef9ada950	methods for increased energy and flux in high harmonic generation	qa75 electronic computers computer science	High harmonic generation (HHG) is a nonlinear light matter interaction that results in the generation of high order harmonics of a driving optical field. It is routinely used to generate coherent short wavelength radiation in the soft x-ray and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) regimes. HHG-based XUV sources require a highly intense driving pulse to be focused into a target gas typically within a gas cell, gas jet or hollow capillary. They can be used for a variety of applications, one of which is nanoscale imaging. The work presented in this thesis focuses on the development of two high flux HHG sources for use in tabletop nanoscale imaging; a capillary based HHG system using a Ti:Sapphire based laser and a gas cell based HHG system using an Yb-doped fibre laser.  The manufacture and use of a 7 cm hollow core capillary in HHG is described. The propagation of the pump pulse is modelled using a new nonlinear propagation model and compared to experimental results. The pulse is found to undergo pulse self-compression using a new regime of high ionisation pulse compression. The pulse is observed to reduce in length from 53 fs to 28 fs, with post compression reducing this further to 15 fs. The XUV spectrum from the 7 cm capillary is measured and its dependence on gas pressure discussed using calculations of the XUV transmission within the capillary. Using the observations made of the 7 cm capillary a new more efficient 4.5 cm capillary is designed and manufactured. Comparison between the two capillaries shows an increase in flux of the new capillary design of more than an order of magnitude, with a calculated value of 5.3x10^12 ph harm^-1 s^-1 cm^-2, one of the highest in the world.  A gas cell is used in the Yb-doped fibre laser based HHG source and the XUV signal is measured using an XUV photodiode. The XUV signal is characterised by measuring its dependence on focal position, gas pressure and pump laser power. A novel method of increasing the flux by twisting of a second lens outside the vacuum chamber is discovered and was found to double the measured signal. The maximum flux for this fibre laser based HHG source is calculated and found to be 2.2x10^12 ph s^-1, the highest measured for a fibre based HHG source.		Thomas J.

8eb0d9d1156d3b380cb08560dd5893433e46a374	learning probabilistic models of hydrogen bond stability from molecular dynamics simulation trajectories	regression tree;molecular dynamics;machine learning	Hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) play a key role in both the formation and stabilization of protein structures. H-bonds involving atoms from residues that are close to each other in the main-chain sequence stabilize secondary structure elements. H-bonds between atoms from distant residues stabilize a protein’s tertiary structure. However, H-bonds greatly vary in stability. They form and break while a protein deforms. For instance, the transition of a protein from a non-functional to a functional state may require some H-bonds to break and others to form. The intrinsic strength of an individual H-bond has been studied from an energetic viewpoint, but energy alone may not be a very good predictor. Other local interactions may reinforce (or weaken) an H-bond. This paper describes inductive learning methods to train a protein-independent probabilistic model of H-bond stability from molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories. The training data describes H-bond occurrences at successive times along these trajectories by the values of attributes called predictors. A trained model is constructed in the form of a regression tree in which each non-leaf node is a Boolean test (split) on a predictor. Each occurrence of an H-bond maps to a path in this tree from the root to a leaf node. Its predicted stability is associated with the leaf node. Experimental results demonstrate that such models can predict H-bond stability quite well. In particular, their performance is roughly 20% better than that of models based on H-bond energy alone. In addition, they can accurately identify a large fraction of the least stable H-bonds in a given conformation. The paper discusses several extensions that may yield further improvements.	hydrogen;molecular dynamics;simulation	Igor Chikalov;Peggy Yao;Mikhail Ju.

The SOI-based pressure microsensor consists of a pressure-sensitive diaphragm at the handle layer and two lateral resonators (electrostatic excitation and capacitive detection) on the device layer as a differential setup. The resonators were vacuum packaged with a glass cap using anodic bonding and the wire interconnection was realized using a mask-free electrochemical etching approach by selectively patterning an Au film on highly topographic surfaces. The fabricated resonant pressure microsensor with dual resonators was characterized in a systematic manner, producing a quality factor higher than 10,000 (~6 months), a sensitivity of about 166 Hz/kPa and a reduced nonlinear error of 0.033% F.S. Based on the differential output, the sensitivity was increased to two times and the temperature-caused frequency drift was decreased to 25%.	anodic bonding;diaphragm (acoustics);dual;excitation;f factor;frequency drift;gold;hertz (hz);interconnection;kilopascal;known-plaintext attack;lateral thinking;nonlinear system;oral wafer;preparation;pyschological bonding;sensor;silicon on insulator;topography;twice (numerical qualifier);wafer (electronics)	Bo Xie;Yonghao Xing;Yanshuang Wang;Jianchu Chen;Deyong Chen;Junbo Wang	2015		10.3390/s150924257	electronic engineering;chemistry;anodic bonding;electrical engineering;analytical chemistry;vacuum packing;nanotechnology	HCI	91.19882111554683	-16.99995041739717	80460

This flexibility causes the electron density to change, which leads to fluctuating atomic multipole moments. Quantum Chemical Topology (QCT) allows for the partitioning of an """"atom in a molecule,"""" thus localizing electron density to finite atomic domains, which permits the unambiguous evaluation of atomic multipole moments. By selecting an ensemble of physically realistic conformers of a chemical system, one evaluates the various multipole moments at defined points in configuration space. The subsequent implementation of the machine learning method kriging delivers the evaluation of an analytical function, which smoothly interpolates between these points. This allows for the prediction of atomic multipole moments at new points in conformational space, not trained for but within prediction range. In this work, we demonstrate that the carbohydrates erythrose and threose are amenable to the above methodology. We investigate how kriging models respond when the training ensemble incorporating multiple energy minima and their environment in conformational space. Additionally, we evaluate the gains in predictive capacity of our models as the size of the training ensemble increases. We believe this approach to be entirely novel within the field of carbohydrates. For a modest training set size of 600, more than 90% of the external test configurations have an error in the total (predicted) electrostatic energy (relative to ab initio) of maximum 1 kJ mol(-1) for open chains and just over 90% an error of maximum 4 kJ mol(-1) for rings."""	anatomy, regional;atom;carbohydrate nutrients;carbohydrates:prid:pt:urine:nom;computational chemistry;d-threose;electrostatics;greater than;interpolation;kriging;license;machine learning;maxima and minima;quantitative computed tomography;quantum;ring device;scanning electron microscopy;smoothing;test set;kilojoule (kj)	Salvatore Cardamone;Paul L.

The zero-bias barrier height (ϕϕBo) and ideality factor (n) assuming the thermionic emission (TE) mechanism show strong temperature dependence. While n   decreases, ϕϕBo   increases with increasing temperature. Such temperature dependence of ϕϕBo is an obvious disagreement with the reported negative temperature coefficient (αtemp) of barrier height. Therefore, we have reported a modification which includes the n and electron-tunneling parameter (αχ1/2δ) in the expression of reverse-saturation current (I0). After this modification, the value of αtemp obtained as −4 × 10−4 eV/K which is very close to αtemp of GaAs band-gap (−5.4 × 10−4 eV/K). Richardson plot of the ln(I0/T2) versus 1/T has two linear region; the first region is (200–400 K) and the second region (80–150 K). The values of the activation energy (Ea) and Richardson constant were obtained from this plot and the values of Ea and Richardson constants (A*) are much lower than the known values. These behaviors of the Au/SiO2/n-GaAs (MIS) type (SBDs) have been interpreted by the assumption of a double-Gaussian distribution of barrier heights (BHs) at the metal–semiconductor interface giving a mean BHs (ϕ¯Bo) of 1.20 and 0.68 eV and standard deviation (σs) of 0.1503 and 0.0755 V, respectively. Thus the modified ln (I0/T2)-q2σs2/2k2T2 versus q/kT for two different temperature ranges (200–400 K and 80–150 K) plot then gives mean barrier heights ϕ¯Bo and A*, 1.18 and 0.66 eV and 7.08 and 3.81 A/cm2 K2, respectively. This value of the A* 7.08 A/cm2 K2 is very close to the theoretical value of 8.16 A/cm2 K2 for n-type GaAs. Hence, all these behaviours of the forward-bias I–V characteristics of the Au/SiO2/n-GaAs (MIS) type SBDs can be successfully explained on the basis of a TE mechanism with a double-Gaussian distribution of the BHs.

Scientific analysis is important for the conservation of art, as it can help to reveal the history of a work and to determine the proper materials for its restoration. Mid-infrared spectroscopy and X-ray analysis are currently used to identify organic and inorganic materials, respectively. Terahertz spectroscopy is expected to identify composites themselves, and to give clear and direct information for art conservation. We have collected terahertz spectra of various historical and modern materials, and found that terahertz spectroscopy can distinguish the pigments, binders and their mixtures. The experimental results prove that terahertz spectroscopy as a new non-invasive examination method can contribute to art history and to restorations. The material database can also contribute to other fields such as earth science, the printing industry, and the food and pharmaceutical research fields.	circuit restoration;printing;rca spectra 70	Kaori Fukunaga;Yuichi Ogawa;Shin'ichiro Hayashi;Iwao Hosako	2007	IEICE Electronic Express	10.1587/elex.4.258	terahertz radiation;nanotechnology;optics;terahertz spectroscopy and technology;physics	AI	96.27110846465582	-22.236041612052894	80913

These shapes can be used as the mechanical bodies of robots. The input to this process is a 3D geometry (e.g. an OBJ file). The output is a physical object with the specified geometry. We describe an algorithm pipeline that (1) identifies the overall geometry of the input, (2) computes a crease pattern that causes the sheet to self-fold into the desired 3D geometry when activated by uniform heating, (3) automatically generates the design of a 2D sheet with the desired pattern and (4) automatically generates the design files required to fabricate the 2D structure. We demonstrate these algorithms by applying them to complex 3D shapes. We demonstrate the fabrication of a self-folding object with over 50 faces from automatically generated design files.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);correctness (computer science);end-to-end principle;experiment;front and back ends;mathematical optimization;record sealing;robot;simulation;symmetric multiprocessing;tolley (company);unfolding (dsp implementation);wavefront .obj file	Byoungkwon An;Shuhei Miyashita;Michael T.

This model can describe gas/liquid interface in high refinement, which is better than the original VOF methodology. To validate the proposed model and the algorithm, the computational code is employed to predict the flow performance in a cylindrical swirl injector under cold-flow condition, and the predicted results agree well with experimental measurements. Furthermore, the proposed model is used to simulate gas-liquid reacting flows inside a gas/liquid coaxial swirl injector operating in a hot environment. The turbulent combustion process is simulated with the k-@e-f-g model. The numerical simulation is carried out under actual operating condition of the coaxial injector. The injector performances, such as liquid film thickness, liquid film injection velocity, spray angle, pressure drop, are obtained based on the detailed information of the internal flow field. The predicted results also show that droplets are shed from the liquid film in the recess cup of the coaxial injector because of the large velocity gradient between the gas and liquid streams, and a burning area, which is characterized by high temperature, is present inside the injector.	computer simulation;hybrid fibre-coaxial	Huiqiang Zhang;Lixin Zhou;C.

bc762f90d987e36786d4e72e96d5c4f04adeac79	dielectric charging phenomena in diamond films used in rf mems capacitive switches: the effect of film thickness		Article history: Received 28 June 2016 Accepted 7 July 2016 The present paper aims to provide a better insight to the dielectric charging phenomena of nano-crystalline diamond (NCD) films that are used in RFMEMS capacitive switches. The electrical properties of NCD films of various thicknesses are investigated with the aid of metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors. The dominant conduction mechanisms have been identified by obtaining current-voltage characteristics in the temperature range from 300 K to 400 K and dielectric charging phenomena have been investigated by using thermally stimulated depolarization currents (TSDC) technique. The experimental results indicate a thermally activated conductivity for low electric field intensities while Hill-type conduction takes place for field intensities N130 kV/cm. The conductivity as well as the defect density seems to increase with film thickness. Enhanced dielectric charging phenomena have been observed on thicker films and the injected charges are found to be trapped through the material's volume. These results indicate that thinner NCD films seem to be more promising for RF MEMS capacitive switches. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The reeds of the invention are closed at their tops instead of being open as was common in conventional practice, and the reeds have an array of circumferential perforations near their closed tops for venting off gases and vapors which evolve from said liquid, while tangential perforations extend through the peripheral surface of the reeds in intermediate sections thereof. The pressure drop of gases and vapors can be adjusted within a wide range and corrosion in the top portion of the tubes is very efficiently prevented.	inverse transform sampling;nonlinear system;tomography	Aria Abubakar;Tarek M.

In a previous paper, we already showed results for the gravitino decaying into two and three particles. In this paper, we incorporate the processes where an unstable neutralino, stau or stop decays into a gravitino and Standard Model particles. This is the case in gravitino dark matter supersymmetric models, where the gravitino is the lightest SUSY particle. We give instructions for the installation and the use of the package. In the numerical analysis, we discuss various MSSM scenarios. We show that the calculation of all the decay channels and the three-body decay branching ratios is essential for the accurate application of cosmological bounds on these models.#R##N#Program summary#R##N#Program title: GravitinoPack#R##N##R##N#Catalogue identifier: AEZL_v1_0#R##N##R##N#Program summary URL:http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEZL_v1_0.html#R##N##R##N#Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen’s University, Belfast, N.

The gravitino, the spin 3/2 superpartner of the graviton, belongs to the spectrum of the most important supersymmetric models. The gravitino can be the Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP), in the so-called gravitino Dark Matter (DM) models. Thus, the Next to the Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (NLSP) is long-lived, since it decays gravitationally to the LSP (gravitino) and SM particles. Such decays produce electromagnetic energy and hadrons which can affect the primordial Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) predictions for the abundance of the light nuclei. Similarly, when the gravitino is not the LSP it decays into the LSP which can be another SUSY particle, like the neutralino, and SM particles. GravitinoPack provides important results on all these decays, making the application of the BBN data more accurate.#R##N##R##N#Solution method: GravitinoPack is a package for the evaluation of processes with gravitino interaction. The version GravitinoPack1.0 includes all two-body decays of the gravitino and all three-body decays of the gravitino to a neutralino and a pair of two particles. In the case that the gravitino is the LSP all two- and three-body decays of the lightest neutralino, the light stop or stau NLSP are included. GravitinoPack works at Fortran77 level and has a Mathematica interface.#R##N##R##N#Unusual features: MathLink works properly only up to version Mathematica 9. There is still a conflict between Mathematica 10 and the used integration routine CUBA.#R##N##R##N#Running time: All two-body decay widths are calculated in a time far below one second. The three-body decay calculations can be fast, especially the stop and stau decays, or slow with times up to a few minutes, especially when the phase space becomes large and no approximation is chosen.	supersymmetric quantum mechanics	Helmut Eberl;Vassilis C.

In this article, pulse reverse voltage was applied to commercial purity (99 %) and high purity (99.997%) Al foils at room temperature to form AAO. DC method was also used as a reference. The pulse AAO method provides advantages not only the reduced process complexity and at low cost but also better uniformity than that performed by DC one. The results show that pore uniformity can be improved by pulse reverse voltage in the 3h duration anodization compared to DC method. The pulse reverse voltage presents the high uniformity (77 ~ 78 %) in both low and high purity Al. The effects on different Al purity and process durations will further discussed in this study.	acer aspire one;cmos;circuit complexity;gnu nano;pure function	C. K. Chung;Tingyun Liu;W. T.

The modified channel consists of the In0.53Ga0.47 As and the InP layers. Since InP has lower impact ionization coefficient than In0.53Ga0.47 As, we have adopted the InP-composite channel in the MHEMT. Also, the gate recess width is both functions of breakdown and RF characteristic of a HEMT structure. Therefore, we have studied the breakdown and RF characteristic for various gate recess widths of MHEMT's. We have compared breakdown characteristic of the InP-composite channel with that of conventional MHEMT's. It is shown that on and off state breakdown voltages of the InP-composite channel MHEMT were increased by about 20 and 27 %, respectively, compared with the conventional structure. Also, breakdown voltage of the InP-composite channel MHEMT was increased with increasing gate recess width. The fmax was increased with decreasing the gate recess width, whereas fmax was increased with increasing the gate recess width. Also, we extracted small-signal parameters. It was shown that Gd of the InP-composite channel MHEMT is decreased about by 30 % compared with the conventional MHEMT. Therefore, the suppression of the impact ionization in the InP-composite channel increases the breakdown voltage and decreases the output conductance.	and gate;conductance (graph);electron mobility;impact ionization;matthews correlation coefficient;metamorphic testing;radio frequency;small-signal model;transistor;zero suppression	Seok Gyu Choi;Young Hyun Baek;Jung Hun Oh;Min Han;Seok Ho Bang;Jin Koo Rhee	2008	2008 Global Symposium on Millimeter Waves	10.1093/ietele/e91-c.5.683	electronic engineering;high-electron-mobility transistor;impact ionization;breakdown voltage;electrical engineering;physics	EDA	91.80249308392618	-10.500539077986492	82219
e77c7e07a42b171abad0972ffdf21423a5c7cd27	effects of ligand environment in zr(iv) assisted peptide hydrolysis		In this DFT study, activities of 11 different N2O4, N2O3, and NO2 core containing Zr(IV) complexes, 4,13-diaza-18-crown-6 (I'N2O4), 1,4,10-trioxa-7,13-diazacyclopentadecane (I'N2O3), and 2-(2-methoxy)ethanol (I'NO2), respectively, and their analogues in peptide hydrolysis have been investigated. Based on the experimental information, these molecules were created by altering protonation states (singly protonated, doubly protonated, or doubly deprotonated) and number of their ligands. The energetics of the I'N2O4, and I'NO2 and their analogues predicted that both stepwise and concerted mechanisms occurred either with similar barriers, or the latter was more favorable than the former. They also showed that the doubly deprotonated form hydrolyzed the peptide bond with substantially lower barriers than the barriers for other protonation states. For NO2 core possessing complexes, Zr-(NO2)(OHH)(H2O/OH)n for n = 1-3, the hydroxyl group containing molecules were found to be more reactive than their water ligand possessing counterparts. The barriers for these complexes reduced with an increase in the coordination number (6-8) of the Zr(IV) ion. Among all 11 molecules, the NO2 core possessing and two hydroxyl group containing I'DNO2-2H complex was found to be the most reactive complex with a barrier of 28.9 kcal/mol. Furthermore, barriers of 27.5, 28.9, and 32.0 kcal/mol for hydrolysis of Gly-Glu (negative), Gly-Gly (neutral), and Gly-Lys (positive) substrates, respectively, by this complex were in agreement with experiments. The activities of these complexes were explained in terms of basicity of their ligand environment and nucleophilicity of the Zr(IV) center using metal-ligand distances, charge on the metal ion, and the metal-nucleophile distance as parameters. These results provide a deeper understanding of the functioning of these complexes and will help design Zr(IV)-based synthetic metallopeptidases.		Tingting Zhang;Gaurav Sharma;Thomas J.

Earlier publications of this theory had proposed that a subatomic particle should consist of an electrostatic field that has the form of a radial Turing wave pattern whose form is maintained through the ongoing activity of a nonlinear reaction-diffusion medium that fills all space. This subatomic Turing wave prediction now finds confirmation in recent nucleon scattering form factor data which show that the nucleon core has a Gaussian charge density distribution with a peripheral periodicity whose wavelength approximates the particle's Compton wavelength and which declines in amplitude with increasing radial distance. The subquantum kinetics explanation for the origin of charge correctly anticipates the observation that the proton's charge density wave pattern is positively biased while the neutron's is not. The phenomenon of beta decay is interpreted as the onset of a secondary bifurcation leading from the uncharged neutron solution to the charged proton solution. The Turing wave dissipative structure prediction is able to account in a unitary fashion for nuclear binding, particle diffraction, and electron orbital quantization. The wave packet model is shown to be fundamentally flawed implying that quantum mechanics does not realistically represent the microphysical world. This new conception points to the possible existence of orbital energy states below the Balmer ground state whose transitions may be tapped as a new source of energy.	bifurcation theory;control theory;dissipative system;electron;excite;experiment;ground state;heuristic;hydrogen;kelly criterion;kinesiology;kinetics internet protocol;molecular orbital;network packet;newton;nonlinear system;notepad2;onset (audio);peripheral;quantum field theory;quantum mechanics;quasiperiodicity;radial (radio);schrödinger;simulation;subatomic particle;systems concepts;turing;wave packet	Paul A.

A three-dimensional, incompressible, viscous, RNG turbulence model and the SIMPLE method were used by computational fluid dynamics(CFD), and the flow fields of suction cylinder-seeder with different socket’s radiuses were simulated by Fluent. When vacuum is 4kPa and productivity is 350 trays/h, the simulant results show that pressure is uniform, velocity is stable, energy loss mainly occurs near slots and outlet, and there is less interaction among socket-slots; The effect of flow field on socket’s radius to the cylinder isn’t significant by contrasting different socket’s radiuses on the average turbulent kinetic energy, the average vacuum and the maximum difference of velocity behind slots; The experimental results show that the best seeding performance is 84.73% when the socket’s radius is 5.5mm. Although the performance should be improved, but any sockets are never plugged, which shows enough that the seeder is a very promising precision seeding device.	computation;computational fluid dynamics;computer simulation;cylinder seal;cylinder-head-sector;maxdiff;turbulence kinetic energy;turbulence modeling;unix domain socket;velocity (software development)	Yanjun Zuo;Xu Ma;Long Qi;Xinglong Liao	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-18333-1_1	classical mechanics;statistical physics;turbulence modeling;k-omega turbulence model;kolmogorov microscales;k-epsilon turbulence model;direct numerical simulation;computational physics;turbulence kinetic energy	HPC	87.13523819360603	-9.678011452812223	82326

The raw belt constructed in this manner is then vulcanized by means of exposure to pressure and heat in a rotating installation. The innermost rubber cover layer in the radial direction is scorched prior to its placement on the outer cover layer and the longitudinal steel wires. An apparatus for the continuous manufacture of a conveyor belt with cover layers of rubber and with a reinforcing insert of longitudinal steel ropes has an extruder-calender arrangement (2, 4 and 3, 5, respectively) each for the production of the lower and upper cover layer (11, 12). At least one doubling installation (15, 17; 22, 23) is provided for the combining of the cover layers (11, 12). Between the extruder-calender (2, 4) producing the cover layer (11) resting on the press drum (16) during the finish vulcanizing process, and the doubling station (22, 23), a heating device (24, 26) is provided for the heating of the cover layer (11).	fault tolerance	Warren Robinett;Gregory S.

90f3ed0ee0282cefa4a7c26d68cb5e5febc6ffb6	switchable nonlinear optical properties of η5-monocyclopentadienylmetal complexes: a dft approach		Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been carried out to investigate the switching of the second-order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties of η(5)-monocyclopentadienyliron(II) and ruthenium(II) model complexes presenting 5-(3-(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c]thiophen-1-yl)thiophene-2-carbonitrile as a ligand. The switching properties were induced by redox means. Both oxidation and reduction stimulus have been considered, and calculations have been performed both for the complexes and for the free benzo[c]thiophene derivative ligand in order to elucidate the role played by the organometallic fragment on the second-order NLO properties of these complexes. B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP, and M06 functionals were used for our calculations. The results show some important structural changes upon oxidation/reduction that are accompanied by significant differences on the corresponding second-order NLO properties. TD-DFT calculations show that these differences on the second-order NLO response upon oxidation/reduction are due to a change in the charge transfer pattern, in which the organometallic iron and ruthenium moieties play an important role. The calculated static hyperpolarizabilities were found to be strongly functional dependent. CAM-B3LYP, however, seems to predict more reliable structural and optical data as well as hyperpolarizabilities when compared to experimental data. The use of this functional predicts that the studied complexes can be viewed as acting as redox second-order NLO switches, in particular using oxidation stimulus. The β(tot) value of one-electron oxidized species is at least ~8.3 times (for Ru complex) and ~5.5 times (for Fe complex) as large as that of its nonoxidized counterparts.		Paulo J. Mendes;Tiago J.

As a fast-responding PSP, polymer-ceramic (PC-)PSP is widely studied. Since PC-PSP generally consists of titanium (IV) oxide (TiO₂) particles, a large reduction in the luminescent intensity will occur due to the photocatalytic action of TiO₂. We propose the usage of polymer particles instead of TiO₂ particles to prevent the reduction in the luminescent intensity. Here, we fabricate pp-PSP based on the polystyrene particle with a diameter of 1 μm, and investigate the pressure- and temperature-sensitives, the response time, and the photostability. The performances of pp-PSP are compared with those of PC-PSP, indicating the high photostability with the other characteristics comparable to PC-PSP.	apache continuum;detoxpc;diameter (qualifier value);entity name part qualifier - adopted;intracisternal a-particle elements;particle;performance;photostability drug study;polymer;polystyrenes;polyvinyl chloride;response time (technology);simian t-lymphotropic virus-pp;small;titanium;negative regulation of type iv pilus biogenesis	Yu Matsuda;Kenta Uchida;Yasuhiro Egami;Hiroki Yamaguchi;Tomohide Niimi	2016		10.3390/s16040550	text mining;medical research;computer science;bioinformatics;engineering;nanotechnology;forensic engineering	AI	93.93780916182594	-16.37154603511469	82602

P-type Si substrates were subjected to porous Si by electrochemical etching at room temperature. One category of samples has PdO layer in its structure while the other one does not. We have used electron-beam method for Pd deposition. Results show that when electron-beam technique is used for Pd deposition, existence of PdO layer will increase the range of sensors' operation up to 1% of hydrogen concentration. These samples will be saturated after 186seconds, while the samples without this layer can detect hydrogen up to 0.6% in 150 seconds response time.	hydrogen;sensor	Samaneh Mousavi;Hasan Hajghassem;Mehdi Khajeh;Majidreza Aliahmadi	2009	IEICE Electronic Express	10.1587/elex.6.1253	hydrogen sensor	HCI	92.81614014716735	-14.894716624092217	82650

6fa9e12440f469ac73fb96344019eedfa806d47a	shear wave elastography for the characterization of arterial wall stiffness: a thin-plate phantom and ex vivo aorta study		Ultrasound shear wave elastography (SWE) is an emerging technique for characterizing local arterial stiffness - a known indicator for vascular health. However, the implications due to vascular anatomy and tissue environment are still relatively under-examined. Using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) based tissue mimicking phantoms, this study assessed the current signal processing framework in demonstrating the challenges due to the wave dispersion (at the medium thicknesses smaller than the shear wavelength) and wave interference at the interface of different media which cause biased stiffness estimations. Hence, 5% PVA and 10% PVA phantoms of varying thicknesses (from 1 to 10 mm) were imaged when placed in water and in 5% PVA and 10% PVA phantoms. Our results confirmed that shear wave propagation was thickness dependent (315% underestimation in 10% PVA). The shear wave velocity was shown to be influenced by the surrounding media with a 150% overestimation in 5% PVA surrounded by 10% PVA. It also demonstrated a key limitation of arterial SWE in that the current phase velocity estimation does not provide accurate SWV estimation, requiring optimization for addressing wave interference.	elastography;estimation of distribution algorithm;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;phantom reference;signal processing;software propagation;stiffness;thickness (graph theory);velocity (software development);video-in video-out	Enoch Jing-Han Chang;Yuexin Guo;Wei-Ning Lee	2017	2017 IEEE 14th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2017)	10.1109/ISBI.2017.7950518	artificial intelligence;computer vision;wave propagation;phase velocity;computer science;shear (sheet metal);imaging phantom;dispersion (optics);wavelength;elastography;stiffness;optics;composite material	Arch	93.52959603665143	-22.47475171559891	82725

This study performed a systematic model-based analysis of a downer-type regenerator to recover the activity of FCC catalyst by using a one-dimensional model of the regenerator coupled with its hydrodynamic characteristics and the kinetics of catalyst regeneration. The results of a sensitivity analysis showed that higher carbon content on spent catalyst causes a higher regeneration temperature. The ratio of the recycled-to-spent catalyst flow rate in range of 1.0–3.5 and temperatures of the spent catalyst in range of 703.15–803.15 K have insignificant effects on the overall performance of the regenerator. The suitable superficial gas velocity and the spent catalyst flow rate are in range of 4–7 m s −1  and 20–40 kg m −2  s −1 , respectively.	password cracking	Anon Chuachuensuk;Woranee Paengjuntuek;Soorathep Kheawhom;Amornchai Arpornwichanop	2013	Computers & Chemical Engineering	10.1016/j.compchemeng.2012.10.003	forensic engineering;chemical engineering;waste management;fluid catalytic cracking	SE	86.67003896867423	-11.360832208783775	82765

Microwave dielectric-based sensors are well suited to fulfill such needs because water is a common component of these products, and water has a strong interaction with the electric field at microwave frequencies. Recent advances in calibration methods and availability of reliable and inexpensive microwave components offer an opportunity for the development of a new generation of low-cost microwave sensors for process monitoring and control that will result in significant labor and cost savings in addition to maintaining the desired quality and complying with safety regulations. This is even more relevant in a social and economic environment where consumer awareness is high and new rules and guidelines for labeling and safety standards are put in place. This paper discusses both the development of calibration methods for indirect determination of bulk density and moisture content from measurement of the dielectric properties at a single microwave frequency and development of inexpensive microwave meters for routine characterization of grain, seed, and in-shell peanuts in static and dynamic situations. Accuracy and savings associated with the use of such devices are also covered.	content determination;list of system quality attributes;microwave;non-functional requirement;real-time clock;sensor	Samir Trabelsi;Stuart O.

Then the different bedded models were constructed and the shelf was designed to roll the filament based on the bedded model. The shielding effectiveness of these models was measured according to the standard plain material’s testing method of the shielding effectiveness. Results show that when the bedded models are different there are significant changes of the shielding effectiveness. Under the same testing condition the shielding effectiveness of the model in which the yarns were arranged at right angle and kept conducted was the best, while the model, in which the yarns were arranged in parallel, was the worst. And the arrange density of the yarns in the model influenced the shielding effectiveness significantly. It can be concluded that there is a power function between the diagonal length of the grid in the model of two contact sets of yarns arranged at right angle and the shielding effectiveness of the samples, and the shielding effectiveness decreased with the increase of the diagonal length.	biological specimen;fused filament fabrication;interlaced video;interlacing (bitmaps);plating	Ruizhou Li;Lijuan Zhang;Lixia Jia	2010	IJMIC	10.1504/IJMIC.2010.037032	structural engineering;analysis of variance;electromagnetic shielding;mathematics;regression analysis;statistics	SE	88.25832509747073	-13.352456627229378	82837

For the simulation, a generic software package that provides an interactive and graphical environment for analysis by polarised Semi-Vectorial Finite Difference (SVFD) method of all kinds of integrated optical waveguides, such as buried channel, raised strip, rib, embedded, or ridge waveguides, has been implemented and tested. In this method we have taken into account the terms due to the interface between each layer. After realisation of various single mode optical waveguides on SU-8 polymer and Spin on Glass (SOG) like straight, S-bends, Y-junctions, Mach-Zehnder (MZ) interferometers, the linear absorption coefficient of energy  α  TE–TM  of such rib waveguides have been measured and estimated, respectively, near 0.32 and 0.46 cm −1  for both optical modes TE 00  and TM 00  on Si/SiO 2 /SU-8 structures. These values yield optical losses of 1.36 and 2.01 dB/cm. Optical losses ascribed to Si/SiO 2 /SOG/SU-8 microstructures have been evaluated to 2.33 and 2.95 dB/cm for both polarisations. Hence, as a crucial step for designing polymer components devoted to microsensors applications (pressure, heat transfert), the SU-8 polymer appears as a promising candidate for integrated optics with low optical losses.	integrated circuit;polymer	Bruno Bêche;N.

Depending on the direction of its stationary heat flows, it may function as, e.g., a refrigerator or a heat transformer. These continuous heat devices can be arbitrarily complex multipartite systems, and yet, their working principle is always the same: they are made up of several elementary three-level stages operating in parallel. As a result, it is possible to devise external “black-box” testing strategies to learn about their functionality and performance regardless of any internal details. In particular, one such heat pump can be tested by coupling a two-level spin to one of its “contact transitions”. The steady state of this external probe contains information about the presence of heat leaks and internal dissipation in the device and, also, about the direction of its steady-state heat currents. Provided that the irreversibility of the heat pump is low, one can further estimate its coefficient of performance. These techniques may find applications in the emerging field of quantum thermal engineering, as they facilitate the diagnosis and design optimization of complex thermodynamic cycles.	biological system;black box;black-box testing;coefficient;cost efficiency;gnu nano;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);heat sink;mathematical optimization;mesoscopic physics;programming paradigm;quantum;resource leak;stationary process;steady state;transformer	Luis A.

This has been widely studied over the years, and interesting phenomena arise, e.g. the Marangoni effect. An even more complicated situation arises for complex fluids like crude oil, where large molecules such as asphaltenes migrate to the interface and give rise to further phenomena not seen in surfactant-contaminated systems. An example of this is the “crumpling drop” experiments, where the interface of a drop being deflated becomes non-smooth at some point. In this paper we report on the development of a multiscale method for simulating such complex liquid-liquid systems. We consider simulations where water drops covered with asphaltenes are deflated, and reproduce the crumpling observed in experiments. The method on the nanoscale is based on using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of the interface, with an accurate model for the asphaltene molecules. This enables the calculation of interfacial properties. These properties are then used in the macroscale simulation, which is performed with a two-phase incompressible flow solver using a novel hybrid level-set/ghost-fluid/immersed-boundary method for taking the complex interface behaviour into account. We validate both the nanoand macroscale methods. Results are presented from nanoand macroscale simulations which showcase some of the interesting behaviour caused by asphaltenes affecting the interface. The molecular simulations presented here are the first in the literature to obtain the correct interfacial orientation of asphaltenes. Results from the macroscale simulations present a new physical explanation of the crumpled drop phenomenon, while highlighting shortcomings in previous hypotheses.

Health monitoring of pavements is becoming more and more significant, as frequently suffering from cracks, rutting, and slippage renders them prematurely out of service. Effective and reliable sensing elements are thus in high demand to make prognosis on the mechanical properties and occurrence of damage to pavements. Therefore, in this paper, various types of functionality enhancement of industrialized optical fiber sensors for pavement monitoring are developed, with the corresponding operational principles clarified in theory and the performance double checked by basic experiments. Furthermore, a self-healing optical fiber sensing network system is adopted to accomplish full-scale monitoring of pavements. The application of optical fiber sensors assembly and self-healing network system in pavement has been carried out to validate the feasibility. It has been proved that the research in this article provides a valuable method and meaningful guidance for the integrity monitoring of civil structures, especially pavements.	checking (action);clarify;entity name part qualifier - adopted;experiment;forecast of outcome;full scale;optical fiber;rendering (computer graphics);sensor (device)	Huaping Wang;Wanqiu Liu;Jianping He;Xiaoying Xing;Dandan Cao;Xipeng Gao;Xiaowei Hao;Hongwei Cheng;Zhi Zhou	2014		10.3390/s140508829	medical research;telecommunications;bioinformatics;engineering;electrical engineering;civil engineering;nanotechnology;forensic engineering	AI	90.64491550534125	-21.671557359716765	83457

A special focus has been placed on how the important wire bonding parameters, such as bond force and power, affect the contact pressure along the wire–bond pad interface. It is shown that the contact interface had a long elliptical shape, and the maximum contact pressure occurred always at the periphery of the contact interface, which is consistent in the current 2D and 3D finite element analyses. The normalised real contact area as well as the maximum frictional energy intensity varied in a similar manner to the contact pressure, with the maximum values occurring at the periphery of contact interface, where weld is preferentially formed in practical wire bonding. A higher bond force does not result in a higher contact pressure, or higher frictional energy intensity, suggesting that a high bond force is not directly correlated to better wire bondability.	wire bonding	Yong Ding;Jang-Kyo Kim;Pin Tong	2006	Microelectronics Reliability	10.1016/j.microrel.2005.09.010	mechanical joint;structural engineering;embedded system;numerical analysis;computer science;engineering;contact area;integrated circuit;interconnection;finite element method;wire bonding;forensic engineering;contact mechanics;engineering drawing;energy intensity;physics;deformation	Robotics	90.85027511665464	-9.95122373514635	83509

But within the last few years it has developed into an essential imaging method for process control and failure analysis due to its unique features and high adaptability. Atomic force microscopy is indispensable whenever three-dimensional and quantitative surface information combined with unsurpassed resolution is needed. New electrical SPM techniques offer previously inaccessible insights into the nanoscopic construction of semiconductors. They provide for the first time two-dimensional maps of various physical parameters like oxide thickness, doping, temperature or current at sub-micron to nanometer resolution. By this SPM greatly enhances the possibilities of FA to find faults and control processes.	failure analysis;semiconductor	Bernd Ebersberger;Alexander Olbrich;Christian Boit	2001	Microelectronics Reliability	10.1016/S0026-2714(01)00109-3	three-dimensional space;failure analysis;atomic force microscopy;scanning ion-conductance microscopy;scanning probe microscopy;scanning gate microscopy;scanning capacitance microscopy;engineering;analytical chemistry;conductive atomic force microscopy;scanning voltage microscopy;process control;nanotechnology;forensic engineering;physics	EDA	93.67903764722045	-14.625795578591154	83655

Two different configurations with varying pitch, 3 and 1.5 mm, and a constant height 3 mm, had been considered. Results depict the development of mushroom-like counterrotating vortices accompanied by symmetrically distributed small-scale co-rotating vortices and subsequent breakdown of the structures. Though the variation of pitch indicates similar flow structures, the point of breakdown of the structures was found to vary significantly. The probable reasons for the breakdown of the structures have also been discussed.	data structure;pitch (music);velocity (software development);vortex	T. Nadesan;Hatsari Mitsudharmadi;T. S. Lee;S. H.

c2b820679a0842bddd7d817a85e21aca3ecac227	field emission from organic materials	electrical engineering and computer science;thesis	Field emission displays (FEDs) show great promise as high performance flat panel displays. The light emission process is efficient, long lifetimes are possible with high brightness, and bright passive matrix displays can be built. Because passive matrix displays don’t need a transistor backplane, it was once thought that these displays would be cheaper to fabricate than their competitors. It is now clear that this is not the case. Fabricating a transistor backplane has turned out to be less expensive than micromachining an array of uniform field emitter tips with aligned gates. Competing technologies which use an active backplane (such as active matrix liquid crystal panels) have become ubiquitous, and FED technologies developed to date have been too expensive for the consumer market. This thesis presents a new strategy for creating a low-cost field emission display. This strategy begins by creating a field emitter out of organic conductors–a class of materials mostly neglected to date for this application. The organic emitter is made by copying a non-lithographic template. The process takes 5 minutes, occurs at room temperature and at atmospheric pressure, and does not damage the template. We show that organic conductors are easy to pattern into regular patterns and can form structures which exhibit field emission, with field enhancement factors of about 100-600 times. The field emission follows a Fowler-Nordheim characteristic. Also explored are some of the properties of organic conductors in vacuum such as conductivity over time, the interaction of the organic field emitter with background gases, and the conduction mechanism. In particular, we show that oxygen degrades the emission properties of organic field emission tips, and that organic materials retain sufficient conductivity in vacuum to serve as field emitters. The second prong of the strategy is to combine the field emitter with an inexpensive transistor. A thin-film transistor made using an organic semiconductor is used to control the emission from the field emitter. We demonstrate a circuit architecture which allows the transistor to control the field emitter without creating a micromachined gate. This architecture uses only one high voltage supply for the panel to extract and accelerate electrons toward the phosphor screen. We show that the field emitter current can be controlled over a range of about 1000:1 using only 30V. This 3 is verified through measurements of spot brightness on a phosphor screen. We then show that using the transistor has additional advantages. The current noise is reduced by a factor of 20, and DC current degradation is eliminated for oxygen partial pressures up to 1× 10−6 torr. A new linearized analysis is presented which explains the DC current control and noise reduction, and also estimates the work function fluctuation on the emitter tip. The experimental results are examined in the context of this analytical framework. The work in this thesis shows (1) that a field emitter can be made from an organic conductor using a simple process (2) a field emission display can be controlled without making an array of micromachined gates and (3) using a transistor has a number of advantages in addition to controlling the field emitter. This architecture provides a possible platform for an advanced inexpensive field emission system. Thesis Supervisor: Akintunde I.

Numerical investigations have been carried out of supersonic MHD flow of weakly ionized nitrogen plasma around model bodies (spherically blunted cylinder, truncated cylinder, and cone-cylinder lay-outs) at conditions of experiments on the Big Shock Tube (BST) of the Ioffe Institute of Russian Academy of Sciences. The purpose of the investigations was verification of a mathematical model and algorithm as well as analysis of predominant factors determining the MHD impact on the flow structure and thermal load on the model. The effect of the magnetic field induced by the coil installed in the model on the plasma flow was investigated and the efficiency of the MHD interaction was estimated. To enhance the efficiency of the MHD interaction a surface electric discharge was arranged between an electrode installed on the model nose and a ring coaxial electrode installed in the vicinity of the cone-cylinder conjugation. In the magnetic field induced by the coil the discharge rotates producing a domain of high plasma electric conductivity near the cone surface. Comparison of the predictions with experimental data obtained on the BST was presented. Thus the considered system is typical muliphysics and multiscale one involving interaction of supersonic flow with the electromagnetic field, description of large eddies evolution, turbulence model for subgrid scale, and effects of localized electric discharge. Investigations showed that at conditions under study the predominant factors of MHD impact on weakly ionized plasma flow around the body determining the flow structure are both the ponderomotive force and the Joule heating.	academy;algorithm;computer simulation;cylinder seal;cylinder-head-sector;discharger;emoticon;experiment;joule;mathematical model;numerical analysis;numerical method;plasma active;quaternions and spatial rotation;stationary process;turbulence modeling	Sergey V.

Individuals are diploid, that is, each cell contains two sets of chromosomes, and distylous, that is, two alleles, A and a, can be found at the considered locus S. Pollen and ovules of flowers with the same genotype at locus S cannot mate. This prevents the pollen of a given flower from fecundating its own stigmata. Only genotypes AA and Aa can be maintained in the population, so that the latter can be described by a random walk in the positive quadrant whose components are the number of individuals of each genotype. This random walk is not homogeneous, and its transitions depend on the location of the process. We are interested in the computation of the extinction probabilities, as extinction happens when one of the axes is reached by the process. These extinction probabilities, which depend on the initial condition, satisfy a doubly indexed recurrence equation that cannot be solved directly. Our contribution is twofold: on the one hand, we obtain an explicit, though intricate, solution through the study of the PDE solved by the associated generating function. On the other hand, we provide numerical results comparing stochastic and deterministic approximations of the extinction probabilities.	approximation;computation;initial condition;locus;numerical analysis;pollen;recurrence relation	Pauline Lafitte-Godillon;Kilian Raschel;Viet-Chi Tran	2013	SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics	10.1137/120864258	convection–diffusion equation;method of characteristics;thermodynamics;physics	Theory	85.571297205639	2.411445176531358	84246

We have proposed and demonstrated a vertically coupled microring resonator as an Add/Drop filter, and recently realized a hitless wavelength channel selective switch (hitless tunable Add/Drop filter) using Thermo-Optic (TO) effect of double series coupled dielectric microring resonator. Using a high-index dielectric material as the core, the response time was reduced to 105 μs (rise time) and 15 μs (fall time), which are fifteen-fold and hundred-fold faster than that of polymer material, and the reproducibility by the heat cycle test was also improved to less than 0.01 nm. The tuning range of wavelength selective switch was expanded to 13.3 nm using the Vernier effect, and a large extinction ratio of more than 20 dB was realized. In this review, the principle and recent progress of microring resonator based wavelength selective switch will be introduced and some basic switching circuits required to optical cross connect will be discussed. key words: high index contrast, microring resonator, wavelength selective switch, thermo-optic effect, Vernier effect, optical cross connect	arrayed waveguide grating;conley–zehnder theorem;digital cross connect system;fall time;optical cross-connect;optical fiber;polymer;radius;response time (technology);rise time	Yasuo Kokubun	2007	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietele/e90-c.5.1037	waveguide;waveguide;rise time;mach–zehnder interferometer;electronic engineering;series and parallel circuits;polymer;telecommunications;engineering;reproducibility;optics;optical switch;physics;circuit switching;optical cross-connect;dielectric	Vision	92.54738749199456	-10.594892104157791	84457

When the spring means is biased against said solid section, this front structure can be selectively moved to or maintained at any intermediate site of travel.	floorplan (microelectronics);very-large-scale integration	Chia-Pin R.

2fcbf7c3d21bd994bb7025b1a2894f8fdae7455e	an extension of a temperature modeling tool hotspot 6.0 for castle-of-chips stacking		HotSpot is an open source analysis tool for estimating temperature of both 2D and 3D chip stacks. It counts both the primary path of the heat transfer through the heat-sink and the secondary path through the print circuit board. It can estimate the temperature of chips. However, HotSpot-6.0 cannot treat a complicated chip stacking such as the castle of chips (CoC) with inductive wireless coupling through-chip interface (TCI). Therefore, in this report we have extended the HotSpot simulator and updated it in order to evaluate CoC. Compared to the original HotSpot, the extended version of HotSpot had an average execution time increase of about 6% when evaluating the same vertical stacking. The execution time of CoC with the same number of chips is shorter than when executing vertical stacking, but when the number of layers is the same, the execution time is almost equal. Moreover, our design considers high productivity, e.g. it can easily set air cooling, oil cooling, water cooling evaluation and chip rotation setting.

This aperture is proportional to the turbulence-induced coherence length and inversely proportional to the turbulence-induced spread of the wave energy in the transverse wavevectors. The effect of the turbulent medium is important when the turbulence-induced entrance aperture is smaller than the actual entrance aperture. We also study time reversal of the wave field in a turbulent medium and introduce the notion of a turbulence-induced time-reversal aperture which we show is proportional to the turbulence-induced spread in the transmitted wave energy. When the effect of the turbulent medium is important, the turbulence-induced time-reversal aperture corresponds to a time-reversal resolution much better than the resolution in the absence of the turbulent medium. The propagation and spreading of a wave field can be related to time reversal and refocusing of the wave field by a general duality relation, and we present this duality in terms of the uncertainty principle.	approximation;software propagation;t-symmetry;time reversal signal processing;transverse wave;turbulence;uncertainty principle;white noise;wigner quasiprobability distribution	Albert Fannjiang;Knut Sølna	2005	Multiscale Modeling & Simulation	10.1137/030601594	classical mechanics;white noise;optics;physics;quantum mechanics;statistics	Visualization	87.89573047932508	2.575881675606021	84795

The principle of UMC finishing is studied and experimental set-up is developed based on the foregoing study. Experiments are carried out to verify the mechanics of UMC finishing. The results show that the surface roughness of the polished optical glass by UMC finishing is on nano-scale, which can satisfy the optical surface quality requirement. Furthermore, UMC finishing can also have higher machining efficiency than magnetorheological finishing under the same experiment conditions.		F. H. Zhang;H. J. Wang;D. R.

33f5bddb840496dd43846394c2b47708040e0860	homogenization of reaction-diffusion processes in a two-component porous medium with nonlinear flux conditions at the interface	35k61;homogenization;nonlinear reaction diffusion equations;35k57;80m40;weak and strong two scale convergence;kinetics for multisubstrate enzymatic reactions;80m35;nonlinear transmission conditions	In this paper, we are dealing with the mathematical modeling and homogenization of nonlinear reaction-diffusion processes in a porous medium that consists of two components separated by an interface. One of the components is connected, and the other one is disconnected and consists of periodically distributed inclusions. At the interface, the fluxes are given by nonlinear functions of the concentrations on both sides of the interface. Thus, the concentrations may be discontinuous across the interface. For the derivation of the effective (homogenized) model, we use the method of two-scale convergence. To prove the convergence of the nonlinear terms, especially those defined on the microscopic interface, we give a new approach which involves the boundary unfolding operator and a compactness result for Banach-space-valued functions. The model is motivated by metabolic and regulatory processes in cells, where biochemical species are exchanged between organelles and cytoplasm through the organellar membranes. In this context the nonlinearities are given by kinetics corresponding to multispecies enzyme catalyzed reactions, which are generalizations of the classical Michaelis–Menten kinetics to multispecies reactions.	kinetics internet protocol;mathematical model;nonlinear system;rate of convergence;unfolding (dsp implementation)	Markus Gahn;Maria Neuss-Radu;Peter Knabner	2016	SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics	10.1137/15M1018484	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;homogenization;calculus;mathematics	Logic	85.84166857108616	2.3230841043754635	84963
22daa78f2c622e375c22848464da8946f44f9694	a multiscale-linking algorithm for the simulation of irreversible deposition	monolayer;irreversible deposition;82c24;random sequential adsorption;blocking function;brownian dynamics;ballistic deposition;multiscale;60j60;colloidal;82c31	A multiscale-linking algorithm has been developed for the efficient simulation of irreversible deposition of particles on a two-dimensional substrate. The algorithm combines Brownian dynamics simulation (BDS) for the evaluation of particle trajectories with the solution of the continuum-level conservation law for particle concentration. This allows for the use of a simulation box with relatively small dimensions in the flux direction, resulting in significant CPU-time savings. The instantaneous flux of particles into the box is computed from the solution of the transient diffusion equation with an adaptive Neumann boundary condition. The incoming particles are placed in the box in accordance with the probability distribution function associated with the motion of particles. The algorithm is applied for the simulation of irreversible monolayer deposition of noninteracting hard spheres. Results are presented for the kinetics (fractional surface coverage, θ) and the surface structure (radial distribution function, g(r), two-point probability distribution function, S2(r), and void distribution function, Hv(r)) of the deposit for different bulk concentrations, φ. Short-time kinetics follows θ(t̄) = 3 2π1/2 φ √ t̄, where t̄ denotes dimensionless time, consistent with the diffusion-limited deposition model. The approach to the maximum coverage (jamming limit), θ∞, fits a 2/3-power law, θ∞ − θ = βt̄−2/3, consistent with theoretical predictions. By performing BDS for different φ values it is shown that β = 3 4 φ−0.9 in the dilute regime. θ∞, g(r) and S2(r) are in good agreement with statistical-geometric models such as random sequential adsorption (RSA) and ballistic deposition (BD) models. However, differences exist between the predictions of BDS and RSA or BD for the blocking function, Φ, that accounts for the reduction in the particle flux at the surface due to adsorption. Specifically, ΦRSA < ΦBDS < ΦBD.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;bds c;blocking (computing);blu-ray;central processing unit;chemical vapor deposition;command & conquer:yuri's revenge;computation;fits;fused filament fabrication;higher-order function;kinetics internet protocol;nl (complexity);numerical aperture;operational amplifier;physical vapor deposition;radial (radio);radio jamming;simulation;statistical model;the void (virtual reality);thinking outside the box;time complexity;triune continuum paradigm	Rahul V.

In this study, segregation of particles due to the difference in size is simulated using Cellular Automata. A connected lattice automaton is introduced in the model, so that the variation of particle sizes as well as geometrical arrangement between particles can be represented. The Cellular Automata model can produce various characteristics which are observed in the actual granular systems. Furthermore, it is known from both numerical and experimental observations that the segregation progress is dependent on the amplitude of excitation as well as the particle size ratio.	cellular automaton	Toshihiko Komatsuzaki;Yoshio Iwata	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-15979-4_6	cellular automaton;combinatorics;simulation;computer science;mathematics;particle size;algorithm	Theory	91.10989784121696	-5.935875699959821	84974

The hole accumulation and trapping into the edge region under negative bias stress and illumination have been found to be the cause of the hump occurrence. The effects of the quantity of the hole trapped charges and the edge region length on the hump occurrence have been discussed. From the device simulation, the optimized device design parameters, such as the IGZO film thickness and the edge length, have been discussed to reduce the hump occurrence under negative bias stress and illumination.	indium gallium zinc oxide;jt (visualization format);simulation;thickness (graph theory);thin-film transistor;tree accumulation	Daehyun Kim;Jong Tae Park	2015	Microelectronics Reliability	10.1016/j.microrel.2015.06.024	electronic engineering;engineering;optics;forensic engineering	EDA	91.38984676028215	-12.40583922859807	84996

A series of experiments was conducted to explore how changes of welding parameters affect the strength of the weld for the thin stainless steel most often used in the industry. The experiment results show that workpiece exposure height must be above a minimum limit in order to prevent undesired joining. The strength increases as the current increases, with fluctuations, but still in the sufficient range. The minimum sufficient current for quality welds increases, while the minimum sufficient heat input decreases, as the travel speed increases. 266 K-H.

But it states that when the film-screen combination system is being determined, either manual processing or automatic processing can be adopted. The different processing procedures will result in wide different sensitivities and average gradients. This paper describes the sensitometric determination of the film-screen combination systems of four types of medical x-ray films by the bootstrap method with manual processing and automatic processing. Their sensitometric results show that there are certain difference in the performance of the film-screen combination systems between the manual processing and the automatic processing. With the manual processing, the resultant sensitivity is faster and average gradient steeper, and min. density and max. density almost same with the automatic processing. These results are identical with the results obtained in the sensitometric determination by visible light exposure.	bootstrapping (statistics);gradient;maxima and minima;resultant;x-ray detector	Wang Yong-ming;Cao Hou-de	1999			analytical chemistry;materials science;x-ray	HPC	94.34532312990892	-21.82617673072931	85359

After a brief review of the conventional cavity perturbation theory, this paper discusses the change of quality factor of a resonant cavity due to the introduction of a dielectric sample. A new concept, expected quality factor Q0; is introduced in this paper to denote the quality factor of a resonant cavity loaded with a strictly no-loss sample, and a calibration procedure is proposed to find the frequency dependence of Q0: The conventional resonant perturbation formulas are then amended by substituting the quality factor before the perturbation with the expected quality factor Q0 corresponding to the frequency after the perturbation. Experiments show that the accuracy of resonant perturbation method has been greatly increased after the amendment, especially for extremely low-loss dielectric samples.	experiment;perturbation theory	Linfeng Chen;C.

For $\eta>0$, each single conductor occupies a simply connected domain, but the conductor closes to a ring in the limit $\eta\searrow 0$. This change of topology allows for an extra dimension in the solution space of the corresponding cell-problem. Even though both original materials (metal and void) have the same positive magnetic permeability $\mu_0>0$, the effective Maxwell system exhibits, depending on the frequency, a negative magnetic response.	maxwell (microarchitecture)	Agnes Lamacz;Ben Schweizer	2013	SIAM J.

The reactor is composed of two electrodes separated by a dielectric and arranged asymmetrically. The power supply system provides high voltage pulses with the following characteristics: voltage up to ±10 kV, rise and decay times less than 50 ns and a frequency of 2 kHz. The main results show that the regeneration performance increases with the applied voltage magnitude and the duration of treatment. Furthermore, depending on the polarity and the magnitude of the applied voltage pulse, the regenerated surface shape could be more uniform along the active electrode (negative pulses) or more extended on the dielectric surface (positive pulses). The regeneration mechanism remains not very well understood, but it seems that the soot particle size is reduced mainly due to the interaction with ozone molecules and oxygen radicals generated by the discharge.	active galactic nucleus;discharger;experiment;power supply;reactor (software)	Noureddine Zouzou;Arthur Claude Aba'a Ndong;Eric Moreau	2015	2015 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting	10.1109/IAS.2015.7356773	materials science;electronic engineering;electrical engineering;analytical chemistry;dielectric barrier discharge	Vision	94.69169032880117	-12.48993200366287	85645

All the clusters studied have two units of positive charges. The simulations reveal that in all the cases there is a cutoff size below which the clusters fragment. It is seen that for the case of pure Ar, the value is around 95 while that for Xe it is 55. For the mixed clusters with increasing Xe content, the cutoff limit for suppression of Coulomb explosion gradually decreases from 95 for a pure Ar to 55 for a pure Xe cluster. The hallmark of this study is this smooth progression. All the clusters are simulated using the reliable potential energy surface developed by Gay and Berne (Gay and Berne, Phys. Rev. Lett. 1982, 49, 194). For the hetero clusters, we have also discussed two different ways of charge distribution, that is one in which both positive charges are on two Xe atoms and the other where the two charges are at a Xe atom and at an Ar atom. The fragmentation patterns observed by us are such that single ionic ejections are the favored dissociating pattern. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	aortic valve insufficiency;ar (unix);atom;color gradient;coulomb;doping (semiconductor);forty nine;fragmentation (computing);ionic;john d. wiley;monte carlo;parallel tempering;potential energy surface;simulation;xenon;zero suppression;are unit of measure	Sankar Ghorai;Pinaki Chaudhury	2018	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.25156	computational chemistry;chemistry;cluster (physics);doping;parallel tempering;coulomb explosion;noble gas	HPC	96.7783936188427	-7.075626122161864	85747

The magnetic material inside the hydrogel fiber is regulated by the microfluidic chip and controlled as 5 mm of pure hydrogel with an interval of 500 µm of magnetic hydrogel. Two magnetic manipulation systems based on Maxwell coil and electromagnet are utilized to evaluate the magnetic response of the magnetic hydrogel fiber. Evaluation results show the magnetic hydrogel fiber can be patterned and aligned with the proposed system. The cultivation results of hydrogel fiber with C2C12 cells shows the potential for real applications of proposed method in tissue engineering.	append;connection-oriented ethernet;control system;gnu nano;maxwell (microarchitecture);mechatronics;optical fiber;systems engineering	Chengzhi Hu;Masahiro Nakajima;Tao Yue;Yajing Shen;Toshio Fukuda	2012	2012 International Symposium on Micro-NanoMechatronics and Human Science (MHS)	10.1109/MHS.2012.6492476	materials science;nanotechnology;biological engineering	Embedded	94.63791190026703	-16.492326061626905	85974

The question then arises of how quickly such signaling molecules can arrive at newly formed signaling regions. Here, we attack this problem by calculating asymptotic results for the mean first passage time for a diffusing particle confined to the surface of a sphere, in the presence of N partially absorbing traps of small radii. The rate at which the small diffusing molecule becomes captured by one of the traps is determined by asymptotically calculating the principal eigenvalue for the Laplace operator on the sphere with small localized traps. The asymptotic analysis relies on the method of matched asymptotic expansions, together with detailed properties of the Green’s function for the Laplacian and the Helmholtz operator on the surface of the unit sphere. The asymptotic results compare favorably with full numerical results.	asymptote;cell signaling;fekete polynomial;first-hitting-time model;numerical analysis;transduction (machine learning)	Daniel Coombs;Ronny Straube;Michael J.

The morphology of NCS self-assembled vesicles was investigated by SEM. Drug-releasing rates of vesicles made from longer alkyl chain and/or larger backbone molecular weight of NN-dialkyl chitosan are slower than shorter and smaller ones, and equilibrium drug-releasing ratios as well as releasing rates. The bio-experimental results indicate that NCS/PLLA blends are biodegradable and nontoxic. NCS is benefit to improve the cell affinity of PLLA.	british informatics olympiad;internet backbone;mathematical morphology;network computing system;processor affinity	Mingchun Li;Meihua Xin;Sheng Su;Wei Gao	2008	2008 International Conference on BioMedical Engineering and Informatics	10.1109/BMEI.2008.295	morphology;nanotechnology;scanning electron microscope;nanobiotechnology	DB	95.34878888830991	-15.97903190631555	86397
282a7bd7a5655bbfc1833ed7dd5ba1e362826ac5	extension of a clsvof method for droplet-laden flows with a coalescence/breakup model	film drainage model;breakup;clsvof method;collision;droplet laden flow;coalescence	A multiple marker Coupled Level-Set/Volume-of-Fluid (CLSVOF) method for droplet-laden flows has been extended with a physical model to accommodate coalescence and breakup of the droplets. In the CLSVOF method each droplet has its own locally defined marker functions. This prevents the problem of numerical coalescence in conventional Level-Set and Volume-of-Fluid methods when two droplet interfaces are less than one grid cell apart from each other. In the present model coalescence is based on a computationally efficient film drainage model, which predicts if and when two colliding droplets will coalesce. If the contact time between two colliding droplets exceeds the predicted film drainage time, coalescence is numerically accomplished by merging the marker functions of the two separate droplets. Similarly, breakup of a droplet is accommodated by splitting the marker functions of the droplet. Simulations are shown for (near) head-on collision of two equal droplets at Weber numbers of 2.3, 9.33, 13.63, and 61.4, corresponding to four different collision regimes. The good agreement with the experimental data for each Weber number demonstrates the capability of the CLSVOF method to simulate coalescence and breakup with physical realism. A sensitivity study has shown a strong sensitivity of the collision dynamics on the prescribed film drainage time, while the influence of the spatial grid resolution appears to be small. This underlines the importance of accurate models for the film drainage time.	coalescing (computer science)	Marcel Kwakkel;Wim-Paul Breugem;Bendiks Jan Boersma	2013	J. Comput.

Aluminum-induced crystallization of a-Si film has been achieved by thermal annealing only at around 400 °C. The Experimental results reveal that the Al on top of a-Si arrangement has more evident effect in crystallization enhancement than that with Al under a-Si, and the resultant poly-Si films show preferred (400) crystal orientation. It is verified that aluminum can cause lateral crystallization of a-Si film. No preferred orientation was noticed from lateral crystallization samples.		X. B. Zeng;J. F. Li;X. W. Sun;G. J. Qi;X. T.

We demonstrate that comparing the reference with the Pt nanocrystals embedded devices, important enhancement of switching characteristics is obtained, in terms of uniformity and enlarged switching ratio. Our results indicate that the switching characteristics of TiO2-x device are very strongly related with the control of conductive filaments' growth within the dielectric layer, which stems from the local enhancement of the electric field in the vicinity of nanocrystals. This effect in conjunction with the room temperature fabrication process and the forming free nature of the thin films is considered as an optimization route of resistive random access memory design.	circuit complexity;embedded system;mathematical optimization;random access;resistive random-access memory;semiconductor device fabrication	Panagiotis Bousoulas;D.

These components do not occur in the same portion of the ommatidium. During dark adaptation one can plot the height of the response evoked by a constant stimulus presented at regular intervals of time after the adapting light is removed. Hyperpolarizing current influences the shape of the curve obtained by this means. Increasing potassium ion concentration in the external medium reduces the height of the ommatidial potential. The steady component is decreased more by high potassium than the final component. Removing calcium ion from the medium abolishes the transient component.	acclimatization;action potential;calcium ion;dark adaptation;dietary potassium;iontophoresis;limulus test	Stephen S.

One approach is a further development of the neutralization method of Bellido and Rullmann (J Comput Chem 1989, 10, 479-487) while the other is based on removing part of the electron density before performing the multipole expansion. Both methods create systems with integer charges without using charge renormalization. To determine their performance in terms of location of cuts and distance to QM region, the new DAQ approaches are tested in calculations of the proton affinity of N(zeta) of Lys55 in the inhibitor turkey ovomucoid third domain. Finally, the two methods are used to build a variety of MM regions, applied to calculations of the pK(a) of Lys55, and compared to other computational methodologies in which force field charges are employed.	force field (chemistry);fork–join model;incised wound;integer (number);ovomucin;processor affinity;protons;q-chem;qm/mm;quad electrostatic loudspeaker;electron density	Pablo A.

We propose a CD microfluidic platform, including a microchannel network consisting of a plasma separation microchannel network and a mixer microchannel network. As the disk rotates, the centrifugal force causes the separation of blood cells and plasma because of their different densities. The blood cells enter a collection chamber, while the plasma flows to the downstream mixer microchannel network. Numerical simulations are performed to investigate the flow characteristics and mixing performance of three CD microfluidic mixers. The results show that given an appropriate specification of the microchannel geometry and a CD rotation speed of 1800 rpm, 90% separation efficiency is achieved for diluted blood with a hematocrit of 6%, and a mixing efficiency of more than 92% can be obtained within 3 s at an angular frequency of 2000 rpm.	angularjs;centrifugal governor;computational fluid dynamics;downstream (software development);numerical linear algebra;plasma active;simulation	Bo-Shiun Li;Ju-Nan Kuo	2013	The 8th Annual IEEE International Conference on Nano/Micro Engineered and Molecular Systems	10.1109/NEMS.2013.6559770	chromatography;microfluidics;chemistry;cd-rom;lab-on-a-chip;analytical chemistry;nanotechnology;mixing;physics	Visualization	93.8078380322891	-15.794220519001653	87042
a46a4ccb09322f8a338bb0694dde1096f8055054	process modelling of dimethyl ether production from victorian brown coal - integrating coal drying, gasification and synthesis processes		Power plants using Victorian brown coal operate at low efficiency. Being reactive and spontaneously combustible, dried brown coals cannot be exported either. Synthesis of dimethyl ether (DME) is one option for the production of liquid fuel, an exportable product for power generation and transportation. This paper presents a steady-state process model for DME production using brown coal including drying, gasification and DME synthesis. The yield of the DME was a maximum for H2 to CO molar ratio of 1.41 and 0.81 at the gasifier outlet and the DME reactor inlet respectively. A process efficiency of 32% and CO2 emission of 2.91 kg/kg of DME was obtained. Improved yield of DME is achieved when CO2 is removed from the fuel gas prior to feeding to the synthesis reactor. Integration of waste heat and design of appropriate catalyst for gasification and DME synthesis can result in further improvements in the process.
