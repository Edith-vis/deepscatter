In this paradigm, servers are responsible for all performance-intensive operations, and thus suffer from poor scalability. An alternative paradigm is called graphics streaming, in which graphics commands and data are offloaded to the clients for local rendering, thereby mitigating the server's burden and allowing more concurrent game sessions. Unfortunately, this approach is bandwidth-consuming, due to large amounts of graphic commands and geometry data. In this paper, we present LiveRender, an open-source gaming system that remedies the problem by implementing a suite of bandwidth optimization techniques including intraframe compression, interframe compression, and caching, establishing what we call compressed graphics streaming. Experiments results show that the new approach is able to reduce bandwidth consumption by 52%-73% compared to raw graphics streaming, with no perceptible difference in video quality and reduced response delay. Compared to the video streaming approach, LiveRender achieves a traffic reduction of 40%-90% with even improved video quality and substantially smaller response delay, while enabling higher concurrency at the server.	cloud computing;cloud gaming;concurrency (computer science);graphics;intra-frame coding;mathematical optimization;open-source software;programming paradigm;scalability;server (computing);streaming media;video	Xiaofei Liao;Li Lin;Guang Tan;Hai Jin;Xiaobin Yang;Wei Zhang;Bo Li	2016	IEEE/ACM Trans.

e55fc3a96788db3c2f46d82c8aee26cbc20efabc	technology integration framework for fast and low cost handovers - case study: wifi-wimax network	technology integration	The Next Generation Wireless Networks (NGWNs) are seemed to be heterogeneous networks based on the integration of several wireless technologies. These networks are required to achieve performances equivalent to classic wireless networks by ensuring the continuity of communications and the homogeneity of network management during horizontal and vertical handovers. This task is even more important when management services, like security and quality of service (QoS), are deployed at access technology level. In this paper, we propose a framework for heterogeneous wireless technology integration based on network architecture skeleton and a handover management mechanism. This framework optimizes the layer-2 handover procedure to achieve performances required by sensitive applications while ensuring the minimization of signaling overhead required for operated networks. As an application example, we make use of this framework to propose a heterogeneous network based on WiFi and WiMAX technologies. We present an application example of the framework using the specification of a WiFi-WiMAX network. We propose several performance evaluations based on simulation tests based on this application. The latter confirm the efficiency of handover delay optimization and the minimization of management signaling costs.	access network;assistive technology;centrality;mathematical optimization;network architecture;next-generation network;overhead (computing);performance;population;quality of service;robustness (computer science);scott continuity;simulation;software deployment;transmission (bittorrent client)	Mohamed Kassab;Jean-Marie Bonnin;Abdelfettah Belghith	2010	Journal Comp.

A large number of handover mechanisms have been reported in the literature. We carry out a comprehensive QoS performance study of the handover mechanisms as proposed in the literature and a performance evaluation of various buffer management schemes used to compensate for service disruption caused during the handover phase. A detailed simulation model has been developed allowing us to set up parameters such as the speed and motion path of the mobile terminal. The performance metrics of interest are: the overall response time of the handover mechanism, the length of the disruption time caused by the handover mechanism and the number of lost packets caused by the handover mechanism. In our simulation study, we have made use of MPEG-4 video sources to evaluate the various buffer management mechanisms. The video is encoded using a layered coding scheme. Under the scenario under consideration, the handover using multicasting mechanism and the push-out buffer management mechanism exhibit the best results.	denial-of-service attack;mobile phone;multicast;network switch;performance evaluation;quality of service;response time (technology);simulation	Rosa Risueño;Pedro Cuenca;Francisco Delicado;Luis Orozco-Barbosa;Antonio Jose Garrido del Solo	2004	24th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops, 2004.

While the home network is typically shielded off as much as possible from the ‘outside world’, the supplied services could be greatly extended if it was possible to use local information. In this article, an extended service is presented that integrates the user's multimedia content, scattered over multiple devices in the home network, into the Electronic Program Guide (EPG) of the Digital TV. We propose to virtualize the set-top box, by migrating all functionality except user interfacing to the service provider infrastructure. The media in the home network is discovered through standard Universal Plug and Play (UPnP), of which the QoS functionality is exploited to ensure high quality playback over the home network, that basically is out of the control of the service provider. The performance of the subsystems are analysed.	application lifecycle management;business logic;display resolution;internet;interoperability;overhead (computing);plug computer;quality of service;server (computing);set-top box;universal plug and play;virtualize	Bert Vankeirsbilck;Jelle Nelis;Dieter Verslype;Chris Develder;Tom Van Leeuwen;Bart Dhoedt	2010	IEEE Local Computer Network Conference	10.1109/LCN.2010.5735763	universal plug and play;provider edge;embedded system;digital television;telecommunications;computer science;service delivery framework;operating system;world wide web;computer network	Networks	-15.228664663147237	93.15295270857362	24014

However, existing handover process system still has latency affects time-sensitive applications. In this paper, the handover procedures of 802.16e and Fast Handover for Hierarchical MIPv6 (F-HMIPv6) are reconstructed to achieve a better transmission performance. The concept of cross layer design is adopted to refine the existing handover procedure specified in 802.16e MAC layer and F-HMIPv6. More specifically, layer2 and layer3 signaling messages for handover are analyzed and combined/interleaved to optimize the handover performance. Extensive simulations show that the proposed scheme in this paper is superior to the other scheme proposed by IETF.	automatic parallelization;internet;level of detail;mathematical optimization;mobile ip;process architecture;simulation	Yi Zheng;Yong Zhang;Yinglei Teng;Mei Song	2009	Communications and Network	10.4236/cn.2009.11005	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;handover;operating system;soft handover;computer network	Mobile	-11.45595964587384	89.81474063339226	24350

We evaluate these systems using two measures: generalized uptime and traditional downtime. We define the Impact Weighted System Uptime (IWSU) and illustrate its usefulness in practical terms, viz., an IP router. Next, we provide an analysis that fits the downtimes by a heavy-tailed log PH distribution. For these downtime distributions, we study whether it is more cost effective to reduce failure rates or to speed up the response to failures The first option is a vendor problem, but the second is a service provider problem. A numerical example is given to help appreciate the tradeoff.	circuit restoration;downtime;fits;failure cause;numerical analysis;router (computing);uptime;viz: the computer game	Edward G.

The inherent variability in both video bitrate and network bandwidth negatively impacts the user Quality of Experience (QoE), motivating the design of better DASH-compliant adaptation algorithms. In this paper we present ARBITER, a novel streaming adaptation algorithm that explicitly integrates the variations in both video and network dynamics in its adaptation decisions. Our simulation-based performance evaluation, using real video content and cellular bandwidth traces, shows that ARBITER achieves an excellent tradeoff among streaming metrics in terms of received video quality, stall count, stall duration, and switching dynamics, leading to a relative improvement of 17-45% in user QoE in comparison to state-of-the-art algorithms.	arbiter (electronics);digital video;dynamic adaptive streaming over http;heart rate variability;hypertext transfer protocol;performance evaluation;push technology;simulation;streaming algorithm;streaming media;tracing (software)	Ahmed H.

c3ff7d98c81a1c993c441027ccfdfb86cdd65c0e	ip video conferencing: a tutorial		Video conferencing is a well-established area of communications, which have been studied for decades. Recently this area has received a new impulse due to significantly increased bandwidth of Local and Wide area networks, appearance of low-priced video equipment and development of web based media technologies. This paper presents the main techniques behind the modern IP-based videoconferencing services, with a particular focus on codecs, network protocols, architectures and standardization efforts. Questions of security and topologies are also tackled. A description of a typical video conference scenario is provided, demonstrating how the technologies, responsible for different conference aspects, are working together. Traditional industrial disposition as well as modern innovative approaches are both addressed. Current industry trends are highlighted in respect to the topics, described in the tutorial.

7a74267920cd2fb314639a472fbb4b47a52ddde2	a zone-based media independent information service for ieee 802.21 networks		Next generation networks integrate different wireless technologies, including Wi-Fi, Wi-Max, and 3GPP (UMTS, HSPA, and/or LTE), in which the mobile node (MN) has the opportunity to switch from one network to another, under an always best connected scheme. In such heterogeneous environment, discovering which types of network connectivity and services are available is a critical challenge. The IEEE 802.21 standard specifies a network information server entity providing network information within a geographical area by which the MN can discover a service or a network. In this paper, we propose a zone-based media independent information service using the IEEE 802.21 standard to accelerate the neighbor discovery procedure. In the proposed scheme, the access networks are associated and grouped in mobility zones, through an efficient set of rules, to minimize the amount of control messages flowing in the core network. Through a NS-2 based simulation, the results demonstrate that the proposed scheme reduces the neighbor discovery delay as well as the signaling overhead if compared with the standard MIIS deployment.

With the integration of the two proposed techniques, KQStream provides more flexibility in heterogeneous peer-to-peer environments and configurable playback with dynamic QoS-aware regulating.	academy;multiple description coding;peer-to-peer;quality of service;scalability;scott continuity;simulation;streaming media	Yuan He;Tao Gu;Jiang Guo;Jingyao Dai	2007	2007 International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops (ICPPW 2007)	10.1109/ICPPW.2007.48	stream processing;quality of service;computer science;multiple description coding;distributed computing;world wide web;computer network	DB	-8.571340729119019	96.27211017235818	25640
d0aacb778080bff12e8ec65714d9b3e6e268dc2d	designing efficient mobile gateway for impoverished regions based on self-learning strategy		Multiple wireless access technology had tremendously extended the coverage of Internet from developed cities to impoverished regions. As the significant network equipment, mobile gateway had been assigned more and more tasks. However, the efficiency issues are still challenging. Motivated by the latest progress in self-learning, we proposed a new scheme for mobile gateway design. Firstly, the network architecture and supported new features of mobile gateway are discussed to provide a macroscopic impression. Secondly, the application scenarios and functional modules are explored from network and user oriented plane’s perspectives.The implementation of intraplane and interplane interactions is carefully illustrated.Thirdly, the transitions ofmultiple states are analyzed based on possible network context. Fourthly, three typical self-learning schemes are briefly examined and two representative algorithms are adopted. Necessary procedures for deployment are also demonstrated via pseudocodes. Then the interactive process in both network and user oriented cases is investigated. In order to validate the performance, a comprehensive topology with background traffic is established. Simulation results reveal that our hybrid scheme could overcome single parameter based scheme in most of the scenarios.

However, the session-based QoS control defined in NGN standardizations is not designed for layer 2 infrastructures, but for border gateway function (BGF) at IP edge. To achieve QoS assurance for NGN services, end-to-end network resource management, including layer 2 access and metro networks, is required. Although the BGF function needs to be introduced at IP edge, legacy infrastructures must be utilized especially for access and metro networks. Incorporating those widely deployed legacy infrastructures into session-based QoS control mechanisms is expected. However, differences in user-flow identification of NGN and resource identification required for managing legacy infrastructures induce gaps blocking integration to the unified session-based infrastructure. This paper proposes to use a network middleware for bridging NGN control frameworks and legacy infrastructures. With the multiple service oriented architecture (SOA) chain, the network middleware distributedly coordinates middleware element managing each network segments, and harmonizes differences of resource description and control procedures in NGN and legacy infrastructures. The network middleware enables to maintain coherent QoS policy for the end-to-end route of the session-based services throughout the heterogeneous and multi-layer infrastructures.	attachments;bandwidth management;blocking (computing);bridging (networking);coherence (physics);control system;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;influence diagram;layer (electronics);middleware;next-generation network;quality of service;scalability;service-oriented architecture	Nobutaka Matsumoto;Michiaki Hayashi;Hideaki Tanaka	2009	2009 Next Generation Internet Networks	10.1109/NGI.2009.5175770	next-generation network;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Networks	-13.452889840657281	91.87452594096011	26638

High data rates (approaching 100 Mbit/s in the downlink direction and 50 Mbit/s for uplink connections) and small delays are attractive features of LTE. Spectrum flexibility also makes deployment easy on various frequency bands in different parts of the world. However, as LTE offers packet switched services only, mobile broadband connectivity has become the dominant LTE application so far.

As an example, we propose ReWAN, a packet recovery service for real time, wide area communication. ReWAN uses cloud-based edge proxies that exchange """"recovery"""" packets, which are used only in case of packet loss. ReWAN leverages the cloud provider's well-connected, global data center network, and its ability to handle many concurrent users. To minimize bandwidth cost, it uses coding to generate a small number of recovery packets that are sent across the inter data center network. The recovery packets use both FEC, which is applied within a user stream, and network coding, which is applied across user streams. If a small fraction of packets within the user stream are lost, ReWAN uses the FEC packets for recovery; for other losses, ReWAN recovers them with the help of other receivers and the network coded packets. Preliminary measurements show the promise of ReWAN in providing a fast and cost effective packet recovery service."""	best-effort delivery;cloud computing;data center;forward error correction;linear network coding;network packet	Osama Haq;Fahad R.

It remains an open issue how to build a scalable PMIPv6 domain that is able to support a large number of MNs while keeping handover delays low. In this paper, we propose an approach for building Scalable And Robust PMIPv6 (SARP) domains. We propose that every mobility access gateway (MAG) in a SARP domain also functions as a local mobility anchor (LMA), and is organized into a virtual ring with all other MAGs. Consistent hashing is used to efficiently distribute the mapping between each MN and its LMA to all MAGs. A MAG finds an MN's LMA by sending a query message to the virtual ring. Our analysis verifies the robustness and scalability of SARP. We also propose two handover procedures for SARP and show that they achieve low handover delays.	consistent hashing;distributed hash table;mobile ip;proxy mobile ipv6;public key infrastructure;public-key cryptography;scalability;server (computing);waypoint	Hongbin Luo;Hongke Zhang;Yajuan Qin;Victor C.

However, providing a quality video delivery over wireless networks poses many challenges due to a high Bit Error Rate (BER), time-varying characteristics of wireless channels and a stringent delay and delay jitter requirement for real-time applications. To solve these problems, a suite of interoperable approaches must be devised for enhancing the robustness of video streaming to the error-prone environment. In this paper, we propose a Differentiated Automatic Repeat Request (DARQ) scheme for MPEG video streaming over wireless links, in which the inter-frame dependency and error propagation are jointly considered and a specific retransmission attempt is assigned to each frame in a Group of Pictures (GOP) according to its significance in the reconstruction of the video at the end-user. Both analytical modelling and extensive simulations have been conducted to verify the proposed scheme. The results demonstrate that the playable frame rate can be substantially improved by using the DARQ scheme compared with that by ARQ schemes employing the uniform retransmission persistency for all frames or assigning the retransmission persistency only depending on the frame type.

Seamless IP diversity based NEMO (SINEMO) outperforms NEMO BSP in terms of handoff latency and related packet loss by utilizing the advanced loss recovery mechanism and multi-homing feature of stream control transmission protocol (SCTP). To support micro mobility in NEMO, HMIPv6 can be used with NEMO BSP which together reduce handoff latency and related packet loss significantly. For further improvement of handoff performance of NEMO BSP, FHMIPv6, the extension of FMIPv6 and HMIPv6 could be utilized in NEMO. In this paper, handoff performance of NEMO BSP along with micro mobility support of HMIPv6 (M-NEMO) and FHMIPv6 (FM-NEMO) are analytically compared with SINEMO based on handoff latency, handoff blocking probability and packet loss during handoff.

This enables service providers to monitor their systems and to optimise their networks. BT has an established history of using auditory models in live telephone networks to assess network performance. Users are beginning to demand bi-modal information streams (audio-visual rather than audio only) and it has thus become necessary to develop PQOS measures for multi-modal systems. When assessing and modelling multi-modal systems, it is imperative that cross-modal interaction is taken into account, as a simple combination of mono-modal models will not give a robust perceived-quality performance metric. This paper describes work carried out at BT Labs into modelling audio-visual quality perception with a particular emphasis on cross-modal interaction. The work described includes subjective tests to provide data for the model.	modal logic	Andrew Rimell;Mike Hollier	1999		10.1109/MMSP.1999.794134	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;human factors and ergonomics;multimedia;communications system;computer network	HCI	-9.041835787874914	100.95902041298353	27530

For faster than 1 Gbps connectivity, infrared communication devices are employed. As the network mobility protocol in IPv6, NEMO Basic Support Protocol is adopted. This paper focuses on a fast handover mechanism in the network layer. For fast handover, a cross-layer architecture called CEAL is employed. The proposed fast handover mechanism was installed on Linux. As the first step of the goal, we had a field test using a train in service of JR-West (West Japan Railway Company). The speed of the train is 120--130 km/h. The total handover time is 124.0 msec in the best case. Bi-directional video streaming was also succeeded.

This decision is typically made by looking up a protocol control block (PCB) for the segment, based on information in the segment's header. PCB lookup (a form of demultiplexing) is typically one of the more expensive operations in handling inbound protocol segment [Fe190]. Many recent protocol optimizations for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) [Jac88] assume that a large component of TCP traffic is bulk-data transfers, which result in packet trains [JR86]. If packet trains are prevalent, there is a high likelihood that the next TCP segment is en route to the same application (i.e. uses the same PCB) as the previous TCP segment. In these environments a very simple one-PCB cache like those used in BSD systems yields very high cache hit rates. However, there are classes of applications that do not form packet trains, and these applications do not perform well with a one-PCB cache. Examples of such applications are quite common in the area of heads-down data entry into on-line transaction-processing (OLTP) systems. OLTP systems make heavy use of computer communications networks and have large aggregate-packet-rates but are also characterized by large numbers of connections, low per-connection packet rates, and rather small packets. This combination of characteristics results in a very low incidence of packet trains. This paper uses a simple analytic approach to examine how different PCB lookup schemes perform with OLTP traffic. One scheme is shown to work an order of magnitude better for OLTP traffic than the one-PCB cache approach while still maintaining good performance for packet-train traffic.	aggregate data;algorithm;approximation;bsd;bandwidth (signal processing);benchmark (computing);cache (computing);ibm tivoli storage productivity center;inbound marketing;incidence matrix;lookup table;move-to-front transform;multiplexing;network packet;online and offline;online transaction processing;paging;printed circuit board;requirement;telecommunications network	Paul E.

The P2P approach for IPTV has the appealing feature of providing TV-like quality content distribution service (for both on-demand and live TV), which has been attracting a large number of users from across the globe. However, there is very little understanding about their network architecture and resource consumption. This work aims at having an in-depth understanding of Joost, a video-on-demand P2P system for distributing TV content, created by Skype and Kazaa founders. Results show that Joost relies on UDP for content delivery with an asymmetric bandwidth consumption of until 750 Kbps (download) and 480 Kbps (upload). We also evaluated the Joost control plane, which is mainly based on TCP. Along with other P2P IPTV technologies, such systems could have a great impact on network bandwidth utilization, even more than P2P file transfer ones.	content delivery network;control plane;data rate units;digital distribution;download;file transfer;iptv;network architecture;peer-to-peer;upload	Josilene Moreira;Rafael Antonello;Stenio F.

324b9f599ce12ff641aa247b7470c541092b94db	a client-driven media synchronization mechanism for rtp packet-based video streaming	video streaming;rtp rtcp;synchronization accuracy;lip synchronization;media synchronization	Media synchronization is used to correctly playback a video stream with its associated audio. To support synchronization between video and audio streams transported over IP networks, an RTP/RTCP protocol suite is usually employed. In conventional server-driven media synchronization, the server needs to periodically transmit an RTCP sender report (SR) packet to provide the client with a UTC time in NTP format corresponding to the RTP timestamp carried by each RTP packet. In this paper, we propose a precise client-driven media synchronization mechanism for an RTP packet-based multimedia streaming service. In the proposed method, the server does not need to send any RTCP SR packets for synchronization. Instead, the client device derives the precise normal play time (NPT) for each video and audio stream from the received RTP packets containing an RTP timestamp. Simulations show that the proposed client-driven synchronization method can provide accurate media synchronization without employing an RTCP SR packet and accordingly reduce the initial synchronization delay, the processing complexity at the client device, the number of required user datagram protocol ports, and the amount of control traffic injected into the network.	apollonian network;datagram;internet protocol suite;network packet;protocol stack;server (computing);simulation;streaming media	Tae-jun Jung;Kwang-deok Seo	2015	Journal of Real-Time Image Processing	10.1007/s11554-015-0497-3	embedded system;real-time computing;rtp control protocol;computer science;data synchronization;frame synchronization;computer network	Metrics	-6.1702793568158265	93.78607553758486	28477

More precisely, we use the ABR service and ow control, where routers become virtual sources (VSs) and virtual destinations (VDs) for the ABR control loop.

090724a35ca49940d0a6b85810bbd4f929bda739	qoe estimation of compound services in significance-aware packet networks		The paper presents a method to protect more significant packets of a compound service transported via User Datagram Protocol (UDP) at the expense of dropping less significant packets in case of network congestion. This requires a mapping scheme that allows lower layers (e.g., the data link layer) to inherit some “significance” information from the application layer. This information is used by the network elements for packet drop decisions. That mapping scheme combined with the additional insertion of packets conveying statistical information about the compound stream simplifies the quality of service measurements along the network path. In order to capture the timing behavior of packet transport (e.g., jitter) a virtual buffer is also introduced, allowing a simplified measurement of acceptable packet delay variation. Both measures allow a quality of experience (QoE) estimation without the need for complex service processing.	datagram;network congestion;network packet;packet delay variation;quality of service	Gerhard Gehrke;Ralf Hocke;Georg Wenzel	2008	Bell Labs Technical Journal	10.1002/bltj.20327	media delivery index;packet drop attack;link state packet;real-time computing;packet analyzer;network packet;packet generator;telecommunications;computer science;packet segmentation;processing delay;network scheduler;end-to-end delay;packet forwarding;transmission delay;packet loss;packet switch;computer network	Networks	-4.9814511686445	98.65313592020938	28745

In this article, we propose an inter-system handover method that does not require in-line measurements on WLAN. It identifies the most probable WLAN Access Point for handover, from coverage point of view, depending on UMTS signal measurements and on a handover probability database. This method can be implemented in the RNC, or in a B3G common controller. Simulation results in a WLAN hot spot deployment show that handover based on a priori knowledge of the networks increases handover success rate, compared to classical blind handover. Its performance can be improved by optimizing the handover probability database. Besides, the proposed method enables to forecast handover's success, and adapt accordingly. Handover based on a priori knowledge of the networks can consequently be integrated into several B3G handover algorithms, to decrease handover delay and complexity.	algorithm;hotspot (wi-fi);point of view (computer hardware company);seamless3d;simulation;software deployment;wireless access point	Mylene Pischella;Franck Lebeugle;Sana Ben Jemaa	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2006.255065	gsm;real-time computing;a priori and a posteriori;telecommunications;computer science;handover;operating system;electrical impedance;signal processing;mobile computing;hot spot;umts frequency bands;soft handover;computer network	Robotics	-11.961672589766147	91.18247933504091	29082

Hence, several techniques were developed to make this protocol exhibit real-time behavior, some of them requiring specialized hardware, others providing soft-real-time guarantees only, or others achieving hard real-time guarantees with different levels of bandwidth efficiency. More recently, there has been an effort to support quality-of-service (QoS) negotiation and enforcement but there is not yet an Ethernet-based data link protocol capable of providing dynamic QoS management to further exploit the variable requirements of dynamic applications. This paper presents the FTT-Ethernet protocol, which efficiently supports hard-real-time operation in a flexible way, seamlessly over shared or switched Ethernet. The FTT-Ethernet protocol employs an efficient master/multislave transmission control technique and combines online scheduling with online admission control, to guarantee continued real-time operation under dynamic communication requirements, together with data structures and mechanisms that are tailored to support dynamic QoS management. The paper includes a sample application, aiming at the management of video streams, which highlights the protocol's ability to support dynamic QoS management with real-time guarantees.	automation;closed-circuit television;communications protocol;data structure;distributed computing;network switch;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time operating system;real-time transcription;requirement;shark;scheduling (computing);spectral efficiency;streaming media;temporal isolation	Paulo Pedreiras;Paolo Gai;Luis Fernando de Almeida;Giorgio C.

6928661f779e1831eef00f36c72348aa8ffdc657	improving the packet send-time accuracy in embedded devices		A number of projects deploy Linux-based embedded systems to carry out large-scale active network measurement and network experiments. Due to resource constrains and the increase of network speed, obtaining sound measurement results from these low-end devices is very challenging. In this paper, we present a novel network primitive, OMware, to improve the packet send-time accuracy by enabling the measurement application to pre-dispatch the packet content and its schedule into the kernel. By this pre-dispatch approach, OMware can also reduce the overheads in timestamp retrievals and sleeping, and the interference from other application processes. Our evaluation shows that OMware can achieve a microsecond-level accuracy (rather than millisecond-level in a user-space tool) in the interdeparture time of packet trains, even under heavy cross traffic. OMware also offers optimized call for sending back-to-back packet pairs, which can reduce the minimum inter-packet gap by 2 to 10 times. Furthermore, OMware can help reduce the error of replaying archived traffic from 40% to at almost 19%.	active networking;archive;dynamic dispatch;embedded system;experiment;interference (communication);linux;network packet;user space	Ricky K.

Quality of service can only be ensured if the paths are reliable - perform to specification per request. This paper makes four contributions to research. First, it presents Reliable Video over Software-Defined Networking (RVSDN) which builds upon previous work of Video over Software-Defined Networking (VSDN) to address the issue of finding the most reliable path(s) through the network for video applications. Second, it presents the design and implementation of RVSDN. Third, it presents the experience of integrating RVSDN into ns-3 which is a network simulator used by the research community to simulate and model computer networks. Finally, it presents the results of RVSDN in terms of the number of requests serviced by the network architecture. RVSDN is able to service 31 times more requests than VSDN and MPLS explicit routing when the reliability constraint is 0.995 or greater using aggregation of reliability across network paths.	end-to-end principle;multiprotocol label switching;network architecture;quality of service;routing;simulation;software-defined networking	Harold Owens;Arjan Durresi;Raj Jain	2014	2014 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7037097	media delivery index;multiprotocol label switching;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;network traffic control;real-time computing;jitter;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;reliability;distributed computing;bandwidth;statistics;computer network	Networks	-5.888521518828752	94.79365537638428	29355

In this paper, we propose an admission control mechanism for Cloud computing. In particular we consider the high volume of simultaneous requests for Cloud services and develop admission control for aggregated traffic flows to address this challenge. By employ network calculus, we determine effective bandwidth for aggregate flow, which is used for making admission control decision. In order to improve network resource allocation while achieving Cloud service QoS, we investigate the relationship between effective bandwidth and equivalent capacity. We have also conducted extensive experiments to evaluate performance of the proposed admission control mechanism.	aggregate data;cloud computing;experiment;network calculus;provisioning;quality of service;requirement	Yunlong He;Jun Huang;Qiang Duan;Zi Xiong;Juan Lv;Yanbing Liu	2014	CoRR		simulation;cloud computing;computer science;cloud testing;distributed computing;computer network	HPC	-8.658773066872248	94.81407039538527	29359

Quality of Experience (QoE) management is one of the major challenges for video delivery given the limited bandwidth for wireless access network causing video packet drops and the core network congestion impacting video service delay. In this context, the current TCP-based model used for HTTP streaming presents challenges due to throughput variation and high latency. We present a context-adaptive cross-layer optimization approach to enhance video streaming over TCP that introduces network and content awareness in TCP operation to provide adaptive reliability and smoother throughput. Our proposed solution requires implementation changes only on the receiver side without impacting the TCP sender implementation. We validated the proposed solution through OPNET simulations and the results show some significant performance gains in both TCP throughput and video QoE metrics.	access network;digital video;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;hypertext transfer protocol;internet;mathematical optimization;network congestion;network packet;personalization;simulation;streaming media;throughput;time of arrival	Zheng Lu;V.

The network operates on monomode optical bre and is currently designed for an eventual line rate of 1000 Mbit/sec. The bandwidth of the bre optic channel can be partitioned into a number (currently four) TDM channels. This enables stations of varying cost and bandwidth to be attached to one network, parameterised by the number of channels a station can use concurrently. This paper gives an overview of the CBN station hardware and software design and reports preliminary performance measurements of the rst implementation in terms of throughput and response time. The main purpose of these studies was to identify the potential bottlenecks in the current CBN hardware and software architecture to give some ideas for future development.	atm turbo;bottleneck (software);internet backbone;megabit;response time (technology);software architecture;software design;throughput	David J.

Envelope is based on a multi-link recursive extension of unbiased single-hop estimators proposed in the past (e.g., [14]) and a variation of the packet-cartouche technique [6]. Through extensive simulations, we evaluate Envelope in various network settings and cross-traffic conditions and find that it can measure tight-link bandwidth characteristics with accuracy that significantly surpasses that of the existing methods. We also find that Envelope can measure non-tight links in certain path and cross-traffic configurations.	converge;end-to-end principle;hop;interference (communication);network packet;recursion;sampling (signal processing);simulation	Seong-ryong Kang;Amit Bhati;Dmitri Loguinov;Xiliang Liu	2006	26th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS'06)	10.1109/ICDCS.2006.57	mathematical optimization;the internet;convergence;computer science;interference;bandwidth;statistics	Mobile	-4.772160745266532	90.7747037386508	29946

In order for some applications to migrate to an Ethernet network, enhancements needed to be made in the form of data center bridging (DCB). DCB consists of both point-to-point protocols as well as end-toend protocols that all need to be tested to ensure vendors' products work together in a heterogeneous environment to prevent frame loss during congestion. This article discusses what each of the four protocols is and how to test the protocols separately as well as in combination in order to observe the interactions of DCB with different applications. The information provided in this article is drawn from the authors' experience testing DCB over the past three years and in 13 different industry wide interoperability events.	bridging (networking);data center bridging;interaction;interoperability;network congestion;point-to-point protocol;vergence	Mikkel Hagen;Peter Scruton;Robert Noseworthy;Ryan Zarick;Radim Bartos	2012	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2012.6163594	communications protocol;interoperability;data center;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;open system;ethernet;computer network;bandwidth allocation	Networks	-12.535224557413445	92.73428197342018	29995

The integration and interoperability of this multitude of available networks will lead to the emergence of the fourth generation (4G) of wireless technologies. 4G wireless technologies have the potential to provide these features and many more, which at the end will change the way we use mobile devices and provide a wide variety of new applications. However, such technology does not come without its challenges. One of these challenges is the user's ability to control and manage handoffs across heterogeneous wireless networks. This paper proposes a solution to this problem using artificial neural networks (ANNs). The proposed method is capable of distinguishing the best existing wireless network that matches predefined user preferences set on a mobile device when performing a vertical handoff. The overall performance of the proposed method shows 87.0 % success rate in finding the best available wireless network. To test for the robustness and effectiveness of the neural network algorithm, some of the features were removed from the training set and results showed a significant impact on the overall performance of the system. Hence, managing vertical handoffs through user preferences can be significantly affected with the selection of features used to provide the closest match of the available wireless networks.	algorithm;artificial neural network;backpropagation;best, worst and average case;emergence;end-to-end encryption;hidden markov model;interoperability;middleware;mobile device;network security;next-generation network;provisioning;quality of service;real-time transcription;seamless3d;self-organizing map;system configuration;test set;user (computing);user interface;variometer	Nidal Nasser;Sghaier Guizani;Eyhab Al-Masri	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2007.940	wireless wan;heterogeneous network;wireless site survey;computer science;operating system;wireless network;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security;artificial neural network;computer network	Mobile	-12.260421470841402	93.14466437313615	30327

These applications raised significant challenges in the media security, processing and transmissions. Especially, when 3D videos are delivered over wireless networks, the video streaming suffers the potential malicious attacks. One of the most important security challenging issues is how to guarantee the integrity of media content over error-prone wireless networks. To address this challenge, in the paper, we for the first time propose an authentication approach for 3D video transmission over wireless networks, which can improve the reconstructed media quality under error-prone wireless environment with lower authentication overheads and energy consumption. The proposed method is based on color-depth 3D video coding approach, which can save bandwidth, be tolerable to packet losses and thus satisfy the users' Quality of Experience (QoE) requirements. Our major contribution in this paper includes: (1) designing a joint source-channel-authentication coding framework for color-depth-based 3D video transmission; (2) proposing a media quality prediction model for color-depth-based 3D video transmission; (3) developing optimization for graph-based authentication on 3D video transmission to improve reconstructed media quality, reduce authentication overheads and energy consumption.

Companion screens provide access to auxiliary content that may, or may not, be related to the content presented on the main screen. The watching experience is personalized to the individual or specific group that is watching television. Providing independent content recommendations is essential in such a future, in order to cover the full range of content sources, platforms types and group personalization available in an HBB-Next system. This article analyses how independent content recommendations can be provided, both in technology and business terms. Three open domain models provide views on the HBB-Next ecosystem, highlighting content-provider, platform and recommendation-provider independence. High-level technical requirements and API functionalities are derived from these domain models.

Therefore, MANET can be flexibly and simply deployed in almost any environment. But it has a limited wireless coverage and limited connectivity that is exclusive to the MANET boundary. The growth of the Internet and its services and applications and the trend in fourth generation (4G) wireless networks toward full-IP networks, lead to an increasing demand for enabling MANET nodes to connect to Internet and use its services and applications. Mobile IP and IP micro-mobility protocols enable the mobile host to access Internet and change points of attachment without losing the connection. So, with the cooperation between MANET routing protocols and IP mobility protocol, Internet connectivity to MANET nodes can be achieved. In this paper, we propose integrated network architecture to extend the cellular IP access network to multiple MANETs. We also propose an integration routing protocol for connecting MANET to cellular IP Access network and Internet.

We consider the authentication as a service that should be required by each user in order to gain access to the network and to the offered services. Instead of using a unique channel to transmit the messages of the authentication service as in the case of the legacy DSRC model, our scheme extends this latter through exploiting the various DSRC channels based on a channel sensing approach that aims to prioritize the transmission of the authentication messages (with respect to the transmission of other DSRC services messages of the same priority as the authentication service). We implemented our proposed solution under the GrooveNet vehicular network simulator, where we analyze its performance impact on a previously proposed vehicular network authentication mechanism. Extensive simulations show the success of our proposed scheme in providing a more efficient and robust authentication in the presence of other services' traffics.	authentication;simulation	Christian Tchepnda;Hassnaa Moustafa;Houda Labiod;Gilles Bourdon	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications	10.1109/WiMob.2008.9	communications protocol;throughput;telecommunications;computer science;information security;network interface;authentication protocol;dedicated short-range communications;authentication;computer security;bandwidth;computer network	Mobile	-9.282488018060683	90.99317539794535	30781

The problem addressed more specifically here is the design of a responsive mechanism for rate allocation in each layer, that would guarantee the best bandwidth usage for all the receivers. One key features, in contrast with existing solutions, are an optimization of th e overall PSNR seen by the receivers instead of a measure of goodput. A second key feature is that the optimization does not have to be carried out on the network nodes but only by the sender. Only feedback mergers have to be supported by some nodes in the network leading to a clustering of the receivers according to their bottleneck rate of the rate they a r allowed following some TCP-friendliness criteria.	cluster analysis;goodput;mathematical optimization;multicast;network congestion;peak signal-to-noise ratio	Fabrice Le Léannec;Jérôme Viéron;Xavier Henocq;Christine Guillemot	2000		10.1109/ICIP.2000.899488	data compression;transmitter;real-time computing;multicast;telecommunications;computer science;noise;transport layer;visual communication;computer network	Mobile	-5.032045563685906	99.57312025521358	30802

Both SMS and Email have been widely used for messaging in wireless and fixed networks respectively, but none of these is capable enough to fulfill the present and the future demands of wireless messaging. None of the existing messaging systems can also take full advantages of the recent technological advancements in wireless communications. MMS has been designed both in 3GPP and WAP Forum to overcome the known limitations and shortcomings of the existing messaging systems. MMS utilizes the capabilities provided by WAP, GPRS and 3G, which offer efficient use of radio resources and improved connectivity. This paper makes an analysis over MMS by pointing out its features and functionalities. Architecture, message structure, encoding, information flow and transport of MMS come gradually under scrutiny in this paper both from standardization and implementation point of views to find feasibility of MMS in the target wireless infrastructure. According to the comparative study made in this paper, MMS is not only equipped with the positive features of existing messaging systems, but also with some new ones. A predictive study is also made in this paper to outline different expected MMS-based services.	authentication;digital camera;download;email;end-to-end principle;information flow;instant messaging;inter-process communication;person of interest;screensaver;server (computing);vii	Miraj-E.

This paper proposes a Fast Threshold Spread Model (FTSM) to predict the future access pattern of multi-media content based on the social information of its past viewers.

In the Web-caching field, researchers have proposed to realize DiffServ on Web servers, cache servers, and the client. We argue that there are significant advantages of implementing DiffServ on edge routers in a distributed Web caching system. Edge routers can perform request classification, and assign the type of service, hence the per-hop behavior of the classified requests. If the edge router has knowledge of each cache server, then the edge router is able to provide quality of service to different requests by forwarding the requests to the most appropriate cache server. We propose a switching-based differentiated service aching scheme that provides different types of service to three classes of requests, namely streaming class, real-time assured class and best-effort class. A detailed simulation model is described and then used to examine the conditions under which our scheme is able to satisfy the service requirements of the three classes.	best-effort delivery;differentiated service;differentiated services;microsoft edge;per-hop behaviour;quality of service;real-time clock;requirement;router (computing);server (computing);simulation;type of service;web cache;web service;world wide web	Jian Zhou;Patrick Martin;Hossam S.

However, the perceptron has some limitations such as non- optimization for several targets. Therefore, this paper proposes to develop the perceptron with fuzzy control approach to eliminate the limitation of perceptron and enhance the capability of perceptron.	load balancing (computing);neuron;quality of service	Sanon Chimmanee;Komwut Wipusitwarakun;Suwan Runggeratigul	2003		10.1007/978-3-540-45224-9_73	real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Metrics	-5.054140068074571	95.46832975338694	31908

From an application point of view, it is obvious that nodes (users) will only setup connections with a specific goal, i.e., in order to use services and resources that are available in or reachable through the ad hoc network. Consequently, resource and service discovery protocols that allow nodes to learn about the available services in the network are indispensable. In this paper, we compare the performance of two basic decentralized resource and service discovery techniques, namely proactive and reactive discovery, through simulations and theoretical analysis. Our results show that the choice between them is not straightforward. It highly depends on the network and service characteristics and on the interaction with the underlying routing protocols. Therefore, our analysis provides protocol developers with some guidelines for developing new or extending existing resource and service discovery protocols for operation in mobile ad hoc networks. In addition, concrete suggestions for developing an integrated adaptive multi-mode solution for both resource and service discovery and routing in mobile ad hoc networks are presented.	service discovery	Jeroen Hoebeke;Ingrid Moerman;Bart Dhoedt;Piet Demeester	2006	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2006.01.025	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless routing protocol;web service;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;the internet;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;operating system;wireless network;ad hoc wireless distribution service;geocast;analysis;distributed computing;service discovery;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;mobile computing;decentralization;computer security;computer network;data transmission	Mobile	-13.493715015394274	95.66316680824481	31955
a61dcb842da1a82932d094b0e8e289e7c99384a3	a comprehensive analysis of swarming-based live streaming to leverage client heterogeneity		Due to missing IP multicast support on an Internet scale, over-the-top media streams are delivered with the help of overlays as used by content delivery networks and their peer-to-peer (P2P) extensions. In this context, mesh/pull-based swarming plays an important role either as pure streaming approach or in combination with tree/push mechanisms. However, the impact of realistic client populations with heterogeneous resources is not yet fully understood. In this technical report, we contribute to closing this gap by mathematically analysing the most basic scheduling mechanisms latest deadline first (LDF) and earliest deadline first (EDF) in a continuous time Markov chain framework and combining them into a simple, yet powerful, mixed strategy to leverage inherent differences in client resources. The main contributions are twofold: (1) a mathematical framework for swarming on random graphs is proposed with a focus on LDF and EDF strategies in heterogeneous scenarios; (2) a mixed strategy, named SchedMix, is proposed that leverages peer heterogeneity. The proposed strategy, SchedMix is shown to outperform the other two strategies using different abstractions: a mean-field theoretic analysis of buffer probabilities, simulations of a stochastic model on random graphs, and a full-stack implementation of a P2P streaming system.

689494293732eaed0aea50ee1adb9e501418715f	on the http segment streaming potentials and performance improvements	doctoral thesis	"""Video streaming has gone a long way from its early years in the 90’s. Today, the prevailing technique to stream live and video on demand (VoD) content is adaptive HTTP segment streaming as used by the solutions from for example Apple, Microsoft, and Adobe. The reasons are its simple deployment and management. The HTTP infrastructure, including HTTP proxies, caches and in general Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), is already deployed. Furthermore, HTTP is the de facto standard protocol of the Internet and is therefore allowed to pass through most firewalls and Network Address Translation (NAT) devices. The goal of this thesis is to investigate the possible uses of adaptive HTTP segment streaming beyond the classical linear streaming and to look at ways to make HTTP servers dealing with HTTP segment streaming traffic more efficient. In addition to the deployment and management benefits, the segmentation of video opens new application possibilities. In this thesis, we investigate those first. For example, we demonstrate on the fly creation of custom video playlists containing only content relevant to a user query. Using user surveys, we show, that it not only saves time to automatically get playlists created from relevant video excerpts, but the user experience increases significantly as well. However, already the basic capabilities of HTTP segment streaming, i.e., streaming of live and on demand video, are very popular and are creating a huge amount of network traffic. Our analysis of logs provided by a Norwegian streaming provider Comoyo indicates that a substantial amount of the traffic data must be served from places other than the origin server. Since a substantial part of the traffic comes from places other than the origin server, it is important that effective and efficient use of resources not only takes place on the origin server, but also on other, possibly HTTP segment streaming unaware servers. The HTTP segment streaming unaware servers handle segment streaming data as any other type of web data (HTML pages, images, CSS files, javascript files etc.). It is important to look at how the effectiveness of data delivery from this kind of servers can be improved, because there might be potentially many """"off the shelf"""" servers serving video segments (be it a homemade solution or an HTTP streaming-unaware CDN server). In general, there are three possible places to improve the situation: on the server, in the network and on the client. To improve the situation in the network between the server and the client is generally impossible for a streaming provider. Improving things on the server is possible, but difficult because the serving server might be out of the control of the streaming provider. Best chances are to improve things on the client. Therefore, the major part of this thesis deals with the proposal and evaluation of different modifications to the client-side and only some light modifications to the server-side. In particular, the thesis looks at two types of bottlenecks that can occur. The thesis shows how to deal with a client-side bottleneck using multiple links. In this context, we propose and evaluate a scheduler for partial segment requests. After that, we discuss different techniques on how to deal with a server-side bottleneck with for example different modifications on the transport layer (TCP congestion control variant, TCP Congestion Window [1] (CWND) limitation) and the application layer (the encoding of segments, segment request strategy). The driving force behind many of these modifications is the on-off traffic pattern that HTTP segment streaming traffic exhibits. The on-off traffic leads in many cases of live streaming to request synchronization as explained in this thesis. The synchronization in turn leads to increased packet loss and hence to a downgrade of throughput, which exhibits itself by decreased segment bitrate, i.e., lower quality of experience. We find that distributing client requests over time by means of a different client request strategy yields good results in terms of quality and the number of clients a server can handle. Other modifications like the limiting of the CWND or using a different congestion control algorithm can also help in many cases. All in all, this thesis explores the potentials of adaptive HTTP segment streaming beyond the linear video streaming and it explores the possibilities to increase the performance of HTTP segment streaming servers."""	algorithm;best practice;bottleneck (software);cascading style sheets;client-side;content delivery network;downgrade;firewall (computing);html;hypertext transfer protocol;javascript;network address translation;network congestion;network packet;network traffic control;on the fly;scheduling (computing);server (computing);server-side;software deployment;streaming media;switch;tcp congestion control;throughput;user experience	Tomas Kupka	2013		10.1145/2518140.2518146	speech recognition;telecommunications;computer science	Metrics	-7.442945172946381	97.56284322990308	32372

In this article we report on a database containing subjective assessment scores and the corresponding Quality-of-Service parameters of 70 video test sequences encoded with H.264, which are corrupted when transmitted over a wireless 3G LTE network simulator. Then, a new assessment method based on neural networks (NN) is proposed, whose weights are determined through training. The resulting pseudo-subjective assessment scores are then compared to the true MOS results in our database. Naturally, the accuracy of the NN-based prediction tool should be tested `outside' of the set used for NN weight training. However, there are persistent residual errors between the predicted and subjectively evaluated MOS, which can be further reduced by particle swarm optimization, applied as post-processing of the NN weights to improve its accuracy. The proposed assessment method has potential applications, including Quality-of-Experience-aware network optimization for LTE network operators.	artificial neural network;compaq lte;flow network;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;human body weight;mathematical optimization;particle swarm optimization;quality of service;video post-processing	Kan Zheng;Xiaoli Zhang;Qiang Zheng;Wei Xiang;Lajos Hanzo Hanzo	2015	IEEE Wireless Communications	10.1109/MWC.2015.7054721	data compression;simulation;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;multimedia;particle swarm optimization;artificial neural network;computer network	Vision	-9.211602171240052	100.8756429658552	32430

Our system virtually places participants of a telephone conference to different positions around the listeners by using Head Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs), which helps to identify active speakers in an audio conference. Intelligibility of communication is also increased by making use of the cocktail party effect which helps to concentrate on one specific participant, even if there are more simultaneously active speakers. To support regular telephone systems, we focus in particular on compatibility to existing Voice over IP (VoIP) infrastructure by using standardized protocols like the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP). Both traditional telephone devices and software clients are put into one heterogeneous conference. While the conference server transmits the down-mixed, mono single-channel conference signal to regular phones, the software clients can receive a stereo-signal enabling full 3D audio.	backward compatibility;convolution;head-related transfer function;intelligibility (philosophy);mobile phone;powered speakers;real-time transcription;server (computing)	Martin Rothbucher;Matthias Kaufmann;Tim Habigt;Johannes Feldmaier;Klaus Diepold	2011	2011 Seventh International Conference on Signal Image Technology & Internet-Based Systems	10.1109/SITIS.2011.35	embedded system;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;head-related transfer function;voice over ip;database;computer security	Robotics	-21.936818637500835	94.02230593516396	32473

In addition, the traditional broadcasting service has advanced into a smart media with the help of communication network and information technology. However, terrestrial broadcasters comparatively lag behind new players in spite of their powerful contents and stable terrestrial media delivery networks. In this paper, we consider system requirement of terrestrial UHDTV broadcasting service and propose system architecture of the UHDTV media platform based on a set-top-box (STB) with various new functions. Also, we suggest specific transmission network architecture and platform components for UHD broadcasting service. The proposed media platform is expected to increase the number of direct receiving households and to enhance the rights of the free-viewers, which is one of the natural missions of terrestrial broadcasters. Also, it can provide some profit models of UHD terrestrial broadcasting service with new value-added services.	media ecology;multimedia framework;network architecture;ruby document format;set-top box;smartmedia;system requirements;systems architecture;telecommunications network;terrestrial television	Jai-Pil Oh;Dong Ho Kim	2015	IJSN	10.1504/IJSN.2015.070413	simulation;terrestrial television;telecommunications;computer science;multimedia;systems architecture	Mobile	-16.96979435057793	94.60099890833622	32666
72b15e030aff4b78bb26335ad1eb0bbd3b60583c	enhancing service provisioning within heterogeneous wireless networks for emergency situations		Emergency situations where lives are at stake, such as natural disasters, accidents, or serious fire, require low reaction times. Especially in sparsely populated areas the distance between the nearest emergency station and its disaster location may be quite large. In order to minimize reaction times, emergency communication is to be prioritized with respect to other network services. For enabling efficient and privileged usage of available network resources for emergency services, we propose to handle diverse service requests, ranging from emergency voice calls to bandwidth-consuming streaming services for emergency news, collaboratively by a Joint Call Admision Control (JCAC) and Dynamic Bandwidth Adaptation (DBA) approach. Therefore, we introduce a novel utility definition of services. It represents a generic measurement of the provided level of importance of the emergency service with respect to the common utility, i.e. the utility of service provisioning for the population. The designed JCAC and DBA algorithms cooperatively manage resources of heterogeneous wireless networks and aim at supporting a maximum number of requested services. Further, system utilization is optimized by improving the QoS characteristics of the already granted, elastic services. Simulation results show an improvement in the overall gained utility for emergency services compared to other research approaches.	algorithm;assignment problem;blocking (computing);population;provisioning;quality of service;requirement;simulation	Christian Lottermann;Andreas Klein;Hans D.

However, due of the lack of suitable mechanisms to provide scalable and efficient support for IP-based charging and billing, the commercialization of the Internet has only been progressing slowly. Such IP-based charging and billing support is crucial to the overall success of a commercialized wireless IP-based network as aspired in 4G. Within the IETF, both an IP-based metering framework and an AAA architecture dealing with authentication, authorization and accounting have been developed which targets the missing functions and mechanisms. Although the basic mechanisms are available and widely understood, their efficient and scalable integration into a mobile environment is still an open point.

Many personal and industrial business use cases assume the availability of perpetual Internet access for fulfillment. The access to the Internet, ironically, is expensive, given various tiered pricing models that Internet Service Providers (ISP) employ. In many developing economies, the availability of the Internet is very sporadic, or only can be afford by a few. The enablement of free Internet access, Wi-Fi access points, in developing economies is huge business opportunity for ISPs.

Mobile WiMAX has enabled convergence of mobile and fixed broadband networks through a common wide-area radio-access technology and flexible network architecture. Since January 2007, the IEEE 802.16 working group has been developing a new amendment of the IEEE 802.16 standard (i.e., IEEE 802.16m) as an advanced air interface to meet the requirements of ITU-R/IMT-advanced for 4G systems, as well as for the next-generation mobile network operators. Depending on the available bandwidth and multi-antenna mode, the next-generation mobile WiMAX will be capable of over-the-air data-transfer rates in excess of 1 Gb/s and of supporting a wide range of high-quality and high-capacity IP-based services and applications while maintaining full backward compatibility with the existing mobile WiMAX systems to preserve investments and continuing to support first-generation products. This tutorial describes the prominent technical features of IEEE 802.16m and the potential for successful deployment of the next generation of mobile WiMAX in 2011+.

Its three key aims are to let us test technologies for every aspect of communications, provide very wide bandwidth that can accommodate very fast applications without any restraints, and promote collaboration with other research networks. We are using DWDM/CWDM technologies to build multiple OC48 and GbE circuits between NTT's R&D centres in Musashino, Yokosuka and Atsugi and collaborative national research institutes including NII, NICT and NAOJ. GEMnet2 is also connected to SINET and Abilene with OC48 circuits to facilitate international experiments requiring very wide bandwidth.	abilene paradox;experiment;national information infrastructure;optical carrier transmission rates;requirement;testbed;wavelength-division multiplexing	Hisao Uose	2005	First International Conference on Testbeds and Research Infrastructures for the DEvelopment of NeTworks and COMmunities	10.1109/TRIDNT.2005.19	information and communications technology;simulation;scientific method;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;information system;wavelength-division multiplexing;computer network	EDA	-19.853992167541755	91.15726954282444	33144

We call the proposed framework Erasable Packets within Internet Queues (EPIQ). EPIQ exhibits best-effort complexity within the network, similar to the networking complexity of HTTP-based Adaptive Streaming (HAS); yet EPIQ can provide optimal quality-of-experience performance similar to the performance of high-complexity multi-queue solutions. EPIQ exploits the inherent multi-priority nature of video to deliver optimal quality-of-experience without requiring any additional overhead in terms of redundant packets or network resources such as multiple queues and without the need to maintain state information about flows. The novelty of EPIQ is rooted in its packetization. Each EPIQ packet consists of multiple segments, and where each segment carries different priority video content. Under congestion, a network router can simply partially erase only small portions of the EPIQ packets instead of dropping complete packets. We show through an analytical model and extensive simulations that this new paradigm in video streaming provides significant improvements over HAS solutions in terms of quality-of-experience metrics. These significant improvements are achieved while maintaining fairness, stability, and low-complexity within the network.	active queue management;best-effort delivery;digital video;fairness measure;hypertext transfer protocol;network congestion;network packet;overhead (computing);programming paradigm;router (computing);simulation;streaming media	Hothaifa Al-Qassab;Hayder Radha	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia & Expo Workshops (ICMEW)	10.1109/ICMEW.2016.7574689	real-time computing;the internet;quality of service;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Metrics	-5.164319645517199	95.7801685901784	33158

Dynamic mobility anchoring (DMA) mechanism distributes the mobility management functions using such network architecture. In this paper, we compare DMA with a classical mobility protocol like proxy mobile IP (PMIP). A major cost factor of a mobility protocol is the management of contexts and tunnels. We propose an analytical model to compute the number of contexts and tunnels with DMA and with PMIP in a homogeneous network with random mobility of mobile nodes. The model is used under different configurations by varying the traffic loads and the capacities of access nodes in order to analyze the distributed and dynamic characteristics of DMA. The results show that the required number of contexts on an anchor node with DMA is significantly less than that required on an anchor node with PMIP and the required number of visitor contexts with DMA is significantly less in magnitude than that with PMIP for most of the configurations. The results also show that the number of required tunnels with DMA is less than those required with PMIP for most configurations.	profiling (computer programming)	Kashif Munir;Xavier Lagrange;Philippe Bertin;Karine Guillouard;Meryem Ouzzif	2015	Telecommunication Systems	10.1007/s11235-014-9957-5	cellular network;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;direct memory access;computer network	Metrics	-9.425069643985369	89.89723598902592	33183

As major feature, presence information is transferred when mobile users get in direct contact, similar to the spread of an infections disease. By exploiting node mobility, presence information is epidemically distributed throughout the network, effectively overcoming network partitions. We show how to apply the Passive Distributed Indexing Protocol, which implements a general-purpose lookup service for mobile applications building upon epidemic data dissemination, for implementing the exchange of presence information. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated in a simulation study using the network simulator ns-2. Building upon the results, we present the architecture of a mobile instant messaging system that supports the widely adopted Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), an IETF standardized protocol for instant messaging.	general-purpose markup language;hoc (programming language);instant messaging;inter-process communication;java;lookup table;mobile app;portable database image;presence information;prototype;server (computing);simulation;software prototyping	Christoph Lindemann;Oliver P.

However, media distribution is not ready yet to satisfy users' quality expectations, especially in wireless networks. That is why a number of quality of service (QoS) mechanisms have to be deployed in the network in order to guarantee a certain level of quality. We propose a user-centric QoS management approach based on user preferences. Unlike traditional QoS approaches that always give multimedia applications a pre-determined high priority due to their strict latency and loss requirements, the proposed approach classifies traffic according to user preferences, thus, ensuring a certain quality regardless of the application requirements. The application priorities are assigned according to user profiles and automatically updated in case of changes in the network or user environment. The paper suggests that the introduced management approach will significantly contribute to the overall user experience in digital home.	digital recording;home automation;quality of service;requirement;user (computing);user experience;user interface;user profile	Aleksej Spenst;Thorsten Herfet	2007	2007 IEEE 9th Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing	10.1109/MMSP.2007.4412905	user experience design;computer science;wireless network;internet privacy;world wide web;computer network	Web+IR	-11.118613522854796	99.73479734114082	33799

The proposed location management schemes assume a hierarchy of location areas, which might change dynamically with changing traac patterns. A method to compute this hierarchical tree is also proposed. Depending on the proole of the user movements for the last time units, the most probable (and the future probable) location areas are computed for the user in the basic scheme and its rst variant. The second variant predicts the location probabilities of the user in the future cells combining them with those already traversed in the last time units to form the most probable location area. The third variant is a hybrid of the rst and second variants. Finally, the proposed heuristics are validated by extensive simulation of a real time cellular mobile system, where all the four schemes are compared under various traac patterns.	care-of address;egress filtering;heuristic (computer science);hierarchical network model;mobile phone;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;server (computing);simulation	Sajal K.

However, there are difficulties in providing the guaranteed service in terms of end-to-end systems since a differentiated-services network considers the quality of service of traffic aggregates due to the scalability. Furthermore, since the quality of service level may be time varying according to the network conditions in the case of the relative service model, it is more difficult to provide guaranteed end-to-end service when the path between two end systems includes several domains. Therefore, we study dynamic class selection mechanisms to guarantee the end-to-end quality of service for continuous media traffic with minimum networking cost over multiple differentiated-services domains.	differentiated services;end-to-end principle;internet;quality of service;scalability	Dai Boong Lee;Hwangjun Song	2004	2004 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME) (IEEE Cat.

In order to determine the required QoS, both the identity of the client as well as the URL being accessed are used. To provide end-to-end service guarantees, it is not sufficient to provide QoS in the network layer or in the web server alone. QoS should be monitored and enforced in both components and the two managers must communicate and cooperate. Nowadays, web servers are not restricted to doling out static web documents, but usually execute some code for each HTTP request. The IQM determines the necessary QoS such that this execution is done within the specified deadline. The IQM is aware of network latency associated with each host and for each DiffServ marking, since ignorance about this delay can lead to deadlines being missed when the network load is high. We also show how dynamic DiffServ marking can help under high traffic conditions.	differentiated service;differentiated services;end-to-end principle;item unique identification;quality of service;server (computing);web page;web server	Chen-Khong Tham;V.

MN can handover relatively faster in PMIPv6 than in Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) because it actively uses link-layer attachment information and reduces the movement detection time, and eliminates duplicate address detection procedure. However, the current PMIPv6 cannot prevent packet loss during the handover period. We propose the Smart Buffering scheme for seamlessness in PMIPv6. The Smart Buffering scheme prevents packet loss by proactively buffering packets that will be lost in a current serving mobile access gateway (MAG) by harnessing network-side information only. It also performs redundant packet elimination and packet reordering to minimize duplicate packet delivery and disruption of connection-oriented flows. To fetch buffered packets from a previous MAG, a new MAG discovers the previous MAG by using a discovery mechanism without any involvement of an MN. We verified the effectiveness of Smart Buffering via simulation with various parameters.

On the basis of the characteristics of the two networks, we can see that they are complementary. If we can integrate the most popular technologies of these two kinds of networks, the integration will result in a new, attractive network access method. From the viewpoints of both the user and the service provider, the advantages of the integration include increased profits and better support for services. However, the integration of the two heterogeneous networks still presents many problems, the most critical of which concern authentication and billing. In this paper, we propose a practical, efficient, and secure authentication, authorization, and accounting mechanism within the interworking architecture proposed by Third Generation Partnership Project 3GPP.

The system is implemented in a testbed where QoS parameters like One Way Delay (OWD), packet loss, jitter and ITU's R-factor are measured.

c7a210e8dfbeced14d1ff3cb7f7573f678cb2d55	a congestion control middleware layer with dynamic bandwidth management for satellite communications	tcp;cooperative;congestion control;satellite;middleware	Historically, satellites have been set aside for what regards Internet connectivity; however, the interest in their usage to provide Internet connectivity is now rising again. Because of the growing demand for Internet services around the world, satellites can be an effective medium to serve scarcely populated areas as well as missioncritical communications. While the standard transmission control protocol (TCP) performs badly when employed on satellite links for the high propagation delay, when a number of client hosts are wirelessly connected to a gateway that forwards and receives traffic across such links, the major limit is represented by the channel condition estimation performed by the TCP through loss detection and/or acknowledgement-based timing information. This paper proposes congestion control middleware layer (C 2MLC), a centralized and collaborative middleware with dynamic bandwidth management, that aims to improve performance and QoS for TCP flows in the aforementioned scenarios. Results of ns-3 simulations show an improvement in aggregate throughput, a significant reduction of latencies because of low queues occupancy levels, and higher fairness and friendliness guarantees among flows. They also confirm that C 2MLC allows a dynamic and efficient usage of the bottleneck link, avoiding a waste of resources when some client nodes are unable to fully exploit their transmission potential.

The trend towards similar applications is further accelerated by increasing number of mobile devices used to consume high resolution video and interact with low latency. Hence, new challenges arise that can no longer be solved by solely altering the network's edge. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and its most popular incarnation OpenFlow [1] cause a trend towards intelligent devices at the network's core. The end-to-end (E2E) principle, as proposed by Saltzer et al. [2] in 1984 and further discussed by Moors [3] in 2002, is one of the paradigms to be reconsidered in this new world. Theory and practice show that segmenting multiple transmission domains can provide benefits for the overall network performance. Current approaches, as e.g. Split-TCP [4], require changes to the end-hosts and applications to explicitly use this protocol, which can be avoided when using SDN technologies. We propose the novel networking pattern Transparent Transmission Segmentation (TTS) that allows to separate certain domains and lead to better performance, especially in heterogeneous environments. With most of multimedia streaming traffic being transmitted using Dynamic Adaptive Streaming (DASH) [5], it is straightforward to consider TCP transmissions. We identify network functions of TCP that can perform better when segmentation is employed and give a differentiated view on this using simulations measuring transmission times. The evaluation shows that although we have performance degradations of maximally 1% for mean, median and standard deviation for certain scenarios, our approach can achieve more than 14% improvement on certain scenarios and 3 - 10% on most scenarios. This shows that TTS has to be applied thoughtfully, but can provide significant improvements when employed in the scenarios with high loss and jitter.	end-to-end principle;image resolution;integrated development environment;internet;mobile device;netware file system;network congestion;network performance;openflow;programming paradigm;relay;simulation;software-defined networking;streaming media;transmission (bittorrent client)	Andreas Schmidt;Thorsten Herfet	2016	2016 IEEE 6th International Conference on Consumer Electronics - Berlin (ICCE-Berlin)	10.1109/ICCE-Berlin.2016.7684735	real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications;computer science	Networks	-7.092276256522293	98.21671778203309	34979

Six different data sets are used in the study: three from academic environments, two from scientific research organizations, and one from a commercial Internet provider. These data sets represent three different orders of magnitude in server activity, and two different orders of magnitude in time duration, ranging from one week of activity to one year. The workload characterization focuses on the document type distribution, the document size distribution, the document referencing behavior, and the geographic distribution of server requests. Throughout the study, emphasis is placed on finding workload characteristics that are common to all the data sets studied. Ten such characteristics are identified. The paper concludes with a discussion of caching and performance issues, using the observed workload characteristics to suggest performance enhancements that seem promising for Internet Web servers.	cache (computing);internet;server (computing);web application;web server	Martin F.

This growing demand for high quality video services can cause problems in current communication networks. For this reason, the characterization and modeling of video workloads have become essential factors in evaluating the performance of these services. This paper presents the implementation of a simulation model of a Video on Demand (VoD) service. The model takes into account both the behavior of the users and the server workload. While the former is analyzed through a real VoD service, the latter is analyzed through lab experiments. Nevertheless, the main contribution of our model is that it also considers the dependences among user interactions. The model has been validated using real data and evaluated in different situations. Results show that performance is influenced both by massive access to the contents and by the dependence structure of user interactions. 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In many scenarios the tariff rates used increase with the speed of the access channel. Next generation networks will offer higher data rates. Users will not get incentives to utilise the extra capacity if current tariff structures are retained. In this paper, a novel, network congestion dependent dynamic billing scheme is proposed. Differentially priced network service profiles are introduced, and the use of DiffServ and connection admission control for QoS provisioning is explored. A hybrid billing scheme is designed.

UDDI extension for WSRP enables the discovery and access to user facing web services provided by business partners while eliminating the need to design local user facing portlets. Most importantly, the remote portlets can be updated by web service providers from their own servers. Remote portlet consumers are not required to make any changes in their portals to accommodate updated remote portlets. This approach results in easier team development, upgrades, administration, low cost development and usage of shared resources. Furthermore, with the growing interest in SOA, WSRP should cooperate with service bus (ESB).In this paper, the author examines the technical underpinning of the UDDI extensions for WSRP (user facing remote web services) and their role in service sharing among business partners. The author also briefly outlines the architectural view of using WSRP in enterprise integration tasks and the role Enterprise Service Bus (ESB). conveniently consume the services and use them without any programming effort. Furthermore, Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) can be used to create controlled messaging environment, thus enabling lightweight connectivity. During the architectural design involving WSRP we have to consider several design issues associated with usage of currently web technologies: • Cookies handling, cookies protocol • URL rewriting rules • Ajax and security handling In the following section we will discuss each of these topics and where possible, suggest the solution approach and highlight architectural points which would need special attention in the design.

Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited. Cookies HandlinG Cookies are commonly used in any web application. WSRP standard does not prescribe strictly how cookies should be handled thus introducing possible “disagreement” between the WSRP Consumer and Producer. These discrepancies are handled by WSRP extensions (WSRP 2.0 Portlet Specification, 2006). There have been several different approaches taken by Consumer implementations of how cookies sent to the Consumer are stored and distributed. The key difference is the distribution scope of a cookie set via a Set-Cookie response header during a markup operation other than initCookie() (getMarkup(), performBlockingInteraction(), handleEvents(), getResource()) (Polgar Jana, 2009). The WSRP extension enables the Producer to discover the method the Consumer uses to handle cookies (the actual protocol) and may allow the Producer to amend its behavior accordingly. In IBM WebSphere Portal Server cookies that the Consumer receives are stored in the Consumer session. They are later forwarded in requests to remote portlets. The portal also handles cookies set by resources that are served by the WSRP Consumer as a proxy. They are served by the WSRP Consumer as a proxy according to the standard cookie matching and expiry rules. The two distribution schemes have been proposed: • RFC2109 Cookies are sent to any Producer (and its portlets) that matches the domain and path attributes of the SetCookie header (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/ rfc2109.txt) • Use of Producer Cookie Protocol which restricts who can receive the cookies (rule is that Cookies are only sent to the originating Producer and portlets which match the Producer’s Cookie Protocol in the service description. (http://docs.oasisopen.org/wsrp/v2/wsrp-2.0-spec-os-01. html#_CookieProtocol) The proposal in the WSRP extension so far suggests to tie portlet cookies to the transport level similar to Producer managed cookies as a plain HTTP state mechanism. Cookies should be transferred and managed at the transport level. This approach has already been introduced in the earlier specification 1.0 and does not require any need for a change.

Data networks are known of their peaky and bursty responses and profiles over their usage. During network operation at peak times, where a network interface is fully utilized, devices can no more send or receive data and the users will face traffic congestion and server crashes. Therefore, Internet Service Providers, aim at making the most out of their share of bandwidth, because of the high cost of resources. In this paper, we implemented algorithms that allow flattening the utilization profile of network resources by optimizing network resources. In addition, we tested various scheduling techniques to reduce the effect of traffic delays resulted by the flattening algorithms. All the simulations were conducted in discrete time in the theme of bandwidth Demand Side Management.	algorithm;mathematical optimization;network congestion;network interface;noise shaping;program optimization;scheduling (computing);server (computing);simulation;traffic shaping	Ahmed M.

Maintaining the session of all the nodes in mobile network with its home network and external nodes can be provided by the basic Network Mobility support protocol. It provides mobility at IP level to complete networks, allowing a Mobile Network to change its point of attachment to the Internet, while maintaining the ongoing sessions of the nodes of the network. The Mobile Router (MR) manages the mobility even though the nodes don’t know the status of mobility. This article discusses few basic concepts and limitations of NEMO protocol and proposes two ways to optimize the NEMO routing technique for registered and unregistered Correspondent Nodes (CN) of the Mobile Network Node (MNN).	attachments;internet;proxy mobile ipv6;router (computing);routing	M.

Despite gaming's significant implications for the Internet, no general framework exists for validating various and sometimes contradicting game traffic models. Practitioners must therefore find and study dozens of reports and papers, some with conflicting measurements, to understand traffic characteristics and use this information in their systems. This survey looks at the most representative first-person shooter (FPS) game traffic to provide a one-stop shop for practitioners.	floating point systems;internet	Saurabh Ratti;Behnoosh Hariri;Shervin Shirmohammadi	2010	IEEE Internet Computing	10.1109/MIC.2010.57	games;active traffic management;the internet;simulation;internet traffic;computer science;virtual machine;distributed computing;multimedia;computer applications;data analysis;law;world wide web;computer security;information system;computer network	Metrics	-13.212213097239191	98.70369193527017	37007

Assuming that such services have been provided with all the necessary service orchestration and end user information, simple services may be enhanced with contextual information, such as location, presence and user preferences, to provide a more tailored experience for the end user. Mobile next generation service environments include many functional components suitable for the provision of contextual data with which to build tailored and complex services for subscribers. Specifically, the IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) defined by 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and its enablers provide an interesting environment for researching techniques for the composition and delivery of complex context-specific personalized and community services to mobile users. In this paper we discuss our ongoing research into dynamic service composition for mobile communities. As such, we investigate community-based mobile entertainment services, their provisioning requirements, enablers, and dynamic composition of group-specific real-time next generation packet mobile services.

HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) technologies, e.g., Apple HLS or MPEG-DASH, automatically adapt the delivered video quality to the available network. This reduces stalling of the video but additionally introduces quality switches, which also influence the user-perceived Quality of Experience (QoE). In this work, we conduct a subjective study to identify the impact of adaptation parameters on QoE. The results indicate that the video quality has to be maximized first, and that the number of quality switches is less important. Based on these results, a method to compute the optimal QoE-optimal adaptation strategy for HAS on a per user basis with mixed-integer linear programming is presented. This QoE-optimal adaptation enables the benchmarking of existing adaptation algorithms for any given network condition. Moreover, the investigated concept is extended to a multi-user IPTV scenario. The question is answered whether video quality, and thereby, the QoE can be shared in a fair manner among the involved users.	computation;computer networks (journal);distributed algorithm;download;dynamic programming;fairness measure;hypertext transfer protocol;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;microsoft outlook for mac;multi-user;network switch;scenario (computing);streaming media;systems architecture;titcoin;user interface;video clip	Tobias Hoßfeld;Michael Seufert;Christian Sieber;Thomas Zinner;Phuoc Tran-Gia	2015	Computer Networks	10.1016/j.comnet.2015.02.015	real-time computing;simulation;computer science;multimedia;computer network	Comp.	-8.144730055128953	98.91082438494281	37036

The former parameters are called availability parameters and the latter are called QoR parameters. In one hand by dividing the service duration time into intervals, the service is considered available during a time interval, if the Service Level Agreement (SLA) between the user and the network operator is satisfied. In the other hand the long-term characteristics of the service are derived from the service downtime distribution. With the downtime histograms the asymptotic characteristics of the service can be represented both at the transport and service layers. Since the resilience mechanism implemented into the network match the transport layer downtime histograms, this new characterization of the QoS helps to measure the impacts of a given recovery scheme on the next generation services.	atm turbo;downtime;einar thorsrud;frame relay;multiplexing;multiprotocol label switching;network architecture;network topology;next-generation network;quality of service;service-level agreement;subject matter expert turing test	János Tapolcai;Piotr Cholda;Tibor Cinkler;Krzysztof Wajda;Andrzej Jajszczyk;Dominique Verchère	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2006.254841	service level objective;computer science;q factor;computer security;psychological resilience;statistics;computer network	HPC	-10.072614357704582	100.59582078987005	37149

This system uses the Army's wireless battlefield communication network to send vehicle positions as data messages. The difficulty is that, when vehicles compete to send these reports, the messages sometimes collide and this wastes valuable network capacity. At the heart of the problem is the channel access control mechanism. We show how a simple change to this mechanism can improve the system's performance significantly.		William J.

Our model gives full consideration to many new features of the H.264/AVC standard, especially intra prediction as well as inter prediction, and can be used for content-aware scheduling and performance optimization. In order to reduce complexity, the extracted information of the compressed domain from the video streams is exploited, to estimate the transmission distortion for each 4×4 block. By adding these distortions of all the 4×4 blocks in a slice up, the transmission distortion of the slice is obtained. Since the total average concealment distortion of each slice is independent on packet loss, it is introduced in the model as a known value to modify the compressed domain based transmission distortion. Simulation results show that our model outperforms the existing ones with respect to the accuracy for H.264/AVC video streams.	curve fitting;distortion;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;intra-frame coding;mathematical optimization;network packet;performance tuning;propagation of uncertainty;scheduling (computing);simulation;software propagation;streaming media	Rui Deng;Guizhong Liu	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)	10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351300	scalable video coding;real-time computing;telecommunications;rate–distortion optimization;computer network;multiview video coding	Robotics	-5.626927497525845	101.80953082438326	37260

Smartphonesmostly have both LTE andWi-Fi for data communication through Internet. Although the availability ofWi-Fi is incomparable to that of cellular network, its strength lies in the low cost and high data rate due to continuous PHY and MAC advancement of 802.11 protocol extensions. In this paper, we propose a device-centric system that performs cost-effective network connectivity to the mobile device by selectively activating Wi-Fi communication according to the device mobility and corresponding history of Wi-Fi usage. By analyzing the device mobility using attached sensors, the system selects appropriate Wi-Fi that has been often used in that mobility state.

A one-dollar decline from $20 in dial-up prices is treated as equivalent to a two-dollar decline from $40 in broadband prices. This assessment undervalues broadband revenues, because it doesn't factor in the greater satisfaction per dollar experienced by converts from dial-up to broadband.

In the proposed method, the coding rate for multimedia stream and the corresponding user percentage are taken as the controller output to adjust the cells' arrival rate to the multiplexer buffer. Compared with the previous methods where the encoding rate is regulated in a body for all multimedia streams, the proposed method not only minimize the cell loss rate but also guarantee the quality of multimedia streams into the multiplexer buffer. Furthermore, two controller structures are given. In the first controller structure, the variables in the output layers of neural networks include the continuous coding rate and the corresponding user percentage, and the continuous coding rate is quantized to be discrete value. In the second controller structure, the neural network output only include the continuous coding rate, and discrete encoding rate and the corresponding user percentage are calculated by a given formula. Simulations with 150 voice sources into the multiplexer buffer and simulations with 30 video sources into the multiplexer buffer show that the proposed method is effective in controlling congestion and maintaining the quality of the traffic.	atm turbo;artificial neural network;computer simulation;control system;data compression;multiplexer;network congestion;network interface;quantization (signal processing);queueing theory	Shu-Xin Du;Shao-Fu Han	2005	2005 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICSMC.2005.1571476	real-time computing;computer science;network interface;machine learning;asynchronous transfer mode;distributed computing;network congestion;artificial neural network;multiplexing;computer network;source code	Robotics	-4.868206435028115	99.64458270102162	37572

The convergence at the network-technology level was achieved by using the Internet protocol (IP), and therefore both integrated systems have to provide IP connectivity.

I I n t r o d u c t i o n The IEEE 802.1 I wireless L A N has been gaining great popularity for data applications in university campuses. enterprise networks and Hotspots since the baseline standard of i t was approved in 1997. During the same time, the innaxitnuin raw bandwidth o f the 802.1 I system improved greatly. fiom 2Mbps (for I I systems) to I lMbps (for I I b systems). and now up to 5JMbps (for 1 l a and I Ig systems). There are' at least two kinds of applications that are expected to take advantage of the success of the IEEE 802.1 1based WLAN technology, namely A V transmission in home netwoi-ks and Voice over IP. Both applications need very tight Quitlity o f Service (00s) support. Since the legacy 802.1 1 standard [ I ] was linable to provide adequate QoS for these applications. a new task group (TCie) in IEEE 802.1 I was initiated in September 1999 to enhance the 802.1 I M A C layer. TCie would expand support for applications with QoS requirements, and innprove the capabilities and efficiency of the protocol. while maintaining backward compatibility with the baseline 802.1 1-99 standard. After several years o f hard work. TGe overcame many political and technical challenges and generated the version 4 drati I?] and passed the letter ballot in January 2003 with a high approval rate. Based on the IEEE standard process rules, few major changes wi l l be allowed aAer the draft passes this stage. Our discussion on the I l e wi l l be based on this version of the draft. The inost likely changes in future versions wi l l be discussed as well. 2 S u m m a r y o f Legacy 802.11 MAC Layer Tlic 802.1 I M A C Layer detines two different access metliods -the Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) and the Point Coordination Function (PCF) [I]. The DCF is the fundamental access method in 802.1 I MAC, and the basis of PCF. 0-7803-7822-9/03/$17.00 02003 IEEE. 2297 2. I DCF and PCF Basically, the DCF is a Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance mechanism (CSMAKA) . In order to overcome the collision problem, the 802.1 I uses a Collision Avoidance (CA) mechanism coupled with a Positive Acknowledge scheme. A station wanting to transmit performs a backoff procedure before starting a transmission. I t has to keep sensing the channel for an additional random time after detecting the channel as being idle for a minimum duration called DCF Inter-frame Space (D/KS'). Only if the channel remains idle for this additional random time period. is the station allowed to initiate the transmission. The duration o f this random time is determined as a multiple of a slot time. Each station maintains a so-called Contention Window (CW)). which is used to determine the number o f slot times a station has to wait before transmission. Stations use the so-called """"Virtual Carrier Sense mechanism"""" based on Network Allocation Vector (NAV) together with the Physical Carrier Sense when sensing the medium, The PCF was designed to support some very basic form of QoS and maximize the utilization o f the media. Relying on the point coordinator (PC) to perform polling, the PCF enables polled stations to transmit without contending for the channel. Also. the PCF may start transmissions after a shorter duratioii than DIFS, which i s called PCF Interframe Space (PIFS); it has higher priority than the DCF. The PC, which is typically specified as being co-located with the AP, generates beacon frames at regular intervals. thus every station knows when the next beacon frame wi l l arrive: this time is called target beacon transition time (TBTV and is announced in every beacon frame. The beacon frame is a management frame that maintains the synchronization o f the local timers in the stations and delivers protocol related parameters. With the PCF. a Contention Free Period (CFP) and a Contention Period (CP) alternate over time (Fig I). During the CFP, the PCF is used for accessing the medium. while the DCF is used during the CP. Also, the PC maintains a list o f all associated CF-pollable nodes; it wi l l poll all the STA that are on its list during the CFP. 2.2 Limitations of legacy PCF in supporting QoS The PCF has several serious limitations in supporting QoS. These limitations include the unpredictable CFP starting t i ine and unknown transmission duration o f the polled stations. A t TBTT, a PC schedules the beacon as the next frame to be transmitted, and the beacon can be ti-ansnnitted when the medium has been determined to be idle for at least PIFS. From the IEEE 802.1 I specification [I]. non-AP stations can Stan The 14"""" IEEE 2003 International Symposium on Persona1,lndoor and Mobile.Radio Communication Proceedings their traiisiiiissioiis even if the MSDU delivery callnot finish .,' h u k m the upcoming T B T T If the time the beacon frame is drlaycd. t i le transmission of time-bounded MSDUs that have to be delivered in CFP wil l also be delayed. This may severely aftect the QoS as this introduces unpredictable time delays in, eacli CFP. depending on IYaiiie lengths. fragmentation, and the o i t r e d tral'fic. The unpredictable delay introduced by this prohicni \vas considered unacceptable for high quality A V iransinissian as well as tlie Voice applications. Another liinitation with the PCF is the unknown transiiiissioii tinie of pdlecl statioiis. A polled station is allowed to send a single iratiir that may be fiagineiited and o f arbitrary length. up to the inaxiiiiuiii of 230-1 byks. Moreover, the stations may choose to switch the PHY rate based 011 [I], which means,the dui-ation of the MSDU delivery following the polling i s out of the coiitrol o f the PC. Clearly. this could cause the PC great difficulty i n delivering guaranteed QoS to other stations to he polled during the rest of the CFP. I SFP rciwiiliur) inlerrval i . t'urtherinore. the I'CF has some other liiiiitations. For exaiiiple. all the CF-poilable STA's have the same level o f priority since they are simply polled one by one. The PC has i o poll al l the STA on i t s poll i i ig list. even ifthere i s no traffic tu be w i t . Since the CFP repetition rate is iiot dynamically vuriable. tlisre is a tradc-of1 between low latency applications requiring a fast repetition rate and an efficient'use of the insdiuiii requiring slower repetition irate. Most of the time, s d i a tradeof7would be difficult. It should be noted that the PCF is an optional mode in IELE 802.1 I. It has not been widely implemented and deployed yet. and iiiost likely wi l l not be deployed in the I l l t i i re because better inecliaiiisins liave been defined in the coiiiiiig 502. I l e supplement. 3 Xew Channel Access mechanisms in 802.11e Since the beginning of the TCe. two different approaches l iave herti proposed to provide 00s. Simply speaking, one approacii eiiipliasizes QoS support based on DCF and to avoid using polling. Another approach was proposed to improve the PCF. After years o f debating and compromises.

In the current environment which consists of a multitude of wireless networks, live migration of multimedia streaming between different types of connectivity offers important advantages for mobile users. In this paper we provide the description of efficient mobility service architecture for multimedia environments. The proposed architecture handles multimedia streaming adaptation, session management, and takes into consideration user profiles and a set of quality of service criteria. Session management in a mobile environment also implies that a handover mechanism must be used in order to ensure session continuity when a user moves from one network to another. Our architecture supports handover at the application layer, which offers a better quality control than the majority of mobility solutions. In order to demonstrate the performance of our mobility solution, we analyse results from different test scenarios.	access network;cloud computing architecture;computer architecture;denial-of-service attack;experiment;information management system (ims);quality of service;scott continuity;seamless3d;server (computing);session (computer science);streaming media;user profile	Elena Simona Apostol;Valentin Cristea	2012	IJWGS	10.1504/IJWGS.2012.049170	real-time computing;computer science;operating system;session initiation protocol;mobility model;mobile computing;world wide web;computer network	Mobile	-14.353762918103406	91.32848135218448	37934

Therefore, we had proposed a service platform which integrates service control and network control by componentization of distributed objects. On the other hand, with advances of wireless communication technologies, users eager to have network services with a mobile terminal. However, this platform does not consider any wireless access networks. In this paper, we extend the platform to support mobile terminals with heterogeneous wireless access networks and also propose a traffic load balancing method on them for bandwidth guaranteed services. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by simulation experiments.	access network;component-based software engineering;distributed object;experiment;load balancing (computing);mobile phone;network switch;quality of service;simulation;wireless access point	Hiroki Matsuyama;Yuya Inoue;Yusuke Hirota;Kazuhiko Kinoshita;Hideki Tode;Takashi Watanabe	2014	The 16th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium	10.1109/APNOMS.2014.6996596	cellular traffic;real-time computing;mobile qos;heterogeneous network;radio resource management;wireless network;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	-13.718870299998715	89.04334214412376	38096
d5b3548e66734459f3304859e54e1798f57af0d1	dynamic reallocation of sla parameters in passive optical network based on clustering analysis		The introduction of new services as well as the growth in the number of communication terminals in the last years has led to an exponential growth of data traffic in both fixed and mobile networks. Passive Optical Networks (PONs) offer high bandwidth services to service providers customers. However, due to the dynamicity of users traffic patterns, PONs need to rely on an efficient upstream bandwidth allocation mechanism to define for each customer the amount of data that needs to be transmitted at a specific time. This mechanism is currently limited by the static nature of Service Level Agreement (SLA) parameters which can lead to an unoptimized bandwidth allocation in the network. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism for optimizing the allocation of upstream Gigabit-capable Passive Optical Networks (GPON) resources based on the dynamic adjustment of some SLA parameters according to customer's estimated traffic patterns. Clustering analysis is used to differentiate customers according to their bandwidth utilization based on real-time and historical data. Three user classes are taken into account: heavy, light and flexible. Our work considers two fundamental clustering algorithms, namely K-means, a very well-known partitioning method and DBSCAN, one of the most common density-based clustering algorithms. An experimental study is conducted to evaluate the two algorithms and select which one can be the most suitable for the differentiation of user classes.	algorithm;cluster analysis;dbscan;experiment;gigabit;hierarchical clustering;k-means clustering;passive optical network;quality of service;real-time clock;service-level agreement;time complexity;tracing (software);upstream (software development)	Nejm Eddine Frigui;Tayeb Lemlouma;Stéphane Gosselin;Benoit Radier;Renaud Le Meur;Jean-Marie Bonnin	2018	2018 21st Conference on Innovation in Clouds, Internet and Networks and Workshops (ICIN)	10.1109/ICIN.2018.8401589	service provider;service-level agreement;quality of service;computer network;bandwidth allocation;channel allocation schemes;dbscan;cluster analysis;computer science;passive optical network	ML	-15.122848939818967	100.13420225747262	38247
d8200efc8fc89213f6a5ef9c0d74415097d72422	empirical analysis of local round trip time for wireless traffic differentiation		This paper focuses on how to differentiate wireless traffic from wired peer by using the temporal TCP characteristics of SYN, FIN, and ACK local round trip times (LRTT) found in all TCP sessions. With these session-based temporal characteristics, traffic from wireless and wired nodes can be differentiated by exploiting the fundamental differences between Ethernet and 802.11b/g/n. The effort of this paper is then on analyzing the resulting empirical LRTT data extensively and designing several algorithms for effective wireless host discovery. Most algorithms are light-weight, with little memory overhead, and can be easily implemented on commodity hardware. Ultimately, SYN, FIN, and ACK LRTTs can be compared against each other to discover wireless hosts regardless of network speeds.		Guangzhi Qu;Michael M.

Such an approach can lead to a significant number of packet drops and thus a severe deterioration in performance of high bandwidth applications. Cross-layer protocols which do relay and forward corrupted packets have exhibited substantial promise to mitigate the above problem and thus their utility for wireless multimedia needs to be explored further. Moreover, there is a need to identify efficient channel coding methods for the cross-layer channel. Unlike the traditional schemes, where the channel observed at the application layer is a pure erasure channel, in the cross-layer schemes the application layer channel exhibits hybrid erasure-error impairments. Thus in this paper, we use a rather abstract link-layer model on the basis of which we compare the performance of cross-layer and conventional schemes. We identify the modifications required to be made to RS and LDPC based FEC schemes in order to use them over hybrid erasure-error channels. Finally we compare the considered schemes in terms of video quality using the emerging H.264 video standard. Our video analysis is based on employing a hybrid error-erasure channel coding FEC for the cross-layer schemes versus employing erasure recovery FEC for the traditional protocols. We show that cross-layer schemes can lead to a significant improvement in video quality.	algorithm;binary erasure channel;channel capacity;forward error correction;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;low-density parity-check code;network packet;relay;simulation;video content analysis	Shirish S.

Source classifier, network monitor, and system controller are designed to perform the rules for identifying the operating error control states. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme by comparing its performance with three existing schemes in terms of loss rates, throughput, and quality degradation.	atm turbo;elegant degradation;error detection and correction;forward error correction;network monitor;throughput;volume boot record	Abdulmohsen A.

The critical parameters of primary interest for the evaluation of the scheme are the packet delivery cost and its scalability. To this direction, a telecommunication cost analysis of the MBMS service is presented based on the transmission cost over the air interface, as well as the costs of all interfaces and nodes of the MBSFN architecture.

Network engineers would benefit from automated means to approximate these subjective measures, such as the ITU-T E-model, in the development and planning phases. We have improved this call quality model to allow on-the-fly measurement while dealing with uncertainty inherent to the model, included additional corrections, and implemented it as a ns-2 module. Accurate and on-the-fly evaluation also enables further analysis and optimization tasks, such as those performed in previous work. We compare our version against the original definition of the E-model and present further results from our simulations.	approximation algorithm;mathematical optimization;simulation	Alberto Salmerón;Pedro Merino	2013		10.1145/2512840.2512860	real-time computing;simulation;computer science;operations management	HCI	-9.413334165476783	100.71408921946814	39131

The coverage in terms of delivered quality per receiver is an important measure to evaluate the experienced quality. In order to provide a reasonable quality for all receivers in a network cell, we analyze graceful degradation techniques in Rel. 6 of 3rd Generation Partnership Project's (3QPP) Multimedia Broadcast and Multicast Services (MBMS). We show the benefits of using H.264/AVC temporal scalability in an existing system for graceful degradation in order to add coverage for users in poor reception conditions, although at a reduced level of quality. For that we define assessment techniques for measuring the quality coverage describing the amount of users reached with a certain media play-out quality. We connect this quality coverage to a measure for used network cell capacity giving the used network resources for 3QPP Rel. 6 network cells. We evaluate graceful degradation under simulated 3QPP Rel. 6 network conditions showing the benefits of graceful degradation for 3QPP MBMS mobile television services.	elegant degradation;fault tolerance;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;mobile television;multimedia broadcast multicast service;rel;scalability;software deployment	Cornelius Hellge;Thomas Schierl;Jörg Huschke;Thomas Rusert;Markus Kampmann;Thomas Wiegand	2008	2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing	10.1109/ICIP.2008.4712188	cellular network;telecommunications;computer science;multimedia;computer network	Visualization	-7.065779983041165	102.43402794471851	39135

The need to deliver media content to a great variety of mobile and wireless devices is delineated as the indisputable future trend. This is instigated by the fact that wireless networks can now support the quality requirements of media streaming delivery, while mobile devices are able to present a variety of media content. This paper presents the Enamorado architecture that allows decoupling the development of mobile devices from advances in content formats and implements an intelligent system that selects the most appropriate content format in terms of for example device limitations, end-user preferences and current network conditions. This is particularly important, in cases which demand maximising the number of admitted users, without compromising the user's quality standards. Finally, this paper presents a case study to present how the system's intelligence is applied in a real network.	digital distribution	Eugenia G. Nikolouzou;Petros Sampatakos;Evangelos A.

A high speed mobile on a highly directed path does not need to update its location as long as the mobile maintains its speed and direction since the network can predict the location of the mobile using the mobile's speed and direction information. On the other hand, for a mobile doing a random walk, the location prediction using the speed and direction information is inefficient in terms of the signaling cost and prediction accuracy. With this observation, we dynamically classify mobiles based on the predictability of their trajectory. A mobile with predictable trajectory is prescribed a predictive distance-based location update scheme and a mobile with random trajectory is prescribed a (non-predictive) distance-based location update scheme. The performance of the adaptive scheme is compared with the predictive and non-predictive schemes.

But in the government and military sectors, as everywhere else, there is an ever increasing push to migrate towards a single, packet-based communications infrastructure. This so-called Next Generation Network (NGN) is based on Ethernet, IP and Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) infrastructures. One of its biggest benefits is to bring together or converge equipment and applications-email, voice, data, video-on to a single network for the first time, thus greatly reducing costs and increasing manageability. But, it is not an ideal solution for all applications and traffic types. Organisations which must place security high on their list of priorities are therefore presented with a dilemma. While wanting to stay at the forefront of network technology and maintaining or improving connectivity options, security experts are nervous that a move to IP-based secure systems will expose new constraints for some critical or legacy services. Ideally, they would like to take advantage of the reach, cost-reductions and manageability of NGN, but migrate secure applications at a slower pace, when the right equipment becomes available and the current secure equipment has reached the end of its life. Now they can The solution to all these worries is Patapsco's PacketBand-ISDN, the world's first Pseudo-Wire ISDN 'system in a box'.

This is likely to be valid also for the foreseeable future,  but at the same time a multitude of data services are also emerging. This trend in mobile communication has fueled the introduction  of packet-switched mobile networks, thus introducing the IP suite into the field of mobile communications. This technological  shift can be already observed in today’s 2.5 and 3G networks. In the first phases, however, mobile devices have an IP point  of attachment which seldom changes throughout the lifetime of a communication session. Mobility management is handled below  this point of attachment by means of access-specific mechanisms. A unified mobility management mechanism at the IP layer may  enable streamlined network architectures, for example as complementary access technologies emerge in next generation mobile  networks. Mobile IPv6 represents a key candidate mechanism to fulfill this vision of unified IP-based mobile communication  networks. This paper analyses and quantifies the signaling overheads in a mobile communication network that uses Mobile IPv6  for mobility management.  	mobile ip;next-generation network	Sandro Grech;Javier Poncela-González;Pedro Serna	2004		10.1007/0-387-23150-1_7	mobile broadband;radio access network;embedded system;cellular network;intelligent network;mobile identification number;3g;network architecture;mobile web;mobile telephony;imt advanced;public land mobile network;gsm services;mobile processor;computer science;operating system;mobile technology;mobile device;distributed computing;circuit switched data;mobile station;mobile computing;mobile ip;computer network	Mobile	-14.078795803806882	89.73712341303472	40197

Mobility management to enable efficient Internet access for users on the move is thus gaining significance. IETF has standardized several protocols such as Mobile IPv6, Hierarchical Mobile IPv6, and Proxy Mobile IPv6 to provide mobility management on the IP network. With future Internet design initiatives gaining momentum, it is important that these initiatives consider mobility management as an integral part of the design. In this article, we introduce the concept of Virtual Mobility Domain and describe the main features and key strengths of Virtual Mobility Domain that are designed to provide mobility management in a newly proposed tiered Internet architecture. Instead of IP addressing, the proposed Virtual Mobility Domain uses a tiered-addressing scheme to identify a mobile node with a single address regardless of its location. The tiered addressing provides a dynamic address length which brings less signaling overhead and scalable management. We also propose a collaborative network-based mobility management mechanism to provide low-latency handoffs and less processing-overhead on the mobile node compared to the IPv6-based protocols. The proposed mobility scheme unifies inter and intra-domain mobility management by introducing common anchor cloud concept which provides a distributed management and seamless mobility experience. We present comparative qualitative and quantitative performance analysis of Virtual Mobility Domain and aforementioned IPv6-based mobility protocols for Intra-AS roaming support. We examine handoff latency and signaling overhead performance of each protocol based on numerical results retrieved from analytical models and OPNET modeler based simulations. The results from a comparative performance study show the potential for more efficient mobility management under the proposed Internet architecture.	profiling (computer programming)	Hasan Tuncer;Andres Kwasinski;Nirmala Shenoy	2013	Computer Networks	10.1016/j.comnet.2013.05.004	telecommunications;mobility model;computer security;computer network	Web+IR	-12.589054814271114	90.05991568009706	40318
e2e289365cd877a6aa996a64745c79106d865509	youtube qoe estimation based on the analysis of encrypted network traffic using machine learning		The widespread use of encryption in the delivery of Over-The-Top video streaming services poses challenges for network operators looking to monitor service performance and detect potential customer perceived Quality of Experience (QoE) degradations. While monitoring solutions deployed on client devices provide insight into application layer KPIs (e.g., video quality levels, buffer underruns, stalling duration) which can be further mapped to user QoE, network providers commonly rely primarily on passive traffic monitoring solutions deployed within their network to obtain insight into user perceived degradations and their potential causes. In this paper we present a methodology for the estimation of end users' QoE when watching YouTube videos which is based only on statistical properties of encrypted network traffic. We have developed a system called YouQ which includes tools for monitoring and analysis of application-layer KPIs and corresponding traffic traces, and the subsequent use of this data for the development of machine learning models for QoE estimation based on traffic features. To test this approach, we have collected a dataset of 1060 different YouTube video traces using 39 different bandwidth scenarios. All video traces are annotated with application-layer KPIs and classified into one of three QoE classes. The dataset was used to test various machine learning algorithms, and results showed that up to 84\% QoE classification accuracy could be achieved using only features extracted from encrypted traffic.	algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);definition;encryption;machine learning;network traffic control;streaming media;tracing (software)	Irena Orsolic;Dario Pevec;Mirko Suznjevic;Lea Skorin-Kapov	2016	2016 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2016.7849088	telecommunications;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer network	Metrics	-9.967223940721814	98.4123737298794	40325

44a614b673f9312c34fac3e2bea7929cb07f5ab7	tight lower bounds on the maximum number of hops in p2p video streaming through multiple spanning trees		In Peer-to-Peer (P2P) video streaming systems, a given video stream is divided into several sub-streams called stripes and those stripes are delivered from the source peer to the subscribing peers through different spanning trees. Such a multiple-tree-structured video streaming increases the upload capacity of the overall system since it enables subscribers to contribute their upload bandwidth even if it is smaller than the bit rate of the whole video stream. Assume that the video stream is divided into b stripes, and each peer, including the source peer can upload b stripes to the other peers at the same time. In this paper, we focus on the maximum height over b spanning trees to enable the delivery of b stripes to n subscribers, which corresponds to the maximum latency of the video streaming service. In particular, we derive a tight lower bound on the maximum height for any combination of b and n.	file spanning;peer-to-peer;spanning tree protocol;streaming media;stripes;upload	Takuya Shoji;Satoshi Fujita	2017	2017 Fifth International Symposium on Computing and Networking (CANDAR)	10.1109/CANDAR.2017.65	latency (engineering);computer network;bandwidth (signal processing);upload;computer science;upper and lower bounds;spanning tree	Metrics	-8.875557324669998	103.71970174219575	40522

This paper presents several techniques for designing the architectures of small photonic switching modules that switch in three divisions. In one technique, Marcus' (1970) classical transformation from a space-only Clos network to a time-space-time architecture is generalized to the wavelength division and extended to three divisions. In another technique, Hunter's (see IEEE J. Lightwave Technol., vol.11, no.3, p.495-511, 1993) space-time transformation is also generalized and extended to three divisions. It is illustrated on several classical network architectures, including the most elementary case of a three-division photonic switching module based on the Benes (1965) architecture: an eight-by-eight network in which each side has two fibers and each fiber has two wavelengths and two timeslots.

A test communications satellite, CS-1, was launched in 1977, and CS-3 will be launched in 1988 as a successor to CS-2. On the other hand, in the area of mobile satellite communications development, Japan is proceeding with an experimental program; ETS-V/EMSS (Engineering Test Satellite-V/Experimental Mobile Satellite System), for which a satellite will be launched in 1987. A follow-on experimental ETS-VI program is planned and will be launched in 1992 as a 2000-kg weight class satellite. Japan has also begun an Experimental Platform Study as a step toward the Geostationary Communication Platform. This paper reviews and explains the scenario, activities, and objectives of satellite communications development in Japan.

This opens a new realm of possible applications such as telephony and gaming. However, before many of these applications can become widespread, the issue of mobility must be solved. Currently, the time required for wireless clients to handoff or transition their connection between APs (Access Points) is too long, causing call dropouts. This study investigates a specific aspect of handoff known as scanning. Improvements to current scanning mechanisms are proposed and tested in a variety of experiments. In addition, our experimental approach reveals previously unknown scanning issues in 802.11 networks.	experiment;image scanner	David Murray;Terry Koziniec;Michael Dixon	2007	2007 IEEE Internatonal Conference on Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems	10.1109/MOBHOC.2007.4428661	wi-fi;cognitive radio;wireless wan;channel access method;heterogeneous network;wireless site survey;telecommunications;radio resource management;wireless network;wireless distribution system;wireless lan controller;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;capwap;municipal wireless network;wi-fi array;rogue access point;fixed wireless;computer security;wireless intrusion prevention system;hidden node problem;computer network	Mobile	-15.869478790479944	89.52412526789189	41181

Especially Bluetooth based networks require an elaborate management of restrictions the Bluetooth standard implies. In this paper we will point out the main requirements to be considered before forming such networks. We will also describe the most common Bluetooth based network topologies and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. In addition to this, we will give an overview of a selected set of Bluetooth network forming algorithms and examine these under consideration of said aspects and topology decisions.

Therefore, novel mechanisms and protocols are needed to provide seamless mobility between different wireless access technologies. This paper presents novel handover procedures, based on media independent schemes, to address seamless mobility in heterogeneous environments. We propose an enhanced Media Independent Handover Framework (eMIHF), which extends IEEE 802.21 by allowing for efficient provisioning and activation of QoS resources in the target radio access technology during the handover preparation phase, and efficiently interacts with the mobility processes of different technologies employed. We evaluate eMIHF using the ns-2 simulator, and demonstrate that the proposed handover scheme provides seamless mobility, with low latency and no packet loss.	assistive technology;compaq lte;dvb-h;digital video broadcasting;internet access;network packet;programming paradigm;provisioning;quality of service;seamless3d;wireless access point	Pedro Neves;Francisco Fontes;Susana Sargento;Márcio Melo;Kostas Pentikousis	2009	VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073535	wimax;embedded system;communications protocol;the internet;media;quality of service;mobile telephony;nist;internet access;wireless application protocol;telecommunications;computer science;packet loss;digital video broadcasting;transport layer;computer network;low latency	Visualization	-13.087737399076738	90.56105153129567	41336

A key aspect of such frameworks and of the services developed using those frameworks is that they are often independent of communication sessions. In this paper we argue that there is a class of applications that could enable novel new applications that interact with communication sessions. Most end-point frameworks do not deal with such applications because they seem to require complex call control modeling and application arbitration. In this paper, we motivate the need for applications that interact with communication sessions, propose a framework that allows rapid development of user-centric services without the need for complex call modeling or application arbitration. We present our realization of the proposed framework with examples and use cases from live trial systems.	android;software deployment	Krishna Kishore Dhara;Tim I.

To establish their position in the market, businesses are beginning to realize that understanding each of their customers' likes and dislikes is perhaps as important as the offered content itself. Further, a number of companies are also delivering content, product previews, advertisements, etc. via video on their sites. The question remains - how effective are video engagement channels on sites? Can that user engagement be quantified? Clickstream data can furnish important insight into those questions using videos as a communication or messaging medium. To that end, focusing on a large set of web portals owned and managed by a private media company, we propose methods using these sites' clickstream data that can be used to provide a deeper understanding of their visitors, as well as their interests and preferences. We further expand the use of this data to show that it can be effectively used to predict user engagement to video streams, quantifying that metric by means of a survival analysis assessment.	algorithm;blueprint;clickstream;digital distribution;digital video;feature selection;mobile phone;personalization;portals;proactive parallel suite;streaming media;video clip;web content	Everaldo Aguiar;Saurabh Nagrecha;Nitesh V.

The quality is mainly affected by network impairments such as delay, jitter and packet loss. Playout buffer at the receiving side can be used to compensate for the effects of jitter based on a tradeoff between delay and loss. The main aim in this paper is to find an efficient perceived quality prediction method for perceptual optimization of playout buffer. The contributions of the paper are three-fold. First, we propose an efficient new method for predicting voice quality for buffer design/optimization. The method can also be used for voice quality monitoring and for QoS control. In the method, nonlinear regression models are derived for a variety of codecs (e.g. G.723.1/G.729/AMR/iLBC) with the aid of ITU PESQ and the E-model. Second, we propose the use of minimum overall impairment as a criterion for buffer optimization. This criterion is more efficient than using traditional maximum mean opinion score (MOS). Third, we show that the delay characteristics of voice over IP traffic is better characterized by a Weibull distribution than a Pareto or an exponential distribution. Based on the new voice quality prediction model, the Weibull delay distribution model and the minimum impairment criterion, we propose a perceptual optimization buffer algorithm. Preliminary results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve the optimum perceived voice quality compared with other algorithms under all network conditions considered.	algorithm;codec;end-to-end principle;letter-quality printer;mathematical optimization;network packet;nonlinear system;pesq;packet delay variation;pareto efficiency;playout;quality of service;time complexity;translation lookaside buffer	Lingfen Sun;Emmanuel C.

The switching program for the ISDN should be so designed as to realize the control of various voice and nonvoice services and provide for developing service enhancement. To attain the goal, the ISDN services are classified hierarchically and each category is allocated to appropriate network nodes for implementation. As a result, the local switching program provides an out-slot subscriber line signaling capability and call connection with appropriate compatibility checking including a check for access capability to communications processing nodes. The switching program modules specific to analog services and those specific to digital services are separated to allow the use of the existing program file and to afford easy program design and maintenance. Remote-controlled switching is a suitable means for an economical introduction of the ISDN services to low traffic density areas. Special routing and reliability arrangements as well as the program structure for a remote-controlled switch are discussed.	integrated services digital network;software design	Toshio Yajima;Kouichi Suda	1986	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.1986.1146474	embedded system;real-time computing;frame relay;digital subscriber line;telecommunications;computer science;software design;isdn digital subscriber line;integrated services digital network;program design language;5ess switch;circuit switching;computer network	Mobile	-20.02637636821373	92.26567713172791	41509

It requires signaling mechanisms, policing mechanisms, accurate and rapid accounting of network resources, and call admission control. We present a novel protocol that provides bandwidthguarantees to Internet packet flows. This protocol, called the Edge-assisted Quality of Service (EQOS) protocol, requires modifications to only a subset of an administrative domain’s routers, namely the edge routers on the domain’s periphery. Legacy routers within the core of the domain require no modifications. We present the results of several simulation experiments showing that EQOS is able to provide bandwidth guarantees to competing flows.	administrative domain;algorithm;best-effort delivery;differentiated services;experiment;http public key pinning;internet;interoperability;network packet;quality of service;requirement;reserved word;resource reservation protocol;router (computing);scalability;simulation;traffic flow (computer networking)	Sudeept Bhatnagar;Brett J.

If a received frame is corrupted, then these SSR indications can be used to provide robust apriori estimate of the bit error rate in the packet. In many recently proposed cross-layer protocols, for transmission of video over wireless networks, recovery of information from partially corrupted packets has shown significant utility. In this paper, based on experiments with actual 802.11b error traces, we show that the channel state information (CSI) provided by the SSR indications can be used to improve the error recovery performance of an FEC scheme employed in conjunction with a cross-layer protocol.

Location management scheme also include replication strategy to reduce the location lookup cost of called mobile user. It plays important role in personal communication services in order to reduce call setup cost, call setup time, and increases the QoS (quality of service). In prior replication schemes, called user’s location profile is placed at some fixed and limited number of visitor location registers (VLRs) based on call history of the caller. In prior hybrid schemes location update and replication strategies are combined together. These prior hybrid schemes apply pointer forwarding strategy and replication. But these schemes have limitations like holding “loose” form of location profile and higher location update cost. We have proposed a new hybrid scheme which includes adaptive replication of updated user’s location profile and mobility anchoring point (MAP) for location update. The main objective of the proposed scheme is to reduce call setup cost and call setup time. In order to achieve the objective, adaptive replication is applied at certain visitor location registers (VLRs) according to movement of caller. The replica is kept updated at MAP and replicated to neighbor VLRs as per movement of the caller. We have presented fluid-flow based analytical modeling which shows that proposed scheme outperforms the prior hybrid scheme.	bandwidth (signal processing);flip-flop (electronics);lookup table;pointer (computer programming);quality of service;replication (computing)	Prem Nath;Chiranjeev Kumar	2013	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-013-1032-0	real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	-10.07190116604665	89.31710475700703	41618

The key idea in Diffserv is to achieve scalability through handling aggregates of traffic instead of individual flows. More specifically, at the ingress edge router, each flow is shaped and classified into one of few service classes. Based on these service classes, packets are then forwarded and discarded (if necessary) with different priorities in network core routers/switches. As many network service providers today employ ATM in their backbone networks, there is tremendous interest in supporting IP Diffserv in an ATM environment. This paper presents a study on using ATM ABR service to support IP Diffserv. The idea is to use the flow control mechanism in ABR to eliminate the need for discarding packets inside the ATM network, while service differentiation among different IP flows can simply be supported by proper packet scheduling and/or discarding mechanisms at the ingress edge routers/switches. Scalability is achieved by setting up an ABR virtual circuit (VC) between each pair of ingress and egress routers rather than on a per-flow basis. A simulation study of this Diffserv framework over ATM using the Opnet simulation tool is presented to validate our idea.	atm turbo;differentiated services	Richard Rabbat;Kai-Yeung Siu;Nail Akar	1999		10.1109/ICCCN.1999.805519	real-time computing;the internet;quality of service;differentiated service;computer science;asynchronous transfer mode;flow control;distributed computing;virtual circuit;queueing theory;scheduling;packet switching;computer network	Networks	-6.637355907381554	94.43043066618958	41671

Consideration of video service quality has become essential to provide the end users with satisfying Quality of Experience (QoE). In order to evaluate and manage the video quality, methods for QoE assessment are desired to estimate the service quality perceived by the end users. In this paper, we study a number of existing objective quality assessment models for assessing the QoE of video applications, and compare their performance with simulations to find out their individual advantages and limitations to use in practice. To overcome the shortcomings of the existing models, this paper proposes an enhanced QoE model which considers a wide range of codec rates and video formats, and moreover considers the packet losses and video content dependence in quality assessment. Simulation results show that the proposed QoE model can be applied for evaluating the quality of different video sources in the Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, considering the lossy property of mobile networks. In addition to the objective QoE methods, we also plan to carry out subjective tests in the lab as well as in the real system for the subjective evoluation of QoE.	codec;compaq lte;data rate units;digital video;graphics display resolution;lossy compression;mathematical optimization;network packet;quality of service;requirement;server message block;simulation;video file format	Xi Li;Somya Aggarwal;Amanpreet Singh;Andreas Könsgen;Carmelita Görg;Mehmet Kus	2013	6th Joint IFIP Wireless and Mobile Networking Conference (WMNC)	10.1109/WMNC.2013.6548959	subjective video quality;telecommunications;computer science;video quality;multimedia;pevq;computer network	Metrics	-9.191294988102023	100.44921008153355	41947

Although MPTCP provides significant increase in network capacity, it may suffer from poor delay performance since the delay tends to be aligned with the worst-performing path: packets delivered through a short-delay subflow have to wait in the reordering buffer for packets being transmitted over a long-delay subflow. In this paper, we investigate the application-level delay performance of streaming traffic over MPTCP, and develop an analytical framework to take into account non-negligible network queuing delay and the interplay of congestion control between multiple subflows. We design a simple threshold-based subflow traffic allocation scheme that aims to minimize user-level delay and develop a receiver-centric traffic splitting control (R-TSC) that can be tuned to user preferences. The client-side R-TSC solution facilitates incremental deployment of low-delay streaming service over MPTCP.

Callers dislike touch-tone IVRs and seek agent assistance at the first opportunity. However, because of high agent costs, call center managers continue to seek automation with IVRs. The challenge for call centers is providing user-friendly, yet cost-efficient, customer service. This article describes a comprehensive methodology for usability re-engineering of telephone voice user interfaces based on detailed call center assessment and call flow redesign. At the core of our methodology is a data-driven IVR assessment, in which we analyze end-to-end recordings of thousands of calls to evaluate IVR cost effectiveness and usability. Because agent time is the major cost driver in call center operations, we quantify cost-effectiveness in terms of agent time saved by automation in the IVR. We identify usability problems by carefully inspecting user-path diagrams, a visual representation of the sequence of events of thousands of calls as they flow through the IVR. Such an IVR assessment leads directly into call-flow redesign. Assessment insights lead to specific suggestions on how to improve a call-flow design. In addition, the assessment enables us to estimate the cost savings of a new design, thus providing the necessary business justification. We illustrate our IVR usability and re-engineering methodology with examples from large commercial call centers, demonstrating how the staged process maximizes the payback for the call center while minimizing risk.	cost efficiency;diagram;dual-tone multi-frequency signaling;end-to-end encryption;interactive voice response;optimizing compiler;path analysis (statistics);usability;voice user interface	Bernhard Suhm;Pat Peterson	2002	I.

Forward error correction (FEC) codes for low-delay interactive applications have several characteristics that distinguish them from traditional FEC. The encoding and decoding operations must process a stream of data packets in a sequential fashion. Strict latency constraints limit the use of long block lengths, interleaving, or large buffers. Furthermore, these codes must achieve fast recovery from burst losses and yet be robust to other types of loss patterns.	code;data buffer;error detection and correction;forward error correction;internet of things;loss function;network packet;virtual reality	Ahmed Badr;Ashish Khisti;Wai-tian Tan;John Apolstolopoulos	2017	IEEE Signal Processing Magazine	10.1109/MSP.2016.2639062	games;real-time computing;simulation;computer science;multimedia;forward error correction;internet of things	OS	-7.246274821049559	101.33078634966756	42618

We present MORC, a novel rate-control protocol for mobile networks. MORC builds on the PCC protocol design framework to strike a balance between low latency and high throughput. Lab trials and early field tests show that MORC outperforms traditional TCP congestion control and the recent BBR protocol, achieving faster file download times, higher resiliency to network changes, better bandwidth utilization, and improved quality of experience for video clients.

This presents an exciting opportunity to service providers, especially when employing broadcast channels such as cable television and satellites. Unlike previous NVOD schemes, which were all highly structured, we employ an algorithmic approach to produce Tailor-Made transmission schemes that dominate all previous ones in both resource consumption and flexibility. The ability to tailor the transmissions to match resource availability is often key to the practicality of the service in a given environment.

However, we found that many of these applications have an increasing need to monitor not only the few largest flows (say top 20), but also all of the medium-sized flows (say top 20,000). Unfortunately, existing techniques for identifying elephant flows at high link speeds are not suitable and cannot be trivially extended for identifying the medium-sized flows. In this work, we propose a hybrid SRAM/DRAM algorithm for monitoring all elephant and medium-sized flows with strong accuracy guarantees. We employ a synopsis data structure (sketch) in SRAM to filter out small flows and preferentially sample medium and large flows to a flow table in DRAM. Our key contribution is to show how to maximize the use of SRAM and DRAM available to us by using a SRAM/DRAM hybrid data structure that can achieve more than an order of magnitude higher SRAM efficiency than previous methods. We design a quantization scheme that allows our algorithm to “read just enough” from the sketch at SRAM speed, without sacrificing much estimation accuracy. We provide analytical guarantees on the accuracy of the estimation and validate these by means of trace-driven evaluation using realworld packet traces.	algorithm;anomaly detection;data structure;dynamic random-access memory;elephant flow;mind;network packet;network traffic control;static random-access memory;tracing (software);video synopsis;vii	Ashwin Lall;Mitsunori Ogihara;Jun Xu	2009	IEEE INFOCOM 2009	10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062217	embedded system;algorithm design;parallel computing;real-time computing;data structure;quantization;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;accuracy and precision;particle detector;computer network	Metrics	-5.994120921841972	89.99771673092096	43123

1c556100651e245ab25a47f073c3033c14acb113	analysis of the relationship between server location and rtt		Round Trip Time (RTT) has a decisive impact on Quality of Experience (QoE) and is therefore used as a key indicator in performance analysis. The location of the remote server is known as the most important indicator of the RTT, which is the basis of the server installation such as CDN and Proxy. However, in modern networks, private networks such as Wi-Fi and home routers are installed at the edge of the network, making it difficult for an ISP to measure its own RTT. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between server location and RTT to cover a private network like a home router. The correlation coefficient between the RTT and the server location over 100 ms is 0.33, which indicates that the distance to the server is the main factor that influences QoE when communicating with specific servers. We have gathered participants for the experiment to collect the data and have analyzed the characteristics of the group. Our research contributes to the field of analyzing the actual performance of the client with the consideration of the private network.	coefficient;content delivery network;private network;profiling (computer programming);proxy server;residential gateway;router (computing);server (computing)	Hyunsu Mun;Jeasung Na;Hanul Park;Seungtae Kim;Youngseok Lee;John Springer	2018	2018 IEEE 42nd Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)	10.1109/COMPSAC.2018.00162	real-time computing;round-trip delay time;private network;correlation coefficient;quality of experience;computer science;router;server	Metrics	-13.02419013530812	97.995156661456	43278

21b118a82c7ed58c894aeff91412738c9e62afd9	an analysis of the technical and economic essentials for providing video over fiber-to-the-premises networks		This paper presents a cost comparison of two video transport methodologies on a passive optical network (PON): an out-of-band radio frequency (RF) video overlay and in-band video delivered as multicast Internet Protocol (IP) packets. The RF overlay approach has traditionally been favored for video transmission on a PON due to the availability of cable television (CATV)-like components, including CATV-ready televisions, but recently the lower network costs associated with converging voice, data, and video on an all-packet network (so called “Internet Protocol television” [IPTV]) have begun to be recognized. We have quantified the full cost of the RF video overlay, taking into account all the physical parameters that affect the cost of such deployments, allowing an accurate evaluation of the economics of this system under a variety of configurations. Our IP video model estimates the cost of a multicast IP video network, using analysis of viewer data to estimate the actual bandwidth requirements in real-world IPTV deployments. Using these models we compare the cost of RF video overlay and IP video technology for fiber to the premises (FTTP). We show that the choice of the lowest-cost video solution is sensitive to take-rate and channel lineup in particular, but that IPTV is the lowest-cost solution under the majority of likely deployment circumstances.

The proposed architecture includes adaptive components that model the network as a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP). Specifically, an ingress node adoptively performs connection admission and flow classification, while each core router performs joint bandwidth allocation and buffer management for the network classes. The main objective is to maximize average long term network revenue, and at the same time, effectively minimize average long term QoS violations. We use a model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) technique to find the optimal policy for each DiffServ component.

A variety of empirical cost-sharing policies are used in practice by backbone network operators but very little ever reaches the research literature about their properties. Motivated by this, we present a systematic study of such policies focusing on the discrepancies between their cost allocations. We aim at quantifying how the selection of a particular policy biases an operator's understanding of cost generation. We identify F-discrepancies due to the specific function used to map traffic into cost (e.g., volume vs. peak rate vs. 95-percentile) and M-discrepancies, which have to do with where traffic is metered (per device vs. ingress metering). We also identify L-discrepancies relating to the liability of individual customers for triggered upgrades and consequent costs (full vs. proportional), and finally, TCO-discrepancies emanating from the fact that the cost of carrying a bit is not uniform across the network (old vs. new equipment, high vs. low energy or real estate costs, etc.). Using extensive traffic, routing, and cost data from a tier-1 network we show that F-discrepancies are large when looking at individual links but cancel out when considering network-wide cost-sharing. Metering at ingress points is convenient but leads to large M-discrepancies, while TCO-discrepancies are huge. Finally, L-discrepancies are intriguing and esoteric but understanding them is central to determining the cost a customer inflicts on the network.	internet backbone;routing;scientific literature;software metering;tier 1 network;total cost of ownership	László Gyarmati;Rade Stanojevic;Michael Sirivianos;Nikolaos Laoutaris	2012		10.1145/2398776.2398830	relevant cost;telecommunications;implicit cost;computer science;backbone network;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Metrics	-16.54539017204625	99.69754637515345	44037

Since user mobility is already widely observed in the current Internet and seen as one of the main features of the future Internet, seamless mobility needs to be kept in mind for whatever routing mechanisms developed for IdCN. However, seamless handoff techniques from the IP world won't work because no Care-of-Address or the alike is available in IdCN to help quickly locating the mobile user's new position, therefore it is difficult to redirect the packets in transit before the routing protocol re-finds the moved users. In this paper a dynamic ring mechanism that does not rely on but can work with any IdCN routing protocol is proposed to support seamless handoff in IdCN. During a handoff, the mobile user makes use of this ring to keep its global connectivity, and leaves after the handoff finishes. Appropriate timing of hooking to and leaving the ring is crucial to keep the overhead at minimum. Experiments show that the proposed mechanism can indeed prevent most packet drops and keep the flow running during handoffs at reasonably lower cost than simple retransmission.	algorithm;care-of address;future internet;hooking;internet backbone;keyboard shortcut;network packet;overhead (computing);redirection (computing);retransmission (data networks);routing;seamless3d	Dagang Li;Wenpeng Sha	2015	2015 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communication (ISCC)	10.1109/ISCC.2015.7405633	wireless routing protocol;routing;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;quantum tunnelling;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;mobility model;triangular routing;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-11.07220199237209	89.58372444406658	44101

IP is an excellent means to exchange data, which explains its success. It remains ill suited as a means to provide many other types of service; and is too crude to form the transport infrastructure in its own right. To allow the continued success of IP, we must be open-minded to it living alongside, and co-operating with other techniques (such as circuit switching) and protocols that are optimized to different needs. In this position paper, we question some of the folklore surrounding IP and packet switching. We conclude that while packet-switched IP will continue to dominate best-effort data services at the edge of the network, the core of the network will use optical circuit switching as a platform for multiple services.	best-effort delivery;circuit switching;network packet;packet switching	Pablo Molinero-Fernández;Nick McKeown;Hui Zhang	2003	Computer Communication Review	10.1145/774763.774781	loose source routing;real-time computing;lan switching;telecommunications;computer science;label switching;optical ip switching;computer security;circuit switching;telecommunications network;computer network	Networks	-9.153172807986532	93.35266161807999	44337

That is due to the simplicity and robustness against failures of its medium access control protocol. In addition, IEEE introduces the standard 802.11e for quality of service support. However, this standard is not considered efficient when used for some applications that don’t involve data and background in the transmission, but only voice and video. Some of these applications are video conferencing and internal organizations’ voice over internet protocols calls. For the purpose of enhancing voice over internet protocols and video streaming over IEEE802.11e WLAN, we have developed an ns-2 patch in C++ which suites our requirements in a simulation based performance enhancement. In this paper, the performance of IEEE802.11e WLAN is evaluated and discussed based on simulation study using the network simulator (ns-2.29) under Linux operating systems fedora core 4. Our simulation results showed enhanced performance for the voice and video traffics over the original IEEE802.11e standard. This shows the effectiveness and efficiency of our simulator of enhancing the performance for voice and video based applications such as video conferencing and voice over internet protocols.	access control;c++;internet protocol suite;linux;linux;network packet;operating system;quality of service;requirement;simulation;streaming media;throughput	Bahi Hour;Shihab Hameed	2009	Int.

We have designed and implemented a programmable infrastructure called VNode on a Japanese testbed network. The VNode infrastructure allows the network developer or researcher to create a slice. A slice is a set of connected virtualized computational resources and link resources. The user can easily configure and modify own network topology and deploy service functions as software like SDN and NFV. We realize multicast streaming and adaptive bit rate streaming by deploying video processing functions in a slice. Moreover, we realize automatic function deployment that responds to traffic intensity. We conduct some experiments to confirm the feasibility and usability of our use cases and the VNode infrastructure. We establish data streaming via a slice with enhanced functionalities and measure the resource utilization rate. Furthermore, we conduct some experiments on a federated slice established between VNode and GENI, which is a programmable infrastructure in the U.S. The results show that we can enhance service functionalities and use resources more efficiently by deploying software functions on programmable infrastructures.	bit slicing;computational resource;experiment;multicast;network function virtualization;network packet;network topology;operating-system-level virtualization;peer-to-peer;real-time clock;software deployment;software-defined networking;streaming media;testbed;tree network;usability;video processing	Yuki Minami;Kazuhisa Yamada	2015	2015 24th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)	10.1109/ICCCN.2015.7288437	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	-8.917685943102738	99.65866452180477	44872

It is important for cable operators to know how many resources to commit to the network to satisfy customer demands. In this paper, we develop models of voice and video traffic to determine the effect of demand growth on hybrid fiber-coax networks. We obtain a set of guidelines that network operators can use to build out their networks in response to increased demand. We begin with one type of traffic and generalize to an arbitrary number of high-bandwidth constant bit rate (CBR) like services to obtain service blocking probabilities. We consider the effect of supporting variable bit rate (VBR) packet-switched traffic in addition to CBR services. These computations help us to determine how cable networks would function under various conditions (i.e., low, medium, and heavy loads). We also consider how the growth rate of the popularity of such services would change over time, and how this impacts network planning. Our findings will help cable operators estimate how much bandwidth they need to provision for a given traffic growth model and connection blocking requirement.	enterprise resource planning;hybrid fibre-coaxial	David W.

Assessing the real-time performance of the application flows is an essential requirement for network operations and service management, as well as for identifying how the different traffic types and transports interact and behave, when they are carried over the end-to-end Internet infrastructure. This paper introduces a novel measurement technique for assessing the performance of IPv6 network flows. By exploiting IPv6 extension headers, measurement triggers and the instantaneous measurement indications are carried in the same packets as the payload data itself. providing a high level of probability that the behaviour of the real user traffic flows is being observed. The measurement mechanism is applied at the network layer and provides for a generic technique able to measure any type of traffic without depending on particular transports or on specific measurement architectures. A prototype implementation of this technique is also described and evaluated by measuring performance properties of application flows over different-capacity IPv6 environments. End-to-end delay and jitter of video streams have been measured, as well as the goodput for services operating on top of reliable transport. This measurement technique can be the basis for low-overhead, scalable, transparent and reliable measurement of individual and aggregate network flows, and can be dynamically deployed where and when required in a multi-service IP environment.	aggregate data;content-control software;end-to-end principle;goodput;high-level programming language;internet protocol suite;network traffic control;overhead (computing);payload (computing);prototype;real-time clock;sampling (signal processing);scalability;software documentation;streaming media	Dimitrios P.

This tool-set integrates EvalVid and NS-2. With the integration, researchers can easily analyze their designed mechanisms, such as network protocols or QoS control schemes in a realistic simulation environment. We used a case study about video transmission over wireless network to demonstrate the simulation with the tool-set. From the results, we found that the quality of video transmission with burst packet errors is superior to the random distributed packet errors in the same packet error rate. In addition, in the same packet error rate, unicast transmission leads to better video delivered quality than multicast transmission because of retransmission. Also, using the tool-set researchers can assess video quality not only with the evaluation metrics, but also with real video sequences. In brief, researchers who utilize our proposed QoS assessment framework will be benefited in verifying their designs regarding video transmission over wireless network	bit error rate;communications protocol;multicast;network packet;quality of service;retransmission (data networks);simulation;unicast;verification and validation;video	Chih-Heng Ke;Cheng-Han Lin;Ce-Kuen Shieh;Wen-Shyang Hwang	2006	IEEE International Conference on Sensor Networks, Ubiquitous, and Trustworthy Computing (SUTC'06)	10.1109/SUTC.2006.12	computer simulation;communications protocol;real-time computing;simulation;computer science;wireless network;computer network	Mobile	-8.183411582541638	101.123087147288	45745

However, it is very costly in terms of both hardware and software to replace a traditional LAN such as Ethernet and token ring by an ATM network. Therefore, internetworking LANs with an ATM backbone network is considered a cost-effective and most promising solution for bringing ATM into the mainstream. To sustain delay-sensitive applications (e.g., video or voice) and losssensitive applications (e.g., data transfer), this paper presents a slotted-ring network (SRN) with spatial reuse. A simple priority-based access protocol, called the check request before send (CRBS), for providing nonpreemptive multipriority services over SRN is described. SRN provides communication among an ATM switch, ATM stations, and internetworking units connected to legacy LANs. Any node of SRN in the CRBS protocol determines whether it can use a slot, without requiring any authorization or an exchange of message with the other nodes. The CRBS protocol reduces the unfairness features associated with any slotted-ring network. An analytical model is presented to analyze the CRBS protocol under Poisson input traffic and uniform output traffic. Extensive simulations are run to assess the performance of the CRBS protocol for two classes of cells with priorities 0 and 1. The analytical performance results are shown to be close to those obtained by simulations	atm turbo;authorization;desktop computer;internet backbone;internetworking;recurrent neural network;ring network;simulation;token ring	Hasan Çam	1997		10.1109/LCN.1997.630902	ring network;application software;real-time computing;cost-effectiveness analysis;video;token ring;performance;telecommunications;network switch;computer science;asynchronous transfer mode;authorization;ethernet;computer network	Networks	-7.457724779364269	90.59969885182906	45862

A large number of architectures, technologies, and mechanisms enabling IP Quality of Service have been devised toward enhancing the conventional best-effort IP service model (e.g., IETF RFC 1633, IETF RFC 2475, [1, 2]). Some of these mechanisms are already deployed in broadband IP networks. For instance, policing, scheduling, and queue management are occasionally applied toward improving network performance. Also, several IP network operators rely on marking the ToS (Type of Service) byte of IP packets toward supporting more than one class of service. Moreover, Multi-protocol Label Switching (MPLS) (IETF RFC3031) and its associated traffic engineering technologies have considerable penetration in service provider infrastructures [3]. Nevertheless, large portions of IP networks still do not employ any QoS mechanisms. The majority of service providers over-provision their backbones toward providing quality networking services to their customers [4]. Over-provisioning the IP backbones is still a very low-cost option, given that recent advances in optical transmission technology have increased the per-fiber available bandwidth. Moreover, congestion problems in large ISPs are usually affecting a small part of the network and can be simply alleviated by adding more bandwidth to that small part, rather than deploying network wide traffic control mechanisms. Over-provisioning presents inherent disadvantages, basically because it does not automatically ensure the necessary QoS, due to the best-effort handling of data. Delay jitter cannot be controlled since IP traffic is characterized by frequent generation of short-lived flows and burstiness at various timescales. These factors frequently lead to poor application performance. Therefore, QoS research targeting IP networks still remains in the foreground. The interest in IP QoS is expected to gradually increase due to the proliferation of mission-critical IP applications (e.g., Voice-over-IP, Internet telephony, tele-conferencing, virtual private networks, e-commerce), ABSTRACT After more than a decade of active research on Quality of Service in IP networks and the Internet, the majority of IP traffic relies on the conventional best-effort IP service model. Nevertheless, some QoS mechanisms are deployed in current networking infrastructures, while emerging applications pose QoS challenges. This survey brings into the foreground a broad range of research results on Quality of Service in IP-based networks. First, a justification of the need for QoS is provided, along with challenges stemming from the convergence of IP and wireless networks and the proliferation …	atari tos;best-effort delivery;byte;class of service;control system;delay line memory;e-commerce;internet protocol suite;internet research;item unique identification;mission critical;multiprotocol label switching;network congestion;network performance;packet delay variation;provisioning;quality of service;scheduling (computing);stemming;television;type of service;virtual private network	John Soldatos;Evangelos Vayias;George Kormentzas	2005	IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials	10.1109/COMST.2005.1423335	real-time computing;mobile qos;computer science;operating system;wireless network;distributed computing;computer network	Networks	-8.267159742283667	93.9410761326561	45951

Current thin-client systems are ideally suited to be used with classic office-applications but as soon as multimedia and 3D gaming applications are used they require a large amount of bandwidth and processing power. Furthermore, most of these applications heavily rely on the Graphical Processing Unit (GPU). Due to the architectural design of thin-client systems, they cannot profit from the GPU resulting in slow performance and bad image quality. In this paper, we propose a thin-client system which addresses these problems: we introduce a realtime desktopstreamer using a videocodec to stream the graphical output of applications after GPU-processing to a thin-client device, capable of decoding a videostream. We compare this approach to a number of popular classic thin-client systems in terms of bandwidth, delay and image quality. The outcome is an architecture for a hybrid protocol, which can dynamically switch between a classic thin-client protocol and realtime desktopstreaming.	desktop computer;desktop sharing;graphical user interface;graphics processing unit;image quality;low-power broadcasting;overhead (computing);personal digital assistant;thin client;usability	Davy De Winter;Pieter Simoens;Lien Deboosere;Filip De Turck;Joris Moreau;Bart Dhoedt;Piet Demeester	2006		10.1145/1378191.1378210	image quality;bandwidth management;real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;multimedia;computer security;profitability index;computer network;adaptation	OS	-8.203147088004632	99.8999754137559	46025

This requires that the network is able to offer quality of service (QoS) appropriate for the latency and throughput bounds needed to meet the real time constraint. An important component for QoS provisioning is resource estimation and quality prediction. The paper describes a model-based resource prediction (MBRP) mechanism to support real time communication in multi-hop wireless networks. Specifically, we develop an analytical model for differentiated MAC scheduling protocols. The model can predict per-flow and system-wide throughput and delivery latency, thereby enabling admission control of the flows and providing an efficient network management utility. After describing the basic model, we propose enhanced MBRP (EMBRP) for realistic network environments. Our proposed quality prediction method is beneficial in the deployment of a real ad hoc network where knowledge of resource allocation and consumption is needed to meet the service requirements. Analytical and simulation results show that EMBRP provides accurate flow quality prediction. The results also demonstrate the effectiveness of EMBRP as an admission control solution in multi-hop ad hoc networks.	hoc (programming language);provisioning;quality of service;requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation;software deployment;throughput	Yuan Sun;Xia Gao;Elizabeth M.

In this paper, we present the Autonomic Service Architecture (ASA), a uniform framework for automated management of both Internet services and their underlying network resources. ASA ensures the delivery of services according to specific service level agreements (SLAs) between customers and service providers. As an illustrative example, ASA is applied to the management of DiffServ/MPLS networks, where we propose an autonomic bandwidth sharing scheme. With the proposed scheme, the bandwidth allocated for each SLA can be automatically adjusted according to the measured traffic load and under policy control for efficient resource utilization, while SLA compliance over the network is always guaranteed. 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed differentiated services (DiffServ) framework, which supports aggregate traffic classes, is seen as the key technology to achieve this. DiffServ currently concentrates on control/data plane mechanisms to support QoS but also recognises the need for management plane aspects through the bandwidth broker (BB). In this paper we propose a model and architectural framework for supporting end-to-end QoS in the Internet through a combination of both management and control/data plane aspects. Within the network we consider control mechanisms for traffic engineering (TE) based both on explicitly routed paths and on pure node-by-node layer 3 routing. Management aspects include customer interfacing for service level specification (SLS) negotiation, network dimensioning, traffic forecasting and dynamic resource and routing management. All these are policy-driven in order to allow for the specification of high-level management directives. Many of the functional blocks of our architectural model are also features of BBs, the main difference being that a BB is seen as driven purely by customer requests whereas, in our approach, TE functions are continually aiming at optimising the network configuration and its performance. As such, we substantiate the notion of the BB and propose an integrated management and control architecture that will allow providers to offer both qualitative and quantitative QoS-based services while optimising the use of underlying network resources.	differentiated services;quality of service	Panos Trimintzios;Ilias Andrikopoulos;George Pavlou;Carlos Frederico Cavalcanti;Danny Goderis;Yves T'Joens;Panos Georgatsos;Leonidas Georgiadis;David Griffin;Richard Egan;Christian Jacquenet;George Memenios	2001		10.1109/INM.2001.918008	real-time computing;mobile qos;the internet;quality of service;differentiated service;computer science;computer security;network layer;computer network	Networks	-13.214999261271329	93.40675755417449	46489

An analytical framework is introduced for characterizing the traffic dependency between AP and MH by taking into account the issues impacting the seamless stream handoff (e.g., AP out-of-synch, handoff latency and path-setup delay). Based on it, a proactive hot-zone flow control scheme is proposed, which employs a simple threshold-based policy for regulating the traffic flow between AP and MH prior to handoff. The simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme can significantly reduce the playback hiccups while consuming limited buffer space, compared with the one without any special attention. Particularly, deployment of a few-second-video-length buffer in AP and MH is capable of achieving the seamless stream handoff most of the time subject to fairly loose constraints of the AP synch error (ranging /spl plusmn/3 sec) and handoff latency (around 1 second).	flow control (data);modified huffman coding;multicast;proactive parallel suite;seamless3d;self-replicating machine;serial experiments lain;server (computing);simulation;software deployment;unicast;visual intercept;wireless access point	Sheau-Ru Tong;Sheng-Hsiung Yang	2005	2005 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo	10.1109/ICME.2005.1521372	multicast;the internet;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;traffic flow;flow control;distributed computing;broadcasting;computer network	Mobile	-6.385706066355741	96.98518907753737	46660
3a8e2eb20f987e518458386dcd44fd8d11df936d	narrowing the gap between qos metrics and web qoe using above-the-fold metrics		Page load time (PLT) is still the most common application Quality of Service (QoS) metric to estimate the Quality of Experience (QoE) of Web users . Yet, recent literature abounds with proposals for alternative metrics (e.g., Above The Fold, SpeedIndex and their variants) that aim at better estimating user QoE. The main purpose of this work is thus to thoroughly investigate a mapping between established and recently proposed objective metrics and user QoE. We obtain ground truth QoE via user experiments where we collect and analyze 3,400 Web accesses annotated with QoS metrics and explicit user ratings in a scale of 1 to 5, which we make available to the community. In particular, we contrast domain expert models (such as ITU-T and IQX) fed with a single QoS metric, to models trained using our ground-truth dataset over multiple QoS metrics as features. Results of our experiments show that, albeit very simple, expert models have a comparable accuracy to machine learning approaches. Furthermore, the model accuracy improves considerably when building per-page QoE models, which may raise scalability concerns as we discuss.	approximation algorithm;effective method;experiment;exponential time hypothesis;ground truth;loader (computing);machine learning;quality of service;racket;scalability;subject-matter expert;time complexity;web application	Diego N. da Hora;Alemnew Sheferaw Asrese;Vassilis Christophides;Renata Teixeira;Dario Rossi	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-76481-8_3	data mining;subject-matter expert;computer science;real-time computing;quality of service;scalability;quality of experience;ground truth	Web+IR	-9.84213093399243	99.58235126815855	46703

Different bandwidth estimation techniques are implemented for different transport protocols, such as using the TFRC rate when available or calculating the packet transmission rate otherwise. It is observed that controlling the rate of packets dispatched to the transport queue to match the video extraction rate resulted in oscillatory behavior in DCCP CCID3, decreasing the received video quality. Experimental results show that video should be sent at the maximum available network rate rather than at the extraction rate, provided that receiver buffer does not overflow. When the network is over-provisioned, the packet dispatch rate may also be limited with the maximum extractable video rate, to decrease the retransmission traffic without affecting the received video quality.	network packet;retransmission (data networks);scalable video coding	Burak Gorkemli;A.

The use of Raptor code AL-FEC is taken into account for the adaptation of the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) used in the physical layer. A cross-layer optimization approach is used to select the Raptor code parameters and the MCS mode jointly, in order to maximize transmission efficiency. The proposed methodology takes into consideration the channel resources required to accommodate the Raptor overheads. Simulation results show that packet loss is eliminated and the amount of radio resource required is reduced significantly. Automatic repeat request (ARQ) based unicast systems require up to 115.6 percent more channel resources, by comparison to the proposed Raptor-aware LA system without retransmissions. Furthermore, the Raptor-aware LA system can enhance the link budget by up to 4 dB, increasing coverage in LoS locations, and can improve total goodput by 46.7 percent compared to an ARQ-based system.	algorithm;automatic repeat request;block code;code rate;display resolution;forward error correction;goodput;mathematical optimization;modulation;network packet;overhead (computing);raptor code;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectral efficiency;streaming media;throughput;unicast	Victoria Sgardoni;Andrew R.

Such networks are characterized by long and variable propagation delays, intermittent connectivity, limited bandwidth and low bit rates. Due to the wireless mode of communication between the sensor nodes, a medium access control (MAC) protocol is required to coordinate access to the shared channel and enable efficient data communication. However, conventional terrestrial wireless network protocols that are based on RF technologies cannot be used underwater. In this paper, we propose PLAN - a MAC Protocol for Long-latency Access Networks that is designed for use in half-duplex underwater acoustic sensor networks. We utilize CDMA as the underlying multiple access technique, due to its resilience to multi-path and Doppler's effects prevalent in underwater environments, coupled with an RTS-CTS handshaking procedure prior to the actual data transmission. Using simulations, we study the performance and efficiency of the proposed MAC protocol in underwater acoustic networks.	access control;acoustic cryptanalysis;carpal tunnel syndrome;centralized computing;channel (communications);communications protocol;doppler effect;duplex (telecommunications);handshaking;mike lesser;multipath propagation;radio frequency;scalability;sensor;simulation;software propagation;terrestrial television;throughput	Hwee Xian Tan;Winston Khoon Guan Seah	2007	32nd IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN 2007)	10.1109/LCN.2007.98	next-generation network;telecommunications;computer science;knowledge management;resource management;computer security;computer network;satisfiability;access network	Mobile	-8.319771603769556	89.91928621875566	46834

One of the more recent proposals is the Differentiated Services (Diff-Serv) architecture, and in this paper we explore how the policing actions and associated rate guarantees provided by the Expedited Forwarding (EF) translate into perceived benefits for applications that are the presumed users of such enhancements. Specifically, we focus on video streaming applications that arguably have relatively strong service quality requirements, and which should, therefore, stand to benefit from the availability of some form of enhanced service. Our goal is to gain a better understanding of the relation that exists between application level quality measures and the selection of the network level parameters that govern the delivery of the guarantees that an EF based service would provide. Our investigation, which is experimental in nature, relies on a number of standard streaming video servers and clients that have been modified and instrumented to allow quantification of the perceived quality of the received video stream. Quality assessments are performed using a Video Quality Measurement tool based on the ANSI objective quality standard. Measurements were made over both a local Diff-Serv testbed and across the QBone, a QoS enabled segment of the Internet2 infrastructure. The paper reports and analyzes the results of those measurements.	differentiated services;entity framework;internet;quality of service;requirement;streaming media;testbed	Wael Ashmawi;Roch Guérin;Stephen Wolf;Margaret H.

Although these topics remain relevant, our position is that the primary design focus for systems beyond 1 Tb/s must be shifted to aspects resulting from packaging disruptions. Based on trends such as increased link rates and improved CMOS technologies, we derive new design factors for such switch fabrics. For instance, we argue that the packet round-trip transmission time within the fabric has become a major design parameter. Furthermore, we observe that high-speed fabrics have become extremely dependent on serial I/O technology that is both high speed and high density. Finally, we conclude that in developing the architecture, packaging constraints must be put first and not as an afterthought, which also applies to solving the tremendous power consumption challenges.	algorithm;cmos;denial-of-service attack;input/output;network packet;network switch;packet switching;requirement;scheduling (computing);terabyte;throughput	Cyriel Minkenberg;Ronald P.

The benefits of the proposed algorithm over other algorithms are fast execution, due to its simplicity, and small message authentication code size. The algorithm is capable of detecting even a small number of bit errors in relatively small packets that are used in video streaming. These features have never previously been available at the same time. Another benefit of the approximate authentication is that it supports error resilient video decoding by dropping packets with too many bit errors, thus improving the perceived quality of the video stream.

In this paper, we examine a wireless service provider network that needs to upgrade as trunks are reaching exhaust. A choice of upgrade solutions is available based on using a time division multiplexing (TDM) tandem switch or a packet tandem switch. Selecting the preferred solution raises some business continuity questions: Are there any identifiable strategies that improve the business proposition? Which is the preferred upgrade solution? How does each choice compare to the present mode of operations (PMO)? How does each choice compare to reliability and security requirements? We answer these and other reliability questions by examining the different call paths and traffic profiles. We include the effects of traffic growth and product reliability improvements (roadmaps) on the network reliability plus network security issues with emphasis on the modeling of vulnerabilities of the data path.	24-hour clock;backup;benchmark (computing);best, worst and average case;business continuity;circuit switching;downtime;internet backbone;markov chain;markov model;multiplexing;network packet;network security;network switch;packet switching;plan;reliability engineering;requirement;scott continuity;softswitch;tandem computers;vulnerability (computing)	Chun K.

Such solution is based on the control of the medium access right, by means of a virtual token passing procedure among enhanced stations, complemented by an underlying prioritization mechanism. Such underlying mechanism guarantees that, whenever an enhanced (real-time) station is contending for the bus access, it will be able to access the bus prior to any other station. Thus, it enables the traffic separation between standard and enhanced (real-time) stations, being able to guarantee real-time communication in unconstrained traffic environments	algorithm;coexist (image);exponential backoff;real-time clock;real-time transcription;sensor;static timing analysis	Francisco Borges Carreiro;Ricardo Moraes;José Alberto Fonseca;Francisco Vasques	2005	2005 IEEE Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation	10.1109/ETFA.2005.1612556	local area network;embedded system;communications protocol;real-time computing;ethernet flow control;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;operating system;computer network	Embedded	-20.235029795447993	89.41728741256674	47291

Due to mobile phone limitations, but also due to the scarce bandwidth on mobile networks, video content is often adapted to fit with these requirements by reducing its quality. In this study we look into how the user preference for a certain multimedia content (e.g. video, audio, text and images or only text) and the usage of mobile data affects user preference for video quality. The results show a statistically significant difference in the video quality preference only for participants who reported that video is one of the preferred multimedia content types, and the ones who did not. We also discuss how these results could be used for multimedia streaming and in telecommunications marketing research to improve user experience and increase network operators and content provider revenues.	digital video;mobile phone;requirement;user experience	Andreea Molnar	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)	10.1109/ICME.2016.7552872	mobile search;the internet;mobile telephony;computer science;video quality;machine learning;multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web;consumer behaviour	Mobile	-10.784486331527253	99.93876402954274	47624

With speedy consumption of videos being a norm these days, authenticating video files (video + audio) becomes a challenging task. Conventional authentication schemes only focus on individual track such as audio or video. Therefore, in this work, we propose an authentication system where authentication values from video and audio are weaved by exploiting data embedding techniques in the compression/media layer and system layer. Specifically, the authentication value from video is embedded into audio, and vice versa. The authentication values for both audio and video are generated by using the key embedded in the system layer and cryptographic hash function. As a proof of concept, the ideas are implemented on MP4 format container and evaluated using various short movie clips downloaded from YouTube. Results suggest that imperceptible quality degradation and insignificant file size increment were achieved.	authentication;byte;cryptographic hash function;cryptography;elegant degradation;embedded system;mobile device;multiplexing;smartphone;tablet computer;video clip;video file format	Imdad MaungMaung;Yiqi Tew;KokSheik Wong	2016	2016 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA)	10.1109/APSIPA.2016.7820780	computer science;multimedia;video processing;smacker video;internet privacy;world wide web	HCI	-13.165634165703322	101.87109941480226	47672

We would like to prioritize network game traffic over these bandwidth restricted links. However, the limited resources of consumer access devices make this problematic. We propose a solution whereby the classification of flows is outsourced to an ISP-based system. The access device is then notified of flow classifications and can apply a simple flow prioritization rule. We have developed a prototype of this system and found it viable in terms of functionality, timeliness of classification, and scalability.	access network;bottleneck (software);consumer network;network packet;outsourcing;prototype;quality of service;real-time transcription;scalability	Jason But;Grenville J.

Recently, tele-communication equipment and service providers seek to connect the wireless mobile telecommunication networks to the Internet directly. These enhanced wireless mobile networks can result in a reorganized set of conventional functions for better developed services.In order to enable these functions, the enhanced All-IP based SS7 communication network is required. The standards associations such as 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and 3GPP2 of mobile communication offer the Internet Protocol (IP) Multimedia Sub-system (IMS) as well as the Multi-Media Domain (MMD) systems. The numerous requirements and issues have been emerged in the changeover process of the wireless Signaling System No. 7 (SS7) for All-IP network. The crucial point is to ensure interoperability among heterogeneous networks. In this paper, a function named Multi-Protocol Mobility Manager (MPMM) is developed. It can satisfy the requirements and issues required in All-IP networks. The proposed MPMM enables roaming functions between 3GPP and 3GPP2 protocols, can reduce the load of the network, and provides other valuable services. The performance of the system is tested and evaluated. From the results of the performance tests, we believe that MPMM can help improve the networks functionalities.	internet protocol suite;interoperability;mikumikudance;requirement;semantic network;signalling system no. 7;telecommunications network;television	Hyung-Soo Park;Hyung Woo Lee;Seong-Jin Park;Dong Hoon Lee	2009	2009 International Conference on Complex, Intelligent and Software Intensive Systems	10.1109/CISIS.2009.41	telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Robotics	-15.939276648907944	91.77222366474587	47699

For example, in traffic monitoring, every incoming event, such as a packet's entering a router or a car's entering an intersection, should ideally have an immediate outgoing counterpart. We propose a new class of constraints -- Conservation Rules -- that express the semantics and characterize the data quality of such applications. We give confidence metrics that quantify how strongly a conservation rule holds and present approximation algorithms (with error guarantees) for the problem of discovering a concise summary of subsets of the data that satisfy a given conservation rule. Using real data, we demonstrate the utility of conservation rules and we show order-of-magnitude performance improvements of our discovery algorithms over naive approaches.	approximation algorithm;data quality;inbound marketing;long division;method of analytic tableaux;network packet;router (computing);website monitoring	Lukasz Golab;Howard J.

The project SAT4NET, funded under the ARTES 1 program of the European Space Agency (ESA), has the goal of analyzing the technical and economic feasibility of an integrated xDSL/satellite network architecture. The key idea is to exploit the very broad coverage of satellite to provide additional bandwidth to users in a digital divide situation, only when they need it, so as to keep the commercial offer to the users competitive with respect to similar offers by pure terrestrial telecom operators in densely populated areas. In this paper the architecture of such a hybrid network is outlined, along with discussing the key design choices that were identified in the study. Furthermore, results from the performance evaluation study of the network, based on packet-level simulations, are reported to show the effectiveness of the main proposed solutions.	digital subscriber line;downstream (software development);esa;network architecture;network packet;performance evaluation;population;simulation;software deployment;terrestrial television	Claudio Cicconetti;Agostino Isca;George Agapiou;Ioanna Papafili;Erasmo Atteo;Maurizio Manzo;Dimitris Syvridis;Michael Bourmpos	2014	2014 7th Advanced Satellite Multimedia Systems Conference and the 13th Signal Processing for Space Communications Workshop (ASMS/SPSC)	10.1109/ASMS-SPSC.2014.6934557	electronic engineering;simulation;telecommunications;engineering	Metrics	-19.421689092202495	95.42449779831993	47708
cda6853106636938d48b7c098e9773c7c0f543f4	performance analysis of heterogeneous tcp congestion control environments		There are a number of congestion control algorithms currently deployed and in use on the Internet today. These have a direct influence on streaming quality when delivering video content. The congestion algorithm determines how a stream behaves, such as how it reacts to congestion in the network, as well as influencing the maximum throughput that the stream is able to achieve. These are important metrics when discussing streaming video, as the streaming behaviour has a direct impact on the end user experience. An analysis on the state of TCP congestion control is presented, with the aim of highlighting conflicts that can occur in a heterogeneous congestion control environment. This includes some initial observations on the experimental congestion control algorithm, BBR, which is currently being developed by Google.	algorithm;behavior-based robotics;continuation;cubic function;data buffer;digital distribution;digital video;fairness measure;internet;maximum throughput scheduling;network congestion;private network;profiling (computer programming);rectifier (neural networks);streaming media;tcp congestion control;user experience	Paul Farrow	2017	2017 International Conference on Performance Evaluation and Modeling in Wired and Wireless Networks (PEMWN)	10.23919/PEMWN.2017.8308020	throughput;end user;network congestion;tcp congestion-avoidance algorithm;computer network;the internet;computer science	Networks	-8.341955989344564	97.50801450241393	47840

Such identification can be used in enterprise firewalls for blocking unauthorized viewing of tunneled video. We attempt to characterize and evaluate the impacts of the primary TA-influencing factors, namely, streaming protocol, codec, and the actual video content. A test environment is built to study the influence of those factors while Packet Size Distribution is used as the classification feature during Traffic Analysis. Analysis done on data obtained from the test environment has shown that the streaming protocols provide the most dominant source identification distinction. Also, while the codecs provide some weak distinctions, the influence of video content is marginal. In addition to in-laboratory experiments, a real-world verification for corroborating those observations is also made with commercial streaming service providers. Such long-haul experiments indicate that the end-to-end network conditions between the streaming server and video client can act as an additional influencing factor for traffic analysis towards video stream source identification. Overall, the results suggest the feasibility of TA for unknown video stream source identification with sufficiently diverse video examples.	authorization;blocking (computing);codec;deployment environment;digital video;end-to-end encryption;experiment;firewall (computing);marginal model;network packet;network performance;server (computing);streaming media;traffic analysis	Yan Shi;Subir Biswas	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommuncations Systems (ANTS)	10.1109/ANTS.2015.7413623	real time streaming protocol;real-time computing;computer science;video tracking;world wide web;computer network	Metrics	-9.78057213555549	98.13572541192076	47919
20ea64389217e9f4e96d097fa98613ef5fc17870	on rate limitation mechanisms for tcp throughput: a longitudinal analysis	journal article	TCP remains the dominant transport protocol for Internet traffic. It is usually considered to have its sending rate covered by a sliding window congestion control mechanism. However, in addition to this normal congestion control, a number of other mechanisms limit TCP throughput. This paper analyzes the extent to which network, host and application settings define flow throughput over time and across autonomous systems. Our study draws on data from a longitudinal study spanning five years of passive traces collected from a single transit link. Mechanisms for this include limiting by application, interference with the TCP window control mechanism and artificial limitations on maximum window sizes by the operating system. This paper uses a large data set to assess the impact of each mechanism. We conclude that more than half of all heavy-hitter inbound traffic remains throttled by constraints beyond network capacity. For this data set, TCP congestion control is no longer the dominant mechanism that moderates throughput.	autonomous system (internet);file spanning;inbound marketing;interference (communication);internet;network congestion;operating system;tcp congestion control;throughput;tracing (software);window function	João Taveira Araújo;Raul Landa;Richard G.

We find low overall mobility in the network, power-law characteristics in user mobility profiles, and weak correlations between call activity and mobility levels for individual users.

Some researchers proposed segmentation-based caching algorithms to improve the disk utility in the homogeneous environment. Other researchers proposed caching algorithms with video layering or transcoding to improve the perceptual quality in the heterogeneous environment. However, for a low cost proxy, these systems are suffering from either inflexible structures or high computation. In this paper, the overall quality hit ratio(QHR) is proposed to measure how well the clients' requests on the quality are satisfied. Aiming to achieve the highest QHR, an intelligent caching algorithm is designed to determine the appropriate perceptual quality of the segments cached in the proxy. This innovative approach takes not only the access bandwidth distribution into account, but also the segment popularity distribution. Simulation results demonstrate that our variable rate caching(VRC) algorithm not only achieves the highest QHR but also keeps its complexity at an acceptable level.	algorithm;cache (computing);computation;disk utility;hotspot (wi-fi);internet backbone;proxy server;simulation;subject matter expert turing test;vii	Xu Du;Tai Wang;Zongkai Yang;Jiang Yu;Wei Liu	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2006.254885	algorithm design;real-time computing;simulation;transcoding;explosive material;jitter;spine;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system;computational model;hot spot;bandwidth;statistics;computer network;satisfiability	Robotics	-6.458255411691401	96.97350055174427	48319

A congested router transmitting multimedia packets, while inflicting a packet loss rate beyond a given threshold, effectively transmits useless packets. Useless packet transmission wastes router bandwidth when it is needed most. We propose an algorithm to avoid transmission of useless multimedia packets, and allocate the recovered bandwidth to competing TCP flows. We show that the proposed algorithm can be easily implemented in well-known WFQ and CSFQ fair packet queueing and discarding algorithms. Simulation of a 15-second MPEG-2 video clip over a congested network shows that the proposed algorithm effectively eliminates useless packet transmission, and as a result of that significantly improve throughput and file download times of concurrent TCP connections. For the simulated network, file download time is reduced by 55% for typical HTML files, 36% for typical image files, and up to 30% for typical video files. A peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) based analysis shows that the overall intelligibility of the received video is no worse than that received without the incorporation of the proposed useless packet transmission avoidance algorithm. Our fairness analysis confirms that implementation of our algorithm into the fair algorithms (WFQ and CSFQ) does not have any adverse effect on the fairness performance of the algorithms.	algorithm;best-effort delivery;byte;discounted maximum loss;download;downstream (software development);end-to-end principle;fairness measure;h.262/mpeg-2 part 2;html;intelligibility (philosophy);mpeg-2;network packet;network topology;peak signal-to-noise ratio;router (computing);scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput;transmitter;type of service;video clip;video file format;weighted fair queueing	Jim Wu;Mahbub Hassan	2003	Computer Communications	10.1016/S0140-3664(02)00276-1	real-time computing;the internet;peak signal-to-noise ratio;telecommunications;adverse effect;computer science;transmission control protocol;mpeg-2;tcp vegas;transmission delay;packet switch;computer network	Networks	-5.504375992818842	97.79587763491584	48474

Typically, wireless network performance measurements are made at multiple layers of the wireless protocol stack, i.e. link layer, MAC layer and network layer. This study highlights the impact of layer 2 frame aggregation that is enabled by default in the software drivers for commodity wireless 802.11 devices while it is still not a part of the core 802.11 standard. Using experimental measurements, it is shown that this feature has an impact across a diverse set of wireless experiments and should be considered while comparing results. Measurements on the ORBIT testbed show that throughput measurements can vary up to a startling 25% for certain packet sizes and the variance in receiver side interframe delays can almost double if MAC aggregation and preset transmission opportunities are not taken into consideration. Further results for VoIP traffic show a deterioration in jitter of up to 8 times when coupled with MAC layer aggregation in 802.11.	emulator;experiment;hotspot (wi-fi);network packet;network performance;protocol stack;sensor;testbed;theory;throughput;transport layer security	Gautam D.

868de52f6e0647f462e86a5a7ea4eb95dab82b10	evaluating predictors of congestion collapse in communication networks		Congestion in communication networks can be modeled as a percolation process, where congestion spreads minimally before a critical load and expands rapidly afterwards. Some studies identify predict onset of rapidly expanding congestion in time to alert network managers to take mitigating actions to avoid congestion collapse. The paper specifies five predictors: autocorrelation, variance, threshold, growth persistence, and growth rate. Predictor performance is measured for three simulated network models, under two traffic scenarios: increasing and steady load. Predictors are compared on implementation cost, accuracy, warning time, and persistence. The rates and types of prediction errors are also characterized. Results showed that: (1) predictor performance is influenced by network-model realism; (2) the autocorrelation and variance predictors performed poorly in some situations; (3) the threshold predictor yielded best overall accuracy, with mean warning time exceeding seven minutes for the most realistic network model. The paper also suggests a necessary condition to control false positives.	autocorrelation;branch predictor;emulator;experiment;kerrison predictor;local variable;network congestion;network model;network topology;onset (audio);overhead (computing);percolation;persistence (computer science);router (computing);simulation;telecommunications network	Christopher Dabrowski;Kevin Mills	2018	NOMS 2018 - 2018 IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium	10.1109/NOMS.2018.8406225	time series;reliability engineering;telecommunications network;network model;autocorrelation;network congestion;distributed computing;computer science;false positive paradox	Arch	-13.91307356458703	98.88739738352257	48677

Multi-path transport protocols provide increased throughput or reliability, by utilizing these interfaces simultaneously. However, multi-path transmission over networks with very different QoS characteristics is a challenge. In this paper, we studied Multi-Path TCP (MPTCP) in heterogeneous networks, specifically MBB networks and WLAN. We first investigate the effect of bufferbloat in MBB on MPTCP performance. Then, we propose a bufferbloat mitigation algorithm: Multi-Path Transport Bufferbloat Mitigation (MPT-BM). Using our algorithm, we conduct experiments in real operational networks. The experimental results show that MPT-BM outperforms the current MPTCP implementation by increasing the application goodput quality and decreasing MPTCP's buffer delay, jitter and buffer space requirements.	algorithm;bufferbloat;burst mode clock and data recovery;experiment;goodput;linux;marginal model;minimum bounding box;modern portfolio theory;multipath propagation;network congestion;packet delay variation;quality of service;requirement;scanline rendering;scheduling (computing);smartphone;system requirements;throughput	Simone Ferlin Oliveira;Thomas Dreibholz;Özgü Alay	2014	2014 IEEE 22nd International Symposium of Quality of Service (IWQoS)	10.1109/IWQoS.2014.6914310	embedded system;heterogeneous network;telecommunications;computer science;wi-fi array;computer network	Mobile	-4.761403481296995	91.67795913574408	49202

The second is for residential users and initially offers POTS (plain old telephone service) and narrowband ISDN and analog TV services.

However, providing this kind of services over infrastructure-less networks like ad hoc networks presents many additional problems. One of these problems is how to share resources fairly among the users involved. In this article we propose a QoS framework supporting scalable video streaming in mobile ad hoc networks based on distributed admission control and video traffic awareness. Our framework promotes fairness between video flows in terms of resource consumption. It also guarantees a significant reduction of the idle times experienced by users during periods of network saturation, thus increasing the video playout time in reception for all users. Using the IEEE 802.11e MAC technology as our basis for traffic differentiation, our framework, called DACME-SV (Distributed Admission Control for MANET's - Scalable Video), relies on a periodic probing process to measure the available bandwidth and the end-to-end delay on the path. DACME-SV adopts a cross-layer approach to determine the optimum number of video layers to transmit at any given time, thus avoiding network congestion and guaranteeing an acceptable video quality at the destination. Experimental results show that idle time periods are substantially decreased, while exhibiting a good overall performance in terms of throughput and delay.	algorithm;codec;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;experiment;fairness measure;hoc (programming language);mobile device;network congestion;playout;quality of service;scalability;streaming media;systemverilog;throughput	Pedro Alonso Chaparro;Jesus Alcober i Segura;Jânio M.

Galileo SAR is an addition to the well established humanitarian satellite-based SAR System Cospas-Sarsat (CS) and will be fully compliant. In succession we developed a concept for a Short Message Service which is adaptable to the existing system by exploiting the improved channel characteristics of the Galileo system. Primary, the integrated feedback channel of Galileo enables a two way communication. This paper presents a description of the service flow, message design and channel properties of Galileo SAR-SMS.

The protocol optimizes the performance on video delivery with concern to friendliness with interfering traffic. DVRC enables a closed-loop control between server and client, where the receiver detects the state of congestion, determines the proper transmission rate, and eventually opts for the optimal number of layers that should be delivered according to this rate. The protocol relies on a hybrid Additive Increase Additive Decrease (AIAD)/Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD) algorithm (namely AIAMD) that manages to differentiate congestive and non-congestive loss by utilizing history in its control rules. AIAMD combines the most desirable features of AIAD and AIMD, reacting gently to random loss and more aggressively to congestion and adapting effectively to the dynamics of the network. Therefore, DVRC enables the desired smoothness for video streaming applications and at the same time avoids significant damage during congestion. Exploring DVRC’s potential through extensive simulations, we identify notable gains in terms of bandwidth utilization and smooth video delivery. Furthermore, our results indicate that the protocol allocates a well-balanced amount of network resources maintaining friendliness with corporate	additive model;algorithm;control system;control theory;end-to-end encryption;fairness measure;internet;multiplexing;network congestion;network packet;onset (audio);server (computing);simulation;streaming media	Panagiotis Papadimitriou;Vassilis Tsaoussidis;Lefteris Mamatas	2008	Journal of Systems and Software	10.1016/j.jss.2008.02.067	real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Networks	-6.391947018207009	98.0620960727467	49648

Extensive work has focused on two approaches to measuring bandwidth: measuring it hop-by-hop, and measuring it end-to-end along a path. Unfortunately, best-practice techniques for the former are inefficient and techniques for the latter are only able to observe bottlenecks visible at end-to-end scope. In this paper, we develop end-to-end probing methods which can measure bottleneck capacity bandwidth along arbitrary, targeted subpaths of a path in the network, including subpaths shared by a set of flows. We evaluate our technique through ns simulations, then provide a comparative Internet performance evaluation against hop-by-hop and end-to-end techniques. We also describe a number of applications which we foresee as standing to benefit from solutions to this problem, ranging from network troubleshooting and capacity provisioning to optimizing the layout of application-level overlay networks, to optimized replica placement.	communications protocol;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;hop-by-hop transport;internet;network packet;overlay network;performance evaluation;provisioning;simulation	Khaled Harfoush;Azer Bestavros;John W.

We describe a new message-passingarchitecture, MPICH-GQ, that uses quality of service (QoS) mechanisms to manage contention and hence improve performance of message passing interface (MPI) applications. MPICH-GQ combines new QoS specification, traffic shaping, QoS reservation, and QoS implementation techniques to deliver QoS capabilities to the high-bandwidth bursty flows, complex structures, and reliable protocols used in high-performance applications-characteristics very different from the low-bandwidth, constant bit-rate media flows and unreliable protocols for which QoS mechanisms were designed. Results obtained on a differentiated services testbed demonstrate our ability to maintain application performance in the face of heavy network contention.	central processing unit;differentiated services;input/output;mpich;message passing interface;noise shaping;programmer;quality of service;testbed;traffic shaping	Alain J.

Despite extensive research regarding the user willingness to pay under different billing plans and prices it is still unclear how users choose a preferred video quality under existing mobile data plans. This is especially important as the usage of adaptive video delivery servers that make use of different video quality levels is increasing. This study presents the results of assessing user preferences for video quality under three different mobile data billing plans. The results show that the user choice of different quality of video content depends on the billing plans used. It also shows that in the case when the mobile data plan is capped but the user has the possibility to pay extra for the exceeding quantity, s/he will choose higher video quality compared to the same plan in which the bandwidth is throttled when the bandwidth is exceeded. No correlation was found between the user choices and age or gender.	electronic billing	Andreea Molnar	2016	Telematics and Informatics	10.1016/j.tele.2015.07.009	mobile broadband;computer science;video quality;marketing;internet privacy;world wide web;consumer behaviour	DB	-10.911384769271933	100.06899710452224	50374
d02113d1b958c3021410e04210fad1eb770eebe7	the good, the bad, and the kpis: how to combine performance metrics to better capture underperforming sectors in mobile networks	poles and towers;measurement;bridges;monitoring;mobile communication;mobile computing	"""Mobile network operators collect a humongous amount of network measurements. Among those, sector Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are used to monitor the radio access, i.e., the """"last mile"""" of mobile networks. Thresholding mechanisms and synthetic combinations of KPIs are used to assess the network health, and rank sectors to identify the underperforming ones. It follows that the available monitoring methodologies heavily rely on the fine grained tuning of thresholds and weights, currently established through domain knowledge of both vendors and operators. In this paper, we study how to bridge sector KPIs to reflect Quality of Experience (QoE) groundtruth measurements, namely throughput, latency and video streaming stall events. We leverage one month of data collected in the operational network of mobile network operator serving more than 10 million subscribers. We extensively investigate up to which extent adopted methodologies efficiently capture QoE. Moreover, we challenge the current state of the art by presenting data-driven approaches based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) metaheuristics and random forest regression algorithms, to better assess sector performance. Results show that the proposed methodologies outperforms state of the art solution improving the correlation with respect to the baseline by a factor of 3, and improving visibility on underperforming sectors. Our work opens new areas for research in monitoring solutions for enriching the quality and accuracy of the network performance indicators collected at the network edge."""	algorithm;baseline (configuration management);last mile;metaheuristic;network performance;particle swarm optimization;random forest;streaming media;synthetic intelligence;thresholding (image processing);throughput	Ilias Leontiadis;Joan Serrà;Alessandro Finamore;Giorgos Dimopoulos;Konstantina Papagiannaki	2017	2017 IEEE 33rd International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)	10.1109/ICDE.2017.89	simulation;mobile telephony;computer science;operating system;data mining;database;mobile computing;measurement	DB	-10.619884745411705	98.57505283613122	50764

We focus on retransmission-based techniques, which require a feedback channel but also enable to perform adaptive error control. Traditional studies of these methodologies usually consider a uniform stream of data packets. Instead, video transmission poses the non-trivial challenge that the packets have different sizes, and, even more importantly, are incrementally encoded; thus, a carefully tailored model is required. We therefore proceed on two different sides. First, we consider a low-level description of the system, where two main inputs are combined, namely, a video packet generation process and a wireless channel model, both described by Markov Chains with a tunable number of states. Secondly, from a highlevel perspective, we represent the whole system evolution with another Markov Chain describing the error control process, which can feed the packet generation process back with retransmissions. The framework is able to evaluate hybrid automatic repeat request with selective retransmission, but can also be adapted to study pure automatic repeat request or forward error correction schemes. In this way, we are able to comparatively evaluate different solutions for video transmission, as well as to quantitatively assess their performance trends in a variety of scenarios. Thus, our framework can be used as an effective tool to understand the behavior of error control techniques applied to video transmission over wireless, and eventually identify design guidelines for such systems.	channel (communications);error detection and correction;forward error correction;high- and low-level;hybrid automatic repeat request;markov chain;markov model;network packet;retransmission (data networks);selective repeat arq	Leonardo Badia;Nicola Baldo;Marco Levorato;Michele Zorzi	2010	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2010.100419	markov chain;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;markov model;statistics;computer network	Embedded	-4.721449137505002	103.65203979034524	50890

These networks will be strongly service driven, and this approach differs significantly from the traditional speech dominated in the second generation (2G) approach. Compared to 2G, in 3G, the mobile cells interact and interfere with each other more, they have hundreds of adjustable parameters, and they monitor and record data related to several hundreds of different variables in each cell. This paper shows that a neural network algorithm called the self-organizing map, together with a conventional clustering method like the k-means, can effectively be used to simplify and focus network analysis. It is shown that these algorithms help in visualizing and grouping similarly behaving cells. Thus, it is easier for a human expert to discern different states of the network. This makes it possible to perform faster and more efficient troubleshooting and optimization of the parameters of the cells. The presented methods are applicable for different radio access network technologies.	algorithm;artificial neural network;best-effort delivery;cluster analysis;content format;high-level programming language;k-means clustering;mathematical optimization;network performance;no man's sky;organizing (structure);profiling (computer programming);provisioning;radio access network;self-organization;self-organizing map;snapshot (computer storage);social network analysis;telecommunications network	Jaana Laiho;Kimmo Raivio;Pasi Lehtimäki;K.

The multimedia bridge provides for a single contact point per user, who receives only one combined video stream, which minimizes access bandwidth. This architecture solves the N-squared transmission problem of multipoint video conferencing and makes customer terminal equipment simpler and cheaper than high-end desktop workstations. The PPS provides each user with flexible presentation control of a feature-rich video bridge.

However, the authentication frameworks for various radio technologies are quite different from one another. In order to support radio reconfiguration, we proposed a radio-independent mutual authentication protocol (EAP-CRP) and a re-authentication protocol (EAP-CRP re-authentication) for CRs. This paper describes the evaluation of the EAP-CRP re-authentication for high-speed handover. The handover process has to be accomplished during the period that the mobile node stays in an overlapped area covered by ranges of the both access points. We resolved the probability of the success of the re-authentication process by making a handover simulation model, then, we estimated the model on a network simulator. As a conclusion, this paper shows that the EAP-CRP re-authentication contributes to the successful of the handover rather than any other AAA server-based authentication method even if the mobile node moves with high-speed.	aaa (video game industry);cognitive radio;extensible authentication protocol;mutual authentication;radius;server (computing);simulation;software framework;wireless access point	Ritsu Nomura;Masahiro Kuroda;Tadanori Mizuno	2007	2007 2nd International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications	10.1109/CROWNCOM.2007.4549860	telecommunications;computer science;computer security;soft handover;computer network	Mobile	-12.324628959635726	90.12248896353037	51193

Although the three architectures provide a substantially different networking model, they all assume inter-AS service level agreements (SLAs), where edge routers perform traffic metering or policing according to the SLA traffic parameters over an aggregate stream (An aggregate is a group of connections, for example all the connections of a small company, and the agreement controls an aggregate) and labels each packet as it arrives according to its conformance. The core routers, using e.g., active queue management mechanisms, identify the packet and react, accordingly. The different packet marking differentiates between service aggregate. All the above standards suggest multiple SLA parameters, using an average committed rate and an average peak rate, each with its own allowed amount of burstiness.	atm turbo;access network;active queue management;aggregate data;conformance testing;differentiated services;ip traceback;item unique identification;metro ethernet;network packet;reference model;router (computing);service-level agreement;token bucket	Miriam Allalouf;Yuval Shavitt	2006		10.1145/1368436.1368482	statistical classification;real-time computing;reference model;traffic classification;computer science;operating system;network model;computer security;active queue management;computer network;access network	Networks	-5.652384627467405	94.39543922807154	51527

B-ISDN is the transport infrastructure that has reduced technology constraints in furnishing high-bandwidth transport capabilities. At the same time, users demand for advanced multimedia service to be accessed anywhere and anytime, growing the need of a flexible and low-cost solution to provide mobility on multimedia. In this scenario IN is the forceful mechanism that not only allows a rapid and effective introduction of multimedia services, but also offers the opportunity to add mobility functions to the B-ISDN core network. An architecture of an advanced ATM node, named Mobile Broadband Service Switching Point (MB-SSP), is here investigated. Particular emphasis is given to the three major functional entities allocated within the MB-SSP: the Mobility Handling Function (MHF), the Broadband Call Control Function (B-CCF) and the Broadband Service Switching Function (B-SSF).

Content adaptive rate control, is used as a solution to this problem. Instead of transmitting all of the video content at low quality, the most important content can be transmitted at high quality while still preserving an acceptable quality for the remaining segments. Furthermore, the rate control strategy inside the individual temporal segments plays a key role for the network performance and viewing quality. Although constant quality video encoding inside the temporal segments is preferable for the best viewing experience, it causes more network packet losses due to adverse bitrate fluctuations in the video stream. In cases when the network is too much loaded, it may be better to employ constant bitrate encoding for network friendliness. In this paper, a performance analysis of constant bitrate and constant peak signal-to-noise ratio encoding for content adaptive rate controlled video streaming over wireless networks is presented. Experimental results obtained using AVC/H.264 encoding in a CDMA/HDR multi-user environment with cross-layer optimized scheduling show performance comparisons of CBR and CPSNR encoding.	algorithm;case-based reasoning;channel capacity;constant-voltage speaker system;control theory;data compression;digital video;display resolution;fast fourier transform;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;multi-user;network packet;network performance;peak signal-to-noise ratio;profiling (computer programming);scheduling (computing);streaming media;transmitter;user interface	Tanir Ozcelebi;Fabio De Vito;A.

Its burstiness and self-similarity make it hard to control and guarantee QoS, so analysis of its queuing behavior attracts much interest and attention. A new scene based M/G/1 queuing model is put forward to analyze the queuing behavior of video streams in the network buffer. Integrated with the scene length distribution, the variance of scene size and the average bit rate of GOPs, the proposed model can accurately describe the queuing behavior of video traffic overall.	queueing theory;volume boot record	Yongli Li;Guizhong Liu;Hongliang Li	2002		10.1109/LCN.2002.1181770	real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;fair queuing;network performance;queueing theory;computer network	Metrics	-5.48684078762294	99.39616128981667	53123

Thus, broadband network technologies with ability to be adaptable to user's context and application content must be considered. In this paper, we propose an on-the-fly resource reservation protocol for medical multimedia content delivery in cognitive radio networks. Our approach is based on an appropriate channels switching, that meets the need of end-to-end video quality and throughput requirements for better clinicians analysis. When a channel switching must be performed, an appropriate channel is reserved. This process will also rely on a signalling protocol which allows transmitting traffic characteristics and required network resources to all relay nodes for a best decision-making.	best-effort delivery;cognitive radio;digital distribution;end-to-end principle;multiprotocol label switching;performance;propagation constant;quality of service;relay;requirement;resource reservation protocol;signaling protocol;simulation;throughput;transmitter	Dramane Ouattara;Mohamed Aymen Chalouf;Omessaad Hamdi;Francine Krief	2014	2014 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium	10.1109/WTS.2014.6835003	telecommunications;computer science;multimedia;computer network	Mobile	-10.625323462053599	95.61263747934642	53268

Facing the trend that broad band and networking quality are emphasized, the IETF SIGTRAN working group and IEEE 802.11standards working groups proposed a new-generation communication protocol, stream control transmission protocol (SCTP) and wireless LAN communication standard, IEEE 802.11ac/VHT for transport layer and data-link layer. We wish the bandwidth of WLAN can reach Gbps level transmission performance to fulfill user's requirement towards service quality of wireless communication. Although SCTP and IEEE 802.11ac are emerging communication protocols designed to increase wireless communication quality, there have not been related researches conducting performance analysis on the two communication protocols. The results confirm that SCTP provides a better transmission performance than the traditional transmission control protocol (TCP). Furthermore, applying SCTP over IEEE 802.11ac results in a faster and more stable network environment. Consequently, SCTP and IEEE 802.11ac play key roles in realizing the vision of broadband transmissions in the digital convergence era.	communications protocol;cuecat;data rate units;performance evaluation	Rung-Shiang Cheng	2015	2015 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference Workshops (WCNCW)	10.1109/WCNCW.2015.7122536	ieee 802.2;ieee 802.11s;logical link control;communications protocol;throughput;neurfon;ieee 802.11;ieee 802.11g-2003;real-time computing;quadrature amplitude modulation;ieee 802.11w-2009;ieee 802.1x;ieee 802;telecommunications;inter-access point protocol;ieee 802.11b-1999;computer science;ieee 802.11u;ieee 802.11h-2003;ieee 802.11r-2008;ieee 802.11a-1999;bandwidth;computer network;ieee 802.11e-2005;ieee 802.1q	Visualization	-13.673270077746745	92.62741433459216	53329

These bandwidth-hungry applications now comprise a significant part of all Internet traffic and present major challenges for network service providers. The situation is more acute in mobile networks where the available bandwidth is often limited. Work towards the standardisation of High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC), the next generation video coding scheme, is currently on track for completion in 2013. HEVC offers the prospect of a 50% improvement in compression over the current H.264 Advanced Video Coding standard (H.264/AVC) for the same quality. However, there has been very little published research on HEVC streaming or the challenges of delivering HEVC streams in resource-constrained network environments. In this paper we consider the problem of adapting an HEVC encoded video stream to meet the bandwidth limitation in a mobile networks environment. Video sequences were encoded using the Test Model under Consideration (TMuC HM6) for HEVC. Network abstraction layers (NAL) units were packetized, on a one NAL unit per RTP packet basis, and transmitted over a realistic hybrid wired/wireless testbed configured with dynamically changing network path conditions and multiple independent network paths from the streamer to the client. Two different schemes for the prioritisation of RTP packets, based on the NAL units they contain, have been implemented and empirically compared using a range of video sequences, encoder configurations, bandwidths and network topologies. In the first prioritisation method the importance of an RTP packet was determined by the type of picture and the temporal switching point information carried in the NAL unit header. Packets containing parameter set NAL units and video coding layer (VCL) NAL units of the instantaneous decoder refresh (IDR) and the clean random access (CRA) pictures were given the highest priority followed by NAL units containing pictures used as reference pictures from which others can be predicted. The second method assigned a priority to each NAL unit based on the rate-distortion cost of the VCL coding units contained in the NAL unit. The sum of the rate-distortion costs of each coding unit contained in a NAL unit was used as the priority weighting. The preliminary results of extensive experiments have shown that all three schemes offered an improvement in PSNR, when comparing original and decoded received streams, over uncontrolled packet loss. Using the first method consistently delivered a significant average improvement of 0.97dB over the uncontrolled scenario while the second method provided a measurable, but less consistent, improvement across the range of testing conditions and encoder configurations.	credit bureau;data compression;distortion;encoder;experiment;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;high efficiency video coding;independence day: resurgence;internet protocol suite;network abstraction layer;network packet;network topology;next-generation network;peak signal-to-noise ratio;random access;refresh rate;streaming media;tape drive;testbed;uncontrolled format string;video coding format;visual component library (vcl)	James Nightingale;Qi Wang;Christos Grecos	2013		10.1117/12.2002451	embedded system;real-time computing;the internet;video;distortion;telecommunications;computer science;coding tree unit;multiview video coding	Metrics	-9.159006427323561	100.68749409273563	53925

Towards this end, the IEEE Task Group aa (TGaa) is currently working on the definition of the IEEE802.11aa amendment. The standardization efforts in this area aim to develop efficient QoS mechanisms by keeping in mind that any new mechanism should: 1) properly interoperate with the already existing unicast mechanisms; and 2) provide the robustness required by AV applications. In order to meet the former, the efforts are focusing on amending the existing multicast standard while to meet the latter there is a need of better understanding the stringent requirements of AV streaming applications. In this work, after reviewing the amendments introduced by the IEEE 802.11aa, we carried out an evaluation of the proposed multicast mechanisms when supporting video streaming applications. The main contribution of this work focuses therefore on evaluating the QoS parameters that the TGaa has taken into account to define the proposed mechanisms.	interoperability;multicast;quality of service;requirement;software deployment;sound card;streaming media;unicast	Maria Angeles Santos;Jose Miguel Villalón Millán;Luis Orozco-Barbosa	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2012.6364893	ieee 802.11s;real-time computing;multicast;quality of service;ieee 802.1x;reliable multicast;telecommunications;computer science;ieee 802.11u;ieee 802.11h-2003;computer network;ieee 802.11e-2005	Visualization	-13.892993949600323	93.07250386627072	53998

Nevertheless, 3G systems are subject to the low data rates (2Mbps highest for WCDMA). WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) provides hot spot coverage with high data rates (reaches 54Mbps while 802.11 a/g), but is subject to short range (reaches 100m the furthest) and lacking a roaming and mobility support. From the users’ point of view, the Integration of WLAN and 3G systems will provide a convenient and attractive way for the user to access network. The users are able to access 3G mobile network while at high speed travel or access WLAN while moving slowly or entering a specific area. However, while integrating WLAN and 3G, there are still some problems that should be considered in terms of authentication and security (such as billing, service continuity and authentication delay). In this article, we focus on the UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System). First, we review the interworking scenarios and architecture of 3G and WLAN. Then, we review the standardized authentication protocol for 3G/UMTS and WLAN interworking; moreover, we will review some papers related to the security issues and solutions on interworking between 3G/UMTS and WLAN. We also further make some comparisons to these schemes on their features and performance. Finally, we conclude some future works for the interworking between 3G/UMTS and WLAN.	access network;authentication protocol;computer performance;electronic billing;interoperability;key;point of view (computer hardware company);scott continuity	Chou Chen Yang;Kuan-Hao Chu;Ya-Wen Yang	2006	I.

Some of our observations confirm earlier studies: the major fraction of the total traffic originates from P2P applications and small fractions of connections and clients are responsible for the vast majority of the traffic. However, our main contribution is a throughput performance analysis of the clients. We observe suprisingly low utilizations of upload and download capacity for most of the clients. Furthermore, by using our TCP root cause analysis tool, we obtain a striking result: in over 90% of the cases, the low utilization is mostly due to the (P2P) applications clients use, which limit the transmission rate and not due to network congestion, for instance. P2P applications typically impose upload rate limits to avoid uplink saturation that hurt download performance. Our analysis shows that these rate limits are very low and, as a consequence, the aggregate download rates for these applications are low.	24-hour clock;access network;aggregate data;asymmetric digital subscriber line;byte;call stack;download;network congestion;network packet;peer-to-peer;telecommunications link;throughput;upload	Matti Siekkinen;Denis Collange;Guillaume Urvoy-Keller;Ernst W.

The MEC platform provides services for radio network information, bandwidth management and device location. In this paper, we propose a new mobile edge service that enables 3rd party control on intersystem handover. The proposed service allows authorized applications to initiate device pre-registration in the target access network and then based on application-specific policy to initiate intersystem handover.

Thus, standards and protocols such as the UMTS and Wireless Access Protocol (WAP) should allow any mobile user, in addition to telephony, to navigate the Web, have a videoconference call, etc. However, the integration of services raises a certain number of problems. For example, the advent of new services (such as the Internet) has questioned the traditional traffic models used in the telecommunications world. New models have then been proposed to take into account bursty and self-similar traffic. But in third generation networks, even if several studies have been dedicated to the analysis of the performance of radio technologies, few have been done on the analysis of these networks from an application perspective, when various types of traffic are aggregated. In this paper, the focus is on the performance issues arising in UMTS third-generation wireless networks, subject to voice and video traffics. For that purpose, we adapt existing traffic models or propose new ones, which are based on the UMTS forum specifications and real traffic observations. The models obtained are calibrated and validated by comparison with real traces and used to simulate a UMTS network aggregating various types of traffic. This defines a reference model whose performance was evaluated according to certain metrics of quality of service (QoS). The performance achieved by the implementation is average because the throughputs suggested by the UMTS forum are a little restrictive. It is thus necessary in the design process to carefully define the QoS profiles associated with each class or application. For the streaming class, it would be necessary to install adequate buffers to ensure the quality of service, particularly end-to-end delay. Also, the addition of another QoS management layer has shown to improve the performance. q 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This is a problem for real time communications that heavily rely on transport types like User Datagram Protocol or those associated to the Internet Security Protocol. A mechanism to overcome this limitation is through stream tunneling where media frames that would be typically rejected by firewalls are encapsulated on top of TCP transport. In this paper, a novel mathematical model that links application layer packet loss to bursty network packet loss in the context of fading channels characteristic of wireless communications is presented for both, datagram and stream encapsulation. This model is compared with experimental scenarios of tunneling applied to state of the art speech codecs such that quality scores are obtained and correlated against theoretical results.	encapsulation (networking);real-time clock	Rolando Herrero	2017	Telecommunication Systems	10.1007/s11235-017-0308-1	computer network;datagram transport layer security;computer science;user datagram protocol;transport layer;transmission control protocol;internet protocol suite;tunneling protocol;datagram;jumbogram	Mobile	-4.8876712942899925	96.07171926975822	54835

This article describes an IVC system that combines the best attributes of video conferencing and multi-user virtual environments. It is shown that each participant of IVC has a virtual context that is defined by his/her perspective and perception about the quality and relevance of video and audio of others. The virtual context determines both the visibility status and the required quality of videos of participants. This information can be used to dynamically alter the multicast trees that are formed among clients for the purpose of multimedia dissemination so that only the relevant videos are transmitted to end users. In addition, it is possible to reduce the video quality of a given user in response to the virtual context without the degradation having any perceptual impact. The combination of these factors reduces the required upload and download bandwidth of clients by more than 90 percent on average, making IVC highly scalable to support very large gatherings.	360-degree video;download;elegant degradation;multi-user;multicast;relevance;scalability;upload;virtual reality	Farzad Safaei;Pedram Pourashraf;Daniel Robert Franklin	2014	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2014.6871672	computer vision;computer science;video tracking;multimedia;video processing;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	-8.8124692965035	101.49165620316083	54917

Building upon the TFRC protocol , a new protocol has been designed for estimating the bandwidth prediction model parameters. Making use of RTP and RTCP, this protocol allows to better take into account the multimedia flows characteristics (variable packet size, delay ...). Given the current channel state estimated by the above protocol, encoder and decoder buffers states as well as delay constraints of the real-time video source are translated into encoder rate constraints. This global rate control model, coupled with an H.263+ loss resilient video compression algorithm, has been extensively experimented with on various Internet links. The experiments clearly demonstrate the benefits of 1/ the new protocol used for estimating the bandwidth prediction model parameters, adapted to multimedia flows characteristics, and of 2/ the global rate control model encompassing source buffers and end-to-end delay characteristics. The overall system leads to reduce significantly the source timeouts, hence to minimize the expected distortion, for a comparable usage of the TCP-compatible predicted bandwidth.	algorithm;distortion;encoder;end-to-end principle;experiment;internet;network congestion;network packet;peak signal-to-noise ratio;performance;real-time clock;real-time transcription;timeout (computing);vf bandwidth;whole genome sequencing	Jérôme Viéron;Christine Guillemot	2004	IEEE Transactions on Multimedia	10.1109/TMM.2004.830805	data compression;real-time computing;the internet;simulation;rtp control protocol;computer science;end-to-end delay;predictive modelling;network congestion;transport layer;computer network	Networks	-5.998748327865134	99.34086545797783	54975

The center node employs an optical carrier supply module that generates not only the optical carriers for the downstream signals but also those for the upstream signals. The latter are supplied to optical network units (ONUs) at users' homes/buildings via the network. Since the ONUs simply modulate the optical carriers supplied from the center node via the network, they are wavelength-independent.	access network;gigabit;wavelength-division multiplexing	Junichi Kani;Mitsuhiro Teshima;Koji Akimoto;Noboru Takachio;Hiroo Suzuki;Katsumi Iwatsuki;Motohaya Ishii	2003	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2003.1179497	optical transport network;passive optical network;edge device;optical network unit;optical burst switching;core network;multiwavelength optical networking;parallel optical interface;telecommunications;10g-pon;dark fibre;computer science;optical add-drop multiplexer;optical switch;optical performance monitoring;multi-mode optical fiber;wavelength-division multiplexing;optical cross-connect;computer network;optical carrier transmission rates;optical communications repeater;access network	HPC	-19.599714387099063	89.14891343483409	55007

A cooperation framework is proposed between a high level Service Provider (SP) - managing high level services - and a Content Aware Network Provider (CANP), managing an overlay, multi-domain, transportation network. The virtual CANs are requested by a SP, negotiated with, and realised by the CANP. This cooperation, through online Service Level Agreements, creates a cross-layer optimization loop between the transport, application, and services layers. Inside the VCANs the resources for QoS assurance are assured by static and dynamic provisioning, service differentiation and media flow dynamic adaptation.	ecosystem;high-level programming language;mathematical optimization;provisioning;service-level agreement	Eugen Borcoci;Serban Georgica Obreja;Christian Timmerer;Georgios Xilouris	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo	10.1109/ICME.2011.6012214	service provider;web service;service level requirement;provider edge;service level objective;quality of service;application service provider;business service provider;computer science;service delivery framework;multimedia;customer service assurance;world wide web;computer network	HPC	-14.024661553298603	93.76981738087578	55303

We experiment with three different control techniques: static long-term optimal mapping of flows to LSPs; on-line locally optimal mapping of flows to LSPs at flow set-up time; and dynamic flow migration in response to transient congestion. These techniques are app licable over different timescales, have different run-time overheads, and require different levels of monitoring and control software inside the network. We present results both from detailed simulati ons and a complete implementation using software IP routers. We use Voice-over-IP as our test application, and show that if e nd-toend quality is to be maintained during short unpredictable bursts of high load, then a fast-timescale control such as migratio n is required.	content-control software;local optimum;multiprotocol label switching;network congestion;online and offline;onset (audio);schematic;uptime	Kuo-Tung Kuo;Surapich Phuvoravan;Bobby Bhattacharjee;Richard J.

Second, among the observed traffic characteristics, we particularly focus on the way bandwidth is actually shared by flows and users by developing an empirical bandwidth sharing model. We infer from it some trends shown by the different classes of traffic in terms of elasticity, i.e., their potential reaction against congestion.

4bc9cb4e174ac934cba417400f61df28b07753f2	exact analysis of ttl cache networks	qa76 electronic computers computer science computer software	TTL caching models have recently regained significant research interest due to their connection to popular caching policies such as LRU. This paper advances the state-of-the-art analysis of TTL-based cache networks by developing two exact methods with orthogonal generality and computational complexity. The first method generalizes existing results for line networks under renewal requests to the broad class of caching policies whereby evictions are driven by stopping times; in addition to classical policies used in DNS and web caching, our stopping time model captures an emerging new policy implemented in SDN switches and Amazon web services. The second method further generalizes these results to feedforward networks with Markov arrival process (MAP) requests. MAPs are particularly suitable for non-line networks because they are closed not only under superposition and splitting, as known, but also under caching operations with phase-type (PH) TTL distributions. The crucial benefit of the two closure properties is that they jointly enable the first exact analysis of TTL feedforward cache networks in great generality. Moreover, numerical results highlight that existing Poisson approximations in binary-tree topologies are subject to relative errors as large as 30%, depending on the tree depth.	amazon web services;approximation;binary tree;cpu cache;cache (computing);computational complexity theory;feedforward neural network;markov chain;network switch;numerical analysis;software-defined networking;transistor–transistor logic;web cache;web service	Daniel S.

Furthermore, the volatility present in traffic sent & received by these applications necessitates a predictive solution for effective QoS strategies. To comprehend the tasks faced by cloud providers in this regard, we undertook statistical analysis of traffic traces measured periodically over a week, taking into account its nonstationarity. Henceforth, we developed a model to predict bandwidth utilization applicable in maintaining SLAs for multiple traffic flows at the cloud network edge and core. The developed univariate forecast model employs the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model augmented with a general class of Adaptive Conditional Score Models (ACS). Our motivation for employing the ACS stems from its robust adaptation to outliers & transients more efficiently with increased computational accuracy than current methods; one of such methods being the recently adopted Generalized Auto-Regressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) to model volatility. These are observable typically as flash-crowds, time-of-day load spikes and DDoS events. The model offers improvements in forecasts over ARIMA/GARCH models with a 10-15% increase in predictive accuracy. Based on this model, we present 2 novel bandwidth adaptive algorithms which find application in the cloud network. The first is resident in the application layer of the SDN stack as a controller integrated into the OpenStack cloud environment. It was tested for effectiveness in a small test-bed where it sustains SLAs at 95%. The second methodology has been adapted in ns-2 where we present it as R2CP: Robust Rate Control Protocol, an extension to the Rate Control Protocol (RCP). R2CP offers a 25% reduction in flow completion time over XCP/RCP & over 60% reduction compared to TCP.	algorithm;autoregressive integrated moving average;cloud computing;collocation;computation;denial-of-service attack;dynamic music;observable;provisioning;quality of service;software-defined networking;testbed;tracing (software);volatility	Abiola Adegboyega	2015	2015 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2015.7414021	communications protocol;real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications;forecasting;computer science;operating system;predictive modelling;computational model;computer security;statistics;robustness;computer network	Metrics	-4.62032631129825	96.60858283466398	56369

Although sampling proves to be a promising approach, there are application scenarios foreseen, in which decisions cannot be based on sampled data, e.g., for usage-based charging or intrusion detection systems. Moreover, traditional traffic analysis mechanisms do not map the traffic observed in the network to a particular user, but rather to a particular end-node, which may have been shared by several users. Thus, DARTA (Distributed Architecture for Real-time Traffic Analysis) develops a model for distributed IP traffic analysis and introduces new mechanisms for three different aspects in IP traffic monitoring: (a) a framework enabling the development of distributed traffic analysis applications, (b) a distributed packet capture mechanism, (c) an user-based IP traffic accounting for mapping IP traffic to individual users.	distributed computing;emoticon;intrusion detection system;network packet;packet analyzer;real-time clock;real-time transcription;sampling (signal processing);scalability;traffic analysis	Cristian Morariu;Burkhard Stiller	2010			traffic generation model;intrusion detection system;traffic policing;network traffic control;real-time computing;floating car data;computer science;traffic congestion reconstruction with kerner's three-phase theory;insync adaptive traffic control system;traffic shaping;computer security;internet traffic engineering;computer network	Security	-9.20602984440101	92.9288070562068	56941

The proposed techniques aim to support the resource efficient delivery of on-demand content to end users in a timely manner. Within the proposed framework, a cooperative transmission strategy suggests that users who have access to the requested content cooperatively transmit to the targeted set of users. In doing so, we can minimize the servicing requirements at the server side and improve the scalability performance in the network. We conducted extensive simulations and showed that significant performance improvements can be achieved with the proposed delivery techniques to enable efficient access to an ever growing on-demand content. We also showed the robustness of the proposed techniques in regard to variations observed in network state.

In the transition to IP-based cellular networks, it is widely agreed that Mobile IP provides an elegant solution for inter-domain, or macro- mobility management, but lacks critical aspects of mobility management needed within cellular networks. The shortcomings have led to the recent emergence of micro- mobility management protocols. This paper presents an IP- based mobility management protocol, µ-Mobile IP, based on two enhancements, proactive handoff and paging support, to an Internet Draft proposal Regional Registrations. A signaling cost analysis is used to justify the need for such enhancements. We show through simulations the protocol's suitability for supporting real-time communications.

However, current DiffServ specifications have limitations in providing the complete QoS management framework. This paper pro- poses a policy-based QoS management framework that supports DiffServ policy beans for managing QoS of DiffServ networks. The management framework is based on IETF policy framework to which EJB technolo- gies are adopted. High-level DiffServ QoS policies are represented as valid XML documents with an XML Schema and are translated to low-level EJB policy beans in the EJB-based policy server. The EJB-based policy server can accomplish both policy distribution and QoS monitoring by using SNMP DiffServ MIB.	differentiated services;quality of service	Si-Ho Cha;Jae-Oh Lee;Dong-Ho Lee;Kuk-Hyun Cho	2003		10.1007/978-3-540-45235-5_87	xml;computer science;database;world wide web;computer network	Embedded	-13.962590778563307	94.74039019818197	57546

The end-to-end FEC protection schemes over-allocate FEC redundancy to each link and may induce a self-congestion effect in a link. The hop-by-hop FEC protection scheme incurs a long end-to-end delay that harms the video performance at the video receiver. Accordingly, the Adaptive Multi-Hop FEC (AM-FEC) protection scheme is proposed in this paper to improve the quality of video streaming data over Wireless Mesh Networks by means of simultaneously minimizing the end-to-end delay and reducing the FEC computational cost. The AM-FEC protection scheme uses a heuristic algorithm to minimize the number of FEC-encoded segments between the video sender and receiver. Moreover, according to the decodable frame rate the AM-FEC protection scheme can dynamically adjust FEC redundancy on each link to outperform end-to-end FEC protection schemes and hop-by-hop FEC protection schemes. In the experiments, the AM-FEC protection scheme achieves timely loss recovery for delay-sensitive video streaming and outperforms traditional FEC protection schemes in terms of video peak signal-to-noise ratio.

VoIP offers high-rate voice services at low cost with good flexibility, typically in a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN). In a voice conversation, each client works either as a sender or a receiver depending on the direction of traffic flow over the network. A VoIP technologically requires high throughput, less packet loss and a high fairness index over the network. The packets of VoIP streaming may experience drops because of competition among the different kinds of traffic flow over the network. A VoIP application is also sensitive to delays and requires voice packets to arrive on time from the sender to the receiver without any delay over a WLAN. To date, scheduling of VoIP traffic is still an unresolved problem. The objectives of this survey paper are to discuss fundamental principles of VoIP-related schedulers and identify current scheduler issues. This survey paper also identifies the importance of the scheduling techniques over WLANs. Related research work for real-time applications specifically for VoIP will also be highlighted.

While Asymmetric DSL (ADSL) technology continues to see the predominate share of access lines, Very high speed DSL (VDSL) has been in development for several years and has yet to overtake ADSL in the marketplace. While the increase in broadband communication demand has certainly fueled the growth of DSL, the deployment of the management protocol defined by the DSL Forum in Technical Report 69 (TR-69) offers the greatest potential for further increasing the speed by which deployments take place. With so much broadband communication technology available worldwide, are there other factors that should be considered to elongate DSL's hold on broadband into the future? We will attempt to consider the technology and the future of DSL by examining some of the historical advances that have led to DSL's existing success.	asymmetric digital subscriber line;last mile;software deployment	Scott Valcourt	2007	2007 Second International Conference on Access Networks & Workshops	10.1109/ACCESSNETS.2007.4447104	dsl filter;adsl loop extender;digital subscriber line;high-bit-rate digital subscriber line;internet access;telecommunications;dsl modem;computer science;symmetric digital subscriber line;asymmetric digital subscriber line;digital subscriber line access multiplexer;single-pair high-speed digital subscriber line;computer network;broadband networks	Arch	-18.678834270823387	93.8220420217495	58141

The application model and the application QoS for the protocol are also proposed. The application QoS for each connection includes the maximum allowable ratio of the lost medium unit and the delay bound of the medium unit associated with the maximum allowable late rati o. The control mechanisms that support the application protocol include error control, real-time control for individual connection within the session, and synchronization control for the multimedia session. Moreover, the application protocol with the control mechanisms provides a quantitative expression for the quality of the synchronized session in terms of the QoS parameters.

The advent of Hotspot 2.0, enhanced Wi-Fi quality of service (QoS) techniques, and transparent authentication mechanisms between mobile and Wi-Fi networks will pave the way for seamless mobility and roaming between these two technologies and provide a better quality of experience to the end user. With web-based applications like Skype, Google Talk, and WhatsApp becoming mainstream media for communication, operators are looking at the combination of licensed band and Wi-Fi technologies to meet capacity demands. This paper discusses the evolution of basic network Wi-Fi -based hotspots to become the trusted partner of mobile operators.

Previous researchers have written high level behavioral simulation models to study the sources and the characteristics of this jitter. These behavioral simulation models have fast run times but do not accurately model the jitter sources. The modelsu0027 sampling rates are too low to capture the frame structure effects which can occur at up to 19.44 MHz. This paperu0027s simulation model takes a more detailed approach than previous behavioral simulations by modelling the network at a bit-by-bit level via event driven simulation.

As wireless networks become an integral component of the modern communication infrastructure, energy efficiency will be an important design consideration due to the limited battery life of mobile terminals. Power conservation techniques are commonly used in the hardware design of such systems. Since the network interface is a significant consumer of power, considerable research has been devoted to low-power design of the entire network protocol stack of wireless networks in an effort to enhance energy efficiency. This paper presents a comprehensive summary of recent work addressing energy efficient and low-power design within all layers of the wireless network protocol stack.	communications protocol;low-power broadcasting;network interface;protocol stack	Christine E.

The edge router with sleep mode consists of multiple line cards, multiple OBS line cards, a SCU(Switch Control Unit) and an electronic switch fabric. The OBS line card, which is the main part of edge router, performs the functions of edge router such as BCP(Burst Control Packet) and burst assembly, BCP scheduling and sleep mode. In OBS line card, it is possible to reduce energy consumption by controlling PHY/Transceiver module from active state to sleep state for burst assembling by using sleep mode. In order to evaluate the energy saving performance of the OBS edge router with sleep mode, the power consumption is analyzed according to the datasheet of packet router and optical device. And, simulation by using OPNET is also performed in terms of sleep time and average queuing delay.	optical burst switching;router (computing);sleep mode	Won-Hyuk Yang;Mohamed A.

There are many advantages of IPTV deployment over current digital or air broadcast TV signals: integration, the use of the switched internet protocol (IP), the possibility to build home networks that can be used to share multimedia contents over different devices, the easy implementation of video on demand services and the usage of better compression and encryption standards. In order to implement this kind of service, it is extremely useful to have a system that can efficiently classify multimedia contents and users and distribute them in a customized way. This paper proposes a novel IPTV service for the distribution of personalized multimedia contents over IP networks based on the concept of content-zapping, in contrast to traditional channel-zapping: each client system receives a multimedia streaming that is automatically composed by the system based on the user preferences and the user will only interact with the system by requesting a content change or marking a content as favorite. The paper will describe the general functionality of the service and will present the detailed architecture of the IPTV server, the key component of the service infrastructure. The server must maintain a list of media contents residing in other systems and must keep a dynamic classification of the multimedia contents that are stored in its database. This classification is built and gradually refined based on the interactions between clients and multimedia contents. Special attention is given in the paper to the classification model, describing the general ideas that are used to automatically suggest multimedia contents to a specific user (that is characterized by his complete profile). A specific content may be suggested to the user based on the knowledge of the user profile and/or based on specific and dynamic information, such as the user position, the local temperature, date and time. The availability of this information obviously depends on the specific user device that is being used. The proposed system allows any client device to connect, allowing a high level of interoperability. It is also possible to use all the device capabilities and sensors, like Global Positioning System (GPS), accelerometers, light sensors, noise sensors, etc., thus creating a context environment that helps classify each user profile. These context-awareness mechanisms applied to mobile devices with wireless network (802.11b/g/n, WiMAX, GSM, UMTS, etc.) capabilities allow a better user experience and more accurate multimedia suggestions, due to the deep knowledge about the user device, network and environment. The system also allows the users to suggest contents to other users in the same “group of friends”. Several performance tests were already conducted and the results obtained show that the proposed system is very stable and fast, even for high increases on the number of users.	broadcast television systems;centralized computing;content-control software;context awareness;encryption;global positioning system;high-level programming language;iptv;interaction;internet;interoperability;item unique identification;mathematical optimization;mobile device;performance;personalization;real-time web;sensor;server (computing);software deployment;streaming media;user (computing);user experience;user profile	João Rodrigues;António Nogueira;Paulo Salvador;Joel Jos&#x00E9; P.

Amongst many QoS guarantee schemes, Diffserv (Differentiated Services) is the one of the most practical candidates for the next generation IP networks. Under these circumstances, the commercial network venders have already provided the Diffserv routers that support EF (Expedited Forwarding) PHB (Per Hop Behavior). However, AF (Assured Forwarding) PHB in Diffserv still has not been provided by commercial routers. Therefore, it is a realistic solution that SBR3 (Statistical Bit Rate 3) of ATM emulates AF PHB, but it is not clear whether TCP traffic over AF PHB emulated by ATM is differentiated from the best effort TCP traffic over DF (Default Forwarding) PHB. To confirm the differentiation, we have experimentally studied TCP performance through the link into which TCP connections over AF PHB and DF PHB are aggregated. This paper describes the experimental results and discusses the possibility of the TCP performance differentiation between AF PHB and DF PHB over ATM.	atm turbo;anisotropic filtering;differentiated services;performance evaluation;standard business reporting	Shigehiro Ano;Toru Hasegawa;Nicolas Decre	2002	Telecommunication Systems	10.1023/A:1013850707717	best-effort delivery;real-time computing;tcp global synchronization;quality of service;telecommunications;differentiated service;computer science;transmission control protocol;zeta-tcp;tcp acceleration;differentiated services;computer network	HPC	-5.478797607294093	93.95348377898875	59042

The evaluation results of the prototype implementation show that SCTP is very suitable for transport layer handovers and more robust against interferences than TCP. 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The high bandwidth required could be somewhat alleviated through high efficiency video coding, but this does not guarantee that quality of service (QoS) thresholds are met. To help with the varying network conditions of cellular environments, adaptive bitrate (ABR) solutions in an Over-The-Top (OTT) fashion provide a possible solution. This paper focuses on the medium access control (MAC) scheduler for transmission of MVV content over an LTE network. MPEG-DASH's features are considered as the basis of the ABR solution. Simulation results show reduced packet losses and increased numbers in concurrent users, compared to a non-ABR solution. Moreover, to improve the video quality, each main view was prioritized through the Evolved Packet System (EPS) bearer to better protect this content and its decodability.	access control;boulder dash;compaq lte;data compression;error concealment;high efficiency video coding;imperative programming;mpeg transport stream;mobile device;moving picture experts group;network packet;quality of service;scheduling (computing);simulation	Gilbert Savona;Carl J.

An Ultra Flat Architecture (UFA), based on SIP and designed with the primary goal of being scalable, has been introduced in a previous paper. In this paper, the limitations of current 3GPP architectures are discussed and detailed explanations of UFA interest and procedures are provided. UFA is entirely controlled by the operator and integrates QoS in its establishment and mobility procedures. To prove its concept and assess the performance of its mobility procedure, UFA is implemented on a testbed. UFA HO delay measured at the application level is 100ms in average; it is 12 times smaller than in a classic SIP-based mobility scheme.	centralisation;information management system (ims);network architecture;requirement;scalability;testbed;unambiguous finite automaton	Khadija Daoud;Philippe Herbelin;Karine Guillouard;Noël Crespi	2009	2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5450117	embedded system;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	-13.007351814156745	90.65666243234018	59703

Abstract This document describes providing Call Transfer capabilities in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). SIP extensions such as REFER and Replaces are used to provide a number of transfer services including blind transfer, consultative transfer, and attended transfer. This work is part of the SIP multiparty call control framework. 1. Overview This document describes providing Call Transfer capabilities and requirements in SIP [RFC3261]. This work is part of the multiparty call control framework [CC-FRMWRK]. The mechanisms discussed here are most closely related to traditional, basic, and consultation hold transfers. This document details the use of the REFER method [RFC3515] and Replaces [RFC3891] header field to achieve call transfer. A User Agent (UA) that fully supports the transfer mechanisms described in this document supports REFER [RFC3515] and Replaces [RFC3891] in addition to RFC 3261 [RFC3261]. A User Agent should use a Contact URI that meets the requirements in Section 8.1.1.8 of RFC 3261. A compliant User Agent supports the Target-Dialog header field [RFC4538]. 2. Actors and Roles There are three actors in a given transfer event, each playing one of the following roles: Transferee: the party being transferred to the Transfer Target. Transferor: the party initiating the transfer. Transfer Target: the new party being introduced into a call with the Transferee. The following roles are used to describe transfer requirements and scenarios: Originator: wishes to place a call to the Recipient. This actor is the source of the first INVITE in a session, to either a Facilitator or a Screener. Facilitator: receives a call or out-of-band request from the Originator, establishes a call to the Recipient through the Screener, and connects the Originator to the Recipient.

We show how some of the econometric measures can meaningfully capture the user decisions/actions (e.g., churning) that can potentially be utilized by the providers in managing radio resources (e.g., bandwidth) in wireless data networks. In particular, by modeling the interaction between a service provider and its customers (or users) as a non-cooperative game, we propose a novel cross-layer resource management framework for integrated admission and rate control in CDMA networks. Analytical and simulation results demonstrate how the proposed framework can help minimize customer churning and maximize revenue for the wireless operators, yet optimizing customer satisfaction by providing differentiated quality of service to different classes of users.	algorithm;e-services;econometric model;floor and ceiling functions;money;nash equilibrium;network planning and design;quality of service;simulation;software deployment;theory;weatherstar	Sajal K.

A network protocol, designed to control access to the network by the users, currently uses a purely random technique for recovering from an error situation. The network protocol is called carrier sense multiple access with collision detect, or csma / cd . It is used in local area networks to control access to the network medium. We will describe an expert system that will consider the situation and determine the most appropriate response based on the current state of the network and the information in its knowledge base. We first give an overview of the problem, followed by explanatory chapters on local area networks and expert systems, including a section on fuzzy expert systems. Then the unique characteristics of the problem are reviewed, and a sketch of the solution is developed. This is followed by a detailed description of the model for the expert system. Finally, there is a discussion on the results including problems encountered, conclusions on the application, and suggestions for future research.	access control;expert system	Ruth Anne Maule;Abraham Kandel	1985	Inf.

Unfortunately, this source-based rate-adaptation performs poorly in a heterogeneous multicast environment because there is no single target rate --- the conflicting bandwidth requirements of all receivers cannot be simultaneously satisfied with one transmission rate. If the burden of rate-adaption is moved from the source to the receivers, heterogeneity is accommodated. One approach to receiver-driven adaptation is to combine a layered source coding algorithm with a layered transmission system. By selectively forwarding subsets of layers at constrained network links, each user receives the best quality signal that the network can deliver. We and others have proposed that selective-forwarding be carried out using multiple IP-Multicast groups where each receiver specifies its level of subscription by joining a subset of the groups. In this paper, we extend the multiple group framework with a rate-adaptation protocol called Receiver-driven Layered Multicast, or RLM. Under RLM, multicast receivers adapt to both the static heterogeneity of link bandwidths as well as dynamic variations in network capacity (i.e., congestion). We describe the RLM protocol and evaluate its performance with a preliminary simulation study that characterizes user-perceived quality by assessing loss rates over multiple time scales. For the configurations we simulated, RLM results in good throughput with transient short-term loss rates on the order of a few percent and long-term loss rates on the order of one percent. Finally, we discuss our implementation of a software-based Internet video codec and its integration with RLM.	algorithm;codec;data compression;multicast;network congestion;real-time transcription;requirement;simulation;throughput	Steven McCanne;Van Jacobson;Martin Vetterli	1996		10.1145/248156.248168	real-time computing;multicast;ip multicast;telecommunications;protocol independent multicast;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;source-specific multicast;xcast;computer network;satisfiability;source code	Networks	-6.465971042995784	101.97486411914382	60001

However, not much thinking has been invested yet on how this replacement could take place. We assume that the simplest and most attractive approach is a native co-existence of the two architectures in dualstacks. In this case CCN's dynamics need to withstand TCP's aggressiveness in occupying network capacity, and at the same time not be overly aggressive itself, which would create instability to the current TCP-dominated Internet. Starting from this premise, we implemented an AIMD strategy for controlling the pipeline of Interests, which is compatible with TCP's behaviour. We test variants of this strategy against TCP on a native CCN deployment and we report on issues of such a strategy for the CCN philosophy. Our main observation is that such an approach has the potential to bring the two protocols to a (statistical) fair sharing of the capacity. However, unless strong assumptions are made, a temporal estimator (such as RTOs) for controlling the Interest pipeline is ill-suited for CCN's content multi-homing semantics. Unfortunately, such assumptions are not possible in lack of empirical usage and traffic patterns from a large-scale CCN deployment.	cyclomatic complexity;future internet;instability;internet protocol suite;multihoming;multiple homing;software deployment	Stefan Braun;Massimo Monti;Manolis Sifalakis;Christian F.

The purpose of the domain is to provide naming conventions that identify US Federal government agencies in order to facilitate access to their electronic resources. This memo provides guidance for registrations by Federal Agencies that avoids name duplication and facilitates responsiveness to the public. It restricts registrations to coincide with the approved structure of the US government and the advice of its Chief Information Officers.

The latter document may be subject to more timely updates than the former. Either document is suitable for determining which entities qualify for second-level domain registration within .GOV and FED.US. As a side effect, this RFC reduces the number of .GOV and FED.US level registrations and reduces the workload on the registration authority.

Previous studies have identified some potential impact on performance where transitions occur. This study considered implementations where Quality of Service (QoS) service policies have been applied in the IPv6 network to determine if the transition mechanisms were able to guarantee the same performance and level of service when the IPv6 traffic transitions over a core IPv4 network. Using a test lab, traffic generators and data capture tools the study was able to fully test the transition mechanisms using data rates and link speeds that replicated equipment and traffic levels used in real world implementations. The study showed that the Quality of Service classes applied were maintained across the transition network providing the service guarantees required for a range of traffic classes. Results indicated that the transition implementations on the devices used (Cisco ISR 4351) translate the QoS settings from IPv6 to IPV4 and vice versa were highly effective and with negligible additional impact on performance occurring due to the additional processing required.	core data;information systems research;quality of service	Luke Smith;Malte Jacobi;Samir Al-Khayatt	2018	2018 11th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP)	10.1109/CSNDSP.2018.8471772	quality of service;implementation;level of service;network topology;ipv6;ipv4;versa;computer network;computer science;end-to-end principle	Metrics	-6.147755520158989	92.3071549669797	60592

Specifically, LAN, WLAN, ADSL and UMTS network connections are evaluated by means of both PCs and mobile terminals. The end- to-end delay is below 150 ms in all cases, so it does not degrade the call quality (in the case of no echo loss in the path). The traffic patterns of Skype were also studied for uplink/downlink, private/public addresses, which node initiates the call, and what kind of terminal is used. Additionally, PESQ measurements reveal that Skype calls are above the minimum acceptable quality when using PC-based nodes, whereas quality is not acceptable when using mobile terminals. The effect of the CPU load of the mobile terminal on the perceived call quality has also been analyzed.	asymmetric digital subscriber line;central processing unit;mobile phone;pesq;telecommunications link	Marc Cardenete-Suriol;Josep Mangues-Bafalluy;Álvaro Masó;Mónica Gorricho	2007	IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.414	radio access network;embedded system;mobile identification number;3g;wireless wan;mobile web;digital subscriber line;imt advanced;public land mobile network;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;mobile station;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	-8.019075860280644	91.88152988565409	60618

However, some feel that protocols based on the open systems interconnection (OSI) model and promulgated by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) will eventually achieve dominance and enjoy even greater success than TCP/IP. The author explores methods for transition and coexistence between the two protocol suites. He enumerates several approaches, discusses the positive and negative aspects of each, and describes their inter-relationships. Further, although the focus is on the problems of Internet/OSI transition and coexistence, none of the approaches described are unique to this problem. Rather, they are all general solutions to the problem of changing from one protocol suite to another or of having two arbitrary protocol suites coexisting. >	coexist (image);internet protocol suite;osi model	Marshall T.

Modeled is a city environment, where the focus is made on the inter-system handovers between the different wireless systems and how they are affected by the change of different parameters. The results show that inter-system handovers will react differently dependent on what type of handover that is investigated. The results can be used to analyze the influence of mobility, as well as service demands. This can be an effective way to dimensioning cooperating wireless systems and to analyze the effect of introducing a new service or application.	simulation	Henrik Persson;Roland Zander;Johan M.

The benefit of multi-homed networks is to improve the quality-of-service (QoS) of communications through dynamically selecting appropriate communications media. Multi-homed networks can improve long-term QoS through dynamically switching appropriate media. However, the instantaneous effect of media switching will degrade short-term QoS. Media handover degrades the QoS not only of the handover flow itself but also of the flows to be merged. A real-time flow in narrow bandwidth communications media will particularly be affected by the media handover of a TCP flow with a large window. Therefore, we propose media-handover-aware TCP mechanisms to attain high-quality real-time communications, which adjust the size of the TCP's transmission window corresponding to the change in bandwidth using a signal to notify of media handover. Through simulations, we evaluated and analyzed our proposed mechanisms.	acknowledgement (data networks);bandwidth (signal processing);display resolution;exptime;elegant degradation;multihoming;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time transcription;simulation;throughput;time complexity	Hiroki Baba;Hiroyuki Koga;Katsuyoshi Iida;Katsunori Yamaoka;Yoshinori Sakai	2007	Third IEEE International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob 2007)	10.1109/WIMOB.2007.47	real-time computing;tcp global synchronization;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;zeta-tcp;tcp acceleration;computer network	Embedded	-6.820359975268418	98.09302508446872	60761

Though broadband internet connectivity will not be universally available in the short-term, widely-employed mobile devices coupled with novel delay-tolerant networking do allow limited forms of connectivity. This paper explores the design space for internet access systems operating with constrained connectivity. Our starting point is C-LINK, a collaborative caching system that enhances the performance of interactive web access over DTN and cellular connectivity. We discuss our experiences and results from deploying C-LINK in Nicaragua, before moving on to a broader design study of other issues that further influence operation. We consider the impact of (i) storing web content collaboratively cached across all user nodes, (ii) hybrid transport layers exploiting the best attributes of limited cellular and DTN-style connectivity. We also explore the behavior of future systems under a range of usage and mobility scenarios. Even under adverse conditions, our techniques can improve average service latency for page requests by a factor of 2X. Our results point to the considerable power of leveraging user mobility and collaboration in providing very-low-infrastructure internet access to developing regions.	cpu cache;coda (file system);computer networks (journal);delay-tolerant networking;dial-up internet access;fletcher's checksum;gps wildlife tracking;ieee/acm transactions on networking;information access;integrated services digital network;m. satyanarayanan;mobile device;operating system;peer-to-peer;proxy server;rover (the prisoner);scalability;software deployment;www;web cache;web content;web page;world wide web	Sibren Isaacman;Margaret Martonosi	2011		10.1145/1963192.1963361	computer science;delay-tolerant networking;database;internet privacy;information technology;world wide web;computer network	Metrics	-14.845610400772342	90.12292535451849	60937

A number of commercial container implementations conforming to the current 1.0 specification are available; they provide feature rich and robust environments where a wealth of SIP applications can provide flexible control logic for advanced telecommunications applications. However, while one of the stated goals of the SIP servlet API is to support application composition, it is optional and not standardized in the 1.0 specification. In this paper, the authors propose an application composition framework that is general, powerful, and yet shields developers of individual applications from the complexities of application composition and feature interaction. Such a framework promotes modularity and application reuse. Also presented here are the results of implementing this framework on top of 1.0 implementations. This framework is being standardized for the new 1.1 SIP Servlet specification as part of the JCP JSR 289 process.	application programming interface;feature interaction problem;java community process;java servlet;robustness (computer science)	Eric Cheung;K.

One successful example is the ever popular i-Mode in Japan. Wireless data services (wireless Internet) become more important as more and more customers of handheld devices enjoy the convenience of the ubiquitous computing. To improve the effective wireless data access, the time-to-live (TTL) management for data entries becomes important due to its use in effective caching design. In this paper, we study three TTL prediction schemes and investigate the effects of the inter-update time distribution on the wireless data access. Performance analysis is carried out via simulations as well as analytical modeling.

In the current stage, mobile 3D video is usually distributed over the error-prone and heterogeneous network which consists of wire-line and wireless channels. In such applications, the transcoding plays an important role to provide the adaptive and error-resilient bit-stream to the wireless channel. To guarantee the high quality mobile 3D video streaming, this paper proposes a transcoding framework with error-resilient video/depth rate allocation, which utilizes the multi-pass re-encodings to build a rate allocation table (Rate-QP-PLR (packet loss rate) table). Through looking up the table, the proposed framework can select the optimal transcoding quantization parameters (QPs) of video and depth to obtain the error-resilient 3D video transmission and therefore it can make the encoded stream adapt to the transition from wire-line to wireless network. Experimental results show that the proposed 3D video transcoding framework can provide the superior rate-distortion performance for the mobile 3D video streaming.	anytime algorithm;bitstream;cognitive dimensions of notations;display resolution;distortion;mobile 3d graphics api;network packet;public lending right;streaming media	Yanwei Liu;Song Ci;Hui Tang;Yun Ye	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2012.6363901	real-time computing;the internet;transcoding;telecommunications;computer science;video tracking;computer network	Mobile	-7.567968857396235	100.96737068658285	62172

Due to the scalability limitations of traditional TCP algorithms, a plethora of new high-speed TCP congestion control algorithms have been proposed and deployed. Having no standards to follow, these algorithms are ad hoc fixes and some of them have been adopted by various operating system vendors. This begs the question of whether these heterogeneous TCP algorithms are fair or compatible both to each other and to the traditional TCP algorithm. Our simulation study shows that most of the TCP algorithms are surprisingly highly unfair to each other or to the traditional TCP algorithm under several well-known queue management (QM) schemes. This calls for new approaches to QM schemes, and a recently proposed QM scheme, AFpFT, is hence included in the study. Promisingly, AFpFT helps battle the TCP heterogeneity and enforce fairness among the various considered TCP variants. We believe this study sheds new lights on TCP and QM designs.	algorithm;fairness measure;hoc (programming language);internet;network congestion;operating system;scalability;simulation;tcp congestion control;upwind scheme	Addisu Eshete;Yuming Jiang;Lars Landmark	2012		10.1145/2402599.2402605	tcp westwood;compound tcp;tcp congestion-avoidance algorithm;tcp delayed acknowledgment;real-time computing;tcp global synchronization;tcp westwood plus;tcp pacing;telecommunications;choke;computer science;bic tcp;tcp hole punching;transmission control protocol;h-tcp;tcp vegas;zeta-tcp;cubic tcp;hstcp;tcp tuning;tcp acceleration;tcp friendly rate control;slow-start;computer network	Metrics	-4.845874301900221	93.45371488176875	62206

The processes in th~s model are mapped to the Telecommunication Management Network(TMN) Model. Two interfacels in this Process Model have been defined, Usage Accoimting Interface(UA1) and Usage Metering Interface(UM1’). Usage Accounting Interface is for between Service Providers(SP) and Network Providers(NP). It is designed in the pro tocol-independent manner. TINA-C’ s tools such as Object Pehition Language(0DL) are used in the interface specification. Usage Metering Interface is and Usage Metering Interface between NP and EP. A SP may interface with many NPs, SPs, and Customers. For example, a billing SP may need to collect usage information fiom a wireline carrier and a wireless carrier(nationa1 or even international level). Similarly an equipment provider may make switch equipment for dfferent types of carriers(e.g., FR, ATM, SMDS). Thus there is an urgent necessity of having uniform interfaces for both. for between Network Providers(NP) and Equipment Providers(EP). And it is designed for the B-ICI(Broadband End&End Bang process Model ISDN Intkr-Carrier Interface) environment wheie multiple carriers using ATM as underlymg technology provide broadband services.

The integrated Network Function Virtualization (NFV) concept is utilized to support the proposed solution. This maximizes the usage of existing bandwidths by using unlicensed spectrum bandwidth instead of licensed RF spectrum to support a larger number of smartphones and data plans. Several Quality of Service (QoS) metrics are introduced to validate the proposed solution using different voice codecs and are compared to LTE QoS metrics for voice communication to verify that the proposed solution is reliable. As a result, the G 711 u-law voice codec is found to provide the optimum performance.	codec;compaq lte;g.711;hidden line removal;moore's law;network function virtualization;quality of service;scalability;smartphone;speech coding	Lina Abou Haibeh;Nadir Hakem	2017	2017 IEEE 8th Annual Ubiquitous Computing, Electronics and Mobile Communication Conference (UEMCON)	10.1109/UEMCON.2017.8249103	multimedia;computer network;spectrum management;codec;session initiation protocol;quality of service;scalability;computer science;mobile computing;cellular network;server	Mobile	-13.664896305252457	92.10897645538523	62282

Provided service is required to be served with selectable levels of service quality. There is available quite extensive range of wireless technologies provided either by public providers or privately. Described expectations lead to multi-path solutions where different wireless services are combined and selection of the best possible alternative is based on L3/L2 switching supported by different system level of the decision processes. Such approach is supported by ISO/CEN activities usually called as CALM family of standards. Relevant decisions must be based on deep understanding of applied technologies and precisely quantified requirements on system as well as subsystems performance indicators tolerance range. These limits are identified with aim to keep service provisioning on appropriate quality level with minimal impact of continuously changed conditions in time and served area. To cover identified system requirements each applied technology must be studied in detail to identify specific available performance indicators as well as their internal interactions to be able to monitor and manage each technology on appropriate quality level. This paper presents results of GSM data services laboratory measurement. Obtained results are compared with results of already published WiMax service analysis. These two access technologies belong definitely to the core alternatives applied within ITS and presented analysis represents necessary basis for future ITS CALM based system implementations.	interaction;provisioning;requirement;seamless3d;secure communication;system requirements;telematics	Michal Vosatka;Tomas Zelinka	2009		10.1145/1551722.1551752	embedded system;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;performance indicator;database;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Visualization	-17.776400858794215	91.93930065635749	62505

In such hybrid systems, a peer’s upload bandwidth utilization is critical to P2P mode, thus the bandwidth allocation algorithm is important to the performance of VoD streaming. The current research either makes impractical assumptions, or is inefficient in real scenarios. Meanwhile some industrial practice such as additiveincrease/multiplicative-decrease (AIMD) heuristic, although effective in practice, lacks theoretical foundation. This paper develops an optimal bandwidth allocation algorithm for hybrid VoD streaming. Specifically, we propose a novel Demand Driven Max-Flow Formulation, which treats each peer’s bandwidth demand as the flow commodity. The proposed distributed Free-for-All Push-Lift algorithm can solve the formulation in each peer, and is free of any lock, shared memory and atomic operation. Following the theoretical analysis, we implement the algorithms in real-world VoD streaming systems. Through extensive evaluations we demonstrate that our approach can provide high-quality bandwidth allocation for hybrid VoD systems.	algorithm;content delivery network;heuristic;hybrid system;linearizability;maximum flow problem;peer-to-peer;requirement;scheduling (computing);shared memory;system requirements;upload;while	Chen Tian;Jingdong Sun;Weimin Wu;Yan Luo	2015	Computer Networks	10.1016/j.comnet.2015.08.049	maximum flow problem;distributed algorithm;real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network;bandwidth allocation	Metrics	-9.475711839780375	95.54300585408748	62555

The existing public and government-based telephone systems provide three essential communication services: an emergency calling system, which the public uses to report problems and ask for help; emergency communications, which allow for crisis communications within agencies and between agencies and the public; and emergency alerting, which provides a channel for government agencies to notify the public when disasters occur. As we transition to a packet-switched infrastructure, we must reconsider how to provide these services. Internet-based communications offer new challenges, as old assumptions about trust, operation, and terminal location no longer hold. However, IPbased emergency services will also offer expanded services, more resilient networks, and faster response times. About half a dozen companies are offering commercial voice-over-IP services at this time, for both commercial and residential customers. It appears likely that the transition to an all-IP phone service will be slow, as depreciation intervals for switches are measured in decades. However, third-generation wireless systems (3G) are scheduled to offer packet voice services by 2005, adding possibly hundreds of millions of such devices to the network. As the “Emergency Communications” sidebar describes, the existing Internet architecture must be modified in two areas to support coordinated communication services. Here, however, our primary focus is on emergency calling and notification. In this article, we describe the components of the existing emergency calling and notification systems and our proposed IPbased architectures,1 each of which uses the session initiation protocol (SIP) as the signaling framework.2	authentication;computer security;event (computing);internet;network packet;network switch;notification system;packet switching;prototype;proxy server;server (computing);user agent	Henning Schulzrinne;Knarig Arabshian	2002	IEEE Internet Computing	10.1109/MIC.2002.1003130	communications protocol;the internet;sip trunking;computer science;network congestion;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Networks	-19.117687102719064	93.75653717292852	62564
4e7b3755572edd1bce818ef5e62e58970f646bf3	caracterização do comportamento de usuários e precificação de tráfego de internet de banda larga		Broadband user behavior characterization can lead to better understanding and identifying different classes of users, defined by user request patterns. This characterization could help broadband carriers capacity management and planning efforts. Different service request patterns require different service prices. Nevertheless, the main pricing scheme used by broadband ISPs (Internet Service Providers) is the flat rate pricing with limited peak bandwidth, which does not consider different user behavior patterns. This scheme does not guarantee fairness because it encourages resource wasting and, as a consequence, light users end up subsidizing heavy users. A fair pricing scheme, which fosters balanced resource consumption, could save bandwidth and user’s money. Saving resources allows the increase of subscriptions, which could improve ISP profit. This work propose a Internet broadband pricing scheme based on user behavior during the day (BPS – Broadband Pricing Scheme), which is fair to users and profitable for ISP. The reason to create this scheme is based on the results of broadband user behavior characterization with a proposed methodology and real data from an ISP. The validation and the comparison of proposed scheme with other showed in literature are done through the simulation with the same real data used in broadband user behavior characterization. Started from the characterization with real data, this work shows that BPS fosters fair Internet use and optimizes ISP resources re-distributing the workload during hours of day. The simulation of the proposed scheme and others from the literature shows that BPS is a fairner scheme than others, mainly, because utility function used to calculate user benefits is greater or equal zero in almost hours of day. Furthermore, simulation results shows that	fairness measure;flat rate;ibm basic programming support;internet;simulation;utility	Humberto Torres Marques-Neto	2008				Metrics	-15.85716724903872	100.07070382872311	62808

Some information models, as well as transport and policy representation protocols, have been designed. The content of policies, a topic a bit neglected until now, has to answer ISPs and their customers’ requirements for the definition of new value-added services. The proposal made by the IETF consists in configuring individually some network interfaces, rather than in globally managing the services. This approach has contributed to mark the difference between the service definition agreement and the network equipment configuration parameters. In this paper, we propose a policy-based service management architecture. This architecture eases the ISP implementation and management of the services it offers. Quality of Service is an area of experimentation for this architecture. Besides, this architecture gives ISP customers the possibility to carefully control their network quality of service.	access network;information model;netpbm format;personalization;quality of service;requirement;testbed	Olivier Corre;Idir Fodil;Vladimir Ksinant;Guy Pujolle	2003		10.1007/978-3-540-39404-4_25	enterprise architecture framework;service provider;network management;reference architecture;element management system;space-based architecture;network architecture;quality of service;telecommunications;information model;service management;computer science;access control;network interface;service;solution architecture;computer security;service quality;added value;access network	Networks	-14.312874304989643	94.93401775028644	62934

And we also analyze the costs for registration and paging of the proposed scheme. The wired networks need to manage MS(Mobile Station) location for continuous service. For the location managements of MS, a number of cells are grouped to form a location area (LA). A MS's location is identified by the LA number it resides in. Since traffic loads on the wired networks are largely affected by LA sizes, how to assign the LA is important. User defined LA (UDLA) is a dynamic LA scheme that it defines variably LA according to routing of MS.	paging	Kwang-Youn Park;Sang-Jun Park;In-Sook Cho;Byunggi Kim	2002		10.1007/3-540-45801-8_23	telecommunications;computer science;operating system;mobile station;world wide web;computer network	Theory	-10.621200816703618	88.83797425727394	63050
b6e45bf73de99cec3c8e8bebc5adea3fe2c43f1b	service intelligent™ architecture		In the latter part of the last decade, we saw tremendous growth in the communications infrastructure at all levels of networking in the backbone. In particular, the deployed capacity in long-haul transport increased many fold as a result of unprecedented fiber deployment, the advent of DWDM with many tens of wavelengths per fiber, and increased bit rate per wavelength. We also saw deployment of cross connects with many hundred Gb/s to Tb/s capacity. These together allowed tremendous growth in the capacity to deliver high-speed private line services and in the trunking capacity between IP routers, ATM switches, and voice switches. The capacity of a single core router increased several fold to a few hundred Gb/s. The next phase of network evolution naturally involves deploying more capacity in access and creating new services that will use the end-to-end infrastructure capacity to enhance business productivity, add exciting entertainment, and assist in personal chores. Service innovations are key to fulfilling the promise of communication networks as the catalyst for fundamental changes in lifestyle.	atm turbo;core router;data rate units;end-to-end encryption;gigabyte;internet backbone;network switch;private line;router (computing);software deployment;telecommunications network;telephone exchange;terabyte;trunking;wavelength-division multiplexing	Bharat T.

In order to provide QoS for realtime traffic in IP network, Resource reSerVation Protocol (RSVP) is needed to reserve network resources along the route which the datagrams follow. However, current RSVP fails to operate through the MIP tunnel. Moreover, the high registration rate in a CMIP network greatly degrades RSVP performance. In this paper, an Indirect RSVP (IRSVP) over Virtual Cluster Cellular Mobile IP (VCCMIP) is proposed in which an assistant RSVP connection is introduced to assist the end-to-end major RSVP operation over the MIP tunnel. IRSVP signaling costs and packet loss rates are evaluated. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can greatly increase RSVP performance in terms of packet loss and RSVP connection active percentage.	internet protocol suite;mobile ip	Yu Zeng;Jon W.

Unlike their wired counterpart, mobile data networks are known to exhibit highly variable bandwidth. Moreover, base stations are often equipped with large buffers to absorb bandwidth fluctuations to prevent unnecessary packet losses. Consequently to optimize protocol performance in mobile data networks it is essential to be able to accurately characterize two key network properties: queue length and buffer size of the bottleneck link. This work tackles the challenge in estimating these two network properties in modern mobile data networks. Using extensive trace-driven simulations based on actual bandwidth trace data measured from production mobile data networks, we show that existing queue-length and link buffer size estimation algorithms no longer work well in bandwidth-varying networks. We develop a novel sum-of-delays algorithm which incorporates the effect of bandwidth variations into its estimation. Extensive trace-driven simulation results show that it can accurately estimate the queue length and link buffer size under both fixed and varying bandwidth conditions, outperforming existing algorithms by up to two orders of magnitude.	algorithm;bandwidth management;bottleneck (network);compaq lte;error detection and correction;internet;kernel density estimation;network congestion;network packet;quality of service;simulation;software deployment;streaming media;throughput	Stanley C.

Especially, we investigate the technical challenges in WMN VoIP systems and propose a design of an enhanced SIP proxy server to overcome them. An analysis of the signaling process and a study of simulation results have shown the advantages of our proposed approach.	display resolution;mesh networking;proxy server;server (computing);simulation;wireless mesh network	Bo Rong;Yi Qian;Hsiao-Hwa Chen	2008	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2008.4427238	wireless mesh network;telecommunications;computer science;signal processing;voice over ip;internet privacy;wi-fi array;world wide web;computer network	Mobile	-14.02203752094457	92.28731018576003	63683

In these applications, a 3D mesh is typically coded progressively, yielding a multiresolution representation suitable for streaming. While such progressive coding allows incremental rendering for users while data is being transmitted, it introduces dependencies between data, causing delay in rendering when packets are lost. This article quantitatively analyzes the effects of such dependency by modeling the distribution of decoding time as a function of mesh properties and network parameters. We apply our model to study two extreme cases of dependency in progressive meshes and show that the effect of dependencies on decoded mesh quality diminishes with time. Our model provides the expected decoded mesh quality at the receiver at a given time. Based on this expected value, we propose a packetization strategy that improves the decoded mesh quality during the initial stage of streaming. We validate the accuracy of our model under a variety of network conditions, including bursty losses, fluctuating RTT, and varying sending rate. The values predicted from our model match the measured value reasonably well in all cases except when losses are too bursty.	data dependency;incremental rendering;multiresolution analysis;progressive meshes;triangle mesh;triangulated irregular network;virtual world	Wei Cheng;Wei Tsang Ooi;Sebastien Mondet;Romulus Grigoras;Géraldine Morin	2011	TOMCCAP	10.1145/1925101.1925105	switched mesh;real-time computing;simulation;data type;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;triangle mesh;shared mesh;t-vertices;expected value;statistics;computer network	Visualization	-9.912476676183957	104.815961580454	63717
0de8d3d9ce5de571261d571c534a54010f53a6a6	on calibrating measurements of packet transit times	transit time;network time protocol;wide area network	We discuss the problem of detecting errors in measurements of the total delay experienced by packets transmitted through a wide-area network. We assume that we have measurements of the transmission times of a group of packets sent from an originating host, A, and a corresponding set of measurements of their arrival times at their destination host, B, recorded by two separate clocks. We also assume that we have a similar series of measurements of packets sent from B to A (as might occur when recording a TCP connection), but we do not assume that the clock at A is synchronized with the clock at B, nor that they run at the same frequency. We develop robust algorithms for detecting abrupt adjustments to either clock, and for estimating the relative skew between the clocks. By analyzing a large set of measurements of Internet TCP connections, we find that both clock adjustments and relative skew are sufficiently common that failing to detect them can lead to potentially large errors when analyzing packet transit times. We further find that synchronizing clocks using a network time protocol such as NTP does not free them from such errors.	algorithm;failure;heuristic;host (network);michael luby;network packet;sally floyd;sensor;synchro;synchronizing word;writing commons	Vern Paxson	1998		10.1145/277851.277865	clock synchronization;embedded system;real-time computing;network time protocol;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Metrics	-5.230883658502224	90.60370229792927	63880

In order to reach that, it is very critical for network to identify each video frame and to know the decoding priorities for each video frame. In this paper, a new Cross-layer Design technique, Deep Packet Inspection(DPI) technique, is proposed to deal with this question, which penetrates into linker layer, network layer, transport layer, and closely exams the video stream and marks the video sequence information, video GOP information, video frame type and many other parameters. The simulation test also proved the availability of this technique.	deep packet inspection;network packet;simulation;streaming media	Hai-qing Du;Chun-hua Tan;Jun-xiang Gao	2009	2009 WRI World Congress on Computer Science and Information Engineering	10.1109/CSIE.2009.701	video compression picture types;reference frame;inter frame;frame;deep packet inspection;real-time computing;uncompressed video;telecommunications;computer science;video tracking;block-matching algorithm;video processing;smacker video;motion compensation;computer network;multiview video coding	Networks	-6.489092113110607	100.9428513452247	63942

In this work, we discuss the integration of complementary wireless techniques to construct a personal moving network. The personal wireless devices ( smartphones, camcorders, and netbooks) and even medical monitoring sensors are interconnected with a wide-area backbone through a local multi-mode gateway. The mobile nodes in a personal moving network move in group and are provided seamless connectivity through a backhaul relay channel from the local gateway toward the backbone network. In some specific scenarios, the local gateway can be as simple as a multi-radio smartphone. In this study, we investigate the construction and resource allocation for a personal moving network. Aggregate multi-service traffic of interactive data, conversational video, and electrocardiography (ECG) monitoring are considered in the resource allocation. We develop a stochastic Petri net to model the access selection scheme, which is logically clear and easy to follow. The flow-level performance is evaluated in terms of new connection blocking probability and handoff dropping probability. We further analyze the packet-level performance of the heterogeneous two-hop network. Considering the urgency of medical services, a non-preemptive priority policy is applied to mitigate the impact of background traffic and prioritize the transmission of ECG data.	aggregate function;hop	Shan Yang;Wei Song;Zhangdui Zhong	2013	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-012-0570-1	wireless wan;heterogeneous network;telecommunications;resource allocation;wireless network;municipal wireless network;wi-fi array;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-11.149275538965705	94.9894822805608	63944

Due to their advantages compared to traditional techniques, HAS-based protocols are widely used for over-the-top (OTT) video streaming. However, they are yet to be adopted in managed environments, such as ISP networks. A major obstacle is the purely client-driven design of current HAS approaches, which leads to excessive quality oscillations, suboptimal behavior, and the inability to enforce management policies. Moreover, the provider has no control over the quality that is provided, which is essential when offering a managed service. This article tackles these challenges and facilitates the adoption of HAS in managed networks. Specifically, several centralized and distributed algorithms and heuristics are proposed that allow nodes inside the network to steer the HAS client's quality selection process. The algorithms are able to enforce management policies by limiting the set of available qualities for specific clients. Additionally, simulation results show that by coordinating the quality selection process across multiple clients, the proposed algorithms significantly reduce quality oscillations by a factor of five and increase the average delivered video quality by at least 14%.	centralized computing;client (computing);distributed algorithm;heuristic (computer science);hypertext transfer protocol;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;network switch;noise shaping;over-the-top content;server (computing);simulation;streaming media;traffic shaping	Niels Bouten;Steven Latré;Jeroen Famaey;Werner Van Leekwijck;Filip De Turck	2014	IEEE Transactions on Multimedia	10.1109/TMM.2014.2362856	real time streaming protocol;real-time computing;integer programming;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;adaptive system;multimedia;world wide web;computer network	Metrics	-7.895433410765262	98.59520869248315	64216

In this approach, a new network element called VoIP mobile switching center (VMSC) is introduced to replace standard GSM MSC. Both standard GSM and GPRS mobile stations can be used to receive real-time VoIP service, which need not be equipped with the VoIP (i.e., H.323) terminal capabilities. The vGPRS approach is implemented using standard H.323, GPRS, and GSM protocols. Thus, existing GPRS and H.323 network elements are not modified. Furthermore, the message flows for vGPRS registration, call origination, call release and call termination procedures are described to show the feasibility of our vGPRS system.

Users now have greatly increased responsibilities for the selection, care, and operation of facilities and equipment on their own premises, and for the selection of and interconnection with carrier-supplied services. Network management at the corporate level has become a complex exercise in economic decision-making, constrained to minimize overall network costs at given levels of service quality and quantity. Telecommunications premises networks comprise various components, including stations or terminals, e.g., telephone sets and data terminals; telephone key systems (small-group telephone systems used in small offices or as part of a larger system); private branch exchange (PBX) switching systems; multiplexers; wire, radio, IR, and fiber optic links; and local area networks (LAN). A premises network could consist of entirely owned equipment, or leased equipment, or a combination of the two (e.g., owned telephones and leased local switching services from a telephone company's local central office). This paper describes a model to evaluate costs of alternative premises network configurations, taking into account acquisition and operational costs. An interactive user interface accepts entries of network component, quantity, and cost parameters. The model provides a forecast of events and costs, both capital and expense, for each component in the network and for the network as a whole.

We measure the overall failure rate between 5% and 18%, depending on the MTU of the constraining link. We explore methods webserver operators are using to reduce their dependence on PMTUD, and find 11% limit themselves to sending packets no larger than 1380 bytes. We identify a number of common behaviours that seem to be software bugs rather than filtering by firewalls. If these are corrected PMTUD failures could be reduced by 63%.

The test broadcasting uses MPEG media transport (MMT) as an internet-protocol-based multiplexing scheme to realize advanced hybrid services by using the Internet. The utilization of hybrid services is one of the most important requirements for next-generation terrestrial broadcasting. This is especially true for mobile reception because the mobility of the user changes the receiving condition, and a receiver may move into an area shielded from broadcast radio. In this paper, we implement and evaluate a hybrid video delivery system using MMT-based terrestrial broadcasting and a long-term evolution cellular network to maintain user experience.	mpeg media transport;moving picture experts group;multiplexing;radio broadcasting;requirement;terrestrial television;user experience	Yuki Kawamura;Kazuhiro Otsuki	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics (ICCE)	10.1109/ICCE.2018.8326084	electronic engineering;the internet;field experiment;radio broadcasting;computer science;user experience design;computer network;cellular network;multiplexing;broadcasting	Mobile	-17.275338625205887	94.41986946490687	64474

Studies of application-level traffic analysis have been performed as the first step of the management and control of network traffic. Many studies have been utilizing “User-Agent” field in the HTTP header in order to analyze application-level HTTP traffic. As a result, most of HTTP-based applications can be classified with user-agent information, but some of HTTP traffic cannot be analyzed since it does not include user-agent field. In this paper, we use server-client correlation of HTTP service in order to improve completeness of HTTP analysis. Therefore, even though user-agent field does not exist in the HTTP header, analysis of application-level can be accomplished. We show our method feasibility through the experiment in a campus network.	http cookie;hypertext transfer protocol;list of http header fields;network traffic control;server (computing);traffic analysis;user agent	Hwan-Hee Kim;Mi-Jung Choi	2013	2013 International Conference on ICT Convergence (ICTC)	10.1109/ICTC.2013.6675538	traffic generation model;traffic policing;network planning and design;network traffic control;traffic classification;floating car data;network management station;computer science;network management application;internet privacy;traffic shaping;world wide web;network monitoring;internet traffic engineering;computer network;network traffic simulation	Mobile	-10.695099981942896	97.23816244335434	64993

e6c9ae81adf3241137fa5b2d165337bd61bccde5	client-side solution for qos measurement of video content delivery over ip networks		The number of IP Digital TeleVision (DTV) services has been growing rapidly in last decade. In order to provide the high quality video content to the end users, it is necessary to measure and monitor the Quality of Service (QoS) for mentioned services. In this paper the problem of QoS measurement in IP DTV services, from the client standpoint, is explored. As a solution, a computer application for measurement of QoS parameters through analysis of data provided by network protocols, is proposed. Communication protocols, which are a part of the IP DTV services standard, are presented. Metrics provided by the measurement application and methods of their extraction through protocol analysis are defined. Multiple existing software solutions for network QoS measurement are evaluated. The most suitable solution is integrated into the measurement application. Measurement accuracy is tested by comparing the measurement results with results provided by the reference analysis software (Wireshark). Results obtained by the implemented application are competitive to these obtained by the reference analysis software.

The goal of developing and standardizing RTCWeb for real-time communication is to enhance the communication experience over the Internet. The RTCWeb protocol stack provides a service for several use cases, which includes media as well as non-media data transfer. Therefore, it adapts some established protocols like SCTP for a new common goal. Since real-time communication comes with the inherent need for low end-to-end delay, this article will discuss possible enhancements to SCTP that will improve the RTCWeb service in that regard.	end-to-end encryption;internet;protocol stack;real-time clock;real-time transcription	Martin Becke;Erwin P.

This mechanism contains an effective buffering method, an intelligent filtering and QoS negotiation method, and a playout control method to provide seamless playback of multimedia streams. To implement the mechanisms in the mobile computing environment, we take the concept of proxy. It is located in the intermediate place between two communication endpoints and it pluys the role of an agent of the mobile hosts. The proq' uses the buffering method to keep constant transmission rates using feedback so that it can provide an aduptive stream service to the network. I f needed, the proxy may transform the streams by applying filters to make mobile hosts' environments more optimal. And it does QoS negotiation with mobile hosts if the network bandwidth cannot support required QoS or i f the environment of mobile host was changed.	mobile computing;playout;proxy server;quality of service;seamless3d	Dong-Hoon Nam;Seung-Kyu Park	2001		10.1109/ICOIN.2001.905442	real-time computing;mobile qos;quality of service;computer science;software agent;operating system;feedback;distributed computing;mobile computing;computer network;data transmission	Mobile	-7.408835459678183	96.67077644340833	65501

Unfortunately, network resources, such as routers, do not yet fully support RSVP reservation protocols so that guarantees cannot truly be given. In this paper , we suggest to follow the paradigm of open programmable networks for a more complete QoS provisioning. Reservation gaps or tunnels are dynamically closed by means of a software-agent approach that is exibly deployed for an application oriented QoS support.

Multipath TCP (MPTCP) is the transport protocol recommended by IETF to enable concurrent data transmissions over multiple communication paths. However, it still remains problematic to deliver user-satisfied video services with the existing MPTCP schemes due to the contradiction between mobile device energy and video distortion. To enable the energy-efficient and quality-guaranteed video streaming, this paper presents an Energy-Distortion Aware MPTCP (EDAM) solution. First, we develop an analytical model to capture the energy-distortion tradeoff for multipath video transmission over heterogeneous wireless networks. Second, we propose a video flow rate allocation algorithm to minimize the energy consumption while achieving target video quality based on utility maximization theory. The performance of the proposed EDAM is evaluated through extensive emulations in Exata involving real-time H.264 video streaming. Evaluation results demonstrate that EDAM outperforms the reference MPTCP schemes in reducing energy consumption, as well as in improving video PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio).	access network;distortion;energy minimization;expectation–maximization algorithm;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;internet protocol suite;mobile device;multipath propagation;peak signal-to-noise ratio;real-time clock;streaming media	Jiyan Wu;Bo Cheng;Ming Wang	2016	2016 IEEE 36th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)	10.1109/ICDCS.2016.25	real-time computing;distortion;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;efficient energy use;computer network	Mobile	-6.295775494562176	101.12022412119634	65662

Since there are heterogeneous receivers and changing network conditions, it has been proposed to use adaptive rate control techniques such as layered video multicast to adjust the video traffic according to the available Internet resources. A problem of layered video multicast is unable to provide fair bandwidth sharing between competing video sessions. We propose two schemes, layered video multicast with congestion sensitivity and adaptive join-timer (LVMCA) and layered video multicast with priority dropping (LVMPD), to achieve inter-session fairness for layered video multicast. Receiver driven layered multicast (RLM), layer-based congestion sensitivity, LVMCA, and LVMPD are simulated and compared. The results show that both schemes, especially LVMPD, are fairer and have shorter convergence time than other two schemes.	fairness measure;multicast	Wei Kuang Lai;Chieh Ying Pan	2001		10.1109/ICC.2001.937375	real-time computing;multicast;the internet;ip multicast;inter-domain;reliable multicast;adaptive control;mbone;protocol independent multicast;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;internet group management protocol;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;xcast;visual communication;computer network;multicast address	Networks	-4.562576482764113	95.78090742498941	65713

542f02abccf36009a541800f19574bb2570f1871	performance analysis of quic protocol in integrated satellites and terrestrial networks		In consideration of future significant number of network satellites orbiting in various heights and trajectories, there is a new trend that network protocols designed for current satellites might give way to protocols that dominate terrestrial networks for better adaption in scale as well as integration of future Internet. QUIC, a novel and experimental transport layer protocol, implemented by Google and designed for a quicker HTTP service has proved itself in the market and QUIC outperformed TCP most in environment with a long latency and high packet loss, which is the main feature in space. However, there is a lack of research that studies QUIC’s performance in space networks. This paper focuses on QUIC’s performance in space-terrestrial integrated networks compared with TCP and its modification. For this purpose, we design a concise space network with both LEO and GEO satellites involved, covering different kinds of transmission scenarios. Simulation of the network is divided into several parts, decision of different satellites’ orbit parameters, real-time visibility data calculated through Satellite Tool Kit(STK), communication modeling in MATLAB and finally network conditions converted. Related data were then input in a real testbed for transport performance comparison among QUIC, TCP(Cubic Reno) and TCP with ECN enabled. The semi-physical experiment demonstrates that QUIC outperforms TCP in all experiment cases through the analysis of page load time (PLT), which shows the potential that network issues in space settled with terrestrial solutions.	communications protocol;experiment;explicit congestion notification;future internet;handshaking;hypertext transfer protocol;loader (computing);matlab;network packet;profiling (computer programming);racket;real-time clock;stk;semiconductor industry;simulation;terrestrial television;testbed	Siyu Yang;Hewu Li;Qian Wu	2018	2018 14th International Wireless Communications & Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2018.8450388	quic;computer network;latency (engineering);the internet;distributed computing;communications protocol;packet loss;transport layer;testbed;computer science;space network	Metrics	-6.126711968753181	92.86082180036956	66189
7fe899541d8fae66ebbe307862388734a70fc1cd	on the performance boost for peer to peer webrtc-based video streaming with network coding		Video on Demand (VoD) streaming makes up an increasing portion of global IP traffic. Traditionally, data is served by content providers directly, putting a huge network load on the servers. We propose using our WebRTC-based protocols WebPeer and CodedWebPeer to create a P2P-assisted VoD streaming system with network coding. We introduce two metrics: network health to measure overall data saturation and network stability to show if the peers in the network are able to serve each other without the help of the server. We have implemented a testbed to emulate real-life network scenarios that includes a probabilistic model of peer behavior. We show through measurements that by applying network coding, network health is increased by up to 100% without changing the cache size or number of peers. Furthermore, network stability is achieved using up to half the cache compared to the uncoded approach, without increasing the servers load. Finally, to validate the scalability of our solution, we tested our protocols in a network with more than 100 tablets to deliver smooth video playback.	linear network coding;mathematical model;peer-to-peer;real life;scalability;server (computing);statistical model;streaming media;tablet computer;testbed;webrtc	Patrik J.

We divide bridging solutions into two categories: hardware solutions and middleware solutions. Hardware solutions have both low power short distance wireless interfaces and other types of transmission interfaces, e.g. GPRS, 3G/4G, via hardware implementations. This kind of solutions is more stable and more applicable for deployed sensor networks. In middleware solutions, the whole system processes appropriate protocol conversion. This kind of solutions is more independent of hardware, making it easier to be reused in different networks. This paper briefly presents key points of each solution and evaluates advantages and disadvantages of them in terms of different criteria. Eventually, we derive the most appropriate situation for each solution from our comparisons and discussions.	bluetooth;bridging (networking);computer hardware;enterprise application integration;internet of things;middleware;ork;smartphone	Wenlong Yue;Yuanyuan Zhang;Zhenquan Qin;Ming Zhu;Cheng Jin;Lei Wang;Lei Shu;Canfeng Chen	2013	2013 IEEE 9th International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks	10.1109/MSN.2013.98	embedded system;communications protocol;wireless sensor network;6lowpan;logic gate;computer science;operating system;middleware;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;internet of things;computer network	Mobile	-17.811974810759878	89.64644315535249	66685

The analysis also proposes variations in the modelling of traffic distributions regarding the number of multiplexed users.

This paper describes an improved equation based rate adaptation (EBRA) scheme for video streaming over universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS). In our method, transmission rate is determined as a function of packet size (s), round trip time (rtt), loss event rate (p) and two novel control parameters for congestion window adjustment (α and β). Our mechanism is compatible with unpredictable wireless channel conditions and provides smooth and flexible sending rate and slowly responsible congestion control by dynamic modification of mentioned parameters. We have simulated this method in UMTS and our results indicate that EBRA in addition to network stability increases throughput with low variations.	fairness measure;network congestion;network packet;quality of service;quantum fluctuation;requirement;streaming media;tcp congestion control;throughput;time of arrival;window function	Abdolkarim Mardanian Dehkordi;Vahid Tabataba Vakili	2013	Telecommunication Systems	10.1007/s11235-011-9668-0	cellular network;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;tfrc;umts frequency bands;computer network	Mobile	-6.201304687432511	98.41610399536651	66924
c6b68a74afdbf46801022fc4204b7e2d64b24b39	measuring and adapting mqtt in cellular networks for collaborative smart farming		In distributed Smart Farming applications, a reliable communication is often crucial, in particular during collaborating operations. In rural areas, the network connectivity via Public Land Mobile Networks is, however, not always sufficient. Network disruptions may occur hindering reliable transmissions. For the delivery of periodic sensor data streams of agricultural machines, several modern communication frameworks adopt the Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT). Although MQTT is built on top of TCP, a reliable delivery, even of important data, cannot generally be guaranteed in rural environments. Due to handovers and spatial dead zones, this is in particular the case when clients are mobile.,,,,This paper presents a case-study-based performance evaluation of MQTT regarding a reliable data transmission in real-world scenarios with mobile clients. Therefore, we investigate both links, publisher to broker and broker to subscriber, separately. By doing so, we show that both links significantly benefit from a suitable parameterization of MQTT. Moreover, for many data streams in the considered scenario, the default FIFO queuing strategy of MQTT is not always the most suitable approach to cope with network disruptions. Hence, we implemented LIFO queuing as well as a novel hybrid approach in MQTT as a proof-of-concept and evaluated its impact.	alternating turing machine;emulator;fifo (computing and electronics);fair queuing;mqtt;message queue;performance evaluation;reliable messaging	Jan Bauer;Nils Aschenbruck	2017	2017 IEEE 42nd Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN)	10.1109/LCN.2017.81	message queue;computer network;fifo and lifo accounting;fifo (computing and electronics);quality of service;data stream mining;mqtt;mobile computing;computer science;distributed computing;cellular network	Mobile	-5.857408806641252	91.58569645894676	67029

It particularly focuses on using a programmable network to offer a new type of wholesale product by adding value to the wholesale of pure carriage. By augmenting the wholesale of carriage with the wholesale of network-based computation, the need for server overlay deployment to support retail service providers is reduced or eliminated. The paper develops an efficient algorithm for allocation and management of computation and transport resources within the network infrastructure. This algorithm is designed to optimize a large network supporting many retail service providers and can be used by the wholesaler for the optimal management of scarce computational and transport resources. The algorithm is based on the Lagrangian relaxation method and provides error bounds so that the accuracy of the solution can be ascertained. Numerical results are presented and the benefit of the optimization for a simple multi-service scenario is assessed.	algorithm;computation;lagrangian relaxation;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;numerical method;overlay network;relaxation (approximation);server (computing);software deployment	Farzad Safaei;Iradj Ouveysi;Moshe Zukerman;Rob Pattie	2001	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/49.917715	service provider;active networking;simulation;index term;lagrangian relaxation;computer science;computer network	Networks	-7.660910003367687	88.79552937958705	67404

A solution using P2P has been also proposed, but a structure for safe content exchange guaranteed by the service provider is necessary for the further spread of a service. Therefore, we propose a distributed storage video on demand system (DSVS) for delivering CGV content stored in a user IP storage. It is important to know how the server in a network manages stored CGV(s), including the storage. A standard system for managing the storage and also the stored files does not exist. Thus, we propose a storage management system, a part of our DSVS, that uses a session initiation protocol presence function and an XML database management system. These are additional functions of the IP multimedia subsystem, which is a core system of the next generation network (NGN). In Japan, access services for the IPv6 Internet and an NGN with one IPv6 address began in 2011. Therefore, the number of potential NGN users will increase with the spread of the IPv6 Internet access service. We show that our system can become the foundation of various content delivery services due to the versatility of the storage management capability of our DSVS.	application programming interface;carrier grade;clustered file system;digital distribution;digital video;file server;hierarchical storage management;ip multimedia subsystem;information management system (ims);internet access;multicast;next-generation network;peer-to-peer;scalability;server (computing);sockets direct protocol;xml database	Yoshihiro Nomoto;Tomonori Kuzukawa;Yutaka Ishibashi	2011	2011 Australasian Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference (ATNAC)	10.1109/ATNAC.2011.6096631	computer science;database;world wide web;computer network	DB	-18.94265211676801	90.67917166749298	67769

Whereas for services like email the best-effort nature of the Internet can be considered sufficient, other services strongly depend on service-specific connection quality parameters. This quality dependence has led to dedicated content distribution networks as a workaround solution for services like YouTube. Such workarounds are applicable to a small number of services only. With the global application of the Internet, the impact of quality of service varies from annoyance due to jitter in VoIP communication to endangering human lives in telemedicine applications. Thus network connections with end-to-end quality guarantees are indispensable for various existing and evolving services. In this paper we consider point-to-point multi-domain network connections for which the end-to-end quality has to be assured. Our contribution includes the classification of fault cases in general and countermeasures against end-to-end performance degradation. By correlating events and reasonable countermeasures, this work provides the foundation for quality assurance during the operation phase of end-to-end connections. We put our contribution in the context of a vision of global-goal-aware self-adaptation in computer networks and outline further research areas that require a similar classification to the work provided here.

Many researches of QoE have been reported where subjective analysis, e.g. in the form of Mean Opinion Score (MOS), for audio/video applications and data services are performed. These studies mainly focus on how users feel while using such applications. In this paper, we focus on how users behave and react to communication network quality. We analyze the telecom traffic of smartphones passively monitored from 3G mobile network and show the effect of network quality on the users' web behavior. In particular, we investigate user behavior as a series of multiple actions in a flow of web browsing. We show that the observed results coincide with the MOS obtained through subjective analysis: The condition of network quality where the users' web behavior changes matches with the condition where the MOS starts to degrade. In addition, the obtained results illustrate that the users perform various reactive actions depending on the perceived network quality. Specifically, users generate more web traffic and transactions when the qualities of the network are both good and poor.	download;hypertext transfer protocol;network congestion;smartphone;telecommunications network;throughput;web traffic	Hideyuki Koto;Norihiro Fukumoto;Sumaru Niida;Hidetoshi Yokota;Shin'ichi Arakawa;Masayuki Murata	2014	2014 26th International Teletraffic Congress (ITC)	10.1109/ITC.2014.6932954	embedded system;throughput;mobile search;mobile web;quality of service;computer science;engineering;operating system;internet privacy;mobile computing;world wide web;correlation;computer network	Metrics	-10.248215661833163	98.10538535973119	67811

Producing simulators/trainers capable of a large volume of highfidelity sensory feedback under current processing constraints is a significant challenge to the simulation developer. Level of Detail (LOD) switching is a visualization technique available to simulation designers for increasing frame rendition rates without sacrificing scene quality. This paper examines the use of several criteria to build upon existing LOD techniques to develop a holistic approach to LOD switching for visual simulations of high-risk environments. It investigates both the types of model changes that are acceptable in situations as well as the thresholds of the user’s preattentive perception.

During this time no packets are received and, if not addressed, these dropped packets cause unacceptable interruptions in the audio stream. A long dropout of this kind may be overcome by ensuring that the buffer at the client is large enough. However, when using fixed bit rate technologies this may only be done by buffering packets for an extended period before starting to play the track. During this period, many users are likely to lose interest or become frustrated. This paper presents a novel semantic audio error concealment algorithm which enables the audio to start playing within two or three seconds, while at the same time using a small proportion of the available bandwidth to fill the client device buffer with received packets but categorised into structures of the song. A pattern matching runtime algorithm works to identify portions of the audio stream and when a dropout does occur the relevant sections of the buffered audio are inserted so as to create a perfect match for the lost audio. Our algorithm can be shown to increase reliability on bursty wireless networks.	algorithm;dropout (neural networks);error concealment;network packet;pattern matching;streaming media	Kevin Curran	2003		10.1109/ITCC.2003.1197616	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Networks	-6.574530368572067	99.55829896554653	67903

This paper proposes a new distributed mobility scheme in the HIMALIS architecture for supporting seamless mobility for the host moving across access networks of different network-layer protocols. The proposed scheme also supports mobility of an access network. It includes a signaling procedure to redirect downstream traffic from the previous gateway (or previous access router) to the new gateway (or new access router) to minimize the service disruption or packet losses during a handover. The performance results obtained from a testbed implementation in Linux validate the effectiveness of the proposal. The results demonstrate that it can achieve seamless (no packet loss) handovers if overlapped wireless access networks are available.	access network;denial-of-service attack;downstream (software development);experiment;linux;lossless compression;modified huffman coding;network packet;online locator service;proxy mobile ipv6;router (computing);seamless3d;smoothing;testbed;wireless access point	Ved P.

Different solutions for providing adaptive video streaming exist in the literature, and one of them is Scalable Video Coding (SVC). A video segment is divided into one base layer and multiple enhancement layers in SVC. Effective buffering at the client and its state is another critical factor for improved viewing quality of the video, which is rarely considered. Timely information regarding client’s buffer state and current network condition is a vital role to adapt with the number of layers in SVC appropriately. Network softwarization through Software Defined Networking (SDN) provides an opportunity to manage and control video streams with better resource management. This paper improves AVS in SDN enabled network through combined measurement of current network bandwidth and client’s buffer state. At the SDN controller, the proposed solution estimates the remaining buffer time and collects the current bandwidth condition of the network to determine the number of enhancement layers for a video segment. SVC video server is extended to transmit a video segment based on the number of enhancement layers decided by the SDN controller. The emulation-based performance evaluation shows that the proposed solution not only improves the video quality against conventional approach under low to moderate network utilization, but also increases the network utilization.	software-defined networking	Joonbeom Ahn;Syed M.

In this paper, we propose a cognitive passive estimation of the available bandwidth (cPEAB) by correct measurements of i) the proportion of waiting and back-off delay, ii) packet collision probability, iii) acknowledgement delay, and iv) channel idle time compared to measurement period. For more accurate estimation of the available bandwidth, the information of the hidden nodes and exposed nodes are provided by the cognitive network management system. Also, the proposed scheme is using passive measurements, instead of active probe packet exchange which directly affects the available bandwidth of other mobile nodes. The proposed cPEAB scheme has been implemented on Multiband Atheros Driver for WiFi (MadWiFi), and the performance has been analyzed and compared with existing schemes, such as active bandwidth measurements with probes, adaptive admission control protocol (AAC), available bandwidth estimation (ABE), and improved available bandwidth estimation (IAB). From the experimental measurements on real WiFi environment, we found that the proposed cPEAB provides the most accurate estimation of available bandwidth on the overlapped WiFi WLAN environment where the hidden/exposed nodes are dynamically affecting the available bandwidth.	advanced audio coding;backoff;cognition;cognitive network;collision domain;future internet;international federation for information processing;internet architecture board;network packet;open-source software;provisioning;quality of service;seamless3d	Shahnaza Tursunova;Khamidulla Inoyatov;Young-Tak Kim	2010	2010 IEEE Network Operations and Management Symposium - NOMS 2010	10.1109/NOMS.2010.5488496	estimation;cognitive radio;real-time computing;the internet;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;mathematical model;network monitoring;bandwidth;dynamic bandwidth allocation;time;computer network	Metrics	-9.972730810858677	91.44516950775427	68205

However, the majority of the work concerning protection schemes considered the primary connections as equally important when contending for the use of the backup resources. As a first contribution we therefore propose an improvement of the existing shared protection schemes through the introduction of relative priorities among the different primary connections contending for the access to the protection path. Moreover, as a second contribution, we propose to include a novel service differentiation parameter, the service disruption rate of a connection, to provide differentiated services in a WDM mesh network, and we motivate the use of such a parameter with numerical examples. As a third contribution, we present a mathematical model for both the classical protection schemes and for the proposed priority-aware scheme. As a key distinguishing feature from existing literature we derive explicit analytic expressions for the average availability and service disruption rate resulting from the deployment of such schemes. By solving these models we then evaluate numerically the benefits of the service differentiation feature introduced in our scheme as well as the impact of the service disruption rate as service differentiator.	backup;denial-of-service attack;differentiated service;differentiated services;differentiator;mathematical model;mesh networking;numerical analysis;path protection;quality of service;software deployment;wavelength-division multiplexing	Wissam Fawaz;Fabio Martignon;Ken Chen;Guy Pujolle	2005	IEEE International Conference on Communications, 2005.

To predict QoE, it is sufficient to predict the PSNR time series. The possibility of predicting QoE further enables QoE-based network resource allocation. We propose two approaches to packet-based prediction of PSNR time series to overcome the limitations of frame-based approaches. The proposed first approach adopts a parametric model for the impact on the video quality due to losing a packet, while the second proposed approach is parameter-free. Simulation results show that both approaches significantly outperform the simple mean or median algorithms and are close to their respective performance bounds.	approximation algorithm;network packet;parametric model;peak signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;time series	Liangping Ma;Gregory Sternberg	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)	10.1109/ICME.2015.7177509	real-time computing;simulation;prediction;computer science;time series;multimedia;statistics	HPC	-6.104246867045344	100.30283491638546	68288

The next generation mobile/cellular systems are being designed to operate on a core IP (Internet Protocol) network, supporting all the popular operating systems and software applications. They are expected to support mobile rates of 100 Mbps, and fixed rates of 1Gbps. Also, the mobile phones have been transformed from mere voice communication devices to advanced communication devices (voice, text and video messaging). In addition, they have acquired features of consumer electronics (with built-in cameras, MP3 players, video capture and play), and computing (email, Web access, spread sheets). The emerging and future mobile systems facilitate the provision of rich multimedia content services, such as TV broadcasts, video streaming, music, video telephony, multimedia messaging, Web browsing, mobile commerce, and (multi-party) games, mobile collaboration, and several location-based services. The worldwide mobile content market is expected reach $59 Billion by 2009, according to Juniper Research. The development and deployment of content, applications, and services have been transforming from being technology-centric to being content-centric and user-centric. The ultimate objective of mobile content and services is to provide the users with a rich experience in a convenient and cost-effective manner, and to provide the mobile vendors, operators, and service providers with appropriate ROI (return on investment).	built-in self-test;data rate units;email;gigabit;internet access;location-based service;mp3;mobile commerce;mobile phone;next-generation network;operating system;region of interest;software deployment;streaming media;videotelephony	S.

On the other hand, it is possible to establish multiple paths between a source and a destination, which provides an extra degree of freedom in designing video coding and transport schemes. In this paper, we review several video encoding and transport control techniques, all assuming that a routing protocol is able to set up and constantly update two paths each made of multiple links. The techniques that we have examined include i) layered coding and selective Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ), ii) reference picture selection, and iii) multiple description coding. Depending on the availability of a feedback channel, the delay constraint, and the error characteristics of the established paths, one technique is better suited than another. These techniques are also applicable to other networks such as the Internet where it is possible to set up multiple paths.	automatic repeat request;cognitive dimensions of notations;data compression;hoc (programming language);internet;multiple description coding;routing	Shunan Lin;Yao Wang;Shiwen Mao;Shivendra S.

bf37b65ae8bbba28e8424e2ddf591d3cc3b5c56f	strip-based multi-view image compression for visual sensor networks		Today P2P faces two important challenges: design of mechanisms to encourage users’ collaboration in multimedia live streaming services; design of reliable algorithms with QoS provision, to encourage multimedia providers employ the P2P topology in commercial streaming services. We believe that these two challenges are tightly-related and there is much to be done with respect. This paper proposes a novel monetary incentive for P2P multimedia streaming. The incentive model classifies the users in groups according to the perceived video quality. We apply the model to a streaming system’s billing model in order to evaluate its feasibility and visualize its quantitative effect on the users’ motivation and the provider’s profit. We conclude that monetary incentive can boost up users’ cooperation, loyalty and enhance the overall system integrity and performance. Moreover the model defines the constraints for the provider’s cost and profit when the system is leveraged on the cloud. Considering those constraints, a multimedia content provider can adapt the billing model of his streaming service and achieve desirable discount-profit trade-off. This will moreover contribute to better promotion of the service, across the users on the Internet.	algorithm;cloud computing;electronic billing;image compression;internet;peer-to-peer;quality of service;streaming media;system integrity;video	Nguyen Ho Minh Quang;Wai Chong Chia;Kah Phooi Seng;Li MinnAng	2012	JMPT		wireless sensor network;real-time computing;visual processing;image compression;energy consumption;workstation;data transmission;computer science;electronic engineering;set partitioning in hierarchical trees	Metrics	-9.54928132381399	99.30319501728411	68569

On the other hand, TUTMAC has been fully implemented in SDL. The formal system designs are simulated for verifying the required functionality. By simulations, the architectural operability of the transport service system design has been tested, e.g. with a very high number of users and with different telecommunication network environments. For the embedded TUTMAC protocol, real-time simulations are performed for evaluating the performance and capacity requirements of the application for the final platform.	access control;embedded system;formal system;operability;real-time clock;requirement;simulation;specification and description language;systems design;telecommunications network;verification and validation	Antti Laitinen;Marko Hännikäinen;Timo Hämäläinen	2002		10.1109/ISCAS.2002.1010629	embedded system;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;telecommunications service;operating system;service-oriented architecture;simulation modeling;public transport;computer network;systems design	Embedded	-17.775705830294235	92.0700789254478	68694

However, the practical implementation of 4G network to demonstrate such potential, especially for delivering real-time and highquality video services, is scarce. This paper therefore provides the design and implementation of a future Internet live TV system over 4G networks to achieve cost-effectiveness, instead of using expensive satellite news gathering (SNG) vehicle and costly satellite transmissions in traditional TV stations. To effectively provide live TV services, we apply not only the hybrid duplex modes but also the portbased VLAN on the deployed networks for maximizing bandwidth, minimizing signal interference, and guaranteeing QoS of differentiated services.

Therefore, these ISPs must provide quality of service support to these applications consistent with that offered by the backbone. However, this is a very challenging task in the wireless environment due to the instability of the wireless channel and the diverse quality of service requirements dictated by different multimedia applications. In this paper we introduce a resource allocation algorithm for the wireless link that distributes information from the ISP facility to the homes.

Understanding how the players’ actions affect the network parameters, the game platform, and the overall perceived quality is highly relevant for the purposes of game design, as well as for the networking infrastructure and network support for games. We break player actions down into discrete categories, and show that each category is distinct in terms of several key metrics. We discuss which categories of actions could be supported on current mobile devices, and present evidence in form of a user survey demonstrating the demand for such services. The starting points into the discussion include the networking, session and latency requirements for particular player actions on one side, and the players’ interest on the other.

This study contributes not only to the systematic generalization of the theory but also to the examination of the waste of resource innate in the flat rate tariff. We found that the superiority between the two charging systems with regard to the waste of resource is not decided by the generic features of the charging systems themselves but by the scarcity of network resource. In other words, the flat rate pricing is better when there is no limit in the supportable volume of network source. Otherwise, the usage-based pricing system is better in the respect of reducing the unnecessary waste of network resource.	elasticity (cloud computing);flat rate;internet access	Jee-hyung Lee;Jeong-Seok Park	2003		10.1007/3-540-45036-X_16	pricing;the internet;artificial intelligence;social welfare;computer security	ECom	-15.900262441499073	100.25374648560816	70557
fc0942b534a3cc09d5ab3569137ed56e900d3c54	unequal error protection for video streaming using delay-aware fountain codes		Recently, the forward error correction (FEC) codes are gaining popularity in video transmission community because of its capability of recovering lost packets in lossy wireless networks. The state-of-the-art scheme for FEC video transmission are the delay-aware fountain codes (DAF), which combine the ratelessness of fountain codes with the property of video coding. However, DAF assumes that all the data in the video has the same importance, thus every packet should have the equal chance to be decoded. In this work, in order to further adapt DAF to real-world video coding, we propose a method to integrate the unequal error protection (UEP) into DAF to provide additional protection for important bits. Different from the existing schemes, the proposed scheme does not impose any restriction on the importance profile, and it does not rely on any specific video coding standard. Most importantly, the proposed scheme is designed within the framework of DAF, so it neither requires any change on the DAF decoder or the protocol, nor any additional coordination between encoder and decoder. Simulation experiments show the proposed system achieves higher decoding ratios and PSNR compared to equal error protection (EEP) under the same network conditions.	algorithm;data compression;delayed auditory feedback;encoder;error detection and correction;experiment;forward error correction;fountain code;lossy compression;network packet;peak signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;streaming media;uk educational evidence portal;video coding format	Kairan Sun;Dapeng Wu	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2017.7996740	encoder;real-time computing;lossy compression;computer network;fountain code;wireless network;decoding methods;computer science;forward error correction;network packet	Mobile	-6.462554106099881	102.28730533368204	70592
ec10fd0c4af71fb54e03e74a65e74dbde701962b	end-to-end delay in mobile networks: does the traffic pattern matter?		Modern mobile communication networks react intelligently on user traffic in order to efficiently manage the scarce link bandwidth; for example, by offering high demand users high speed links.Reactiveness bears a central implication for active measurements, namely, the injected probing traffic defines the experienced network performance or, conversely, the obtained measurement results reflect the probing pattern. High precision end-to-end latency measurements therefore require the specification of the traffic pattern for reproducibility. This leads to a basic question: How accurate do these traffic patterns need to be modeled, in order to enable reproducible measurement results? To answer it, we perform active latency measurements in a public 3G HSPA network by employing various traffic patterns. We find that both packet size and packet inter-arrival time strongly affect the latency. Further, the respective history appears to have an influence and, finally, also correlations between both variables change the delay response of the network. This study motivates the deployment of highly sophisticated traffic models in the context of latency measurements, since any generalization of measurement results to arbitrary traffic patterns is shown to be questionable.

However, delivering video to high mobile vehicles faces challenges such as packet loss due to intermittent connectivity and channel variations. Thus, designing a reliable approach for video streaming over such harsh scenarios is needed. Hence, we propose a reliable approach based on random practical network coding and source coding. This approach integrates the benefits of network coding with Multiple Description Coding to achieve robust streaming over VANET. Furthermore, we propose a redundancy controller based on fuzzy inference system to adjust the amount of redundant packets based on vehicular traffic density and SNR of the channel. Simulation shows the proposed approach achieves better protection against packet loss, application layer throughput and video quality.	channel (communications);data compression;embedded system;fuzzy logic;inference engine;linear network coding;multiple description coding;nc (complexity);network packet;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;streaming media;throughput;video	Alberto J.

The Edge Router Discovery Protocol (ERDP) supports an edge router in a stationary core network in assigning network address prefixes to gateways in mobile ad-hoc networks. This paper focuses on how CP-nets and the CPN computer tools have been applied in the development of ERDP. A CPN model has been constructed that constitutes a formal executable specification of ERDP. Simulation and message sequence charts were used for initial investigations of the protocol’s behaviour. Then state space analysis was applied to conduct a formal verification of the key properties of ERDP. Both the modelling, simulation, and subsequent state space analysis helped in identifying several omissions and errors in the design, demonstrating the benefits of using formal modelling and analysis in a protocol design process.	cp/m;classless inter-domain routing;coloured petri net;communications protocol;executable;formal verification;hoc (programming language);message sequence chart;network address;router (computing);simulation;state space;stationary process;telebit	Lars Michael Kristensen;Kurt Jensen	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-27863-4_15	wireless ad hoc network;message passing;mobile ad hoc network;core network;design process;telecommunications;formal verification;computer science;state space;operating system;wireless network;formal specification;database;distributed computing;programming language;mobile computing;computer security;message sequence chart	Mobile	-23.228555481095224	91.2652308542667	70948

Previous multi-AP solutions are limited to stationary wireless clients and do not take into account a myriad of mobile factors. We show that connection duration, AP response times, channel scheduling, available and offered bandwidth, node speed, and dhcp joins all affect performance. Building on these results, we present a system, Spider, that establishes and maintains concurrent connections to 802.11 APs in a mobile environment. While Spider can manage multiple channels, we demonstrate that it achieves maximum throughput when using multiple APs on a single channel.	maximum throughput scheduling;scheduling (computing);stationary process	Hamed Soroush;Peter Gilbert;Nilanjan Banerjee;Mark D.

Recently, there is a growing interest in the impact of AAL2 trunking/switching on the digital telephone switching systems.

Despite the growing interest in this new extension, little is known about its behavior in real networks. We analyze a five-month trace collected on multipath-tcp.org using Multipath TCP. This first detailed study of real Multipath TCP traffic reveals several interesting points about its behavior in the wild. With packets from thousands of hosts using IPv4 and/or IPv6, we confirm that Multipath TCP correctly passes through a wide range of Internet paths. We observe long Multipath TCP connections that benefit from handovers and also connections composed of subflows having very different round-trip-times. We also analyze some inefficiencies in the current Multipath TCP implementations and quantify the importance of reinjections, i.e. the transmission of the same data over two or more subflows.	communications protocol;concurrency control;fastest;internet protocol suite;microtransaction;multihoming;multipath propagation;network congestion;network packet;smartphone;transmitter	Hoang Tran-Viet;Quentin De Coninck;Benjamin Hesmans;Ramin Sadre;Olivier Bonaventure	2016	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2016.01.014	real-time computing;tcp global synchronization;tcp westwood plus;tcp pacing;telecommunications;tcp hole punching;delay spread;zeta-tcp;hstcp;tcp tuning;tcp acceleration;tcp friendly rate control;computer network	Metrics	-5.435947815814359	92.05979567334442	71292

In this paper, using data from more than a hundred video publishers spanning two years, we characterize the video management plane and its evolution. The management plane shows significant diversity with respect to video packaging, playback device support, and CDN use, and current trends suggest increasing diversity in some of these dimensions. This diversity adds complexity to management, and we show that the complexity of many management tasks is sub-linearly correlated with the number of hours a publisher's content is viewed. Moreover, today each publisher runs an independent management plane, and this practice can lead to sub-optimal outcomes for syndicated content, such as redundancies in CDN storage and loss of control for content owners over delivery quality.	content delivery network;digital video;file spanning;ibm notes;management plane;requirement;server (computing);software project management;web syndication	Zahaib Akhtar;Yun Seong Nam;Jessica Chen;Ramesh Govindan;Ethan Katz-Bassett;Sanjay G.

It is then appropriate to wonder how this technology could a!ect the next generation satellite networks (from at least an interoperability standpoint) and if satellite network designers should implement MPLS on their space segment (and if yes, how?). These are the main questions that this paper is addressing. We will show how MPLS can be used on top of any layer 2 technology on the space segment, to provide IP QoS. In particular we will discuss MPLS over ATM over satellite where MPLS is essentially used to control and manage an on-board ATM switch fabric. Problems with MPLS and solutions will be presented. As the digital video broadcast (DVB) standard is becoming popular to be used on both the forward and return link, the di!erentmethods to carry IP over DVBwill also be discussed.

MPEG-4 and H.264 are compression standards targeted at high-quality streamed multimedia services over wireless best-effort IP networks. However, the dynamic nature of wireless networks in terms of fluctuating bandwidth and time-varying delays makes it difficult to provide good quality streaming under such constraints. Multimedia streaming applications are a demanding and challenging service to deliver over wireless networks. There is a trade-off between the capacity of the wireless network and the quality of the multimedia streaming application. In this paper we investigate the effect the background traffic load has on unicast streaming video sessions. We show that above a certain load value, the video streaming session is slowly starved of bandwidth. The load value at which this occurs depends on the characteristics of the background traffic load in terms of packet rates and the number of sources contributing to the load.	bandwidth (signal processing);best-effort delivery;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;internet protocol suite;network packet;performance evaluation;streaming media;unicast	Nicola Cranley;Mark E Davis	2005		10.1145/1089737.1089759	best-effort delivery;real-time computing;performance;computer science;evaluation;operating system;wireless network;multimedia;streaming current;mpeg-4;wireless multimedia extensions;encoding;computer network	Metrics	-6.936602542229178	99.26159237606842	71435

Despite the central role that PMTUD plays in the Internet communication, it has a long history of software bugs, failures and misconfigurations. In this work we explore the benefits versus drawbacks of PMTUD in the Internet from the clients and servers perspective. First, we examine the fraction of clients that use PMTUD. To that end we analyse ICMP PTB messages in CAIDA Internet Traces and show that the fraction of networks using PMTUD is negligible and that this number is further decreasing over the period of 2008 - 2016. Second, we evaluate the fraction of popular web servers that support the PMTUD mechanism and show that a large number of the servers block """"ICMP packet too big"""" messages. On the other hand, we show easy and efficient - even though well-known - degradation of service attacks that exploit the availability of PMTUD. Since the benefit of PMTUD is questionable, and in contrast it exposes to degradation of service attacks, we advocate to stop using it.

MIP-BT provides mobility by establishing bi-directional tunnel from home agent to mobile node's care-of address. Although it does not require multicast tree reconstruction, it suffers from redundant routing that causes packet delivery delay and network bandwidth consumption. On the other hand, MIP-RS provides mobility by reconstructing multicast tree when mobile node enters a foreign network. Although MIP-RS provides shortest multicast routing path, it requires the reconstruction of entire multicast tree in case of source mobility and causes service disruption during the process of handover. To cope with those problems, we propose new source mobility scheme that enjoys the advantages of MIP-RS and provides seamless handover with the help of proxy router, which assists handover by swapping network addresses and conducting packet forwarding. We examine the deployment issues of the proposed scheme over the Internet and evaluate the proposed scheme from the viewpoint of routing distance and network bandwidth consumption through simulation experiments with various parameters, and then clarify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme	care-of address;denial-of-service attack;experiment;internet;mobile ip;multicast;network packet;paging;router (computing);routing;seamless3d;simulation;software deployment;tunneling protocol	Takeshi Takahashi;Koichi Asatani;Hideyoshi Tominaga	2005	2nd International Conference on Broadband Networks, 2005.	10.1109/ICBN.2005.1589690	link state packet;multicast;the internet;ip multicast;inter-domain;telecommunications;protocol independent multicast;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;distributed computing;packet forwarding;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;mobile computing;xcast;mobile ip;computer network;multicast address;bandwidth allocation	Mobile	-10.752113383280777	89.59035940522958	71587
9c18a9faa636eadfc6cea0394b6c0c5fb623c88e	on the naming and binding of network destinations		Status of this Memo This memo provides information for the Internet community. It does not specify an Internet standard. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. Abstract This brief paper offers a perspective on the subject of names of destinations in data communication networks. It suggests two ideas: First, it is helpful to distinguish among four different kinds of objects that may be named as the destination of a packet in a network. Second, the operating system concept of binding is a useful way to describe the relations among the four kinds of objects. To illustrate the usefulness of this approach, the paper interprets some more subtle and confusing properties of two real-world network systems for naming destinations.

Despite a very helpful effort of John Shoch [1] to impose some organization on the discussion of names, addresses, and routes to destinations in computer networks, these discussions continue to be more confusing than one would expect. This confusion stems sometimes from making too tight an association between various types of network Saltzer [Page 1]	attachments;computer networks (journal);international federation for information processing;internet;name binding;network packet;operating system;telecommunications network	Jerome H.

Mobile node (MN) does not participate in mobility-related signaling in PMIPv6. PMIPv6 can support multi-homing hosts with the help of virtual interface to perform inter-technology handover or to support flow mobility. However, a single virtual interface has the problem of swapping link-layer identifier (LL-ID) when the neighbor discovery is performed after inter-technology handover. Whenever the single virtual interface receives an Neighbor Solicitation (NS) message, the virtual interface analyzes the NS message and it changes the LL-ID of virtual interface to the LL-ID of physical interface for keeping communication. This approach is not natural and is not recommended because it has a security problem. In this paper, the efficient inter-technology handover scheme with the multiple virtual interfaces are proposed to solve the problem of swapping LL-ID with Proxy Neighbor Advertisement message in Neighbor Discovery. This paper explains the difference based on the result of comparison with a single virtual interface. NS-3 simulation is performed to provide a clear and practical procedure of multiple virtual interfaces in PMIPv6 network.	auto-id labs;caller id;identifier;ll parser;multihoming;multiple homing;paging;proxy mobile ipv6;simulation	Seong-Mun Kim;Hyon-Young Choi;Hyo-Beom Lee;Sung-Gi Min;Youn-Hee Han	2012	2012 IEEE Globecom Workshops	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2012.6477722	computer science;network interface;operating system;distributed computing;mobility model;mobile computing;world wide web;computer network	Visualization	-11.110671758060898	89.40823965459595	71855

Targeting the inadequacy of counting/accounting capabilities of existing rou ters, many data streaming and sketching techniques have been proposed to estimate the important statistics of traffic goi n through a network link. Most of these techniques are, however, developed to track one specific statistic and/or answe r a specific type of query. Since there are a large number of such statistics and queries of interest, it is very difficult , if not impossible, for network vendors and operators to implement and deploy data streaming/sketching solutions for all of them, due to router resource (memory, CPU, bus bandwidth, etc.) constraints. In this paper, we propose a general-purpose solution that can not only answer a wide range of queries, but also be able to answer types of queries that were not known a priori. In particular, we introduce the use of the Conditional Random Sampling (CRS) sketch data structure for succinctly capturing network traffic data between a set of nodes in the network. This sketch is the first step towards a “universal” sketch data structure in the sense that it is not tied to measurement of a single quantity. We show that the CRS sketch can compute unbiased estimates for any linear summary statistic in the intersection of a pair of traffic stream s, e.g., traffic and flow matrix information, flow counts, and entropy. We present detailed experiments, using data collect ed at a tier-1 ISP, that show that our sketch is capable of estimating this wide range of statistics with fairly high accura cy.	central processing unit;chinese internet slang;cylinder-head-sector;data structure;experiment;floor and ceiling functions;general-purpose modeling;network packet;packet analyzer;router (computing);sketch;tier 1 network	Haiquan Zhao;Nan Hua;Ashwin Lall;Ping Li;Jia Wang;Jun Xu	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-24403-2_17	parallel computing;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system;data mining;database;distributed computing;world wide web;computer security;statistics;computer network	Metrics	-6.482763562506132	89.94894448837837	71932

Although quick detection of communication and software failures are important to improve users’ satisfaction, such a quick detection is difficult because the services are served by many servers, network nodes and mobile terminals. Thus we developed the anomaly detection technique for the mobile operator’s network to detect anomalies caused by communication failures such as server and network halts. Our technique is based on the observation that users reconnect to servers many times when a communication failure occurs. It is useful not only to detect such communication failures, but also those which would be caused by software failures of mobile terminals and servers. This means that a mobile operator would be able to detect software failures missed at the testing period. In this paper, we empirically study how our technique is used to detect software failures of mobile terminals.	algorithm;anomaly detection;asynchronous i/o;distributed computing;email;gerber format;handbook;ip multimedia subsystem;institute of electronics, information and communication engineers;international federation for information processing;internet;john d. wiley;marina;mobile phone;nagios core;real-time transcription;retransmission (data networks);sensor;server (computing);signal processing;simple network management protocol;software bug;software testing;terminal emulator	Hiroyuki Shinbo;Toru Hasegawa	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-24580-0_14	real-time computing;mobile search;mobile database;engineering;mobile computing;world wide web;computer security	Mobile	-4.571254121625421	90.01066596254586	72083

However, since there is no incentive for contributing contents or resources to others, users may attempt to obtain content without any contribution. To motivate users to contribute their resources to the service, incentive-rewarding mechanisms have been proposed. On the other hand, emerging wireless technologies, such as IEEE 802.11 wireless local area networks, beyond third generation (B3G) cellular networks and mobile WiMAX, provide high-speed Internet access for wireless users. Using these high-speed wireless access, wireless users can use P2P services and share their content with other wireless users and with fixed users. However, this diversification of access networks makes it difficult to appropriately assign rewards to each user according to their contributions. This is because the cost necessary for contribution is different in different access networks. In this paper, we propose a novel incentive-rewarding mechanism called EMOTIVER that can assign rewards to users appropriately. The proposed mechanism uses an external evaluator and interactive learning agents. We also investigate a way of appropriately controlling rewards based on the system service's quality and managing policy.

HAPs are meant to be as unmanned aerial vehicles, airships or aircrafts, which remain relatively stationary in the stratosphere at short distance from Earth compared to satellites. In the scientific literature, there is evidence of the effectiveness of a UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications Systems) system augmented by the presence of HAPs, which are equipped with UMTS payloads and play the role of additional base stations. This integrated terrestrial-space platform intrinsically fits the exigencies of rural and emergency scenarios, which are characterized by network resource scarcity, due to either geographical reasons (such as in rural areas) or to temporary resource over-utilization-reduction (due to emergency status). In this paper, the focus is on the delivery of Multimedia Broadcast-Multicast Services (MBMS) in the reference integrated architecture. Main objectives are designing resource allocation policies to manage multicast groups between space and terrestrial coverages, and analysing their feasibility and performances in terms of offered grade of service.

Diversity in application usage however, makes isolated application prioritization a performance caveat for users with varying application trends. The present paper proposes a user profiling approach to capture application trends based on generic flow measurements (NetFlow) and employs the extracted profiles to create DC traffic forwarding policies. The scheme allows operators to define a global profile and application hierarchy based on extracted profiles to prioritize traffic for individual user classes. The proposed design was tested by extracting user profiles from a realistic enterprise network, and further simulated to dynamically manage DC traffic using the software defined networking paradigm. Compared to conventional traffic management schemes, the frame delivery ratio and effective throughput of our design was significantly higher for high priority north-south user traffic as well as the inter-server east-west application traffic.	data center;inter-server;load balancing (computing);mike lesser;overselling;programming paradigm;provisioning;real-time clock;scalability;server (computing);software-defined networking;throughput;user profile	Taimur Bakhshi;Bogdan V.

An HAS player periodically requests pre-encoded video chunks by sending an HTTP GET message. When the downloading a video chunk is finished, the player estimates the network bandwidth by calculating the goodput and adjusts the video quality based on its estimates. However, the bandwidth estimation in application layer is pretty inaccurate due to its architectural limitation. We show that inaccurate bandwidth estimation in rate adaptation may incur serious rate oscillations which is poor quality-of-experience for users. In this paper, we propose a buffer-based rate adaptation scheme which eliminates the bandwidth estimation step in rate adaptation to provide a smooth playback of HTTP-based streaming. We evaluate the performance of the HAS player implemented in the ns-3 network simulator. Our simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves the stability by replacing bandwidth estimation with buffer occupancy estimation.	bandwidth management;client-side;download;goodput;hypertext transfer protocol;motion estimation;playout;simulation;web server	Jiwoo Park;Kwangsue Chung	2016	2016 International Conference on Information Networking (ICOIN)	10.1109/ICOIN.2016.7427112	estimation;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;bandwidth;statistics;computer network	Mobile	-6.83485441300706	98.61569009999702	72402

Notably, one of the more intriguing approaches has been blending on-device caching and device-to-device (D2D) communications. While various past research has pointed to potentially significant gains (30%+) via redundancy elimination (RE), some skepticism has emerged to whether or not such gains are truly harnessable in practice. The premise of this paper is to explore whether or not significant potential for redundancy elimination exists and whether the rise of video and encryption might blunt said efforts. Critically, we find that absent significant synchronized interests of mobile users, the actual redundancy falls well short of the promising values from the literature. In our paper, we investigate the roots for said shortcomings by exploring RE savings with regards to cache hit characteristics and to what extent client and domain diversity contribute to the realized redundancy savings.	alpha compositing;cache (computing);encryption;mobile device	Xueheng Hu;Aaron Striegel	2016	CoRR		real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications	Web+IR	-21.606179884471967	98.20270471957927	72605

Their accuracy significantly improves with an optimization, called conservative update, which is especially effective when the aim is to discriminate a relatively small number of heavy hitters in a traffic stream consisting of an extremely large number of flows. Despite its widespread application, a thorough understanding of the conservative update operation has lagged behind, perhaps because of the significant modeling complexity involved. In this work we attempt to fill this gap. Our proposed modeling approach builds on a practically important empirical finding: simulation results (as well as experimental ones over real traffic traces) obtained for skewed load scenarios exhibit a sharp waterfall-type behaviour. That is, the approximate count provided by the sketch response remains accurate until an “error floor” is reached. Flows below this error flow level are on average approximated by the same error floor count value, irrespective of their exact count. The error floor itself appears to be maximal in the case of uniform load. Leveraging the simplifications made possible when the load is uniform, we derive an analytic model capable of accurately predicting the transient growth behavior of the (tightly correlated) counters deployed in the data structure and obtain an upper bound on the error floor level.	approximation algorithm;data structure;error floor;glossary of computer graphics;mathematical optimization;maximal set;scalability;simulation;tracing (software)	Giuseppe Bianchi;Ken R.

Please refer to the current edition of the """"Internet Official Protocol Standards"""" (STD 1) for the standardization state and status of this protocol. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. Abstract This document specifies a per-domain path computation technique for establishing inter-domain Traffic Engineering (TE) Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs). In this document, a domain refers to a collection of network elements within a common sphere of address management or path computational responsibility such as Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) areas and Autonomous Systems. Per-domain computation applies where the full path of an inter-domain TE LSP cannot be or is not determined at the ingress node of the TE LSP, and is not signaled across domain boundaries. This is most likely to arise owing to TE visibility limitations. The signaling message indicates the destination and nodes up to the next domain boundary. It may also indicate further domain boundaries or domain identifiers. The path through each domain, possibly including the choice of exit point from the domain, must be determined within the domain."""	autonomous system (internet);computation;generalized multi-protocol label switching;identifier;inter-domain;internet;multiprotocol label switching;std bus;test engineer	Jean-Philippe Vasseur;Arthi Ayyangar;Raymond Zhang	2008	RFC	10.17487/RFC5152	telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Networks	-24.857291758765765	88.70226411432925	72971

The real challenge of using the hash chains is how it could recover the synchronization state and continue keeping the hash link in case of packet loss? Based on the packet loss tolerance and some accepted delay of video delivery which are representing the permitted tolerance for heavy loaded applications, we propose different mechanisms for such synchronization recovery. Each mechanism is suitable to use according to the video use case and the low capabilities of end devices. This paper proposes comparative results between them based on the status of each one and its overhead. Then, we propose a hybrid technique based Redundancy Code (RC). This hybrid algorithm is simulated and compared analytically against the other techniques (SHHC, TSP, MLHC and TSS). Moreover, a global performance evaluation in terms of delay and overhead is conducted for all techniques.	data integrity;hash chain;hash function;hybrid algorithm;markov chain;message authentication;network packet;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;streaming media	Emad Abd-Elrahman;Mohammed Boutabia;Hossam Afifi	2011	J.

However, it describes this interface almost entirely from the network's viewpoint. Investigations within ANSI X3S3 in 1980 showed that X.25 leaves open many issues regarding DTE operation. As a result, ISO/TC97/SC6, at ANSI's request, undertook an activity to define DTE operation for both DTE-to-DCE (network) operation as well as direct DTE-to-DTE operation. In June 1981, ISO/TC97/SC6 approved for balloting among its member countries a draft proposal of an X.25 LAPB-compatible DTE link layer standard. The results of this balloting were favourable; the DP was then forwarded to ISO/TC97 for further processing as a draft international standard. A proposed X.25 DTE packet layer standard has been submitted to ISO for further consideration within TC97/SC6. The purpose of this paper is to briefly trace the history of this activity and to provide insight into the proposed ISO DTE standards.

In such a framework other works have highlighted the need of a coordination between the access signaling protocols and the transport level resource reservation mechanisms. In this work we propose a general method and coordination of these transport level mechanisms between SIP entities and the QoS DiffServ architecture supposed to act as the interconnecting network. A re-defined version of COPS developed in our laboratories is used for authorization/resource allocation requesting; such protocol re-definition is optimized for managing the multimedia flows when requesting access to the DiffServ architecture so making able a SIP server to commit resources for the calls that it is managing. The procedures needed to establish the QoS call over a multidomain DiffServ scenario will be discussed; the needed procedures are dynamically started at call set-up time avoiding the users from drafting unsatisfactory static Service Level Agreements (SLAs). The paper focus is about architectural considerations and proposal beyond the underlying architecture, design issues and implementation report and testing.	access control;authorization;cell signaling;differentiated services;entity;finite-state machine;functional testing;integrated services;network architecture;outsourcing;performance evaluation;provisioning;quality of service;server (computing);service-level agreement;signaling protocol;testbed;uptime	Stefano Giordano;M.

2ea21e0661cd49837895c7c0f8fd4dcf135cfe4c	3d audio conference system with backward compatible conference server using hrtf synthesis		This article describes a system that is able to perform online sound localization, separation and speaker recognition for the purpose of channel assignment in teleconferencing scenarios. The assigned channels are then virtually synthesized to different positions around the listener by a conference server using Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs), which enables the user to identify active speakers in an audio conference. Intelligibility of communication is also increased by making use of the cocktail party effect which describes how a user can concentrate on one specific participant, even if there are more simultaneously active speakers. To support regular telephone systems, we focus in particular on compatibility to existing Voice over IP (VoIP) infrastructure by using standardized protocols and central signal processing. Both traditional telephone devices and software clients are put into one heterogeneous conference. While the conference server transmits the down-mixed, single-channel conference signal to regular phones, the software clients can receive a stereosignal enabling full 3D audio.	backward compatibility;head-related transfer function;intelligibility (philosophy);powered speakers;server (computing);signal processing;speaker recognition	Martin Rothbucher;Matthias Kaufmann;Johannes Feldmaier;Tim Habigt;Marko Durkovic;Christoph Kozielski;Klaus Diepold	2011	JMPT		speech recognition;computer science;multimedia;communication	Visualization	-21.964928745698852	94.03825173332841	74237

In wide area deployment, heavy signaling traffic and the handoff latencies due to mobile IP registration could be high if the distance between the visited network and the home network of a Mobile Node is large. Also, base stations with small cells yield frequent handoffs, and requiring a registration with a distant Home Agent and Correponding Nodes for each such local handoff increases overheads and further aggravnks packet loss. This paper, proposes an approxh to allowing Mobile Nodes to use a cascaded hmneling scheme in a mobile m network, called Painfer F a n w d h g MIpV6 MobiUy MnMgenKnf (PFMIM) strategy. This approach reduces the EOSI of updating distant Home Agent and Corresponding Nodes, which greatly reduces the number of signaling messages ia the network Furthermore, the Tunneling Chain ofa Mobile Node is determined dynamically with no need for preliminary definitions of static anchors or regions. The results of this work demonstrate that the new stratew yields simple mobility scheme that extends pointer forwarding method to achieve low cost binding and delivery opmtions [9]. This PFMIPv6 scheme introduces a new function, the Pointer Forwarding Mobility Agent (PFMA), the functionality of PFMA is distributed across all of the access routers (AR). Each PFMA serves a single Mobility Domain (MD), which, in tum consists of an aggregation of links that form a contiguous geographical region. Each MN dynamically changes its Current MD and PFMA according to its movement. The CN operation will not be affected. The proposed scheme reduces the cost of binding, using a chain of PFMAs that comects the MN to its HA. When wishing to send a message to the MN, the CN sends the message to the first PFMA, referred to as the heading PFMA. (The message may be intercepted by the HA.) The message is forwarded fiom that agent point along the chain until it reaches the MN. Fig. 1 illustrates the network model under consideration.

The proposed framework suggests an unified approach to employ various media formats, enable multicast-connectivity and display highresolution videos. It includes media controllers to enable DV (digital video) and HDV (high-definition DV) streaming, announce sessions, and guide the adaptive QoS control. It includes media connectors to enable using UDP tunneling to offer multicast-connectivity. Finally, it supports media producers/consumers to encode, transmit, decode, and render high-quality media. We explore the possibility of proposed framework by implementing a prototype and evaluating it over multicast-enabled network testbed.	access grid;digital video;encode;hdmi;media controls;multicast;prototype;quality of service;session (computer science);testbed;tunneling protocol	Sangwoo Han;Namgon Kim;Jaeyoun Kim;JongWon Kim	2006	IEEE International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications, 2006.	10.1109/AICCSA.2006.205183	quality of service;computer science;prototype;multimedia;world wide web;computer network;collaboration	Visualization	-10.838859524185326	96.7922336025385	74767

The study consists of quantifying the costs of switches, trunk and loop plant, building, and outside plant enclosures in order to determine the most economical number of switching nodes in the study areas based on the current equipment and land/building prices as well as the expected prices in the 1995 time frame. The results of this study show that the network architectures with fewer but larger switching nodes accompanied by back hauling of traffic via fiber optics and large multiplexers/concentrators offer significant savings potential in rural/suburban areas and low-to-moderate savings in urban areas as compared to architectures with many smaller switching nodes. In a broadband network environment, the results are shown to be valid for small penetrations of broadband services (less than 10%) and small broadband call bandwidths (equal to or less than 45 Mb/s). >	telecommunications network	Shyam L.

64fd5fd0125143334ead315f4e841bc509c0e90c	a quality of experience management framework for mobile users		Voice transmission is no longer the main usage of mobile phones. Data transmissions, in particular Internet access, are very common actions that we might perform with these devices. However, the spectacular growth of the mobile data demand in G mobile communication systems leads to a reduction of the resources assigned to each device. Therefore, to avoid situations in which the Quality of Experience (QoE) would be negatively affected, an automated system for degradation detection of video streaming is proposed. This approach is named QoE Management for Mobile Users (QoEMU). QoEMU is composed of several modules to perform a real-time analysis of the network traffic, select a mitigation action according to the information of the traffic and to some predefined policies, and apply these actions. In order to perform such tasks, the best Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for a given set of video traces are selected. A QoE Model is trained to define a global QoE for the set of traces. When an alert regarding degradation in the quality appears, a proper mitigation plan is activated to mitigate this situation. The performance of QoEMU has been evaluated over a degradation situation experiments with different video users.

Furthermore, this approach eliminates handovers from high to low data rate networks; e.g., handovers that occur from WLAN to a general packet radio service (GPRS) network. Therefore, the proposed approach avoids the drastic drop in the data rate when handovers occur from high to low data rate wireless networks. We also develop an analytical framework to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach.	code coverage;data rate units;network packet	Ariton E. Xhafa;Ozan K.

A recent example are the various types of virtual private network (VPN) applications that carry customer traffic over public networks creating the illusion of a private network for each customer. Still, due to the difficulty of aggregating multicast destination addresses, multicasting suffers from the forwarding state scalability problems. In this work we investigate how the problem of multicast state scalability re-emerges in the VPN setting and how it can be effectively addressed there using the MPLS label based forwarding paradigm.	centralized computing;computation;multicast;multipoint ground;multiprotocol label switching;point-to-multipoint communication;programming paradigm;quality of service;requirement;scalability;signaling protocol;virtual private network;whole earth 'lectronic link	George Apostolopoulos;Ioana Ciurea	2005	10th IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC'05)	10.1109/ISCC.2005.132	multiprotocol label switching;information and communications technology;routing;application software;multicast;scalability;ip multicast;inter-domain;spine;reliable multicast;telecommunications;protocol independent multicast;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;distributed computing;quantum tunnelling;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;xcast;computer network;multicast address;unicast	Networks	-12.644645741000788	88.96924530543191	75589

In this paper we present an algorithm that uses Weighted Least Squares Regression to predict whether a given link can meet application requirements in terms of throughput, delay, and jitter. We use a simulation study to demonstrate that our algorithm is able to predict link quality accurately and stably in a frequently changing mobile environment. The prediction algorithm is more accurate than several alternative algorithms, and the overhead caused by the link measurements is negligible in terms of throughput and power consumption.	algorithm;least squares;on the fly;overhead (computing);requirement;simulation;throughput	Qiuyi Duan;Lei Wang;Charles D.

140d16a8f7a903279e27c479145693c8dd4b3efd	cost-effective approach inter-lma domain management and distributed mobility control scheme in proxy mobile ipv6 networks	distributed mobility control;pig;global mobility;proxy mobile ipv6;mobile network	The Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is designed to provide network-based mobility management support to a mobile node (MN) without any involvement of the MN in mobility related signaling; hence, the proxy mobility entity performs all related signaling on behalf of the MN. The new principal functional entities of PMIPv6 are the local mobility anchor (LMA) and the mobile access gateway (MAG). In PMIPv6, all the data traffic sent from the MN gets routed to the LMA through a tunnel between the LMA and the MAG, but it still has a single point of failure (SPOF) and a bottleneck state of traffic. To solve these problems, various approaches directed towards PMIPv6 performance improvements, such as route optimization, have been proposed. However, these approaches add additional signaling to support the MN's mobility, which incurs extra network overhead and still provides difficulty when applied to multiple-LMA networks. In this paper, we propose an improved route optimization in PMIPv6-based multiple-LMA networks. All LMAs were connected to the proxy internetworking gateway (PIG), which performs inter-domain distributed mobility control. Each MAG keeps the information of all LMAs in the PMIPv6 domain, so it is possible to perform fast route optimization. Therefore, this method supported route optimization without any additional signaling because the LMA receives the state information of route optimization from the PIG.	proxy mobile ipv6	Soonho Jang;Jongpil Jeong	2015	Inf.

1c6ce2d2af386f7d84219b8d228970a008302f84	a test bed study of network determinism for heterogeneous traffic using time-triggered ethernet		Future tactical communications involves high data rate best effort traffic working alongside real-time traffic for time-critical applications with hard deadlines. Unavailable bandwidth and/or untimely responses may lead to undesired or even catastrophic outcomes. Ethernet-based communication systems are one of the major tactical network standards due to the higher bandwidth, better utilization, and ability to handle heterogeneous traffic. However, Ethernet suffers from inconsistent performance for jitter, latency and bandwidth under heavy loads. The emerging Time-Triggered Ethernet (TTE) solutions promise deterministic Ethernet performance, fault-tolerant topologies and real-time guarantees for critical traffic. In this paper we study the TTE protocol and build a TTTech TTE test bed to evaluate its performance. Through experimental study, the TTE protocol was observed to provide consistent high data rates for best effort messages, determinism with very low jitter for time-triggered messages, and fault-tolerance for minimal packet loss using redundant networking topologies. In addition, challenges were observed that presented a trade-off between the integration cycle and the synchronization overhead. It is concluded that TTE is a capable solution to support heterogeneous traffic in time-critical applications, such as aerospace systems (eg. airplanes, spacecraft, etc.), ground-based vehicles (eg. trains, buses, cars, etc), and cyber-physical systems (eg. smart-grids, IoT, etc.).	best-effort delivery;cyber-physical system;data rate units;experiment;fault tolerance;gigabit;network packet;overhead (computing);real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;testbed;window of opportunity	Allen Starke;D.

Two major mobile telecommunication standards have dominated the global wireless market, namely, TDMA/CDMA developed by TIA in North America and GSM developed by ETSI in Europe. As we move toward 3 generation wireless, there is a need to develop standards, which are more global and collaborative. Recently, the global wireless industry has created two new partnership projects to address this issue: • 3 Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) [1] ,which is developing 3G standards for GSM based systems. The consortium includes ETSI, T1 (North America.), ARIB/TTC (Japan), TTA (Korea) and CWTS (China). The North American TDMA community is participating and contributing in 3GPP as ANSI-41 based TDMA systems evolve towards 3G architecture based on EDGE and GPRS. • 3 Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) [2], which is developing 3G standards for IS-95 based CDMA systems. The consortium includes TIA (N.A.), ARIB/TTC, TTA and CWTS.	broadcast markup language;television interface adaptor	Girish Patel;Steven Dennett	2000	IEEE Personal Commun.	10.1109/98.863998	gsm;code division multiple access;electronic circuit;the internet;data signaling rate;network architecture;core network;telecommunications;computer science;telephony;computer security;transport layer;time division multiple access;standardization;circuit switching;computer network;broadband networks	Mobile	-17.110554421177227	92.04964933050948	76231

The design and performance of the developed components like session management, real-time scheduler and a specific transport system are outlined. The core of the framework consists of a toolkit for the processing of audio and video data. It integrates capturing, compression, transmission and presentation of media streams into an object oriented class library. The specifics of audio/video hardware, preferred operation modes, compression algorithms and transport protocol properties are encapsulated. Due to the achieved abstraction level complex application software can easily be developed resulting in very short design cycles. Contrary to existing systems the developed application is regarded in its entirety. The focus on highest possible performance throughout all components is unique to our approach. Due to a number of optimisations, specific compression hardware is not required which leads to low overall system costs.

f085f74a26d8d7118996fe08501861abb77a3f19	fast: fine-grained and scalable tcp for cloud data center networks	scalable congestion control;kpubs;kpubs org;virtual congestion window;cloud data center networks	With the increasing usage of cloud applications such as MapReduce and social networking, the amount of data traffic in data center networks continues to grow. Moreover, these appli-cations follow the incast traffic pattern, where a large burst of traffic sent by a number of senders, accumulates simultaneously at the shallow-buffered data center switches. This causes severe packet losses. The currently deployed TCP is custom-tailored for the wide-area Internet. This causes cloud applications to suffer long completion times towing to the packet losses, and hence, results in a poor quality of service. An Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)-based approach is an attractive solution that conservatively adjusts to the network congestion in advance. This legacy approach, however, lacks scalability in terms of the number of flows. In this paper, we reveal the primary cause of the scalability issue through analysis, and propose a new congestion-control algorithm called FaST. FaST employs a novel, virtual congestion window to conduct fine-grained congestion control that results in improved scalability. Fur-thermore, FaST is easy to deploy since it requires only a few software modifications at the server-side. Through ns-3 simulations, we show that FaST improves the scalability of data center networks compared with the existing approaches.

This is happening thanks to various number of home appliances that can connect wireless to the Internet, as witnessed by the recent launch of Sony Bravia. For this reason there is an interest, in the research community, to design and develop the protocol architecture of Home Entertainment Centers (HECs). HECs are entertainment hubs capable to handle heterogeneous media, thus behaving as gateways, and to support the main multimedia services (e.g., TVs, game consoles, etc.) at home. As the interactivity of these services is crucial to guarantee a satisfactory quality of service to the end user, it is important to understand which protocols HECs have to use to exchange data and how these perform on a home wireless link. Following recent findings that confirm that TCP still occupies the lion share of Internet residential traffic, the scope of this paper is to show that among the most used and popular candidates, TCP Westwood is capable to best adapt to a home scenario that entails an increase of the bandwidth requirements and a widespread use of wireless connections.	gateway (telecommunications);interactivity;quality of service;requirement	Gustavo Marfia;Marco Roccetti	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo	10.1109/ICME.2010.5583267	telecommunications;computer science;internet privacy;wireless;computer network	Mobile	-17.83578981142396	95.55143506627445	76342

On the other hand, Application Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol provides ISP-friendly communication by provisioning network related information to the applications. In this paper, we propose a method for selecting appropriate video server using SDN and ALTO in content distribution network (CDN) based video streaming systems.

Since the major computational parts of game processing are performed in datacenters, effectively assigning the resources (e.g. memory, bandwidth) to gaming sessions plays a key role in providing a high quality gaming experience to end-users. In this paper, we propose a traffic policing and shaping method using the Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm to solve the bandwidth allocation problem in cloud gaming datacenter networks. Our proposed method considers the current status of the datacenter paths in terms of remaining bandwidth and delay to achieve fair bandwidth allocation. The proposed scheme optimizes bandwidth utilization while ensuring compliance with the threshold of tolerable delay in cloud gaming systems. Our experimental results show that the proposed method improves bandwidth utilization and reduces end-to-end delay and delay variation (jitter) by almost 12% and 9%, respectively, without engendering additional packet loss compared to a representative conventional method: Equal Cost Multi-path (ECMP). These reductions lead to improvements in players' gaming experience.	bandwidth (signal processing);cloud gaming;data center;display resolution;end-to-end principle;equal-cost multi-path routing;laptop;network packet;noise shaping;programming paradigm;smartphone;software-defined networking;thin client;traffic shaping	Maryam Amiri;Hussein Al Osman;Shervin Shirmohammadi	2016	2016 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia (ISM)	10.1109/ISM.2016.0124	real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;software-defined networking;world wide web;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network;bandwidth allocation	Arch	-7.700756249319775	98.76341153003388	76448

Our goal is to shorten the download times by improving the uplink utilization of nodes. We develop a new family of uplink allocation algorithms which we call BitMax, to stress the fact that they allocate to each unchoked node the maximum rate it can sustain, instead of an 1/(k + 1) equal share as done in the existing BitTorrent. BitMax computes in each interval the number of nodes to be unchoked, and the corresponding allocations, and thus does not require any empirically preset parameters like k. We demonstrate experimentally that Bit-Max can reduce significantly the download times in a typical reference scenario involving mostly ADSL nodes. We also consider scenarios involving network bottlenecks caused by filtering of P2P traffic at ISP peering points and show that BitMax retains its gains also in these cases.	algorithm;asymmetric digital subscriber line;bittorrent;bottleneck (software);download;experiment;memory management;peering;telecommunications link	Nikolaos Laoutaris;Damiano Carra;Pietro Michiardi	2008		10.1145/1544012.1544030	real-time computing;divide and conquer algorithms;bittorrent;computer science;peer-to-peer;distributed computing;computer network;bandwidth allocation	Networks	-8.911224509848573	96.05061774953644	76495

The anycast packet is transmitted to one appropriate node selected out of all the nodes assigned to the same anycast address. Although it is expected that anycast will be used in various ways, the use of anycast is quite limited today. This is because anycast functionalities are still unclear, and it is difficult to realize a global anycast that requires existing routing protocols to be radically changed. In this paper, we clarify and classify some essential anycast issues and propose a new and practical communication architecture, based on mobile IPv6 architecture, that overcomes the anycast difficulties.	anycast;communications of the acm;data validation;hercules graphics card;load balancing (computing);mobile ip;network packet;routing;state (computer science);stateful firewall	Masakazu Hashimoto;Shingo Ata;Hiroshi Kitamura;Masayuki Murata	2006	International Symposium on Applications and the Internet (SAINT'06)	10.1109/SAINT.2006.42	anycast;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;routing protocol;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	Arch	-11.787811731247489	89.51920047827099	76640

Among all multimedia data, video is the most difficult to handle, both in terms of its size and the scarcity of tools and techniques available for efficient delivery, storage and retrieval. Providing tools to help users search and browse large collections of video documents is important. Equally important are the means to deliver and present the essence of video content to the user without noticeable delay. In this paper, we focus on the characterization of video by means of automatic analysis of its visual content and the compact presentation of the underlying story content built upon the derived characteristics. We develop models to capture and characterize video by temporal events, namely, dialogues, actions and story units. We then present these events using succinct visual summaries that depict and differentiate the underlying dramatic elements in an intuitive manner. The combination of video characterization and visual summary offers significant compaction of data size in video far beyond the numbers achieved by traditional video compression, while retaining essential meanings and semantics of the content, and is particularly useful for digital library and Internet applications.© (1997) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

The efficiency and user satisfaction highly depend on the constructed overlays. The common neighbor selection algorithms in existing overlay construction schemes usually randomly select a fixed number of neighbors which satisfy the selection requirements, such as end-to-end delay or a peerpsilas sojourn time. However, this fixed random neighbor-selection algorithm (FRNS) neglects the peerspsila upload bandwidth heterogeneity and therefore, the upload bandwidth cannot be efficiently used. In this paper, we propose a variable random neighbor-selection (VRNS) scheme to alleviate the problems due to bandwidth heterogeneity, and in which the number of neighbors with different upload bandwidths is dynamically determined by the statistical bandwidth information of the system. Our proposed scheme is shown to outperform FRNS based upon a large volume of carefully designed simulations.	computer user satisfaction;end-to-end principle;ergodic theory;peer-to-peer;randomness;requirement;rich internet application;selection algorithm;simulation;upload	Jagannath Ghoshal;Miao Wang;Lisong Xu;Byrav Ramamurthy	2008	2008 5th International Conference on Broadband Communications, Networks and Systems	10.1109/BROADNETS.2008.4769101	computer science;end-to-end delay;distributed computing;world wide web;statistics;computer network;satisfiability	DB	-9.161355216222617	96.66124286974745	76719

Existing methods typically use bitrate and global statistics of stalling events as the QoE indicators. This is problematic for two reasons. First, using the same bitrate to encode different video content could result in drastically different presentation QoE. Second, the interactions between presentation visual quality and playback stalling are not accounted for. Here we propose a novel QoE prediction approach that takes into consideration the instantaneous quality degradation due to perceptual video presentation impairment, the playback stalling events caused by imperfect network delivery, and the instantaneous interactions between presentation quality and playback stalling. The proposed algorithm demonstrates strong promise when tested using a subject-rated video streaming QoE database.	algorithm;digital video;encode;elegant degradation;information security indicators;interaction;streaming media	Zhengfang Duanmu;Abdul Rehman;Kai Zeng;Zhou Wang	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)	10.1109/ICME.2016.7552859	simulation;telecommunications;computer science;machine learning;predictive modelling;multimedia;computational model	Visualization	-9.224654036827037	100.57856445204075	76928

The control over wide area network access and coverage has been a major reason for retaining customers. However, in recent years, new players are emerging in the telecommunications market which, either by aggregation or individually, offer an alternative to roaming customers, often at a lower price and higher bandwidth, compared to the mobile wide area access network by using low-cost, unlicensed and limited mobility access networks such as WLANs, also know as hotspots. Recently, long tail phenomenon, or the pattern of large number of smaller items or value has generated considerable interest especially in the online digital content retail market and industry.

New wireless communications engineering approaches and value-added services could lead to great benefits, improving situational awareness and enhancing life-saving capabilities. For these reasons, governments and organizations involved in public safety and security (PSS) are devoting great interest in the transition from existing narrowband wireless systems toward broadband. For this purpose, a viable solution is to adapt the new LTE-A technology in order to provide IP-based broadband services with security and reliability characteristics typical of PSS networks. However, the migration of these systems to LTE-A is currently a critical issue. Costs, timing, and spectrum availability for the deployment of a PSS-dedicated network are demanding. In addition, providing mission-critical services on an LTE-based PSS system needs a proper network architecture solution in order to achieve and maintain required performance and reliability levels. To fully accomplish this task, research efforts can result in significant improvements and adjustments of future releases of the LTE-A standard. This article focuses on critical issues that impact PSS communications evolution toward new technologies and describes the related possible steps, starting from the exploitation of the already deployed LTE-A commercial networks up to a fully PSS-dedicated network infrastructure. Finally, advanced solutions are described and critically discussed.	compaq lte;mission critical;network architecture;physical symbol system;software deployment	Romano Fantacci;Francesco Gei;Dania Marabissi;Luigia Micciullo	2016	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2016.7452262	quality of service;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;mobile computing;computer security;computer network;broadband networks	Metrics	-17.704098827657887	91.83970812084583	77273

We offer the first formalization of cheating in online games and propose an initial set of strong solutions. We propose a protocol that has provable anti-cheating guarantees, but suffers a performance penalty. We then develop an extended version of this protocol, called asynchronous synchronization, which avoids the penalty, is serverless, offers provable anti-cheating guarantees, is robust in the face of packet loss, and provides for significantly increased communication performance. This technique is applicable to common game features as well as clustering and cell-based techniques for massively multiplayer games. Our performance claims are backed by analysis using a simulation based on real game traces.	centralized computing;client–server model;cluster analysis;lockstep (computing);lockstep protocol;network packet;peer-to-peer;playout;provable security;real-time computing;real-time transcription;requirement;server (computing);simulation;speculative execution;tracing (software)	Nathaniel E.

A cross-layer algorithm, including the application (APP) layer, the media access control (MAC) layer and the physical (PHY) layer, is presented. More especially, a compressed method is proposed to estimate the video quality contribution caused by each packet in the APP. The objective is to maximising video qualities by satisfying the delay constraint and the fairness among all users. The algorithm is compatible with the emerging wireless standards, such as IEEE 802.16 and high speed downlink packet access (HSDPA). Simulations show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the conventional scheduling schemes in terms of received video qualities as well as the fairness properties.	access control;algorithm;fairness measure;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;multi-user;network packet;phy (chip);scheduling (computing);telecommunications link	Feng Li;G.

2ba32adce0d1d08d49a4e9a31f5451f450a837bd	impact of packet sampling on anomaly detection metrics	anomaly detection;packet sampling;sampling;network traffic analysis;empirical evaluation	Packet sampling methods such as Cisco's NetFlow are widely employed by large networks to reduce the amount of traffic data measured. A key problem with packet sampling is that it is inherently a lossy process, discarding (potentially useful) information. In this paper, we empirically evaluate the impact of sampling on anomaly detection metrics. Starting with unsampled flow records collected during the Blaster worm outbreak, we reconstruct the underlying packet trace and simulate packet sampling at increasing rates. We then use our knowledge of the Blaster anomaly to build a baseline of normal traffic (without Blaster), against which we can measure the anomaly size at various sampling rates. This approach allows us to evaluate the impact of packet sampling on anomaly detection without being restricted to (or biased by) a particular anomaly detection method.We find that packet sampling does not disturb the anomaly size when measured in volume metrics such as the number of bytes and number of packets, but grossly biases the number of flows. However, we find that recently proposed entropy-based summarizations of packet and flow counts are affected less by sampling, and expose the Blaster worm outbreak even at higher sampling rates. Our findings suggest that entropy summarizations are more resilient to sampling than volume metrics. Thus, while not perfect, sampling still preserves sufficient distributional structure, which when harnessed by tools like entropy, can expose hard-to-detect scanning anomalies.	anomaly detection;baseline (configuration management);boson sampling;byte;lossy compression;network packet;rényi entropy;sampling (signal processing);simulation	Daniela Brauckhoff;Bernhard Tellenbach;Arno Wagner;Martin May;Anukool Lakhina	2006		10.1145/1177080.1177101	sampling;anomaly detection;telecommunications;computer science;machine learning;mathematics;computer security;statistics	Metrics	-6.246840347039078	89.8912322532114	77976

This paper presents and deploys the Access Point Queue (APQ) methodology for externally estimating the queue capacity for a wireless AP. APQ determines the AP saturation point, measures the baseline delay, induces the saturation rate to measure the delay with a full AP queue and computes the queue capacity. APQ is deployed to determine the queue capacities of three commercial class and four residential class APs. The wireless AP queue capacities are shown to be packet-based and to range from 50 packets to over 350 packets. The fact that queue capacities vary so much among devices targeted for the same network configuration suggests future work to determine the most appropriate queue capacity.	ap computer science;bandwidth management;baseline (configuration management);dbpedia;design rationale;downstream (software development);network congestion;network packet;pc game;quality of service;queue (abstract data type);queuing delay;server (computing);simulation;wireless access point	Feng Li;Mingzhe Li;Rui Lu;Huahui Wu;Mark Claypool;Robert E.

However, a gap exists between the zero-loss-tolerance of the existing compression schemes and the lossy network transmissions. In this article, we propose a generic 3D middleware between the 3D application layer and the transport layer for the transmission of triangle-based progressively compressed 3D models. Significant features of the proposed middleware include. 1) handling 3D compressed data streams from multiple progressive compression techniques. 2) considering end user hardware capabilities for effectively saving the data size for network delivery. 3) a minimum cost dynamic reliable set selector to choose the transport protocol for each sublayer based on the real-time network traffic. Extensive simulations with TCP/UDP and SCTP show that the proposed 3D middleware can achieve the dual objectives of maintaining low transmission delay and small distortion, and thus supporting high quality 3D streaming with high flexibility.	3d computer graphics;3d modeling;data compression;display resolution;distortion;lossy compression;middleware;network packet;progressive meshes;real-time clock;real-time computing;simulation;virtual reality	Hui Li;Ming Li;B.

None of the copper-based wireline access technologies will be able to cope with this demand in the long term. Also wireless networks see similar growth and require higher and higher backhaul speeds. There is industry-wide consensus that only fiber-based access networks will be able to support this growth. It can be expected that the new generation of passive infrastructure will experience the same lifetime as today's copper-based infrastructure. Therefore, it is of vital importance that this infrastructure will be built in a way that it is as flexible as possible, supporting future applications and technologies without costly upgrades, while still being affordable at the time of deployment.	access network;backhaul (telecommunications);clock synchronization;fiber to the x;next-generation access;point-to-point construction;requirement;scalability;software deployment;synergy	Wolfgang Fischer	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-30376-0_20	telecommunications;computer security	Mobile	-18.258182681679404	95.09504065977339	78512

It enables provision of resource demanding real-time services and multimedia communication raising new end-to-end Quality-of-Service (QoS) challenges, for which quality adaptation using resource management is proposed as a solution in this paper. This is an integrated solution taking both IMS and computer access networks into account as well as the two end-devices and the application servers (AS) involved in communication. The best user experience is targeted under real-time variation of available network (e.g. bandwidth, buffer space) and end-device (e.g. battery, CPU, memory, storage) resources throughout a session. The multimedia content is dynamically adapted to fit the resource availability variations, achieving maximum system (i.e. network and end-devices) resource utilization and enhanced QoS. The resource availability update signalling is carried over Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) during the session.

Differences in transmission characteristics can be observed not only between various cloud gaming platforms, but also between different games played on the same platform. As the differences between games on the same platform can be very high (up to several Mbit/s), we can witness significant impacts on game performance and consequently the end user Quality of Experience. In this paper, we present a first step in the attempt to quantify this phenomenon through measurements of 18 games which differ in type, perspective, and input characteristics running on an open source cloud gaming platform- GamingAnywhere. We analyse gathered video samples and calculate the values of spatial and temporal video metrics defined in the literature. We identify the relation between two sets of video metrics and compare them with the network traffic characteristics, primarily bandwidth usage and packet rate. We also annotate and analyse the impact of user input and the context of the game on the application level.	cloud computing;cloud gaming;megabit;network packet;network traffic control;open-source software;requirement	Mirko Suznjevic;Justus Beyer;Lea Skorin-Kapov;Sebastian Möller;Nikola Sorsa	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo Workshops (ICMEW)	10.1109/ICMEW.2014.6890690	games;simulation;computer science;operating system;multimedia;world wide web;bandwidth;server;statistics	Metrics	-9.884678232783921	98.62055500680958	78716

While online games perform well under many network conditions, Internet delays can often degrade online game performance. The precise impact that latency has on online gameplay depends upon the game type and the actions within the game. While the effects of latency on specific games has been studied, knowledge about the effects of latency on classes of games and about the effects of latency on different player actions is lacking. This paper presents a broad, perspective-based classification of games based on player control and camera view. The foundation of the game classification are player actions, each of which is defined by its precision and deadline requirements. Experiments with controlled amount of precision, deadline and latency support the classification. This classification of games should prove useful for game designers, network engineers and game players themselves as they build and play on tomorrow's networks.	experiment;interrupt latency;requirement;video game developer	Mark Claypool;Kajal T.

dbff6e2d64a7bfcf8868809232e570883438e128	local area networks: an introduction	local area network;token ring;local network;ethernet;standardisation;computer networks	The term `local networku0027 first began to appear in print as long as ten years ago. In the second half of the 1970s there was a great deal of interest in techniques for implementing this type of network, namely to link together computers over a restricted area at low cost and at high data rates. It is now becoming apparent that two local network architectures in particular will become internationally the most prominent: these are the Ethernet and the token ring, both backed by US and European standards bodies and by competing and large industrial interests. A token bus is also being adopted for standardisation but seems likely to be in a somewhat secondary role. In the UK the Cambridge Ring, a slotted ring architecture, has made its own impact, but its future appears limited in a wider context.

We present a mobile ready-to-use streaming system, that encodes video using h264 codec (offering good quality and frame rate at very low bit-rates) and streams it over the network using UDP protocol. A dynamic frame rate control has been implemented in order to obtain the best trade off between playback fluency and latency.	codec;frame rate control;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;streaming media	Giovanni Gualdi;Andrea Prati;Rita Cucchiara	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-77088-6_25	real-time computing;computer science;video tracking;multimedia;video processing;computer network	Mobile	-8.187745586297018	100.0255380520522	79286

While this model offers significant scaling advantages over the signaling-oriented approach of Integrated Services, the management of a differentiated services network remains a complex problem. Since the operation of a differentiated network involves numerous access routers, core routers and servers, a consistent operation is difficult to achieve by independently configuring each device. In this paper, we explore a scheme to enable a network administrator to manage and configure DiffServ networks from a central location and also abstract away the specific details of device configuration, and allow him/her to express the management of the network in terms of application-oriented performance metrics. This leads to a simplification of network management task, which can be exploited to support business needs of an enterprise network, such as honoring Service Level Agreements provided to its customers.	business requirements;differentiated services;high- and low-level;image scaling;integrated services;internet protocol suite;level of detail;network performance;quality of service;router (computing);server (computing);service-level agreement;text simplification	Dinesh C.

In this work, we examine some methods of extending the SLA offering across ISP boundaries. We introduce three policies to coordinate the end-to-end performance guarantee in multiple ISP networks: the least-effort, the most-effort, and the equal-distribution policies. These policies refer to different manners in which the service-level constraints are distributed among all transit networks. We study the impacts of these policies on the overall ISP community when SLA is required. We evaluate the effectiveness of these policies in terms of both the network performance and the ISPs monetary profit. The results show that the policy choice depends on the network load, as well as the ISP cost structure.	end-to-end principle;service-level agreement	Panita Pongpaibool;Hyong S.

With fresh demand for new services and applications, it is becoming essential that wireless network architecture seamlessly interoperate with new and existing technologies, protocols and standards. This paper presents recent work on the use of hybrid wireless network infrastructures for delivering tele-education and e-learning applications to remote communities by combining a variety of satellite, terrestrial and wireless technologies, and provides the results from live scenarios carried out employing various methods of interoperability testing. The analysis of the results examines a number of different issues such as delay, jitter, packet loss, latency, throughput measurement, and bandwidth. By combining satellite and terrestrial (wireless) technologies, full coverage and high capacity can be achieved for true broadband services for delivering educational content. The interoperability among such diverse networks imposes a number of challenges regarding service provision and management.	bandwidth (signal processing);communications satellite;educational entertainment;interoperability;network architecture;network packet;packet delay variation;telecommunications network;terrestrial television;throughput	Munir Abbasi;Lampros K.

Solving the problem plays a key role in the successful delivery of cloud services since secure network performance is a fundamental consideration in cloud computing design that is associated with service level agreement (SLA) An SLA is a contract agreed on between a customer and a network service provider. It defines the quality of service (QoS) that the network service provider promises to offer and a fee that the customer agrees to pay for its services. A network service provider uses a set of network resources to support cloud service applications subject to an SLA. The QoS in this paper includes percentile response time, network utilization, and vulnerability. This paper gives an approach for network bandwidth optimization or provisioning in such an environment that minimizes the total cost of network bandwidth used by a network service provider for a cloud service application while satisfying a QoS and a fee negotiated between a customer and the network service provider. We finally present resulting algorithms and demonstrate the applicability of the algorithms through simulation experiments.	algorithm;cloud computing;computer security;experiment;mathematical optimization;network model;network performance;network service provider;optimization problem;provisioning;quality of service;response time (technology);service-level agreement;simulation;vulnerability (computing)	Kaiqi Xiong	2015	2015 IEEE 12th Intl Conf on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing and 2015 IEEE 12th Intl Conf on Autonomic and Trusted Computing and 2015 IEEE 15th Intl Conf on Scalable Computing and Communications and Its Associated Workshops (UIC-ATC-ScalCom)	10.1109/UIC-ATC-ScalCom-CBDCom-IoP.2015.95	panorama9;bandwidth throttling;best-effort delivery;service level requirement;provider edge;service level objective;network intelligence;network traffic control;mobile qos;quality of service;cloud computing;application service provider;business service provider;computer science;information security;service delivery framework;value-added network;operating system;utility computing;data as a service;customer service assurance;world wide web;computer security;provisioning;bandwidth;server;measurement;computer network	Networks	-8.981184517989115	94.95121138402027	79817

Furthermore, a hybrid scheme is proposed to handle macro-mobility (mobile IP for non-real-time services and SIP for real-time services). The internetworking between micromobility and macro-mobility is implemented at an entity called the enhanced mobility gateway. Both qualitative and quantitative results have demonstrated that the performance of the proposed mobility management is better than existing schemes. Furthermore, a context transfer solution for AAA is proposed to enhance the multilayer mobility management scheme by avoiding the additional delay introduced by AAA security procedures.	aaa (video game industry);internet protocol suite	Christos Politis;Kar Ann Chew;Nadeem Akhtar;Michael Georgiades;Rahim Tafazolli;Tasos Dagiuklas	2004	IEEE Wireless Commun.	10.1109/MWC.2004.1325894	telecommunications;computer science;mobility model;computer security;transport layer;mobile ip;computer network	Visualization	-12.057677309847572	90.39936249767598	80095

Since the content for channels, other than the one currently viewed, is not readily available at the client side, to receive the content corresponding to these channels, each request needs to go through the network, leading to significant, and oftentimes unacceptable, delays. To minimize this latency, various approaches have been proposed. These approaches typically require the use of dedicated servers near the access network to speed up the delivery of channel change packets. In this paper, we use such server-driven framework to develop a joint unicast- and multicast-based channel change protocol that relies on the use of (i) session-dependent multicast channel change streams to deliver the key-frame content to the zapping clients, and (ii) a dedicated unicast streaming server, which is referred to as the Channel Switch Coordinator (CSC), to deliver the channel change packets corresponding to the non-key-frames. In our framework, CSC server is also responsible for coordinating the received channel change requests and optimally allocating system resources for each received request.	access network;client-side;dedicated hosting service;iptv;key frame;multicast;server (computing);streaming media;unicast	Aytac Azgin;Yücel Altunbasak	2012	2012 IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference (CCNC)	10.1109/CCNC.2012.6181157	availability;real-time computing;multicast;ip multicast;telecommunications;network switch;protocol independent multicast;computer science;resource management;operating system;pragmatic general multicast;source-specific multicast;bandwidth;xcast;server;statistics;computer network;unicast;access network	Mobile	-8.17195672792967	96.5778483837794	80578

In today's crowdsourced streaming systems, numerous broadcasters lively stream their video content, e.g., live events or online game scenes, to fellow viewers. Compared to professional video producers and broadcasters, these new generation broadcasters are geo-distributed globally and highly heterogeneous in terms of the generated video quality and the network/system configurations. The scalability and heterogeneity challenges therefore lie on both broadcasters and the viewers, which call for massive transcoding, and two critical issues: 1) choosing video representation set that maximizes viewer satisfaction and 2) allocating computational resources that minimize operational costs, must be systematically optimized in the global scale. In this paper, we present a generic framework utilizing the powerful and elastic cloud computing services for crowdsourced live streaming with heterogeneous broadcasters and viewers. We jointly consider the viewer satisfaction and the service availability/pricing of geo-distributed cloud resources for transcoding. We develop an optimal scheduler for allocating cloud instances with no regional constraints. We then extend the solution to accommodate regional constraints, and discuss a series of practical enhancements, including popularity forecasting, initialization latency, and viewer feedbacks. Our solutions have been evaluated under diverse networks and cloud system configurations as well as parameter settings. The trace-driven simulation confirms the superiority of our design, while our Planetlab-based experiment offers further practical hints toward real-world migration.	cloud computing;computational resource;crowdsourcing;digital video;feedback;lively kernel;personal computer;planetlab;scalability;scheduling (computing);simulation;streaming media	Qiyun He;Jiangchuan Liu;Chonggang Wang;Bo Li	2016	IEEE Transactions on Multimedia	10.1109/TMM.2016.2544698	games;transcoding;cloud computing;computer science;operating system;multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web;server;computer network	OS	-9.20277325922288	98.6220363851919	80655

But the unfortunate state of affairs is that applications need to use several different application programming interfaces (APIs) and to design protocols on how and when to use a specific communication network(s). This is troublesome, error-prone and APIs vary a lot; applications want to use just one API but get the benefit of several communications networks. In this paper we detail, implement and test in real field tests a virtual network system (VNS). We argue why messaging applications should use and benefit from VNS. The VNS is a middleware solution that enables seamless usage of different networks. Netlink Next Generation (NLNG) protocol is a practical implementation of VNS and we elaborate on it's features, design choices and problems faced. The NLNG protocol has its origins in the Linux Netlink and VNS concept is a middleware, thus we provide a comparison between these previous works and our work. The VNS system and NLNG protocol have already been tested with several applications, e.g., mail clients, tracking and command softwares, and network interfaces, e.g., IP, VHF, HF, GSM SMS and TETRA SDS.	application programming interface;baseline (configuration management);cognitive dimensions of notations;internet protocol suite;linux;middleware;next-generation network;seamless3d;telecommunications network	Juho Määttä;Risto Järvinen;Riku Luostarinen;Lauri Liuhto;Taneli Taira;Jukka Manner	2011	2011 - MILCOM 2011 Military Communications Conference	10.1109/MILCOM.2011.6127528	embedded system;real-time computing;computer science;operating system	Mobile	-19.188621911804322	89.77112237538778	80781

As such paths become common in the Internet, TCP's inefficiency will be the main bottleneck in deploying high-rate, low-latency communications services such as tele-presence, free-viewpoint video or virtual reality. In this paper, we present PRRT -Predictably Reliable Real-time Transport, a protocol layer that efficiently supports these services. PRRT is based on a hybrid error correction that combines proactive and reactive reliability and dynamically adjusts the amount of redundancy to path properties. By relying on an analytical model of the path, it achieves a near-optimal packet-erasure correction under service-specific end-to-end delay. As a result, it simultaneously achieves a low latency and a high bandwidth utilization. We describe key features of the PRRT: (1) adaptive block-erasure coding and (2) predictable reliability based on a statistical performance model. We implement PRRT in the Linux kernel and evaluate its performance over a range of large bandwidth-delay product paths under a strict service-specific delay.	bandwidth-delay product;error detection and correction	Manuel Gorius;Goran Petrovic;Thorsten Herfet	2012	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2012.07.003	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Networks	-6.392481122716206	98.44649730987415	80925

Indeed, cellular telephony, radio paging, cellular data, and even cellular multimedia services have become commonplace and the demand for enhanced capabilities will continue to grow into the foreseeable future. It is anticipated that in the not-so-distant future, mobile users will be able to access their data and other services such as electronic mail, video telephony, stock market news, map services, electronic banking, while on the move. As mobile and wireless networks are being called upon to support real-time interactive multimedia traffic, such as video tele-conferencing, these networks must be able to provide their users with Qualityof-Service (QoS) guarantees. Although the QoS provisioning problem arises in wireline networks as well, mobility of hosts, scarcity of bandwidth, and channel fading make QoS provisioning a challenging task in mobile and wireless networks. Recently it was noticed that multimedia applications can tolerate and gracefully adapt to transient fluctuations in the QoS that they receive from the network. The management of such adaptive multimedia applications is becoming a new research area in wireless networks. As it turns out, the additional flexibility afforded by the ability of multimedia applications to tolerate and adapt to transient changes in the QoS parameters can be exploited by protocol designers to significantly improve the overall performance of wireless systems. The minitrack focuses on fundamental challenges and issues arising in the process of QoS provisioning in mobile and wireless networks, including cellular, ad-hoc, satellite, and IP-based networks. Our principle goal was to bring together leading researchers in this booming field of research in order to identify the fundamental challenges and future perspectives of this important area. Indeed, it has been noticed that wireless communications and mobile computing are redefining computing as a discipline. The impact is expected to be profound and lasting, ranging from educational, to medical, to military, to industrial, and to societal. We felt that it was very important to capture the state of the art and to identify the important trends in this new and exciting area or research. A minitrack on the same topic was run successfully within HICSS’37. The attendants and participants have urged us to continue the effort for HICSS’38. The result is a collection of eleven outstanding papers dealing with many aspects of QoS provisioning in mobile and wireless networks. Indeed, the minitrack brings together leading researchers in this booming field and identifies fundamental challenges and future perspectives of this important area. We want to take this opportunity to thank a number of folks that made this minitrack possible. First, we thank the authors of the papers for considering our minitrack as an outlet for their work. Next, we extend our thanks to the referees whose dedicated work and constructive comments allowed us to present a high-quality product. Last, but certainly not least, our thanks go to Professor Gul Agha for his encouragement and support and to the indefatigable Eileen Dennis for her patience in working with us.	quality of service	Stephan Olariu;Andreas Kassler	2005		10.1109/HICSS.2005.430	multi-frequency network;mobile qos;telecommunications;computer science;artificial intelligence;marketing;operating system;wireless network;software engineering;database;mobile computing;management;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-17.864170163280008	95.93265249633187	80956

Unfortunately, TCP does not perform well in such fast-changing environments, potentially leading to poor spectrum utilization and high end-to-end packet delay.  In this paper we revisit seminal work in cross-layer optimization in the context of 4G cellular networks. Specifically, we leverage the rich physical layer information exchanged between base stations (NodeB) and mobile phones (UE) to predict the capacity of the underlying cellular link, and propose nCQIC, a cross-layer congestion control design. Experiments on real cellular networks confirm that our capacity estimation method is both accurate and precise. A CQIC sender uses these capacity estimates to adjust its packet sending behavior. Our preliminary evaluation reveals that CQIC improves throughput over TCP by 1.08-2.89x for small and medium flows. For large flows, CQIC attains throughput comparable to TCP while reducing the average RTT by 2.38-2.65x.	end-to-end principle;mathematical optimization;mobile phone;network congestion;network packet;smartphone;software propagation;throughput	Feng Lu;Hao Du;Ankur Jain;Geoffrey M.

To maintain service continuity and guarantee the QoS in real-time applications for mobile users, handover delay is one of the main challenges. In this paper, cross layer trigger-based handover scheme is proposed which will be able to offer uninterrupted services to mobile users. The basic idea behind this scheme is to achieve a global optimality by utilising the advantages of cross layer interactions between link layer and network layer. The cross layer triggers generated at lower layers, intimate higher layers about an imminent handover and allow execution of handover processes in layer 2 and layer 3 simultaneously. The analytical and simulation results show that the proposed mechanism enhances the handover performance in terms of handover delay and latency, which, in turn, reduces signalling overload and service disruption significantly.

This article presents an overview of various features of BWA systems toward realizing a high level of scalability to support a potentially fast expanding network. This is achieved by optimizing various network resources, which include utilizing the available bandwidth efficiency, making a minor enhancement to an existing system that minimizes the disruption to network services during the network expansion process, and combining the benefits of different features to increase network capacity.	access network;areal density (computer storage);denial-of-service attack;high-level programming language;list of sequence alignment software;multipoint ground;network architecture;scalability;software deployment;spectral efficiency;systems architecture	Bernard Fong;Nirwan Ansari;Alvis Cheuk M.

Currently, each network layer (including physical layer, media access control (MAC), transport, and application layers) provides a separate solution to these challenges by providing its own optimized adaptation and protection mechanisms. However, this layered strategy does not always result in an optimal overall performance for the transmission of video. Moreover, certain protection strategies can be implemented simultaneously in several layers and, hence, the optimal choices from the application and complexity perspective need to be identified. In this paper, we evaluate different error control and adaptation mechanisms available in the different layers for robust transmission of video, namely MAC retransmission strategy, application-layer forward error correction, bandwidth-adaptive compression using scalable coding, and adaptive packetization strategies. Subsequently, we propose a novel adaptive cross-layer protection strategy for enhancing the robustness and efficiency of scalable video transmission by performing tradeoffs between throughput, reliability, and delay depending on the channel conditions and application requirements. The results obtained using the proposed adaptive cross-layer protection strategies show a significantly improved visual performance for the transmitted video over a variety of channel conditions.	access control;adaptive compression;channel (communications);distortion;end-to-end principle;error detection and correction;forward error correction;mathematical optimization;multipath propagation;network packet;network topology;programming computable functions;protection mechanism;protocol stack;requirement;retransmission (data networks);scalability;simple set;simulation;streaming media;system integration;telecommunications link;throughput;whole genome sequencing	Mihaela van der Schaar;Santhana Krishnamachari;Sunghyun Choi;Xiaofeng Xu	2003	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2003.815231	real-time computing;media access control;adaptive control;telecommunications;computer science;forward error correction;physical layer;visual communication;computer network	Mobile	-6.00106668697118	101.90050163441937	81210

We discuss the utilization of these techniques across interdomain boundaries in the global Internet. We first analyze the characteristics of interdomain traffic on the basis of measurements from three different Internet Service Providers and show that a small number of sources are responsible for a large fraction of the traffic. Across interdomain boundaries, traffic engineering relies on a careful tuning of the route advertisements sent via the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). We explain how this tuning can be used to control the flow of the incoming and of the outgoing traffic and identify its limitations.	border gateway protocol;inter-domain;internet	Bruno Quoitin;Cristel Pelsser;L.

This issue of the Bell Labs Technical Journal will treat many aspects relating to this opportunity. Three key ingredients for offering next-generation services are intelligent endpoints, network servers capable of providing such services, and flexible transport amenable to multiple traffic types. Easy programmability of the network servers can be critical: “killer apps” are elusive and trial and error with rapid turnover of services and service variants is expected. Supporting an application programming interface (API) may not be sufficiently useful for customers; Lucent Technologies' Full Circle™ program, discussed in this issue, includes various additional forms of support. Equipping the network servers with a set of base capabilities is also needed to give multimedia support, a unified look and feel for multiple service add-ons, and acceptable operations and maintenance. A variety of technologies are being used to support next-generation service capabilities. These include portal technology for adapting to a range of endpoint capabilities, policy management, object-oriented technologies (for example, frameworks and components), protocols and meta-protocols such as Extensible Markup Language (XML), and Internet-related technologies (for example, browser and language technologies).	application programming interface;communication endpoint;killer application;language technology;look and feel;markup language;server (computing);xml	Douglas C.

However, even in research terms MANEMO is in a very early stage of development and consequently no standardised understanding of what MANEMO specifically refers to has yet been decided upon. In this paper we introduce the MANEMO concept as a whole and identify what we believe to be the two main solution areas contained in the MANEMO problem domain, namely NEMO-centric MANEMO (NCM) and MANET-centric MANEMO (MCM). In addition to defining these two instances of MANEMO we also highlight the design decisions and implementation considerations that are encountered when developing an NCM protocol through the introduction of our NCM protocol implementation that we are currently producing at Lancaster University	multi-chip module;problem domain	Ben McCarthy;Christopher Edwards;Martin Dunmore	2007	2007 International Symposium on Applications and the Internet Workshops	10.1109/SAINT-W.2007.20	wireless ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;transport layer;standardization;computer network	Arch	-18.685953963373837	91.55395765478842	81822

The service proxy is always colocated with the mobile user's location database such that whenever the MU's location database moves during a location handoff, a service handoff also ensues to colocate the service proxy with the location database. This allows the proxy to know the location of the mobile user all the time to reduce the network communication cost for service delivery. We investigate four integrated location and service management schemes. Our results show that the centralized scheme performs the best when the mobile user's SMR (service to mobility ratio) is low and CMR (call to mobility ratio) is high, while the fully distributed scheme performs the best when both SMR and CMR are high. In all other conditions, the dynamic anchor scheme is the best except when the service context transfer cost is high, under which the static anchor scheme performs the best. Through analytical and simulation results, we demonstrate that different users with vastly different mobility and service patterns should adopt different integrated location and service management methods to optimize system performance. Further, the best integrated scheme always performs better than the best decoupled scheme that considers location and service managements separately and management schemes that do not use any service proxy	application server;best practice;centralized computing;client–server model;colocation centre;database;itil;microsoft research;operating system service management;personalization;petri net;proxy server;server (computing);shingled magnetic recording;simulation;user profile	Ing-Ray Chen;Baoshan Gu;Sheng-Tzong Cheng	2006	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2006.23	service level requirement;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;computer performance;world wide web;computer security;client–server model;computer network	Mobile	-19.84489534961316	99.25963989017791	81850

Please refer to the current edition of the """"Internet Official Protocol Standards"""" (STD 1) for the standardization state and status of this protocol. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. Abstract This document specifies a procedure that deals with a particular issue that may arise when a Service Provider (SP) provides """"BGP/MPLS IP VPN"""" service to a customer and the customer uses OSPFv2 to advertise its routes to the SP. In this situation, a Customer Edge (CE) Router and a Provider Edge (PE) Router are OSPF peers, and customer routes are sent via OSPFv2 from the CE to the PE. The customer routes are converted into BGP routes, and BGP carries them across the backbone to other PE routers. The routes are then converted back to OSPF routes sent via OSPF to other CE routers. As a result of this conversion, some of the information needed to prevent loops may be lost. A procedure is needed to ensure that once a route is sent from a PE to a CE, the route will be ignored by any PE that receives it back from a CE. This document specifies the necessary procedure, using one of the options bits in the LSA (Link State Advertisements) to indicate that an LSA has already been forwarded by a PE and should be ignored by any other PEs that see it."""	border gateway protocol;customer edge;internet backbone;link-state routing protocol;multiprotocol label switching;provider edge;router (computing);std bus;virtual private network	Eric C.

c3fa019bb286c357dde900f3b3ef22683cc903f2	performance evaluation of scalable video stream over bandwidth constrained network using software defined networks		Scalable Video Coding is one of the layered video coding method, which codes the video into different temporal, spatial and quality scalability levels. It allows partial removal of the scalable video levels to provide good QoE/QoS in a resource constrained environment. In a heterogeneous environment of devices and network technology, resources vary from device to device and one technology to another. In such cases, scalable video coding is suitable to streaming as it improves user satisfaction. Network bandwidth is one such parameter, which has a higher impact on the video quality that is streamed between the media server and a receiving device. This paper simulates video streaming over bandwidth constrained network to study the performance of video on bandwidth variations. Here, network with different topologies and bandwidth are created using Mininet tool and Scalable video levels generated using JSVM are streamed and recorded using VLC. Later, the video is compared with the origin one to verify the objective video quality at receivers.	bitstream;code;data compression;media server;performance evaluation;quality of service;scalability;scalable video coding;server (computing);software-defined networking;streaming media;vlc media player	Royce Fernandes;M.

Special stress has been put in the South Asian region through some comparative analysis. Proving their competency in numerous aspects, WiMAX and LTE already have already made a strong position in telecommunication industry. Both WiMAX and LTE are 4G technologies designed to move data rather than voice having IP networks based on OFDM technology. So, they aren’t like typical technological rivals as of GSM and CDMA. But still a gesture of hostility seems to outburst long before the stable commercial launch of LTE. In this paper various aspects of WiMAX and LTE for deployment have been analyzed. Again, we tried to make every possible consideration with respect to south Asia i.e. how mass people of this region may be benefited. As a result, it might be regarded as a good source in case of making major BWA deployment decisions in this region. Besides these, it also opens the path for further research and in depth thinking in this issue.

This paper presents a new mechanism for name resolution, which relies on existing naming mechanisms. In particular the focus is on the scalability of the solution from signaling load and latency point of view.	ambient network;gunning transceiver logic;image resolution;name binding;noise reduction;point of view (computer hardware company);scalability	Pekka Pääkkönen;Nadeem Akhtar;Rui Campos;Cornelia Kappler;Petteri Pöyhönen;Di Zhou	2006		10.1007/11750390_15	local area network;ambient calculus;scalability;the internet;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;wireless network;personal area network;mobile computing;computer security;standardization;computer network	Mobile	-14.052180268804529	96.21062079083909	82008

Most of the current solutions for the interworking of networks, which generally rely on the physical layer handover between different networks such as mobile cellular or broadcast networks, does not necessarily considers the application level issues such as service continuation or associated services. Handover association table based approach can easily be used for solving service continuation problems. In this paper we look at the framework which not only allows for seamless service continuation between heterogeneous networks but can also be extended to accumulate further service provisioning.

It also uses a message-based protocol to improve communications reliability. Adaptation mechanisms are introduced and validated using a healthcare application.

The project, which will last three years, has the ambitious goal of developing an innovative approach, TMN-compatible but specifically tailored on the needs of optics, thereby applicable to any generic-and advanced-optical technology. This innovative approach is based, however, on standardised methodologies and models, to ensure continuity with existing networks and network management. This paper aims at describing the work undertaken in the MEPHISTO project, of which brief description is provided. It defines, in cooperation with operators (FT/CNET, Telecom Italia, Telenor), manufacturers (Alcatel, Nokia), software houses (Tells Telecom, Telmat) and universities (IMEC, UPC), the requirements and specifications of the management of an optical network and the optical network elements. The layered model of the optical transport network and the information models are provided. We will focus on the development of a dedicated information model for generic optical network elements, adopting an innovative approach for optical network operation and management, and on the prototypes used to demonstrate the applicability of this model and the validation of the developed management applications.

The EU project MEDIEVAL (MultimEDia transport for mobIlE Video AppLications) [1] aims at filling this gap. In this paper we describe the approaches envisioned by the project for what concerns the data link layer, with special emphasis on wireless access and its related cross-layer issues.

Much of the variation is independent of cache size and network topology and thus appears to be related to differences in the user communities. Analysis of a range of user traces shows that, just like caches, individual users have highly variable hit rates, Zipf locality curves and show strong signs of long range dependency. In order to predict cache performance we propose a simple model which treats a cache as an aggregation of single users, and each user as a small cache.	cpu cache;hypertext transfer protocol;locality of reference;multi-user;network topology;server (computing);tracing (software);zipf's law	Ian W.

For scalable video streaming applications, the conventional solution to reduced throughput due to channel distortions is to reduce the video bitrate by dropping the higher enhancement layers of the scalable video. We show that video quality can be improved, without adding to traffic load, when the WLAN link adaptation scheme uses a temporal fairness criterion along with scalable video distortion estimates to adjust its physical (PHY) layer modulation and coding parameters used for delivering each video layer. We formulate the problem as an optimization problem for assigning different PHY modes to different layers of scalable video under temporal fairness constrains; the solution to this problem provides a set of PHY configuration parameters that achieve the highest possible video quality while meeting the admission control constraints. Performance evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and the accuracy of the models.	distortion;fairness measure;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;mathematical optimization;modulation;network packet;optimization problem;phy (chip);peak signal-to-noise ratio;scalability;scalable video coding;simulation;streaming media;throughput	Yaser P.

They have introduced Bundling, an overlay network for delay tolerant networking in its architecture, which should be globally deployed and operated with tremendous effort. In this paper, we propose a new DTN architecture that are more practically and easily deployable in the Internet space. Our approach is IP over DTN; DTN message delivery framework works as a data link to deliver IP packets over network boundaries. The transport and application layer protocols take asynchronous communication mode in this architecture. We have carried out an experiment with our prototype DTN framework and confirmed that applications could practically communicate well with each other even with large-delay IP packet delivery.	delay-tolerant networking;end-to-end principle;hop-by-hop transport;ip (complexity);internet;network packet;overlay network;product bundling;prototype;whole earth 'lectronic link	Hideya Ochiai;Kenichi Shimotada;Hiroshi Esaki	2009	2009 International Conference on Ultra Modern Telecommunications & Workshops	10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345643	real-time computing;computer science;delay-tolerant networking;distributed computing;transport layer;computer network	Networks	-7.327936133544334	89.06205375452639	83398

The metrics that are relevant are available at the core of the radio link and the application or TCP layers have no knowledge of the wireless metrics. With a signaling protocol to the application/TCP layer and a prediction mechanism of the future link quality the applications will be able to avoid buffer overflows and/or congestion. In this paper we identify metrics that are suitable for application/TCP control, and analyze the performance of the prediction of the metrics. We show that the prediction of wireless metrics can be made with low error (3-10% MAPE) even with high cloud latency. This is a significant result as it states that predictions in the cloud of even short term LTE metrics are possible and that the predictions are fairly accurate to influence the proper operation of applications/TCP in wireless environments.	algorithm;buffer overflow;cloud analytics;cloud computing;compaq lte;concatenation;memory effect;network congestion;signaling protocol	Zulfiquar Sayeed;Qi Liao;David W.

d3588e896220e291f2c951361b32101f309c104f	image quality estimation in wireless multimedia sensor networks: an experimental study		Multimedia applications in wireless sensor networks (WMSN) have stringent quality of service (QoS) requirements. In this paper, we study image quality distortions due to packet losses in multi hop WMSN. An experimental simulation and real testbed environment has been setup to estimate the quality of the test images over 30,000 transmissions. Two scenarios are considered: in the first scenario, images are watermarked with their replicas at the source node and an error concealment (EC) algorithm is employed at the sink. In the second scenario, raw images are transmitted without any encoding. The empirical results have revealed that there is a strong correlation between Peak-SignalTo-Noise-Ratio (PSNR) values of the distorted images and packet loss rate of the transmission route (PER). Moreover, the relationship is linear when EC technique is used with an achievement over 25dB PSNR for PER less than 0.6. This correlation is useful when designing QoS based transport schemes.	algorithm;bit error rate;distortion;error concealment;image quality;linear function;multipath propagation;network packet;peak signal-to-noise ratio;quality of service;raw image format;requirement;simulation;testbed;watermark (data file)	Pinar Sarisaray Boluk;Kerem Irgan;Sebnem Baydere;A.

a490022a0033f21d44ebce4050f314ccd5e1e5cf	on the use of network coding as a virtual network function in satellite-terrestrial cdns		This paper describes network coding as a network function. It also discusses how network coding can be easily virtualized and integrated within latest generation architectures dealing with virtual network functions. Network coding actually introduces a new perspective in the field of network function virtualization since it departs from the traditional interpretation of virtual network functions as a generalization of functionality typically implemented in dedicated hardware. It rather refers to a novel network functionality that generalizes and extends classic packet-level end-to-end coding by enabling in-network optimized re-encoding of the transmitted data. This helps improve throughput gains, but can also prove fundamental in the provisioning of non-functional requirements like security and reliability. The paper also focuses on the application of the proposed virtual network coding function to a specific use case related to caching-aided multicast transmissions in hybrid satellite-terrestrial Content Delivery Networks.	content delivery network;download;esa;end-to-end principle;functional requirement;linear network coding;multicast;network function virtualization;network packet;non-functional requirement;provisioning;shine expert system;terrestrial television;throughput;transfer function	Simon Pietro Romano;Fabio Giangrande	2018	IEEE INFOCOM 2018 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)	10.1109/INFCOMW.2018.8406930	throughput;multicast;coding (social sciences);network functions virtualization;virtual network;linear network coding;computer network;provisioning;computer science;server	Networks	-10.996416805010641	93.53644684284419	83699

When users leave a GLR/VLR service area, deregistration with a GLR/VLR is required. Deregistration may create significant traffic in the network, especially the traffic between a GLR and a HLR, which is the remote/international traffic. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical implicit deregistration scheme with a first/subsequent registration in 3G cellular networks to effectively eliminate deregistration traffic. An analytic model is proposed to carry out the performance of the proposed scheme. Our study shows that the proposed scheme not only reduces the local deregistration traffic between the GLR and the VLR, but also reduces the remote/international deregistration traffic between the HLR and the GLR. This is especially true when the ratio of the cost of the remote/international traffic between the GLR and the HLR to the cost of local traffic between the VLR and the GLR is high.

In the algorithm, the packet is scheduled by the packet quality contribution index (PQCI). The PQCI is defined and estimated not only by the quality distortion made for the current frame, but also by that made for the frames which directly or indirectly related with the current frame. A dual-decoder-model algorithm is proposed for the PQCI estimation. A novel architecture with two simulated decoders in the sender is developed. The simulations show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the conventional methods in terms of received video qualities.	algorithm;distortion;end-to-end encryption;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;network packet;scheduling (computing);simulation;user experience	Danyang Zhang;Fan Li;Chao Zhang	2013	2013 9th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing	10.1109/ICICS.2013.6782913	fair-share scheduling;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;round-robin scheduling;scheduling;computer network	Mobile	-6.090049680368026	101.4721900292851	84104

Compared to 4G network, 5G network will support larger mobility as well as higher transmission rate, higher user experience rate, energy efficiency, spectrum efficiency and so forth. All of these will boost a variety of multimedia services, especially for Over-The-Top (OTT) services. So for, OTT services have already gained great popularity and contributed to large traffic consumption, which propose a challenge for operators. As OTT services are designed to deliver over the best effort Internet, the QoE management solutions for traditional multimedia services are obsolete, which propose new challenges in QOE management aspects for network and service providers, especially for the 4G and future 5G network. This paper attempts to present the technical challenges faced by 5G network from QoE management perspective of OTT services. Our objective is to enhance the user experience of OTT services and improve network efficiency. We analysis the characteristics and QoE factors of OTT services over 5G wireless network. With the QoE factors and current QoE management situation, we summarize OTT services QoE quantification and evaluation methods, present QoE-driven radio resource management and optimization solutions. Then, we propose a framework and whole evaluation procedure which aim at obtaining the accurate user experience value as well as improving network efficiency and optimizing the user experience.	algorithm;best-effort delivery;decision tree;machine learning;mathematical optimization;personalization;quality of service;quantization (signal processing);radio resource management;spectral efficiency;user experience	Feng-Hui Huang;Wenan Zhou;Yu Du	2014	2014 Ninth International Conference on Broadband and Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications	10.1109/BWCCA.2014.74	mobile telephony;telecommunications;network switch;computer science;resource management;operating system;5g;mathematical model;multimedia;bandwidth;computer network	Mobile	-10.530966239919964	99.86071068116907	84241

When transmitting compressed video across the Internet, however, one of the main challenges is packet error/loss. High coding dependencies among video frames suffer from vulnerability to packet loss, which impacts the playback quality of video streaming. Losing an frame importance may cause a set of frames loss or damage as well. In this paper, we propose an effective important frame decision scheme in which the playback quality is considered. The results of this paper can be applied to the unequal frame protection scheme which targets to improve the video playback quality with minimal frame protection overhead.	computer simulation;data compression;esoteric programming language;internet;network packet;next-generation network;overhead (computing);real-time transcription;streaming media;transmitter	Huan-Yao Kang;Ching-Lung Chang	2010	2010 International Conference on Broadband, Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications	10.1109/BWCCA.2010.124	inter frame;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;video tracking;multimedia;automatic repeat request;motion compensation;statistics;computer network	Embedded	-6.658629757309512	101.20699825104282	84360

Tertiary networks and telecommunications engineering students are required to learn all aspects about the Internet and Internet services. The open-source, research and teaching platform, Network Simulator (NS) was integrated with the open-source Joint Model (JM) H.264/AVC encoder-decoder to educate students about computer networks. On this integrated educational platform, videos can be encoded and encapsulated into network packets with modifications to JM encoder source code. These packets are sent across a NS simulated network with a simulated NS multicast server. NS multicast clients subscribe to NS multicast servers. Other network traffic can compete with the multicast packets and cause congestion. Traffic shaping, fairness and other networking techniques can be simulated with real video data. Packet loss in such an environment is inevitable. Multicast clients receive the video stream with some losses. Clients' data can be decoded using a modified JM decoder. Lost data can be concealed using error concealment techniques or reconstructed with losses. The integration of NS and JM is ideal to teach the next generation's network and telecommunications engineers, all aspects of network traffic including streaming media, streaming protocols, subscription, traffic congestion, traffic shaping and fairness. This paper describes the necessary modifications to JM and NS and gives examples of educational exercises and discussions.	encoder;error concealment;fairness measure;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;internet;multicast;network congestion;network packet;next-generation network;open-source software;server (computing);streaming media;television;traffic shaping;virtual reality;web service	Tony de Souza-Daw;Nguyen Tien Dzung;Thang Manh Hoang;Ngoc Hoang Le	2012	Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON)	10.1109/EDUCON.2012.6201021	real-time computing;computer science;world wide web;computer network	Networks	-7.81077284683755	101.77859294651383	84519

The framework considers the traditional IP network infrastructure, IPv6 based mobility support, multihoming, traffic flow transparent handovers and flat/dynamic mobility policy enforcement to guarantee the Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) with ubiquitous connectivity. Using Network Mobility (NEMO) we can provide a flexible network integration mechanism across WiFi, WiMax and UMTS systems vertically. The flexible approach overcomes the limitation of different networks access denial when nodes move using two operations: Policy enforced handover management and Dynamic handover implementation.

When a subscriber of a national MNO, referred to as Domestic service provider (DSP) in this context, travels abroad, that person should be entitled to receive voice, data, SMS and MMS from the ARP. Hereto, the end-user has to sign up with the ARP beforehand. Users shall also be entitled to use Local breakout (LBO) when traveling abroad. Data connection (mobile IP connectivity) may be obtained from the Visited mobile network operator (VMNO), through local GGSN / PDGw. Hereto, the end-user has to sign up with the local LBO operator. ARP and LBO present specific challenges for MNOs, but also opportunities for differentiation.

Mobility management has been a growing concern in IPv6 with numerous problems  originating from roaming between IPv6 and IPv4 access networks owing to ever-growing research. The various architectures concerning  transition / mobility among IPv6 and IPv4 are studied. The study reveals that only IPv6 initiated communications (from IPv6  based network) with IPv4 nodes (in IPv4 based network) are considered. The existing architectures in the study do not consider  the scenarios such as the IPv6 nodes visiting IPv4 network; IPv4 nodes visiting IPv6 network; IPv4 initiated communications  with other nodes irrespective of IP version of network. The newly proposed mobility management system for the integrated IPv4  and IPv6 networks is referred to as IMM-I46 and provides a detailed solution that can be implemented immediately. The proposed  IMM-I46 system helps IPv6 mobile users to roam freely also into IPv4 based networks besides roaming in IPv6 networks, get  serviced, connected with internet and vice versa.    		J.

The demand for interactivity, which significantly impacts user experience and provider revenue, is translated into stringent timing requirements for flows in datacenter networks. Thus low latency networking is becoming a major concern of both industry and academia. We provide a short survey of recent progress made by the networking community for low latency datacenter networks. We propose a taxonomy to categorize existing work based on four main techniques, reducing queue length, accelerating retransmissions, prioritizing mice flows, and exploiting multipath. Then we review select papers, highlight the principal ideas, and discuss their pros and cons. We also present our perspectives of the research challenges and opportunities, hoping to aspire more future work in this space.	apevia;best-effort delivery;big data;categorization;data center;data infrastructure;e-services;interactivity;international symposium on fundamentals of computation theory;interrupt latency;mouse flow;multipath propagation;network packet;queuing delay;requirement;taxonomy (general);user experience	Shuhao Liu;Hong Xu;Zhiping Cai	2013	CoRR		computer network;interactivity;user experience design;big data;latency (engineering);computer science;revenue;queue	Networks	-10.23270816832238	93.90520404319192	84821

We propose a research framework for large-sized data transfer by integrating multiple and heterogeneous challenged access networks, in which long delays, leaks (heavy packet losses), and frequent disconnections are observed. The goal is to utilize all the limited available resources on challenged access networks, without degradation of total performance of all the users sharing those same networks. An important feature is to explicitly separate and flexibly treat transmission of control information and that of data information consisting of data transfer, by conveying them on different types of communication media in different ways, depending upon the characteristics of the transmitting information and the communication medium (network path).	access network;elegant degradation;heterogeneous computing;network packet;transmitter	Akira Nagata;Shinya Yamamura;Masato Tsuru	2009	2009 International Conference on Intelligent Networking and Collaborative Systems	10.1109/INCOS.2009.71	transport;the internet;media;heterogeneous network;telecommunications;computer science;electronic data interchange;conceptual framework;distributed computing;packet loss;wireless;computer network;access network;retransmission	HPC	-7.974882480118266	90.00236658258487	84883

The development of wireless video transmission technologies has been boosted by the rapidly increasing demand of video streaming applications. Although more and more videos are delivered for video analysis (e.g., object detection/tracking and action recognition), most existing wireless video transmission schemes are developed to optimize human perception quality and are suboptimal for video analysis. In mobile surveillance networks, a cloud server collects videos from multiple moving cameras and detects suspicious persons in all camera views. Camera mobility in smartphones or dash cameras implies that video is to be uploaded through bandwidth-limited and error-prone wireless networks, which may cause quality degradation of the decoded videos and jeopardize the performance of video analyses. In this paper, we propose an effective rate-allocation scheme for multiple moving cameras in order to improve human detection (content) performance. Therefore, the optimization criterion of the proposed rate-allocation scheme is driven by quality of content (QoC). Both video source coding and application layer forward error correction coding rates are jointly optimized. Moreover, the proposed rate-allocation problem is formulated as a convex optimization problem and can be efficiently solved by standard solvers. Many simulations using High Efficiency Video Coding standard compression of video sequences and the deformable part model object detector are carried, and results demonstrate the effectiveness and favorable performance of our proposed QoC-driven scheme under different pedestrian densities and wireless conditions.	clock rate;code;codec;cognitive dimensions of notations;computer graphics;computer vision;concave function;convex function;convex optimization;data compression;distortion;domain-driven design;elegant degradation;emoticon;encoder;forward error correction;group of pictures;high efficiency video coding;ip camera;internet;joint source and channel coding;linear function;mathematical optimization;object detection;optimization problem;quality of service;sensor;server (computing);simulation;smartphone;streaming media;video coding format;video content analysis;virtual private server	Xiang Chen;Jenq-Neng Hwang;De Meng;Kuan-Hui Lee;Ricardo L. de Queiroz;Fu-Ming Yeh	2017	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology	10.1109/TCSVT.2016.2539758	simulation;uncompressed video;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;video tracking;multimedia;wireless	Vision	-7.301316705452926	104.00052643146596	84928

Currently, several prototypes of dedicated short range communications (DSRC) for vehicular networks have been developed by some companies for both intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and vehicular infrastructure integration (VII). However, most of the designers simply apply the existing indoor wireless technologies, such as Wi-Fi, into a vehicular environment without redesigning them for a vehicular environment. The vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) channels feature with doubly selective fading due to the high mobility of vehicles. Both theoretical analysis and experiments have verified that the indoor wireless technologies are unable to achieve optimized and robust performance when applied to a vehicular environment. Industry is calling for new physical and MAC layer protocols for ITS and VII. The IEEE 802.11p workgroup is currently working on standardizing the wireless access for vehicular environment (WAVE), which is anticipated to be ratified in 2009. In this paper, we brief the design of a WAVE prototype based on the IEEE 802.11p protocol, which allows us to implement and evaluate the performance of the IEEE 802.11p standard in a practical approach.	experiment;prototype;vehicle-to-vehicle;vii	Weidong Xiang;Yue Huang;Sudhan Majhi	2008	2008 IEEE 68th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECF.2008.461	vehicular ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;operating system;prototype;vehicular communication systems;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-15.050830710804755	90.33446045487679	85025

The special resources are implemented by servers: these have a modular design and each of them provides the facilities specific to one special resource. Enhanced connection types are supported by a two level architecture: homogeneous servers are arranged into logical subnetworks that are accessed by the users by means of point-to-point switched connections. New algorithms are designed to route point-tomultipoint and multipoint-to-point ATM virtual connections inside the logical subnetworks. To this purpose, two classes of heuristics are considered: those that take into account only the link’s spare capacity to identify a suitable and low cost routing; and those that attempt to minimize the number of resources assigned to a connection. The performance evaluation shows that the former have good connection blocking performance, are simpler and impose a lower load on the servers than the others. Kqvwords.

A range of HAS mechanisms have been proposed to enhance the Quality of Experience (QoE). However, existing mechanisms ignore the environmental impact in the QoE evaluation of mobile users, while the popularity of mobile video allows users to watch videos in diversified scenarios. In this paper, we propose an environment-aware HAS scheme that fully concentrates on the different criteria for evaluating video QoE under different environments. Using the advantage of the sensors in mobile phones, the scheme constructs and validates a video QoE model based on environment perception and then designs a model-driven, environment-aware HAS rate adaptation algorithm. We also evaluate the scheme with an environment-aware DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) player in real mobile environments. Compared to the benchmark HAS mechanism, the experimental results demonstrate that our scheme can provide appropriate differentiated rate adaptation for different environments, resulting in a higher QoE.

The proposed solution should be integrated in the existing European Railway Traffic Management System/European Train Control System, the most advanced and successful standard even outside the European countries. Our system integrates public land mobile networks that usually offer best-effort packet services, with a quality-of-service (QoS) guaranteed satellite network. It represents a cost-effective substitution for 4G and 5G networks, aiming to replace current well-known GSM-R standard. The coexistence of heterogeneous networks is guaranteed by the multi-path transmission control protocol (TCP) protocol that addresses specific “add and drop” subflow policies and priority handling logics, in order to realize efficient seamless handovers. Providing priority to TCP subflows corresponds to select QoS-guaranteed, and the best effort networks able to fulfill railway requirements. The logic of adding and dropping subflows exploits both a real-time check of the current status of the serving network and “a priori” network performance information. Experimental results have been carried out in both city and harsh environments, where the main performance metrics (i.e., average delay, jitter, and bit rate) have been assessed.	best-effort delivery;channel capacity;coexist (image);control system;experiment;management system;network architecture;network packet;network performance;packet delay variation;quality of service;real-time web;requirement;seamless3d;simulation;systems architecture;testbed	Yiwei Liu;Alessandro Neri;Agostino Ruggeri;Anna Maria Vegni	2017	IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems	10.1109/TITS.2016.2633531	simulation;engineering;automotive engineering;transport engineering	Networks	-11.75701806183701	93.37609256040581	85392

LTE is an all-IP packet switched technology. The evolution path towards LTE can be done in two ways. First, for GSM only operators, internetworking between GSM networks and LTE is envisioned to go through IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS). Second, for 3G/3.5G operators the internetworking can be utilized through Packet Data Network Gateway (P-GW). LTE deployment and internetworking with the existing GSM/EDGE Radio Access Technology (GERAN) and / or UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Networks (UTRAN) will bring out several technical issues. First, internetworking between GERAN and LTE will highlight the control of voice calls over IP networks. However, most operators agreed to support VoLTE. Second, LTE will be deployed in the same frequency band as of GERAN/UTRAN which will cause signalling problems. In this paper, first, based on service requests, we propose an algorithm to optimize the available network resources in multi radio deployment. Second, single radio IMS enhanced user equipment is modelled, and finally, a voice call continuity study will be conducted through a Discrete Event Simulator (DES) based on multi service environment.	algorithm;channel capacity;compaq lte;frequency band;gw-basic;ip multimedia subsystem;internet protocol suite;internetworking;mathematical optimization;network packet;packet switching;performance evaluation;scott continuity;software deployment;terrestrial television	Belal Abuhaija;Khalid Al-Begain	2010	2010 Fourth International Conference on Next Generation Mobile Applications, Services and Technologies	10.1109/NGMAST.2010.35	gsm;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;lte advanced;access stratum;computer network;umts terrestrial radio access network	Mobile	-13.108121266215104	92.36463272808592	85420

Normally, proactive routing protocols provide routing messages that establish default routes to ensure connectivity for outgoing IPv4 packets destined for the Internet. However, mechanisms to ensure connectivity for incoming IPv4 packets from the Internet are yet poorly documented in published material. Possible solutions include implementing a modified mobile IPv4 foreign agent (MIP-FA) or network address translation (NAT) on each Internet gateway node in the ad hoc network. In this paper we discuss different strategies for providing Internet access to proactive ad hoc networks. We also describe problems experienced in our lab test-bed with default routes under the condition of site multi-homing. Based on this experience, we propose working solutions for Internet access from proactive ad hoc networks.	accessibility;gateway (telecommunications);hoc (programming language);internet access;missile guidance;mobile ip;multihoming;network address translation;routing;software deployment;testbed	Paal E.

151661c7a2e3cafacc64990bc695076ab34c03f1	a group handoff scheme for the proximity service of sharing mobile data downloading		In this work, a group handoff scheme from a mobile AP to a fixed AP and vice versa for downloading and sharing of group touring's Points of Interests (POIs) based on the concept of proximity service were proposed. In a group touring scenario, the tour guide enables the Wi Fi hot spot service of his own handheld device, which plays the role of mobile proxy and mobile AP (m-AP), and each tourist has his handheld device to connect with the m-AP of the tour guide's handheld device. The tour guide's handheld device can download the corresponding POIs' contents from the server through the 4G cellular network and then forward these contents to all members' handheld devices using the Wi Fi Device-to-Device (D2D) communication paradigm. Related control messages are based on the Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication paradigm such that the downloading and sharing of POIs are automatic and user transparent. In this way, it can save the 4G cellular network's expense and reduce the traffic in the 4G cellular network. Moreover, when a POI provides free Wi Fi services through a fix APs (f-APs) to users, all of the group members' and tour guide's handheld devices can switch to the f-AP when they are inside the POI and then switch back to the m-AP of the tour guide's handheld device when they move out of the signal coverage of the f-AP. In this way, it can further save the 4G cellular network's expense and reduce the traffic in the 4G cellular network. Two control schemes called conservative and aggressive modes were proposed to handle the handoff from m-AP to f-AP mode and vice versa.

A re-transmission technique is also adopted to reduce the lost possibility of some important video frames.

522e0a36904ade7f8bd8d438f32c693e2c689a10	h.264 video delivery over wireless mesh networks based on joint adaptive cross-layer mapping and mdca mac		This paper presents a QoS-guaranteed transmission of H.264 video over Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) based on an adaptive cross-layer mapping of IEEE 802.11e MAC strategy. We call this MDCA (Mesh Distributed Channel Access) MAC strategy as it is based on 802.11e standard with adaptive mechanism in response to dynamic nature of mesh networks. This novel MDCA strategy employs the channel reservation control packets at the MAC layer to exchange timely Channel State Estimation information for an optimal FEC at the application layer as well as the QoS-centric GEDSR model [1] for an optimal adaptation. The proposed scheme offers an optimized transmission to guarantee the minimum packets delay and drop rate needed for video over WMNs. In this research, we resolve the problem associated with 802.11e standard by designing an integrated scheme that allows the system to achieve the optimal transmission via a FEC implemented in the application layer. We evaluate the proposed scheme based on network-level metrics, including bit rate, packets delay and drop rates in comparison with the static cross-layer mapping scheme based on 802.11e WMNs. We can confirm that the adaptive cross-layer mapping strategy MDCA outperforms the static cross-layer mapping scheme by a significant margin.

Openness and flexibility are indeed key factors for the success of the Web where end-users develop applications freely. As a consequence, end-users become producers and consumers of contents and services. End-users rely for their communication needs on communication platforms (CPs). CPs managed by Service Providers lack sufficient openness and flexibility for end users due to their own complexity. This paper examines the CPs from the perspective of openness and flexibility for end-users, and then proposes a novel concept, My Own Communication Service Provider (MOCSP). The key innovation is to provide an individual CP for an end-user for his/her communication services. To achieve this goal, we design a MOCSP system, based on a top-down and user-centric approach. Moreover, we analyse our approach in terms of benefits for end-users.	central processing unit;communications protocol;forking proxy;hypertext transfer protocol;openness;overhead (computing);parsing;routing;scalability;server (computing);situated;top-down and bottom-up design;web server;world wide web	Shanmugalingam Sivasothy;Noël Crespi;Paul Labrogere	2010	International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems	10.1109/ICUMT.2010.5676628	service provider;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer network	Networks	-15.808699224187643	92.70959767555898	86132

Part of these problems could be solved by providing standardized multimedia document communication services such asstoring, distribution, manipulation, and even more complex ones such as joint presentation! viewing or joint synchronous editing. This paper deals with the technical issues of designing such services based on standardized protocols, such as the 1TU-T T.120 Recommendations. Focus ismade on adding multipoint facilities to the document communication services taking advantage of the T.120 Recommendations.The paper discusses how to use the facilities provided by the T. 120 Recommendations to design multimedia document communication services such as Joint Presentation/Viewing (PV) or Joint Synchronous Editing (SE) that run on heterogeneous environments. The fast development andpenetration of the T.120 Recommendations make them an adequate platform in which to base other applications. The facilities of T.120 cover, between other features, multipoint communication, token management, conference control, etc. The T.120 multipoint communication Recommendations are the base for that design, and aredescribed briefly. These services could be based only on MCS, but the paper discusses how to map the service onto the complete T. 120 specifications, which also include GCC, that provides a wide variety of conferencing management functions that facilitate the development of documentcommunication services. The paper presents PV and SE, as examples, describing the rules to be followed during a PV or SE session. The paper also analyzes the most relevant issues of the services: start-up synchronization, late joining, early leaving, co-ordination, update, closing and final document copy. These aspects may cause problems in the design and implementation. The proposed design uses the conferencing capabilities specified in 0CC to support PV and SE services. The paper discusses how to solve the relevant issues of PV and SE using the facilities of GCC (and T. 120, in general).		Jaime Delgado;José J.

ddf24ef567824431c4bec8a45e1b0755899a7f98	gridcast: improving peer sharing for p2p vod	replication;caching;video on demand;peer to peer	Video-on-Demand (VoD) is a compelling application, but costly. VoD is costly due to the load it places on video source servers. Many have proposed using peer-to-peer (P2P) techniques to shift load from servers to peers. Yet, nobody has implemented and deployed a system to openly and systematically evaluate how these techniques work.  This article describes the design, implementation and evaluation of GridCast, a real deployed P2P VoD system. GridCast has been live on CERNET since May of 2006. It provides seek, pause, and play operations, and employs peer sharing to improve system scalability. In peak months, GridCast has served videos to 23,000 unique users. From the first deployment, we have gathered information to understand the system and evaluate how to further improve peer sharing through caching and replication.  We first show that GridCast with single video caching (SVC) can decrease load on source servers by an average of 22% from a client-server architecture. We analyze the net effect on system resources and determine that peer upload is largely idle. This leads us to changing the caching algorithm to cache multiple videos (MVC). MVC decreases source load by an average of 51% over the client-server. The improvement is greater as user load increases. This bodes well for peer-assistance at larger scales.  A detailed analysis of MVC shows that departure misses become a major issue in a P2P VoD system with caching optimization. Motivated by this observation, we examine how to use replication to eliminate departure misses and further reduce server load. A framework for lazy replication is presented and evaluated in this article. In this framework, two predictors are plugged in to create the working replication algorithm. With these two simple predictors, lazy replication can decrease server load by 15% from MVC with only a minor increase in network traffic.	asp.net mvc;algorithm;cache (computing);client–server model;lazy evaluation;mathematical optimization;model–view–controller;network address translation;network packet;optimistic replication;peer-to-peer;scalability;scott continuity;server (computing);simulation;software deployment;unique user;upload	Bin Cheng;Lex Stein;Hai Jin;Xiaofei Liao;Zheng Andrew Zhang	2008	TOMCCAP	10.1145/1412196.1412199	replication;real-time computing;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;world wide web;statistics;computer network	OS	-8.353023777317079	97.27924855179893	86279

fe766db083b1d439e9eec819a9c703de73e4e482	a sip/h.323 signaling gateway implementation for ip telephony		The Internet has truly become the ubiquitous communication infrastructure, bringing many benefits to the users and making the communication over IP the predominant protocol architecture for data and multimedia transmission (Web). The regular telephone service shall, in a near future, converge to the Internet, giving place to a single integrated voice and data network. IP telephony is growing, following this expected trend, and different protocol standards, as SIP and H.323, are available for this new service. In order to guarantee interoperability and give users the freedom of choosing from equipment and applications based on these protocols, a SIP/H.323 gateway has to exist. We present the implementation of a SIP/H.323 gateway, which allows a transparent interoperation to the users. The implementation unites the two protocol stacks over a simple signaling message channel, allowing partial utilization of two existing open source codes: OpenH323 Opengatekeeper and SIP client IPTele, developed at the Helsinki University of Technology (HUT). The modular approach allows using developed modules for implementing other gateways.	code;converge;internet;interoperability;interoperation;open-source software;openbsm;scalability	Bruno F.

In this article, we study a crucial video replication and placement problem in a distributed storage VoD cluster for high quality and high availability services. We formulate it as a combinatorial optimization problem with objectives of maximizing the encoding bit rate and the number of replicas of each video and balancing the workload of the servers. It is subject to the constraints of the storage capacity and the outgoing network bandwidth of the servers. Under the assumption of single fixed encoding bit rate for all videos, we give an optimal replication algorithm and a bounded placement algorithm for videos with different popularities. To reduce the complexity of the replication algorithm, we present an efficient algorithm that utilizes the Zipf-like video popularity distributions to approximate the optimal solution. For videos with scalable encoding bit rates, we propose a heuristic algorithm based on simulated annealing. We conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation of the algorithms and demonstrate their effectiveness via simulations over a synthetic workload set.	approximation algorithm;clustered file system;combinatorial optimization;computer cluster;display resolution;experiment;heuristic (computer science);high availability;internet backbone;mathematical optimization;network traffic control;optimization problem;performance evaluation;scalability;simulated annealing;simulation;synthetic intelligence;video;zipf's law;zipf–mandelbrot law;monotone	Xiaobo Zhou;Cheng-Zhong Xu	2002		10.1109/ICPP.2002.1040912	heuristic;availability;real-time computing;scalability;cost-effectiveness analysis;simulated annealing;combinatorial optimization;computer science;theoretical computer science;cluster analysis;videoconferencing;high availability;computational model;bandwidth;encoding;computer network	HPC	-8.359696588033303	102.82247303905889	86719

Vehicular communication is an essential part of building such intelligent systems. To provide inter-operability of wide vehicle range, common standards are needed. One of recently established standards for vehicular networks is IEEE 802.11p. However, 802.11p hardware platform market is limited due to protocol immaturity. Existing solutions are complex, expensive and closed-source systems with limited applicability. In this paper we propose an open, accessible and customizable wireless system for vehicular communication supporting IEEE 802.11p protocol. The system consists of low-cost components and open source software suitable for experimental intelligent transportation system research and applications. Nevertheless, real world tests prove feasibility of the system.	interoperability;open-source software;operability	Nikolajs Agafonovs;Girts Strazdins;Modris Greitans	2012	2012 The 11th Annual Mediterranean Ad Hoc Networking Workshop (Med-Hoc-Net)	10.1109/MedHocNet.2012.6257112	vehicular ad hoc network;ieee 802.11s;embedded system;ieee 802.1x;inter-access point protocol;ieee 802.11b-1999;engineering;ieee 802.11u;ieee 802.11h-2003;vehicular communication systems;ieee 802.11r-2008;computer security;computer network;ieee 802.11e-2005	Embedded	-15.419483106522021	90.06508354004583	86722

Large buffer generally improves video quality, since it accommodates wide range of rate variability. However it incurs large buffering delay, and it is not suitable for many streaming applications (e.g., video sharing). In this paper, we investigate the playout buffer requirement to ensure desired video quality, given network conditions and bitstream characteristics. We develop a unidirectional VBR video streaming model and derive an analytic expression of the minimum playout buffer requirement to achieve desired video quality.

Thus, minimum transmission quality cannot be guaranteed and, especially during times of network congestion or occasional link failures, UDP-based VoIP becomes unusable. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a rate-adaptive transmission system for highly scalable speech and audio codecs that uses the Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) approach for very low bit rates. In this way, as soon as the available transmission capacity falls below the minimum coding rate, our system switches to a Push-To-Talk (PTT) like conversational mode. Subjective conversational quality tests have shown that the algorithm allows for a good and effective conversation (MOS-CQS is 3.5) even in cases where traditional UDP based VoIP telephony fails (MOS-CQS is 1).	algorithm;best-effort delivery;codec;delay-tolerant networking;internet;network congestion;network switch;scalability;usability;whole earth 'lectronic link	Christian Hoene;Patrick Schreiner	2011		10.1145/1989240.1989257	real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;delay-tolerant networking;voice over ip;computer network	Networks	-5.839580138132204	98.50591435722032	87176

The approach requires all data traffic sent to a Mobile Node (MN) to travel via the central anchor point regardless of where the MN is currently attached in the Internet. This leads to increased packet delivery latency as the packets follow a non-optimal path via mobility anchor point in MN's home network. This paper develops a distributed mobility management scheme that releases the burden of the central mobility anchor by distributing the mobility routing function to the gateway of each sub-network. The scheme optimizes the data path for the MN that has moved to a visited network, hence, reduces the packet delivery latency. The paper presents in detail the scheme design, operational mechanism and performance evaluation through simulation. The simulation results show the improved packet delivery latency as compared to non-optimized scheme in both less loaded and heavily loaded network conditions.	centralized computing;digital molecular matter (dmm);internet;mathematical optimization;network packet;optimization mechanism;performance evaluation;proxy mobile ipv6;router (computing);routing;simulation;subnetwork	Petro P.

The ubiquitous availability of wireless data communication networks is an additional driving force. Their ability to support application data flows is one of the performance criteria for successful mobile application deployment. Nevertheless, the quantitative impact of this performance is unknown and practically infeasible to determine at real-time at the application-level due to mobile device resource constraints. We research practical methods for measurement-based application-level performance evaluation of data communication networks that support mobile application data flows. In this paper, we apply the lightweight Comparative Output-Input Analysis (COIA) method that estimates additional delay at observation time scale of interest (e.g. 1 s) induced on the application data flow. The additional delay is the amount of delay exceeding non-avoidable, minimal end-to-end data delay caused by data communication network propagation and transmission delays. We propose five COIA methods to estimate the additional delay. We validate their accuracy with measurements obtained from an m-health application, namely health telemonitoring provided by the MobiHealth system. Despite their simplicity, our methods prove to be accurate in relation to the observation time scale of interest, and robust under a variety of network conditions. The methods offer novel insights into the impact of data communication network performance on the application data flow delay behaviour.	access network;application domain;control system;dataflow;end-to-end encryption;mhealth;microsoft outlook for mac;mobile app;mobile device;network performance;oversampling;performance evaluation;real-time clock;run time (program lifecycle phase);software deployment;software propagation;telecommunications network;throughput;time series;tracing (software);undefined behavior;wireless access point	Katarzyna Wac;Markus Fiedler;Richard Bults;Hermie Hermens	2010	2010 IEEE Network Operations and Management Symposium - NOMS 2010	10.1109/NOMS.2010.5488456	quality assurance;embedded system;data flow diagram;synchronization;estimation;throughput;performance management;real-time computing;simulation;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;time series;mobile device;network performance;computer security;network delay;computer network	Mobile	-11.059337154357939	95.10143147267942	87352

All home agents are formed into the structure of ring detection & backup chain by sorting them using a deterministic sorting algorithm, in which each home agent backups its bindings on the next adjacent home agent and its validation is monitored by the adjacent home agents. Each home agent is not only an active home agent, but also a standby one. Service takeover is fleetly implemented by the single replica of mobility bindings.

The characteristics of satellite channels (notably the large round trip delay) heavily influence the TCP flow control, which is essentially based on acknowledgements. The effect is a delay in the acknowledgement reception and, consequently, in the delivery of messages, with respect to cabled networks. The drawbacks of using TCP in a satellite environment may be mitigated by a proper tuning of some TCP parameters. The behaviour of the protocol, as a consequence of variations in the buffer length of both transmitter and receiver and in the initial congestion window, is investigated in the paper and a proper configuration that drastically improves performance (measured by the throughput in bytes/s and by the overall transmission time) is proposed. Two test environments have been used to evaluate the proposed modifications: a real testbed, composed of two remote hosts connected through a satellite channel, and a satellite network emulator, composed of three PCs (two of them representing two hosts, the third one reproducing the behaviour of the satellite link). In both environments, a ftp-like application designed for the aim has represented the reference application; three different file sizes have been used and the different effect of the tuning, depending on the transfer length, has been evidenced; the analysis includes both the single application case and the multiple application case, where several connections a time share the satellite link.

This problem is a big issue at the boundary of wired and wireless networks, and it can cause streamed media applications to perform poorly. For streamed MPEG video, packet loss can induce an incorrect MPEG video bit-stream syntax. At the video player the corrupt stream leads to an improper decoding of frames resulting in a poor viewer experience that can include frame corruption, frame freezing and tiling artifacts. Even very few packet losses can result in a noticeable decay in perceived video quality. To solve this problem, we propose a deterministic in-network selective packet forwarding algorithm that preserves MPEG video syntax while reducing the bandwidth of the video stream to be below the bottleneck bandwidth. Optimality of the forwarding algorithm is achieved by solving a 0-1 knapsack problem using estimated video parameters. We evaluate the proposed scheme for real MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 video streams.

Now, it is becoming clear that future sophisticated services breaking away from the simple telephony call model, e.g., multimedia, multiparty conferencing, etc., will need to be rapidly and efficiently introduced, deployed, shared, operated and managed. In this context, TINA developed a comprehensive architecture for multi-service networks that will support multimedia services. On the other hand, the provisioning of all the service management functionality for TINA services (i.e. FCAPS) is still an open research question. In this paper, we discuss accounting features and requirements, security of accounting management, and issues for their integration in a TINA-based service environment. A prototype has been implemented to validate the concepts and results are also presented.	centralized computing;data model;intelligent network;open research;prototype;provisioning;requirement;security management;tina (software)	Luis Marco Cáceres Alvarez;Wagner Tatsuya Watanabe;Carlos Becker Westphall;Abderrahim Sekkaki	2001		10.1109/SCCC.2001.972631	business;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Networks	-16.935950043725892	93.22742651910315	88033

Mobile IP has many configuration and enhancements that are proposed by IETF such as the Careof-Address (CoA), Collocated CoA, Mobile IPv6, and route optimizations. In this paper, we present a side-by-side performance evaluation and comparisons of the UMTS to WLAN handoff delay that results from using each configuration in the lately adopted UMTS/WLAN interworking architecture by 3GPP. In addition, we analyze the delay components due to 3GPP security and Internet protocol integration requirements. Simulation results show that under low network loading all configurations yield similar performances. However, Mobile IP with IPv6 configuration is more sensitive for network loads and wireless access speeds. In fact, it produces the highest delay figures at high load. Moreover, 3GPP security procedures contribute to more than 60% of the handoff delay for all the configurations.	delay line memory;mobile ip;performance evaluation;requirement;simulation	Abdul-Aziz Al-Helali;Ashraf S.

d42423473f676d729e800ff0a552303883b5e700	lte/lte-a network security data collection and analysis for security measurement: a survey		The long-term evolution (LTE)/LTE-advanced (LTE-A) network provides advanced services for billions of users with its higher bandwidths, better spectrum efficiency, and lower latency than legacy cellular networks. But it still suffers from new security threats due to its all IP-based heterogeneous architecture. Therefore, there is a critical need to perform a rapid and accurate network security measurement in the LTE/LTE-A network. To achieve LTE/LTE-A network security measurement, security-relevant data (in short security data) collection and data analysis for attack detection are required as prerequisites. However, most of the existing work only focuses on data collection and analysis for a certain type of LTE/LTE-A attacks. Little work has been done to comprehensively perform data collection and analysis for detecting various attacks on the LTE/LTE-A network. Different from previous work, in this paper, we review the security data collection and data analysis methods in terms of various attacks in order to provide the basis of security measurement in the LTE/LTE-A network. We first present a comprehensive taxonomy of attacks according to the LTE/LTE-A network structure. Then, we propose a number of criteria for evaluating the performance of data collection and analysis methods. And we lay our emphasis on the survey of data collection and analysis methods for significant active attack detection in the LTE/LTE-A network. All the reviewed methods are analyzed and discussed based on the proposed evaluation criteria. Furthermore, current open issues and future research challenges are presented with a view to stimulating future research. Finally, an adaptive data collection and data analysis model for security measurement in the LTE/LTE-A network is proposed.	common criteria;compaq lte;network security;next-generation network;sensor;spectral efficiency	Limei He;Zheng Yan;Mohammed Atiquzzaman	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2792534	telecommunications network;data collection;computer network;architecture;lte advanced;distributed computing;data analysis;computer science;network security;next-generation network;cellular network	Security	-24.937507633968927	95.10446042311919	88537
9ead3bdfc0aa845bafe9263ef0100fd2521f2c0a	smart resource allocation for improving qoe in ip multimedia subsystems		Abstract IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) is a robust multimedia service. IMS becomes more important when delivering multimedia services. Multimedia service providers can benefit from IMS to ensure a good QoE (Quality of Experience) to their customers with minimal resources usage. In this paper, we propose an intelligent media distribution IMS system architecture for delivering video streaming. The system is based primarily on uploading a multimedia file to a server in the IMS. Later, other users can download the uploaded multimedia file from the IMS. In the system, we also provide the design of the heuristic decision methods and models based on probability distributions. Thus, our system takes into account the network parameters such as bandwidth, jitter, delay and packet loss that influence the QoE of the end-users. Moreover, we have considered the other parameters of the energy consumption such as CPU, RAM, temperature and number connected users that impact the result of the QoE. All these parameters are considered as input to our proposal management system. The measurements taken from the real test bench show the real performance and demonstrate the success of the system about ensuring the upload speed of the multimedia file, guaranteeing the QoE of end users and improving the energy efficiency of the IMS.	ip multimedia subsystem	Alejandro Canovas;Miran Taha;Jaime Lloret Mauri;Jesús Tomás	2018	J.

22bd3a35b9550bc5b570a0beee5648eb9033be3b	understanding the impact of video quality on user engagement	average bitrate;content type;buffering ratio;content provider;video quality;live content;vod content;90-minute live video event;spans different content type;user engagement	As the distribution of the video over the Internet becomes main- stream and its consumption moves from the computer to the TV screen, user expectation for high quality is constantly increasing. In this context, it is crucial for content providers to understand if and how video quality affects user engagement and how to best invest their resources to optimize video quality. This paper is a first step towards addressing these questions. We use a unique dataset that spans different content types, including short video on demand (VoD), long VoD, and live content from popular video con- tent providers. Using client-side instrumentation, we measure quality metrics such as the join time, buffering ratio, average bitrate, rendering quality, and rate of buffering events.  We quantify user engagement both at a per-video (or view) level and a per-user (or viewer) level. In particular, we find that the percentage of time spent in buffering (buffering ratio) has the largest impact on the user engagement across all types of content. However, the magnitude of this impact depends on the content type, with live content being the most impacted. For example, a 1% increase in buffering ratio can reduce user engagement by more than three minutes for a 90-minute live video event. We also see that the average bitrate plays a significantly more important role in the case of live content than VoD content.	client–server model;display resolution;video clip	Florin Dobrian;Vyas Sekar;Asad Awan;Ion Stoica;Dilip Antony Joseph;Aditya Ganjam;Jibin Zhan;Hui Zhang	2011		10.1145/2018436.2018478	computer science;video quality;multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web;measurement	Networks	-9.550806793298339	98.6592316730879	88691

However, designing a low-latency interactive communication for the high-resolution screen content is still challenging due to the network dynamics and the unique characteristics of screen content. In this paper we propose a H.264 based low-latency screen sharing system. To achieve high play-out frame rate, we decouple the low-latency screen content communication problem into two parts, a scalable H.264 based encoding and an optimal scalable stream transmission scheduling. By leveraging the unique characteristics of screen content, a multi-layer scalable video encoding scheme is designed to achieve a certain error resilience while keeping good video coding efficiency. In the transmission scheduling module, an optimal frame skipping policy is proposed to schedule the frames in the buffer to maximize the play-out frame rate. In the performance evaluation, we simulate our system in both one-hop end-to-end topology and two-hop proxy-based topology. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves much better performance on frame rate and average delay, especially in the low bandwidth condition.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;codec;data compression;end-to-end principle;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;image resolution;layer (electronics);line code;mobile cloud computing;multi-user;performance evaluation;remote desktop software;scalability;scheduling (computing);simulation	Ming Yang;Jingjing Fu;Yan Lu;Jianfei Cai;Chuan Heng Foh	2014	2014 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2014.6865594	codec;real-time computing;cloud computing;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;mobile computing;frame rate;bandwidth;encoding;computer network	Mobile	-7.680524527263279	101.31810286178563	88863

There are two critical issues facing successful deployment of m-health applications from the wireless communications perspectives. First, wireless connectivity issues and mobility requirements of real-time bandwidth demanding m-health applications. Second, are the Quality of Service (QoS) issues from the healthcare perspective and their required levels to guarantee robust and clinically acceptable healthcare services. In this paper, we consider the concept of medical QoS (m-QoS) issues for typical bandwidth demanding m-health application (tele-ultrasound streaming) in 3G environments. Specifically we introduce this new concept of m-QoS that provide a sub-category of quality of services from the m-health perspective. To validate this concept we also propose a new optimal rate control policy based on Q-learning approach to deliver the ultrasound images over 3G environment.	mhealth;medical ultrasound;q-learning;quality of service;real-time transcription;requirement;software deployment;television	Nada Y.

This paper deals with a traffic model for large-scale ISDN-PABX's. It concerns the telephone, teletex, facsimile, interactive videotex and data dialog services. Based on measurement results or if none were available on general reflections and assumptions, these ISDN services are described by their call mixes and by the mean holding times of the terminals involved. The volume of ISDN traffic anticipated for the futdre in the Federal Republic of Germany is taken as an example so as to extend the traffic model shown to an overall traffic model for complete ISDNPABX's. In this way the model helps to formulate traffic design objectives for new ISDN-PABX's in the F.R.Germany.	amiga reflections;integrated services digital network;teletex;videotex;dialog	Helga Hofstetter;Dietmar Weber	1986	Computer Networks	10.1016/0169-7552(85)90015-7	teletraffic engineering;simulation;telecommunications;traffic mix;computer science;integrated services digital network;computer security;computer network	Networks	-19.726090610443585	93.2184230164199	89212

However, the frequent association and dissociation of devices to the network and several communications patterns hamper the address control and negotiation. In general, addressing strategies for heterogeneous wireless networks are individualized and do not adapt fast enough to several address patterns from each communication technology, hindering the seamless handoffs. This paper presents an innovative dynamic address scheme for heterogeneous wireless networks founded on Network Function Virtualization (NFV) approach aiming to support the avoidance of interruptions in end-to-end communications and providing seamless handoffs. It is described a method for the unification of the network address formats on mobile devices and for the negotiation of dynamic addresses in order to offer continuous communication. The proposed method has been evaluated by simulations, taking into account WiFi and WiMAX communication technologies. Simulation results show the strategy effectiveness and the maintenance of the end-to-end communication under handoff scenarios.	access network;authentication;capability-based addressing;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;mobile device;network address;network function virtualization;seamless3d;simulation;unification (computer science)	Robson Melo;Farouk Mezghani;Michele Nogueira Lima;Aldri Luiz dos Santos	2016	2016 Wireless Days (WD)	10.1109/WD.2016.7461518	real-time computing;heterogeneous network;global network;public land mobile network;computer science;wireless network;distributed computing;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	-12.558234875169187	90.13120691838799	89427

In particular, we evaluate the impact of 1) TCP loss rates; 2) user interrupts; 3) connection volume and their durations; and 4) variations in TCP throughputs on web applications. Since TCP behavior is dependent on events like packet losses, timeouts, and connection terminations, which affect the behavior of TCP-based web applications. The phenomena is more prominent in wireless networks. Our collected real network traffic traces provides very interesting insight on the TCP behavior showing the effect of TCP throughput on packet losses and user interrupted connections, which in turn also increases unnecessary retransmissions. Our performance evaluation reveal that the longer duration and higher volumes of TCP connections is a function of higher interrupted connections and loss rates. By further studying the statistical properties of TCP connections shows that the loss rate increases with decrease in connection duration, and also leads to frequent termination of TCP connections.	hypertext transfer protocol;interrupt;mike lesser;network packet;network traffic control;performance evaluation;throughput;tracing (software);web application	Saeed Ullah;Imdad Ullah;Hassaan Khaliq Qureshi;Rim Haw;Sungman Jang;Choong Seon Hong	2014	The International Conference on Information Networking 2014 (ICOIN2014)	10.1109/ICOIN.2014.6799718	compound tcp;radio link protocol;real-time computing;the internet;tcp global synchronization;tcp westwood plus;tcp pacing;telecommunications;computer science;tcp hole punching;transmission control protocol;h-tcp;zeta-tcp;hstcp;tcp tuning;network congestion;tcp acceleration;tcp friendly rate control;slow-start;transport layer;computer network	Metrics	-5.019353985149803	92.68032080812223	89485

This paper focuses on the handoffrelated MAC-Layer scanning latencies in IEEE 802.11- based Fixed Relay Radio Access Networks (FRRAN). The IEEE 802.11 scanning procedure is known to have latencies of 300 to 550 ms, which exceeds the requirements of real-time applications like Voice over IP (VoIP) by far. Previous solutions for this problem have only focused on the IEEE 802.11 infrastructure mode. However, the IEEE 802.11 ad-hoc mode is a better basis for FRRANs because it enables mobile nodes to use all relays in range, e.g. for load balancing purposes, instead of being associated to a single access point only as in infrastructure mode. Therefore, we present a novel fast-scan concept for IEEE 802.11 ad-hoc-mode-based FRRANs. The key idea is to answer MAC-layer probe requests by IP-based probe responses, which are sent back to a scanning node via the FRRAN infrastructure. The benefit of this cross-layer concept is that scanning nodes can return to their current channel quickly and can continue to send and receive normal data packets while awaiting the IP-based probe responses. We implemented our solution for commodity IEEE 802.11 hardware and could reduce scanning latencies to 70 to 80 ms.	access time;hoc (programming language);interactivity;load balancing (computing);network packet;overhead (computing);real-time clock;relay;requirement;return channel;simulation;single-access key;wireless access point	Sebastian Speicher;Christian Bünnig	2006	International Conference on Networking, International Conference on Systems and International Conference on Mobile Communications and Learning Technologies (ICNICONSMCL'06)	10.1109/ICNICONSMCL.2006.98	ieee 802.11s;real-time computing;ieee 802.1x;telecommunications;inter-access point protocol;ieee 802.11b-1999;computer science;wireless network;ieee 802.11h-2003;voice over ip;ieee 802.11r-2008;wireless multimedia extensions;computer network;ieee 802.11e-2005;ieee 802.1q	Visualization	-11.025191286114833	89.75575213070466	90031

However, providing such guarantees remains a challenge essentially because it requires a strong and fair cooperation among the different network operators or Autonomous Systems (ASes), crossed by the traffic. Having a single AS on the path that does not meet its QoS engagement is sufficient to violate the end-to-end QoS guarantees. Unfortunately, the client is not capable of distinguishing unfair ASes from honest ones at the time it selects its path. Reputation mechanisms turn out to be very efficient tools to estimate how trustworthy and reliable entities can be without requiring the help of any central authority. They are effective to foster cooperation by remedying selfishness.

The size of the segments has a major impact on the stalls. In adaptive video streaming, clients adapt the bit-rate of the video to minimize the stalls. But it often degrades the video quality. In order to maintain a high video quality, we can adapt the duration of the segments instead of the bit-rate. Thus the splicing technique can have a major impact on a video streaming. In this paper, we studied different video splicing techniques for peer-to-peer video streaming. We spliced MPEG-4 video based on different durations and Group of Picture (GOP). We found that the duration based splicing performs better than the GOP based splicing, though the duration based splicing requires much more data to be transferred than the GOP based splicing. In P2P video streaming, peers can leave the swarm anytime. To maximize the availability of a segment, peers often download multiple segments simultaneously. Again, if a peer downloads too many segments at a time, it will increase stalls. In this paper, we proposed a formula to calculate the number of video segments a peer should download simultaneously in order to reduce the stalls. We conducted the experiment on GENI.	anytime algorithm;download;http live streaming;hypertext transfer protocol;peer-to-peer;streaming media;swarm;video	Md Iftakharul Islam;Javed I.

The overlay network flexibly selects its communication paths and targets and thus can benefit from estimation of end-to-end network performances. For an overlay network with n end hosts, most of the existing systems have to send O (n2) probes into the network and then they calculate the performances of all links. Although these systems to some extent can determine the performances of the links, they have to send plenty of probes into the network, which has generated great traffic and imposed extra overload in the network. In order to address the problem, we propose a new approach based on probe prediction method by which we only need to measure a few probes in the probe set and predict out the responses of the rest probes and then we revise the final prediction results and find out the suspected congested links set. The experiments have shown that we only need to send about 20% of the total probes and infer all the responses of these probes with higher accuracy than ever before.	algorithm;end-to-end principle;experiment;overlay network;performance	Shun-an Wu;Qiao Yan;Xuesong Qiu;Yanjie Ren	2011	2011 7th International Conference on Network and Service Management		monitor;real-time computing;the internet;overlay network;prediction;sparse matrix;computer science;accuracy and precision;overlay;network performance;world wide web;measurement;statistics;computer network;collaboration	HPC	-5.986183954727883	90.52856206609417	90465

The LTE standard was first published in March 2009 as part of the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release 8 specifications. The specifications have been in development since 2005 when 3GPP defined LTE requirements and performance goals to significantly improve on the 3GPP Release 6 standard, which was at that point the state of the art. Achieving those goals required an evolution of both the air interface and the network architecture, now known as Evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) and Evolved Packet Core (EPC), respectively. The very first commercial LTE networks were deployed on a limited scale in Scandinavia at the end of 2009, and currently, large-scale deployments are taking place in several regions, including North America, Europe, and Asia.	compaq lte;electronic product code;network architecture;radio access network;requirement;terrestrial television	Bjørn A.

2d063bedfd4322697ce2f55c3582772f91251957	mmsrp: multi-wavelength markov-based split reservation protocol for dwdm optical networks	blocking probability;wdm;optical network;splitting;wdm network;wdm optical network;optical networks;setup time;markov model;wavelength division multiplex	During wavelength reservation in Wavelength Division Multiplexed (WDM) optical networks, often multiple connection requests unknowingly compete for the same wavelength, even when other free wavelengths are available, resulting in a collision. The Markov model used in Markov Based Reservation Protocol (MBRP), is very effective to reduce such conflicts by intelligently guessing a wavelength in advance. Even then a connection request may be blocked because of the vulnerable period between wavelength probing and actual reservation. To minimize the effect of such vulnerability, splitting the probe process to fork out a partial reservation from an intermediate node is an efficient solution. In Markov-selection Split Reservation Protocol (MSRP), the above two strategies are combined, but only one wavelength is guessed during probing. If the attempt with this single wavelength fails, the connection request is blocked. To take care of this limitation, we propose here a new scheme called Multi-wavelength MSRP (MMSRP), where a set of wavelengths (instead of one) is selected by Markov model and continuously updated for possible future use. In case of failure, during reservation in the backward direction, it retries to reserve the next best wavelength through another splitting at the failure point. Thus, MMSRP handles multiple wavelengths sequentially through multiple splitting. Simulation results show that the blocking probability in MMSRP decreases considerably (~25% over MSRP and ~50% over MBRP in some cases) as the number of wavelengths increases. Compared to MSRP, though the average setup time is marginally higher in MMSRP, it appears quite promising for delay-tolerant applications, where blocking is very crucial, in dense WDM networks.	blocking (computing);care-of address;erlang (unit);flip-flop (electronics);markov chain;markov model;simulation;wavelength-division multiplexing	Malabika Sengupta;Swapan Kumar Mondal;Debashis Saha	2010		10.1145/1774088.1774230	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;markov model;splitting;wavelength-division multiplexing;computer network	Arch	-9.781841195778597	89.49703015769133	91029

LMP also provides assistance in fault localization, both in opaque and transparent optical networks. In this paper, we show how LMP relates to the generalized multi-protocol label switching (GMPLS) suite of protocols and integrates into a distributed GMPLS control plane. We describe the role of LMP in two applications: data link (auto-)discovery and the establishment of forwarding adjacency label-switched paths (FA-LSPs) including their initiation, verification and bundling, and conclude that they can be built upon basic functions of LMP, namely control channel management, link verification and link property correlation.	aggregate data;control plane;generalized multi-protocol label switching;multiprotocol label switching;test engineer	Dimitri Papadimitriou;Fabrice Poppe;Bart Rousseau	2004	Photonic Network Communications	10.1023/B:PNET.0000031616.89490.8b	telecommunications;distributed computing;link access procedures, d channel;computer network	Networks	-23.762537849085525	89.04619178773133	91068

To date, P2P video streaming applications are widely popular and emphasized, e.g., PPstream and PPlive, because of higher transmission speed and data availability. However, in the heterogeneous P2P network environment, users are able to utilize PDA, notebook or desktop computer through distinct network interfaces to get on-demand videos ubiquitously. To provide distinct spatial-resolution/fidelity videos and flexible video transmission (playback) over P2P networks, a brand new coding architecture needs to be devised. In the proposed Co-SVC-MDC coding scheme, distinct MDC descriptions contain distinct portions of raw video frames, and each raw frame can be compressed as base layer and SVC enhancement layers. In our experiments, a real implementation of Co-SVC-MDC is exhibited and corresponding performances, e.g., PSNR and decoding speeds, are compared with original SVC in distinct congestion-level P2P networks.	co-np-complete;data compression;desktop computer;experiment;gene co-expression network;multi-core processor;multiple description coding;network congestion;network packet;pps.tv;parallel computing;peak signal-to-noise ratio;peer-to-peer;performance;personal digital assistant;programming paradigm;scalability;scalable video coding;streaming media;uncompressed video;upload;video clip	Chung-Ming Huang;Chung-Wei Lin;Chia-Ching Yang;Chung-Heng Chang;Hao-Hsiang Ku	2009	2009 IEEE/ACS International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications	10.1109/AICCSA.2009.5069442	video compression picture types;scalable video coding;real-time computing;h.263;computer science;network interface;video tracking;multimedia;video processing;smacker video;motion compensation;h.261;computer network;multiview video coding	HPC	-8.40654020245926	102.35830041069009	91223

In this paper, we first present QoE models that characterize user satisfaction of video, audio, and data services over wireless networks. We then develop a novel packet scheduling algorithm for multi-hop wireless networks that jointly optimizes the delivery of multiple video, audio, and data flows according to the QoE metrics. We formulate a multidimensional optimization problem that minimizes the overall distortion across all flows for the given network resources on wireless links. Fairness constraints over the flows are also considered as part of the optimization. Our experimental results, obtained with the NS-2 IEEE 802.16 MESH-mode simulator, show that distortion-aware scheduling can significantly increase the perceived quality of different wireless services under bandwidth constraints. Additionally, improved fairness across the competing flows is demonstrated relative to conventional scheduling techniques.	algorithm;distortion;fairness measure;internet access;mathematical optimization;mesh networking;network architecture;network packet;optimization problem;quality of service;scheduling (computing);software metric;wireless mesh network	Andre B.

These two standards lean on a centralized architecture made up of home location registers (HLRs) and visitor location registers (VLRs). From these standards, the location update and search procedures always imply interrogation of the HLR, even if the two mobile terminals that want to communicate are in the same location area. Given the limited bandwidth of the radio operator channel and the new time sensitive applications of third-generation systems, such an approach of mobility management is not convenient for the next generation mobile networks. This paper proposes a method for reducing the processing load and the signalization traffic generated by update and search location procedures compared to IS-41 standard. Taking into account the specific characteristics of the traffic in the mobile networks, it introduces a semi-dynamic approach based on a hybrid architecture using forwarding pointers without the load related to the dynamic models. Numerical results show that such a method significantly improves the efficiency of location procedures.

Time-based pricing schemes could be used to address this problem. However, in this kind of scheme, the workload of each base station is not normally considered in the methodology for pricing definition. During network peak periods, different base stations do not have the same workload and, consequently, a time-based pricing can be unfair to users who are outside of a congestion area. This paper presents a pricing scheme that uses base stations' historical workload data to differentiate prices in order to control the geographical congestion in the ISP network. We are currently simulating the proposed pricing model and other models to perform a comparative analysis in terms of performance and feasibility.	network congestion;qualitative comparative analysis;simulation	Agripino Gabriel Miranda Damasceno;Raquel A.

As an example, we illustrate a network consisting of a GSM General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) air interface and a Mobile IP backbone network. The advantage of such a solution is that the backbone network may easily be used to support integrated wireless and wired data transfer, and the leveraging of standard data networking protocols and equipment will reduce the cost of wireless data networks. We present issues and suggested solutions for mobility management functions, such as detecting changes in points of attachment to a network, micromobility, roaming, and paging, and security functions, such as authentication and ciphering.

To tackle this problem, taking into account that not all video data are equally important from a viewpoint of surveillance or observation applications, our research group proposes an autonomous control mechanism, where each node appropriately determines its video coding rate according to the location and velocity of targets without any centralized control. In this paper, we implemented the mechanism and conducted practical experiments. We verified that the video coding rate was appropriately adjusted and the loss of packets was suppressed. Consequently, the perceived video quality was higher than the cases where the lowest coding rate was always used to avoid congestion and the highest coding rate was always used intending the high quality video.	algorithm;autonomous robot;centralized computing;data compression;display resolution;dummy variable (statistics);experiment;image sensor;network congestion;network packet;norm (social);real-time computing;velocity (software development);video;visual sensor network	Hiroshi Yamamoto;Katsuya Hyodo;Naoki Wakamiya;Masayuki Murata	2008	2008 Second ACM/IEEE International Conference on Distributed Smart Cameras	10.1109/ICDSC.2008.4635702	embedded system;simulation;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;video tracking;reaction–diffusion system;statistics;computer network	Mobile	-5.281797024073792	102.9168928980498	92082

More importantly, measurement of technical parameters fails to give an account of the user experience, what could be named QoE (Quality of Experience). Therefore, many techniques have been developed in order to assess as accurately as possible this perceptual quality. To investigate QoE measurement, this paper presents three approaches namely subjective approach, objective approach, and hybrid approach. It also presents performance evaluation of these approaches for assessing QoE in video streaming application over wireless networks in different network conditions (using variation of loss rate and its distribution). We focus more specifically on a hybrid approach called Pseudo Subjective Quality Assessment (PSQA) that keeps advantages of both subjective and objective schemes while minimizing their drawbacks. We demonstrate that this approach provides good estimations comparing to the well-known objective metric called Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR). We also observe that PSQA gives similar result comparing to subjective test that has been evaluated by human observers in most of the cases. Moreover, one objective of this evaluation is to validate PSQA for QoE measurement, which will facilitate the use of QoE as metric for resource management in the future. For that, we also give some possible directions allowing us to manage network resources using this metric.	computer user satisfaction;peak signal-to-noise ratio;performance evaluation;streaming media;user experience;whole earth 'lectronic link	Kandaraj Piamrat;César Viho;Jean-Marie Bonnin;Adlen Ksentini	2009	2009 Sixth International Conference on Information Technology: New Generations	10.1109/ITNG.2009.121	simulation;peak signal-to-noise ratio;computer science;resource management;wireless network;multimedia;computer network	Mobile	-9.496064874553245	100.35630326816175	92110

Although many existing communications protocols and services do offer some limited support for multicast or group communication, the new requirements of multipeer applications make it difficult to find efficient and comprehens ive solutions. In this paper we discuss the required characteristics of group services and survey the extent of the support provided by today’s services and protocols. In addition, a brief outline of standardisation efforts in this area within ISO and ITU is given and selected examples of research projects which deal with different aspects of group communication are presented.	communications protocol;entity;multicast;requirement	Andreas Mauthe;Geoff Coulson;David Hutchison;Silvester Namuye	1995		10.1007/3-540-61028-6_16	telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;multimedia	DB	-16.026762230756795	93.37161400327219	92175

Therefore, information-centric mobile ad hoc networks(ICMANET), a new cross-cutting research area, is gradually forming. First of all, we introduce the current advances in ICN and analyze its development trends, and then interpret the formation of ICMANET and sketch an overview of it. Subsequently, we define a concept model for content routing and categorize the content routing into proactive, reactive and opportunistic, and then detail the representative schemes.

All big companies in the field have invested and intended to deploy eMBMS as the broadcast solution in response to the immense demand in multimedia traffic. The eMBMS, also known as LTE broadcast, can provide high quality live video streaming services for a large number of users simultaneously in an open area such as a stadium or arena during an entertainment or sport event. Nowadays, in a high mobility environment, maintaining the service reception for moving users becomes a crucial task for mobile operators and service providers. Unfortunately, the support from LTE standard for eMBMS service continuity is very limited at the moment and in many cases, the users cannot continue to receive their desired services. To overcome the limitation in the standard, this paper will present a novel method to ensure the service continuity as well as to reduce the service interruption time during handover period for eMBMS users in the mobility context.	compaq lte;display resolution;interrupt;multimedia broadcast multicast service;scott continuity;streaming media	Ngoc-Duy Nguyen;Christian Bonnet	2014	2014 IEEE 11th Consumer Communications and Networking Conference (CCNC)	10.1109/CCNC.2014.6866574	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;lte advanced;multimedia broadcast multicast service;computer network	Mobile	-8.81157417108075	99.66825319528293	92626

Poor or non-existent copper/fibre and mesh networks, largely inefficient telecommunications management and/or ineffective telecommunications policies in addition to poor infrastructure have made it nearly impossible to deliver essential services in health, education, trade and industry etc. In this paper, existing 3 G high-speed packet networks is evaluated as an alternative intervention to poor telecommunication infrastructure for the delivery of essential services such as telemedicine, emergency health services, tele-education and e-commerce in under-serviced areas. Simulation results show that HSDPA in target areas with rural, hilly and remote urban environments meet QoS parameters in terms of bit rates that are well above the minimum of 32 kbps for a H.263 codec target bit-rate of 16 kbps video quality. The envisioned capacity satisfies the QoS parameters for provision of essential services, if a distributed centralized approach is adopted. 3 G streaming can thus be used to deliver essential services in under-serviced areas.	centralized computing;codec;data rate units;e-commerce;fiber-optic communication;mesh networking;network packet;quality of service;simulation;software deployment;streaming media;television	P.

ce9c0e4b1ef717e7e84417accd0b00eba0203e28	poster: redundancy aided vehicular networking		Vehicular applications are increasingly connected to cloud services. For example, route planning, gas price applications, and Siri-like personal assistants all respond to user queries based in part on cloud processing. Network communication thus is often a substantial component of user-perceived latency in vehicular applications. Current vehicular computing platforms typically connect to the cloud using a single cellular network provider. Network conditions can change rapidly as a vehicle moves due to geographical variation in coverage, radio shadows, and differing traffic density. Such variation is often exacerbated by connection re-establishment after an interface has entered a sleep state. Thus, vehicular applications can often appear unresponsive due to high wireless network latency. Even worse, the responsiveness is unpredictable; high tail latency makes some user interactions take longer, even when most interactions complete in an acceptable amount of time. This unpredictability is especially worrisome in a vehicular environment, in which occasional unexpected performance anomalies distract the driver of the vehicle.	cloud computing;interaction;responsiveness;siri	Hyunjong Lee;Jason Flinn	2017		10.1145/3081333.3089317	latency (engineering);wireless network;redundancy (engineering);real-time computing;cloud computing;computer science;vehicular communication systems;cellular network	Mobile	-14.340082493065632	98.97681961840863	92705

Basically, both the high-speed broadband network platform and the effective multimedia application platform are needed to gain and promote the benefit of multimedia services to end-users. The ATM-based broadband network would be an adequate inter-network platform for multimedia communication. In general, different application platforms will be needed for different traffic requirements. In multimedia applications, a hybrid service is essential for supporting real-time traffic and non-real-time traffic simultaneously, for example in a conference call, data and voice have to be transferred at the same time. The goal of this paper is to design a framework which can support PBX services with multicasting capability for TCP/IP running over Internet and provide portability to the upper-layer distributed applications. A model of the hierarchical service architecture is proposed to solve the problem of QoS for end-users. Finally, we build an agent-oriented framework for distributed switching Agent with object caching mechanism to provide the capability of having a better deployment to clients.	atm turbo;distributed computing;distributed switching;internet access;internet protocol suite;multicast;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;requirement;software deployment	Rong-Tsung Sheu;Jean-Lien C.

Hence, understanding the characteristics of the YouTube traffic generation pattern can provide a significant advantage in predicting user video quality and in enhancing network design. In this paper, we present a characterisation of the traffic generated by YouTube when accessed from a regular PC. On the basis of this characterisation, a YouTube server traffic generation model is proposed, which, for example, can be easily implemented in simulation tools. The derived characterisation and model are based on experimental evaluations of traffic generated by the application layer of YouTube servers. A YouTube server commences the download with an initial burst and later throttles down the generation rate. If the available bandwidth is reduced (e.g. in the presence of network congestion), the server behaves as if the data excess that cannot be transmitted because of the reduced bandwidth were accumulated at a server's buffer, which is later drained if the bandwidth availability is recovered. As we will show, the video clip encoding rate plays a relevant role in determining the traffic generation rate, and therefore, a cumulative density function for the most viewed video clips will be presented. The proposed traffic generation model was implemented in a YouTube emulation server, and the generated synthetic traffic traces were compared with downloads from the original YouTube server. The results show that the relative error between downloads from the emulation server and the original server does not exceed 6% for the 90% of the considered videos.

The Satellite Digital Multimedia Broadcasting (S-DMB) system provides high quality audio, video and data broadcasting services to handheld and mobile receivers. S-DMB is a personal digital media which can provide bidirectional and interactive services via the convergent platform of broadcasting and communication. At present, TU Media, the only S-DMB service provider in Korea, provides 15 TV channels, 19 audio channels, and 3 data channels. The number of subscribers is about 890,000 by Nov. 2006. Thousands of low power gap fillers (repeaters) have been installed in the shadowed or blocked reception areas in the metropolitan Seoul. This paper presents the system requirements, standards and specifications, architecture, and service status of S-DMB in Korea. Comparisons with other satellite broadcasting systems and the services are also presented.

However, different from the bitstream-based evaluation models, the planning models are not allowed to exploit the video streams, with only limited information available for use, i.e., a few general parameters predetermined by the service providers and network operators. In this paper, a parametric planning model combining channel and video characteristics is proposed to estimate the video distortion caused by packet loss for Internet protocol television (IPTV) services. More specifically, the probability distribution of the channel states is determined by detailed analysis of the channel characteristics. Then, considering the influence of burst packet loss and the temporal dependence between frames, several sequence-level and frame-level parameters for video quality evaluation are derived from the perspective of the probability distribution of the channel states. Utilizing these parameters, the proposed model approximates the video quality considering the effects of direct packet loss and error propagation. Experimental results show that the proposed model has a superior performance for video quality estimation than the three commonly used parametric planning models.	bitstream;distortion;iptv;network packet;propagation of uncertainty;software propagation;streaming media;telecommunications network	Jiarun Song;Fuzheng Yang;Yicong Zhou;Shan Gao	2017	IEEE Transactions on Multimedia	10.1109/TMM.2016.2638621	media delivery index;planning;distortion;telecommunications;computer science;video quality;multimedia;rate–distortion optimization;packet loss;computer network	Metrics	-8.868957065021425	101.30656772813495	93631

The evolution path through the generations is explored in three steps at each level: first, the new network elements supporting localization features are introduced; then, the standard localization methods are described; finally, the protocols providing specific support to mobile station positioning are studied. To allow a better understanding, this paper also brings a brief review of the cellular networks evolution paths.

This problem differs from traditional non-realtime error control problem in which a late arrival packet can seriously degrade the video playback quality. It is interesting to notice that if a lost packet is detected while the client buffer is running at a high position, then the probability to recover the lost packet is also high. In this paper, we present a new error control algorithm, called BREC(Buffer-controlled Retransmission-based Error Control), to dynamically control the buffer running at a specific level. By the experiments on a true VOD system in which we implement the BREC scheme, the packet loss rate can be reduced by an order of magnitude. We also show that the performance can be further improved by detecting the rate of changes in running buffer positions and use it to enhance the ability of buffer position control. Both analytical model and experimental results show that our mechanism significantly decrease packet loss and improves QoS even if a client, such as set-top box, PDA (Personal Data Assistant) or cellular phone, preserves only a limited amount of playback buffer (200K bytes of memory is used in our experiments).

A possible optical solution to resource contention is based on the use of switching matrices suitably connected with optical delay lines. Signalling could be dealt with using subcarrier multiplexing of packet headers. Synchronization could take advantage of clock tone multiplexing techniques, digital processing for ultra-fast clock recovery, and new distributed techniques for global packet-slot alignment. To explore the practical feasibility and effectiveness of these key techniques, a consortium was formed among the University of Massachusetts, Stanford University, and GTE Laboratories. The consortium, funded by ARPA, has three main goals: investigating networking issues involved in optical contention resolution (University of Massachusetts), constructing an experimental contention-resolution optical (CRO) device (GTE Laboratories), and building a packet-switched optical network prototype employing a CRO and novel signaling/synchronization techniques (Stanford University). This paper describes the details of the project and provides an overview of the main results obtained so far.		Imrich Chlamtac;Andrea Fumagalli;Leonid G. Kazovsky;Paul Melman;William H.

Mobile ATM provides generic mobility management and QoS-based transport capabilities suitable for integration of multiple radio access technologies including cellular voice, wireless data, and future broadband wireless services. The architecture of a mobile ATM network is outlined in terms of the newly-defined “W-UNI” interface at the radio link and “M-UNI” and “M-NNI” interfaces within the fixed network. The concept of a “proxy-UNI” interface which supports unified access for WATM and non-ATM mobile terminals through corresponding interworking functions (IWF) is explained, leading to an understanding of how different radio access technologies are supported by the same ATM-based core network infrastructure. Generic mechanisms for handoff and location management within the core mobile network are discussed, and related protocol extensions over the “W-UNI” and “M-UNI/NNI” interfaces are proposed. The issue of “crossover switch (COS)” selection in mobile ATM is considered, and a unified handoff signaling syntax which supports flexibility in COS selection is described. Typical signaling sequences for call connection and handoff using the proposed protocols are outlined. Experimental results from a proof-of-concept mobile ATM network prototype are presented in conclusion.	atm turbo;alternating turing machine;best-effort delivery;cos;coexist (image);communications protocol;connection-oriented communication;differentiated services;network packet;prototype;quality of service;radio access network;scalability;telecommunications network;third-generation programming language	Jun Li;Roy D.

The research in this field is important because it represents current trends on the use of iDTV opening many business opportunities. With the convergence of service providers, modern communication technologies and consumer electronics devices at home, new iDTV applications have emerged, particularly those that use the set-top-boxes (or digital TV sets) processing power to provide additional services, which extends the possibilities of interaction between the user and the connected home. To implement this platform, a known model, which considers aspects of the Ginga middleware and the Open Services Gateway Initiative (OSGi) framework, was used. The idea behind the API model is to export service objects from one side to another, allowing the development of two types of applications: the first one on the Ginga-J machine and the last one on the Ginga-NCL machine. The main goals of this paper are (i) presenting the use of free tolls to perform such integration and (ii) showing the most relevant aspects in the core of the two models. Finally, a basic step-by-step process is shown in order to build integrated iDTVHN real applications using this platform.	application programming interface;bridging (networking);ginga-j;middleware;nested context language;osgi	Vicente Ferreira de Lucena;Nairon S.

However, to provide prepaid services effectively, credit-control should have minimal latency. In an endeavor to support real-time credit-control for Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6), we design an architecture model of credit-control authorization. The proposed integrated model combines a typical credit-control authorization procedure into the MIPv6 authentication procedure. We implement it on a single server for minimal latency. Thus, the server can perform creditcontrol authorization and MIPv6 authentication simultaneously. Implementation details are described as software blocks and units. In order to verify the feasibility of the proposed model, latency of credit-control authorization is measured according to various Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) authentication mechanisms. The performance results indicate that the proposed approach has considerably low latency compared with the existing separated models, in which credit-control authorization is separated from the MIPv6 authentication.	authorization;embedded system;extensible authentication protocol;mobile ip;next-generation network;real-time clock;real-time computing;server (computing);software deployment	HyunGon Kim;ByeongKyun Oh	2005		10.1007/11552055_25	data authentication algorithm;feasibility study;real-time operating system;computer access control;telecommunications;computer science;authentication protocol;operating system;internet authentication service;lightweight extensible authentication protocol;authentication;computer security;email authentication;computer network	Security	-13.50757302122745	95.79791276478232	95057

The MPS design challenges are two-fold. First, human preferences are concurrently dominated by multiple quality attributes of the streaming media whose perceptual tradeoffs were not well understood, so they were not used as an integral part of an efficient MPS design. Second, people's perceptions can be impacted by the flicker effect caused by Internet dynamics and the resulting MPS adaptations. In this paper, we propose a new and adaptive perception-based MPS scheme to deliver high-quality real-time interactive multimedia. We first investigate the perceptual tradeoffs among the multi-modal bundle streaming qualities in a real Internet environment. We then present our MPS design that finds the bundle quality tradeoffs, while minimizing flicker degradations. Evaluation results show the performance of our MPS scheme.	flicker (screen);floor and ceiling functions;interactivity;list of system quality attributes;modal logic;playout;polynomial-time approximation scheme;real-time clock;real-time transcription;scheduling (computing);streaming media	Zixia Huang;Klara Nahrstedt	2012	2012 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM	10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195700	real-time computing;the internet;simulation;media;computer science;multimedia;interactive media;perception	Visualization	-8.47989747124084	100.80039743479186	95197

It becomes the main challenge to design a network to achieving these QoS objectives. In this paper, a priority-based cross-layer quality-of-service (QoS) scheme for wireless channel and video applications was introduced. The application layer sends an inquiry to examine the link state. Respectively, the link layer feedbacks a trigger to indicate the state of link information. On the other hand, unequal error protection was adapted for retransmission decision. When a packet was dropped, ARQ decision will be make according to the priority-based adaptive QoS of MPEG-4 video streams. Simulation results demonstrate that video processed in cross-layer scheme experiences much better than that of traditional scheme, not only in PSNR but also in visual quality.	link-state routing protocol;network packet;peak signal-to-noise ratio;quality of service;retransmission (data networks);simulation;streaming media	Zemin Ma;Jinhe Zhou;Tonghai Wu	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Information Security	10.1109/WCINS.2010.5543738	real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	-6.272182855783611	101.2302116269556	95316

The following key aspects are addressed: 1) ring topology and wiring, 2) transmission, and 3) ring synchronization with phase-locked loops. Wiring of a ring is based on a two-level hierarchy with passive wiring concentrators placed at convenient locations in a building. Data are transmitted with differential Manchester code. Special emphasis is placed on the synchronization methods and on the parameters and tolerances which limit distance and number of stations that can be attached to a ring. An analysis of the behavior of a chain of repeaters under growing jitter is given. Also the various procedures for guaranteeing high reliability are outlined. An experimental token ring has been running since 1981, and has been tested extensively under extreme jitter and noise conditions.	token ring	Heinz J. Keller;Heinrich Meyr;Hans R.

Real-time media such as video requires delay constraints from the network to ensure good quality at the receiver. While watching a video stream on his portable device connected to the Internet through the last-hop wireless link, the mobile user of tomorrow will expect a good experience. But, the time-varying nature of the wireless link can cause video frames to be dropped/delayed, affecting the quality of video at the receiver. In this paper, we propose a link layer approach to improve the quality of MPEG video streaming over a wireless link. We use Bluetooth as the wireless technology on which to test our scheme. Our results show that the quality of streaming video can be substantially improved with our scheme, particularly in bad channel conditions.	bluetooth;frame (video);internet;mobile device;moving picture experts group;real-time transcription;streaming media	Rohit Kapoor;Matteo Cesana;Mario Gerla	2003		10.1109/ICCCN.2003.1284212	link layer;real-time computing;the internet;uncompressed video;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;video tracking;bluetooth;visual communication;computer network	Mobile	-6.949144191161454	99.801154133832	95847

Architectures, protocols, and information models have been proposed as a way to better respond to the new and different demands of global networks. However this offer also leads to a growing complexity of management solutions and to an increase in systems' requirements. The current management landscape is populated with a multiplicity of protocols, initially developed as an answer to different requirements. This paper presents a comparative study of currently common management protocols in All-IP networks: SNMP, COPS, Diameter, CIM/XML over HTTP and CIM/XML over SOAP. This assessment was focused on wireless aspect issues, and as such includes measures of bandwidth, packets, round-trip delays, and agents' requirements. We also analyzed the advantages of compression in these protocols.	computer-integrated manufacturing;diameter (protocol);global network;hypertext transfer protocol;information model;population;requirement;soap;simple network management protocol;xml	Pedro Gonçalves;José Luís Oliveira;Rui L.

These systems rely on the voluntary participation of the peers to help each other and reduce congestion at the data servers. BitTorrent is a popular file-sharing P2P application originally designed for non real-time data. With minor modifications concerning the peer selection among others, it can also be used for real-time applications. One major issue that impacts the performance of these networks is related to the fact that it is not uncommon to find users that have initiated a file transfer and decide to leave the system before the end of the download or when seeds leave the system shortly after downloading the complete file. In this work, a priority-based scheme for streaming stored playback video-on-demand services in window-based peers selection strategy in P2P networks is proposed. The priority scheme benefits the peers that are more likely to remain longer in the system by serving them first over peers that are statistically more likely to abort the download. The window-based peer selection strategy allows an efficient mechanism to select the downloader peers according to their progress in the file download process relative to the progress of the downloading peers. The aforementioned strategy is analyzed using both a fluid model and a Continuous Time Markov Chain. Also, abundance conditions in the system are identified.	bittorrent;distributed computing;download;file sharing;file transfer;markov chain;network congestion;peer-to-peer;real-time data;real-time transcription;seeds (cellular automaton);server (computing);upload	Edgar Baez Esquivel;Mario E.

Nevertheless it has not spread significantly in daily use. Some of the problems rely on the infrastructure needed to set up a video session: one or more ISDN lines or a fast Internet connection. The first is not easily available everywhere in a building; the latter is rarely so fast to allow for a smooth operation with no quality drops. The use of Videonet, the first European commercial public Internet link with guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS), has the potential to be a breakthrough in videoconferencing. We describe this new system and its applications, with the first tests in a hospital environment. Our results show that there are still problems to be solved in order to achieve a quality comparable to ISDN.	emergency medical service;hospitals;isosorbide dinitrate;multicast;quality of service	Michele Crudele;Giuseppe Cinque;Giovanni Neglia;Giuliano Razzicchia;Marco Venditti	2001	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-60750-928-8-8	simulation;computer science;multimedia;computer network	Web+IR	-11.623903102902887	95.9202605543692	96537

However, it is not easy for mobile users to run any application on any device without there being a negative impact in the quality of the application since different applications, content, networks and devices each have varying properties. Such variety can result in a mismatch between the application and the mobile device, and as a result, the application quality cannot be guaranteed for each user. To solve this problem, a context-aware matching system is proposed to improve user-perceived quality in heterogeneous wireless networks. The proposed system allows for applications to be easily used on a suitable mobile device by optimally matching an application to the given mobile device and controlling the quality of the content in the media application on the basis of contextual information. The results of the implementation show that the proposed context-aware matching system can match applications well to the recommended mobile devices. In addition, the proposed system significantly improves the user-perceived quality of applications by adaptively transmitting the corresponding media content.	application programming interface;drag and drop;mobile device;open api;transmitter;universal plug and play	Dongchil Kim;Jiwoo Park;Seung Woo Kum;Kwangsue Chung	2015	IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics	10.1109/TCE.2015.7389809	real-time computing;mobile search;media;mobile web;quality of service;computer science;mobile technology;internet privacy;mobile computing;bandwidth;computer network	Mobile	-11.156629194971892	99.92763842635587	96623

Accordingly, several approaches to overcome this issue have been discussed in literature. This paper presents a novel software payload encoding scheme, which is able to guarantee that no stuff bits will ever be added to the data field by the CAN controller during transmission and, hence, lessens jitters considerably. Particular care has been put in its practical implementation and its subsequent evaluation to show how the simplicity and inherent high performance of the scheme make it suitable even for low-cost, embedded architectures.	backward compatibility;byte;can bus;clock synchronization;codec;coexist (image);control system;embedded system;general-purpose modeling;identifier;line code;memory footprint;message authentication code;microcontroller;requirement	Gianluca Cena;Ivan Cibrario Bertolotti;Tingting Hu;Adriano Valenzano	2013	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10.1109/TII.2013.2240310	control engineering;embedded system;synchronization;real-time computing;jitter;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;control theory;encoding;computer network	Embedded	-5.733085521720988	100.0211386801116	96902

A key success factor is to respond to customers' desires to choose the billing scheme that suits their needs, to subscribe to all services as a service package, and to pay for them via a single bill regardless of service type, service location, service providers and network operators. Furthermore, customers may want to choose their services and compose a package dynamically without paying attention to the billing scheme used. The main premise of this paper is that pre-paid and post-paid billing schemes will merge and customers will use services according to their account balance and credits, as opposed to their billing scheme. The requirement on service providers is to use OSS (operations support system) functions and the accompanying information model to support diverse pricing and billing schemes, which is a complex task. This paper presents key OSS functions and an information model that tackle this complexity. Challenges are described and requirements are defined. Related efforts are highlighted, and the context surrounding this work is laid out in detail. Finally, individual entities of information model and OSS functions are defined and an example using flow-chart to illustrate interaction of functions is presented.	coherence (physics);coherent information;control function (econometrics);electronic billing;entity;federation (information technology);flowchart;information model;middleware;open sound system;real-time transcription;real-time web;requirement;technical standard	Bharat Bhushan;Jane Hall;Pascal Kurtansky;Burkhard Stiller	2005	2005 9th IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management, 2005.

Operating on top of UDP, CoAP must handle congestion control by itself. The core CoAP specification defines a basic congestion control mechanism, but it is not capable of adapting to network conditions. However, IoT scenarios exhibit significant resource constraints, which pose new challenges on the design of congestion control mechanisms. In this article we present CoCoA, an advanced congestion control mechanism for CoAP being standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force CoRE working group. CoCoA introduces a novel round-trip time estimation technique, together with a variable backoff factor and aging mechanisms in order to provide dynamic and controlled retransmission timeout adaptation suitable for the peculiarities of IoT communications. We conduct a comparative performance analysis of CoCoA and a variety of alternative algorithms including state-of-the-art mechanisms developed for TCP. The study is based on experiments carried out in real testbeds. Results show that, in contrast to the alternative methods considered, CoCoA consistently outperforms the default CoAP congestion control mechanism in all evaluated scenarios.	algorithm;backoff;constrained application protocol;control system;experiment;fairness measure;internet of things;linux;network congestion;olami–feder–christensen model;recovery time objective;representational state transfer;retransmission (data networks);testbed;throughput	August Betzler;Carles Gomez;Ilker Demirkol;Josep Paradells Aspas	2016	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2016.7509394	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;internet of things;slow-start;computer network	Networks	-4.861413168449284	93.12645043249191	96955

The IGMP multicast membership management protocol is considered as inappropriate for multicast group management over satellite network. In fact, IGMP leads to flooding, latency and scalability issues when used over asymmetric satellite networks. Thus, we propose a new architecture for multicast services provisioning based on IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) as a service delivery platform. The interworking between IP multicast protocol (i.e., IGMP) and IMS protocol (i.e., SIP) is demonstrated to overcome these multicast scalability issues inherent to satellite networks. Implementation and deployment of the proposed platform over an advanced satellite network emulator is also described.	aaa (video game industry);authentication;authorization;emulator;ip multimedia subsystem;itil;interoperability;multicast;provisioning;quality of service;scalability;software deployment	Toufik Ahmed;Ismail Djama;Abdelhamid Nafaa;Patrick Gelard;Christophe Donny;Moueza Jérôme	2007	2007 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2007.4393991	igmp snooping;local management interface;multicast;ip multicast;inter-domain;reliable multicast;telecommunications;mbone;protocol independent multicast;computer science;service delivery framework;optical ip switching;pragmatic general multicast;internet group management protocol;distributed computing;ip tunnel;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;multimedia broadcast multicast service;ip multimedia subsystem;communications satellite;xcast;computer network;multicast address	Networks	-13.649850619874185	91.07155740268492	97138

For meeting the increased demands, new technologies such as relays in device‐to‐device communication and small cell access points have been introduced. However, these introductions have opened up security issues in the 5G wireless communication networks. This article focuses on security issues of the 5G wireless communication networks and analyzes the effect of a bandwidth spoofing attack using game theory on the small cell access point in 5G wireless communication network.

Many P2P streaming applications further provide users with DVD-like operations: play, pause, chapter selection, fast-forward, and rewind. Such a real-time interactive multimedia streaming is commonly referred to as the P2P Video-on-Demand (VoD). To further improve the streaming quality, recent research employs network coding as the key enabling technology. However, the practicality and implementation challenges of network coding received very little attention. In this paper, we present a practical implementation of network coding in a P2P VoD system, VoD+NC, based on which we conduct a measurement study on the actual performance gain provided by network coding. In the meantime, we identify design pitfalls when incorporating network coding into a P2P VoD system. Our study shows that, unlike P2P live streaming, directly applying network coding to a P2P VoD system does not necessarily lead to an immediate improvement in playback quality. With the proper configuration, network coding not only brings the same benefits as it does in P2P live streaming, but also better accommodates the asymmetric interests among peers and simplifies the neighbourhood management.	asynchronous circuit;fast forward;hard disk drive performance characteristics;linear network coding;media controls;peer-to-peer;real-time transcription;streaming media	Saikat Sarkar;Mea Wang	2012	2012 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems	10.1109/MASCOTS.2012.54	communications protocol;linear network coding;computer science;multimedia;world wide web;bandwidth;encoding;statistics;computer network	OS	-7.277425653062645	101.1026745322633	97410

As current 4G networks are nearing their capacity, there is growing interest for the inclusion of new spectrum bands for LTE networks, among which unlicensed spectrum features prominently. Coexistence issues are all but certain, especially in the 5 GHz unlicensed band, where incumbent, ubiquitous WiFi devices are likely to be affected. Many coexistence solutions are currently being investigated, at both physical and MAC layer. In this work, we explore the impact of a MAC-layer solution that is supposed to allow graceful co-channel coexistence, finding that there are indeed some cases where, depending on the choice of parameters and configuration, the performance of WiFi traffic can be seriously degraded.	aggregate function;chipset;cloud computing;coexist (image);compaq lte;futures studies;smartphone;streaming media;timeline	Claudio Casetti	2016	2016 13th IEEE Annual Consumer Communications & Networking Conference (CCNC)	10.1109/CCNC.2016.7444841	telecommunications;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-18.059798483304185	95.94766370359044	97517

However, one of its key limitations in achieving reliability and quality-of-service (QoS) for streaming services is the hierarchical error propagation caused by its tree structure. As a solution to this error propagation problem, we propose an unequal error recovery (UER) scheme where we apply different number of retransmissions to the different levels of the ALM tree. The error recovery scheme is implemented using reliable-UDP (RUDP). For each node of the ALM tree, the optimal number of the maximum retransmissions that minimizes the residual loss rate is obtained using Lagrange theory for a given delay constraint. Compared to the equal error recovery scheme where the equal number of maximum retransmissions is applied throughout the ALM tree, the proposed UER scheme shows up to 10% improvement in residual loss rate while maintaining acceptable delay overhead for real-time streaming applications.	baseline (configuration management);error detection and correction;multicast;network packet;optimization problem;overhead (computing);propagation of uncertainty;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time transcription;retransmission (data networks);simulation;software deployment;software propagation;tree structure	Joonhyoung Lee;Youngha Jung;Yoonsik Choe	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-72590-9_97	real-time computing;multicast;quality of service;computer science;propagation of uncertainty;distributed computing;tree structure;application lifecycle management;statistics;computer network	Metrics	-6.438290512694592	101.9744078928265	97551

The first part of this document deals with the general requirements of the B-ISDN signalling system, analyzing the new call and connection control concepts and giving some guide-lines for a modelling activity. Considerations for a long-term signalling system, which will have to handle a multiplicity of services, are also presented: multimedia services, complex call configurations, transitions among them during the lifetime of a call, and re-configurations of attributes values for a connection are described. The second part proposes some basic issues for a preliminary example of signalling system which handles ATM point-to-point connections between two users or between a user and aspecialized node, supporting services which require centralized resources within the network, such as connectionless or multimedia services.	atm turbo;centralized computing;cisco lan2lan personal office for isdn;connectionless communication;integrated services digital network;point-to-point protocol;requirement;telecommunications network	Alfredo Biocca;Enzo Contini;Giorgio Fioretto;Luciano Piovano	1991	European Transactions on Telecommunications	10.1002/ett.4460020404	q.931;real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications;engineering	Networks	-16.584527886123666	93.79579658593246	97616

In our system, a video is encoded into multiple descriptions with each description having equal importance. We consider a heterogeneous system with peers having different uplink bandwidths. We design a distributed protocol in which a peer contributing more uplink bandwidth receives more descriptions and consequently better video quality. Previous approaches consider single-layer video, where each peer receives the same video quality no matter how much bandwidth it contributes to the system. The simulation results show that our approach can provide differentiated video quality commensurate with a peer's contribution to other peers.	differentiated service;multiple description coding;simulation;streaming media;telecommunications link;video	Zhengye Liu;Yanming Shen;Shivendra S.

872ce6b2c88da20a0387a66bdf8826524be2055a	standardisation roadmap for next train radio telecommunication systems		3GPP LTE Third Generation Partnership Project --- Long Term Evolution cellular system first studies started in 2004. The system was designed initially for public voice and data services. Its scope has enlarged later on, to encompass public safety services and Machine-Type Communications MTC. It targets now vehicular domain V2X. In parallel, studies for the next generation system, a.k.a 5G, have started recently in 3GPP. This next generation aims at including from its very beginning, requirements for broadband public access services, Internet of Things IoT and vertical sectors, the latter ranging from vehicular services to factory automation needs. In Europe, several initiatives are on-going at International Railway Union UIC, European Railway Agency ERA and ETSI European Telecommunications Standards Institute to prepare the next train radio telecommunication system that would fit rail community requirements in replacement of GSM-R Global System for Mobile communications - Railways. Evolutions of 3GPP LTE are candidates, but 5G could jump in the list. This paper aims at providing an overview of current 3GPP status and roadmap toward 5G, and its level of compatibility with next train radio telecommunication system.

To preserve flexibility while reducing end-to-end latency, Hybird ARQ (HARQ) has been proposed as an alternative that combines the advantages of FEC and ARQ. This paper presents Cooperative Hybrid ARQ (CHARQ) that can further boost wireless video streaming quality. CHARQ takes advantage of the fact that, in the wireless environment, broadcast is free (from the sender's point of view) and that errors are location dependent so an intermediate proxy that overhears the source's transmission may transmit on behalf of the source to increase throughput efficiency. Simulation results show improved performance with the aid of cooperative proxies.	end-to-end principle;forward error correction;hybrid automatic repeat request;network packet;simulation;streaming media;throughput	Mei-Hsuan Lu;Peter Steenkiste;Tsuhan Chen	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo	10.1109/ICME.2009.5202603	hybrid automatic repeat request;real-time computing;error detection and correction;stop-and-wait arq;selective repeat arq;telecommunications;computer science;go-back-n arq;automatic repeat request;statistics;computer network	Mobile	-6.145181709331414	102.28945053850117	98949

This paper proposes an adaptive provisioning mechanism that determines at regular intervals the amount of bandwidth to provision for each PHB aggregate, based on traffic conditions and feedback received about the extent to which QoS is being met. The mechanism adjusts to minimize a penalty function that is based on the QoS requirements agreed upon in the service level agreement (SLA). The novel use of a continuous-space, gradient-descent reinforcement learning algorithm, enables the mechanism to require neither accurate traffic characterization nor any assumptions about the network model. Using ns-2 simulations, we show that our algorithm is able to converge to a policy that provisions bandwidth to meet QoS requirements.	access network;aggregate data;algorithm;converge;differentiated services;gradient descent;hop;imperative programming;iterative method;network model;penalty method;per-hop behaviour;provisioning;quality of service;rl (complexity);reinforcement learning;requirement;service-level agreement;simulation;time complexity;weighted fair queueing	Timothy Chee-Kin Hui;Chen-Khong Tham	2003		10.1109/ICON.2003.1266241	gradient descent;intelligent network;real-time computing;scalability;index term;quality of service;differentiated service;computer science;penalty method;feedback;distributed computing;reinforcement learning;bandwidth;computer network	Networks	-5.59072658442723	95.62653637437211	99493

Caliper takes live packets generated on a host computer and transmits them onto a gigabit Ethernet network with precise inter-transmission times. Existing software traffic generators rely on generic Network Interface Cards which, as we demonstrate, do not provide high-precision timing guarantees. Hence, performing valid and convincing experiments becomes difficult or impossible in the context of time-sensitive network experiments. Our evaluations show that Caliper is able to reproduce packet inter-transmission times from a given arbitrary distribution while capturing the closed-loop feedback of TCP sources. Specifically, we demonstrate that Caliper provides three orders of magnitude better precision compared to commodity NIC: with requested traffic rates up to the line rate, Caliper incurs an error of 8 ns or less in packet transmission times. Furthermore, we explore Caliper's ability to integrate with existing network simulators to project simulated traffic characteristics into a real network environment.

It is not an easy task for the network service provider to guarantee the best user's Quality of Experience (QoE) in diverse networks with different access technologies. This requires an adaptive method that dynamically adapts the video quality service over HTTP according to time varying network conditions. In this paper, a client-based rate adaptive method is proposed that dynamically selects the appropriate video quality according to network conditions and user's device properties. The proposed method considers three important Quality of Service (QoS) factors that regulate the user's QoE for video streaming over HTTP, which are: Bandwidth, Buffer, and dropped Frame rate (BBF). The network bandwidth significantly affects the video service, as it directly reduces the client buffering that may result in pausing or stalling during video streaming. The proposed BBF method efficiently deals with sudden drop of network bandwidth by using the new bandwidth metric, and reduces its impact on the buffer level of the end user. The buffer length plays a vital role to handle the dynamic change in bandwidth. The dropped frame rate (fps) is another influential factor that minimizes the user's QoE. The proposed BBF algorithm is evaluated with different buffer length, and it is compared to Adobe's OSMF adaptive method.	algorithm;best bin first;client-side;hypertext transfer protocol;internet;network service provider;quality of service;scanline rendering;streaming media;time-varying network	M.

From the perspective of network users, lost packets are a waste of resources, and constitute additional burden on them. We use simulation to quantify the effect of packet losses on end-user cost in an internetwork consisting of transit domains with usage based charging policies. Our simulation shows that time based cost, packet based cost and byte based cost are differently affected by the changes in the packet loss probability of the inter-domain route. This will have implications for inter-domain routing protocols.	byte;inter-domain;internetworking;network packet;packet switching;routing;simulation	Brijesh Kumar	1993	Computer Communication Review	10.1145/165299.165301	source routing;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;packet loss;computer network	Networks	-7.750335218811859	90.13682477632616	100169

Of the same reason, the concept of multicast fairness is starting to attract attention, it might be sensible to give multicast flows higher priority and thereby create an incentive for the use of multicast transmission. Allocating link bandwidth in proportion to the logarithm of the number of receivers of a flow, which favors multicast flows without totally starving unicast flows, has been proposed in the work of A. Legout et al. (2001). That was however just as a bandwidth-allocation policy ran on the individual routers and not a definition of multicast fairness. To our knowledge, no one has yet come up with a definition of multicast fairness which prioritizes multicast flows. In this paper, we present a general multicast-fairness definition, named multicast-favorable max-min fairness (MFMF), which can be used together with any multicast-favorable function.	algorithm;fairness measure;max-min fairness;multicast;multistage interconnection networks;network packet;packet delay variation;real-time transcription;router (computing);streaming media;unicast	Tingting Zhang;Patrik Österberg;Youzhi Xu	2005	First International Conference on Distributed Frameworks for Multimedia Applications	10.1109/DFMA.2005.38	multicast;ip multicast;inter-domain;max-min fairness;reliable multicast;telecommunications;protocol independent multicast;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;internet group management protocol;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;multimedia broadcast multicast service;xcast;computer network;multicast address;bandwidth allocation	Networks	-6.483508224477438	95.63037736191137	100433

This approach proposes a modification to the Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 protocol. The goal of HMIPv6-BI is to minimize the Bandwidth usage of the Radio Link between the Access Router (AR) and the Mobile Node (MN). Currently, in HMIPv6 a tunnel is established between the Mobility Anchor Point (MAP) and the MN. By contrast, the principle used by HMIPv6-BI is to move the Tunnel End Point until the AR. In consequence, this method decreases the number of bytes traveling over the wireless interface due to the absence of the tunnel headers required in the original approach. Furthermore, HMIPv6-BI allows the usage of Multicast Tunnel (this approach is named TMCast+HMIPv6-BI) in order to reduce the Handover Latency. Finally, modeling and simulation results indicate that HMIPv6-BI provides better performance as compared to the standard approach.	byte;interrupt latency;mobile ip;multicast;router (computing);simulation	Line Becerra;Jhon Padilla;Josep Paradells Aspas	2008	2008 New Technologies, Mobility and Security	10.1109/NTMS.2008.ECP.16	telecommunications;computer science;manganese;operating system;modeling and simulation;distributed computing;bandwidth;mobile ip;computer network	Mobile	-10.792062113838703	89.51128809064244	100525

These new real-time Applications require a reliable performance of the network so as to provide a good Quality of Service (QoS) so it is important for the services providers to estimate the quality offered; and regardless of the transport network to know the quality perceived by the user. For this it is important to have tools to evaluate the quality of service provided. This paper presents a system for IPTV quality assessment. This will allow us to study the user's perceived quality for different codecs, bit rates, frame rates and video resolutions, and the impact of the network packet loss rate, in order to determine the objective and subjective quality. We propose an application simulating packet loss as a function of network parameters, which can be used to obtain the received video with different network impairments, without the need for transmitting it. It has two main advantages: first, it avoids the need of transmitting the video a number of times; second, it allows test repeatability.	codec;iptv;network packet;quality of service;real-time transcription;repeatability;simulation;software deployment;transmitter	Luis Casadesus;Julián Fernández-Navajas;Luis Sequeira;Idelkys Quintana Ramírez;Jose Saldana;José Ruíz	2012		10.1145/2382016.2382026	media delivery index;quality of service;telecommunications;engineering;multimedia;computer network	Networks	-8.967396400380457	100.204228731604	100779
d652e3185380bc73f4165755bcf5ad4081b8faba	comparison of coap and cocoa+ congestion control mechanisms for different iot application scenarios		CoAP is a web transfer protocol that provides basic RESTful services for IoT devices. Since CoAP operates on top of UDP, CoAP must support additional congestion control and reliability mechanisms. However, CoAP is originally designed to allow implementations that do not maintain any end-to-end connection information. Thus, the default congestion control mechanisms are not capable of adapting to network conditions. A few enhancements of the basic congestion control mechanism of CoAP have been recently proposed, and CoCoA+ is commonly considered the most mature of these proposals. However, the shortcomings of CoCoA+ have not been sufficiently investigated in the literature. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of the congestion control mechanisms of CoCoA+ and CoAP for a variety of traffic patterns under realistic IoT setups. The results of this evaluation indicate that CoCoA+ can perform significantly worse than default CoAP, especially with bursty traffic and in networks with few clients as a result of an improper selection of the retransmission timeouts. Furthermore, large variability of RTO values in CoCoA+ makes difficult to meet end-to-end delay requirements of typical IoT monitoring applications.	constrained application protocol;control system;end-to-end principle;heart rate variability;network congestion;recovery time objective;representational state transfer;requirement;retransmission (data networks)	Emilio Ancillotti;Raffaele Bruno	2017	2017 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)	10.1109/ISCC.2017.8024686	implementation;computer network;computer science;retransmission;network congestion;real-time computing;packet loss;internet of things	Networks	-4.8421822591679184	92.97605612848328	101014
9bbd1ec0c6d712fa00a90bcf4d9e6fbe2ebc9ae8	simultaneous output-timing control in networked games and virtual environments		In this chapter, we make a survey of techniques for simultaneous output-timing control, which adjusts the output timing of media streams among multiple terminals in networked games and virtual environments. When media units (MUs, each of which is the information unit, such as a video frame and a voice packet for media synchronization) are transmitted over non-guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS) networks like the Internet, the receiving times of each MU at the terminals may be different from each other owing to network delays and delay jitters. Therefore, for example, the fairness among players may be damaged in networked games, and collaborative work may not be done efficiently among users in virtual environments. It is important for multiple players/users to play/do networked games/collaborative work while watching the same displayed images simultaneously. To solve the problems, the simultaneous output-timing control, such as media synchronization control and causality control is needed. In this chapter, as the control, we mainly handle the group (or inter-destination) synchronization control, which is a type of media synchronization control, the adaptive Δ-causality control, and the dynamic local lag control. We also discuss the similarities and differences among the three types of control. Generally, the group synchronization control or adaptive Δ-causality control can be employed to keep the fairness and/or the consistency in good conditions among multiple terminals in networked games and virtual environments, and the dynamic local lag control is used for sound synchronization in networked virtual ensembles. However, the interactivity may seriously be deteriorated under such types of control. Therefore, we introduce prediction control to improve the interactivity. As a result of Quality of Experience (QoE) assessment, we demonstrate that the prediction control improves the interactivity and there is the optimum prediction time according to the network delay.

With the wide deployment of WiFi (e.g., home, vehicle, smartphones, laptops) and onboard unit (OBU) in automotive and public transportation systems (PTS), it is important to provide mechanisms that allows data offload and seamless handover of sessions between cellular-based vehicular networks (3G/4G) and WiFi as well as IP flow mobility for users in automotive and PTS. Such mechanisms will allow a better resource usage for network operators and guarantee higher QoS for users while considering value-added services in vehicular communication networks (VCNs). Although, several approaches have been proposed for mobility management such as Mobile IP (MIPv4 and MIPv6) and Network Mobility (NEMO), seamless mobility and efficient flow mobility are not guaranteed. This paper proposes a new mechanism for selective IP traffic offload (SIPTO) for VCNs. The proposed solution has been prototyped and the performance evaluation shows improvement in terms of throughput, energy consumption, and flow mobility latency when compared to existing mobility management approaches.	access network;data striping;embedded system;laptop;mobile ip;mobile data offloading;mobile device;performance evaluation;point-to-point protocol;proxy mobile ipv6;quality of service;scott continuity;seamless3d;smartphone;software deployment;tablet computer;telecommunications network;telematics;throughput	Christian Makaya;Subir Das;Fuchun Joseph Lin	2012	2012 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference Workshops (WCNCW)	10.1109/WCNCW.2012.6215518	routing;throughput;large segment offload;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;manganese;wireless network;public transport;mobility model;mobile computing;computer security;mobile ip;computer network	Mobile	-12.587307577649089	89.66433081261526	101189

In this article we explore the feasibility of utilizing a wireless network to reduce cabin wiring and reconfiguration costs and to provide passengers with a high-quality entertainment experience, including personalized video and audio as well as state-of-the-art computer games. The problem is to determine whether this is feasible given the computer system demands of state-of-the-art network-based games, combined with the design constraints imposed by the aircraft cabin environment and the bandwidth demands of streaming video. These constraints have both hardware and network design factors. In both cases, the study assumes functionality that would be commercially available in the 2008 timeframe and beyond. We develop several architectures, and through a combination of emulation and simulation, assess the viability of each alternative. We show that a highly distributed architecture, utilizing trends in mobile gaming devices and high-speed (802.11a/n) wireless LANs, together with MPEG-4 encoded video, yield a promising approach to providing passengers with a highquality entertainment.	computer;distributed computing;emulator;mobile game;network planning and design;network topology;pc game;personalization;simulation;streaming media;wiring	Dwayne Folden;Trent Jackson;Michael Panique;Rianon Tiensvold;Richard S.

This enables us to better understand how Quality of Service (QoS) parameters affect service quality, as it is actually perceived by the end user. Over the last years this goal has been pursued by means of subjective tests and through the analysis of the user's feedback. Existing statistical techniques have lead to poor accuracy (order of 70%) and inability to evolve prediction models with the system's dynamics. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for building accurate and adaptive QoE prediction models using Machine Learning classification algorithms, trained on subjective test data. These models can be used for real-time prediction of QoE and can be efficiently integrated into online learning systems that can adapt the models according to changes in the environment. Providing high accuracy of above 90%, the classification algorithms become an indispensible component of a mobile multimedia QoE management system.	algorithm;feedback;machine learning;quality of service;real-time clock;test data	Vlado Menkovski;Adetola Oredope;Antonio Liotta;Antonio Cuadra Sánchez	2009		10.1145/1821748.1821766	simulation;quality of service;computer science;multimedia;world wide web	SE	-9.59010005434547	99.98590617790089	101342

Here, each communication channel supports a different quality of service (QoS). In group communication, messages are required to be causally delivered. Even if a process supporting enough QoS receives messages, the process has to wait to deliver the messages until another process supporting lower QoS receives the messages in order to realize the atomic and ordered delivery of messages. Thus, multimedia data cannot be delivered to processes so as to satisfy the real-time constraint if a slower process is included in a group. We discuss group communication protocols by which multimedia messages can be delivered to a process with some time constraint properties which satisfy the QoS requirements of multimedia messages.	atomicity (database systems);causality;channel (communications);quality of service;real-time clock;requirement	Satoshi Itaya;Tomoya Enokido;Makoto Takizawa	2004	2004 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME) (IEEE Cat.

Two major principles introduced in the paper are: Multicast Logical IP subnet (MLIS) and Multiprotocol Over MLIS (MOM). The MLIS concept is defined over ATM in parallel with Classical LISs. MLIS dynamically includes all multicast capable hosts and statically includes all egress Mrouters with EARTH server being an ATMARP server for MLIS. MLIS spans the whole ATM cloud and therefore enables efficient short-cuts. Like IP Class D address which is not a """"true"""" IP address, MLIS is not a """"true"""" LIS, but an extension of LIS concept. The need for MOM is motivated by the following: separation of IP control and IP data flows is inevitable over ATM; control flows of multiple protocols tend to concentrate around ARP data. For IP multicast these protocols are: interdomain multicast protocols (like DVMRP); subnet group management protocol, Resource Reservation protocols (like RSVP). The EARTH server becomes a point of protocol attraction in MLIS."""	atm turbo;classful network;egress filtering;inter-domain;multicast;routing;scalability;server (computing);subnetwork	Michael I.

Most of deployments are based on client/server model in traditional SIP system. Especially, conferencing function is used for voice/video conference include file transfer and share remote applications through internet network. The conferencing system has an association between SIP user agents (Participants) and central point of control (Focus). The functionalities of SIP conference are organized in a centralized manner and heavily rely on dedicated servers. And it has some drawbacks to make the conferencing system is not reliable and scalable when participants increase. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) is another model different from client/server model. Every peer plays an equally important role in the network. P2P network is self-organized architecture, does not require any server in the network and hence make a good solution to those problems mentioned in above.  In this paper, we describe the architecture designed to construct Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network collaborating with existing traditional SIP for conferencing system. The details in this paper include the operations of how to create, join, leave and terminate the conference in P2P-SIP conference network. We have shown that our proposed scheme compared to other recently schemes is more attractive in terms of scalability (e.g. based on pure P2P), working with traditional SIP, as well as interactive communication approach for all SIP clients and extend function join our P2P-SIP conference.	centralized computing;client–server model;dedicated hosting service;file transfer;include directive;peer-to-peer sip;scalability;self-organization;server (computing);terminate (software);user agent	Karn Tirasoontorn;Sinchai Kamolphiwong;Sae-Wong Suthon	2008		10.1145/1506270.1506296	user agent;self-organization;sip trunking;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;peer-to-peer;distributed computing;session initiation protocol;videoconferencing;world wide web;computer security;communications system;client–server model;computer network	HPC	-16.068937847672082	93.55648329813637	101983

To operate such networks effectively, sufficient control over the communication system is needed, regarding, e.g., bandwidth usage, frame latency, and frame loss. In this paper, we present an approach for traffic shaping that applies a variant of the token bucket algorithm, and an approach for traffic monitoring in order to determine network overload. In particular, we introduce and apply a metric called unusable wasted bandwidth ratio, which is derived from the number of unusable wasted tokens to detect network overload locally. We have implemented both approaches on a commercial platform with WLAN adapters, and have conducted real experiments to assess their performance.	algorithm;automation;control system;core-based trees;experiment;noise shaping;routing;token bucket;traffic shaping;usability	Kiran Mathews;Christopher Kramer;Reinhard Gotzhein	2017	2017 IEEE 28th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2017.8292201	latency (engineering);computer network;automation;real-time computing;traffic shaping;communications system;computer science;wireless;leaky bucket;control system;token bucket	Embedded	-5.8168535918203705	97.32722732816146	102076

To figure out the latency reason and identify potential enhancement of FMIPv6, we analyze the handover latency of the predictive FMIPv6 from a cross layer perspective using data collected in a real IEEE 802.11 test-bed. We find that the key issues affecting the handover latency of the predictive FMIPv6 in IEEE 802.11 WLANs are the lack of assistance from the network entities, the ambiguous link layer triggering time and the inefficient interaction between the link layer and the network layer. And FMIPv6 can provide fast handover with no interruptions on the upper layer applications in IEEE 802.11 WLANs through some enhancements, which can resolve the above three issues.

These servers have heterogeneous streaming and storage capacities, and collaboratively share contents with each other. A critical challenge is how to optimize movie storage and retrieval so as to minimize system deployment cost due to server streaming, server storage, and network transmission between servers. Using a general and comprehensive cost model, we propose a novel VoD architecture using linear source coding. All the movies are source-encoded once at the repository, by coding k source symbols of movie m to n(m) source-coded symbols. These coded symbols are then distributed to the servers. We optimize n(m) and the number of symbols to retrieve from each server for a request. Our solution approaches asymptotically to global optimum as k increases. We show that even when k is low (say, 30), near optimality can be achieved. Furthermore, the solutions on n(m), symbol distribution and retrieval can be efficiently computed with a linear program (LP). Through extensive simulation, our algorithm is shown to achieve substantially the lowest cost, outperforming traditional and state-of-the-art heuristics by a significantly wide margin (by multiple times in many cases).	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;data compression;global optimization;heuristic (computer science);line source;linear programming;mega man network transmission;optimizing compiler;server (computing);simulation;software deployment;system deployment	Shueng-Han Gary Chan;Zhuolin Xu;Ning Liu	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)	10.1109/ICME.2013.6607448	real-time computing;computer science;linear programming;multimedia;world wide web;server;source code	DB	-7.688892367786932	103.45266390307013	102688

A virtual access point layer consisting of fixed virtual satellite network attachment points is superimposed over the physical topology in order to hide the mobility of satellites from the mobile endpoints. Then the MSN enhances endpoint mobility by a clean separation of identity and logical network location through an identity-to-location resolution service, and taking full advantage of the user's geographical location information. Moreover, a SDN based implementation is presented to further illustrate the proposal.	attachments;communication endpoint;geolocation;location (geography);network architecture;software-defined networking;wireless access point	Zhenning Zhang;Baokang Zhao;Zhenqian Feng;Wanrong Yu;Chunqing Wu	2016		10.1145/2973750.2985279	telecommunications;computer science;operating system;software-defined networking;mobility model;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-17.754265792759558	88.90349500928039	103052

6afb7ed3073f260793a87beda721a91802572aa0	a qoe aware lstm based bit-rate prediction model for dash video		Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) is becoming the de facto technology for live and on-demand video streaming services. This is primarily due to the flexibility it offers toward delivering satisfactory Quality of Experience (QoE) to a variety of end users over temporally varying unpredictable wireless channels. Although, the DASH framework provides the flexibility for selecting an appropriate bit-rate for each segment, however, it is still a challenging task to deliver a satisfactory QoE to the end user over entire video session. In this work, we present an efficient bit-rate prediction algorithm for the DASH framework that attempts to deliver high quality uninterrupted smooth video viewing experience to the end user. We have formulated the prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) due to its ability to provide good prediction output results in sequence learning. Experimental results reveal that the proposed prediction model is able to predict the bit-rate of the segments effectively and thus, deliver satisfactory QoE even in the face of highly varying channel conditions.	algorithm;display resolution;dynamic adaptive streaming over http;hypertext transfer protocol;long short-term memory;streaming media	Anirban Lekharu;Satish Kumar;Arijit Sur;Arnab Sarkar	2018	2018 10th International Conference on Communication Systems & Networks (COMSNETS)	10.1109/COMSNETS.2018.8328225	real-time computing;computer network;end user;dash;dynamic adaptive streaming over http;quality of experience;sequence learning;computer science;data modeling;communication channel	Visualization	-8.488640644368752	99.0674853416319	103673

Consequently, even small changes to TCP or to the network infrastructure can have significant impact on end-to-end performance, yet at the same time it is challenging for service administrators to predict what that impact will be. In this paper we describe the implementation of a tool calledMonkeythat is designed to help address such questions. Monkey collects live TCP trace data near a server, distills key aspects of each connection (e.g., network delay, bottleneck bandwidth, server delays, etc.) and then is able to faithfully replay the client workload in a new setting. Using Monkey, one can easily evaluate the effects of different network implementations or protocol optimizations in a controlled fashion, without the limitations of synthetic workloads or the lack of reproducibility of live user traffic. Using realistic network traces from the Google search site, we show that Monkey is able to replay traces with a high degree of accuracy and can be used to predict the impact of changes to the TCP stack.	end-to-end principle;google search;interaction;network packet;server (computing);synthetic intelligence;tracing (software);virtual reality;web service	Yuchung Cheng;Urs Hölzle;Neal Cardwell;Stefan Savage;Geoffrey M.

In this paper, we try to solve the problem by proposing a new communication architecture where a node has multiple IP addresses. Each IP address is used ``one-time,'' and valid only for a single session (e.g., TCP connection). We first analyze the architecture by itself from the technical viewpoint, and describe the detailed design including new concepts needed to realize. We then describe the technical descriptions of kernel/userland behavior in the proposed architecture.	multiplexing;server (computing);user space	Shingo Ata;Hiroshi Kitamura;Masayuki Murata	2011	2011 4th IFIP International Conference on New Technologies, Mobility and Security	10.1109/NTMS.2011.5721074	reserved ip addresses;ip hijacking;embedded system;virtual routing and forwarding;loose source routing;kernel;real-time computing;bogon filtering;the internet;next-generation network;telecommunications;ip address management;computer science;ip address spoofing;operating system;optical ip switching;ip forwarding;egress filtering;distributed computing;network address translation;ip tunnel;ip multimedia subsystem;multiplexing;telecommunications network;server;nat traversal;computer network	Arch	-19.74085335265754	88.88619828315215	103844

One of the promising solutions for the traffic explosion problem is the content centric networking (CCN), which solves the problem by focusing on the content instead of the location. Even though CCN can provide better delivery efficiency, robustness, security, and native subscriber mobility, little attention is paid to the publisher mobility problem, where the mobile devices produce the real-time traffic. In this paper, we propose PMC, a publisher mobility support protocol in CCN. By introducing two names and corresponding operations at the routers, PMC supports publisher mobility for the mobile video conferencing and broadcasting without violating the original CCN architecture. We believe that PMC is a validated and secured scheme following the philosophy of the CCN architecture to support mobile publisher.	cyclomatic complexity;indirection;mobile device;real-time transcription;router (computing);simulation;smart device	Dookyoon Han;Munyoung Lee;Kideok Cho;Ted Taekyoung Kwon;Yanghee Choi	2014	The International Conference on Information Networking 2014 (ICOIN2014)	10.1109/ICOIN.2014.6799694	communications protocol;the internet;teleconference;telecommunications;content management;computer science;electronic publishing;world wide web;computer network	Mobile	-11.260149275300437	90.7608144876957	104166

These include higher than necessary latency, wasted bandwidth, scalability bottlenecks, single points of failure, and increased complexity. The realization that handoff need not be the centerpiece of a network architecture when a large number of users are stationary and/or do not need to be reachable on externally initiated connections at a fixed IP address has led to recent proposals for flatter architectures where traffic is offloaded to a generic (not wireless specific) Internet Service Provider (ISP) at the closest possible opportunity to the wireless link. While these proposals do support mobility for flows ongoing at the time of handoff, tunneling traffic to and from the previous access router may lead to sub-optimal performance, efficiency, and reliability. In this paper, we outline a possible approach to the design of a wireless ISP that handles local mobility in a way that does not suffer from these drawbacks. Our solution is based on existing protocols commonly deployed in wireline ISPs, such as BGP, DHCP, and dynamic DNS update. Unlike existing approaches that use wireless-specific core network nodes such as SGSNs and GGSNs, our solution requires only modified mobile nodes and first-hop access routers, leaving the core network running unmodified, wireline-standard protocols.	border gateway protocol;network architecture;reliability engineering;router (computing);scalability;single point of failure;stationary process;tunneling protocol	Peter J.

133ee12af724a5560103f6a0b7e2d2a47b6da857	the pmipv6-based group binding update for iot devices		Internet of Things (IoT) has been booming with rapid increase of the various wearable devices, vehicle embedded devices, and so on, and providing the effective mobility management for these IoT devices becomes a challenge due to the different application scenarios as well as the limited energy and bandwidth. Recently, lots of researchers have focused on this topic and proposed several solutions based on the combination of IoT features and traditional mobilitymanagement protocols, in whichmost of these schemes take the IoT devices asmobile networks and adopt the NEtworkMObility (NEMO) and its variants to provide themobility support. However, these solutions are in face of the heavy signaling cost problem. Since IoT devices are generally combined to realize the complex functions, these devices may have similar movement behaviors. Clearly analyzing these characters and using them in the mobility management will reduce the signaling cost and improve the scalability. Motivated by this, we propose a PMIPv6based group binding update method. In particular, we describe its group creation procedure, analyze its impact on the mobility management, and derive its reduction ratio in terms of signaling cost.The final results show that the introduction of group binding update can remarkably reduce the signaling cost.	complex network;dna binding site;embedded system;group identifier;internet of things;proxy mobile ipv6;scalability;the open group;wearable technology	Jianfeng Guan;Ilsun You;Changqiao Xu;Hongke Zhang	2016	Mobile Information Systems	10.1155/2016/7853219	embedded system;simulation;telecommunications;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-12.434438292552256	88.61296447187446	104279

The network conveys various kinds of traffic to the users and different traffic classes always have different quality requirements. Therefore, it is a critical issue to allocate suitable network resource to suitable traffic class for better service quality provisioning and resource utilization. This paper considers the characteristics of video frames to forward the video packet in an efficient way. The proposed scheme properly utilizes the unused bits of the differential service (DS) field of the IP header to provide some heuristic information for packet early discarding. Thus, by using the opportunity random early dropping (RED) concept, the proposed packet correlated RED (PCRED) scheme refers the heuristic information to selectively drop useless packet that is not helpful for the improvement of receiving quality for better buffer and bandwidth utilization. Exhaustive simulations were conducted to compare the performance of the proposed scheme with the RED with in/out (RIO) and weighted RED (WRED) schemes. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme is superior to the other schemes for video streaming services.	algorithm;differentiated services;frame (video);heuristic;network packet;network performance;peak signal-to-noise ratio;provisioning;requirement;router (computing);simulation;streaming media;weighted random early detection	I-Hsuan Peng;Meng-Hsien Lin;Yen-Wen Chen;Fong-Ming Yang;Addison Y.

In practice, the accuracy of the estimated throughput is limited due to feedback delay and the unawareness of the dynamics of the underlying HTTP/TCP transport layer. As a result, streaming applications employ large playback delays in the order of tens of seconds so as to maintain continuous video rendering with good quality and bandwidth utilization. In this paper, we introduce DASP, an advanced video rate adaptation, to achieve a low-latency adaptive video streaming. The key components of our solution are a server-side mirroring of the streaming client's buffer, which provides a low-delay feedback for the video rate selection, and a hybrid rate adaptation logic based on goodput and buffer information, which stabilizes the adaptive response to the dynamics of transport layer. We demonstrate the performance of our rate selection algorithm by evaluating the stability of the receiver buffer under low-latency and high-definition adaptive video streaming with variable bit rate encoding over an emulated wide-area network link. The results also show that our approach is promising and applicable for dynamic live streaming with a playback delay as low as the chunk duration.	buffer overflow;disk mirroring;emulator;end-to-end principle;error detection and correction;fairness measure;goodput;hdmi;hypertext transfer protocol;network congestion;neural coding;scanline rendering;selection algorithm;server (computing);server-side;streaming media;throughput	Yongtao Shuai;Goran Petrovic;Thorsten Herfet	2014	2014 IEEE Fourth International Conference on Consumer Electronics Berlin (ICCE-Berlin)	10.1109/ICCE-Berlin.2014.7034271	real time streaming protocol;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	-6.412146082079951	99.03322234093625	104337

The demonstrator presents a solution to problems in current wireless networks, like inefficient radio spectrum usage and limited ability to withstand interferences. The presented spectrum-aware radio management framework flexibly negotiates transmission parameters based on spectrum usage and application requirements and opportunistically utilizes available bandwidth. A key feature of this demonstrator is the fact that it breaks the traditional fixed channel bandwidth limitation and enables dynamic bandwidth allocation according to the needs of applications. It continuously monitors the assigned spectrum, tracks application behaviour, and dynamically adapts to the radio environment, such as interference and competition. Furthermore, a cross-media roaming mechanism is provided in the framework to support seamless handovers within and between radio technologies. Our enhancements are transparent to upper layer applications and will automatically benefit any software using network resources. The presented demonstrator uses wireless video streaming in a typical household scenario to illustrate the benefits without changes to the multimedia applications.	agile software development;interference (communication);packet analyzer;propagation constant;requirement;seamless3d;streaming media	Zhou Wang;Ranveer Chandra;Thomas Moscibroda;Alain Gefflaut;Alexandre de Baynast;Paramvir Bahl	2009		10.1145/1530748.1530800	embedded system;spectrum;cognitive radio;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;operating system;wireless network;fixed wireless;wireless intrusion prevention system;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network;bandwidth allocation	Mobile	-11.85610348815561	92.47015152343874	104352

Our solution deals with the problem of the trade-off between link utilization and the quality of real-time service. We tested the proposed method using the emulation system, which consists of a streaming server, a network emulator and video receivers. As network emulator, the Berkeley's ns-2 simulator (working in emulation mode) was used. The streaming server and the video receiver were built on the base VLC software. The results of the experiment performed in the test environment show that the proposed solution ensures both satisfactory QoS for HD video and good link utilization.	best-effort delivery;deployment environment;emulator;experiment;provisioning;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time computing;server (computing);streaming media;transmitter;vlc media player	Robert R.

Our approach, which is implemented on a standard Linux platform, and which we call ADvanced Wi-fi Internet Service EnhanceR (ADWISER), is an extension of our previous system WLAN Manager (WM). ADWISER addresses several infrastructure WLAN performance anomalies such as mixed-rate inefficiency, unfair medium sharing between simultaneous TCP uploads and downloads, and inefficient utilization of the Internet access bandwidth when Internet transfers compete with LAN-WLAN transfers, etc. The approach is via centralized queueing and scheduling, using a novel, configurable, cascaded packet queueing and scheduling architecture, with an adaptive service rate. In this paper, we describe the design of ADWISER and report results of extensive experimentation conducted on a hybrid testbed consisting of real end-systems and an emulated WLAN on Qualnet. We also present results from a physical testbed consisting of one access point (AP) and a few end-systems.	call stack;centralized computing;emulator;internet access;linux;network packet;schedule (project management);scheduling (computing);testbed;upload;wireless access point	Malati Hegde;Pawan Kumar;K.

Therefore, it is worthwhile to enhance a subjective quality of video contents via ROI based coding. In this paper, An ROI/xROI based rate-control method is proposed, which considers the coding of both the ROI and the extended ROIs (xROI's) in non-ROI to meet given target bitrates. In the proposed method, the QP values are increasingly assigned in MB wide inside the non-ROI away from ROI. This reduces the abrupt change in visual quality and the amounts of residual signals along the border between ROI and non-ROI. In this regard, the subjective visual quality is enhanced as well as the proposed rate control has flexibility to control the amounts of the output bitstreams. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can more effectively achieve the average target bitrates with the better subjective quality than the existing rate control algorithm in H.264|AVC by reducing the variation of the output bitstream amounts.	algorithm;region of interest;videotelephony	Changhee Kim;Taeyoung Na;Jeongyeon Lim;Youngho Joo;Kimun Kim;Jaewoan Byun;Munchurl Kim	2009		10.1007/978-3-540-92957-4_88	simulation;multimedia	EDA	-7.286746319944906	100.28676783331518	104737

This is achieved by defining a new class of low mobility, static M2M devices which use a modified physical layer control frame structure.

Despite the characterization of media access patterns and user behaviors in many measurement studies, few studies have focused on the streaming techniques themselves, particularly on the quality of streaming experiences they offer end users and on the resources of the media systems that they consume. In order to gain insights into current streaming services techniques and thus provide guidance on designing resource-efficient and high quality streaming media systems, we have collected a large streaming media workload from thousands of broadband home users and business users hosted by a major ISP, and analyzed the most commonly used streaming techniques such as automatic protocol switch, Fast Streaming, MBR encoding and rate adaptation. Our measurement and analysis results show that with these techniques, current streaming systems these techniques tend to over-utilize CPU and bandwidth resources to provide better services to end users, which may not be a desirable and effective is not necessary the best way to improve the quality of streaming media delivery. Motivated by these results, we propose and evaluate a coordination mechanism that effectively takes advantage of both Fast Streaming and rate adaptation to better utilize the server and Internet resources for streaming quality improvement.	central processing unit;display resolution;internet;master boot record;self-hosting;server (computing);streaming media	Lei Guo;Enhua Tan;Songqing Chen;Zhen Xiao;Oliver Spatscheck;Xiaodong Zhang	2006		10.1145/1177080.1177108	quality management;in situ resource utilization;real time streaming protocol;computer science;multimedia;world wide web;computer network	Metrics	-8.85122080180516	98.57382788683721	104831

Inherent instabilities in the wireless medium lead to large, highly variable delay, throughput variations, and data loss. To cope with this problem the wireless MAC has incorporated many features such as reliability and aggregation. These features allow transport protocols such as TCP to work by hiding the frame losses from layers above the MAC. The problem is that in doing so they create overhead leading to loss of throughput. In this paper, we investigate a receiver side network stack design that allows these features to be switched off in the MAC. We instead provide reliability and aggregation features at the session layer. Our network stack design reduces the overhead cost significantly over MAC frame aggregation and increases throughput. We demonstrate the throughput advantages of our approach in testbed and emulation and analyze the effects of overhead created by our system.	acknowledgement (data networks);administrative domain;aggregate data;emulator;hypertext transfer protocol;object composition;overhead (computing);protocol stack;reliability engineering;retransmission (data networks);router (computing);server-side;software deployment;streaming media;testbed;throughput	Daniel M.

A single network, however, cannot meet the needs of all the different users in larger areas because of the limitations of the area it covers and the limited sharing of resources. Hence, many users have been asking for computer networks to be interconnected. We propose a scheme for interconnecting C-Net and Omninet, in which one C-Net and one Omninet station are used as half-gateways, connected by the standard interface RS232c. We successfully implemented inter-network high-level protocols for electronic mail and file transfer between C-Net and Omninet. This paper describes in detail the role of the two half-gateways, the interconnection level and design principles and the practical application of the method.	corvus systems	Xiong Yan;Kuo-Liang Chen	1989	Computer Networks	10.1016/0169-7552(89)90014-7	local area network;wireless wan;metropolitan area network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;law;computer network	Arch	-20.68399984616837	90.58975549702869	104905

Current website-based sharing services provide already means to share content to a group of other users, but it is not possible to share content with other mobile users at a competitive cost. The increasing use of mobile devices in our daily life will create demand for the new types of services in the usergenerated content field. This paper presents a personal mobile broadcasting system as an extension to the currently existing 3GPP MBMS system. A new user-level interface between the BM-SC and the personal mobile broadcaster is proposed. Also some new functionality, to be able to restrict the delivery only to a subset of user population, are presented in the paper.

Packet loss when transmitting compressed data has an effect on the delivered video quality that endures over multiple frames. To reduce the impact of radio frequency noise and interference, this paper proposes adaptive modulation based on content type at the video frame level and content importance at the macroblock level. Because the bit rate of protected data is reduced, the paper proposes buffer management to reduce the risk of buffer overflow. A trizone buffer is introduced, with a varying unequal protection policy in each zone. Application of this policy together with adaptive modulation results in up to 4 dB improvement in objective video quality compared to fixed rate scheme for an additive white Gaussian noise channel and around 10 dB for a Gilbert-Elliott channel. The paper also reports a consistent improvement in video quality over a scheme that adapts to channel conditions by varying the data rate without accounting for the video frame packet type or buffer congestion.	additive white gaussian noise;bluetooth;buffer overflow;data compression;data rate units;gilbert cell;information privacy;interference (communication);macroblock;modulation;network congestion;network packet;pixel;radio frequency;retransmission (data networks);server message block;streaming media;transmitter;uncompressed video;utility functions on indivisible goods	Rouzbeh Razavi;Martin Fleury;Mohammed Ghanbari	2008	EURASIP J.

In this respect, the virtual content delivery network (CDN) is perceived as a key enabler to circumvent the technical challenges faced by content providers to deliver high-quality content over the Internet. Here, the authors investigate how the two main actors of the video delivery chain--the CDN operator and the ISP--can benefit from network and server virtualization to negotiate dynamic service-level agreements that reduce CDN capital expenditures and operating expenses, while generating more revenue for the ISP. First, the authors present a dataset used to simulate dynamic distributed traffic consumption. Second, they discuss the steps required to deploy and operate a virtual CDN deployed on an ISP's network. Furthermore, they present evaluation results of the proposed solution, based on simple models. Lastly, they elaborate on operational parameters that are used to further optimize the solution.

d31f608c04efd44cb5a2dedba4bf142f01010128	mobility-based proactive multicast for seamless mobility support in cellular network environments		Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is receiver driven, asynchronous and location-independent, hence it natively supports client-mobility. However, post-handover delay is a problem for delay-sensitive mobile applications, as they need to (re-)submit their subscriptions and wait for them to get resolved and (probably re-) transmitted before receiving the demanded data. To avoid this problem and optimize performance, this paper proposes a Mobility-based Proactive Multicast (MPM) scheme. Unlike reactive or blind multicast solutions proposed in the past, MPM takes autonomous decisions locally at various network access points (cells) prior to the movement of mobile clients, using a semi-Markov mobility prediction model that predicts next-cell transitions, along with anticipating the duration between the transitions for an arbitrary user in a cellular network. Since cellular backhaul links are typically a bottleneck, MPM trades-off effectively part of the capacity of the (congested) backhaul link for a decreased delay experienced by users after handovers thanks to a congestion pricing scheme used for backhaul capacity allocation. Our preliminary performance evaluation results show that MPM captures well the temporal locality of mobile requests due to the semi-Markov mobility prediction model, hence it achieves a better performance compared to both a (i) blind/naïve multicast and a (ii) content popularity-based proactive multicast.	access network;asynchronous i/o;autonomous robot;backhaul (telecommunications);icn gps;internet protocol suite;locality of reference;markov chain;material point method;mobile app;multicast;naivety;network congestion;performance evaluation;proactive parallel suite;seamless3d;semiconductor industry;server (computing);wireless access point	Xenofon Vasilakos;Mohammed Al-Khalidi;Vasilios A.

In this paper, we present the phases of a SPIT management process and we form a set of SPIT identification criteria, which are needed in order to characterize a call as SPIT, or a caller as spitter. Then, we present briefly the currently existing anti-SPIT frameworks, so as to examine which of the SPIT identification criteria is fulfilled by each framework, thus providing an insight on which criteria a technique should cope with, as well as how one can evaluate and combine existing approaches, in order to effectively mitigate SPIT. Finally, we implement a list of the criteria in our lab environment in order to examine the applicability of these controls in a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) environment.

The interworking of these networks will enable access ubiquity, hence mobility, particularly vertical handover between the networks becomes topical. Thus, coordination within this diverse environment in terms of handover management is required to improve the handover performance. Furthermore, it is recommended to maintain simplicity in the resource-poor mobile devices and yet keep them powerful for efficiently running rich real-time multimedia applications during mobility. Thus, this paper motivates that the handling of handover operations must be kept in the network infrastructure. Consequently, the vertical handover mechanism introduced in the paper exploits the advantages of network-based mobility management in heterogeneous wireless networks and proposes the incorporation of a network-based handover coordinator to improve the handover performance between the networks in terms of handover delay and packet loss. After all, mobility management protocols do not support seamless handover on their own. The handover coordinator, therefore, ensures that the vertical handover between the networks is transparent to active connections during the handover period. Simulation results show the benefits of the handover coordinator to the network-based mobility management in a heterogeneous wireless access environment in terms of reduced handover delay and packet loss.	access network;interoperability;microsoft distributed transaction coordinator;mobile device;network packet;next-generation network;proxy mobile ipv6;real-time clock;seamless3d;simulation	Linoh A.

Future ITS stations complying with this set of standards deployed in vehicles, at the roadside infrastructures, and within the Internet are expected to communicate with each other through a combination of ITS dedicated communication protocols and legacy Internet protocols. However, in spite of the wide adoption of IPv6 for cooperative ITS communications, relatively little attention has been paid to the security issues related to IPv6 signaling and IPv6 transport communications. In this paper, we present our position on the emerging and urgent IPv6-related security issues that occur in communications between ITS stations complying with the ITS station reference architecture under standardization within ETSI TC ITS and ISO TC204.	communications protocol;internet protocol suite;reference architecture	Jong-Hyouk Lee;Thierry Ernst	2011	2011 IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference (VNC)	10.1109/VNC.2011.6117112	internet protocol;vehicular ad hoc network;reference architecture;communications protocol;telecommunications;computer science;dedicated short-range communications;security service;vehicular communication systems;computer security;computer network	HPC	-17.105342098012986	91.01773652372233	106937

In mobile surveillance networks, a cloud server collects videos delivered from multiple moving cameras and detects suspicious people in all the camera views. However, all the videos recorded by moving cameras such as phone or dash cameras are uploaded through bandwidth-limited wireless networks. Therefore, videos are required to be encoded with high compression ratio to satisfy the total data rate constraint, which may affect the video analyses (e.g., human detection/tracking and action recognition, etc.) performance due to the degraded video decoding qualities at the server side. In this paper, we propose an effective content-driven video source coding rate allocation scheme, which can improve the human detection success rate in mobile surveillance networks under a total data rate constraint. The proposed scheme allocates appropriate amount of data rate to each moving camera based on the corresponding content information (i.e., human detection results). A model of human detection accuracy based on object area and video quality is provided. The rate allocation problem is formulated as a convex optimization problem and can be solved by standard solvers. Simulations with real video sequences demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.	computer simulation;convex optimization;data compression;data rate units;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;server (computing);server-side;uncompressed video;video content analysis;video decoder;virtual private server	Xiang Chen;Jenq-Neng Hwang;Kuan-Hui Lee;Ricardo L. de Queiroz	2015	2015 IEEE 17th International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing (MMSP)	10.1109/MMSP.2015.7340838	computer vision;simulation;computer science;resource management;operating system;video tracking;multimedia;server	Vision	-7.3441747964503925	104.03392307466174	107039

The paper proposes an architecture to support seamless mobility of mobile networks across heterogeneous networks. We consider the vehicular scenario where a vehicle is provided with mobility through different internet service providers (ISPs) and propose to use multiple mobile routers-based handover scheme in vehicles. The multiple mobile routers architecture is extended to include multiple home agents (HAs) where each HA belongs to different administrative domains. We carry out comparative performance evaluation of the handover performance of the proposed scheme in regard to UDP and TCP throughput, service disruption time, and signalling overhead. Moreover, we analyse the impact of vehicle speed and overlapping distance of access routers on packet loss during handover period. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme provides a mobile network with seamless mobility across heterogeneous networks. The overlapped reception of packets from different access routers significantly minimises packet losses during handover even without reducing handover latency.	denial-of-service attack;fault tolerance;multihoming;network packet;next-generation network;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;proxy mobile ipv6;quality of service;router (computing);seamless3d;semantic network;simulation;throughput	Arun Prakash;Rajesh Verma;Rajeev Tripathi;Sagar Naik	2012	IJCNDS	10.1504/IJCNDS.2012.044320	embedded system;telecommunications;computer science;handover;operating system;soft handover;computer network	Mobile	-11.669748325692234	89.6607999531856	107242

An overview is given of a general architecture and language for policies. It is then shown how these are adapted for control of calls using the H.323 multimedia communications standard. Policy support for H.323 was created by extending an open-source gatekeeper. The core policy language has been specialised to deal with call control in general, and for H.323 in particular. Examples are given of policies for H.323, illustrating how traditional features can be made to work more flexibly through use of policies. Examples are also provided of policies specific to H.323, and policies that can take advantage of other information such as the context of a call.	authentication;communications server;gatekeeper;next-generation network;open-source software;private network;router (computing);semantic network;server (computing);tom;usability;user interface;wizard (software);xml	Tingxue Huang;Kenneth J.

The coordination between these two layers provides more robust media transmission even under severe network conditions. In this framework, a multiple description source coder is used to produce multiple independently-decodable streams that are routed over partially link-disjoint (non-shared) paths to combat bursty packet losses. We model multi-path streaming and propose a multi-path selection method that chooses a set of paths maximizing the overall quality at the client. Overlay infrastructure is then used to achieve multi-path routing over these selected paths. The simulation results show that the average peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) improves by up to 8.1 dB, if the same source video is routed over intelligently selected multiple paths instead of the shortest path or maximally link-disjoint paths. In addition to PSNR improvement in quality, the enduser experiences a more continual streaming quality.	computational complexity theory;graphics;heuristic (computer science);maximal set;molecular dynamics;multipath propagation;multipath routing;network congestion;network packet;overlay network;peak signal-to-noise ratio;requirement;shortest path problem;simulation;streaming media	Ali C.

This article focuses on the Layer 3 WMN, which provides the same service interfaces and functionalities to the conventional mobile host (MH) as the conventional wireless local area network. Three essential design issues to realize seamless mobility management in the Layer 3 WMN are identified and systematically discussed in this article. They are IP address resolution, location management, and Media Access Control (MAC) address resolution. The Layer 3 WMN backbone requires systematic management of the IP and MAC addresses of each MH, which can be realized by four basic approaches: centralized management, home management, replication management, and distributed management. It is shown that the address pair management architecture is fundamental to realizing efficient packet forwarding and address resolution. Design guidelines are provided to realize Layer 3 WMN supporting seamless MH roaming, considering the applicability of address pair management architectures with regard to WMN scale and client mobility; this applicability is considered based on a qualitative evaluation of the management overhead and handover performance.	access control;centralized computing;internet backbone;mac address;mesh networking;modified huffman coding;network packet;overhead (computing);seamless3d;wireless mesh network	Kenichi Mase	2011	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2011.5936169	telecommunications;ip address management;computer science;routing protocol;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-12.902568532229742	89.78688538560111	107701

In order to combat the variable network resources, rate adaptation is adopted to meet the transmission rate of the varying network. However, being a resource-intensive application, a key research problem of rate adaptation is to make the best of bandwidth and provide a relatively stable high-quality media service. Besides, in HTTP streaming, it is difficult to differentiate between the short-term throughput changes which incurred by the TCP congestion control, and the throughput changes due to persistent bandwidth changes. Therefore, this problem becomes more challenging. In this paper, we propose a rate adaptation solution for our distance education system based on HTTP Live Streaming (HLS). Firstly, our solution adopts a bandwidth prediction algorithm based on download throughput samples, it can effectively measure the available bandwidth by dividing the segment into duration. Secondly, the solution proposes a threshold-based rate adaptation algorithm. We adopt two thresholds to design our adaptive strategy according to the predicted bandwidth, it successfully keeps our average bit rate in a higher level and gets a decent bandwidth utilization. At the same time, it provides a relatively stable video quality. Simulation results show that the proposed rate adaptation algorithm can strike a balance between bandwidth utilization and stability of video stream under a varying bandwidth condition1.	algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);clock rate;download;http live streaming;high-level synthesis;hypertext transfer protocol;network congestion;push technology;simulation;streaming media;tcp congestion control;throughput;video	Bin Li;Qinghua Zheng;Weizhan Zhang	2013	2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications & 2013 IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing	10.1109/HPCC.and.EUC.2013.344	algorithm design;bandwidth management;throughput;real-time computing;media;telecommunications;network switch;computer science;bandwidth;dynamic bandwidth allocation;spectral efficiency;computer network	HPC	-7.0858151318078795	98.1913577163388	107737

Congestion-based pricing has been suggested as a method to target QoS in other network architectures. Here, we investigate whether congestion-based pricing can be used to control aggregate traffic into each codepoint by motivating users to choose the codepoints appropriate for each application. We first ask what information needs to be exchanged; we assert that both price and QoS information must be available for users to make decisions. We then ask how effective congestion-based pricing in diffServ can be; we find that it is feasible only for networks with sufficiently high bandwidth to guarantee that QoS can be quickly measured.	differentiated services;network congestion	Nan Jin;Scott Jordan	2008	IEEE/ACM Trans.

Specifically we evaluate how its overall capacity is shared between three basic MAC bandwidth components (load, access, and free) as the number of VoIP calls increases and how it influences transmission impairments (delay, loss, and jitter) and thus call quality. Resource utilization (under the MAC bandwidth components framework) is calculated by a WLAN probe application that passively """"sniffs"""" packets at the L2/MAC layer of the wireless medium and analyses their headers and temporal characteristics. The quality of VoIP calls is predicted using an extended version of the ITU-T E-model, which estimates user satisfaction from time varying transmission impairments. Through experimentation with various codecs and packetization schemes we found that as the load (number of calls) reaches the available capacity level, packet delays and jitter increase dramatically resulting in the call quality becoming degraded. We show how these MAC bandwidth components maybe used to assess the VoIP call quality on 802.11 WLANs"""	codec;experiment;network packet	Miroslaw Narbutt;Mark E Davis	2006	2006 International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks(WoWMoM'06)	10.1109/WOWMOM.2006.48	local area network;real-time computing;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;resource management;voice over ip;computer network;broadband networks	Embedded	-5.474813929623367	98.09363029527624	108548

The main objective is to allow video streaming applications to adapt its parameters according to 802.16MAC layer conditions and resource availability. For unicast traffic, we propose a cross layer optimizer, named XLO, between scalable video streaming application and IEEE 802.16 MAC layer. XLO uses the existing service flow management messages exchanged between a base station (BS) and a subscriber station (SS) and make them available to the video streaming application via a specific XLO interface. We implemented the XLO in the QualNet simulator and performed extensive simulations using a personalized scalable video traffic generator, capable of streaming video with different data rates and quality levels. We also introduce an enhanced admission control function at the BS that takes into account video adaptability property. The simulation results show the effectiveness of our XLO mechanism for delivering better quality of service. For multicast traffic, we propose a new solution based on superposition coding and make use of scalable video coding in order to optimize the network	asymmetric digital subscriber line;data compression;mathematical optimization;multicast;personalization;quality of service;scalability;scalable video coding;simulation;streaming media;unicast	Djamal-Eddine Meddour;Alaeddine Abdallah Djamal;Toufik Ahmed;Raouf Boutaba	2012	J.

The performance of the sensor network along with the 3.5G network is a critical factor for successful development of e-health services perceived by end-users. In this paper, we propose a methodology for performance assessment based on the joint uplink transmission of voice, realtime video, biological data, such us electrocardiogram, vital signals and heart sounds. Various scenarios were concerned for homecare patient applications in terms of real-time and non-realtime in random locations, where no other system but 3.5G is available. The accomplishment of quality of service (QoS) was explored through the delay and the jitter of the networks' parameters, attributing the joint network system for best performance in the context of the desired e-health services.	pervasive informatics;prospective search;quality of service;real-time clock;telecommunications link;whole earth 'lectronic link	Dimitris Komnakos;Demosthenes Vouyioukas;Ilias Maglogiannis;Philip Constantinou	2008		10.1145/1389586.1389615	embedded system;feasibility study;simulation;wireless sensor network;quality of service;telecommunications;biological data;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-11.952689013773327	94.92250937231346	108765

Application awareness can be utilized in access networks to optimize quality of experience (QoE) of end clients. In this study, we utilize information at the client-side application (e.g., video resolution) to achieve superior resource allocation that improves user QoE. We emphasize optimizing QoE of the system rather than quality of service (QoS), as user satisfaction directly relies on QoE and optimizing QoS does not necessarily optimize QoE, as shown in this study. We propose application-aware resource-allocation schemes on an Ethernet passive optical network (EPON), which supports wireless (utilizing orthogonal frequency division multiple access) and wired clients running video-conference applications. Numerical results show that the application-aware resource-allocation schemes improve QoE for video-conference applications for wired and wireless clients.	access network;client-side;display resolution;edge enhancement;ethernet in the first mile;frequency divider;passive optical network;quality of service;requirement	Divya Chitimalla;Biswanath Mukherjee;Massimo Tornatore;Sang-Soo Lee;Han Hyub Lee;Soomyung Park;Hwan Seok Chung	2018	IEEE/OSA Journal of Optical Communications and Networking		computer network;wireless network;quality of service;orthogonal frequency-division multiple access;computer science;ethernet;quality of experience;access network;passive optical network;resource allocation	Mobile	-8.544114774106056	99.10543999359801	108886

046d99cb1eba9913452c958f3b48020bf215a5d7	architecture for video streaming application on heterogeneous platform	heterogeneous platform;quantization parameter;streaming library	In this paper, we propose a new architecture, which is an efficient streaming media player application on heterogeneous platform. The streaming library can be used in design for reducing the memory bandwidth on processing RTSP/RTP/RTCP network protocols. And the proposed improvement has to do with the I-frame encoding alone. The architecture can receive higher rate for data transfer and packet loss in embedded system. The framework of the key components is able to adopt Direct Memory Access to reduce the time-consumption resulted from the communication between the dual cores. On the other hand, the approach of the dynamic quality adaption improves the video bitstream by periodically adjusting the values of encoding quality parameters. Through the experiment results, it is evident that the new video streaming architecture greatly enhances the coding efficacy. Our experimental results present that the decoding/encoding speed of the dual-core CPU embedded with Direct Memory Access is enhanced up to 50 %, and its usage of CPU resources and memory bandwidth are 50 % lower than that of the popular JRTPLIB.	algorithm;bitstream;central processing unit;communications protocol;data rate units;digital media player;direct memory access;embedded system;load (computing);memory bandwidth;mobile device;multi-core processor;network packet;streaming media;ti-nspire series;vlc media player;whole earth 'lectronic link	Yung-Sung Huang;Bin-Chang Chieu	2014	Multimedia Tools and Applications	10.1007/s11042-014-1856-y	embedded system;real-time computing;computer science;operating system;multimedia;computer network	HPC	-8.241728592033356	99.92898640091825	109133

In this paper, an adaptive media playout assisted rate adaptation scheme (AMP-RA) is proposed to improve the user experience of the video streaming over LTE systems. Firstly, an optimization problem is formulated, which aims at maximizing user experience and subject to the constraints of playout continuity and the amount of available resource. Moreover, a two-step method is proposed to solve the problem. In step 1, a preliminary requesting plan will be determined in order to guarantee the playout continuity. In step 2, the residual resource is utilized for the clients to improve their experience. Specifically, we give a method for the users to lower its playout frame rate and utilize the resource. Then, based on this method, the residual resource is allocated to the UEs. Finally, the simulation results verify the performance of AMP-RA in improving the user experience.	bass amplifier;business continuity;compaq lte;hypertext transfer protocol;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;playout;scott continuity;simulation;streaming media;traffic collision avoidance system;user experience	Yuchen Chen;Guizhong Liu	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia & Expo Workshops (ICMEW)	10.1109/ICMEW.2016.7574717	real-time computing;media;mobile telephony;network switch;computer science;adaptive system;operating system;multimedia;server;computer network	Robotics	-7.766006200315988	98.96176415260732	109211

In order to efficiently utilize the network resource, different spatial layers are transmitted on different radio channels. Users request streams of different resolution by subscribing to the necessary radio channels. On each radio channel, we optimize the error protection for the spatial layer transmitted on that channel, considering the importance of different NAL units and channel quality of subscribers on that channel. As a further development of our previous framework for multicast streaming application of SVC stream with quality scalability on single radio channel, the framework in this paper supports spatial scalability and guarantees optimized error protection for different spatial layers. Our simulations show that graceful degradation can be achieved for videos with different resolutions. The user distribution with different channel quality is considered in the framework and a good tradeoff in terms of the video quality is achieved on each channel among different users.	data compression;elegant degradation;fault tolerance;group of pictures;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;mathematical optimization;maximal set;network abstraction layer;network packet;peer-to-peer;real-time clock;scalability;scalable video coding;scalable video multicast;simulation;simulcast	Bin Zhang;Mathias Wien	2012	2012 19th International Packet Video Workshop (PV)	10.1109/PV.2012.6229728	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	-6.182263463670233	102.25148524097537	109237

In the view of these challenges, error control is an important mechanism that enables us to provide robust multimedia communication and maintain Quality of Service (QoS). Despite the existence of some good research works on error control analysis in WSNs, none of them provides a thorough study of error control schemes for multimedia delivery.

Ensuring realistic performance conditions, however, constitutes a significant engineering challenge due to the extremely strict requirements in terms of network delay and audio quality, which are needed to maintain a stable tempo, a satisfying synchronicity between performers and, more generally, a high-quality interaction experience. In this paper, we offer a review of the psycho-perceptual studies conducted in the past decade, aimed at identifying latency tolerance thresholds for synchronous real-time musical performance. We also provide an overview of hardware/software enabling technologies for NMP, with a particular emphasis on system architecture paradigms, networking configurations, and applications to real use cases.	internet;real-time clock;requirement;synchronicity;systems architecture;telecommunications network	Cristina Rottondi;Chris Chafe;Claudio Allocchio;Augusto Sarti	2016	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2628440	simulation;computer science;music;multimedia	Metrics	-12.139861756335039	96.63391063094348	109618

We implemented this service, with the form of android app. We provide the station contents of seok-chon and jamsil subway station in Seoul.

We are now witnessing the emergence of mobile networks, namely a set of hosts that move collectively as a unit, such as on ships and aircrafts. The protocols for mobility support therefore need to be extended from supporting an individual mobile device to supporting an entire mobile network. In this paper we examine the state-of-the-art in network mobility support. We first motivate the problem by considering typical network mobility scenarios and identify the characteristics that require new solutions. We then study the design requirements of the protocols that support network mobility. Thereafter, we review some of the current approaches for network mobility support, and discuss their strengths and weaknesses in addressing the design requirements. We conclude by identifying some open research issues in the realization of mobile networks.	emergence;mobile ip;mobile device;open research;proxy mobile ipv6;requirement	Eranga Perera;Vijay Sivaraman;Aruna Seneviratne	2004	Mobile Computing and Communications Review	10.1145/997122.997127	radio access network;embedded system;cellular network;intelligent network;mobile identification number;mobile search;mobile ad hoc network;mobile web;public land mobile network;computer science;operating system;mobile agent;mobile device;mobility model;mobile computing;mobile communications over ip;computer security;mobile ip;computer network	Mobile	-14.059932578298826	89.70714010241008	110158

In this paper, we present Elite addresses the playback lag problem in peer-assisted live streaming systems. Instead of deploying a large initial offset to all the users, Elite seeks the possibility of initializing users with layered proportional initial scheduling point, thus achieving differentiated playback lag service for the system. For saving server bandwidth and reducing lag time, Elite employs a novel strategy which arranges peers into a virtual tree structure and quantifies playback lag of each layer that finally converges to a constant value. This way, Elite can help users to achieve much shorter average playback lag and prioritized service within the same channel. As illustrated in our design, analysis, and simulation studies, Elite is able to fully exploit limited pool of server bandwidth to support peer-assisted live streaming with prioritized playback lag, and achieves shorter average playback lag compared with synchronized strategy, such as R2.	elite;scheduling (computing);server (computing);simulation;streaming media;tree structure;window of opportunity	Shiping Li;Jin Zhao;Xin Wang	2012	2012 IEEE 20th International Workshop on Quality of Service	10.1109/IWQoS.2012.6245971	real-time computing;computer science;multimedia;tree structure;world wide web	Arch	-7.356197596592643	97.87688160118532	110193

Dead reckoning refers to a class of algorithms typically employed to predict the state of objects in existing games to mitigate the effects of game lag and improve player experience. For a deployed realtime tank game, we found that increasing latencies will cause gradual degradation to the performance of an AI agent and the performance is severely degraded when latencies reach about 300 ms. We show that a simple implementation of dead reckoning is able to delay the onset of performance degradation for round-trip latencies up to 250 ms and is relatively robust to network jitter and packet loss. Since the observed average latency within the continental North America is approximately 55 ms and inter-continental latencies are in the vicinity of 250 ms, our results demonstrate that it is feasible to offload AI to client machines. Most importantly, our method is practical because it does not require much additional code and it allows offloaded AI agents to be developed in a network-oblivious manner similar to what is presently done for server-based AI.	algorithm;artificial intelligence;dead reckoning;elegant degradation;köppen climate classification;network packet;onset (audio);peer-to-peer;server (computing)	Jiaqiang Bai;Daryl Seah;James Yong;Ben Leong	2009			embedded system;real-time computing;simulation;operating system;distributed computing;computer security	AI	-8.73017255507873	97.4106519289193	110242

This paper presents a caching-list based fast handoff mechanism (CLH) which includes two parts: first, the client needs to keep a list of available access points; second, when the client needs to handoff, it will send an authentication request frame rather than probe request frame in active scanning. We evaluate the benefits of CLH in a real network which only needs to modify the wireless driver (madwifi) in the client side. Our result shows that CLH improves the availability and results in reducing the handoff latency.	authentication;cache (computing);client-side;interrupt latency;mesh networking;seamless3d;wireless access point;wireless mesh network	Huaixian Yin;Haibo Ni;Liang Sun;Mingxuan Wang;Xun Zhou	2013	2013 International Conference on ICT Convergence (ICTC)	10.1109/ICTC.2013.6675382	wireless mesh network;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	-10.606911093520708	89.87026652805264	110312

Traditionally, the settlement between the ISPs are determined based on bilateral agreements that result from pair-wise negotiations. Although this settlement mechanism is intuitive and easy to implement, it does not encourage network- wide cooperation, as the bilateral charges typically do not lead to a fair division of revenue among all ISPs that are involved in carrying the same flows of traffic. This problem is getting more severe with various emerging new Internet business models. In this paper, we try to determine the existence and realizability of bilateral prices that can achieve fair revenue division among ISPs. In particular, we use Shapley value as the basis for deriving fair prices. Under a quite general topology and traffic model, we find that there exists prices that make the revenue division under bilateral settlement equal to that calculated under Shapley value. The corresponding """"fair price"""" exhibits several nice and desirable characteristics. Moreover, it could be realized approximately."""	bilateral filter;dot-com company;end-user license agreement;internet;peering	Yang Cheung;Dah-Ming Chiu;Jianwei Huang	2008	2008 Proceedings of 17th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks	10.1109/ICCCN.2008.ECP.47	service provider;fair division;pricing;business model;routing;the internet;systems modeling;computer science;network effect;traffic flow;shapley value;computer security;network topology;computer network	Networks	-16.23313626868679	98.66358616269966	110317

So each one of them besides its own data gets also the data destined for the others. Under these conditions privacy and confidentiality do not exist. The usual way to overcome this drawback is conventional encryption of the data between headend and terminals. This method besides making the communication procedure more complex, has also the drawback that traffic data cannot be protected, since the destination field of each cell cannot be encrypted . Here another method is presented which, although not encryption in the conventional meaning of the term , secures a high degree of individuality and confidentiality. The basic idea is to use different multiplexing patterns for each connection so that each terminal can demultiplex only its own data. The method is suited for the high data speed ofthe PON networks and maybe preferable to conventional encryption.	confidentiality;encryption;hybrid fibre-coaxial;multiplexing;passive optical network	J.

Contributing to this effort, in this paper we provide a comprehensive overview and inventory of the currently available QoE estimation approaches and models. More specifically, we discuss the relation between QoS and QoE, the major QoE influence factors, the QoE evaluation end estimation process, and the dominant objective QoE estimation models.	knowledge management;microsoft forefront;motion estimation;programming paradigm;provisioning;quality of service;real-time clock;telecommunications network	Eirini Liotou;Dimitris Tsolkas;Nikos I.

Several micro-mobility protocols have been defined as improvements – Hierarchical Mobile IP, Fast Handover and Cellular IP, etc. While these micro-mobility protocols help in reducing handover delay, they bring along the requirement of some sort of predefined security association between various entities. Implementing these may be difficult, and Mobile IPv6 actually tried to eliminate such requirements. In this paper, we propose certain modifications to Mobile IPv6 by introducing the mobile agents to take care of the mobility management. Moreover, the scheme does not assume any security association between entities belonging to different networks. We also present simulation results to prove the performance improvement.	mobile ip	Basav Roychoudhury;Dilip Kr.

Each subflow runs independently allowing the connection to be maintained if endpoints change; essential in a dynamic network. Differentiating between congestion delay and delay due to handoffs is an important distinction overlooked by transport layer protocols. Protocol modifications are needed to alleviate handoff induced issues in a growing mobile culture. In this paper, findings are presented on transport layer handoff issues in currently deployed networks. MPTCP as a potential solution to addressing handoff- and mobility-related service continuity issues is discussed. Finally, a handoff-aware cross-layer-assisted MPTCP (CLA-MPTCP) congestion control algorithm is designed and evaluated.	algorithm;experiment;internet protocol suite;network congestion;proactive parallel suite;scott continuity;seamless3d;wireless access point	Hassan Sinky;Bechir Hamdaoui;Mohsen Guizani	2016	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2016.2545656	communications protocol;throughput;real-time computing;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;wireless;computer network	Mobile	-12.000374781286608	90.47444935249422	110867

This paper presents the “Cognitive Packet Network (CPN)” architecture in which intelligent peer-to-peer routing is carried out with the help of “smart packets” based on best-effort QoS goals. Since packetized voice has stringent QoS requirements, we then discuss the choice of a “goal” and “reward” function for this application and present experiments we have conducted for “voice over CPN”. Its performance is detailed via several measurements, and the resulting QoS is compared with that of the IP routing protocol under identical conditions showing the gain resulting from the use of CPN.	best-effort delivery;coloured petri net;experiment;future internet;packet switching;peer-to-peer;performance;quality of service;requirement;routing;scalability	Erol Gelenbe;Ricardo Lent;Alfonso Montuori;Zhiguang Xu	2002		10.1109/MASCOT.2002.1167055	real-time computing;quality of service;computer science;voice over ip;distributed computing;reinforcement learning;computer network	Networks	-5.66681157815619	94.96602143068698	110907

The original idea of a fully integrated network, which was originally introduced with ISDN and further propelled by the B-ISDN concept, seems unlikely to be realised at a complete extent. However, unification needs between different networks are present, an example being voice/data integration. Bringing together the characteristics of different networks creates a huge potential for new services, which can take advantage of strong points of individual networks in order to optimise specific service parameters. However, although network integration at transport technologies may be an idealistic assumption, the management of services traversing different networks cannot be done without considering the accurate definition of a unified service framework, taking care of harmonising, from a service designer’s viewpoint, differences existing at network transport layers. In other words, if transport integration cannot be achieved, integration at service design and service management level must be pursued in order to cope with emerging and future services. Mobile Agent Technology (MAT) based on Distributed Object Technology (DOT) represents a key issue in defining methodologies and framework for a unified service environment encompassing different networks. These technologies, being largely independent from the underlying network, provide the means to build and manage services in a heterogeneous environment. Furthermore, they allow an easy deployment of new components on network systems, which is a key requirement in facing the problem of providing services in a fast and efficient way in a rapidly changing environment. This paper discusses a DOT/MAT based approach to the problem of creating and managing services in a heterogeneous network environment. q 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.		Fotis G.

A new way to improve the performance of ad hoc networks consists in using cross layer mechanisms. Currently, several protocols  have demonstrated some reachable performance gain. Global integration on each level of the protocol stack has to be ensured.  We present some efficient methods that may either produce or update cross-layer models. Those models, developed on different  levels, allow an efficient organisation of the wireless systems and could take several forms. A cross-layer conceptual model  is composed of: cross-layer interaction models and interactions description arrays. In this paper, we propose a method which  has been applied to a chosen protocol stack.  		M.

However, there is no common understanding of what is required to capture such realism. Conventional wisdom suggests that competing background traffic will influence service and protocol behavior. Once again however, there is no understanding of what aspects of background traffic are important and the extent to which services are sensitive to these characteristics. Earlier work shows that Internet traffic demonstrates significant burstiness at a range of time scales. Unfortunately, existing systems evaluations either do not consider background traffic or employ simple synthetic models, e.g., based on Poisson arrivals, that do not capture these burstiness properties. In this paper, we show that realistic background traffic, has qualitatively different impact on application and protocol behavior than simple traffic models. One conclusion from our work is that applications should be evaluated under a range of background traffic characteristics to determine the relative merits of applications and to understand behavior in corner cases of live deployment.	bandwidth management;control theory;corner case;distributed computing;emulator;experiment;hypertext transfer protocol;internet;marvin (robot);simulation;software deployment;synthetic intelligence	Kashi Venkatesh Vishwanath;Amin Vahdat	2008			traffic generation model;communications protocol;simulation;internet traffic;telecommunications;computer science;traffic shaping;computer security	Metrics	-5.327739585810089	96.76062144852932	111159

In our early experiments, evolving graphs represent time varying models of mobile wireless communication networks but they could also represent more abstract architectural representations such as middleware topologies or social network dynamics. While in its technical infancy, mobile network community analysis is an important capability in network planning, management, and adaptation strategies. We first present some discussion and technical background required to describe the analytical components and dynamic network modeling techniques. A set of mobile network scenarios are then described and applied to demonstrate the use of the dynamic spectral partitioning methods. We also develop and present a potential aid to dynamically establish partition set size and introduce a heuristic metric for partitioning quality. Our dynamic network experiments are represented by a series of evolving weighted graphs with dynamic attribute data that we plan to use in future work to represent network neighbor quality effects or other metrics as deemed appropriate to the scenario.

However, the provision of QoS in a mobile ad hoc network is a challenging task. In this paper, we present a review of the current research related to the provision of QoS in an ad hoc environment. We examine issues and challenges involved in providing QoS in an ad hoc network. We discuss methods of QoS provisioning at different levels including those at the levels of routing, Medium Access Control (MAC), and cross layer. Also, we discuss schemes for admission control and scheduling that are proposed in the literature for the provision of QoS. We compare salient features of various solutions and approaches and point out directions for future work.	access control;hoc (programming language);provisioning;quality of service;routing;scheduling (computing)	Ash Mohammad Abbas;Øivind Kure	2010	IJAHUC	10.1504/IJAHUC.2010.034322	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile qos;mobile ad hoc network;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;ad hoc wireless distribution service;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-14.099003398054398	96.0066082105539	111269

As a matter of fact, security issues, traditionally covered in stations by means of video-surveillance are clearly lacking on-board trains, due to the absence of efficient transmission means from the train to a supervising control centre. Similarly, diagnostic or maintenance issues are generally handled when the train arrives in stations or during maintenance stops, which prevents proactive actions to be carried out. The aim of the project is to circumvent these limitations and offer a system level solution.

However, combinations and comparisons of Temporal and Quality Scaling have not been systematically studied. This research extends previous work to provide a model for combining Temporal and Quality Scaling, and uses an optimization algorithm to provide a systematic analysis of their combination over a range of network conditions and video content. Analytic experiments show: 1) Quality Scaling typically performs better than Temporal Scaling, with performance differences correlated with the motion characteristics of the video. In fact, when the network capacity is moderate and the loss rate is low, Quality Scaling performs nearly as well as the optimal combination of Quality and Temporal Scaling; 2) when the network capacity is low and the packet loss rate is high, Quality Scaling alone is ineffective, but a combination of Quality and Temporal Scaling can provide reasonable video quality; 3) adjusting the amount of Forward Error Correction (FEC) provides significantly better performance than video streaming without FEC or video streaming with a fixed amount of FEC.	2.5d;algorithm;analytic signal;digital video;experiment;forward error correction;image scaling;mathematical optimization;network packet;qr code;scalability;streaming media	Huahui Wu;Mark Claypool;Robert E.

SLAs define the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the services provided from a network provider to peering networks or customers. In this work, we define a template for the SLA structure to support the provision of a QoS service between two peering domains and then we proceed with the definition of an end-to-end SLA across consecutive domains, based on the bilateral ones.

The question is – how do users perceive such services on mobile terminals? The objective of this study is to find the correlation between video quality thresholds and the user context. Our study reveals the thresholds of user’s quality of experience (QoE) in a mobile environment by using different categories of content types, in relation to different access technologies and terminal capability. The mobile terminals used are: – (i) 3G Mobile Phone (ii) Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) and (iii) Laptop. We argue that quality of service (QoS) management should be driven by the user perception of quality rather than resulting from raw engineering parameters such as latency, jitter, bandwidth etc. Our results will be of great interest to network operators, service providers, terminal manufacturers, and researchers working in the area of quality of service management.	digital distribution;laptop;mobile phone;personal digital assistant;quality of service;raw engineering;streaming media	Florence Agboma;Antonio Liotta	2007	Mobile Information Systems		mobile search;mobile qos;mobile web;quality of service;gsm services;computer science;mobile technology;multimedia;mobile computing;world wide web;computer network	Mobile	-10.938985717567068	99.7844829467389	112616

Our allocation technique takes into account distortions caused by source coding, channel impairments and error concealment in order to assign users different priority levels. These priorities are then used to serve users in such a way that the highest levels correspond to the worst performing users. Variable bitrates are achieved by unequal error protection of the different video streams using rate-compatible punctured turbo-codes. Simulation results show a significant improvement in the overall system performance compared to a traditional system where all users are allocated equal channel resources.	algorithm;data compression;distortion;elegant degradation;encoder;error concealment;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;mathematical optimization;memory management;multi-user;peak signal-to-noise ratio;server (computing);simulation;streaming media;turbo code	Charles Yaacoub;Joumana Farah;Nancy E.

During the experiment, the clients streamed low-bitrate MPEG-4 video sequences from the server over paths with more than 5,000 distinct Internet routers. We describe the methodology of the experiment, the architecture of our NACK-based streaming application, study end-to-end dynamics of 16 thousand ten-minute sessions (85 million packets), and analyze the behavior of the following network parameters: packet loss, round-trip delay, one-way delay jitter, packet reordering, and path asymmetry.

In such cases, traffic is usually modeled as a collection of flows, which are identified based on certain features such as IP address pairs. One central problem is to identify those """"heavy hitter"""" flows, which account for a large percentage of total traffic, e.g., at least 0.1% of the link capacity. However, the challenge for this goal is that keeping an individual counter for each flow is too slow, costly, and non-scalable. In this paper, we describe a novel data structure called the Probabilistic Bloom Filter (PBF), which extends the classical bloom filter into the probabilistic direction, so that it can effectively identify heavy hitters. We analyze the performance, tradeoffs, and capacity of this data structure. Our study also investigates how to calibrate this data structure's parameters. We also develop two extensions of the basic form of the PBF for more flexible application needs. We use real network traces collected on a Web query server and a backbone router to test the performance of the PBF, and demonstrate that this method can accurately keep track of all objects' frequencies, including websites and flows, so that heavy hitters can be identified with constant time computational complexity and low memory overhead."""	application programming interface;bandwidth management;bloom filter;computational complexity theory;core router;dos;data structure;denial-of-service attack;internet backbone;mac address;overhead (computing);requirement;router (computing);scalability;sensor;server (computing);time complexity;tracing (software);vii	Yanjun Yao;Sisi Xiong;Jilong Liao;Michael W.

Mobile video traffic accounts for more than 50% of the total traffic on mobile networks and will grow 66-fold over a period of five years. In addition, watching videos over mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets has been attracting interest from users, and demand for mobile video streaming is increasing. However, existing wireless technologies (e.g., WiFi, WiMax, or LTE) cannot support this impending demand. And today’s mobile video streaming performance on wireless networks is choppy due to unpredictable wireless errors and mobility. To support seamless mobile video streaming, several approaches, such as new video codecs, multiple interfaces, metric techniques, novel multiplexing and network coding schemes, were developed. However, these approaches need client modification and did not consider multiple streams sharing the same medium, realistic scenarios and mobility. This paper proposes a practical online scheduling algorithm for mobile video streaming to multiple users with network coding capabilities. Implementation and analysis results show that this scheme closely approximates the optimal solution for both mobile video quality and throughput.	smartphone;streaming media	Hayoung Oh	2013	Smart CR	10.6029/smartcr.2013.01.004	real-time computing;mobile search;mobile web;imt advanced;computer science;mobile technology;video tracking;multimedia;mobile collaboration;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	-8.395910146066088	99.81234372635475	112820

Our content-level measurements -- understanding the ad distribution mechanisms and evaluating location-based and behavioral targeting approaches -- bring useful auditing information to all entities involved in the on line advertising business.

MPEG uses intra-frame and inter-frame compression with three types of frames: I, P and B frames. The repeated pattern of I, P and B frames in an MPEG stream is known as the Group of Pictures (GOP). The choice of GOP affects static MPEG properties such as frame size and file size and also impacts the streaming MPEG in terms of network bitrate and playable quality. Current GOP choices are made using intuition and informal guidelines without the support of theoretical or practical evidence. This paper studies the impact of the choice of GOP by evaluating the effects of GOP on both static MPEG videos and on MPEG videos streaming over a lossy network. The static analysis involves encoding raw video images into MPEG files with various GOP patterns to compare and contrast static properties such as the frame size, file size and quality. The streaming analysis varies the GOP length and pattern to study the impact of GOP on a model of the streaming bitrate and playable frame rate. The MPEG streaming analysis considers 3 distinct cases over a network model with packet loss: normal streaming with no repair and no capacity limit; streaming with Forward Error Correction (FEC) but no capacity limit; and streaming with FEC and a capacity limit. The results consistently suggest two guidelines: 1) the number of B frames between two reference frames should be close to 2, except when limited to less than 2 by the encoding and time constraints; 2) the number of P frames should be 5 or fewer as there is little performance gain in setting the number of P frames in the GOP larger than 5.	forward error correction;frame language;group of pictures;internet;intra-frame coding;jumbo frame;lossy compression;moving picture experts group;network model;network packet;qr code;static program analysis;uncompressed video;video compression picture types	Huahui Wu;Mark Claypool;Robert E.

There are several major differences between the embedded domain and traditional subscriber-centric mobile communications. Chief among these is the way in which embedded services are provisioned (the process of connecting EM devices to wide-area wireless networks) and the life-cycle management of embedded mobiles. This paper summarizes the results of a project by Nokia Siemens Networks and the GSMA (GSM Association: association of mobile operators) designed to identify how mobile operators need to transform the provisioning process to serve the emerging embedded mobile market. The project used the Nokia Siemens Networks Service Provider Enterprise Architecture Vision (SEAV) methodology to map out the existing provisioning landscape and transformational requirements. SEAV, which is based on the generic Enterprise Architecture methodology, was developed by Nokia Siemens Networks as part of a research project.	embedded system;enterprise architecture;machine to machine;provisioning;requirement	Harald Bender;Mikko Kolehmainen;Gerald Lehmann;Janne Parantainen;Markus Staufer;Marcos Tong	2011	2011 15th International Conference on Intelligence in Next Generation Networks	10.1109/ICIN.2011.6081068	embedded system;engineering;operations management;computer network	Mobile	-17.660087003455946	93.25119584040448	113275

However, finding all heavy-hitters might require large memory for storage of flows information that is incompatible with the usage of fast and small memory. Moreover, upcoming 100Gbps transmission rates make this recognition more challenging. How to improve the accuracy of heavy-hitters identification with limited memory space has become a critical issue. This paper presents a scalable algorithm named Mnemonic Lossy Counting (MLC) that improves the accuracy of heavy-hitters identification while having a reasonable time and space complexity. MLC algorithm holds potential candidate heavy-hitters in a historical information table. This table is used to obtain tighter error bounds on the estimated sizes of candidate heavy-hitters. We validate the MLC algorithm using real network traffic traces, and we compared its performance with two state-of-the-art algorithms, namely Lossy Counting (LC) and Probabilistic Lossy Counting (PLC). The results reveal that: 1) with same set of parameters and memory usage, MLC achieves between 31.5% and 6.67% fewer false positives than LC and PLC. 2) MLC and LC have a zero false negative ratio, whereas 38% of the cases PLC has a non-zero false negatives and PLC can miss up to 4.4% of heavy-hitters. 3) MLC has a slightly lower memory cost than LC during the first few windows and its memory usage decreases with time, when PLC memory usage declines sharply. 4) MLC has similar runtime than LC, and smaller time than PLC.	applicative programming language;attribute-value system;central processing unit;computational complexity theory;computer memory;dspace;data rate units;internet security;lossy count algorithm;lossy compression;microsoft windows;multi-level cell;network packet;norm (social);optical carrier transmission rates;requirement;scalability;time complexity;tracing (software)	Qiong Rong;Guangxing Zhang;Gaogang Xie;Kavé Salamatian	2010	International Performance Computing and Communications Conference	10.1109/PCCC.2010.5682303	time complexity;algorithm design;real-time computing;the internet;type i and type ii errors;mnemonic;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system;traffic flow;probability;internet security;accuracy and precision;dspace;particle detector;computational complexity theory;computer security;computer network;memory management	HPC	-5.828800143386742	90.04019369741334	114085
d32b422b89c489b23785f2762a4f8bac75342fda	a hierarchical classification model of qoe influence factors		Quality of Service (QoS) optimization are not sufficient to ensure users needs. That’s why, operators are investigating a new concept called Quality of Experience (QoE), to evaluate the real quality perceived by users. This concept becomes more and more important, but still hard to estimate. This estimation can be influenced by a lot of factors called: Quality of Experience Influence Factors (QoE IFs). In this work, we survey and review existing approaches to classify QoE IFs. Then, we present a new modular and extensible classification architecture. Finally, regarding the proposed classification, we evaluate some QoE estimation approaches to highlight the fact that categories do not affect in the same the user perception.

The adaptation includes both selecting and dynamically switching the underlying connection used, as well as coping with disconnection situation. This paper describes the architecture and design of HTTP input channel for multi-access wireless network. A series of experiments were performed in a GPRS-WLAN integrated environment. Performance metrics were measured and analyzed. In particular, the time delay of channel creation and connection switching was investigated. For channel creation, the majority of time delay comes from the normal operation of HTTP URL connection. More time is needed for best connection evaluation and default gateway changing when more than one connection is available. For passive switching delay both event detection and connection evaluation contribute to the most besides the normal HTTP connection opening	broadcast delay;cma-es;client–server model;comparison of command shells;experiment;flip-flop (electronics);hypertext transfer protocol;network packet;open platform;server (computing);software performance testing	Jun-Zhao Sun;Jukka Riekki;Marko Jurmu;Jaakko J.

To deliver optimum user Quality of Experience (QoE), existing RDA applications are “network-aware” i.e., they employ online encoding adaptation that is based on network Quality of Service (QoS) measurement between the client and server ends. In this paper, we propose and evaluate an online RDA encoding adaptation scheme that is “human-and-network aware” i.e., our novel adaptation considers Quality of Application (QoA) performance perceived by the user in addition to the network QoS measured by the application. Owing to our offline QoA performance modeling strategy that uses polynomial regression and bootstrap sampling, our scheme does not require input from actual users for the online encoding adaptation. Our performance validation results show that our proposed human-network-aware adaptation outperforms the network-aware adaptation in terms of user QoE for a wide-variety of degraded network QoS conditions.	bootstrapping (statistics);desktop computer;experiment;online and offline;performance prediction;polynomial;quality of service;remote database access;remote desktop software;sampling (signal processing);server (computing);television	Prasad Calyam;Abdul Kalash;Ashok Krishnamurthy;Gordon Renkes	2009	2009 IEEE International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing	10.1109/MMSP.2009.5293295	distance education;data modeling;bootstrapping;sampling;training set;rna;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;machine learning;polynomial regression;data mining;multimedia;world wide web;bandwidth;regression analysis;encoding;statistics	Mobile	-11.024283532798847	101.72299484237146	114680

Orders by telephone or e-mail are also welcome. We will confirm our acknowledgement of your order(s) shortly by phone or e-mail. In 2005, the number of FTTH service subscribers increased much more sharply than ever before due partly to aggressive sales promotion offerred by NTT that is targeting to achieve three hundred thousand cumulative subscribers by the year of 2010. The total number of FTTH service subscribers in Japan has reached five millions and forty five thousands as of the end of March, 2006 and the net increase of FTTH subscribers per month has surpassed that of ADSL, the most popular form of broadband internet accesess service in Japan at the time of March, 2006. Major factors that have made FTTH service more popular in these days include popularization of optical fiber IP phone as well as many different types of sales campaigns provided by communication carriers and IPS (Internet Service Providers) and lowered monthly fees. The lowered basic fees of the optical fiber IP phone is attractive enough for customers to switch from the conventional analog telephone due to the """"0ABJ"""" number porability service. It is truely remarkable that more than 60-70% of new subscribers to the FTTH internet access service concurrently subscribe to the IP phone services. In conjunction with the expansion of the FTTH service market, demand of transmission devices for access network has started to show upward trend and the optical communication related market as a whole has apparently becoming more active after the downturn that the market had experienced until a few years ago. Transmission capacity has increased due to enrichment and more frequent use of video contents and 10Gbps interface is coming to be a standard on the fiber optic backbone. In addition, demand of CWDM and WDM systems has gradually increased for the purpose of enhancing transmission capacity while achieving efficiency in use of fiber optic cables. In this market report, you can overview trends of FTTH service market in Japan. Also, status and trends of the FTTH related services provided by major communication carriers, as well as FTTH systems and devices they use, are introduced. Finally, profiles, major products and business strategeis of major device suppliers as well as their views on current and future market are provided.

The success of M2M communication relies on the scalability of underlying network architectures and protocols. In this paper, an adaptive multi-channel medium access control (MAC) protocol is proposed to address the scalability issue in M2M communications. The proposed MAC protocol enables devices to (1) real-time estimate the number of competing devices and (2) adjust their operation parameters to maximize channel utilization. Our numerical results show that the proposed protocol outperforms the existing multi-channel protocols, especially when the number of competing devices is large and fluctuates with time.	access control;communications protocol;emergence;machine to machine;numerical analysis;real-time clock;scalability;semantic network;throughput	Chen-Yu Hsu;Chi-Hsien Yen;Chun-Ting Chou	2013	2013 9th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2013.6583731	internet protocol;reverse address resolution protocol;otway–rees protocol;general inter-orb protocol;real time streaming protocol;universal composability;diameter protocol;real-time computing;media access control;user datagram protocol;internet layer;resource reservation protocol;internet protocol control protocol;computer science;link control protocol;tunneling protocol;distributed computing;link access procedures, d channel;link-local address;internet protocol suite;port control protocol;computer network;internetwork protocol	Mobile	-8.341617121129522	89.4981726630124	115242

With the advent of broadband accesses, more users are willing to download large volume content from servers, such as video files of TV shows. While some popular video services (e.g. YouTube.com) or some broadcasting companies (e.g. ABC.com) use streaming data with Flash technology, some media distributors (e.g. iTunes) offer entire TV shows for download. In this study, we investigate the performance of the German site OnlineTVRecorder.com (OTR), which acts as an online video cassette recorder (VCR) where users can program their favorite shows over a web interface and download the recorded files from a server or its mirrors. These files are offered in different file formats and can consist of several hundred megabytes up to 1 GB or more depending on the length of the TV show as well as the encoding format. OTR can, thus, be seen as an example for a server-based content distribution system with large data files.	compact cassette;digital distribution;download;internet;megabyte;server (computing);streaming media;user interface;video clip;video file format;videocassette recorder;libotr	Tobias Hoßfeld;Kenji Leibnitz;Marie-Ange Remiche	2007	SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review	10.1145/1330555.1330563	stability;performance;computer science;operating system;videocassette recorder;internet privacy;user interface;world wide web;statistics;computer network	Metrics	-10.469096741617909	96.81720152284616	116165

Our strategy to do this consists of three main tasks: composing a list of many Internet hosts to represent the whole Internet, conducting measurements with all hosts in the list and finally evaluating the gained data with respect to the performance of end user applications. The results can be used by Internet customers to evaluate the performance of service providers or by service providers themselves to monitor their connectivity.  1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

The objective is to perform offline maximization of revenue from served demands in the context of self-similar (long range dependent) traffic. We use an alpha-stable distribution for the aggregate demand volume to capture the appropriate level of traffic burstiness. We take a centralized view of the network topology, link capacity and demand. We use a new mean-risk modeling approach to that considers both the mean and the risk of bandwidth allocation. We also propose a risk measure appropriate for infinite variance alpha-stable distribution.	aggregate data;centralized computing;entropy maximization;financial risk modeling;network topology;online and offline;risk measure;self-similarity	Armin Ghayoori;Alberto Leon-Garcia	2009	GLOBECOM 2009 - 2009 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5426077	probability distribution;random variable;traffic engineering;simulation;index term;computer science;stable distribution;stochastic dominance;aggregate demand;computational model;network topology;bandwidth;statistics;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network;bandwidth allocation	Metrics	-7.310604598694422	95.18827919893977	116314

Users are hungry for new converged Internet Protocol (IP) multimedia services driven by new user devices and the wider availability of broadband access networks.

New and traditional service providers are anxious to create offers with exciting new capabilities that use the innovative Internet paradigm to create converged voice, data, and video services.

In addition, mobile Stream Control Transmission Protocol (mSCTP) proposed by the IETF is a new transport protocol supporting mobility and with a built-in feature called Multi-homing has attracted much attention from the research communities. Multi-homing is convenient to introduce IP diversity in mobility management. A seamless handover architecture called SIGMA based on mSCTP has better performance than Mobile IPv6 enhancements. However, the handover performance in SIGMA remains low if the mobile host moves at a fast speed. Aiming at this problem, we propose SHSBM, a Smooth Handover Scheme based-on mSCTP. SHSBM adopts the advantage of SIGMA, and utilize Buffer and Tunnel to better serve fast-moving users. Additionally, we propose two strategies to solve the problem caused by Buffer-scheme--sequence Out of Order.

Quji Guo is with Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Illinois, USA. ABSTRACT A new architecture of sender-adaptive and receiver-driven layered multicasting for video over Internet is presented in this paper. This architecture optimizes the overall performance by making the sender collaborate with the receivers. The statistical characteristics of bandwidth and packet loss ratio of all the receivers, the network temporal variation of each receiver, and the rate-distortion relation of the video codec have been taken into account. Techniques of network resource allocation, scalable video coding, FEC and pseudo-ARQ are also integrated in this scheme. Moreover, we introduce a new mathematical framework named as Q-Space Model & Optimization to generalize the multicasting approach. Simulation results demonstrate effectiveness of our scheme.	bandwidth (signal processing);codec;computer engineering;data compression;distortion;experimental system;forward error correction;internet;mathematical model;microsoft research;multicast;network packet;router (computing);scalability;scalable video coding;simulation	Quji Guo;Qian Zhang;Wenwu Zhu;Ya-Qin Zhang	2001		10.1109/ISCAS.2001.922005	scalable video coding;real-time computing;the internet;rate–distortion theory;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;forward error correction;statistics;computer network	Networks	-7.702531590052108	101.93937953050276	116511

5339eaf9d0dadc5385f40f0a33252447fd5dd336	multiview real-time media distribution for next generation networks	3d;application-level multicast;content delivery networks (cdn);dvb-t2;ip multicast;multiview;peer-to-peer (p2p);p2p-cdn;quality of service (qos);qos overprovisioning;video streaming	With the massive deployment of broadband access to the end-users, the continuous improvement of the hardware capabilities of end devices and better video compression techniques, acceptable conditions have been met to unleash over-the-top bandwidth demanding and time-stringent P2P applications, such as multiview real-time media distribution. Such applications enable the transmission of multiple views of the same scene, providing consumers with a more immersive visual experience. This article proposes an architecture to distribute multiview real-time media content using a hybrid DVB-T2, client-server and P2P paradigms, supported by an also novel QoS solution. The approach minimizes packet delay, interarrival jitter, inter-ISP traffic and traffic at the ISP core network, which are some of the main drawbacks of P2P networks, whilst still meeting stringent QoS demands. The proposed architecture uses DVB-T2 to distribute a self-contained and fully decodable base-layer video signal, assumed to be always available to the end-user, and an IP network to distribute in parallel with increased delay additional IP video streams. The result is a decoded video quality that adapts to individual end-user conditions and maximizes viewing experience. To achieve its target goal this architecture: defines new services for the ISP‘s services network and new roles for the ISP core, edge and border routers; makes use of pure IP multicast transmission at the ISP‘s core network, greatly minimizing bandwidth consumption; constructs a geographically contained P2P network that uses P2P application-level multicast trees to assist the distribution of the IP video streams at the ISP access networks, greatly reducing inter-ISP traffic, and; describes a novel QoS control architecture that takes advantage of the Internet resource over-provisioning techniques to meet stringent QoS demands in a scalable manner. The proposed architecture has been implemented in both real test bed implementation and ns-2 simulations. Results have shown a highly scalable P2P overlay construction algorithm, with very fast computation of application-level multicast trees (in the order of milliseconds), and efficient reaction to peer-churn with no perceptually annoying impairments noticed. Furthermore, enormous bandwidth savings are achieved at the ISP core network, which considerable lower management and investment costs in infrastructure. The QoS based results have also shown that the proposed approach effectively deploys a fast and scalable resource and admission control mechanism, considerably lowering signalling events using a per-class over-provisioning approach thus preventing per-flow QoS reservation signalling messages. Moreover, it is aware of network link resources in real-time and supports for service differentiation and network convergence by guaranteeing that each admitted traffic flow receives the contracted QoS. Finally, the proposed architecture for Multiview Real-Time Media Distribution for Next Generation Networks, as a component for a large project demonstrator, has been evaluated by an independent panel of experts following ITU recommendations, obtaining an excellent evaluation as computed by Mean Opinion Score.	access network;algorithm;client–server model;computation;data compression;digital video broadcasting;ip camera;internet access;multicast;network convergence;network packet;next-generation network;over-the-top content;peer-to-peer;provisioning;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time transcription;real-time web;scalability;server (computing);simulation;software deployment;streaming media;testbed;while	Hugo Marques;Hélio Silva;Evariste Logota;Jonathan Rodriguez;Seiamak Vahid;Rahim Tafazolli	2017	Computer Networks	10.1016/j.comnet.2017.03.002	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;computer security;computer network	Networks	-7.865721768511168	97.94504135956198	116791
72b4699a69011ea5617dfa4cc244150ca7585aaa	development tools and techniques for mobile telecommunications	development tool;mobile telecommunication	A vast majority of the current research on telecommunication networks relies on computational tools and computerbased experiments, among which the simulation techniques and tools take a prominent place. This special issue aims at presenting a selected number of papers that illustrate and emphasize this importance of such software tools and techniques. This is also an invitation for the readers to shift focus from the research results to the research process itself. Indeed, telecom research extensively relies on experimental techniques and tools. Therefore, and despite its strong theoretical foundations, this research should also be considered as a highly experimental exercise. As such, and similar to other “older” experimental sciences, we believe that particular attention should be paid also to the experimental process, and to the techniques and tools used to produce research results. Therefore, we are pleased to present this special issue featuring three papers describing new methodologies and tools relevant to the development of Mobile Network technologies. These papers are extensions of the best papers presented at the SIMUTools conference held in Marseille in 2008. SIMUTools is an international conference that brings together researchers and practitioners to address the latest developments in simulation research, methodology, models and practice. The first paper, “Automated Development of Cooperative MAC Protocols: A Complier-Assisted Approach”, Hermann S. Lichte et al., describes new software tools for code generation, and complier-based implementation of cooperative MAC protocols. The authors present a protocol specification language and, through compiler techniques, provide the means for automated validation and performance analysis. Additionally, the compiler is used to translate the specified protocols into program code for simulation and also into code for prototype development. The tools described in the paper present a largely automated development process for generating a practical implementation of cooperative MAC protocols. In the second paper, “Simulation of Ad Hoc Routing Protocols using OMNeT++, A Case Study for the DYMO Protocol”, Christoph Sommer et al. discuss the application of OMNet++ for simulation and performance evaluation of mobile ad hoc network(MANET) routing protocols. More specifically, the authors present guidelines for simulating ad hoc routing protocols using OMNeT++, describing set up procedures, control techniques, appropriate metrics, and evaluation procedures. Application of the guidelines are demonstrated with a simulation model, using OMNet++, and performance evaluation of a specific ad hoc routing network protocol, DYMO. Model calibration and validation “best practice” methods are also demonstrated through their application in this case study. In the third, and final, paper, “An Efficient Mechanism of UMTS Multicast Routing”, Antonios Alexiou et al. present a new multicast packet transmission scheme for Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) networks.

It is motivated by the perceived need for an easily accessible textbook that puts emphasis on the core concepts behind current and next generation networks. After an overview of how todayu0027s Internet works and a discussion of the main principles behind its architecture, we discuss the key ideas behind Ethernet, WiFi networks, routing, internetworking, and TCP. To make the book as self-contained as possible, brief discussions of probability and Markov chain concepts are included in the appendices. This is followed by a brief discussion of mathematical models that provide insight into the operations of network protocols. Next, the main ideas behind the new generation of wireless networks based on LTE, and the notion of QoS are presented. A concise discussion of the physical layer technologies underlying various networks is also included. F...		Jean C.

FT is useful for traffic management in unexpected events, e.g., when admitted flows lead to overload on a link after rerouting which may be due to a link or node failure. While AC is a classic flow control function, FT is new and only little understood so far. The limited literature on FT focuses mainly on a single overloaded link. However, when a link or node fails, redirected traffic is likely to cause overload on multiple backup links (bottlenecks) at the same time. As the packet marking probability for flows traversing multiple bottlenecks is larger than for flows traversing only the most severe bottleneck, more traffic is possibly terminated than needed, i.e. overtermination occurs. This paper quantifies potential overtermination in case of multiple bottlenecks for different FT mechanisms which are currently discussed by the IETF.	backup;bottleneck (software);experiment;flow control (data);ip traceback;item unique identification;mathematical model;media foundation;network congestion;network packet;program composition notation;risk management;simulation	Frank Lehrieder;Michael Menth	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2009.5199304	active traffic management;strontium;telecommunications;computer science;flow control;mathematical model;computer security;computer network	Embedded	-4.634292907171691	95.21815724944518	117091

In this work, we analyze the picture distortion caused by channel errors and the distortion propagation behavior in its subsequent frames along the motion prediction path. We propose a linear fitting approach algorithm to achieve a low complexity GOP-level transmission distortion modeling. It is a predictive modeling which allows the encoder to predict the transmission distortion before the whole GOP is compressed and transmitted. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed modeling has low computational complexity and high accuracy. It can be used in allocating the limited channel resources optimally for mobile video applications.	algorithm;cognitive dimensions of notations;computational complexity theory;data compression;distortion;encoder;group of pictures;predictive modelling;real-time transcription;simulation;software propagation;streaming media	Yu Han;Aidong Men;Kan Chang;Ziyi Quan	2009	2009 Fifth International Conference on Information Assurance and Security	10.1109/IAS.2009.107	computer vision;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Robotics	-5.1422191708567375	102.28657880665354	117098

Thus far, separated voice and data networks are being replaced by heterogeneous networks capable of supporting a diverse variety of traffic. Quality of Service (QoS) has become an important factor in the deployment of the next-generation of data networks. The continuing increase in the volumes of data to be carried by ATM networks has boosted the need to administrate the QoS. Although the Connection Admission Control (CAC) algorithm is not specified by the ITU-T, it is still widely used to moderate bandwidth allocation and User Parameter Control (UPC) algorithms can ensure that contractual stipulations are met. However, if an accurate QoS monitoring technique is implemented, both the CAC and UPC mechanisms will have a firmer foundation upon which to base their decisions. This will mean a firmer control on the bandwidth allocation. This paper focuses on the use of data interpretation to monitor the QoS of source bursty traffic based upon delay.	atm turbo;quality of service	A. Abdul Karim Mouharam;Martin J.

Typically, the deployment of VoD is done in an arbitrary manner, without utilizing a proper engineering approach. In this paper, we present an engineering approach to deploy VoD services over IP‐based hospitality networks, such as those networks seen in hotels and hospitals. In particular, our approach aims to determine the total number of VoD sessions that can be sustained by an existing hospitality network, while satisfying the QoS requirements of all network services, and at the same time leaving adequate capacity for future growth. We gauge the capacity of the hospitality network to sustain VoD services using both analysis and simulation. The capacity is gauged considering VoD quality of service requirements of throughput and delay constraints. Our analysis utilizes the principles of queuing theory, and our simulation is performed using OPNET simulation.

Tomographic approaches to detect the location of such problems are not feasible in such cases as active probes can only catch aggregate characteristics. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a Consistent NetFlow (CNF) architecture for measuring per-flow delay measurements within routers. CNF utilizes the existing NetFlow architecture that already reports the first and last timestamps per flow, and it proposes hash-based sampling to ensure that two adjacent routers record the same flows. We devise a novel Multiflow estimator that approximates the intermediate delay samples from other background flows to significantly improve the per-flow latency estimates compared to the naive estimator that only uses actual flow samples. In our experiments using real backbone traces and realistic delay models, we show that the Multiflow estimator is accurate with a median relative error of less than 20% for flows of size greater than 100 packets. We also show that Multiflow estimator performs two to three times better than a prior approach based on trajectory sampling at an equivalent packet sampling rate.	aggregate data;approximation error;conjunctive normal form;experiment;internet backbone;multiflow;network packet;router (computing);sampling (signal processing);simple network management protocol;tracing (software)	Myungjin Lee;Nick G.

34810d74692893e905f908e059b95ecbdc913b25	performance characterization and call reliability diagnosis support for voice over lte	volte;trouble shooting cellular network;qoe;voip	To understand VoLTE performance in a commercial deployment, in this paper we conduct the first comprehensive performance characterization of commercially deployed VoLTE, and compare with legacy call and over-the-top (OTT) VoIP call. We confirm that VoLTE excels in most metrics such as audio quality, but its call reliability still lags behind legacy call for all the three major U.S. operators. We propose an on-device VoLTE problem detection tool, which can capture new types of problems concerning audio quality with high accuracy and minimum overhead, and perform stress testing on VoLTE call's reliability. We discover 3 instances of problems in the early deployment of VoLTE lying in the protocol design and implementation. Although the identified problems are all concerned with the immature LTE coverage in the current deployment, we find that they can cause serious impairment on user experience and are urgent to be solved in the developing stage. For example, one such instance can lead to up to 50-second-long muting problem during a VoLTE call! We perform in-depth cross-layer analysis and find that the causes are rooted in the lack of coordination among protocols designed for different purposes, and invalid assumptions made by protocols used in existing infrastructure when integrated with VoLTE. We summarize learnt lessons and suggest solutions.	communications protocol;compaq lte;over-the-top content;overhead (computing);software deployment;sound quality;stress testing;user experience	Yunhan Jia;Qi Alfred Chen;Zhuoqing Morley Mao;Jie Hui;Kranthi Sontineni;Alex Yoon;Samson Kwong;Kevin Lau	2015		10.1145/2789168.2790095	real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;voice over ip;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-5.633402254225439	91.6564300019525	117463

In this article, we discuss the implications of applying PCN to protect video services, which have less predictable behavior. Several algorithms for protecting video services in multimedia access networks are described. Through performance evaluation, we show the impact of these algorithms on the network utilization and video quality, and present guidelines on how to configure a PCN system.	access network;algorithm;control system;network congestion;performance evaluation;program composition notation;video	Steven Latré;Klaas Roobroeck;Tim Wauters;Filip De Turck	2011	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2011.6094011	layout;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;video quality;service quality;bandwidth;computer network;access network	Networks	-7.119697134379679	98.4570542947372	117598

The authors are developing an ATIS operational field test called SWIFT (Seattle wide-area information for travelers) in the Seattle metropolitan area which uses technological advances in wireless communication, personal digital assistants (PDA), and traffic modeling and analysis. SWIFT uses an advanced 19 kbps FM subcarrier broadcast medium for the delivery of transportation information as well as personal paging information.

c86e1a01f1e05fa4c846d1aad2a1b65fe3d101f0	introduction: wdm transport networks: key elements and architectures	transportation networks	Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) is a primary technique to utilize the huge bandwidth of optical ®ber. Multiple WDM channels can be carried on a single ®ber simultaneously, so allowing a signi®cant increase in the transmission capacity. As a matter of fact, WDM technology made possible the realization of high-capacity point-to-point link using the existing ®ber infrastructure. Among the different approaches towards the realization of high-capacity, protocol-transparent optical networks, WDM offers the most promising way in the near term. Networks based on WDM technology appear well suited for providing ̄exible backbone networks. In fact, at the time being, high-capacity local, regional, and national optical transport networks utilizing WDM technology are emerging at an accelerated rate worldwide. In a WDM network, it is possible to route data channels to their respective destinations based on their wavelengths. Some networking functions, can be achieved directly in the optical domain, without any opto/ electronic conversion. This special issue brings together several papers that address key aspects relating to WDM transport networks. In the ®rst tutorial paper, I tried to brie ̄y review the key elements for WDM transport networks. The paper from P. Batchelor et al., reports the main outcomes of the European research project COST 239, aiming at an optical transparent transport networks in the European environment. Different key issues relating to optical networking are addressed in this paper, from the transmission aspects up to the network design approaches. The paper from P. Arijs is focused on ring networks. It deals with several types of optical ring structures, and discusses the planning issues related to these networks, giving mathematical models as well as methods for the ring loading and wavelength assignment problem. A new optical cross-connect architecture is reported in the paper from I. Tomkos et al., based on a technique that rends the optical node modular, cost effective, and strictly transparent. The use of a particular type of wavelength converter is analyzed and discussed. The issue of optical packet switching is treated in two papers. Namely, the paper from T.-S. Wang reports on two types of WDM-based bufferless optical interconnection networks, for connecting multiple electronic packet switch modules. Both the types are analyzed and discussed; while the paper from V. Eramo and M. Listanti deals with the issue of optical packet switch dimensioning. In particular, the latter paper proposes a dimensioning technique that allows the number of wavelength converters to be reduced, and the signal quality to be improved by reducing unnecessary optical conversions. Two key technological elements are discussed in the two invited papers. In fact, the paper from D. Campi reviews the technologies that can be utilized for the realization of wavelength converters, while the paper from R. O'Dowd, deals with tunable and agile laser transmitters, which are key devices for future Dense WDM optical networks.	agile software development;assignment problem;digital cross connect system;interconnection;internet backbone;mathematical model;network packet;network planning and design;optical cross-connect;packet switching;point-to-point protocol;point-to-point (telecommunications);token ring;transmitter;wavelength-division multiplexing	Roberto Sabella	2000	Photonic Network Communications	10.1023/A:1010018406029	embedded system;telecommunications;computer science	Networks	-20.134748150078746	90.7735136303133	117979

The proposed algorithm estimates the coding parameters of lost frames by combining forward and backward prediction from the good frames before and after the lost frames. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on the ITU-T G.729 coder, and it is compared with the performance of the conventional algorithms in terms of objective and subjective quality measures. From the PESQ score comparison and the listening test, it is found that the proposed algorithm provides better voice quality than the conventional ones.	algorithm	Mi Suk Lee;Hong Kook Kim;Seung Ho Choi;Eung Don Lee;Do-Young Kim	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-30542-2_47	mean opinion score;speech recognition;phonation;telecommunications;computer science;voice over ip;wireless multimedia extensions;computer network	Networks	-5.959397667370608	99.02885348263182	118159

For the air interface, the framework of the UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Time Division Duplex (UTRA TDD) standard has been selected as the most promising candidate. In this paper the requirements and challenges for synchronization in an ad hoc network with rapidly changing topology and high velocities are discussed. Solutions for synchronization in ad hoc networks based on UTRA TDD are proposed and evaluated by means of link-level simulations. The results indicate promising performance with only minor changes to the UTRA TDD standard specifications.	access time;duplex (telecommunications);hoc (programming language);requirement;simulation;telematics;terrestrial television;test-driven development	André Ebner;Hermann Rohling;Rüdiger Halfmann;Matthias Lott	2002		10.1109/PIMRC.2002.1045459	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-16.11896489708821	90.69784462230409	118460

In recent years, there has also been an interest to extend the MPLS capability to the wireless access networks. In this paper, we provide an overview of the MPLS-based micro-mobility management including label switching path setup, packet forwarding, handoff processing, and paging. In order to prevent packet loss during handoff, we propose a medium access protocol (MAC) layer assisted packet recovery scheme. A MAC buffer in the old base station caches the packets dropped by MAC layer and forwards these packets to the new base station. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme can eliminate the packet loss due to handoff and improve the TCP throughput dramatically when compared with IP micro-mobility protocols including cellular IP, HAWAII, and hierarchical mobile IP.	access network;multiprotocol label switching	Kaiduan Xie;Vincent W.

The service is based on a novel auction-based flexible pricing scheme, where the flexibility is expressed in terms of client-supplied budget functions that represent the upper bound on the bandwidth unit price the client is willing to pay, as a function of time. This flexibility allows for the admission control and the bandwidth maintenance policies of the scheme to be decentralized. The policies are implemented by the involved switches in a distributed fashion, such that the clients do not need to participate so long as their budget functions remain competitive. We define four measures of flow satisfaction in terms of the quality and the price. We have performed a comprehensive simulation study of the scheme that confirms its positive qualities. One of the main observations is that clients benefit financially when choosing flexible budget functions, when compared to clients that use fixed budget functions and that achieve similar quality of service. Flexible flows achieving 90% throughput satisfaction can save from 7% to 12% in bandwidth unit price, and flows that may be content with lower satisfaction can save up to 46%.	network switch;quality of service;simulation;throughput	Grzegorz Malewicz;Alexander A.

We have the opportunity of not committing this error in vehicular networks. Apart from particular works in the literature, ETSI TC ITS has defined general security services for (vehicular) cooperative systems. However, existent efforts do not pay the needed attention to the integration of IPv6 yet. The potential of IPv6 in the field is being described within ISO TC 204, above all, but further work is needed for a proper integration of security. This work follows this direction, and a reference vehicular communication architecture considering ETSI/ISO regulations, uses Internet Protocol security (IPsec) and Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) to secure IPv6 Network Mobility (NEMO). A key advance is also the implementation and experimental evaluation of the proposal in a challenging vertical handover scenario between 3G and 802.11p. The performance of the secured NEMO channel is widely analyzed in terms of the movement speed, bandwidth, traffic type or signal quality, and it is concluded that the addition of IPv6 security only implies a slight reduction in the overall performance, with the great advantage of providing confidentiality, integrity and authenticity to the communication path.	confidentiality;consensus dynamics;ipsec;iso/iec 646;internet key exchange;proxy mobile ipv6	Pedro J.

To meet users' requirements for high-quality video delivery, it is an urgent task to provide fair-quality video delivery for various users and situations. In this paper, we evaluate QoS and QoE characteristics and validate QoE unfriendliness in heterogeneous DASH contents distributions to provide QoE-fair video delivery,. In the evaluations, we employ multiple contents with different resolutions, frame rates, and rate-distortion characteristics. By using heterogeneous DASH contents, we evaluate the effect of playout buffer size on QoS and QoE performances. Evaluation results show that smaller playout buffer size contributes to QoE improvement under network congestion. In addition, we confirm that suppression of playback stall is a particularly important factor to achieve QoE fairness compared to other QoS metrics such as initial delay and representation.	distortion;fairness measure;mobile app;network congestion;performance;playout;quality of service;requirement;zero suppression	Tatsuya Nagashima;Kenji Kanai;Jiro Katto	2017	2017 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia (ISM)	10.1109/ISM.2017.90	management science;computer science;quality of service;dash;quality of experience;network congestion;frame rate;computer network	Arch	-8.428266211545933	99.85487100274928	119451

Our goal is to help players and network providers to estimate the amount of traffic caused by the game and the impact on access links or provider networks. It also enables other researchers to use a realistic Halo 2 traffic model in network simulations. We focus on the following characteristics: bandwidth, packet rate and distribution of packet inter-arrival times and packet lengths. We compare the results with a previous analysis of Halo 1 and find some major differences - the client packet rate has been reduced, packet sizes have no longer a single fixed value per game and the mean packet size has decreased (so Halo 2 requires less bandwidth). Finally we develop traffic simulation models for Halo 2 and compare them against the experimentally obtained data.	experiment;network packet;simulation	Sebastian Zander;Grenville J.

The first challenge is to reconstruct an unambiguous set of packet trajectories from the reports on sampled packets received at a collector. In this paper we extend the reporting paradigm of trajectory sampling to enable the elimination of ambiguous groups of reports, but without introducing bias into any characterization of traffic based on the surviving reports. Even after the elimination, a proportion of trajectories are incomplete due to report loss. A second challenge is to adapt measurement based applications (including network engineering, path tracing, and passive performance measurement) to incomplete trajectories. To achieve this, we propose a method to join multiple incomplete trajectories for inference, and analyze its performance. We also show how applications can distinguish between packet and report loss at the statistical level.	sampling (signal processing)	Nick G. Duffield;Matthias Grossglauser	2008	IEEE/ACM Trans.

Network interfaces are among the most power hungry components in these devices. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of a client-centric protocol for energy efficiency. Inspired by earlier work, our protocol works by exploiting the TCP flow-control mechanism to shape incoming traffic into bursts in order to utilize the unused bandwidth between the server and the client. Our solution works with multiple simultaneous connections and it is extensible to different scheduling policies. Furthermore, the purely client-centric nature of the protocol enables easier deployment of the solution. The protocol is application independent and it is targeted for bulky TCP transfers. The solution can be used on Linux based systems and is kept portable as it can be deployed with different wireless devices without major modifications. We have tested our solution with real web-servers and our results show that the protocol can achieve sleep time up to 80 percent and 45percent of total duration of one and four active simultaneous connections, respectively.	linux;network interface;noise shaping;scheduling (computing);server (computing);software deployment;web server	Ahmad Nazir Raja;Zhihua Jin;Matti Siekkinen	2010	2010 IEEE/ACM Int'l Conference on Green Computing and Communications & Int'l Conference on Cyber, Physical and Social Computing	10.1109/GreenCom-CPSCom.2010.135	embedded system;real-time computing;computer science;transmission control protocol;zeta-tcp;tcp acceleration;computer network	Mobile	-7.215064166871633	91.84528507627229	119552

Today, the need for desktop videoconferencing is experiencing robust growth in both business and consumer markets. However, the synchronous delivery of high-volume media content is still a big challenge under a current heterogeneous Internet environment. In this paper, we present a multiparty videoconferencing system based on a peer-to-peer (P2P) solution. The contribution of our paper is twofold. On the one hand, we design an application-level multicast scheme which intends to tolerate the heterogeneity in videoconferencing applications. Design tradeoffs are analyzed and our decisions are made based on extensive experimentation. On the other, we design a five-layer architecture for implementing a multiparty videoconferencing system. This architecture makes a clear-cut distinction between different functional modules and therefore provides rich flexibility in feature adaptation. We believe that our work can be a helpful reference in other efforts on building desktop videoconferencing systems.	desktop computer;experiment;internet;multicast;peer-to-peer	Chong Luo;Wei Wang;Jian Tang;Jun Sun;Jiang Li	2007	IEEE Transactions on Multimedia	10.1109/TMM.2007.907467	multicast;the internet;teleconference;network architecture;index term;consumer;information processing;telecommunications;computer science;multitier architecture;heterogeneity;peer-to-peer;multimedia;videoconferencing;world wide web;computer network	Networks	-16.51398585842041	97.62181978413804	119695

Simply put, telecom network architectures need to evolve to support an exponentially more complex and diverse set of applications. Not surprisingly, this challenge has been attracting ever increasing attention from researchers in both academia and industry, including telecom standards experts. As enablers of global systems interoperability, standards are at the heart of success of the communications industry. Since standardization is inherently a social enterprise, it is the perfect environment for promoting technologies that underpin an increasingly social world. Moreover, telecommunications-oriented standards development organizations such as the IEEE, Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), and others have a decades-long track record as drivers of real technological change across the industry.	cloud computing;emergence;internet of things;interoperability;social reality	Tarik Taleb;Adlen Ksentini;Alex Reznik;Thijs Metsch	2014	IEEE Wireless Communications	10.1109/MWC.2014.6845043	telecommunications;computer science	DB	-18.1056283114215	96.61200301822952	120215

In this work, we define a framework for the comparison of these applications, based on the measurement and analysis of the traffic they generate. In order for the framework to be descriptive for all P2P applications, we first define a minimum set of observables of interest: such features either pertain to different layers of the protocol stack (from network up to the application), or convey cross-layer information (such as the degree of awareness, at overlay layer, of properties characterizing the underlying physical network). The framework is compact (as it allows to represent all the above information at once), general (as is can be extended to consider features different from the one reported in this work), and flexible in both space and time (as it allows different levels of spatial aggregation, and also to represent the temporal evolution of the quantities of interest). Using the minimum feature set, we analyze some of the most popular P2P application nowadays, highlighting their main similarities and differences. We then apply the framework, using also different features and metrics, to two interesting case study: namely, the detection of malfunctioning or misbehaving peers, and a fine-grained analysis of P2P networkawareness and friendliness.	anomaly detection;black box;centrality;data (computing);file sharing;internet;observable;peer-to-peer;protocol stack;spatial variability;streaming media;traffic analysis	Dario Rossi;Elisa Sottile;Paolo Veglia	2011	Peer-to-Peer Networking and Applications	10.1007/s12083-010-0072-4	anomaly detection;computer science;operating system;peer-to-peer;data mining;database;world wide web;computer security;file sharing;computer network	Metrics	-10.456815347775436	97.54437201471717	120233

The final result of the project is to obtain an objective indicator of video quality and direct subjective measures, based on the average opinion of the audience. For the subjective measurements, the concept of crowdsourcing for TV is introduced. They are performed through an Interactive TV application using Ginga middleware. The paper includes a brief discussion on the treatment of packet loss for DTV, and a description of a new application for smartphones developed to input the ratings in subjective test sessions which simplifies processing of results and minimizes errors.	codec;crowdsourcing;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;isdb;image noise;middleware;network packet;real-time computing;smartphone;video	Rafael G.

However, a location update message is required to be sent to the home agent for each new connection. This will potentially increase the handoff latency and leads to high load on the global Internet. This paper presents the concepts and the challenges of Mobile IP networks and then proposes the use of OpenFlow approach as an alternate transport mechanism to perform routing and to provide network connectivity for Mobile IP networks. The proposed application determines calculations and reroutes the subsequent packets. OpenFlow aims to optimize routing path and handoff performance by using controller's application and exchanges controllers' information.	algorithm;care-of address;experiment;internet protocol suite;mobile ip;mobile app;openflow;pervasive informatics;routing;seamless3d	Pakawat Pupatwibul;Ameen Banjar;Abdallah Al Sabbagh;Robin Braun	2013	38th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks - Workshops	10.1109/LCNW.2013.6758535	reserved ip addresses;openflow;virtual routing and forwarding;routing;loose source routing;bogon filtering;the internet;next-generation network;ip address management;computer science;software agent;optical ip switching;ip forwarding;distributed computing;network address translation;software-defined networking;ip tunnel;triangular routing;mobile computing;computer security;mobile ip;computer network	Mobile	-11.244336442911772	89.60790864386969	120611

For large-scale cost- effective monitoring, using inexpensive motes as sniffers is an attractive choice. In this paper, we quantify the capability and fidelity of mote-class sniffers for sensor network monitoring. In particular, we experimentally quantify the sustainable workload and the accuracy of delay and loss measurements by these types of sniffers. We find that (1) a sniffer can monitor traffic at the rate of 60 packets per second with little buffer overflow, (2) per-hop loss measurements from sniffers exhibit variations but are comparable to those at the receiver and (3) per-hop delay measurements from a sniffer are accurate (the errors are up to 300 μs). Our results indicate that measurement quality by mote-class sniffers is satisfactory for many monitoring purposes.	approximation algorithm;buffer overflow;experiment;interference (communication);logic analyzer;packet analyzer;queueing theory;sensor node;throughput	Jordan Cote;Bing Wang;Wei Zeng;Zhijie Jerry Shi	2010	2010 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference GLOBECOM 2010	10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683714	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;statistics;computer network	Mobile	-5.599390631095345	90.06859305775322	120841

Its design aims to overcome DCCP weaknesses when the Server is behind a middle box, such as Network Address Translators or firewalls. The original DCCP specification, RFC 4340, only allows the Client to initiate the call. The call request cannot reach the Server behind the middle box. A widely used solution to address this problem is called the “hole punching” technique. This technique requires the Server to initiate sending packets. Using Coloured Petri Nets (CPN) this paper models and analyses the DCCP procedure specified in RFC 5596. However, the difficulty is that detailed modelling of the address translation is also required. This causes state space explosion. We alleviate the state explosion using prioritized transitions and the sweep-line technique. Modelling and analysis approaches are discussed in the hope that it is helpful for others who wish to analyse similar protocols. Analysis results are also obtained for the simultaneous-open procedure specified in RFC 5596. 1998 ACM Subject Classification C.2.2 Network Protocols, D.2.2 Design Tools and Techniques, D.2.4 Software/Program Verification	coloured petri net;datagram;firewall (computing);formal verification;network address;network packet;state space;sweep line algorithm;udp hole punching	Somsak Vanit-Anunchai	2013		10.4230/OASIcs.FSFMA.2013.3	telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Embedded	-24.16186962148406	89.11463087279775	120892

However, Internet video often suffers from packet loss and jitter, degrading the user’s perceived quality of the video. Understanding the effects of delay, loss and jitter on media quality is critical for choosing delay buffer sizes and packet repair techniques. While the effects of packet loss on perceptual quality are well-understood, to date there have not been careful user studies measuring the impact of jitter on perceptual quality. The major contributions of this work are carefully designed experiments that measure and compare the impact of both jitter and packet loss on perceptual quality of packet video. We find that jitter degrades perceptual quality nearly as much as does packet loss, and that perceptual quality degrades sharply even with low 1eveIs of jitter or packet loss as compared to perceptual quality for perfect video.	desktop computer;experiment;internet;network packet;usability testing	Mark Claypool;Jonathan Tanner	1999		10.1145/319878.319909	media delivery index;real-time computing;computer science;operating system;multimedia;packet loss;scheduling;computer network	Networks	-7.232095511432206	99.35913328612682	121093

However, getting access to those fixed networks must be controlled and only authorized users should be able to use those RSUs or gateways. However, that authentication process incurs in a not-negligible delay which can result in packet losses and other issues during handoffs. In this paper we assess the performance benefit provided by pre-authentication schemes in which vehicles use the current gateway to authenticate with nearby gateways before they finally attach to them. Our simulation results show that pre- authentication offers important benefits in terms of packet delivery ratio and handoff delays both in urban and inter-urban scenarios.	access control;authentication;authorization;gateway (telecommunications);internet protocol suite;network packet;overhead (computing);simulation	Juan A.

However, today there is no solution that allows network operators or CDN providers to perform network-based QoE monitoring for HAS sessions. We present a HAS QoE monitoring system, based on data collected in the network, without monitoring information from the client. To retrieve the major QoE parameters such as average quality, quality variation, rebuffering events and interactivity delay, we propose a technique called session reconstruction. We define a number of iterative steps and developed algorithms that can be used to perform HAS session reconstruction. Finally, we present the results of a working prototype for the reconstruction and monitoring of Microsoft Smooth Streaming HAS sessions that is capable of dealing with intermediate caching and user interactivity. We describe the main observations when using the platform to analyze more than a hundred HAS sessions.	algorithm;content delivery network;hypertext transfer protocol;interactivity;iterative method;prototype;session (web analytics);streaming media	Rafael Huysegems;Bart De Vleeschauwer;Koen De Schepper;Chris Hawinkel;Tingyao Wu;Koenraad Laevens;Werner Van Leekwijck	2012	2012 IEEE 20th International Workshop on Quality of Service	10.1109/IWQoS.2012.6245987	cellular network;quality of service;computer science;multimedia;world wide web;transport layer;computer network;data collection	Mobile	-9.987988090474689	96.9680309537115	121300

We present a novel architecture that explores the interoperability issues between Wi-Fi hotspots and packet cellular networks. In the presence of multiple wireless networks with different access costs, different areas of coverage and bandwidth, the user's choice to select a particular network can significantly impact user benefits and resource usage. We identify three major user profiles - bandwidth conscious, cost conscious and glitch conscious - and study their impact on resource utilization. Contrary to intuition, simulation experiments have shown that bandwidth conscious users may get fewer bandwidth resources compared to glitch conscious users at high mobility. Similarly, it was found that bandwidth conscious users achieve high packet delivery ratios, even while incurring lower costs than cost conscious users, in certain situations. Although increasing the number of access points (APs) leads to higher packet delivery ratios, system performance degrades when the number of APs becomes very large.	bandwidth (signal processing);byte;consciousness;data rate units;emergence;experiment;frequency band;glitch;hotspot (wi-fi);interoperability;network packet;simulation;systems architecture;user profile;wireless access point	Dilip Antony Joseph;B.

The FMIPv6 proposes some procedures for fast movement detection and fast binding update to minimize the handover latency. Additionally, to reduce the lost packets caused by a handover, this protocol introduces buffers in access routers. However, the handover latency or the amount of lost packets are affected by the time to send signals such as Fast Binding Update message for the fast handover. In this paper, we inspect the impacts of the signaling time on packet loss and handover latency in FMIPv6 through the numerical analysis, we propose the optimal signaling time to improve the performance of FMIPv6 in terms of the handover latency and lost packets.	mobile ip;network packet;numerical analysis;router (computing)	Seung-Hee Hwang;Youn-Hee Han;Jung-Hoon Han;Chong-Sun Hwang	2004			signalling;working group;telecommunications;numerical analysis;computer science;handover;packet loss;computer security;soft handover;computer network	Metrics	-10.255579401810397	89.82683275343854	121509

The proposed adaptive transport scheme controls the amount of redundancy by monitoring the network so that it can effectively adapt to the fluctuations of underlying networks. The monitored feedbacks of the receiver enable the sender to aware of current reception status (i.e., rate/type of packet loss and delay change) and to estimate the expected network status. Based on this, the proposed media transport attempts to enable reliability by adaptively controlling the amount of both total sending rate and the FEC code ratio. Experiments with high-speed network have been conducted to verify the performance of the proposed transport that demonstrates the enhanced reliability at the speed of up to several hundred Mbps.	data rate units;error detection and correction;feedback;forward error correction;network packet;quantum fluctuation;streaming media	Young-Woo Kwon;Hyeyoung Chang;JongWon Kim	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-30542-2_45	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;forward error correction;packet loss;statistics;computer network	HPC	-5.721061226270504	98.80833116175097	121675

Users want to access the video data anytime, anywhere, which sets challenges in the highly-loaded network to provide best possible video quality for the end user. Naturally, in the era of high-definition, users want to experience high quality from their mobile devices even when the channel capacity fluctuates drastically due to congestion. Video adaptation to bandwidth fluctuations plays an important role in modern video transmission in order to maximize the best available video quality, but again to use available bandwidth efficiently. In this paper, we aim to find the best strategy for how the adaptation should be performed, to find sufficient adaptation period and number of layers that maximize the compression efficiency, usage of channel resources and objective quality in video streaming. For the compression, we utilize Scalable Video Coding (SVC), which provides layered video structure and enables video adaptation to bandwidth fluctuations. The results indicate that long adaptation period with complex content encoded for two enhancement layers brings essential channel savings while also maintaining the compression efficiency and objective quality in adequate level.	anytime algorithm;channel capacity;display resolution;hdmi;mobile device;network congestion;scalable video coding;streaming media	Mikko Uitto;Janne Vehkaperä	2013	IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology	10.1109/ISSPIT.2013.6781857	data compression;scalable video coding;uncompressed video;telecommunications;computer science;video tracking;mathematics;multimedia;video processing;channel capacity;bandwidth;statistics;computer network	Arch	-8.362270829598797	100.17319798273834	121754

At the same time, increasing diversity and density of network access technologies has made the goal of providing connectivity anytime and anywhere a real possibility. Another important development is the emergence of small, low-complexity user owned networks, such as personal area networks and body area networks. Dynamic interworking, also known as network composition, between networks of different types and sizes is essential in the push towards convergence, as well as to realize truly seamless connectivity between heterogeneous access networks. Dynamic interworking requires signalling between different elements of the control planes of the different networks in order to coordinate the control functions and resources of the networks concerned. In this paper, we present the generic ambient network signalling protocol suite to address the diverse signalling requirements for dynamic interworking of networks.	access network;ambient network;anytime algorithm;control function (econometrics);emergence;protocol stack;requirement;seamless3d;signaling protocol	Nadeem Akhtar;Rui Campos;Cornelia Kappler;Pekka Pääkkönen;Petteri Pöyhönen;Di Zhou	2006	IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VTCF.2006.560	heterogeneous network;index term;evolving networks;telecommunications;computer science;personal area network;body area network;distributed computing;computer network;access network	HPC	-15.275277333196343	91.10238862201697	121997

However, the cost of content delivery, in particular, multimedia type content over cellular networks is still high and poses a challenge for some users who are not necessarily willing or cannot afford to pay too much for it. The problem is further exacerbated when video content is used, as this type of content is heavier and can lead to higher bills. In this context, this paper presents a novel cost-oriented adaptive multimedia delivery (COMEDY) mechanism that considers the user's willingness to pay for a certain video quality and user's mobile device characteristics to deliver adaptive multimedia content over wireless connection. The goal of the mechanism is to reduce the cost of multimedia delivery for users that are not willing to pay that much. The mechanism is evaluated both through objective and subjective studies. The evaluation shows that the proposed mechanism provides a reduction in the price paid for accessing multimedia content, and the user's perceived quality is not negatively affected.	concordance (publishing);digital distribution;digital video;display resolution;electronic billing;image resolution;low-definition television;mobile device;mobile payment;mobile phone;network congestion;peak signal-to-noise ratio;personalization;proxy server;server (computing);structural similarity;video clip;welch's method	Andreea Molnar;Cristina Hava Muntean	2013	IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting	10.1109/TBC.2013.2244786	mobile search;the internet;computer science;multimedia;internet privacy;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	-10.70833381555065	99.97562410776732	122374

Upgrading of network devices so as they can allow scalable and full line rate traffic aggregation and eliminate any internal performance bottlenecks is crucial. In packet switching devices, since data plane functionalities need to be executed for each incoming packet and power per given bandwidth is strongly related to the amount of processing on this data, packet processing at ultra-high rate is becoming the major challenge. The main trend to address such power consumption and scalability issues is to bypass packet switches by switching traffic at lower layers. This results in the packet optical transport network approach, where packet switching provides flexible end-to-end connectivity based on tunnel encapsulation while wavelength switching, exploiting optical bypass, allows reducing electrical switch size at transit nodes. There are also opportunities consisting in simplifying packet switch functionalities or designing completely different packet switch architectures. In this paper a new Ethernet aggregation and switching solution with potentialities to simplify and scale Ethernet switch forwarding functionality is proposed. This solution, based on a burst-basis transmission compliant with the Ethernet Standard, is able to maintain flexibility and any to any connectivity deriving from the connectionless nature of Ethernet. At the same time, it provides Ethernet technology with efficient aggregation capabilities allowing to reduce processing of transit traffic. This is allowed thanks to an Ethernet burst structure conceived as a variable number of consecutive frames of the same connection preceded by a proprietary burst control frame carrying information necessary for burst data frames classification. As a result, burst control frames experience the conventional Ethernet switch packet processing while data frames are mapped on the corresponding queue/output port according to the result of control frames classification. The proposed solution also provides the possibility to recognize data frames of the same burst through a proprietary inter-frame gap inserted among them; that allows to dynamically adapt burst size to the available bandwidth at transit nodes in order to limit frame delay and jitter and to support intermediate grooming. These features make it a very competitive approach in the context of packet optical transport being able to support dynamic multi-granular switching. The proposed solution has been validated by estimating its efficiency in terms of energy consumption with respect to a commercial packet switch. The impact of burst transmission on packet delay and jitter across ring and mesh networks has been also evaluated through different sets of simulations.

We propose to mitigate this problem with a two-level edge-based solution that incentivizes users to moderate their bandwidth usage based on their actual needs. In the first level, home gateways are given QoE (quality of experience) credits that they can spend to receive more bandwidth at congested times; to ensure fairness, the credits are redistributed to other gateways after they are spent. We show that this scheme guarantees long-term fairness and maximizes users' total satisfaction at the equilibrium. In the second level, each gateway allocates bandwidth among its users and apps according to its own priorities. Gateways can thus customize their bandwidth allocation depending on individual preferences. We develop a prototype of this second-level allocation on commodity wireless routers. We then consider an example scenario and show by simulation and implementation results that our solution outperforms an equal bandwidth allocation, increasing users' overall utility and fairly allocating bandwidth across users.	fairness measure;network congestion;network traffic control;prototype;router (computing);simulation;wireless router	Felix Ming Fai Wong;Carlee Joe-Wong;Sangtae Ha;Zhenming Liu;Mung Chiang	2015	2015 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on Quality of Service (IWQoS)	10.1109/IWQoS.2015.7404720	bandwidth management;network traffic control;real-time computing;telecommunications;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network	Metrics	-7.736905387030331	94.85201085649736	122433

The 'Container' MIB is useful to the Network Management System (NMS) in abstracting information derived from lower network layers and in cross-referencing elements of disparate network layers. The Container MIB is described here in the context of networks which use ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) technology for the backbone. Conceptually, the Container MIB is above the ATM, ADSL, and entity MIBs in the management hierarchy, and bridges between ATM and ADSL network segments. We demonstrate how the Container MIB can be used in the implementation of several unique network management functions endemic to ATM/ADSL networks.© (1998) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

The different characteristics of each wireless technology with regard to Quality of Service (QoS) brought many challenges for provisioning the continuous services (audio/video streaming) in a seamless way. The paper proposes Context-Aware Management Scheme (CAMS) which facilitates service continuity in real-time application such as video and audio streaming. Unlike previous research efforts which focuses on session continuity only while handover and does not account for the characteristics differences between the networks, this work focuses on improving QoS and user experience by adapting the session parameters after Vertical Handover (VHO) according to the new environment and available resources. The new scheme would improve users experience and allow the network to admit more users at the same time compared to non-context aware solutions. In this paper, the architecture of the proposed scheme is presented. In addition, detailed signaling messages of the VHO and Context-Aware Management from WiFi to WiMax and vice versa are discussed.	provisioning;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time computing;scott continuity;seamless3d;streaming media;user experience	Hanan Alhazmi;Nadine Akkari Adra	2012	2012 19th International Conference on Telecommunications (ICT)	10.1109/ICTEL.2012.6221315	real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;wireless network;ubiquitous computing;computer network	Mobile	-12.65990330344922	92.10853213782922	122656

Multimedia services, especially real-time services, require data to arrive on time. Unlike any other transmissions, video streaming needs to be monitored and adapted to bandwidth, when the video stream passes through the best-effort environment. A guaranteed QoS (Quality of Service) is essential in all real-time applications. This paper presents a context aware mechanism, which improves the QoS of real time video transmission, over wireless networks. This proposed RSQA system ensures video availability even when the bandwidth is low. Drawbacks to other solutions for saving bandwidth in real-time include being: (1) too expensive due to requiring a priority based router (in the case of proxy based and frame prioritization approaches); (2) too complex; (3) not appropriate for real-time systems. This RSQA system succeeds in being of low complexity, appropriate for real-time systems and cost effective (not requiring a priority based router to function). This RSQA system is independent of wireless technology making, thus it appropriate for use in a heterogeneous environment as well. Whenever a user experiences packet loss or a delay in receiving a video, the server will be notified about the congestion and decrease the video quality to make the video available at low bandwidth. The decision regarding the needed QoS parameters and the rate control is based on context information (available bandwidth). The RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) based streaming is simulated and verified by an Eclipse simulator and Java using an MJPEG standard. Results show that the QoS parameters of video transmission were improved considerably by this RSQA system.	best-effort delivery;eclipse;internet;java;network congestion;network packet;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;router (computing);server (computing);simulation;streaming media;video clip	S.

Many mobile devices are equipped with multiple network interfaces to be connected. However, there is no mechanism to allow the use of these multiple network interfaces simultaneously. The use of a single network interface at the time is not enough to for today's application requirements. Bandwidth aggregation is a solution to this problem. However, current solutions require the placement of additional infrastructure to the network or the creation of a new transport protocol, which incurs into additional modification of applications. In this paper a solution to this problem is presented by only modifying the Transmission Control Protocol to allow the use of multiple network interfaces to send traffic simultaneously increasing the throughput while being transparent to users and applications.	mobile device;network interface controller;requirement;throughput	Ismael Amezcua Valdovinos;Jesús Arturo Pérez Díaz	2009	2009 Mexican International Conference on Computer Science	10.1109/ENC.2009.28	network traffic control;telecommunications;computer science;mobile device;distributed computing;transport layer;computer network	Mobile	-12.501102597079793	88.97672147318178	122869

To do this, each time a mobile node moves to a new location, iit configures and confirms it temporal IP address. In this paper, we study the impact of the address configuration and confirmation procedure on the their IP handover latency. We first argue that the current strategies for them are unnecessarily slow, hampering the use of current proposals for real-time traffic. We present a new scheme which can be a substitute of the current strategies. The underlying objective of our scheme is to completely eliminate the latency taken by the address configuration and confirmation from the whole handover latency. Further, a mathematical analysis is developed to show the benefits of our scheme. In this analysis, various parameters are discussed to analyze the existing proposals, while our approach focuses on the reduction of handover latency.	mobile ip;network packet;real-time clock;real-time computing;routing;seamless3d	Youn-Hee Han;Seung-Hee Hwang;Heejin Jang	2004	2004 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (IEEE Cat.

Since checkpointing is expensive, the focus of the scheme is to add only a low overhead to the normal application execution by reducing the number of checkpoints taken by a mobile host. For accomplishing this, the mobile system is divided into regions and a checkpoint is taken once when a mobile node enters a region and at most once while it moves within that region. The simulation results show that the scheme works well for large systems where the inter region movement of mobile hosts will be less as compared to intra region movement The recovery scheme is free from domino effect and aims to reduce the number of recovery related messages exchanged over the wireless media as well as the size of recovery related data stored with a mobile host. We show the correctness and effectiveness of our protocol in this presentation and demonstrate the simulation results.	application checkpointing;correctness (computer science);mobile computing;overhead (computing);simulation;transaction processing system	Parmeet Kaur Jaggi;Awadhesh Kumar Singh	2013	J.

We develop an analytical model to capture the fundamental trade-offs in this system. This model is then used to characterize the potential savings from transcoding the unicast stream. Analysis and simulation results show that the stream compression factor affects linearly the saving in the channel change latency, and superlinearly the saving in unicast burst duration (or data size).	iptv;retransmission (data networks);simulation;unicast	Zhi Li;Ali C.

Simple IP based services like email and web browsing were, during many years, the typical services provided to residential customers. Today the telecommunications market is changing and operators are looking for ways to provide, through those same IP broadband connections, value added services. These will, in one hand, increase their revenues and on the other hand, provide to the customer a wider range of services until now inaccessible. Triple Play is already a reality, although, the convergence between mobile and fixed networks is bringing to the home a new range of IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) based services, which used to be exclusive of the mobile world. Although, to successfully achieve the delivery of these new services, the interface between residential and operator’s networks must be meticulously defined and implemented, by what is usually called the residential gateway (RGW). This paper focuses on emerging residential services and the implications that these impose on the RGW. The coexistence between IMS based services and non-IMS based services are also approached on this paper, with a special emphasis on RGW Quality of Service (QoS) issues.	coexist (image);email;ip multimedia subsystem;internet access;play store;quality of service;residential gateway	Vitor Pinto;Vitor Ribeiro;Iván Vidal;Jaime García-Reinoso;Francisco Valera;Arturo Azcorra	2007			sealant;computer vision;computer network;artificial intelligence;computer science;default gateway;spark plug;mechanical engineering	Networks	-18.16574006555738	95.0848165335344	123202

Thus, providing integrated service for WNs could lead to high traffic and instable performance because of the high link error. However, some application signaling protocols transport information about their resource requirements; this information is similar to that transported by QoS-signaling protocol. The usage of these application signaling protocols to perform a kind of QoS can reduce the control traffic generated on the wireless side effectively. In this respect, new structure of QoS is presented, where a wireless access server (WAS) communicates with the applications server, and the base stations in order to provide a kind of QoS. This method is applied on SIP-based WLAN telephony. The experiments on our implemented software presented relatively small delay times, in average: 13 ms for flow reservation and 16 ms for updating the wireless state in WAS. This provides an effective structure of QoS for VoIP applications.	quality of service	Robil Daher;Djamshid Tavangarian;Abbas Malekpour	2005		10.1007/11749776_15	internet protocol;innovation;active traffic management;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;base station;wireless network;session initiation protocol;integrated services;wi-fi array;telephony;computer security;service quality;voice;side effect;bandwidth;application server;computer network	Mobile	-13.629237135691776	95.7439463080157	123255
ad8cb40ec14740677a575566161d213de8e9817a	on the cost of cloud-assistance in tree-structured p2p live streaming		Consider a cloud-assisted Peer-to-Peer (P2P) video streaming system, in which a given video stream of a unit bit rate is divided into several stripes and is delivered to all subscribing peers through different spanning trees of height two each, with the aid of the cloud bandwidth. We call such a low latency delivery of stripes a 2-hop delivery of the stripes. In this paper, we prove that if the average upload bandwidth of the peers equals to one and the video stream is divided into a stripes, then 2-hop delivery of the stream to n subscribing peers is possible if the additional bandwidth provided by the cloud is at least 2n/a. This result indicates that the cloud assistance is effective to realize a scalable, dependable P2P video streaming system, while the cost of cloud assistance can be arbitrarily small as the number of stripes increases.	file spanning;peer-to-peer;scalability;streaming media;stripes;upload	Satoshi Fujita	2018	2018 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW)	10.1109/IPDPSW.2018.00129	computer science;latency (engineering);cloud computing;network topology;scalability;distributed computing;live streaming;upload;spanning tree;bandwidth (signal processing)	Arch	-8.872949866419955	103.68433452610265	123274

Compressed video is packetized into individually decodable packets of equal expected visual importance. Consequently, relatively constant video quality can be achieved at the receiver under lossy conditions. Furthermore, the packets can be truncated to instantaneously meet the time varying bandwidth imposed by a TCP-friendly transport protocol. As a result, adaptive flows that are friendly to other Internet traffic are produced. Actual Internet experiments together with simulations are used to evaluate the performance of the compression, transport, and the combined schemes.	experiment;internet;lossy compression;real-time clock;real-time transcription;scalability;simulation;video	Wai-tian Tan;Avideh Zakhor	1999	IEEE Trans.

2b10da5b1c355964dc5f005c47de8e951190e8b4	network-based business process management: a discussion on embedding business logic in communications networks	economies of scale;business process;business process management	Advanced Business Process Management (BPM) tools enable the decomposition of previously integrated and often ill-defined processes into reusable process modules. These process modules can subsequently be distributed on the Internet over a variety of many different actors, each with their own specialization and economies-of-scale. The economic benefits of process specialization can be huge. However, how should such actors in a business network find, select, and control, the best partner for what part of the business process, in such a way that the best result is achieved? This particular management challenge requires more advanced techniques and tools in the enabling communications networks. An approach has been developed to embed business logic into the communications networks in order to optimize the allocation of business resources from a network point of view. Initial experimental results have been encouraging while at the same time demonstrating the need for more robust techniques in a future of massively distributed business processes. 1 Evolution of business process management (BPM) architectures The new BPM systems make it possible to define process logic as an applications program and run this on different 'organisational environments' (that is, different computer systems and application programs, and different human interactions in the process flows). This approach has particular attractions to business and technologists. Processes can be properly defined in a runtime environment. Previous process modelling languages and tools often resulted in prescriptive recipes, were difficult, time-consuming and costly to implement. Now we can define and build small process modules, which can be templates in an organisational library, can be integrated within a complete process, plug-and-play in different environments, can be re-used, easily changed, and continually improved. Processes can be improved gradually: existing processes are viewed as black-boxes, so the BPM logic defines a certain expected behavior, or norm, of present computer systems and human beings. Deviations from the expected norm are reported to the process management console while the BPM kernel event manager keeps track of all process events and flows. The behavior of processes can be governed by rule-engines so that process results can be changed very quickly and in a controlled way. Outsourcing of elements of business processes is made easy and manage-able as well as insourcing or service provisioning to business partners and others. In this paper we argue that changes in BPM's, but above all that a technical integration of the BPM execution networks and environments, enable to reduce duplication in modularized business processes and their support systems, and therefore to run business processes more efficiently and with more flexibility. For example, client authentication and credit checking do not need to be caried twice in the mobile networks and in the banking transactions processing systems, so they can be moved from financial institutions to communication operators or vice-versa. The paper suggests therefore to go with the technical current and to move major elements of business process logic (such as authentication and credit checking) into communication nodes for more flexible and efficient execution. Client behavior and regulatory rules as well as other changes are anticipated. This “embedding” has an explicit link to BPS; for example, the network of actors that collectively execute a business process can be seen as a BPS. The changes proposed to this BPS and the anticipated changes in the business environment are clearly associated with fit/alignment. 2 From business process to business network Once process logic can be abstracted from its runtime environment it is possible to divide process modules over a number of different actors defined as organizational entities that are connected together via a communications infrastructure (see Figure 1). Fig. 1. According to the Modular Network Design of business interactions, each actor pledges process modules (defined as service elements and production elements) that can be linked together to satisfy a defined customer order [1]. Generally, one of the major stumbling blocks to swift process co-ordination is the distribution of business and process logic over actors at the outside of the network. The business problem of path finding and resource allocation is also very similar to the issues surrounding naming/ addressing/ routing and capacity utilization in traditional communications network design and management. This paper endeavours a novel approach to embedding business logic into the control layers of communications networks. 3 The business Process impact of on-the-fly user-driven management of communication architectures 3.1. Transport and signalling networks What has been little realized outside technical circles within communications equipment suppliers or communication service suppliers, is that historically voice and data flows have obeyed two underlying design principles: a) the separation of transport and content (voice, data), although specific protocols and quality of service can regulate properties of the flows based on the application requirements;today this extends to the regulatory definition of backbone network operators and access network operators on one hand, and content providers on the other hand; b) the separation of the transport networks from the control networks, which allow to set-up, manage, close and record the characteristics of connections or communication sessions; such control networks are often, for availability and security reasons physically separate from the transport networks, and execute control functions in a connection based or connection less way (SS7 and its equivalent for ATM networks in the first case, TCP in the second case, and SCTP as an intermediate solution ) 1. However, because obviously a control network is required to run and get revenue from a transport network, the ownership of the two was traditionally the same, and thus the suppliers were traditionally supplying integrated transport and control networks with management thereof.Operators could embed via application-specific programming of the upper SS7 stack layers (MTP-3), so called “intelligent network” or “computational intelligence “ functionality, such as call admission control, mobile agents, etc...(see e.g. [2]). From the business process management point of view, the interest is not on the transport networks, but on the capabilities offered by the signalling/control networks. Admittedly, SS7, SCTP management exclusively by the operators gave them too much power in process management. 1 The Stream Control Transmission protocol SCTP allows companies to exchange signalling information between switching systems using IP 3.2. Open signalling and adaptive networks From a technical and research perspective, things have changed with standards such as the IEEE P1520 standards [3] for interfaces to communication networks, as well as so called adaptive networks. Both define interfaces such that a user, e.g. the economic agent initiating a transaction, can determine the controls applicable to his own communication needs (connection, session, flow), and choose between transport networks or their dynamic configurations From the business process management point of view, it should be possible to extend the IEEE P1520 programmable interfaces to networks, with corresponding programming model and binding mechanisms, to business logics and not just tariffs or quality of service. 3.3. Other technical capabilities 1)Active networks: The approach described above is especially appropriate for services implemented statically, usually of transactional nature, based on servers. Active networks cater to cases when the packet processing is distributed and performed by the routers along the path (or tree) to a destination.. From the point of view of business process management, active networks enable the capability to identify, select and manage a set of economic agents involved in some of these processes, and to manage their links. 2)Hot billing and pre-paid services: Whereas traditionally subscription based fixed or mobile voice and data services rely on the delayed payment to the operator, via payment intermediaries, of the subscription, plus traffic (or bundles thereof), the need to check the outstanding balance prior and during a call against the credit balance of a pre-paid non-subscription customer, have shifted the ultimate solvency testing of the end user away from the payment intermediary over to the mobile operator and it’s associated rating systems. Communications equipment providers have thus engineered interface and control systems which link directly the control network (which establishes the connection or session) with the customer care system (which checks on prepaid balances), all this in real time. What this means, is that from being traditionally trusted with the collection, aggregation, and solvency checks of the end user, the payment intermediary has only the collection task left. This turns the mobile operators into de facto deposit banks. As to the end user authentification, it is still split and essentially done twice in different ways, because of different processes for authentification on the communications service provisioning side of the operator (typically AAA servers), and for the payee authentification of the payment intermediary (typically a financial collection system with account identification and authentification). From the point of view of business process management, hot billing illustrates alltogether the ability of non-payment agents to take on financial deposits management, and even to extend this to other services, while managing the communication networks at the same time. Pre-paid services also illustrate the ability in mobile networks to activate and monito	aaa (video game industry);atm turbo;access network;active networking;authentication;beam propagation method;black box;business logic;business process;cell signaling;computational intelligence;computer;control function (econometrics);control system;electronic billing;electronic switching system;emoticon;entity;ibm basic programming support;intelligent network;interaction;internet backbone;logic gate;mobile agent;modeling language;name binding;network packet;network planning and design;outsourcing;partial template specialization;pathfinding;plug and play;process modeling;programming model;provisioning;quality of service;router (computing);routing;rule 110;runtime system;semantic network;signalling system no. 7;stumbleupon;swift (programming language);telecommunications network	Louis-François Pau;Peter H.

Existing video streaming algorithms can perform poorly in such network conditions because of their reactive adaptation approach. Recent efforts suggest that bitrate adaptation using proactive accurate bandwidth prediction can help improve the quality of experience (QoE) of video streaming. However, highly accurate long-term predictions may be needed in mobile environments and those can be difficult to obtain. In this work, we examine the impact of bandwidth prediction quality on the QoE. We first characterize bandwidth profiles where bandwidth prediction-based adaptation can be useful. We then study the impact of prediction horizon and errors on the performance of Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) streaming. We observe that performance improves as the prediction horizon increases at first and then benefits start to diminish. We demonstrate that with proper error mitigation heuristic, even erroneous predictions can be useful in some scenarios. Finally, we study the role of video system parameters, namely buffer size and bitrate granularity on bandwidth prediction-based adaptation.	content adaptation;heuristic;ibm notes;streaming algorithm;streaming media	Tarun Mangla;Nawanol Theera-Ampornpunt;Mostafa H.

Such systems have not been able to allocate channels dynamically to adapt to environments where the popularity distribution of videos changes, because of the essential inflexibility of existing broadcasting protocols. We address dynamic channel allocation for video broadcasting services, and propose a channel management technique that can adapt well to the dynamic environment, using a flexible broadcasting scheme presented in our previous work (2005). Our channel management scheme decides how many channels should be allocated to each video to maximize the system throughput, based on the video's popularity and reneging probability. The proposed scheme has been verified using extensive simulation.	server (computing);simulation;throughput;unicast;versant object database	Jin B. Kwon;Jeong B.

In order to provide VoIP (Voice over IP) and real-time streaming applications for stations, handoff mechanism must be provided for reducing latency and seamless communication. However, the IEEE802.11 standards handoff is not appropriate to supply their QoS, because it is based on a full-scanning approach. Full-scanning spends too much time searching Access Point (AP). Therefore, the various pre-scan handoff protocols such as Sync Scan and Deuce Scan have been proposed. They perform scanning to find nearby APs before station is out of contact with AP, but they have much overhead for pre-scanning. Our handoff mechanism reduces the delay and overhead associated with link layer handoff by periodically scanning the channel groups. We prove that our per-scanning mechanism supports a faster handoff and has a lower overhead compared to the conventional schemes.	ct scan;interrupt latency;network packet;overhead (computing);quality of service;rss;real-time clock;real-time transcription;seamless3d;simulation	Mahnsuk Yoon;Keuchul Cho;Jilong Li;Jeongbae Yun;Minyoung Yoo;Youngil Kim;Qin Shu;Jangkyu Yun;Ki Jun Han	2011	2011 Eighth International Conference on Information Technology: New Generations	10.1109/ITNG.2011.26	real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Embedded	-10.55991257619228	89.88861966894254	124215
5a578050a66f7c9d7b4c98defd68cbea393e7845	vertical handover over intermediate switching framework: assuring service quality for mobile users	vertical handover;qos;bandwidth reservation;isn	Ensuring quality of service (QoS) for the mobile users during vertical handover between IEEE 802.11 wireless local area networks (WLAN) and data network provided by Ultramodern Telecommunication Systems (UMTS) is one of the key requirements for seamless mobility and transfer of existing connections from one network to another. QoS fulfillment is a complex problem and requires participation of both the mobile users as well as the connection networks. The QoS assurance criteria for existing connections can be affected by fluctuations of data rates when a user moves from the high speed WLAN network to the low speed UMTS network, even in the presence of another WLAN network in its vicinity. This can happen if the alternate WLAN network is highly loaded. Therefore handover from a high speed network to a low speed network should be avoided, whenever possible. This paper proposes a QoS based handover procedure that prioritizes the existing connection over the new connections so that rate fluctuations due to handover can be avoided if there exist another WLAN network in the range of the mobile user. Whenever the possibility of handover is detected, a pre-handover bandwidth reservation technique is used to reserve bandwidth at the alternate WLAN networks to avoid QoS degradation. The proposed scheme is implemented in Qualnet network simulator and the performance is analyzed and compared with traditional handover techniques.	attachments;bandwidth management;elegant degradation;existential quantification;quality of service;requirement;seamless3d;simulation;spatial variability	Aditya Yadav;Maushumi Barooah;Sandip Chakraborty;Sukumar Nandi	2014	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-013-1518-9	real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;soft handover;computer network	Mobile	-10.186753999668415	90.57348082607407	124259

However, the proposed architecture and implementation are applicable to other spectrum bands as well. We also present a dynamic spectrum sensing methodology for primary incumbent detection. The proposed method is based on observing the PHY errors, received signal strength and statistical model building. For coordination among radio nodes, synchronization and fast channel switching, we present new communication protocols, design extended management frame structure and modify the hardware abstraction layer.

It's a new approach based on the analysis of data stored in call detail records (CDR), which are tickets that contain data describing information related to the system elements involved, such as time and duration of the call, phone types and numbers, SS7 signaling, etc. The tickets are generated in PSTN switches or over VoIP gateways, for the case of Internet protocol detail record (IPDRs). Their main function is to furnish information for the billing system of telephone companies. Because of this characteristic one can consider the CDR highly reliable, otherwise the phone companies would risk performing serious mistakes in the billing of costumers. These characteristics can be used to detect faults focusing in different aspects related to the call, such as technical, economic, or social. Our main goal is to analyze and classify these algorithms according to their performance and use.	algorithm;electronic billing;elegant degradation;entry point;network switch;signalling system no. 7	Gean Davis Breda;Leonardo de Souza Mendes	2006	IEEE Globecom 2006	10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.461	quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;fault detection and isolation;computer network	Embedded	-19.628536255971053	92.22446193265974	125604

We started comparing the operator-requested traffic profile against the real behavior of commonly used software-based traffic generators. We aim at performing tests under different conditions and looking both at packet/bit rate and inter-packet time distribution.

They partly compensate this traffic increase by improved transmission technology and network densification. Supporting videos at high quality during peak traffic, however, does not scale economically. Instead, means are required for the operator to adapt the bitrate of the videos to the current network situation. Scalable Video Coding (SVC) provides a convenient way to adapt the bitrates of video streams in the network by dropping bit stream layers. From resource utilization point of view, the limitation of SVC is that the layer structure does not allow an operator to compare the importance of two layers of different videos with respect to their contribution to the user-perceived video quality. In existing solutions, the limitation is resolved by implementing sophisticated optimization algorithms at network bottlenecks for optimal rate adaptation among multiple videos.  We take a different approach to eliminate the overhead of signaling and implementations introduced by the optimizations at bottlenecks while targeting at the same optimization goal. We propose a QoE-aware priority marking algorithm for SVC-based video streaming. In our approach, SVC layers are mapped to a finite number of priorities which are marked in video packets to be transmitted with video streams. This mapping takes into account the data rate and the quality contribution of a layer among layers of a group of videos. At network bottlenecks, rate adaptation simply follows the pre-determined priorities without further optimization needed. Our results show that the QoE-aware priority marking algorithm indeed overcomes the limitations of existing SVC packet marking and has the potential to achieve a QoE-optimal resource utilization in wireless access networks.	access network;algorithm;bitstream;bottleneck (software);data rate units;display resolution;dots per inch;ip traceback;item unique identification;mathematical optimization;network packet;out-of-band agreement;overhead (computing);point of view (computer hardware company);scalability;scalable video coding;streaming media;uncompressed video;weatherstar	Bo Fu;Dirk Staehle;Gerald Kunzmann;Eckehard G.

The desperately poor are not the only ones affected:  Relatively affluent users may be in locations that are too geographically remote (and too sparsely populated) to justify the deployment of wired infrastructure or even cellular telephone service.  Locales that normally enjoy high-speed network service may lose access in the event of a natural or political disaster that disables infrastructure just when it is most needed. Communication satellites are an obvious solution: no location is so remote or depopulated that satellites may never appear overhead, and satellite operations are unaffected by earthquakes and hurricanes. However, the digital communication services offered by communication satellite operators to date have been too expensive for some purposes and too limited in bandwidth for others. These limitations are a natural consequence of communication satellite and constellation design:  A satellite in geosynchronous orbit is stationary in the sky; as such it can easily sustain continuous wireless Internet connections among points on Earth’s surface that are within its field of view. However, launching a satellite into geosynchronous orbit is very expensive. Multiple satellites are required for complete coverage of Earth’s inhabited surface, and each such satellite is a single point of failure.  Satellites can be launched into low-Earth orbit (LEO) at far less cost. But because they are in continuous motion relative to Earth’s surface they can only sustain continuous Internet connections if they are cross-linked, so that connections can be handed off from one satellite to the next. This additional capacity and complexity makes LEO satellites expensive as well, and many more of them are needed in order to provide complete coverage of the service area. Note that the key constraint on these designs is the requirement to sustain continuous Internet connections: the Internet architecture is built on the expectation that effective network communication is possible only when there is a continuous endto-end connection from data source to data destination. Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) challenges that expectation, supporting end-to-end data exchange between network nodes Permission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage, and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

Universal, perpetually available DTN network service could therefore be provided by a constellation of simple, inexpensive LEO satellites – potentially nanosatellites, perhaps no larger than CubeSats – that communicate only with network nodes that are currently in their immediate field of view. We explore this architecture, suggesting that the cost of such a service would be low enough to bring routine network access within the reach of the most economically disadvantaged, while additionally sustaining ongoing remote science investigations and standing ready to support relief efforts in emergencies.	access network;communications satellite;data recovery;delay-tolerant networking;end-to-end principle;geosynchronous orbit;internet;leo (computer);mobile phone;overhead (computing);population;reliability engineering;single point of failure;software deployment;stationary process	Scott Burleigh	2013		10.1145/2502880.2502896	local area network;global network;telecommunications;computer science;cost–benefit analysis;delay-tolerant networking;communications satellite;cost estimate;computer network	Networks	-18.82809667015881	95.18728273187037	126023

The process of delivering video to these receivers appropriate to their available bandwidth is called heterogeneous multicast. We present a solution for this problem based on the combination of multiple description coding and network coding. The receivers feed back information on the number of linearly independent descriptions that they obtain, and this is used to optimize the rate allocation of multiple descriptions. Our simulations show significant improvement in performance compared to unirate multicast that uses network coding. Unlike the case for unirate multicast, users with higher bandwidth receive higher quality video with MD/PNC.	lossy compression;molecular dynamics;multicast	Adarsh K. Ramasubramonian;John W.

In this paper, we propose a novel concepts and mechanisms that enable the use of Scalable Video Coding (SVC) in Peer–to–Peer Television (P2PTV) system to achieve the quality adaptation. Using SVC, we have developed a two-stage quality adaptation algorithm that matches the video quality with available local and system resources. Key components with different our design options are presented and experimentally evaluated, with the objective of investigating benefits of network P2P in combination with SVC. We have carried out extensive experiments on real stream data to (i) evaluate the performance of our design in terms of adapted video stream SVC with available resources (ii) more robustness against high churn rates, heterogeneous peers, and flash crowd scenarios. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the approach and bring us one step closer to real adaptive peer-to-peer streaming.	algorithm;experiment;iptv;journal of multimedia;next-generation network;peer-to-peer assisted streaming solution;scalability;scalable video coding;simulation;slashdot effect;streaming media	Youssef Lahbabi;Ahmed Hammouch;El Hassane Ibn Elhaj	2014	JMPT		real-time computing;simulation;computer science;multimedia	DB	-8.937323011956417	98.71996366738242	126463

In this demo, we show how the recently proposed ProgMP programming model for Multipath TCP scheduling enables application- and preference-aware Multipath TCP scheduling within the Multipath TCP Linux Kernel. We use ProgMP to systematically derive the specification of a novel scheduler which retains an application-specific acceptable round-trip time and subflow preferences. This scheduler only utilises non-preferred (e.g., metered cellular) subflows if all preferred subflows (e.g., WiFi) do not retain the acceptable upper round-trip time. We further evaluate this novel scheduler by executing the scheduler specification within the ProgMP runtime in the Multipath TCP Linux Kernel.	game demo;internet protocol suite;linux;multipath propagation;programming model;scheduling (computing)	Alexander Frömmgen;Boris Koldehofe	2017		10.1145/3155016.3155017	multipath propagation;specification language;real-time computing;the internet;multipath tcp;scheduling (computing);programming paradigm;linux kernel;computer science	Networks	-7.186033365358259	91.40150402041583	126604

f9dc99aef9be774c9b3f71ec9e0b4361d97c91aa	multipath transport for virtual private networks		An important class of virtual private networks (VPNs) builds secure tunnels at the transport layer leveraging TCP or UDP. Multipath TCP (MPTCP), an ongoing IETF effort that has been adopted into Linux and iOS, extends TCP to allow data to be delivered over multiple network interfaces and paths simultaneously. In this paper, using a testbed that can emulate a range of path characteristics between the VPN end points, we first empirically quantify the potential of using MPTCP tunnels to increase the goodput of VPN communications when multiple data paths are available. We further design and implement a preliminary version of Multipath UDP (MPUDP) to address the adverse effect of the duplicated congestion control actions that is known with a TCP-in-TCP tunnel. We observe that a severe asymmetry of path delays may cause an excessive amount of packet reordering at the receiving end and consequently degrade the overall performance of TCP-in-MPUDP tunnels. Moreover, we find that a packet scheduler capable of tracking path delays and allocating more packets to path(s) with shorter delay(s) to be an effective and relatively lightweight solution for MPUDP, instead of an elaborate data sequencing mechanism like the one used by MPTCP.	goodput;internet protocol suite;linux;multipath propagation;network congestion;network packet;network scheduler;propagation delay;scheduling (computing);software propagation;testbed;transport layer security;virtual private network;ios	Daniel Lukaszewski;Geoffrey Xie	2017			the internet;computer science;kernel (statistics);private network;multipath propagation;computer security;computer network;data processing	Networks	-5.3043379402812825	91.74589760542123	126640

We propose to use rateless codes, or Fountain codes, such that each server acts as an independent source, without the need to coordinate its sending strategy with other servers. In this case, the problem of maximizing the received video quality and minimizing the bandwidth usage, is simply reduced to a rate allocation problem. We provide an optimal solution for an ideal scenario where the loss probability on each server-client path is exactly known.

The architecture for mapping QoS requirements makes use of inherent MAC layer convergence flexibilities available in these networks along with features of MAC layer bridging as specified by IEEE 802.1d and IEEE 802.1p. Elaborate simulations are performed on NS-2 platform to verify the efficacy of such an approach. The contribution of this work is especially significant because of its low complexity of implementation due to use of existing standards which makes it commercially feasible. The work also outlines the contribution in the perspective of addressing issues of last mile broadband connectivity to rural and sparsely connected regions of the developing world, especially India like demographic.	access network;backhaul (telecommunications);bridging (networking);interference (communication);interoperability;multicast;network packet;overhead (computing);quality of service;relay;requirement;seamless3d;simulation;software deployment;telecommunications link	Ritesh Kumar Kalle;Vidya Sagar;Sumit Kumar;Abhijit M.

Mobile IPv6 enables mobile users to communicate with each other while moving. In this study, a mobile IPv6 network was implemented by the IEEE 802.11 specification, and its performance was analyzed using TCP and UDP applications. The experimental results indicate that throughput stabilized for UDP applications after about 6–14 seconds. However, TCP applications were found to stabilize throughput in 10–20 seconds. The evaluation results reveal that TCP applications perform less well in mobile IPv6 networking than UDP applications. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

4b9c9b2388b4be54ec8929cccc98c08362c3bf19	paradigms for real-time video communication and for video distribution	engineering and technology;teknik och teknologier	The use of new information technologies has drastically changed the way that we lead our lives. Communication technologies in particular have had a great impact on our day-to-day behavior. For example, it is now common to hear the voice and see the face of our loved-ones on another continents, or work with colleagues across the globe on a daily basis. With this change in behavior and the fast adoption of emerging technologies, new challenges in the telecommunications area are arising. This thesis is concerned with two such challenges: real-time video communication and video distribution. The latency constraint in real-time video communication is in essence incompatible with the uncertainty of best-effort networks, such as the Internet. The recent arrival of smart-phones has added another requirement to the application, in terms of the limited computational and battery power. The research community has invested a large amount of effort in developing techniques that allow a mobile sender to outsource video encoding complexity to an unconstrained receiver by means of a feedback channel. We question that approach with respect to real-time applications, arguing that long round-trip-times may render any feedback unusable at best, and costly in practice. We investigate the effect of channel round-trip-times on the popular distributed video coding setup, as well as on the traditional hybrid video coding architecture. Using a simple analytical framework, we propose the use of systems that adapt to the video content and the network in realtime. Our results show that substantial improvements in video quality can be achieved when the feedback channel is used correctly. The use of mobile devices has also a significant impact on the application of video distribution. In general, the multitude of devices that can be used to download and view video places new requirements on video distribution systems. The system must not only be able to scale to a large number of receivers in a bandwidth efficient manner, it must also support a wide range of network capacities and display capabilities. We address this problem by optimizing the set of rates that is used to provide video to receivers with heterogeneous requirements. Our approach is based on a favorable interpretation of the underlying mathematical problem, allowing the use of well-known quantization theoretic concepts. The resulting solution provides the possibility to design video distribution systems that adapt to changes in receiver characteristics online, with minimal delay.	best-effort delivery;computation;data compression;digital distribution;digital video;download;internet;mobile device;outsourcing;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time locating system;real-time transcription;requirement;smart tv;smartphone;theory;usability	Ermin Kozica	2011			simulation;computer science;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	Mobile	-8.711459766493437	102.19405554382901	127208

The lack of work and visibility in the domain often arouse users' negative feelings about simulation. In this article, we propose a framework dedicated to the validation, the comprehension and the analysis of MANET simulators. The system can process trace files generated by different versions of a simulator or different simulators. The solution is based on software instrumentation and the use of a standard trace format. It proposes three types of analysis: the representation of the network activity with timelines, the plotting of network metrics and the validation against the 802.11 standard specifications.	flight simulator;formal specification;hoc (programming language);jung;java;network packet;scalable vector graphics;simulation;timeline;xml	Ryad Ben-El-Kezadri;Farouk Kamoun	2007	2007 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2007.4394154	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;instrumentation;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;delay-tolerant networking;distributed computing;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	Arch	-10.712003475914683	91.48399077077491	128078

To provide quality of service guarantees, certain mechanisms need to be implemented which support predictable packet handling, bandwidth allocation, and call admission control. In order to configure these mechanisms, a solid understanding of VoIP traffic characteristics and its respective bandwidth requirements is necessary. In this paper, we characterize traffic traces generated by various VoIP applications. According to the H.323 standard, the characteristics are described by means of token bucket parameters, which are then used to derive the required service rates for individual traffic flows. While in most cases sources send out fairly steady packet streams, there are situations where software based clients emit rather bursty traffic resulting in unreasonably high bandwidth needs. On basis of these traffic flows, we investigate the effects that token bucket parameters have on the bandwidth demand and discuss tradeoff possibilities in order to reduce it.	requirement	Sanaa Sharafeddine;Anton Riedl;Josef Glasmann;Jürgen Totzke	2003		10.1109/ISCC.2003.1214297	traffic generation model;bandwidth throttling;traffic policing;network traffic control;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;voice over ip;traffic shaping;computer security;internet traffic engineering;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network	Networks	-5.678310383475262	95.55571053993002	128222

The first unfairness problem arises due to the uniformity of the MAC layer protocol at the access point (AP) and user nodes that result in equal share to the AP and the user nodes but not to the individual flows. The second unfairness problem arises due to the inability of the physical layer to distinguish frame errors due to hidden terminal based collisions and frame errors due to poor signal strength. We present FairMAC, a deployable solution that addresses these unfairness problems without requiring a change to the 802.11 protocol. Thus, our solution is immediately deployable in the millions of currently operational hotspots. We evaluate the performance of our protocol using simulations and a prototype implementation. We show that FairMAC provides fair access to all the flows regardless whether they are originating at the AP or a host.	bandwidth (signal processing);circuit complexity;downstream (software development);hotspot (wi-fi);interference (communication);noise (signal processing);prototype;simulation;testbed;throughput;wireless access point	Prasun Sinha;Yuval Shavitt;Ramachandran Ramjee;Danny Raz;Sneha Kumar Kasera	2005	Proceedings. 14th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks, 2005.

3b891927beb2739d70f3c04fc0f0a5281ca51d97	networking support for physical-layer cross-technology communication		Recent research on physical layer cross technology communication (PHY-CTC) brings a timely answer for escalated wireless coexistence and open spectrum movement. PHY-CTC achieves direct communication among heterogeneous wireless technologies (e.g.,WiFi, Bluetooth, and ZigBee) in physical layer and thus brings communication support for coexistence service such as spectrum management and IoT device control. To put PHY-CTC into service, however, there still exists a gap due to its transmission failure and asymmetric link (i.e., one-way PHYCTC) issues. In this paper, we propose NetCTC – the first networking support design for PHY-CTC to establish feedbacks (e.g., ACKs) and thus meet the upper layer networking requirements in heterogeneous unicast, multicast and broadcast. The core design of NetCTC is a real-time interaction mechanism which achieves reliable, transmission efficient and parallel interactive communication among heterogeneous devices. We implement and evaluate NetCTC on commodity devices (Laptops with Atheros AR2425 WiFi NIC, smart phones with Broadcom BCM4330 WiFi chip and MicaZ CC2420) and the USRP-N210 platform. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that NetCTC achieves reliable bidirectional cross technology communication under a full range of wireless configurations including stationary, mobile and dutycycled settings.	bluetooth;coexist (image);laptop;multicast;network interface controller;one-way function;phy (chip);real-time clock;requirement;smartphone;stationary process;unicast;universal software radio peripheral	Shuai Wang;Zhimeng Yin;Zhijun Li;Tian He	2018	2018 IEEE 26th International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP)	10.1109/ICNP.2018.00042	computer network;spectrum management;multicast;wireless;physical layer;computer science;open spectrum;bluetooth;unicast;broadcasting	Mobile	-11.40229701250638	94.70225347590005	128320

IEEE 802.11 access points double as routers making the network architecture completely transparent to mobile clients, who view the network as a conventional wireless LAN. Layer-2 handoffs between access points trigger routing activities inside the network, which can be thought of as layer-3 handoffs. We describe the design rationale and a testbed implementation of iMesh. We present results related to the handoff performance. The results demonstrate excellent handoff performance, the overall latency varying between 50-100 ms, depending on different layer-2 techniques, even when a five-hop long route update is needed. Various performance measurements also demonstrate the clear superiority of a flat routing scheme relative to a more traditional, Mobile IP-like scheme to handle layer-3 handoff.	client-side;design rationale;interrupt latency;mesh networking;mobile ip;network architecture;router (computing);routing;testbed;wireless access point;wireless mesh network	Vishnu Navda;Anand Kashyap;Samir Ranjan Das	2005	Sixth IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless Mobile and Multimedia Networks	10.1109/WOWMOM.2005.35	wireless mesh network;telecommunications;computer science;mesh networking;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	-11.159963378026513	89.7687131618484	128403

In this contribution, a class of service interactions are addressed that result from deficiencies of the IN infrastructure to provide to a service the necessary information to carry out its task properly. A number of requirements are established that remove or at least reduce these deficiencies, and a proposal is made how these requirements could be realized. In this proposal, the concept of Service Admission Control (SAC) is introduced, which is based on a session concept represented by a dynamic Session Configuration Profile (SessCoP) accessible and modifiable by IN services that may influence a call relationship (session). This SessCoP allows the IN services to gather the information needed to carry out their tasks properly, that are not provided by the messages of the signalling protocols. The application of these concepts are explained by two brief case studies. This contribution reports on work in progress.		Dirk O.

This study shows the advantage of deploying smart routers assuming efficient contract and usage, and quantifies the extra benefit they can generate. Interestingly, we find smart routing technology can also potentially help ISPs in today’s sluggish service market: smart router users tend to contract more capacities and ISPs can raise their service prices without losing customers.	border gateway protocol;decision problem;differentiated services;integrated services;management science;marginal model;nichols plot;operations research;per-hop behaviour;quality of service;resource reservation protocol;router (computing);routing;smart tv;smart card;software deployment	Rui Dai;Dale O.

However, such techniques have to be carefully adapted to the application state dynamics and the underlying network. This work presents a novel framework that minimizes inconsistency by optimizing bandwidth usage to deliver useful information.

Further, we adopt the bandwidth broker (BB) for resource allocations and COPS-SLS protocol for negotiating QoS in DiffServ backbone, and the context transfer protocol (CTP) on IntServ wireless networks to resolve service interruptions during handoffs. Finally, we propose a flexible and efficient bandwidth adjustment algorithm, which is based on CBQ and RED schemes, to adaptively reallocate available bandwidth among different traffic classes on border gateway routers between DiffServ and IntServ networks.	algorithm;bundle adjustment;class-based queueing;differentiated services;end-to-end principle;integrated services;internet backbone;network architecture;priority queue;quality of service;requirement;serial experiments lain;signaling protocol;standard sea level;user requirements document	Ing-Chau Chang;Shi-Feng Chen	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-77090-9_33	real-time computing;network architecture;quality of service;computer science;user requirements document;wireless network;distributed computing;integrated services;computer network	Mobile	-10.96532288940872	92.7696251908205	129227

However, because the current Internet architecture cannot provide sufficient QoS for such kind of real-time applications, the performances of them are often poor under congested or interfered Internet environment. When Internet traffics are congested or interfered, the frame loss and delay jitter of video streaming are severe. In this paper, we design and implement a smart traffic prediction and flow control mechanism on an industrial video streaming product to improve the above problems. Here, we adopt the principle of Kalman filter to design the mechanism. From the practical tests and evaluations, the proposed mechanism can indeed improve the transmission performance of video streaming and make the streaming playing more smoothly on receivers.	closed-circuit television;flow control (data);internet;kalman filter;packet delay variation;performance;real-time clock;real-time operating system;real-time transcription;smoothing;streaming media	Yue-Ru Chuang;Chia-Sheng Hsu;Je-Wei Chen	2010	2010 Sixth International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing	10.1109/IIHMSP.2010.67	kalman filter;real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Robotics	-6.219541714861958	97.58925275723	129306

The proposed approach is fundamentally different from conventional authentication methods and offers robust authentication for multimedia data in the presence of channel noise. The scheme is designed in such a way that it facilitates explicit capture and exploitation of channel condition as well as how the multimedia content is packetized and transmitted. The design allows the integration of authentication with the framework of joint source and channel coding (JSCC) to achieve adaptiveness to the content and efficient utilization of limited bandwidth. We have realized the proposed scheme through optimal resource allocation and authentication graph construction.

In this paper, we propose Content Name-based Real-time Streaming (NRTS) to enhance the basic concept and implementation of CCN in order to improve streaming quality. NRTS utilizes “symbolic interest,” which eliminates segment identification, and “content-name-based streaming,” which enables per-content (instead of per-packet) streaming and multicasting using a rate control scheme based on network conditions. NRTS is more suitable for high-performance delay-sensitive real-time applications than the original CCN architecture. It avoids the generation of bursty interests and the need for complex operations such as setting the pipeline size. The results from the experiments conducted using simulations and testbeds show that NRTS attains higher throughput and scalability than the original CCN architecture.	algorithm;cyclomatic complexity;experiment;icn gps;multicast;network congestion;network packet;pipeline (computing);real-time clock;real-time transcription;router (computing);scalability;simulation;testbed;throughput	Kazuhisa Matsuzono;Hitoshi Asaeda	2016	2016 13th IEEE Annual Consumer Communications & Networking Conference (CCNC)	10.1109/CCNC.2016.7444837	real-time computing;the internet;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Embedded	-6.5796068597659465	97.80669354757832	129424

A protocol converter box made the ASCII terminal appear to the host as a 3270 display and made the host appear to understand the escape sequences necessary to control the ASCII terminal. The author describes an approach to connecting 'smart' asynchronous ASCII devices to 370 hosts. By having a single screen at the microcomputer instead of two (one at the controller and one at the display) and by utilizing compression and asynchronous data links, the performance of remote workstations on slow links can be greatly improved. >		Robert S.

The proposed system builds on scalable video coding (SVC) to provide some degrees of adaptation to the users watching the video without the support of a costly high-performance low-latency video transcoding server. At the same time, the DASH standard is used to leverage the scalable video for providing HTTP streaming adaptation to users watching the video. The performance of several chunk uploading strategies are investigated by simulations, evaluating the tradeoff between several parameters such as video quality, buffering rate, idle time, and the startup delay of the clients. Finally, experimental results on a testbed confirm the simulation results.	data compression;hypertext transfer protocol;mobile device;norm (social);push technology;real-time clock;real-time transcription;scalability;scalable video coding;server (computing);simulation;testbed;upload;web server	Matti Siekkinen;Alberto Barraja;Jukka K.

This is happening despite the notorious difficulties of transmitting data packets with a deadline over the Internet, due to variability in throughput, delays and losses. These problems arise significantly when using wireless networks where the available bandwidth is low and the losses are important due to its error prone transmission nature. In this paper we propose a fast-forwarding technique that is based on segmenting the movie on different files. Normal movie reproduction requires all the files, but fast-forwarding reproduction only requires one file. Those files can me merged by the client or by the server. The segmentation is frame based, grouping all the frames that can be independently decoded together. The resulting file can be showed with any existing player. This group of frames would be the ones to use in a fast-forward reproduction. Our techniques can also be useful in adaptive environments, like wireless networks, because there is no problem for the fast-forward file to use the same optimizations that exist for full movie files. This method also reduces the storage bandwidth and the storage size needed (there is no extra data for fast-forwarding). We also propose a video server architecture that takes advantage of this technique to achieve full interactive video reproduction. The evaluation results shown in this paper demonstrates that our technique enhances video fast-forwarding operations.

We present here an objective evaluation of eight most popular games encoded using H.264/MPEG-AVC, H.265/MPEG-HEVC and VP9 encoders for live game video streaming applications as currently used by Twitch.tv and YouTube-Gaming. The results are reported in terms of three objective video quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM, VIFp), Bjontegaard-Delta Bitrate (BD-BR) analysis, and encoding duration. For the encoding settings and the encoders used, in terms of BD-BR analysis, H.265/MPEG-HEVC is found to provide the best compression efficiency but is 2.6 times slower than H.264/MPEG-AVC. The magnitude of bitrate savings for VP9 compared to H.264/MPEG-AVC is found to be highly dependent on the content type, with H.264/MPEG-AVC resulting in higher average bitrate savings with an encoding speed four times faster than VP9.	approximation;blu-ray;codec;daily active users;encoder;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;high efficiency video coding;peak signal-to-noise ratio;streaming media;structural similarity;vp9	Nabajeet Barman;Maria G.

In this paper we consider the transmission of stored video from a server to a client across a network, and explore how the client buffer space can be used most effectively toward reducing the variability of the transmitted bit rate. Two basic results are presented. First, we show how to achieve the greatest possible reduction in rate variability when sending stored video to a client with given buffer size. We formally establish the optimality of our approach and illustrate its performance over a set of long MPEG-1 encoded video traces. Second, we evaluate the impact of optimal smoothing on the network resources needed for video transport, under two network service models: deterministic guaranteed service (Chang 1994; Wrege et al. 1996) and renegotiated constant-bit-rate (RCBR) service (Grossglauser et al. 1997). Under both models, the impact of optimal smoothing is dramatic.	end-to-end encryption;requirement;smoothing;spatial variability	James D. Salehi;Zhi-Li Zhang;James F. Kurose;Donald F.

In these applications, a multi-resolution representation is typically desired for streaming large 3D meshes, allowing for incremental rendering at the viewers while data is still being transmitted. Such progressive coding, however, introduces dependencies between data. This paper quantitatively analyzes the effects of such dependency on the intermediate decoded mesh quality when the progressive mesh is transmitted over a lossy network, by modeling the distribution of decoding time as a function of mesh properties and network parameters. To illustrate the usefulness of our analytical model, we describe three of its applications. First, we show how it can be used to analytically compute the expected decoded mesh quality. Second, we study two extreme cases of dependency in progressive mesh and show that the effect of dependencies on decoded mesh quality diminishes with time. Finally, based on the model, we propose a packetization strategy that improves the decoded mesh quality during the initial stage of streaming.	3d computer graphics;incremental rendering;lossy compression;polygon mesh;progressive meshes;virtual world	Wei Cheng;Wei Tsang Ooi;Sebastien Mondet;Romulus Grigoras;Géraldine Morin	2007		10.1145/1291233.1291399	switched mesh;simulation;data type;computer science;theoretical computer science;triangle mesh;shared mesh;order one network protocol;multimedia;t-vertices	Visualization	-9.923437595735953	104.82973115532523	130333

Vendor-specific technologies, such as Profinet IRT, have demonstrated Ethernet networks with hard real-time (RT) properties. Specified by the IEEE, the Audio and Video Bridging (AVB) technology promises a standardized approach to RT Ethernet. However, AVB has been conceived for other application fields, e.g. home entertainment systems. Several aspects necessary for AVB's potential use in industrial automation solutions are not covered by the standard. One important aspect is the usage of redundant communication paths to increase fault tolerance. In this paper, a method of achieving redundancy with AVB is proposed. It has been verified through simulation and has been proposed to the AVB Task Group for use in future revisions of the standard.	application-specific integrated circuit;authorization;automation;bridging (networking);fault tolerance;field-programmable gate array;ieee 1471;item response theory;microsoft outlook for mac;network switch;network topology;professional audio;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;requirement;simulation;software factory;spanning tree protocol	Oliver Kleineberg;Peter Fröhlich;Donal Heffernan	2011	ETFA2011	10.1109/ETFA.2011.6058994	local area network;embedded system;fault tolerance;real-time computing;synchronous ethernet;ethernet flow control;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;ata over ethernet;electrical engineering;artificial intelligence;operating system;automation;industrial ethernet;carrier ethernet;computer network	EDA	-21.202886319123557	92.38582327079965	130345

Comparing two correct experiment runs in these conditions is a domain that has not been completely explored yet. We propose a method to construct a first-order Markov model to capture and subsequently compare two runs of an experiment. Our model is based on transitions between different network events, and to create this first-order Markov model, we find all states from observed data and compute transition probabilities amongst them. Consequently, the model is saved in a repository. To compare two runs, we find the Euclidean Distance between this saved model and the observed model. We illustrate this concept on the DETER testbed by comparing different variations of the Kaminsky DNS cache poisoning attack experiment. Our observations show that comparison between similar experiments have negligible euclidean distances as compared to those between different experiment variations. Thus, we demonstrate that this methodology is promising and provides a principled approach for comparing two experiment runs.	computer security;dns spoofing;euclidean distance;experiment;first-order predicate;markov chain;markov model;testbed	Swati Sharma;Alefiya Hussain	2012	2012 Fourth International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks (COMSNETS 2012)	10.1109/COMSNETS.2012.6151363	markov chain;maximum-entropy markov model;markov kernel;simulation;markov property;computer science;continuous-time markov chain;theoretical computer science;network security;machine learning;causal markov condition;hidden semi-markov model;probability;first-order logic;euclidean distance;markov algorithm;markov process;markov chain mixing time;markov model;computer security;hidden markov model;statistics;variable-order markov model	SE	-4.869063567843239	106.18649217776895	130464

We manage queueing at the access link to: (1) improve the response time of interactive network applications; (2) reduce congestion-related packet losses; while (3) maintaining high throughput for bulk-transfer applications. Our policy controls queue length by manipulating receive socket buffer sizes. We have implemented this solution in a dynamically loadable Linux kernel module, and tested it over low bandwidth links. Our approach yields a 7-fold improvement in packet latency over an unmodified system while maintaining 94% link utilization. In the common case, congestionrelated packet losses at the access link can be eliminated. Finally, by prioritizing short flows, we show that our system reduces the time to download a complex web page during a large background transfer by a factor of two.	call stack;control system;download;linux;loadable kernel module;network congestion;network packet;response time (technology);throughput;web page	Neil Spring;Maureen Chesire;Mark Berryman;Vivek Sahasranaman;Thomas E.

To alleviate this limitation, especially in the transport layer, the error control schemes based on FEC (forward error correction), ARQ (automatic repeat request), interleaving, and their hybrid are essential. However, each error control mode shows different performance according to the target application requirement and the channel status. Thus, in this paper, we propose a network-adaptive selection of transport error control (NASTE), where transport-layer error control modes are dynamically selected and applied. First, an effective embedded (software-based) realization of error control modes is proposed to support the flexible mode switching for NASTE. We then present a practical yet effective mode switching algorithm by linking channel/application monitoring, table-guided mode switching decision, and subsequent fine-tuning on error-control mode parameters. Finally, we have implemented a prototype video streaming system with NASTE support and verified it over an IEEE 802.11 g WLAN (wireless LAN) environment. The experimental results indicate that the proposed mechanism can enhance the overall transport performance by recovering packet losses and thus improves the quality of video streaming over WLAN.	algorithm;automatic repeat request;channel length modulation;control flow;embedded software;embedded system;error detection and correction;forward error correction;interference (communication);network packet;prototype;retransmission (data networks);streaming media	Sungtae Moon;JongWon Kim	2007	2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2007.782	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;computer network	Embedded	-5.489873615984412	102.36536054099925	130596

9e0cb5d1ffe51f4ac1ca8d56bf920c190b198c94	performance impact of packet multiplexing on massive multiplayer online games	qoe;online gaming;tcm;consistency	Online games become more and more popular with the last years, and their network traffic is continuously increasing. They periodically generate a large amount of packets of relatively small size, which overload the Internet network and deteriorates its efficiency. To reduce the occupied network bandwidth by online games traffic, the so called Tunnelling, Compression and Multiplexing (TCM) approach has been recently proposed. However, even if it was claimed via a set of emulations that the TCM is expected to improve network delay and throughput, there were no theoretical nor simulation studies to demonstrate its benefits for online gaming experience which can be influenced by other network parameters as well. This paper focuses on the TCM performance evaluation for online gaming, via a careful set up of NS-3 simulations, devoted to measure performance metrics such as the transmission delay, the jitter and the arrival order of packets. It is shown that, for a small number of simultaneous players, the delay and the jitter deteriorate with the use of the TCM. On the contrary, the TCM improves the delay and the jitter in the case of a large number of players. Unfortunately, the packet order is always worse with the TCM, compared with the standard transmission protocol. However, these metrics can be greatly improved if, in addition to the TCM, the players are partitioned into groups based on their location on the game map (areas of interest).	multiplexing;network packet	Marwa Dammak;Yassine Boujelben;Noura Sellami;Iryna Andriyanova	2016			traditional chinese medicine;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;multimedia;consistency	Networks	-6.121343096364552	97.54446749586633	130641

In order to increase exploitation of network resources wisely, intelligent adaptive solutions for class based traffic regulation are needed. In particular, active queue management (AQM) is regarded as one of these solutions to provide low queuing delay and high throughput to flows by smart packet discarding. In this paper, we propose a novel AQM solution for future all-IP networks based on a reinforcement learning scheme that allows controlling both the queuing delay and the packet loss of the different service classes. The proposed approach is evaluated through simulations and compared against other algorithms used in the literature, like the random early detection (RED) and the drop from tail (DFT), confirming the benefits of the proposed algorithm.	active queue management;algorithm;citeseerx;compaq lte;floating-point unit;internet protocol suite;network packet;performance;provisioning;quality of service;queuing delay;random early detection;reinforcement learning;requirement;serial digital video out;simulation;throughput	Nemanja Vucevic;Jordi Pérez-Romero;Oriol Sallent;Ramón Agustí	2007	2007 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2007.4394713	real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;mobile computing;reinforcement learning;active queue management;computer network	Metrics	-5.26220694412867	95.86672406829781	130766

Recently, the WiMAX forum introduced MCBCS with three different types of internal data paths that differentiate the ways in which MCBCS data are packaged and delivered. In order to extend WiMAX access to the indoor users in home environment, femtocell technology has been considered. However, an application and evaluation of MCBCS structures over the WiMAX femtocell system have not been studied yet. In this paper, we therefore classify the applicable MCBCS network model for home users in femtocell systems and evaluate the performance of each model in terms of transmission overhead and buffer size required in data packaging. From the results, we note that the separated femto model using type-3 and type-4 data paths has more transmission overhead and requires more buffers than type-1, but these are reduced when the error rate decreases between the femto gateway (Fe-GW) and the WiMAX femto access point (WFAP). Moreover, we confirm that there are no differences in performance among types of model in the combined femto model.	digital photo frame;field electron emission;gw-basic;multicast;network model;numerical analysis;overhead (computing);wireless access point	Seil Jeon;Younghan Kim	2010	IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics	10.1109/TCE.2010.5606267	wimax;embedded system;data modeling;synchronization;payload;telecommunications;word error rate;computer science;engineering;telecommunications service;operating system;wireless network;network model;femtocell;server;computer network	Visualization	-16.686577367165626	90.20071468287873	130822

Nevertheless, combining accurate network parameters' estimation and flexible lightweight measurements is an open challenge. In this context, this paper proposes a self-adaptive sampling technique, based on linear prediction, which allows to reduce significantly the measurement overhead, while assuring that sampled traffic reflects the statistical characteristics of the global traffic under analysis. The technique is multiadaptive as several parameters are considered in the dynamic configuration of the traffic selection process. The devised test scenarios aim at exploring the proposed sampling technique ability to join accurate network estimates to reduced overhead, using throughput as reference parameter. The evaluation results, obtained resorting to real traffic traces representing wired and wireless aggregated traffic scenarios and actual network services, prove that the simplicity, flexibility and self-adaptability of this technique can be successfully explored to improve network measurements efficiency over distinct traffic conditions. For optimization purposes, this paper also includes a study of the impact of varying the order of prediction, i.e., of considering different degrees of past memory in the self-adaptive estimation mechanism. The significance of the obtained results is demonstrated through statistical benchmarking.	adaptive sampling;estimation theory;gibbs sampling;mathematical optimization;optimizing compiler;overhead (computing);sampling (signal processing);statistical model;throughput;tracing (software)	João Marco C.

First, the cellular interference traffic is analyzed and modeled. The interference characteristics of multi-services are investigated and the QoE perception models are presented. Also we develop the utility function and utilize the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to obtain the optimal RSF.

Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) is a recent standard for live and on-demand video streaming services, where clients adapt their behaviour on-the-fly to match regularly updated estimates of network capacity. Consumer DASH streams are likely to be bottlenecked by last-mile ISP links, and impacted by emerging active queue management (AQM) schemes being deployed to counter bufferbloat. We experimentally characterise and evaluate the impact of bottlenecks utilising PIE, FQ-PIE, CoDel and FQ-CoDel AQM schemes on DASH streams. We show that PIE's higher burst tolerance provides better streaming quality for single DASH stream over moderate to high RTT paths and when coupled with a FlowQueue scheduler's flow isolation capabilities, FQ-PIE protects DASH streams in the presence of cross-traffic.	active queue management;algorithm;bottleneck (network);bufferbloat;codel;control theory;digital distribution;download;dynamic adaptive streaming over http;experiment;freebsd;fully qualified name;hypertext transfer protocol;internet;last mile;scheduling (computing);software deployment;streaming media;testbed;user-generated content	Jonathan Kua;Grenville J.

647ae2649499d5b18e70da9c0e498ae929d3dae5	a new biologically-inspired analytical worm propagation model for mobile unstructured peer-to-peer networks		Millions of users world-wide are sharing content using the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) client network. While new innovations bring benefits, there are nevertheless some dangers associated with them. One of the main threats is P2P worms that can penetrate the network even from a single node and can then spread very quickly. Many attempts have been made in this domain to model the worm propagation behaviour, and yet no single model exists that can realistically model the process. Most researchers have considered disease epidemic models for modelling the worm propagation process. Such models are, however, based on strong assumptions which may not necessarily be valid in real-world scenarios. In this paper, a new biologically-inspired analytical model is proposed, one that considers configuration diversity, infection time lag, user-behaviour and node mobility as the important parameters that affect the worm propagation process. The model is flexible and can represent a network where all nodes are mobile or a heterogeneous network, where some nodes are static and others are mobile. A complete derivation of each of the factors is provided in the analytical model, and the results are benchmarked against recently reported analytical models. A comparative analysis of simulation results indeed shows that our proposed biologically-inspired model represents a more realistic picture of the worm propagation process, compared to the existing state-of-the-art analytical models.

Since IP networks do not generally guarantee the transmission quality, it is extremely important to design and manage the QoS (quality of service) properly. To do this, it is indispensable to develop a systematic method which estimates subjective quality based on the physical characteristics of the VoIP system. The paper investigates the performance of the existing opinion model called E-model, and proposes a method to improve it. The experimental results show that the proposed model surely improves the estimation accuracy in evaluating practical VoIP systems.	distortion;internet protocol suite;quality of service	Akira Takahashi	2004	2004 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2004.1326734	quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;voice over ip;speech processing;telephony;ip multimedia subsystem;computer security;computer network	EDA	-11.472607949167974	100.94882547031503	131912

Although these devices support different access technologies, they lack of native vertical handover support, breaking any ongoing connections whenever users switch between access technologies. In this paper we present a next-generation Internet architecture with native vertical handover support, providing mechanisms to support mobility between different access technologies without disruptions. The architecture introduces an identification layer that decouples the host identification from its location, enabling native mobility support for legacy applications. The identification layer employs cryptographic identifiers to identify end-hosts over the Internet and to provide security mechanisms for identity management during vertical handovers. As a proof of concept, a prototype was implemented and evaluated in different vertical handover scenarios in GSM, Wi-fi and wired domains.	access network;broadcast domain;cryptography;dna binding site;distributed hash table;identifier;identity management;internet;internetworking;overhead (computing);overlay network;prototype;public-key cryptography;ubiquitous computing	Walter Wong;Marcus Vinícius Lahr Giraldi;Maurício F.

We then outline how higher layer flow control protocols should behave, and outline techniques for taming the behavior of TCP, to ensure that the performance of lower layer enhancements are not compromised.	algorithm;clamper (electronics);control flow;control system;flow control (data);interaction;internet;layer (electronics);network packet;network planning and design;protocol stack;scheduling (computing)	Rami G.

IMS communication services, such as voice, video, messaging (incl. chat mode), are facilitated through designated and standardized SIP application servers. Traditionally, operators have a need for enhancing the service experience for their end-users [6]. These enhancements are implemented in the actual SIP-AS's as well as in separate application servers. Different methods are applied for connecting the separate application servers to said SIP-AS's. The advancements in service layer architecture are used also for creating services whereby a multitude of devices, using different communication protocols, are combined into a meta service. Smartphone, tablet and TV form, when connected to the IMS network, an integrated communication service. The present paper explores these advances in service layer architecture and sets out recommendations for further work.	application server;authentication;channel (communications);communications protocol;forwarding plane;hypertext transfer protocol;iptv;industry foundation classes;information management system (ims);mobile phone;multimedia telephony;orchestration (computing);real-time transcription;server (computing);service layer;smartphone;smartwatch;software deployment;speech recognition;tablet computer;telecommunications network;unreal development kit;usability;video;videotelephony;webrtc	Rogier Noldus;Ramsundar Kandasamy;Ingemar Lindblad	2015	2015 18th International Conference on Intelligence in Next Generation Networks	10.1109/ICIN.2015.7073831	quality of service;computer science;service delivery framework;distributed computing;service layer;service discovery;world wide web;computer network	Mobile	-15.614930777640827	92.02573653573688	132075

Our new approach is based on video quality measure that combines both the network quality of service (QoS) as well as the user quality of experience (QoE). The proposed approach improves the end-to-end traditional video quality control for multimedia network by including the human perception of video data, which is major concern for the video client, along with the network quality of service (QoS) measurements. We will show that the proposed QoS-QoE based video quality control algorithm can reflect both the condition of the network environment and the human perception of the received networked video data stream. According to both QoS and QoE parameters, rather than using only QoS parameter, video quality control action will satisfy the user needs more than relying only on the network conditions. Since our proposed QoE parameter Self-Reference Complex Wavelet Video Structural Similarity Index (SRCW-VSSIM) can be obtained with no reference (NF) video data, it satisfies the requirement of real-time video transmission.	algorithm;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time transcription;self-reference;structural similarity;wavelet	Biao Jiang;Tarek N.

Asymmetric access technologies such as these offer high download capacity, but moderate upload capacity. When the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is used on such access networks, performance degradation can occur. In particular, sharing a bottleneck link with different upstream and downstream capacities among competing TCP flows in opposite directions can degrade the throughput of the higher speed link. Despite many research efforts to solve this problem in the past, there is no solution that is both highly effective and easily deployable in residential networks. In this paper, we propose an Asymmetric Queueing (AQ) mechanism that enables full utilization of the bottleneck access link in residential networks with asymmetric capacities. The extensive simulation evaluation of our design shows its effectiveness and robustness in a variety of network conditions. Furthermore, our solution is easy to deploy and configure in residential networks.	access network;asymmetric digital subscriber line;asymmetric multiprocessing;bottleneck (network);call stack;download;downstream (software development);elegant degradation;internet access;oracle advanced queuing;simulation;throughput;upload	Maxim Podlesny;Carey L.

The approach has its foundation in probabilistic network management, in which performance limits and thresholds are specified in terms of e.g. probabilities or belief values. When combined with adaptive mechanisms, probabilistic approaches can potentially offer improved controllability, adaptivity and reliability, compared to deterministic monitoring methods. Results from synthetically generated and real network QoS measurements indicate that the probabilistic approach generally can perform at least as good as a deterministic algorithm, with a higher degree of predictable performance and resource-efficiency. Due to the stochastic nature of the algorithm, worse performance than expected is sometimes observed. Nevertheless, the results give additional support to some of the practical benefits expected in using probabilistic approaches for network management purposes.	deterministic algorithm;fault detection and isolation;performance evaluation;quality of service	Rebecca Steinert;Daniel Gillblad	2012	2012 8th international conference on network and service management (cnsm) and 2012 workshop on systems virtualiztion management (svm)		probabilistic analysis of algorithms;real-time computing;controllability;prediction;computer science;distributed computing;probabilistic logic;network monitoring;fault detection and isolation;communications system;computer network	DB	-5.754160004285806	89.85868269143977	132724

Our results indicate that the centralized scheme performs the best when the mobile user’s SMR (service to mobility ratio) is low and ν (session to mobility ratio) is high, while the fully distributed scheme per-forms the best when both SMR and ν are high. Through analytical results, we demonstrate that different users with vastly different mobility and service patterns should adopt different integrated location and service management methods to optimize system performance.	best practice;centralized computing;client–server model;compaq lte;operating system service management;personalization;server (computing);shingled magnetic recording;user profile	Hana Jang;Haksang Lee;Taehyun Lee;Jongpil Jeong	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-56538-5_31	service management;computer network;default gateway;computer science	Mobile	-19.834518294505898	99.25539426112472	132740
dc2265741d43c6d783a9fe4973ea8ef229c170fa	qos provision in wireless access networks: a routing perspective considering mobility	qos provisioning;wireless access network	Future wireless communications are expected to provide mobile users access to the desired service with the appropriate quality at any place. The essential elements for assembling such a vision are mobility, quality of service (QoS) provision and scalability, which are expected to be merged into the design process of wireless access networks. Internet mobility support is currently entering a mature phase in which scalable solutions provide low loss or even seamless handovers in cellular and heterogeneous mobile environments. Wireless and mobile QoS architectures extend the equivalent Internet approaches in order to accommodate the requirements associated with the presence of wireless links and mobility. Nevertheless, none of the popular mobility proposals combined with wireless and mobile QoS architectures encounter QoS in the routing function, leaving the QoS provision underutilized. QoS routing (QoSR) complements existing QoS architectures, enhancing application performance especially in the case of congestion, while providing effi cient resource management. However, QoSR was originally designed for fi xed IP networks without taking mobility into account. This paper investigates the interaction of QoSR in wireless access networks, identifying key points for the effi cient cooperation with mobility and existing QoS architectures.

Standards like MPEG-DASH defines the bitstreams conformance and decoding process, while leaving the bitrate adaptive algorithm open for research. So far, most DASH researches focus on the constant bitrate video delivery. In this paper, various bitrate (VBR) video delivery is investigated in the on-demand streaming scenario. Detailed instant bitrates of future segments are exploited in the proposed adaptation method to grasp the fluctuation traits of the VBR video. Meanwhile, the adaptation problem is formulated as an optimization process with the proposed internal QoE goal function, which keeps a good balance between various requirements. Besides, the parameters within the internal QoE function can be tuned to guarantee the flexibility of meeting different preferences. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed QoE-based video adaptation method outperforms the state-of-the-art method with a good margin.	adaptive algorithm;benchmark (computing);boulder dash;conformance testing;dynamic adaptive streaming over http;hypertext transfer protocol;mpd (programming language);mathematical optimization;optimization problem;quantum fluctuation;real-time transcription;requirement;streaming media;universal conductance fluctuations;volume boot record	Li Yu;Tammam Tillo;Jimin Xiao	2017	IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting	10.1109/TBC.2017.2687698	telecommunications;adaptive algorithm;throughput;decoding methods;real-time computing;hypertext transfer protocol;variable bitrate;computer science;constant bitrate;grasp;server	Vision	-8.846104043198594	99.10007888279284	132779

We examine a 5 month long log of user activity and traffic volume collected by a wireless network service provider operating hotspots in restaurants, serviced apartments, hotels and airports all over Australia. We categorize users based on their account time limits to analyze the impact of account stratification on the overall user behavior. A similarity index is developed to compare two datasets of unknown distributions which we then use to quantitatively compare how similar or different various types of accounts are. The user population of the network is found to be highly fluctuating, hence user specific, population independent metrics are proposed to account for this transience. We also introduce metrics to measure account time and data utilization.

We describe a set of services, a service kernel, required at the end points, for multimedia call establishment with QoS guarantees. These services provide: (1) Translation among diierent domain speciications (layer-to-layer translation) and domain-resource speciications (layer-to-resource translation); (2) Admission and Allocation of resources; and (3) Negotiation and Coordination of QoS speciications among the distributed end-points. For each service we propose architectural solutions. We are testing the service kernel with an ATM-based telerobotics application. Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees for delay sensitive networked multimedia applications must be application-to-application. Guarantees are achieved if: (1) the information is carried between end-points using delay-bounded communication protocols 6], 5], (2) the end-points use delay-bounded services of the operating system (OS) 4], 9], and (3) the application, OS and network are able to prepare and conngure the environment for delay sensitive multimedia calls with QoS guarantees. We identify a set of services required for QoS guarantees(in end-to-end multi-media establishment protocols) in a multimedia environment at the end-points. We call this set a kernel, because while additional services may be required (e.g., services for establishment of a video conference), these particular service are essential.	atm turbo;conditional (computer programming);end-to-end principle;kernel (operating system);operating system;quality of service;telerobotics	Klara Nahrstedt;Jonathan M.

c01f7731f3eeb003bafae8a6a2b0d0b4af3e53d7	applying multiple description coding to enhance the streaming scalability on cdn-p2p network	multiple description coding;p2p networks	Owing to the wide deployment of broadband networks, information can now be rapidly disseminated all over the world. Only the content of static texts and pictures has not yet met users’ demands. Along with the rapid advance of computer-related technologies, how to efficiently provide multimedia content for a large number of heterogeneous users on the Internet, especially videos, has become a noticeable issue. In this paper, we discuss the adaptation of multiple description coding (MDC) for the loopback buffering mechanism to address the issue of peer heterogeneity on content distribution network–peer to peer (CDNP2P) video-on-demand systems. Three description selection policies, Ordered, Round-Robin, and OpenLoop-First (OLF), are studied. In addition, we propose the intra-description recovery and inter-description recovery to deal with failed peers. The simulation results show that the OLF with loopback-MDC can significantly reduce the amount of uploading bandwidth of a proxy on CDN-P2P video-on-demand systems, and the inter-description recovery, sewing, can further effectively recover missing blocks and restore the continuity of a breaking sharing loop among peers.

Most of the proposed solutions rely on two main operations: prediction of delay statistics for future packets; setting of the end-to-end delay so as to limit or avoid packet losses. In recent years, a new approach has been presented, which is based on using a quality model to evaluate the impact of both packet loss and delay on the voice quality. Such a model is used to find the buffer setting that maximizes the expected quality. In this paper, we present a playout buffering algorithm whose main contribution is the extension of the new quality-based approach to the case of voice communications affected by bursty packet losses. This work is motivated by two main considerations: most of IP telephony applications are characterized by bursty losses instead of random ones; the human perception of the speech quality is significantly affected by the temporal correlation of losses. To this purpose, we make use of the extensions proposed in the ETSI Tiphon for the ITU-T E-Model so as to incorporate the effects of loss burstiness on the perceived quality. The resulting playout algorithm estimates the characteristics of the loss process varying the end-to-end delay, weights the loss and the delay effects on the perceived quality, and maximizes the overall quality to find the optimal setting for the playout buffer. The experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed technique.	end-to-end principle;expectation–maximization algorithm;experiment;network packet;playout;z-buffering	Luigi Atzori;Mirko Luca Lobina;M.

2ba38c1cfeb92ecce09ff173c6718287d0ece61d	the utility argument - making a case for broadband slas		Most residential broadband services are described in terms of their maximum potential throughput rate, often advertised as having speeds “up to X Mbps”. Though such promises are often met, they are fairly limited in scope and, unfortunately, there is no basis for an appeal if a customer were to receive compromised quality of service. While this ‘best effort’ model was sufficient in the early days, we argue that as broadband customers and their devices become more dependent on Internet connectivity, we will see an increased demand for more encompassing Service Level Agreements (SLA). In this paper, we study the design space of broadband SLAs and explore some of the trade-offs between the level of strictness of SLAs and the cost of delivering them. We argue that certain SLAs could be offered almost immediately with minimal impact on retail prices, and that ISPs (or third parties) could accurately infer the risk of offering SLA to individual customers – with accuracy comparable to that in the car or credit insurance industry – and price the SLA service accordingly.	data rate units;internet access;personalization;quality of service;service-level agreement;throughput	Zachary S.

f13245609d05c4c1d8bd428b251fc1c0d2f91f79	sdp-based quality adaptation and performance prediction in adaptive streaming of vbr videos		Recently, various adaptationmethods have been proposed to copewith throughput fluctuations inHTTP adaptive streaming (HAS). However, these methods have mostly focused on constant bitrate (CBR) videos. Moreover, most of them are qualitative in the sense that performance metrics could only be obtained after a streaming session. In this paper, we propose a new adaptation method for streaming variable bitrate (VBR) videos using stochastic dynamic programming (SDP).With this approach, the system should have a probabilistic characterization along with the definition of a cost function that is minimized by a control strategy. Our solution is based on a new statistical model where the future streaming performance is directly related to the past bandwidth statistics. We develop mathematical models to predict and develop simulation models to measure the average performance of the adaptation policy. The experimental results show that the prediction models can provide accurate performance prediction which is useful in planning adaptation policy and that our proposed adaptation method outperforms the existing ones in terms of average quality and average quality switch.

It is why we propose a version of our cooperative application framework (CAliF), called CAliF Web, based on Web-services. SOAP has been chosen to transmit discrete flows because of its total integration to Web technologies. Nevertheless, performances of this middleware are not well-known for continuous flow transmissions. Video transmission tests we realized prove that three possible configurations for continuous media flow transmissions allow an efficient transmission of real-time data over the platform. The first one is based on RTSP which is the most efficient. But the disadvantage of this solution is that RTSP packets may be stopped by security policies over the Web. That is the reason why an HTTP streaming configuration is available too. Nevertheless, HTTP streaming does not include required mechanisms for regulation. SOAP offers solutions for streaming, called SOAP DIME. Since this configuration is based on SOAP over HTTP, chunks transmitted may not be stopped by most of security policies over Internet. It allows a better supervision for the whole platform. Tests we performed show that a regulation strategy has to be implemented too with this last configuration.	application framework;hypertext transfer protocol;middleware;performance;push technology;real-time data;soap;web service;world wide web	Fabien Hantz;Julien Henriet	2005	First International Conference on Distributed Frameworks for Multimedia Applications	10.1109/DFMA.2005.39	web service;computer science;information security;operating system;database;multimedia;internet privacy;law;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Metrics	-15.521545908035224	94.1088841782839	133948
2c437e9c5bc1974dd69ef30bb79b895178f0f4b6	registration procedures for soif template types		Status of this Memo This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. It does not specify an Internet standard of any kind. Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. Abstract The Summary Object Interchange Format [Ref. 1] was first defined by the Harvest Project [Ref 2.] in January 1994. SOIF was derived from a combination of the Internet Anonymous FTP Archives IETF Working Group (IAFA) templates [Ref 3.] and the BibTeX bibliography format [Ref 4.]. The combination was originally noted for its advantages of providing a convenient and intuitive way for delimiting objects within a stream, and setting apart the URL for easy object access or invocation, while still preserving compatibility with IAFA templates. SOIF uses named template types to indicate the attributes which may be contained within a particular summary object. Within the context of a single application, private agreement on the definition of template types has been adequate. As SOIF objects are moved among applications, however, the need for standard, well-specified, and easily identifiable template types increases. This need is particularly intense in the context of query referral, where knowledge of an attribute's definition and the allowed data types for specific values is crucial. For a discussion of this in the context of the Common Indexing Protocol, see [Ref. 1]. The registration procedure described in this document is specific to SOIF template types. There is ongoing work within the IETF to specify a more generic schema registration facility[Ref. 5]. It is not yet clear whether the results of that work will encompass the ability to register entities like SOIF template types. If it does so, the registration of SOIF template types may be shifted to that method and registry. Should that occur, appropriate pointers will be created in cooperation with the Registrar to ensure that no registrations are lost.

BT’s recent transformation from a dominant fixed line Telco in the UK to a leading networked ICT service provider worldwide has spurred our researches in this and allied field so as to provide value-added services and solutions, addressing the increasing needs of security, safety, cost reduction and intelligence gathering from multi-national corporate customers. Our research has been of both an applied nature, creating end-to-end robust solutions here and now, and as an enabler to track state-of-the-art technology trend allowing for innovative business propositions for emerging applications. In this presentation, I’ll discuss several recent research projects within our Visual Computing and Multimedia Understanding Theme. These include real-time crowd congestion gauging; abnormal activities visualisation and detection in nonlinear subspace; skimming video from news genre to home videos; mixed traffic counting at distance, etc. In each case, a brief review is given in respect of the project’s objective, practical challenges, technical approach and evaluation procedure. Video examples will then be shown to demonstrate the promising results obtained in realistic video scenarios, and to point out any opening problems. Where appropriate we will also discuss the issues how to bridge the gap between a prototype video analytic function and its applicability in real-time real-world surveillance environment.	closed-circuit television;end-to-end principle;landline;network congestion;nonlinear system;prototype;real-time clock;real-time locating system;robustness (computer science);visual computing	Li-Qun Xu	2009	2009 Sixth IEEE International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance	10.1109/AVSS.2009.110	service provider;computer vision;simulation;visualization;computer science;analytic function;multimedia;world wide web	Robotics	-14.792433783797648	98.35801846400464	134072
0bd95b5f290c6c09101a8635c882e9e7f193c75a	understanding the intermittent traffic pattern of http video streaming over wireless networks	streaming media bandwidth ieee 802 11 standard youtube protocols bit rate throughput	We are experiencing huge growth of video streaming traffic, which is creating big challenges for video providers in guaranteeing a satisfactory level of viewing experience to end users. Furthermore, the increase in video streaming demands on mobile devices over dynamic wireless links is creating another obstacle toward providing a high quality video service. In order to overcome most of these challenges, HTTPs adaptive video streaming technology was introduced, along with other great features for streaming videos. However, we found that HTTPs adaptive protocol can still suffer under certain situations and conditions. Mostly, these issues are likely experienced when multiple concurrent players compete over the same bottleneck. Several studies have proposed a network side solution at the home gateway or at the cloud aiming to assist the video players to maximize the viewing experience to all users sharing the same bottleneck. Although these proposed systems could provide some enhancements to the video streaming, they are unable to provide fine-grained monitoring and understanding of the video traffic to apply desire level of dynamic resource management. Considering the above issues, in this paper we conduct extensive analysis of the video traffic of YouTube; the most popular HTTPs adaptive video player. In our study, we argue that through a deep understanding and careful analysis of the HTTPs video traffic, valuable information about the competing streams can be obtained and could be utilized in developing a network based solution that can significantly improve the video QoE and assist the video players to perform much better.	bottleneck (engineering);display resolution;https;hypertext transfer protocol;mobile device;streaming media	Ibrahim Ben Mustafa;Mostafa Uddin;Tamer Nadeem	2016	2016 14th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks (WiOpt)	10.1109/WIOPT.2016.7492905	simulation;telecommunications;computer science;video tracking;multimedia;computer network	Metrics	-8.660036035839129	98.66514067553787	134150

Computing Environments (CE) define the characteristics of the required hardware and software from enterprise servers down to handheld devices. The distinct Network Environments (NE) at these CEs influence the computing technologies, standards, and methods that can be effectively used in the COE. This paper details this influence based on a combination of system implementation experiences, field experimentation, and product and method surveys. To set the stage, the high-level features of the NEs are surveyed, considering how attributes such as hub-and-spoke, peer-to-peer, asymmetric bandwidth, loss and latency, per-node and special-use bandwidth allocation impact the various CEs. Several high-level transport problems are considered against these attributes: voice communications; video distribution; Situational Awareness (SA) via short status messages; and generic file distribution. Current and potential adaptations to the various portions of LandWarNet are compared, such as strategies (e.g., push versus pull) and transport protocols. The types of both CEs and NEs available at various locations, from high-performance servers supported by high-bandwidth, high-availability networks to handheld devices with intermittent communications, impact the applicable methods and standards. This study identifies common transport needs and NE-based responses to enable a COE to address diverse applications deployed in many environments.	computer hardware;connection-oriented ethernet;data center;digital distribution;experiment;high availability;high- and low-level;landwarnet;mobile device;operating environment;peer-to-peer;requirement;sensor;usb hub	Robert E.

An adaptive forward error correction (FEC) protocol is described, which adjusts the level of redundancy in the data stream in response to packet loss conditions. The proposed protocol is intended for use on a proxy server that supports mobile users on a WLAN. The software architecture of the proxy service and the operation of the adaptive FEC protocol are described. The performance of the protocol is evaluated using both experimentation on a mobile computing testbed as well as simulation. The results of the performance study show that the protocol can quickly accommodate worsening channel characteristics in order to reduce delay and increase throughput for reliable multicast channels.	computer;error detection and correction;experiment;forward error correction;mobile computing;mobile device;multicast;network packet;proxy server;qr code;server (computing);simulation;software architecture;software engineering;software propagation;testbed;throughput	Philip K.

This paper focuses on the design, empirical evaluation, and analysis of TCP throughput predictors. We first classify TCP throughput prediction techniques into two categories: Formula-Based (FB) and History-Based (HB). Within each class, we develop representative prediction algorithms, which we then evaluate empirically over the RON testbed. FB prediction relies on mathematical models that express the TCP throughput as a function of the characteristics of the underlying network path. It does not rely on previous TCP transfers in the given path, and it can be performed with non-intrusive network measurements. We show, however, that the FB method is accurate only if the TCP transfer is window-limited to the point that it does not saturate the underlying path, and explain the main causes of the prediction errors. HB techniques predict the throughput of TCP flows from a time series of previous TCP throughput measurements on the same path, when such a history is available. We show that even simple HB predictors, such as Moving Average and Holt-Winters, using a history of few and sporadic samples, can be quite accurate. On the negative side, HB predictors are highly path-dependent. We explain the cause of such path dependencies based on two key factors: the load on the path and the degree of statistical multiplexing.	algorithm;autoregressive integrated moving average;bottleneck (network);branch predictor;kerrison predictor;mathematical model;memory dependence prediction;multiplexing;network congestion;path dependence;predictor–corrector method;tcp congestion control;testbed;throughput;time series	Qi He;Constantinos Dovrolis;Mostafa H.

With video being a major player in Internet traffic and undergoing exponential growth in wireless domain, we argue for the need of a Video-aware MAC (VMAC) to significantly improve the throughput and delay performance of real-time video streaming service. VMAC makes two changes to optimize wireless LAN for video traffic: (a) It incorporates a Perceptual-Error-Tolerance (PET) to the MAC frames by reducing MAC retransmissions while minimizing any impact on perceptual video quality; and (b) It uses a group NACK-based Adaptive Window (NAW) of MAC frames to improve both throughput and delay performance in varying channel conditions. Through simulations and experiments, we observe 56--89% improvement in throughput and 34--48% improvement in delay performance over legacy DCF and 802.11e schemes. VMAC also shows 15--78% improvement over legacy schemes with multiple clients.	acknowledgement (data networks);design rule for camera file system;emoticon;experiment;real-time clock;real-time transcription;simulation;streaming media;throughput;time complexity;vmac;window function	Eilwoo Baik;Amit Pande;Prasant Mohapatra	2015	TOMCCAP	10.1145/2744412	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	-6.785140286726358	99.28233817448333	135883

In order to keep the network scalability, schemes to assure the safety of services should preferably adopt a distributed architecture, such as the reputation systems architectures, commonly used in peer-to-peer networks. Reputation systems have the goal of evaluating individual peers, relying on their previous interactions in the network. We propose the use of a service-oriented reputation system based on fuzzy logic, as a solution to increase the security at the service level of a wireless MAN.

The SDN centralized control technology enables household devices to have virtualized services with quality of service (QoS) guarantee. SDN-enabled open application programming interfaces (APIs) allow Internet service providers (ISPs) to perform bandwidth slicing in home networks and implement time-dependent hybrid pricing. Given the requests from household devices for virtualized and non-virtualized services, we formulate a Stackelberg game to characterize the pricing strategy of ISP as well as bandwidth allocation strategy in home networks. In the Stackelberg game, the leader is the ISP and the followers are the home networks. We determine the optimal strategies which provide maximal payoff for the ISP. Numerical results show that our proposed SDN-enabled home network technology with the hybrid pricing scheme provides a better performance than a usage-based pricing scheme tailored for best-effort home networks.	application programming interface;best-effort delivery;centralized computing;maximal set;programming paradigm;quality of service;software-defined networking	Homa Eghbali;Vincent W.

192da1af28cdb247646c10997bf92e8bf22bd336	revisiting benchmarking methodology for interconnect devices		Ever growing demand for network bandwidth makes computer networks an area of constant development and fast adjustments. The steady change makes good performance assessments equally necessary and challenging. This development motivated us to revisit the established benchmarking methodology. We provide an overview of the state-of-the-art in router benchmarking, the currently available benchmarking tools, and challenges for benchmarks. A discussion of benchmarking results for three different devices (routers based on Linux and FreeBSD, and a MikroTik router) reveal different properties currently not covered by standardized benchmarks. We conclude by adding tests to the common benchmarking methodology reflecting these properties to make the results more valuable. The prototype software implementation of our own benchmarking tool and its measurement reports are publicly available.	benchmark (computing);freebsd;linux;prototype;router (computing);steady change	Daniel Raumer;Sebastian Gallenmüller;Florian Wohlfart;Paul Emmerich;Patrick Werneck;Georg Carle	2016			reliability engineering;real-time computing;simulation;engineering	Metrics	-6.429164241871575	92.51000259762606	136258

However, end users have not seen corresponding increase in application throughput mainly because (i) the existence of high-bandwidth links has shifted the congestion from the network to end hosts, and (ii) such congestion is not well handled by TCP's Additive Increase and Multiplicative Decrease algorithm. Particularly, due to the sharing with unknown background workloads, the data receiver oftentimes lacks sufficient system resources to process the arriving packets, hence leading to significant packet drops at the end system. This paper proposes a UDP-based transport method that incorporates a performance-adaptive flow control mechanism to regulate the activities of both the sender and receiver in response to system dynamics to achieve high throughput. We construct a mathematical model for the socket receive buffer and data receiving process, and employ a profiling-based method to estimate the initial receiving bottleneck rate, which is dynamically adjusted and sent back to the sender for source rate control. The sending rate is stabilized at the estimated bottleneck rate based on a stochastic approximation algorithm. We test the proposed method on a local dedicated connection and the experimental results illustrate its superior performance over existing methods.	additive model;approximation algorithm;control theory;converge;data rate units;end system;flow control (data);mathematical model;network congestion;network packet;performance prediction;profiling (computer programming);queueing theory;stochastic approximation;system dynamics;throughput	Xukang Lu;Chase Qishi Wu;Nageswara S.
