We present a time series approach using Dynamic Linear Models to decompose the daily aggregated conversions into seasonal and trend components. We attribute the difference between control and study trends to the campaign. We test the method using two real campaigns run for 28 and 21 days respectively from the Advertising.com ad network.	display advertising;experiment;linear model;randomized algorithm;time series	Joel Barajas;Ram Akella;Marius Holtan;Jaimie Kwon;Aaron Flores;Victor Andrei	2013		10.1145/2487788.2487842	simulation;computer science;attribution	HCI	-92.71983488652585	-19.159532761861218	23267

The survey and analysis are follow-ups to the work of Plaisent and Bernard (1993) [6] [M. Plaisent, P.M. Bernard, Electronic mail: Efficient and effective or a fad?, European Business Review 93 (1993) 27-30]. The results are that email is ranked higher on all five of the attributes analyzed: efficiency, convenience, preference, most-used, and importance. In addition, it appears that email is increasingly taking on the role of DSS, being used in problem-solving, and continues to constitute about half of the activity regarding the exchange of information.

They can be exploited for attracting touristic flows towards cultural destinations. In particular, virtual tours are new tools based on advanced 3D graphics that can be useful for promoting arts and culture. In this paper, we test users’ acceptance of virtual tours as a tool supporting their decision to visit a touristic destination. A new virtual tour has been developed for promoting a site with a high archaeological value in the south of Italy. Acceptance of this system has been tested on a sample of 100 interviewees. Data were analysed using structural equation modelling (SEM). All the hypotheses were supported indicating the robustness of TAM model for explaining the intention to use virtual tours while deciding on touristic destinations. Results also showed the importance of enjoyment while using the tool to explain acceptance.	3d computer graphics;ibm tivoli access manager;structural equation modeling;virtual tour	Eleonora Pantano;Vincenzo Corvello	2014	IJTM	10.1504/IJTM.2014.059232	innovation;simulation;economics;cultural heritage;marketing;technology management;virtual reality;multimedia;advertising;management;tourism	Visualization	-92.62246410367408	-12.639328708595025	30312

Despite the significant backing these projects receive from governments and other large organizations, there are very few rigorous studies which measure their actual impact and utility. We have developed and deployed a software PC logging tool that allows us to gain exact quantitative insight into the usage statistics of kiosks on which the tool is installed. In field trials in Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, India, we collected over 120 days of software tool logging data from 13 separate kiosks, while we also questioned the kiosk operators during the same period. We show some evidence that the software based logging tool complements the existing survey based and other ethnographic approaches for data collection. We also show that the tool does a better job in gathering certain usage statistics as compared to questioning the kiosk operator	algorithm;data logger;interactive kiosk;programming tool	Rajesh Veeraraghavan;Gauravdeep Singh;Kentaro Toyama;Deepak Menon	2006	2006 International Conference on Information and Communication Technologies and Development	10.1109/ICTD.2006.301870	embedded system;application software;simulation;computer science;engineering;evaluation;operating system;methodology;software measurement;law;world wide web;computer security;government;statistics;data collection;logging	SE	-92.94607034931153	-3.9874695795657304	30346

a1ad7469e2bb75618b86aea40439b3fba7fcb63f	comprehension of ads-supported and paid android applications: are they different?		The Android market is a place where developers offer paid and-or free apps to users. Free apps can follow the freemium or the ads-business model. While the former offers less features and the user is charged for unlocking additional features, the latter includes ads to allow developers to get a revenue. Free apps are interesting to users because they can try them immediately without incurring a monetary cost. However, free apps often have limited features and-or contain ads when compared to their paid counterparts. Thus, users may eventually need to pay to get additional features and-or remove ads. While paid apps have clear market values, their ads-supported versions are not entirely free because ads have an impact on performance. The hidden costs of ads, and the recent possibility to form family groups in Google Play to share purchased apps, make it difficult for developers and users to balance between visible and hidden costs of paid and ads-supported apps. In this paper, first, we perform an exploratory study about ads-supported and paid apps to understand their differences in terms of implementation and development process. We analyze 40 Android apps and we observe that (i) ads-supported apps are preferred by users although paid apps have a better rating, (ii) developers do not usually offer a paid app without a corresponding free version, (iii) ads-supported apps usually have more releases and are released more often than their corresponding paid versions, (iv) there is no a clear strategy about the way developers set prices of paid apps, (v) paid apps do not usually include more functionalities than their corresponding ads-supported versions, (vi) developers do not always remove ad networks in paid versions of their ads-supported apps, and (vii) paid apps require less permissions than ads-supported apps. Second, we carry out an experimental study to compare the performance of ads-supported and paid apps and we propose four equations to estimate the cost of ads-supported apps. We obtain that (i) ads-supported apps use more resources than their corresponding paid versions with statistically significant differences and (ii) paid apps could be considered a most cost-effective choice for users because their cost can be amortized in a short period of time, depending on their usage.	amortized analysis;android;emoticon;experiment;file system permissions;list comprehension;megabyte;play store;refresh rate;vii	Rubén Saborido;Foutse Khomh;Giuliano Antoniol;Yann-Gaël Guéhéneuc	2017	2017 IEEE/ACM 25th International Conference on Program Comprehension (ICPC)		computer science;multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web	SE	-92.02973355155423	-13.265930359608436	30775

A reasonable subscriber classification could produce an effective market pricing that could increase operator's revenue and market share. But how can we find this reasonable classification? This paper studies on mobile subscriber's revenue and behavior, and then build subscribers' classification model, which could explain some marketing activities, such as pricing. To the topic of mobile subscriber classification, there are some papers studies on, but most of them focus on subscribers' revenue and few focuses on subscribers' behavior. This paper's innovation is to study subscriber classification on both revenue and behavior. This paper refers to the method of data mining, model building, model illustration and model application.	data mining	Haiming Fu;Lingling Zhang;Yong Shi	2007	Fourth International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD 2007)	10.1109/FSKD.2007.561	pricing;market share;model building;mobile telephony;market price;consumer behaviour	ML	-92.55378978946868	-7.54791342482094	31826

This was motivated by booming global e-business and the resulting popularity of cross-country e-negotiation. A laboratory e-negotiation experiment was conducted with two groups who used native and nonnative language in negotiation separately. We found that language familiarity has a positive effect on both language self-efficacy and negotiation self-efficacy. Moreover, mediated effect analyses revealed a critical effect path from language self-efficacy to negotiation self-efficacy to communication efficiency to communication effectiveness to persuasion behavior. This indicates that language familiarity is the fundamentally critical factor in guiding persuasion behavior since it can affect both language self-efficacy and negotiation self-efficacy. Therefore, determining how to improve both language self-efficacy and negotiation self-efficacy when negotiating in a nonnative language is very important. Finally, possible contributions provided by information technology are proposed from the viewpoint of the information systems discipline.	electronic business;information system	Hsiangchu Lai;Wan-Jung Lin;Gregory E.

8214a0fd6125406c0986bca6da7f448216a1d7ab	how awareness and valuation of the future jointly shape intertemporal financial decisions		We examine people’s preferences about whether to engage in discretionary spending vs. save their money and find that reduced spending in the present requires the combination of both being motivated to provide for one’s future self (valuing the future) and actively considering long-term implications of one’s choices (awareness of the future). Feeling more connected to the future self—thinking that the important psychological properties that define your current self are preserved in the person you will be in the future—provides the motivation for people to make far-sighted choices by changing the valuation of future outcomes. However, this change only reduces spending when opportunity costs are highlighted.	discretionary access control;value (ethics)	Daniel M.

Utilizing capital markets and information theory to compare the business models, the research looks at specific market mechanisms instantiated in PriceScan, NetMarket, and Bottom Dollar. The web sites supporting the market structures were also evaluated on trust mechanisms, reputational ratings, information quality, availability, speed, and liquidity. Twenty standard, consumer products offered through these markets were evaluated over a three-month period examining pricing, availability, and speed of response.There were significant differences across the three models. Direct search and broker models had the highest availability and quickest response. Brokers made the greatest use of trust mechanisms. Direct search and dealers offered the greatest liquidity. Information quality was the highest in the dealer, with strong market, price movement, and product information. Lowest overall prices were consistently evident in the direct search. Allocational efficiency was difficult to determine, but an evaluation of the earlier efficiencies suggests that in situations where consistent market availability is not required, overall the direct search model is the most allocationally efficient. In situations requiring immediate market availability, the broker model appears to be the most allocationally efficient with quick response, competitive prices, and good information quality.The paper extends earlier work in business models and market efficiencies by comparing specific instantiations of the models and developing definitions for and a typology of efficiencies based on capital markets theory. In addition, the paper includes technical and qualitative analysis of Web sites supporting the business models.	algorithmic efficiency;biological anthropology;computational trust;electronic markets;information quality;information theory;pricescan;world wide web	Jonathan W.

e73c3f665fc599fec38523e99719ce79646e0e01	a fork in the road: a conceptual model of online consumer iterative search	goal orientation	Lower searching cost and access to large amounts of information on the Internet are making a consumer’s search more iterative. Through a synthesis of literature from consumer behaviour and information science, we propose a process model of online consumer search in which a consumer may move forward in the process towards a final product selection, but also is likely to backtrack to an earlier stage to revise their search. Our process model steps through a consumer’s need, search criteria, alternatives, evaluation, and final selection, including an option of iteration within the evaluation stage. Future research will fully investigate the entire process model, but in this paper we focus on the evaluation stage and the resulting search iteration. In the online context, as a consumer evaluates alternative products, the consumer is also engaged in a learning process where the consumer may identify the need to update the functional product attributes and/or the hedonic product attributes of the search criteria or alternatives, which leads to a new iteration of the search process. The product consumption goals of a consumer (i.e., prevention, promotion) are theorized to also influence the search process leading to iteration. Hypotheses and future research opportunities are outlined.	backtrack;fork (software development);information science;internet;iteration;process modeling;theory;web search engine	Chen Zhang;Anssi Öörni;William J.

Recently GA management has observed that the organization’s growth trajectory is stagnating. While other aquariums face a similar trend, GA wants to be proactive and reverse this direction. They face a multifaceted business challenge involving four conflicting objectives: (1) How to increase revenues without increasing ticket prices; (2) how to increase attendance without compromising visitor satisfaction; (3) how to increase the impact of media investments without spending more; (4) how to attract customers with long-term value potential. To address these challenges, we developed an integrated approach consisting of multiple marketing science models including Data Envelopment Analysis, Competition Analysis, Spatial Analysis, Media Optimization Analysis, and Pass Holder Lifetime Net Revenue Analysis. Based on the findings of our analyses and the parameter estimates of our models, GA proceeded with a field implementation to validate our suggestions. As a result, they realized a 10% increase in attendance and a 12% increase in revenue in 2013, thereby enhancing their bottom line and growth.Data, as supplemental material, are available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2015.0932 .	marketing science	Vikash Kumar;Amalesh Sharma;Naveen Donthu;Carey Rountree	2015	Marketing Science	10.1287/mksc.2015.0932	economics;linear regression;marketing;operations management;spatial analysis;advertising;statistics	Logic	-94.53127242872307	-10.483496634035403	66033

By evaluating car exterior designs based on shape similarities, it is possible to find the distributions of the typical design elements and novel design elements. These can then be compared with looking probabilities on design elements observed from eye tracking experiments to conduct a Design Intent Analysis. We have identified that the participants’ viewing patterns are related to the degree of shape similarities of particular design elements such as the front bumper, side silhouette, and side front fender. We observed no significance in regard to subjects’ looking probabilities in relation to design intent of the other 16 design elements. Thus, the design intent of the car brands does not correlate with the user responses. The contribution of this paper is twofold: providing systematic measures and promoting practical possibilities for design quantification. The design field relies heavily on expert knowledge; an empirical understanding of designer intent and user response therefore can provide quantifiable insight to automobile companies. Based on our findings, companies could investigate how creating unique designs may not always be good strategies for improving design qualities, brand recognition or even purchase intent. Companies can efficiently and strategically manage design costs, which are directly related to the manufacturing cost.		Kyung Hoon Hyun;Ji-Hyun Lee;Minki Kim	2017	J.

Of interest is how the joint distribution, and in particular the correlation, of the values users assign to components of a bundle affect its odds of success. The results offer insight and guidelines for deciding when bundling new Internet technologies or services can help improve their overall adoption.

The results of exploratory factor analysis support the validity of the measures developed. In addition, the regression analysis results of a model including the three constructs provide strong support for the relationship between perceived vulnerability and privacy concerns, but only moderate support for the relationship between perceived ability to control information and privacy concerns. The latter unexpected results suggest that the relationship among the hypothesized antecedents and privacy concerns may be one that is more complex than is captured in the hypothesized model, in light of the strong theoretical justification for the role of information control in the extant literature on information privacy.	internet privacy	Tamara Dinev;Paul J.

Furthermore, we hope to find that different kinds of SMS failure may have different effects on brand trust also. Data were gathered using a scenario-based experiment by designed four service failure scenarios. The survey carried out some research aims at the college students (N = 175) who had mobile phones by using the method of questionnaire. The results show that there is a significant negative correlation between the SMS service failure and brand trust. The Spam message and wrong coding message have worse impact on the brand trust. The designed four scenarios are so popular in China today that almost every mobile phone subscribers had encountered more than once. Although essential to experimental manipulation, participants’ actually experience responses to our scenarios may be more accuracy than role playing method.	mobile phone;spamming	Liu Dan;Li Ying;Fang Xianpeng	2009	2009 10th ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligences, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing	10.1109/SNPD.2009.112	computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;short message service	SE	-92.88667682123496	-15.815721903084446	82032

For this, Kano's method classifies customer needs into different categories. Besides the attractiveness, the attribute's importance for the customer might be also relevant for User Experience. Thus, we combine Kano's method and the conjoint analysis for the identification of attributes, which are attractive and important for the user. Using this methodology, we are able to select the more favorable attribute of two attributes, which reached the same result in Kano's method. Furthermore, we apply this methodology on charging systems for electric vehicles as a case study. The results of the case study revealed the benefits of applying the methodology in analyzing customer needs.	user experience	Danilo Marcello Schmidt;Josu Urquidi Guerrero;Ioanna Michailidou;Udo Lindemann	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management	10.1109/IEEM.2014.7058849	customer to customer;voice of the customer;user experience design;economics;computer science;human factors and ergonomics;marketing;operations management;kano model;conjoint analysis;customer intelligence;advertising;customer satisfaction;customer retention	Robotics	-92.58847498899577	-7.4957138903914196	87040

These electronic functionalities converged devices with powerful contents and functions, such as the World Wide Web, videoconferencing, e-mail, internet telephony, online gaming, digital television, and net banking, are easier to use than traditional computers but not less capable of performing daily tasks. These information technology revolutions along with rapid growing of network technology not only increased the amount of internet applications and digital contents, but also led to diversified consumer behaviors, increased competition, and opportunities. On the other hand, one-to-one marketing is different from traditional marketing methods because it focuses on customer satisfaction and is customer-oriented rather than focusing on marketing mass consumers; thus a one-to-one marketer tries to find more different products and services for the same customer. Therefore, how to establish potential cross-selling and one-to-one offers through product mix analysis, enhance relationship with customers by means of personalized offers through product knowledge, and understand users' needs and making useful suggestions for new product developments and one-to-one marketing become critical issues to information appliance firms. This paper proposes association rules, clustering analysis and CART as methodologies of data-mining, which is implemented for mining product and marketing knowledge from information users. Knowledge extraction from information users is illustrated as knowledge patterns, rules, clusters, and trees in order to propose suggestions on one-to-one marketing for information appliance firms.	information appliance;one-to-one (data model);personalized marketing	Shu-Hsien Liao;Chyuan-Meei Chen;Chia-Lin Hsieh;Shih-Chung Hsiao	2009	Expert Syst.

Several alternatives involve a physical device or token. We investigate one such alternative, Pico: an authentication scheme that utilizes multiple wearable devices. We present the grounded theory results of a series of semi-structured interviews for exploring perceptions of this scheme. We found that the idea of carrying physical devices increases perceived personal responsibility for secure authentication, making the risks and inconvenience associated with loss and theft salient for participants. Although our work is focused on Pico, the results of the study contribute to a broader understanding of user perception and concerns of responsibility for any token-based authentication schemes.	authentication;mental model;password;peripheral;pico;requirement;security token;semiconductor industry;usability;user requirements document;wearable technology	Jeunese A.

Particularly, usage and satisfaction are explored as the consequences of attitude towards DMB, while informativeness, entertainment and interactivity are the antecedents of attitude towards DMB. This relational model was tested with a Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) approach. SEM results indicated that the uses and gratifications theory explains users’ attitudes towards DMB. DMB users who perceive it as entertaining and informative generally show a positive attitude towards DMB. In addition, the interactivity of DMB has a significant relation with the users’ positive attitudes towards DMB. Finally, this study found that DMB users with a positive attitude towards DMB watch its content more often and feel more satisfied.	information;interactivity;path analysis (statistics);relational model;structural equation modeling	Dong-Hee Shin	2008	IJMC	10.1504/IJMC.2008.016580	path analysis;structural equation modeling;entertainment;systems modeling;computer science;digital broadcasting;multimedia;television;interactivity;scanning electron microscope;world wide web	HCI	-92.62569627363987	-11.203489991914088	99775

46f05cecdf69c6ed3c9c11d0d9bb9d9886b46547	mining device-specific apps usage patterns from large-scale android users		When smartphones, applications (a.k.a, apps), and app stores have been widely adopted by the billions, an interesting debate emerges: whether and to what extent do device models influence the behaviors of their users? The answer to this question is critical to almost every stakeholder in the smartphone app ecosystem, including app store operators, developers, endusers, and network providers. To approach this question, we collect a longitudinal data set of app usage through a leading Android app store in China, called Wandoujia. The data set covers the detailed behavioral profiles of 0.7 million (761,262) unique users who use 500 popular types of Android devices and about 0.2 million (228,144) apps, including their app management activities, daily network access time, and network traffic of apps. We present a comprehensive study on investigating how the choices of device models affect user behaviors such as the adoption of app stores, app selection and abandonment, data plan usage, online time length, the tendency to use paid/free apps, and the preferences to choosing competing apps. Some significant correlations between device models and app usage are derived, leading to important findings on the various user behaviors. For example, users owning different device models have a substantial diversity of selecting competing apps, and users owning lower-end devices spend more money to purchase apps and spend more time under cellular network.

031584aa134a723171a3ddea5ad70b7f376f2bde	analyzing online sentiment to predict telephone poll results	article	The telephone survey is a common social science research method for capturing public opinion, for example, an individual's values or attitudes, or the government's approval rating. However, reducing domestic landline usage, increasing nonresponse rate, and suffering from response bias of the interviewee's self-reported data pose methodological challenges to such an approach. Because of the labor cost of administration, a phone survey is often conducted on a biweekly or monthly basis, and therefore a daily reflection of public opinion is usually not available. Recently, online sentiment analysis of user-generated content has been deployed to predict public opinion and human behavior. However, its overall effectiveness remains uncertain. This study seeks to examine the temporal association between online sentiment reflected in social media content and phone survey poll results in Hong Kong. Specifically, it aims to find the extent to which online sentiment can predict phone survey results. Using autoregressive integrated moving average time-series analysis, this study suggested that online sentiment scores can lead phone survey results by about 8-15 days, and their correlation coefficients were about 0.16. The finding is significant to the study of social media in social science research, because it supports the conclusion that daily sentiment observed in social media content can serve as a leading predictor for phone survey results, keeping as much as 2 weeks ahead of the monthly announcement of opinion polls. We also discuss the practical and theoretical implications of this study.	attitude;autoregressive integrated moving average;autoregressive model;coefficient;influenza virus a hong kong ab:acnc:pt:ser:qn;kerrison predictor;landline;sentiment analysis;social sciences;social media;time series;user-generated content	King-wa Fu;Chee-hon Chan	2013	Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking	10.1089/cyber.2012.0375	psychology;medicine;computer science;social psychology	HCI	-92.14805431557465	-19.38745837480275	113019

Using partnership data made available by cricinfo during the Ashes 2013 Test series, we generate batting partnership network (BPN) for each team, in which nodes correspond to batsmen and links represent runs scored in partnerships between batsmen. The resulting network display a visual summary of the pattern of run-scoring by each team, which helps us in identifying potential weakness in a batting order. We use different centrality scores to quantify the performance, relative importance and effect of removing a player from the team. We observe that England is an extremely well connected team, in which lower order batsmen consistently contributed significantly to the team score. Contrary to this Australia showed dependence on their top order batsmen. Cricket as a complex network The tools of social network analysis have previously been applied to sports. Such as a network approach was developed to quantify the performance of individual players in soccer [1] and football [2]. Network analysis tools have been applied to football [3], Brazilian soccer players [4], Asian Go players [5]. Successful and un-successful performance in water polo have been quantified using a network-based approach [6]. Head-to-head matchups between Major League Baseball pitchers and batters was studied as a bipartite network [7]. More recently a network-based approach was developed to rank US college football teams [8], tennis players [9] and cricket teams and captains [10]. The central goal of network analysis is to capture the interactions of individuals within a team.

The overall aim of the larger project has been to explore the existing legal mechanims for the protection of the rights of consumers in their sequenced genetic data in the context of DTCGT. There are several areas of law which could be drawn upon to regulate the industry or which may have relevance for the protection of consumers (data protection, medical device regulation, consumer protection, product liability, and human rights). However, the current mechanism governing the transaction between the consumer and company when an individual purchases a genetic test from a DTCGT company is that website's contract, normally to be found on websites as Terms of Use, Terms of Service, Terms and Conditions, Privacy Policy or Privacy Statement.	information privacy;privacy policy;purchasing;relevance;terms of service	Andelka M.

08ca7d718302f03e089cbed07e48ef120ff271df	web content usage behavior: a case study of a university in sub-saharan africa	internet usage;traffic classification;user behavior;web log mining	This study characterizes the behavior of students in one of the Sub-Saharan Africa universities with respect to usage of valuable, but expensive Internet resources in a developing economy. Traffic allocation to web domains was compared with known statistical distributions such as Zipf and Stretched exponential distributions. Observed results show that traffic allocation follows stretched exponential distribution and that students use only small fraction of traffic for actual education activities and the rest of the traffic is associated with video services and social networks. The cumulative results from male and female students’ hostels show gender differences in browsing habits. More importantly, actual usage is at variance with the surveys conducted by OFCOM in UK and those conducted among students at the university, thus showing that usage patterns significantly differ from surveys result and between the users in advanced and developing economies.	exponential time hypothesis;internet;social network;time complexity;web content;zipf's law	Sergey Butakov;Augustine Odinma;Evgeny Grakhov	2009			web service;web application security;web mining;web development;web analytics;web standards;computer science;web navigation;multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web	Web+IR	-94.6040259866702	-13.733309782760717	130295

Data from comScore is analysed using an innovative application of set theory. ComScore is a leading commercial provider of business intelligence and consumer analytics based on its worldwide panel of two million online users. The search process is modelled using the concept of the consideration set based on primary search with the airline websites and secondly by the use of online travel agents and meta-search engines, which are termed comparison websites. Three generic search models are proposed: (1) primary search with airline websites only; (2) search of comparison websites only; (3) a combination of primary search and comparison websites. Each generic search model accounts for a significant proportion of overall users in both markets. The consideration sets are 2.58 in Germany and 2.74 in the United States. It is shown that the use of comparison websites significantly increases the propensity to conduct additional primary search based on analysis of all major airline pairs in both markets. The theoretical and managerial implications of the results are described and future research opportunities are outlined.		Christopher Patrick Holland;Julia A.

ee073c6ddb0e24860a93109f864376129a94d2dd	privacy in the smart grid: end-user concerns and requirements		Mobile interfaces will be central in connecting end-users to the smart grid and enabling their active participation. Services and features supporting this participation do, however, rely on high-frequency collection and transmission of energy usage data by smart meters which is privacy-sensitive. The successful communication of privacy to end-users via consumer interfaces will therefore be crucial to ensure smart meter acceptance and consequently enable participation. Current understanding of user privacy concerns in this context is not very differentiated, and user privacy requirements have received little attention. A preliminary user questionnaire study was conducted to gain a more detailed understanding of the differing perceptions of various privacy risks and the relative importance of different privacy-ensuring measures. The results underline the significance of open communication, restraint in data collection and usage, user control, transparency, communication of security measures, and a good customer relationship.	privacy;requirement;smart meter;usage data;user interface	Lisa Diamond;Johann Schrammel;Peter Fröhlich;Georg Regal;Manfred Tscheligi	2018		10.1145/3236112.3236139	end user;computer security;data collection;open communication;smart grid;smart meter;customer relationship management;business;usage data;user requirements document	HCI	-94.06215492357781	-14.939530905987581	138571

Tracked records of searches are used for descriptive analysis of transitional patterns in the data. Regression is used for statistical verification of the information provided by searches.Findings – Consumer searches center on chaining events, indicating heavy reliance on hyperlink navigation between web sites. Formal searches are seldom used, although when employed, tend to have a high level of diagnosticity. The emphasis on heuristic behavior is logical, as the way consumer information is currently presented on the internet rewards for this type of behavior.

d815fde244e81aec785744a06fb54ddeb29cc08b	using social media to monitor mental health discussions - evidence from twitter	arima;twitter;health communication;mental health;social media	Objectives Given the public health importance of communicating about mental illness and the growing use of social media to convey information, our goal was to develop an empirical model to identify periods of heightened interest in mental health topics on Twitter.   Materials and Methods We collected data on 176 million tweets from 2011 to 2014 with content related to depression or suicide. Using an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) data analysis, we identified deviations from predicted trends in communication about depression and suicide.   Results Two types of heightened Twitter activity regarding depression or suicide were identified in 2014: expected increases in response to planned behavioral health events, and unexpected increases in response to unanticipated events. Tweet volume following expected increases went back to the predicted level more rapidly than the volume following unexpected events.   Discussion Although ARIMA models have been used extensively in other fields, they have not been used widely in public health. Our findings indicate that our ARIMA model is valid for identifying periods of heightened activity on Twitter related to behavioral health. The model offers an objective and empirically based measure to identify periods of greater interest for timing the dissemination of credible information related to mental health.   Conclusion Spikes in tweet volume following a behavioral health event often last for less than 2 days. Individuals and organizations that want to disseminate behavioral health messages on Twitter in response to heightened periods of interest need to take this limited time frame into account.	am broadcasting;arima;autoregressive integrated moving average;autoregressive model;depressive disorder;digital media;electronic supplementary materials;ethinyl estradiol;government agencies;handling (psychology);illness (finding);mcc protocol;manuscripts;norm (social);octal;projections and predictions;regulatory submission;risk management;shock;social media;substance-related disorders;terminator 2: judgment day;time series analysis;disclaimer;interest;late nucleophagy;mental health;message	Chandler McClellan;Mir M.

The purpose is to generate many very good alternatives for a specific new product. Subsequently, a comparative evaluation of these alternatives and honing the designs of the most promising ones can proceed. To create potential alternatives with high customer appeal, the approach first elicits and organizes customer values to comprehensively define customer appeal. Several procedures are then defined and illustrated that use these customer values to stimulate the creation of alternative new product designs and design features. Applications concerning one tangible product, cellular telephones, and one intangible product, cellular telephone plans, illustrate the approach.	customer relationship management;display resolution;mobile phone;organizing (structure)	Ralph L.

This study summarized 4 dimensions and 21 factors that affect festivals and mega events, identified their structural relationship using DEMATEL (decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory), and obtained the key factors and improvement points., DANP (the DEMATEL-based analytic network process)was employed for calculating influential weights to obtain the influential weights among critical factors. The subject was the 2011 Taipei International Flora Expo, and data collection was based on a questionnaire survey of 26 experts. The results showed that the first dimension of festivals and mega events is “entertainment” and the second is “transport”. Thus, by improving these two dimensions, the tourists' satisfaction and revisit intention will be enhanced. In addition, according to weighting, the influential weight of information (0.2784) is the highest; this is because clear indication of information, such as the event flow, location, and routes, can improve public satisfaction.

Although there have been some observations on the mobile application (app) popularity in Android appstores, there is no report on the app popularity in iOS appstores. What's more, the details about user downloads and app popularity, such as the composition of downloads traffic and the migration of user interests, are untouched yet. In this paper, we unreel these issues based on five-month measurements of four third-party appstores (two for Android and two for iOS respectively).  Our main results include: 1) The app popularity distributions of third-party Android appstores are different from those of iOS third-party appstores. There is an exponential cut-off observed besides the Zipf-like distribution in the app popularity distribution of Android appstores. 2) In both Android and iOS families of appstores, the major part of downloads traffic is contributed by the large-size apps, counting 80% or more in the volume of total downloads traffic. 3) There is less rank variance of the most popular apps in the iOS appstores than those in the Android appstores. About 52% of the top 100 iOS apps observed in one month are still in the rank of top 100 in the following four months.	android;digital distribution;mobile app;time complexity;zipf's law;zipf–mandelbrot law;ios	Wei Liu;Ge Zhang;Jun Chen;Yuze Zou;Wenchao Ding	2015		10.1145/2757384.2757392	computer science;advertising;internet privacy;world wide web	Metrics	-94.5506934635839	-13.620744521363923	163584

Whereas the response rates in this research resembled earlier studies, replies arrived faster; the  average response time was under 10h compared to over 20h in previous studies. Similar to earlier research, organisational  characteristics — hotel size and hotel category — showed few significant relationships to responsiveness but did relate to  response quality. The results also show significant differences in quality aspects between the replies to emails sent in two  languages: German e-mails were answered with a higher quality and with a higher probability, but in about the same time as  English e-mails. To some extent, language related to the hotels’ email responses.  	switzerland	Roland Schegg;Andreas Liebrich;Fang Liu;Jamie Murphy	2006		10.1007/3-211-32710-X_48	economics;computer science;response rate;advertising;management;social psychology	NLP	-92.08853697280001	-20.88394936238746	163806
6f61a33fbb9cba26ffd3bf4691230b8a14708040	feeling secure vs. being secure the mobile phone user case		In this work, we are comparing the subjective security feeling of mobile phone users to the (objectively agreed) best security practices. This was possible by statistically processing a large pool of 7172 students in 17 Universities of 10 European countries. We introduced a “mean actual security value”, comparing their security practices to best practices. There was a clear negative connection between feeling secure and actually being secure. Users that feel that mobile phone communication is secure, tend to be less cautious in their security practices. Moreover, we extracted profiles of students according to their mobile phone communication security feeling. These profiles belong to well defined categories. Users, exhibit different values of a metric that we named “mean security feeling value” according to their age, field of study, brand and operating system of phone, connection type, monthly bill and backup frequency. These results can help both academia and industry focus their security awareness campaigns and efforts to specific subsets of users that mostly need them. Finally, as there are not available any already validated questionnaires in regards to this specific research topic, our research, apart from revealing the situation, aims at providing a basis for the formulation of similar questionnaires for future use.	backup;best practice;communications security;mobile phone;operating system;security awareness	Iosif Androulidakis;Gorazd Kandus	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-33448-1_29	gsm services;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-93.03462943236939	-15.630062854856801	167037

This study focuses on online auction sites in Taiwan, investigating products, auction rules, and trading types adopted by these sites. Based on the three layers of value creation in the Rayport–Sviokla model, results from the 25 sites show that brand-new products are offered more than used ones, and easily describable products are more popular. For auction types, English is the most common one. On the other hand, consumer-to-consumer (C-to-C) trading types are more popular than business-to-consumer (B-to-C) counterparts. Also, most auction site owner’s act as intermediaries only. With respect to product delivery, participants usually have to manage the delivery process themselves. The cross-analyses between trading types and product types and between roles of site owners and number of product categories provided are also conducted.

Most of new products can be assumed as combinations of existing products. All of the combinations do not always become seeds of new selling product. Each existing product has functions. A new function may be thought up by combining two existing products. If a thought up function is feasible, a combination may be a seed of new selling product. This paper proposes a feasibility evaluation system of function obtained by product combination for supporting idea creation of new product. The system makes phrases representing new functions obtained by product combination. The system evaluates whether each of new functions is feasible or not. The system outputs combinations with feasible functions. We experimented with the proposed system, and obtained two findings: (1) Ideas of high novelty were obtained from combinations with functions of low feasibility. (2) Ideas of high utility were obtained from combinations with two new feasible functions.	scott continuity	Yoko Nishihara;Junya Hibino;Jun-ichi Fukumoto;Ryosuke Yamanishi	2014	2014 IIAI 3rd International Conference on Advanced Applied Informatics	10.1109/IIAI-AAI.2014.13	simulation;engineering;marketing;operations management	HPC	-94.01138014905794	-7.532367429519852	172866

In this paper, we describe a system to automatically monitor and analyze customer feedback through various social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, etc. and detect issues faced by the customers. Business organizations can use this system to engage with their customers and help alleviate the problems faced by them. The system uses statistical event detection techniques for identifying various customer issues. The system offers a batch version as well as real time version of event detection algorithm depending upon the client's requirements. We also describe a few case studies illustrating the utility of our proposed system for business organizations in identifying issues faced by their customers through social media channels.	algorithm;requirement;social media	Sumit Bhatia;Jingxuan Li;Wei Peng;Tong Sun	2013	2013 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM 2013)	10.1145/2492517.2500287	renewable energy;customer to customer;social network analysis;social science;energy;social media optimization;customer reference program;data mining;customer intelligence;customer satisfaction;world wide web;statistics;customer advocacy	DB	-93.84764833958788	-17.618831071883857	174607

0384d72afdd5b592f5407105eb2333c277c88cd2	social promoter score (sps) and review network: a method and a tool for predicting financial health of an online shopping brand		Conventional way of summarizing customers’ ratings or sentiment of reviews on products of an online shopping brand are not sufcient to evaluate the nancial health of that brand. It overlooks the social standing and inuence of individual customers. In this paper, we have proposed a tool named as Review Network for measuring inuence of customers in online merchandise sites like Amazon.com. Using this measured inuence, we have proposed a method that evaluates loyalty of customers of a brand based on their ratings and sentiments of their reviews collected from online merchandise sites. Review network of a brand is built from all the reviews of all the products from that brand where nodes are customers and an edge is created if a customer becomes a potential reader of a review wrien by another customer. Centrality of a customer in that review network represents her inuence. Our proposed method named as Social Promoter Score (SPS) combines loyalty and centrality of all customers of a brand. We have compared our method with a base line approach named as SPS-R based on the concept of NPS®[21]. We have applied SPS on Amazon.com review data set of some well known brands, i.e., Nokia, Samsung, Philips, Canon, Lenovo etc. Results show that SPS predicts nancial health of a brand in terms of future sales much beer than SPS-R. We have noticed that in general eects of SPS reect on product sales in one to ve months.	centrality;experience;ibm 1401 symbolic programming system;online shopping;recommender system;social network	Supriyo Mandal;Abyayananda Maiti	2018	CoRR		social status;computer science;product (business);net promoter;loyalty;finance;centrality	AI	-92.72448557194723	-9.198600520004014	181239

A doi:10.1016/j.eswa.2012.01.066 ⇑ Corresponding author. Address: School of Manage 1 Hoegi-Dong, Dongdaemoon-Gu, Seoul 130-701, Rep 9355; fax: +82 2 961 0515. E-mail address: jaek@khu.ac.kr (J.K. Kim). In this study, we propose a product network analysis, a network-based analysis to analyze a networkleveled relation among all products. Compared to market basket analysis, which focuses on the transaction-leveled relation between products, the suggested product network analysis focuses on extended network-leveled point of view of the relation between all products. For such a purpose, we suggest two kinds of product networks, market basket networks and co-purchased product networks. Two networks are comparatively evaluated to analyze the topological characteristics and the structure of those networks. The extended use of market basket analysis, network-leveled analysis are expected to be more effectively and efficiently used in personalized services, such as cross selling, up selling, and personalized product display utilizing the deep relation between products. 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, behavioral theory suggests that context affects user attitude and therefore influences acceptance. We therefore hypothesized that the benefits of mobile systems should be evaluated against users' contextual needs and that reduced dependence on time and place required providing service at any time and place needed by the user. Mental costs or costs of learning to use the system, however, may not be evaluated in the same way, because system use and learning about it are acts with different contexts. Our findings advance knowledge of IT adoption and suggest that we should start to identify the contexts of both the benefits of use and in learning to use the system.	mobile ticketing	Niina Mallat;Matti Rossi;Virpi Kristiina Tuunainen;Anssi Öörni	2009	Information & Management	10.1016/j.im.2008.11.008	attitude;simulation;mobile commerce;computer science;engineering;wireless network;advertising;mobile computing;perception;computer security	Mobile	-92.37479519724636	-9.948871012556385	187920
f0312c877a5eab2464d29641c7b1f91d6d7c4de3	interactive e-billboard combined with guide system: using kinect		Abstract In this study, an interactive electronic guide system is proposed and designed by combining the important information of social media extracted from the websites. The proposed system allows companies to improve product promotion, as well as enhances consumer efficiency in understanding how well the products are. We develop an interactive interface to assist the subjects to control the guide system based on the Kinect somatosensory camera, which can lead to high visibility and better quality of guide. In addition, the proposed back-end system can determine the requirements of consumers and set the appropriate strategies after the analysis of guide information. Experimental results indicate that the proposed system has the advantages of interacting with users through a somatosensory detection device, showing the information users need with a dynamic website, recording users’ operations and generating a chart with cross-platform database after the analysis. The results are also recommended that it is suitable to be applied in these fields, such as product displays and educational training in business organizations, service situations and policy advocacy in government agencies, exchange rate information and stock market in banking and finance, and etc.	kinect	Wei-Yen Hsu	2017	Telematics and Informatics	10.1016/j.tele.2017.06.004	simulation;marketing;computer science;dynamic web page;social media;government;chart;policy advocacy	HCI	-92.50060696263972	-12.690046508950157	190590
981d7ba63a4ed3bbe90c89bde431296f4a356606	contributors' withdrawal from online collaborative communities: the case of openstreetmap		Online collaborative communities are now ubiquitous. Identifying the nature of the events that drive contributors to withdraw from a project is of prime importance to ensure the sustainability of those communities. Previous studies used ad hoc criteria to identify withdrawn contributors, preventing comparisons between results and introducing interpretation biases. This paper compares different methods to identify withdrawn contributors, proposing a probabilistic approach. Withdrawals from the OpenStreetMap (OSM) community are investigated using time series and survival analyses. Survival analysis revealed that participants’ withdrawal pattern compares with the life cycles studied in reliability engineering. For OSM contributors, this life cycle would translate into three phases: “evaluation,” “engagement” and “detachment.” Time series analysis, when compared with the different events that may have affected the motivation of OSM participants over time, showed that an internal conflict about a license change was related to largest bursts of withdrawals in the history of the OSM project. This paper not only illustrates a formal approach to assess withdrawals from online communities, but also sheds new light on contributors’ behavior, their life cycle, and events that may affect the length of their participation in such project.	collaborative software;enterprise life cycle;hoc (programming language);online community;openstreetmap;reliability engineering;schedule (computer science);social inequality;time series;trusted computer system evaluation criteria;whole earth 'lectronic link	Daniel Bégin;Rodolphe Devillers;Stéphane P Roche	2017	ISPRS Int.

Experiences for services still remain in customers' brain or heart after the services are finished. Their main aim is to share customers' experiences and find suitable service by analyzing information shared after service providing. In the proposed model, the direct service field and the indirect service field are prepared. In the indirect service field, customers share their service experience by using Information Technology Web2.0, Social Network. Suitable services can be found by analyzing information in the indirect service field. The effectiveness of this new model is demonstrated through its application to Korean language education during a 14week period.

8faaf63e1b162ee7269ff340b9432c777553770f	customer life time value model framework using gradient boost trees with ransac response regularization		For many years, Customer lifetime value has been a mainstay concept in direct response marketing and has been increasingly considered. This paper presents a mathematical model framework for determination of customer lifetime value. The proposed multi-layer framework is based on a systematic theoretical taxonomy and on assumptions grounded in customer behavior. CLV, a recent marketing paradigm, pursues long-term relationship with profitable customers. It can be a starting point to understand relationship management and measure the true value of customers to be deployed toward the targeted customers and profitable customers, to foster customers’ full profit potential. Corporate success depends on an organization ’ ability to build and maintain loyal and valued customer relationships. In this paper, we propose a framework for analyzing customer value and segmenting customers based on their value. We also conducted an in-depth data analysis to find each member’s behavior and important attributes which plays a significant role in calculating CLV in multiple revenue bands. From the experimental validation, we concluded that our proposed framework works much better in predicting customer’s life time value in terms of revenue compared to other methods in past literature.	customer relationship management;gradient;layer (electronics);mathematical model;matrix regularization;programming paradigm;random sample consensus;taxonomy (general);time value of money	Lavneet Singh;Alejandro Montes Muñoz;Girija Chetty	2018	2018 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	10.1109/IJCNN.2018.8489710	market segmentation;machine learning;consumer behaviour;ransac;decision tree;artificial intelligence;artificial neural network;customer lifetime value;customer relationship management;revenue;marketing;computer science	AI	-92.6710185040355	-7.56896363134823	193550

First, it proposes the 3-dimentional framework model of customer identification, which incorporates the dimensions of Customer Lifetime Value, Customer Perceived Value, and Accessibility under Competition. Second, it analyses the significance of customer identification to customer retention theoretically through establishing customer identification model. Third, it explains the procedure and method of customer retention decision-making based on customer identification. Finally, by establishing the decision-making model of customer retention, it analyses the pricing strategies incorporating the factor of customer loyalty under two pricing modes respectively, which are uniform pricing and discriminating pricing. The customer retention strategy basing on customer identification can improve the efficiency of customer retention greatly, so, it is of great instructive significance to the implementation of CRM.	accessibility;artificial consciousness;customer relationship management;online advertising;relevance	Yan Luo	2011	2011 Eighth International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD)	10.1109/FSKD.2011.6019887	pricing;enterprise relationship management;customer to customer;voice of the customer;customer;customer relationship management;customer lifetime value;loyalty business model;cognitive neuroscience of visual object recognition;customer equity;customer reference program;customer delight;customer intelligence;customer profitability;customer satisfaction;customer retention;service quality;relationship marketing;conversion marketing;customer advocacy	ML	-92.39025126905801	-8.580245951270747	193750
