53adeac7040125e06da8a6fcfb9e03514951bc42	repainting the business model canvas for peer-to-peer sharing and collaborative consumption		Sharing Economy businesses have become very popular recently but there is little guidance available on how to develop the respective business models. We faced this problem during a consortium research project for developing a service for electric vehicle charging that adopts the paradigm of Peer-to-Peer Sharing and Collaborative Consumption (P2P SCC)—a specific branch of the Sharing Economy. We use Action Design Research (ADR) to develop an adapted version of the Business Model Canvas that is specifically tailored to the needs of P2P SCC business model development. The adapted canvas is then applied to develop a business model for the proposed service. The learnings from the development process are formalized into a set of generally applicable guidelines for the development of P2P SCC business models. The resulting guidelines and the adapted canvas provide guidance for both researchers and practitioners who want to either develop new or analyze existing P2P SCC business models.	business model canvas;collaborative consumption;peer-to-peer;programming paradigm;source code control system	Florian Plenter;Erwin Fielt;Moritz von Hoffen;Friedrich Chasin;Michael Rosemann	2017			marketing;business model canvas;knowledge management;peer-to-peer;design research;computer science;business model;sharing economy	Web+IR	-92.14712701024341	-27.8660777819193	56400

In combination with specific cases, the complete design and implementation process of the teaching evaluation data warehouse is given. Based on this, a multidimensional cube of teaching evaluation is created. Through the multidimensional analysis for it, the useful knowledge hidden in the data is obtained. It provides strong support for objectively evaluating teacher by managers and improving teaching by teachers.	big data;binary-coded decimal;data in use;data mining;entity–relationship model;failure;han unification;jamie bartlett (journalist);jamie wilkinson;john d. wiley;microsoft sql server;multi-core processor;multidimensional analysis;online analytical processing;online transaction processing;pei-yuan wei	Tong Wang	2018	2018 IEEE/ACIS 17th International Conference on Computer and Information Science (ICIS)	10.1109/ICIS.2018.8466446	online analytical processing;data mining;multidimensional analysis;data warehouse;data modeling;computer science	DB	-92.4771130664708	-31.165656101469125	164197

For an online community to start and proceed on to a sustainable operation, it is important that members are encouraged to contribute positively and frequently. We decided to introduce gamification in an online community that we designed and developed with the Australian Government’s Department of Human Services to support welfare recipients transitioning from one payment to another. We first defined a formal model of gamification and a gamification design process. In instantiating our model to the online community, we realised that our context applied a number of constraints on the gamification elements that could be introduced. In this paper, we outline the design and implementation of a gamification model for online communities and its instantiation into our context, with its specific requirements. While we cannot comment on the success of gamification to drive user engagement in our context (for lack of the possibility of a controlled experiment), we found our implementation of badges-based gamification a helpful way to provide a useful abstraction on the life of the community, providing feedback enabling us to monitor and analyze the community. We thus show how feedback provided by such gamification data has a potential to be useful to community providers to better understand the community needs and addressing them appropriately to maintain a level of engagement in the community.	abstraction layer;context (computing);gamification;mathematical model;norm (social);online community;portals;requirement;social network;the australian;universal instantiation	Sanat Kumar Bista;Surya Nepal;Cécile Paris;Nathalie Colineau	2014	Int.
