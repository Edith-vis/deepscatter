598faac1215dff1ce6d95eb2cccc9a4605d76db2	expanding the horizons of digital social networks: mixing big trace datasets with qualitative approaches	qualitative research;trace data;social networks;social network analysis;research challenges;social media	Article history: Received 21 November 2014 Received in revised form 10 March 2016 Accepted 15 March 2016 Available online xxxx The study of social networks has attracted much interest from the IS community in recent years, driven mainly by the accessibility of trace data that remain as a by-product of interactions conducted through technology-enabled platforms. Despite its rapidly growing influence, we have some concerns about the current trajectory of social network research in the IS field. Our purpose in this commentary piece is to accentuate for the new generation of social network researchers, who are au fait with mathematical techniques for analyzing massive digital datasets, how the combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches can enrich our understanding of networks. First we highlight how the social network perspective has contributed to our understanding of IS phenomena. Next we review mixed methods research in IS social network research. An agenda for future IS social network research is then presented where we suggest how qualitative approaches can best complement trace data in addressing focal social network questions. We conclude by discussing the challenges of conducting mixed method studies of digitally enabled social networks. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

During this period, Taiwan ranked within the top 30 countries by number of highly cited papers, defined in Thomson Reuters’ Essential Science Indicators (ESI) as those that rank in the top 1 % by citations for their category and year of publication. Taiwan made notable progress in world-class research in the two consecutive 5-year periods 2000–2004 and 2005–2009. For the group of highly cited papers from Taiwan, USA, China, Germany, and Japan were the top collaborating countries over the decade. In recent years, Taiwan has increasingly collaborated with European countries whose output of highly cited papers is relatively high and increasing, rather than with its neighboring countries in Asia. Overall, Taiwan produced highly cited papers in all the 22 ESI subject categories during the 10-year period. Taiwan’s output of highly cited papers was greatest in the categories of Engineering, Clinical Medicine, and Physics, while those in Agricultural Sciences and Mathematics exceeded the expected output level in relative terms. More detailed analyses would be useful for a holistic understanding of Taiwan’s research landscape and their progress in world-class research, combining both bibliometric and non-bibliometric data, such as researcher mobility, research grants, and output from internationally-collaborated research programs.	bibliometrics;holism	Nobuko Miyairi;Han-Wen Chang	2012	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-012-0722-9	bibliometrics;computer science;data mining;world wide web	ML	-76.62672665843317	-20.509870551842365	20492

b02b770ea3d93b534cd8b0acc4c3e096aebd35a9	reasons to believe: influence of credibility on motivations for using social networks	uses and gratifications;facebook;twitter;credibility;blogs	One question that has troubled credibility researchers is why do people rely on media that they do not deem credible? This question has also arisen with the coming of social media, which is increasingly relied on for news and information despite its low credibility ratings. This study compares perceptions of credibility of political information found on Facebook, blogs, and Twitter to credibility of information found on traditional media and it investigates if credibility ratings influence motives for using social media for political information. This study found that all traditional media except Fox News were rated more credible than social media sites, which suggests that sources that strive to present news that is fair and unbiased are judged more credible. But traditional news sources are only rated as moderately credible, which indicates that they are not measuring up to the standards of journalistic integrity. Credibility of social media consistently influenced motivations for using them, suggesting that gratifications obtained from these sources may be strong enough that users are willing to trade credibility for need satisfaction. 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

From our experiences, we learned that researchers should be prepared to study and work in ways that recontextualize their understanding of the world based on the unique place in which they are working. Further, researchers should take into account their own footprint as they transit, stay, eat, and work in areas of the world less familiar to them. Ethical research must also consider the positionality of study participants, accounting for the ways in which they also experience privilege.

Spouse/partner and parent/parent-in-law are found to provide diffuse support, serving both instrumental and emotional functions. Compared to kin ties, support from coworkers are likely to be more specialized and secondary. These findings are inconsistent with earlier data collected by Ruan and her associates in Tianjin. They observe that work-related ties are more prevalent than kin ties in the Chinese support networks and are more likely to be preferred helpers for a variety of problems. Moreover, the roles of family ties (parent, child, and sibling) tend to be peripheral and highly specialized, mainly, in money issues. Differences in findings from the two cities are attributed partly to the different measures of social support and partly to the different social structures related to marketization. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

b9c1d0cfaf298f50c13cc88916650549b9deb729	measuring consumer perception of social media marketing activities in e-commerce industry: scale development & validation		This study developed a scale for perceived social media marketing activities (SMMA) of e-commerce.Employed a blend of qualitative and quantitative research to develop the scale.The study offers implications of perceived SMMA of e-commerce for academics and managers. The internet has changed the nature of shopping in the past two decades, which has supported the proliferation of e-commerce sites and thus shopping has shifted to e-shopping. Also, customers use social media to gain information on preferred products with the best price options, as social media provides shoppers a voice, and facilitate them to interact and share their opinion worldwide. Moreover, social media is extensively adopted platform for e-commerce. Although, social media marketing has achieved wide acceptance in business, especially in e-commerce, there is no scale in the extant literature to measure perceived social media marketing activities (SMMA) in an e-commerce context. Therefore, this study develops and validates a 15-item, five-dimensional scale for measuring perceived SMMA of e-commerce based on extant literature on e-commerce and social media marketing and five different studies conducted in this research. The scale revealed comprehensive psychometric characteristics as per the results from the diverse reliability and validity checks. It was revealed that perceived SMMA positively influenced purchase intention and brand equity; which endorses the nomological validity of the developed scale. The new scale provides both theoretical as well as managerial implications along with the avenues for forthcoming research.	e-commerce;online shopping;social media marketing	Mayank Yadav;Zillur Rahman	2017	Telematics and Informatics	10.1016/j.tele.2017.06.001	public relations;marketing;nomological network;e-commerce;computer science;perception;the internet;brand equity;extant taxon;social media	AI	-88.65442042594941	-10.637765340288809	20646

The nature and extent of perceived gender balance is examined in terms of overall composition of editorial positions, journal prestige and the specific area within IS covered by a journal. The results indicate that perceived gender balance of editorial positions reflects that of ICT academia generally, and that female representation appears to be concentrated in journals covering areas that are traditionally seen as female occupations, e.g., health, education, librarianship. As such, little or no encouragement is given to females considering an IS academic career.	color balance;gender hci;library science	John W.

Suppliers of devices, services, and infrastructure regularly point to the high levels of penetration of, say, mobile phones or broadband in countries around the world. While this is indeed true in many societies, the levels of penetration are less extensive in others where the reality remains stubbornly less than the hype. Many people view the products of information age and the knowledge economy as troublesome intrusions, expensive luxuries, or, at worst, irrelevant to their daily lives. The tools of the current information age are badly designed, wide open to misuse, and, for some users, a tool for abusive behavior. The precautionary principle is ignored in the rush to market by suppliers of ICT products and services. Terminals and services are so feature rich that users who are not technological adepts find them difficult to use. The lack of systematic training and investment has created digital divides between those who can cope with the explosion of ICT products and services and those who cannot, whether for reasons of age, ability, or economic disadvantage. To see the full reality of today's information revolution in microcosm, one must simply examine the use of ICT products and services by young children. From four or five years of age they now have mobile phones, and both in school and at home they use the Web every day. Young people are routinely using ICT products and services that were originally designed for use by adults. Their ability to pester adults to buy products and services is clearly being abused. It is hardly surprising that the use of the current information-age tools by young children is causing problems for these children. They suffer from the poor design of keyboards and screens [1]. They misuse text messaging and Web services such as """" Am I Hot or Not? """" to bully and abuse others [2]. Guidelines are so weakly enforced that young children can easily gain access to harmful images and video material [3]. ICT products and services are being used by suppliers of products such as unhealthy food and drink to target young children [4]. Services, such as mobile location, are open to abuse by those dysfunctional elements in society who seek to prey on young people [5]. This is the reality of today's information society. To the problems experienced by young children can be added the thousands of examples of the difficulties of others. …"""	failure;information revolution;mobile phone;prey;rating site;relevance;requirement;web service;world wide web	Anne M.

a42f93642b84735fb13c9001c29fd59f5489758d	public value innovation: a theoretical framework based on system dynamics		The capability to innovate is seen as fundamental to solve the current challenges posed to governments and to create public value to society. However, many studies in the public sector field did not link innovation to existing theories. There are calls for a systemic approach to understand public sector innovation and its complexity, but there are few studies on how to develop a comprehensive analytical model that fits this need. This essay aims to contribute to fill this gap with the development of a theoretical framework to demonstrate how public sector innovations affects public value in a systemic context. We discuss that (1) Public Value Theory (PVT) is adherent to analyze public sector innovation, given its focus on the effects of government action; (2) public sector innovations foster the development of organizational capabilities (Public Service Delivery, Resource Acquisition, Co-production and Public Engagement), which in turn contribute to public value creation in a complex and intertwined manner better captured through System Dynamics. We argue that joining this theoretical fields can elucidate complex and non-linear relationships regarding public sector innovation, assisting scholars and public managers to understand aspects of the organizational environment that can increase or decrease the public value delivered to society over time.	fits;itil;nonlinear system;system dynamics;theory	Leonardo Ferreira de Oliveira;Carlos Denner dos Santos Júnior	2018		10.1145/3209281.3209357	public engagement;knowledge management;public relations;public sector;public service;system dynamics;computer science;government;public value	HCI	-78.64787405947534	0.08132659072730668	20778

It is important to investigate what these indicators actually measure to assess their appropriateness in scholar ranking and benchmarking average individual levels of performance. 17 author-level indicators were calculated for 512 researchers in Astronomy, Environmental Science, Philosophy and Public Health. Indicator scores and scholar rankings calculated in Web of Science (WoS) and Google Scholar (GS) were analyzed. The indexing policies of WoS and GS were found to have a direct effect on the amount of available bibliometric data, thus indicator scores and rankings in WoS and GS were different, correlations between 0.24 and 0.99. High correlation could be caused by scholars in bottom rank positions with a low number of publications and citations in both databases. The hg indicator produced scholar rankings with the highest level of agreement between WoS and GS and rankings with the least amount of variance. Expected average performance benchmarks were influenced by how the mean indicator value was calculated. Empirical validation of the aggregate mean h-index values compared to previous studies resulted in a very poor fit of predicted average scores. Rankings based on author-level indicators are influenced by (1) the coverage of papers and citations in the database, (2) how the indicators are calculated and, (3) the assessed discipline and seniority. Indicator rankings display the visibility of the scholar in the database not their impact in the academic community compared to their peers. Extreme caution is advised when choosing indicators and benchmarks in scholar rankings.	aggregate data;benchmark (computing);best, worst and average case;bibliometrics;citation index;coefficient;computer performance;cross-validation (statistics);database;design rationale;fits;google scholar;mathematical model;mike lesser;missing data;norm (social);roland gs;web of science	Lorna Elizabeth Wildgaard	2015	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-015-1608-4	arithmetic mean;ranking;computer science;data science;data mining;world wide web;harmonic mean;statistics	Web+IR	-78.06216698986923	-21.604765961605622	20790
0a38185ac3f2bf6e9ff78516de144271a56e19e7	low status rejection: how status hierarchies influence negative tie formation		Abstract Scholarship investigating how social status patterns negative ties has yielded contradictory findings. Three likely sources for these differences are: different measures of social status, measures of negative ties (perceived versus dyadic), and structural factors. This study uses multiple measures of social status, sociometrically-measured negative ties, and multiple analytic approaches – MRQAP to control for structure and within-individual to control for heterogeneity – to help resolve this debate. We find: negative ties travel down status hierarchies and target low status individuals, and a negative tie between two people becomes more likely as their status difference increases. These results suggest a low-status rejection mechanism.	rejection sampling	Brian Rubineau;Yisook Lim;Michael Neblo	2019	Social Networks	10.1016/j.socnet.2018.08.005	scholarship;social psychology;social status;mathematics;hierarchy	ML	-88.93867576505941	-18.30862121283208	20806

From this perspective, this paper examines ITG practices in a public organization in Ghana (that has a responsibility to mobilize revenue for national development) in order to gain an insight into IT governance structures, processes and relational mechanisms and understand how this contributes to adding value through IT. The findings have revealed that this public organization has a centralized approach to IT governance, with inadequate board involvement concerning how IT investments can bring value and improve organizational performance. Furthermore, there are no IT steering and strategy committees to oversee IT governance as best practice requires.

For one who has greatly regretted her lack of editorial training, ten years (1987-96) is a good spell to clock up on one journal, and it is the ten-year rule which sees Hazel leaving this role. HKB came to the job internally as she had been the Society of Indexers’ representative to ALPSP (Council member from 1984) for some time. She was and is a busy professional indexer (450 or so compiled to date) and incidentally a teacher, who would over the years dash off from time to time on some assignment, usually in the field of English lit, the subject of her Reading degree.	compiler;philip hazel;search engine indexing	David Lee	1997	Learned Publishing	10.1087/09531519750147256	computer science;media studies;publishing	DB	-63.717650097489255	-19.981158476819367	20848

However, there is still surprisingly little research at the intersection of both fields: the adoption, diffusion and infusion of IT within corporate HR processes. This is astonishing as evolving IT support in recent years has substantially transformed HR processes showing attractive optimization potentials. In this paper, we apply findings from theory and own qualitative and quantitative research to the recruitment process. We present a stage model for the e-HR field and argue that with changing forms of IT support different theoretical models and constructs need to be applied. Also, as soon as locus of adoption and impact begin to deviate an assimilation gap emerges. We therefore adopt a user perspective and show how HR and IT managers can overcome this gap in order to successfully infuse IT in corporate recruitment processes.	americas conference on information systems;bridging (networking);data assimilation;focal (programming language);locus;mathematical optimization;norm (social);usability;user-centered design	Tobias Keim;Jochen Malinowski;Tim Weitzel	2005			engineering;knowledge management;operations management;management	AI	-77.61223631144674	1.496753255967629	20859

To overcome this information overload, appropriate Internet- based services can be introduced. To this direction, this paper presents the development and pilot evaluation of an online observatory of Greek agricultural e-markets. This observatory aims to help users that search for agricultural e- markets online, according to characteristics such as their products, their ser- vices, or their geographical coverage.	electronic markets	Nikos Manouselis;Constantina Costopoulou	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-87783-7_87	simulation;computer science;marketing;information overload;agricultural productivity;advertising;management;world wide web	ECom	-83.71328693065601	-11.106975673288337	20957

However, few researches have investigated the relationships between PIU and personality variables such as defense, coping and pathological traits. The aim of the present study was to explore the rate of PIU among French users and its relationships with psychopathological (depressive symptoms, self-esteem, pathological personality traits) and psychological variables (defense mechanisms and coping strategies). A sample of 786 participants, aged between 18 and 35 years old (M = 23.7; SD = 4.5) has been recruited online and completed several scales assessing PIU, time spent online, socio demographic, psychological and psychopathological variables. More than 20% of the sample had PIU. Compared to non-problematic users, they had significant higher scores of all personality disorder clusters, non-adaptive coping and depressive symptoms. Among the total sample, PIU was predicted by Clusters B and C personality traits, immature and autistic fantasy defense styles, non-adaptive coping strategies and depressive symptoms. Significant gender differences have been retrieved. Psychological and psychopathological variables, including personality traits should be further explored, and gender differences always taken into account when assessing PIU.	internet addiction disorder	Stéphanie Laconi;Morgane Vigouroux;Cécile Lafuente;Henri Chabrol	2017	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2017.03.025	psychology;psychiatry;psychopathology;coping;personality;social psychology;clinical psychology	HCI	-86.9258317822484	-22.045086642239564	21129

Based on series of e-service quality evaluation models which were demonstrated in previous works, the authors considered the quality of e-services in four aspects including information quality, interaction quality, process quality and outcome quality. The moderator in above relationship is business reputation. Through analysing the secondary data collected from Taobao, a popular online shopping platform, the authors implied that service guarantee strength bring significantly positive impacts on information quality and interaction quality of online merchants. Moreover, compared with high level reputation, lower level reputation will strengthen the effect of service guarantees on interaction quality. Finally, some suggestions were put forward to improve service quality for online retailers to satisfied customers.	e-services;google moderator;high-level programming language;information quality;online shopping;quality of service;reputation;taobao marketplace	Hong Peng;Wei Jiang;Ruihuan Su	2016	IJSTM	10.1504/IJSTM.2016.077654	e-commerce;service level requirement;service level objective;quality function deployment;data quality;reputation;computer science;service delivery framework;marketing;service design;service guarantee;information quality;customer satisfaction;customer service assurance;world wide web;service quality;commerce	Web+IR	-89.7017746477698	-11.686474701591031	21286

These programs are considered of strategic value to governments due to its contribution in enhancing existing identity management systems. Considering the total cost of such programs which goes up to billions of dollars, the success in attaining their objectives is a crucial element in the agendas of political systems in countries worldwide. Our experience in the field shows that many of such projects have been challenged to deliver their primary objectives of population enrolment, and therefore resulted in failing to meet deadlines and keeping up with budgetary constraints. The purpose of this paper is to explain the finding of a case study action research aimed to introduce a new approach to how population are enrolled in national ID programs. This is achieved through presenting a case study of a business process reengineering initiative undertaken in the UAE national ID program. The scope of this research is limited to the enrolment process within the program. This article also intends to explore the possibilities of significant results with the new proposed enrolment approach with the application of BPR. An overview of the ROI study has been developed to illustrate such efficiencies.	biometrics;business process;code refactoring;failure;identity management system;norm (social);operating environment;population;region of interest;text simplification	Ali M.

Classical TAM structure has been largely expended by newly added variables. Prior studies [1] have analyzed relationships among variables in TAM and found the stability of classical structure, but what about relationships between new variables and classical structure? We selected 30 articles from the main international journals for analyses. It is found that, SE SN and PBC are used mostly in extended TAM. The relations between SE, PBC and TAM are consistently significant, but the integration of SN into TAM is not so ideal. In our review scale, this relation is inconsistent. Other variables and relations are also discussed in this article. The conclusions of this article will provide guidance for future researches about extended TAM model building.	ibm tivoli access manager;periodic boundary conditions;theory	Yuanquan Li;Jiayin Qi;Huaying Shu	2007		10.1007/978-0-387-75902-9_6	systems engineering;engineering;artificial intelligence;operations management	ML	-87.83727980250532	4.050828394866273	21352

The reporter wrote, """" What might this new device be used for? Well, people at a party in Manhattan might call people at a party in New Jersey. Or, a young man might use the telephone to 'pop the question' to his true love. """" When the telephone was first deployed, many had difficulty seeing its value. Life and work were linked to the infrastructures of the time: Markets were local, and modern cities were densely constructed so that related businesses were near one another. How could the telephone compete with other technologies? The telegraph already provided transcontinental transmission. Pneumatic tube systems and couriers in London, New York, Paris, and other cities could deliver signed contracts across town in hours. How could a voice-only box possibly compete with hardcopy transmission? It took the telephone system a century to provide a rough approximation of quick document delivery, when fax machines became widely used in the 1980s. From our vantage point, one could easily assume that the Internet followed a deliberate, highly rational, and even obvious path from its beginnings to today's dominant networking technology. Many explicit goals and plans were in fact realized on the way to our ubiquitous commercial Internet. Yet, time after time, unanticipated factors, some inherent in the technology and some external, produced powerful and unexpected effects on its evolution. Social, economic, and industrial influences often had broad effects in the manner of shifting tec-tonic plates. Some were subtle, with intimate knowledge of technical issues required to understand how they had their effects. From the beginning of the 20th century and well into the 1990s, networking was dominated by telephony, which consisted almost exclusively of national champions: highly regulated post, telephone, and telegraph monopolies known as PTTs. They not only operated networks, but they also did the deployment, manufacturing , and research. Almost all were wholly owned and operated by their national governments. Many were actually government ministries. PTTs had enormous political clout. A strong PTT was considered the only way to meet the demands of national priorities, business, and the public. Often the interests of users were last in line after economic stability, national security, prestige, and what could be very substantial government revenue. This control-and-stability-first model employed research, development, and deployment cycles …"""	approximation;ccir system a;contingency (philosophy);fax;internet;requirement;security through obscurity;software deployment;timeline;williams tube	Glenn Kowack	2008	Interactions	10.1145/1330526.1330551	simulation;economics;operations management;social psychology	HCI	-70.10878922305422	-13.07107011902622	21443

The goal of our study is to investigate the influence of such interventions on schoolgirls’ intentions to choose a career in the ICT field by analysing comprehensive survey data (n = 3711), collected during four interventions in Australia, using the Partial Least Squares method. Our study is also aimed at identifying other factors influencing ICT career intentions. We found that the attitude towards interventions has an indirect influence on ICT career intentions by affecting interest in ICT. Our results also challenge several existing theoretical studies by showing that factors that had previously been suggested as influencers were found to have little or no impact in this study, these being same-sex education and computer usage.	partial least squares regression	Elena Gorbacheva;Annemieke Craig;Jenine P.

f14ac556a23d6920651cc3b2651521f792692773	a framework for using data analytics to measure trust in government through the social capital generated over governmental social media platforms		It has been noted that citizensu0027 trust in public institutions is continuously declining. Low social capital has been confirmed as one of the main reasons for this decrease in trust towards government. As social media offer a number of features that could foster social capital, governments worldwide are embracing these new tools in an attempt to restore citizensu0027 trust. Having an existence on social media doesnu0027t guarantee that it would increase trust; it can even compromise on the reputation of a public agency in the absence of a clear strategy targeted towards developing confidence and trust. To ensure the reflection of this strategy on the content of governmental social media, there should be a mechanism that measures the degree of trust on social media in government taking into account different aspects related to trust. Despite the importance of this kind of evaluation, it is though overlooked in both academia and practice. This paper therefore aims to fill this research gap through suggesting a standard technique to measure different trust dimensions on social media accounts of governments. A proposed framework for evaluating trust was applied on Facebook accounts of three Egyptian ministries - selected based on their apparent contribution to the national economy- taking into account six dimensions of trust: Responsiveness, Accessibility, Transparency, Effectiveness, Efficiency, and Participation.	accessibility;responsiveness;social capital;social media;trust metric	Nahed Azab;Mohamed ElSherif	2018		10.1145/3209281.3209331	public relations;computer science;public institution;social capital;government;data analysis;social media;reputation;compromise;information and communications technology	HCI	-79.94611546025828	-14.619246422682913	21570
b4855b02e421bab8c5146ae82b208ec0d9e56ea1	the effects of institution-based trust on community commitments: a regulatory focus perspective		This study investigates how institution-based trust affects community members' commitments toward their online communities. Drawing on trust and regulatory focus theory, our research model explains that institution-based trust (situational normality and structural assurance) influences members' community commitments and that members' regulatory foci (promotion- and prevention-focus) moderate the impacts of institution-based trust on community commitments. To test our research model, we surveyed 303 members of online communities. We find that structural assurance (not situational normality) positively affects members' community commitments. We also find that members' promotion-focused motivations moderate the relationship between situational normality and community commitments. This study suggests a theoretical framework to augment existing relationships of trust, motivation, and commitment research, emphasizing the role of institution-based trust provided by the community itself. This study also explains that online communities can sustain their competitive advantages with the community membership base by facilitating impersonal structures and functionalities of the community.	online community	Jaeki Song;Junghwan Kim;Jason Triche;Miri Kim;Sangmi Chai	2018	DATA BASE	10.1145/3242734.3242738	competitive advantage;normality;public relations;situational ethics;business;regulatory focus theory	HCI	-85.9639142189954	-5.861936670524817	21573

End-users’ reluctance or unwillingness to adopt or use the newly implemented ERP system is often cited as one of the main reasons for ERP failures. To examine factors leading to the lack of end-user acceptance of ERP systems, we reviewed the literature on user adoption of IT in mandatory contexts, developed hypotheses to explain ERP user acceptance, and conducted a survey study to test the hypotheses. In particular, we examined end-users’ attitudes toward system use and symbolic adoption, which refers to users’ voluntary mental acceptance of a system, to understand user acceptance in the ERP context. Four cognitive constructs— perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived compatibility, and perceived fit—were hypothesized as the antecedents. The research model was tested through a survey of end-users’ perceptions concerning adopting and using a newly implemented ERP system. The findings support most of our hypotheses. Specifically, perceived compatibility and perceived ease of use have both direct and indirect effects (mediated by attitude) on symbolic adoption, while perceived fit and perceived usefulness influence symbolic adoption by being fully mediated through attitude. The study provides managerial implications for organizations that are striving to engender user acceptance of newly adopted enterprise systems and applications.	erp;enterprise resource planning;enterprise system;usability	Fiona Fui-Hoon Nah;Xin Lu Tan;Soon Hing Teh	2004	IRMJ	10.4018/irmj.2004070103	public relations;enterprise system;computer science;knowledge management;database;compatibility;social psychology	HCI	-82.21615577228567	1.8255540371301315	21608

14fa89273a0b49f57c1897b13dceb824cd421036	a leader-driven open collaboration platform for exploring new domains	new domains;literature reviews;bias;coherence;leader driven open collaboration;co creation;crowdsourcing	This paper describes the design and initial evaluation of a leader-driven open collaboration platform for exploring new domains. The goal of this platform is to enable the collaboration of subject matter experts across knowledge boundaries. Traditionally, new domains are explored from within a single specialist or a focused group perspective. However, this often introduces bias. Collaboration helps reduce such bias by providing access to a broader range of information sources, increasing the chances for producing new insights in a new domain. However, it also introduces a new problem: variance between the contributions made. Variance makes it difficult to produce a coherent document. In this paper, we derive propositions about how leader-driven open collaboration is expected to help reduce bias while containing variance. We also offer an initial evaluation of these propositions based on our observations from developing an initial prototype of the open collaboration platform.	coherence (physics);collaborative software;exponent bias;open collaboration;prototype;subject matter expert turing test;subject-matter expert	Michael Weiss;Ibrahim Y.

The idea that knowledge is the main organizational resource has established itself in recent years, and knowledge has become more valuable in service organizations. Managing knowledge is therefore a central activity for organizations, and organizational structure must assist in this process. Design/methodology/approach – The research strategy used is the simple case study, applied in a large multinational company in its unit established in Brazil. Findings – The paper points out that the network structure has more flexible characteristics regarding formalization, centralization and integration. In the case study, this structure encourages the flow of knowledge through the interaction between individuals, and also across sectors of the organization, with the aid of a department coordinating the KM process, responsible for the storage...

c47cbebff18990e92607f1cabcec92a54817b2af	developing a building information modelling educational framework for the tertiary sector in new zealand		Whilst Building Information Modelling (BIM) is rapidly being acknowledged as a driver for change in the Architectural, Engineering and Construction sector across the globe, the introduction of BIM into graduate and postgraduate teaching programmes in the tertiary sector in New Zealand has been minimal to date. New Zealand has an advanced albeit small economy, and whilst BIM is being deployed increasingly with effect in industry, there is no national BIM education framework and only one tertiary sector institution offers any BIM teaching in New Zealand (NZ). This paper reviews the current approaches to incorporating BIM into degree and certificate programmes in 25 leading international universities, pedagogical approaches and BIM critical success factors. A draft of a BIM educational framework for NZ is proposed based on this review. An approach for further design, development and deployment of the framework is also offered. This paper is intended to initiate debate and to start to build consensus between the academic community and industry on a national BIM educational framework for New Zealand.	bim;building information modeling;information model;software deployment;while	Garry Miller;Shubham Sharma;Claire L Donald;Robert Amor	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-41501-2_60	building information modeling;engineering;civil engineering;mechanical engineering	SE	-72.4507868088665	-5.760584435335218	21894

Significant zero order correlations were obtained with the relationships being between higher computer self efficacy, lower computer anxiety, more positive attitudes towards the Internet and longer reported use of the Internet. Significant gender effects were found throughout, with males tending to report greater computer self efficacy, lower computer anxiety, more positive attitudes towards the Internet and longer use of the Internet than females. However, regression analysis indicted that reported Internet experience (use) was the only variable independently linked to gender. It is argued that the results tend to support the contention that the literature on attitudes and anxiety towards computers is liable to extrapolate to the Internet. In particular this may apply to the gender dimension of this literature. It is also argued that the countries of Eastern Europe may now be manifesting the gender variations in relation to technology that are found in Western Europe.	internet	Alan Durndell;Zsolt Haag	2002	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/S0747-5632(02)00006-7	attitude;psychology;social science;simulation;sex;personal experience;sociology;social psychology;regression analysis	OS	-85.91692688562668	-23.665150649705254	21920

Over the last decade, and in parallel with the decentralization and the devolution of the Belgian federal policy authority towards the various regions and communities in the country, science and technology policy have become a major component of regional policy making. In the Flemish region, there has been an increasing focus on basing the funding allocation decisions that originate from this policy decentralization on “objective, quantifiable and repeatable” decision parameters. One of the data sources and indicator bases that have received ample attention in this evolution is the use of bibliometric data and indicators. This has now led to the creation of a dedicated research and policy support staff, called “Steunpunt O&O Statistieken,” and the first time application of bibliometric data and methods to support a major inter-university funding allocation decision. In this paper, we analyze this evolution. We show how bibliometric data have for the first time been used to allocate 93 million Euro of public research money between 6 Flemish universities for the fiscal year 2003, based on Web-of-Science SCI data provided to “Steunpunt O&O Statistieken” via a license agreement with Thomson-ISI. We also discuss the limitations of the current approach that was based on inter-university publication and citation counts. We provide insights into future adaptations that might make it more representative of the total research activity at the universities involved (e.g., by including data for the humanities) and of its visibility (e.g., by including impact measures). Finally, based on our current experience and interactions with the universities involved, we speculate on the future of the specific bibliometric approach that has now been adopted. More specifically, we hypothesize that the allocation method now developed and under further improvement will become more criticized if it turns out that it (1) also starts influencing intra-university research allocation decisions and, as a consequence (2) introduces adverse publication and citation behaviors at the universities involved.	bibliometrics;interaction	Koenraad Debackere;Wolfgang Glänzel	2004	Scientometrics	10.1023/B:SCIE.0000018532.70146.02	decision-making;social science;scientific method;economics;epistemology;bibliometrics;computer science;data mining;sociology;public administration;operations research;law;economic growth	DB	-78.12198051304728	-22.732895940678002	22009

The social care sector is not yet a great user of information technology (IT) and the thinking about IS is generally less well-developed than, for instance, in the health care sector. Research in health informatics indicates that there are special problems in creating integrated solutions and achieving the uptake of systems. This project was therefore undertaken with the benefit of experience of previous projects in health and social services and in the expectation that attention to participative design and people factors would be the key determinants of success. The paper describes the outcomes and draws conclusions about the special characteristics of IS projects in social services.

The business case spans 2002 to 2011 withUMTS’ roll-out year in 2002 andWLAN’s in 2004, covering indoor hot-spot areas (stations, airports, stadiums, etc.) where demand is high. The demand for thisUMTS-WLAN roaming case is evaluated based on observations from Europe’s current mobile market and its evolution. Usage scenarios of different service packages corresponding to both residential and business markets have been taken into account. Direct investments and operational costs as well as revenue streams from traffic have been calculated. The methodology and the tool developed inACTS-TERA [1] andIST-TONIC [2] projects have been utilized for this case study. Economic conclusions have been derived, presented and discussed using key profitability factors. Profitability for all scenarios and business profiles has been calculated, presented and discussed. It includes a sensitivity analysis in order to identify the major opportunities and threats, for specific service sets as well as critical parameters and uncertainties. A wide audience from mobile operators and service providers to retail companies interested in entering the 3G market, can exploit this information.

This study focuses on the implementation of customer-based inter-organizational systems (CIOS). A model is constructed and tested, based on literature in IS implementation and organizational innovation. Data from 73 organizations who have implemented such systems are gathered through a questionnaire. Two classes of independent variables, innovation factors and support factors, are examined for their influence on ClOS implementation success. While no innovation factors emerge as important, support factors, such as customer training and top management support, are found to significantly facilitate successful implementation of such systems. Implications for research and practice are discussed.	customer relationship management;information system;organizational behavior	Varun Grover;James T. C. Teng	1994	Inf. Syst.

Methodology: This study proposes and validates a new theoretical model that extends the theory of planned behavior (TPB). Partial least squares analysis (PLS) is employed to test the research model and corresponding hypotheses on data collected from 216 survey samples. Findings: Mobility, security/privacy risk, and trust in the service provider are important factors affecting the adoption of smart home services. Practical implications: To increase potential users’ adoption rate, service providers should focus on developing mobility-related services that enable people to access smart home services while on the move using mobile devices via control and monitoring functions. Originality/Value: This study is the first empirical attempt to examine user acceptance of smart home services, as most of the prior literature has concerned technical features.	home automation;mobile device;partial least squares regression;theory	Heetae Yang;Hwansoo Lee;Hangjung Zo	2017	Industrial Management and Data Systems	10.1108/IMDS-01-2016-0017	knowledge management;marketing;services computing;computer security	HCI	-89.17396766086615	-9.63214060165938	22208

e4c0a047b387e2fae6b7bed6b1a506485abed099	analysing the history of game controversies		The aim of this paper is to discuss some of the controversies that have surrounded digital games. Within media studies, such controversies are often referred to as moral panics or media panics. They are understood as cyclical events that arise when new media or media phenomena are introduced into society. The paper’s point of departure is the controversy that erupted after the launch of Death Race in 1976, which initiated the first worldspanning debate concerning digital games and violence. Similar debates followed the launch of games like Doom and Mortal Kombat. More recent controversies about game violence have erupted specifically in the wake of school shootings. My analysis shows that, while these debates certainly share similarities, they also undergo important transformations over time. Via a historical perspective, I will demonstrate the importance of these changes to our understanding of the status of digital games in society.	death race;denial-of-service attack;doom;massively multiplayer online role-playing game;monopoly;moral hazard;mortal kombat;new media;software patent debate;t-norm	Faltin Karlsen	2014			social science;political science;sociology	HCI	-75.35041936838103	-13.476557236557412	22283
03b54be83270253b396e51cd97155bc4a2337b3e	citation impacts revisited: how novel impact measures reflect interdisciplinarity and structural change at the local and global level		"""Citation networks have fed numerous works in scientific evaluation, science mapping (and more recently largescale network studies) for decades. The variety of citation behavior across scientific fields is both a research topic in sociology of science, and a problem in scientific evaluation. Normalization, tantamount to a particular weighting of links in the citation network, is necessary for allowing across-field comparisons of citation scores and interdisciplinary studies. In addition to classical normalization which drastically reduces all variability factors altogether, two tracks of research have emerged in the recent years. One is the revival of iterative """"influence measures"""". The second is the """"citing-side"""" normalization, whose only purpose is to control for the main factor of variability, the inequality in citing propensity, letting other aspects play: knowledge export/imports and growth. When all variables are defined at the same field-level, two propositions are established: (a) the gross impact measure identifies with the product of relative growth rate, gross balance of citation exchanges, and relative number of references (b) the normalized impact identifies with the product of relative growth rate and normalized balance. At the science level, the variance of growth rate over domains is a proxy for change in the system, and the variance of balance a measure of inter-disciplinary dependences. This opens a new perspective, where the resulting variance of normalized impact, and a related measure, the sum of these variances proposed as a Change-Exchange Indicator, summarize important aspects of science structure and dynamism. Results based on a decade’s data are discussed. The behavior of normalized impact according to scale changes is also briefly discussed. A shift towards a network-based definition of domains, more in the nomenclature-free spirit of citing-side normalization than database classification schemes, appears promising, albeit with technical challenges. An appealing issue is the connection with macro-level life-cycles of domains, and the dynamics of citation network."""	citation graph;citation network;emoticon;iteration;proxy server;social inequality;spatial variability	Michel Zitt;Jean-Philippe Cointet	2013	CoRR		computer science;management science;operations research	ML	-77.54348579664489	-17.898539936755764	22311

The current study argues that this approach demands improvements for two reasons: (1) this tactic may be biased, since past studies have only examined the single trait of innovativeness and its impact on an individual adoption intention and (2) the organisational implementation intention might be more important than the individual adoption intention, but the former has been largely ignored in the existing literature. Based on the case of business intelligence (BI) systems and data from 62 senior managers, this study is a pioneer in that it empirically reveals that managers’ individual adoption intention is distinct from their organisational implementation intention. Further, while managers’ innovativeness may be a significant determinant of their individual adoption intention towards BI systems, the issue of whether managers actuall...

By examining the two jurisdictions of Hong Kong and Ontario, we argue that, in addition to institutional structures, differing cultural notions of privacy affect the acceptance of new information and communication technologies (ICTs). For our comparison, we focus on one potentially privacy-invasive technology, smart cards, and discuss the factors that contribute to their adoption and use in the two regions selected, including one’s conceptualization of digital identity and privacy, and the role of consultation and public debate.	conceptualization (information science);digital identity;privacy;smart card	Stuart G.

cdfbe3659b0c316b32ffd20cbf8b1d32f0fca525	online video services and other media: substitutes or complement	time displacement;longitudinal analysis;online video services;media displacement	As people increasingly access movies, user-created content, and linear television programs through the Internet, scholars are paying attention to the effect of online video services on various media markets, including the broadcasting market. Focusing on South Korea, this study examines how changes in the time spent on online video services affect the time spent on other media: terrestrial TV, pay TV, terrestrial DMB, radio, SNSs, games, newspapers, and books. This study also examines how this time displacement effect of online videos on other media differs across various video content categories. The results show that an increase in the time spent on online video services reduces the time spent on cable TV and games. Among the online video content categories, broadcast network programs and cable network programs reduced the time spent on cable TV, and movies reduced the time spent on games. Moreover, the amount of time spent viewing online videos reduced the time spent on non-media activities but increased sleeping time. 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	book;digital video;displacement mapping;internet;terrestrial television;user-generated content;video clip	Seung-Yeop Lee;Sang-Woo Lee	2015	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2015.03.073	simulation;computer science;multimedia	HCI	-85.62898877850033	-14.402445734249753	22412

It has been proposed that IS personnel with technical anchors have difficultly moving into a more advanced career stage that requires a greater emphasis on managerial skills (e.g., leadership) and activities. Using the data from a survey of IS professionals, we find that career satisfaction is positively and significantly correlated with career stage. Moreover, managerially anchored IS professionals are found to be more satisfied in the mentor stage than those who are technically anchored. However, no clear relationship between career anchors and career satisfaction was found in the sponsor stage. It appears that the combined effects of career anchor and stage is a more complex relation than previously thought in the literature. The results indicate that career programs discussed in the literature may need to be adjusted to accommodate advancement for those with a technical career anchor.	html element;incidence matrix;information system	Maxwell K.

Nevertheless, a significant divide persists.  How should we measure the divide? We propose two related indices, introduced in the context of health inequality by Wagstaff et al. (1991, 2005), as measures for the depth and breadth of the digital divide. We show how these quantify the contribution of the digital divide to social inequalities and cycles of deprivation. Depth measures the barriers to digital inclusion presented by existing deprivation. Breadth measures the degree to which the digital divide tends to reinforce existing inequalities.  We report briefly on two applications, one local, one global, to illustrate how these measures can be used to assess progress and inform policies intended to reduce the digital divide.	social inequality	Michael Paul Fourman	2016		10.1145/2909609.2909616	drainage divide;socioeconomics;inequality;mathematics;welfare economics	Web+IR	-78.66300220927812	-7.048873250274784	22415

An intriguing thread in this literature pertains to the influence of social networks on standards setting processes. While scholars acknowledge networks’ importance, their relevance to sponsors’ efforts to diffuse their technologies and establish them as de facto standards have been neglected. We theorize that sponsors choose alliance partners according to their location in the networks that connect potential adopters and that the network position that enhances a partner’s attractiveness depends on a technology’s stage of development. We hypothesize that sponsors of technologies that are early in their development and unproven commercially choose partners to create multiple points of contact between previous and potential adopters, called wide bridges. These redundant ties can foster the broad acceptance of a new technology that is essential to drive its diffusion. Sponsors of technologies in later stages of their development, with a commercial track record, can rely on a sparser network of ties to activate peer-to-peer diffusion. In line with our predictions, we found that during the battle to establish a 2G wireless standard in the U.S. market, Qualcomm, sponsor of the unproven CDMA (code division multiple access) technology, formed alliances that conformed to a wide-bridge pattern, while Ericsson, sponsor of the proven TDMA (time division multiple access) technology, formed alliances consistent with a peer-to-peer pattern of diffusion.	social network	Susan K.

With competition increasing worldwide, more and more organisations realise that they need to reshape their business in order to survive and prosper into the next century. In other words they need to completely reshape their organisations. Systems integration (SI) is a stepping stone for organisations to reengineer themselves. Through SI implementation, they can take advantage of technological advances, improve speed, service and quality. Despite the worthwhile goal, organisations are still hesitant on this venture. Based on a case study carried out in the University of Malaya, the paper discusses the factors that push an organisation to seriously consider SI as an enabling tool for continued success in the future. We then highlight some direct advantages that can be derived from SI and how they can overcome some of the IT concerns of an organisation. Next we discuss briefly the drawbacks of SI and how they can be overcome or minimised. Finally, we mention some supportive points that further encourage the implementation of SI.	information system	Abu Bakar Zaitun;Mashkuri Yaacob	1996		10.1109/ISCNZ.1996.555299	systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;management	NLP	-74.72702216430956	3.9732163206424147	22545

An organization’s ability to remember and learn from its past, in other words, its ability to use its “organizational memory” has been around for centuries as a means of learning, exchanging and accumulating knowledge to help the organization realize its objectives. Organizational memories are generated and used in communities of practice with little, if any, explicit effort devoted to their development. Information technology offers the promise of helping to build and use such organizational memories. For the most part, however, this promise is unrealized. In this paper, we explore why this is so and consider the challenges to developing and maintaining organizational memories.	computer memory	Michael E.

The natural implication of this assumption is that trained users would differ markedly from non-trained users. Yet in exploratory survey research conducted in a large Southern California company, trained and non-trained microcomputer users did not differ along most work-related dimensions. Instead, where trained and non-trained users varied at all in their work habits and in their attitudes toward micros and training, the variation seemed more related to their desire for training, rather than to the training itself. The authors discuss the findings from this study and propose future research in the area of corporate-provided microcomputer training.	microcomputer	Joey F. George;James W.

Examining the characteristics of the service technologies and related industries, this study focuses on the structure, participants and roles of standardisation of the layers within the emerging mobile remote physiological monitoring industry. The study concludes that the structure of the emerging mobile remote physiological monitoring industry will be oriented about service provision, be integrated with other personal / patient data storage services and be heavily influenced by the interplay of technological developments, the health market structure, existing players and regulation. Additionally, the keys players are likely to be the system integrators and service providers concentrating on large institutional customers. A focus of the paper is analysing both the causes and implications of a modular, horizontally layered industry structure likely to result from the mix of technologies, suppliers and customers as this market develops. The paper discusses why, although horizontal specialisation is the most likely outcome, there is little risk of key layers becoming commoditised.

Three gains are seen to accrue from this approach: greater clarity about the material properties of technology; links to broader structural conditions arising from the conceptualization of the relationship between agency and structure; and the potential to explore the importance of reflexivity in contemporary organizations, especially in conditions of the widespread use of ICT. The importance of disaggregating ICT artifacts into levels and features is stressed, in order to enable analysis to explore the specific impacts of particular combinations. This is developed through a discussion of data warehousing in connection with the attention being given to the importance of analytics in organizational strategies. Key features are located in wider aspects of the cultural and structural context, demonstrating the fruitfulness of a morphogenetic approach.	conceptualization (information science)	Alistair Mutch	2010	Organization Science	10.1287/orsc.1090.0441	psychology;structure and agency;social science;reflexivity;computer science;knowledge management;critical realism;management science;sociology;management;operations research;information technology;information system	Comp.	-78.05950226795343	-2.210046127462396	22670

Research suggests that CMC may impose a disadvantage to females, demonstrating lower levels of social presence. This study assesses the predictive relationship between gender and online social presence. A total of 395 graduate students participated by responding to the Computer-Mediated Communication Questionnaire. Quantitative research designs and analyses were applied. This study concluded that online social presence is not related to gender; therefore, gender cannot serve as an effective predictor for online social presence. A femaleâ€™s online social presence can be as high as a maleâ€™s. Effective strategies to improve online social presence for both genders are suggested. Additionally, this study raises the importance on gender equity in emerging social media.	social presence theory	Chih-Hsiung Tu;Cherng-Jyh Yen;Michael Blocher	2011	IJOPCD	10.4018/ijopcd.2011070103	psychology;public relations;social competence;multimedia;social psychology	HCI	-86.80284712085908	-21.7784945164072	22675

The results are compared with previous research that covered the data only from the Social Science Citation Index (SSCI). The analysis reveals that there is no distinct difference between these two sets of results. The results of current study show that IR speciality is multi-disciplinary with broad relations with other specialities. The field of IR is a mature field, as the journals used for research communication remained quite stable during the study period.	citation analysis;co-citation;file spanning;information retrieval;information science;journal citation reports;library (computing);social sciences citation index	Ying Ding;Gobinda G.

We conducted topic modeling analysis to gain a longitudinal view of the interaction of societal, personal and revolutionary blog topics over this period. Furthermore, a qualitative analysis of blog posts during the period that bracketed the political uprising revealed Egyptian bloggers' concerns. Reporting events and supplying commentary provided bloggers with a means to voice dissent against institutionalized power represented by the government-controlled media. In short, blogs reveal a counter-narrative to the government-supplied version of events in Egypt during the 18-day uprising. These narratives offer rich documentation of how blogs, and perhaps social media more generally, can be utilized by individuals operating under repressive conditions.	blog;blogosphere;documentation;social media;topic model	Ban Al-Ani;Gloria Mark;Justin Chung;Jennifer Jones	2012		10.1145/2145204.2145213	social science;social media;computer science;qualitative research;topic model;communication;empirical research;management;social psychology;world wide web	HCI	-81.70970644543722	-16.952427374351494	22692

Yet, despite an increasingly cyber-dependent world and visible progress on the Alliance’s civilian side, NATO has had no visible track record on how this change in the way the world does business has had an impact on its key military structure and enabler for collective defence - the NATO Command Structure (NCS). At their July 2016 Summit in Warsaw the NATO Heads of State and Government declared cyber to become an operational domain for the Alliance. The paper argues that in order to cope with the new situation and to deliver on the commitment NATO needs to consider establishing a Cyber Command within the NCS. This is a matter of urgency especially as within the new domain the Alliance will need to face an increasingly challenging cyber threat landscape. In addition, it will also need to live up to its current Strategic Concept by addressing all the three core areas – collective defence, crisis management and cooperative security – in cyber. Last but not least, it would play an increasing role for the Alliance in terms of its deterrence posture.	network computing system;poor posture	Siim Alatalu	2016	2016 International Conference on Cyber Conflict (CyCon U.S.)	10.1109/CYCONUS.2016.7836609	simulation;engineering;operations research;computer security	SE	-73.2779342590515	-9.612406588876206	22700

We focus especially on the way in which voting technology experiences that voters have had affect their confidence in the voting process, their attitudes toward fraud and reform, and other aspects of the voting process. We find that voters are sensitive to the voting mode they use—in person voting compared to absentee voting—as well as to whether they get to vote on the technology they prefer (paper versus electronic). Finally, the privacy that voters feel in the voting process is also important in shaping the voter’s confidence.	noise shaping;privacy	Charles Stewart;R. Michael Alvarez;Thad E.

The purpose of this study is to undertake a comprehensive review of the literature related to e-government satisfaction and adoption with a particular focus on the most critical factors and their manifested variables that influence user satisfaction in e-government. Usable data relating to e-government research were collected from 147 papers identified from the Scopus database and by manually identifying relevant articles from journals dedicated to e-government research such as Electronic Government, an International Journal (EGIJ), International Journal of Electronic Government Research (IJEGR) and Transforming Government: People, Process, and Policy (TGPPP). A meta-analysis of existing e-government studies found that the majority of the construct relationships demonstrated a significant range of average summative correlation, and effect size, but the influence of perceived ease of use, effort expectancy on behavioural intention, behavioural intention on use behaviour, and perceived trust on risk were still found to be non-significant. A broader analysis of e-government satisfaction and adoption research seems to reflect that although a large number of theories and theoretical constructs were borrowed from reference disciplines such as Information Systems, e-commerce and public administration, their utilisation by e-government researchers appears to be largely random in approach.

013e69804cbc5b3a628e4fcab25d3ba66dcd4b59	to open or not to open? determinants of open government data	open government;information sharing;open data;government information	In recent years, open government data has become an important movement among government administrations around the world. While there is still limited open data research conducted in East Asia, this study explores the complexity of open data initiatives in Taiwan. In particular, the influential factors and their impacts on open data initiatives are investigated from four perspectives: technology, organization, legislation and policy, and environment. Legislation and policy is found to have the most significant impact while agencies’ existing regulations and policies act as constraints. The factors residing in organizational and environmental perspectives follow as the secondary impacts. Technological factors also exist but are considered to be relatively more easily resolved with sufficient support. While the identified factors act as determinants to influence government agencies’ intentions towards open data participation, it is also found that open data is closely related to interagency information sharing, and the two activities in the long term are expected to reinforce to each other iteratively. In addition, practical implications are discussed to provide practitioners with insights. Lastly, the contributions, limitations and potential future research of the current study are listed in the Conclusion section.	complexity;constraint (mathematics);e-governance;external validity;information science;iteration;linked data;national supercomputer centre in sweden;section 508 amendment to the rehabilitation act of 1973;semiconductor industry	Tung-Mou Yang;Jin Lo;Jing Shiang	2015	J.

This research uses narrative method to obtain stories from a number of such knowledge workers in New Zealand, and observes how the participants make sense of the choices open to them, and reach decisions about them The research finds that despite expressed resentments, such people have tended to move the equilibrium in ways that accommodate more work. Implications of this research are that despite the short term productivity gains, organizations would do well to ensure that these well motivated staff are managed for their long term well being and continued contribution to the organization. .	24-hour clock;anytime algorithm;autonomous robot;bureaucracy;centralized computing;closing (morphology);consciousness;email;emergence;information systems;information access;information security;sensemaking	Brian M.

This hierarchy is part of the canon of information science and management. The paper considers whether the hierarchy, also known as the ‘Knowledge Hierarchy’, is a useful and intellectually desirable construct to introduce, whether the views expressed about DIKW are true and have evidence in favour of them, and whether there are good reasons offered or sound assumptions made about DIKW. Arguments are offered that the hierarchy is unsound and methodologically undesirable. The paper identifies a central logical error that DIKW makes. The paper identifies the dated and unsatisfactory philosophical positions of operationalism and inductivism as the philosophical backdrop to the hierarchy. The paper concludes with a sketch of some positive theories, of value to information science, on the nature of the components of the hierarchy: that data is anything recordable in a semantically and pragmatically sound way, that information is what is known in other literature as ‘weak knowledge’, that knowledge also is ‘weak knowledge’ and that wisdom is the possession and use, if required, of wide practical knowledge, by an agent who appreciates the fallible nature of that knowledge.	backdrop cms;dikw pyramid;information science;intellect;theory	Martin Frické	2009	J.

That happens because in various political and economic situations all-level governments of various countries are unable to make decisions based solely on one-sided and isolated information: to do so may be very complicated. As known, changes or crisis situations in the society or in the world cannot depend only on a single or a small amount of variability; they are all results of participating variability in function. The city of Quanzhou in Fujian Province of China is not only developing well in the sphere of the economy but also in that of E-government. In order to impel its economic development and attain a higher goal, this research suggests that the government of Quanzhou should unify the network platform, seek unity of standards, pool fund, share information, increase service items and build up one effective and integrated E-government system as soon as possible.	e-government;heart rate variability;spatial variability	Zhonghui Ouyang	2005		10.1145/1089551.1089642	geography;economy;economic growth	AI	-76.37171418391382	-9.673185832530306	22840

A valuable new perspective emerges when GIS are considered as a means for enhancing organizational learning (OL). OL refers to the learning activities of individuals and groups within an organization, especially with respect to the competitive environment, the state of the organizational system and the products and processes of the organization. GIS can in uence the way in which OL occurs. GIS can also aŒect to what extent OL occurs. A model is developed to assess the value of GIS for OL.

The alignment involves an entire organisation. However, much of the research has focused on the factors affecting alignment at the senior executive level, and there appears to be less attention placed upon factors that affect the lower operational levels. This article attempts to address this gap in the literature through a case study of a healthcare organisation. Semi-structured interviews with ten employees at an operational level were qualitatively analysed to elucidate factors. Organisational culture, management expectations, communication, and the provision and recognition of skills were identified as main factors that may affect the alignment of business and IT strategies at the lower levels		Sid Vatharkar;Ping Gao;Vladislav Fomin	2018	IJHISI	10.4018/IJHISI.2018070103	organizational culture;knowledge management;health care;information technology;medicine	HCI	-80.94613232172662	1.5846471681783614	22948

Observing that many states are implementing more and more aggressive cyber strategy, an examination of applicable law regulating cyber warfare becomes crucially important. This paper attempts to review the traditional norms of jus in bello and explore their defects in the context of cyber space. Accordingly, in the fist part the author provides the brief introduction of conventional jus in bello and its application in kinetic warfare. Further, the second part explains some special natures of the use of cyber tools in warfare and the third part analyzes the problems of applying the traditional jus in bello in cyber space. Last but not least, the final part gives some conclusive remarks and points out the solutions would be to initiate more international co-operation.

While organisations adopt Cloud Computing for Web Services, technical and business challenges emerge and one of these includes the measurement of Cloud business performance. Organisational Sustainability Modelling (OSM) is a new way to measure Cloud business performance quantitatively and accurately. It combines statistical computation and 3D Visualisation to present the Return on Investment arising from the adoption of Cloud Computing by organisations. 3D visualisation simplifies the review process and is an innovative way for Return of Investment (ROI) valuation. Two detailed case studies with SAP and Vodafone have been presented, where OSM has analysed the business performance and explained how CCBF offers insights, which are relatively helpful for WS and Grid businesses. Comparisons and discussions between CCBF and other approaches related to WS are presented, where lessons learned are useful for Web Services, Cloud and Grid communities.	cloud computing;computation;grid computing;openstreetmap;region of interest;software deployment;value (ethics);visualization (graphics);web service	Victor I.

In this exploratory study, we consider the feasibility of using the Web as a data collection medium in China, which has a current Internet population of 103 million. Following a review of the literature regarding the design, implementation, and application of Web surveys, and the current state of data collection in developing countries in general and China in particular, we describe how we developed a Web-based survey instrument focusing on the ethical values of IT professionals. We e-mailed 5,000 IT professionals in China, inviting them to participate in the survey. Thirty-seven percent of those contacted visited the Web site and 5.8% submitted the survey. The survey data, both qualitative and quantitative, is analysed and discussed with a view to drawing up instructive guidance for researchers interested to use the Web as a data collection tool in China, as well as developing countries more generally. The Web-based survey has great potential in these contexts, if sensitively designed and implemented. We consider the implications of this research and identify areas where future research is necessary.	email;value (ethics);world wide web	Robert M. Davison;Yuan Li;Carol S. P.

e0d53ba0defc32c508f458d77c5b9ef9885568a0	mediators of rfid implementation in the public/private sector context: an ant perspective	rfid	The majority of studies into Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) based systems focus on the technical and engineering aspects of such systems. Where research expands outside this scope, it tends to focus on single supply chains set either within the private sector, or less commonly the public sector. This research examines RFID based systems, asking the question “what factors or issues mediate the relationship between public and private sector where they are involved in an RFID system?” From an Actor Network Theory (ANT) perspective, in depth interviews were conducted with 38 senior managers in four countries in order to understand the cross-sector implementations in which they were involved. Eleven mediators were found, across three dimensions. Overarching systems mediators were financial, infrastructure, standards, organisational knowledge and security. Inter-organisational mediators were trust, privacy and legislation. Intra-organisational mediators were leadership, data management and benefits. Some differences were also seen in the way the two sectors acted. This research contributes to theory by proposing a model demonstrating the mediators involved in cross-sector implementations. The novel use of ANT also suggests a research approach that may be successful in further understanding complex technology systems.	computational trust;computer security;network theory;privacy;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification	Marta Vos;Rowena Cullen;Jocelyn Cranefield	2013			marketing;ant;private sector;computer science;public relations	Security	-81.56193979103168	-1.7278522088041672	23054

Data from 2006 and 2009 are used to compare the formal features of the sites, mainly domain names, hyperlinks and type of news stories presented on the sites. The empirical analysis uncovers a rough typology of international broadcasters in the Middle East. The first category refers to international broadcasters that position their institutions as alternative media voices in the targeted regional media market. The second category of international broadcasters perceives their role as information sources about their sponsoring states, functioning like a “tourist” pamphlet. The study charts future research prospects on international broadcasting in the age of the Internet, how these efforts could be harvested in public diplomacy enterprises.

The viewpoint can be summarized in two points. First, over the last 50 years or so—but especially in the last 20 years—the vast information stores in government agencies 1 have moved from being generally inaccessible to the public to now being available at anyone’s desktop. Some government information remains restricted from any public access; other government information is thrust into the hands, eyes, and ears of members of the public in a manner so that access is virtually impossible to avoid. Second, in recent years, a growing countertrend stands in tension with the movement toward universal accessibility to government information. The countertrend arises from increasing societal concern with personal privacy, consumer protection, and the security of information. Table 1 encapsulates these two points and this viewpoint.	accessibility;desktop computer;hypertext transfer protocol;internet access;openness;p3p;privacy;social security;thrust	J.

We develop the idea that team creativity results primarily from integration of individually held expertise of team members at the team level. We further propose the quality of intrateam relationships and knowledge complementarities that align the work of individual team members at the project level influence creativity primarily through the process of expertise integration. We use data from a field study of 142 participants in 42 ISD projects to test the proposed model. The paper makes three new contributions to the IS literature. Its key contribution lies in developing an expertise integration view of team creativity. We demonstrate the centrality of integrating individually held tacit and explicit knowledge about the problem domain and the technology at the team level in achieving team creativity. The use of a process-focused conceptualization of team creativity is especially noteworthy here. 01 tiwana.pmd 6/15/2005, 11:21 PM 13 14 AMRIT TIWANA AND EPHRAIM R. MCLEAN The second contribution of the paper lies in conceptually developing and operationalizing the concept of expertise integration, a mechanism by which individually held knowledge is integratively applied at the project level. Although the importance of knowledge in the ISD process is widely recognized in prior research, this is the first study to develop the concept in a operationally meaningful way. The third key contribution lies in showing that the compositional and relational attributes of ISD project teams—diverse specialized knowledge in a team, the quality of intrateam working relationships, and members’ cross-domain absorptive capacity—do not engender creativity by themselves; they do so primarily because they enhance integration of individual knowledge at the project level. We offer empirical evidence for such full mediation. These findings have important theoretical and practical implications, which are discussed in the paper.	align (company);centrality;conceptualization (information science);field research;information system;problem domain;software development process	Amrit Tiwana;Ephraim R.

In this research, we use the concept of social network analysis to investigate the effect of interaction inside a group. The proposed approach analyzes a pair of adjectives in terms of personalities, a concept that can be extended to investigate the similarities of group members. This research samples 8 groups and finds that: (1) “openness to experience” is the indicator for the natural formation of a group, (2) “conscientiousness” is the indicator for the formation of a group by a task, especially in a highly task-oriented environment, and (3) couples only have parts of similarity among five factors. The study provides direction for future research into similarity of group members.	openness;sql;social network analysis	Wei-Lun Chang;Sian-Ting Lin	2009	2009 International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering	10.1109/CSE.2009.165	organization;knowledge management	DB	-90.08786821340992	-1.010912385448158	23185

This is done through a series of example documents of various kinds, such as founding charters, peer handbooks and ethical codes systematically analysed through the use of document theory and theory on institutional change.rnrnrnrnrnFindingsrnrnrnrnrnThe findings of this study suggest that documents pronouncing ethical self-regulation within librarianship play a primarily legitimising role in situations where new types of libraries emerge or when libraries adapt to social change. The study proposes legitimacy as a key aspect of documentality, thus supplementing the established understanding of the concept.rnrnrnrnrnOriginality/valuernrnrnrnrnThis study is the first to analyse the role of ethical codes in libraries using document theory. It brings new knowledge to the role of ethical self-regulation in librarianship over time and in different institutional contexts. In suggesting a developed definition of documentality, it contributes to the theoretical understanding of the role of documents and documentation in institutions and in society at large.	librarian	Joacim Hansson	2017	Journal of Documentation	10.1108/JD-02-2017-0022	library science;library management;ethical code;documentation;professional ethics;originality;documentality;institutional theory;social change;knowledge management;sociology	Logic	-73.96674688932058	-20.465144945737563	23203

We are especially interested to find relations between adverse drug reactions and other words in co-word-matrices from a medical field. Second we want to explore whether the relations between adverse drug reactions and other words have changed in subsequent time periods. The results show that INDSCAL can be a useful tool for mapping dynamics.	image scaling;multidimensional scaling	Floor Rikken;Henk A. L.

ab6f3f866641dbf90a932414ce3e1267672ce7b2	misinformation spreading on facebook		Social media are pervaded by unsubstantiated or untruthful rumors, that contribute to the alarming phenomenon of misinformation. The widespread presence of a heterogeneous mass of information sources may affect the mechanisms behind the formation of public opinion. Such a scenario is a florid environment for digital wildfires when combined with functional illiteracy, information overload, and confirmation bias. In this essay, we focus on a collection of works aiming at providing quantitative evidence about the cognitive determinants behind misinformation and rumor spreading. We account for users’ behavior with respect to two distinct narratives: a) conspiracy and b) scientific information sources. In particular, we analyze Facebook data on a time span of five years in both the Italian and the US context, and measure users’ response to i) information consistent with one’s narrative, ii) troll contents, and iii) dissenting information e.g., debunking attempts. Our findings suggest that users tend to a) join polarized communities sharing a common narrative (echo chambers), b) acquire information confirming their beliefs (confirmation bias) even if containing false claims, and c) ignore dissenting information.	approximation algorithm;conformity;emergence;emoticon;global cascades model;information overload;information source;interaction;polarization (waves);rumor spread in social network;social dynamics;social media	Fabiana Zollo;Walter Quattrociocchi	2017	CoRR		computer science;rumor;functional illiteracy;dissenting opinion;misinformation;confirmation bias;social media;social psychology;information overload;phenomenon	NLP	-83.87025892845357	-17.34080697796033	23235
16d84aaa7b43e41881e00c143cbac08f8a19bd85	an explanation of resisted discoveries based on construal-level theory	scientific resistance;construal-level theory;suitable scope;examined scope;direct evidence	New discoveries and theories are crucial for the development of science, but they are often initially resisted by the scientific community. This paper analyses resistance to scientific discoveries that supplement previous research results or conclusions with new phenomena, such as long chains in macromolecules, Alfvén waves, parity nonconservation in weak interactions and quasicrystals. Construal-level theory is used to explain that the probability of new discoveries may be underestimated because of psychological distance. Thus, the insufficiently examined scope of an accepted theory may lead to overstating the suitable scope and underestimating the probability of its undiscovered counter-examples. Therefore, psychological activity can result in people instinctively resisting new discoveries. Direct evidence can help people judge the validity of a hypothesis with rational thinking. The effects of authorities and textbooks on the resistance to discoveries are also discussed. From the results of our analysis, suggestions are provided to reduce resistance to real discoveries, which will benefit the development of science.

Design/methodology/approach – An extensive literature review combined with an in-depth case study analysis identified a range of potential transfer barriers. These in turn were examined in terms of their consistency of impact by an end-to-end process survey conducted within an IBM facility. Findings – Barrier impact cannot be assumed to be uniform across the core processes of the organization. Process performance will be impacted upon in different ways and subject to varying degrees of influence by the transfer barriers. Barrier identification and management must take place at a process rather than at the organizational level. Research limitations/implications – The findings are based, in the main, on an extensive single company study. Although significant in terms of influencing both knowledge and information systems design and management the study/findings have still to be fully replicated across a range of public and private organizations. Originality/value – The deployment of generic information technology and business systems needs to be questioned if they have been designed and implemented to satisfy organizational rather than process needs.	end-to-end principle;information system;software deployment;systems design	Stephen McLaughlin;Robert A.

In combination with the bystander effect, help might not be provided in the case of an emergency. This paper suggests the framework of a Community Watch Service. The conceptional architecture enables citizens to join virtual, territorial communities. Citizens can create their own virtual territories. These territories are linked to software services offering functionality like reporting damage to public property, receiving information from public authorities or organizing help in the neighborhood. The framework aims to improve social control in a positive way and increase public safety in large cities. We demonstrate the Community Watch Service as a prototype which is available for standard web browsers and Android-based mobile phones.	android;mobile phone;organizing (structure);prototype	Martin Steinhauser;Andreas C.

In this paper, we focus on a system - ZorgDomein - that was developed to optimize GP-medical specialist communication. Contrary to the notion of 'shared' or 'integrated care' that often assumes a 'seamless' health care, we will focus on the negotiated order of GP-specialist cooperation, showing the precarious localized arrangements that allow both a bridging and a separation of professional activities concerning patient care. Furthermore, we analyze how ZorgDomein changes the arrangements to maintain a working order. The main focus of the article is on the way GP-specialist referrals are on the one hand conceptualized as discrete events of information sharing, while on the other hand are part of a process of care. We will argue that in standardization attempts by national and local actors, embodied within the technology, information exchange between first and secondary care is made into a product. This conceptualization and materialization neglects the process in which this information comes about or is being created. We discuss the consequences of this for the design and use of the technology.	bridging (networking);conceptualization (information science);delivery of health care;information sciences;information exchange;inter-process communication;optimizing compiler;patient referral;seamless3d;secondary care	Roland Bal;Femke Mastboom;Han Paul Spiers;Harm J T Rutten	2007	International journal of medical informatics	10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2006.05.033	information exchange;medicine;knowledge management;nursing;organizational communication;management;health care	HCI	-75.50603587943714	-4.08280340639502	23355
ea1f50365f417fc1a4a1d36392de511733824a1f	the effect of edi on market channel relationships in retailing	marketing channel	Many of the economic advantages of using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) result from improved relationships between business trading partners. This study develops and tests a model explaining the effects of EDI on three structural variables of inter-organizational relationships: channel intensity, formalization and information quality. The model also includes the effects of these structural variables on cooperation and conflict between trading partners, and on satisfaction and performance in a marketing channel. The model is based on Van de Ven and Ferry's theory of inter-organizational relations and the literature on marketing channels. Responses from 97 retail companies to a mail survey indicated support for the effects of EDI use on channel intensity and formalization but not on channel information quality. Moreover, intensity and formalization were positively related to channel cooperation but not to conflict. Channel performance was positively related to channel cooperation and negatively related to channel conflict. These findings suggest that EDI use improves cooperation between trading partners and leads to greater satisfaction and performance in electronically-mediated business transactions. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.	edi;electronic data interchange;information quality;ven (currency)	Leo R.

CRMs like resveratrol, metformin and rapamycin have been extensively tested in animals and have undergone clinical trials in humans, with positive indications for extended lifespan. This raises important questions for individuals and society: Is it really better to have a longer life? Would life-extending biotechnologies contribute to social problems like overpopulation? Will CRMs increase the longevity gap between haves and havenots? Worryingly, many of these concerns are neglected, both in individual choices and in social policy. The imminent availability of interventions that substantially increase lifespan creates an urgent need for informed individual and policy decisions. As a step in this direction I focus on whether life extension by CRMs would make a person's life better. One of the greatest fears in this regard is that lifespan augmenting technologies would result in a prolonged old age, and an extended period spent in intolerably poor health. On the basis of empirical studies, I claim that CRMs will not result in worse health than is normally the case in old age. However, since they slow down the ageing process they will extend the period in which one is more susceptible to the diseases of old age. Though preferable to substantially worse health, prolonged old age may seem undesirable to some. I make the case that CRMs would most likely improve one's quality of life. This is because they would add to life's value by increasing the number of years spent in good health. Moreover, I argue that even years spent in worse health, above a certain level, can contribute to the goodness of life. These considerations mean that this emerging biotechnology is likely to increase both the quantity and quality of life, and should provide part of the basis for informed decisions about the individual consequences of extending lifespan using CRMs.		Christopher Wareham	2012		10.1145/2331714.2331728	psychology;gerontology;socioeconomics;social psychology	HCI	-81.96753835337952	-6.985119379596613	23425
d9f04488c1efb9711b9a6d7e6d36da2539e9d042	the role of social media in artisanal production: a case of craft beer		We present craft beer as part of an artisan industry case study that demonstrates how the use of social media creates a community narrative that engages both producer and consumer around the artisanal produce and its values. In contrast to mass drinks production, the past decade has seen a resurgence in specialist artisan 'craft beer' producers, making niche, high-quality products. Specifically, we examine the craft beer industry's use of digital technologies as a way of engendering bilateral consumer engagement with their products, and how it can influence brewing practices and support in-the-field quality control. A qualitative approach, using grounded theory, was undertaken to understand the digital relationships between key stakeholders in the craft beer community, including craft brewers, retailers, bloggers, and fans, through a series of interviews, ethnographies, focus groups, and public events. Our analysis reveals future design considerations for these stakeholders, with findings supporting the design of future interactions that can further strengthen the relationship between small, artisan industries and their consumers.

This paper signals the use of Beer’s viable system framework to facilitate comparison of the nature and functioning of corporate boards with the functioning of governing boards of major sporting organisation. The comparative analysis links the literature on corporate governance to specific case studies of bodies drawn from individual and pan-sport organisations. The analysis highlights similarities and differences between the functioning of governance systems in business and the world of sport. Guided by Beer’s framework, conclusions are drawn linking organisational design to aspects of organisational effectiveness and systemic organisational functioning. As such, the author not only demonstrates the diagnostic value of Beer’s notion of systemic functioning, and Beer’s framework, as management tools in the evaluation of organisational design and effectiveness, but also makes evident the necessary meta-systemic nature of effective governance.	corporate governance;qualitative comparative analysis	John Davies	2000			business sector;knowledge management;stakeholder;project governance;systems thinking;business;corporate governance	Metrics	-79.71378950420248	-1.4353445548969261	23550

It is argued that privacy is a moral right, and while such surveillance and monitoring can be justified in some circumstances, there is a presumption against the infringement of privacy. An account of privacy precedes consideration of various arguments frequently given for the surveillance and monitoring of employees, arguments which look at the benefits, or supposed benefits, to employees as well as to employers. The paper examines the general monitoring of work, and the monitoring of email, listservers and the World Wide Web. It is argued that many of the common justifications given for this surveillance and monitoring do not stand up to close scrutiny.	email;internet;privacy;world wide web	Seumas Miller;John Weckert	1999			public relations;privacy software;the internet;internet research;economics;information privacy;web accessibility initiative;sociology;internet presence management;internet privacy;web intelligence	AI	-73.46086321528145	-11.929086401679236	23552

However, users in the developing world have complained of websites blocking their countries. We explore this phenomenon using a measurement study. With a combination of automated page loads, manual checking, and traceroutes, we can say, with high confidence, that some websites do block users from some regions. We cannot say, with high confidence, why, or even based on what criteria, they do so except for in some cases where the website states a reason. We do report qualitative evidence that fears of abuse and the costs of serving requests to some regions may play a role.	blocking (computing);server-side	Sadia Afroz;Michael Carl Tschantz;Shaarif Sajid;Shoaib Asif Qazi;Mobin Javed;Vern Paxson	2018	CoRR		server-side;computer network;the internet;internet privacy;computer science;developing country;phenomenon	Metrics	-90.08155701777376	-17.069043156888565	23563

To date related research has mainly focused on the social impact of social media. However, little is known about the circumstances under which employees will invest time in using social media, especially the perceived benefits and its barriers within enterprises need further research. Different aspects of organizational knowledge management bring along different requirements for social-media-based solutions. This chapter focusses on providing both a theoretical background on social media acceptance and concepts, as well as empirical findings from practice and research investigating acceptance-relevant needs and demands of social media users in different contexts. Findings from practice corroborate that the complexity of the plethora of communication paths can be supported by social media. Findings from research reveal that regarding the users’ (emotive) needs is critical when dealing with sensitive communication/data. Combining both practice and research tries to bridge the knowledge gap existing in fast paced developments like social media.	requirement;social media	André Calero Valdez;Anne Kathrin Schaar;Jens Bender;Susanne Aghassi;Günther Schuh;Martina Ziefle	2016		10.1007/978-3-662-47827-1_7	library science;public relations;knowledge management;political science	Robotics	-77.18592888146918	-0.9783797867790484	23668

The growing popularity of WKCs and their fast penetration into almost all aspects of life call for more research on this important area. In this study, we explore and examine success factors of WKCs. To accomplish this research objective, we conducted a qualitative study to uncover a list of success factors that would affect the success of WKCs. Through open and axial data coding techniques using a grounded theory approach, we identified four main success factors: information quality, system quality, community governance, and pro-sharing norms. We further categorized dimensions of information quality, system quality, and community governance. Based on the results, we proposed a conceptual framework to examine WKC success.

This supposedly transformed government is more responsive to the needs of citizens and businesses, more efficient, more transparent and participatory. The questions that arise then are what is the implementation pace of e-government initiatives around the world and how can the real needs of citizens be met. The UN Global E-Government Readiness Report, 2008, seeks to provide answers to these questions by quantitatively assessing the strengths and weaknesses in e-government initiatives worldwide. The 2008 Report deals with these issues from the perspective of leveraging the knowledge of public organizations, since knowledge management has the potential to improve the electronic provision of services.  In their effort to provide public value to citizens, governments throughout the world face a number of challenges. Such challenges range from thoughtful IT planning, providing finance and adequate physical infrastructures in a rapidly changing technological environment, confronting problems related to existing IT infrastructure, reducing the operational cost structure of services that they provide, retaining and retraining staff, leadership and other human resources issues, data mining issues and providing for the adequate protection of data, and security and privacy issues. E-government provides a vision and a strategy for addressing these challenges and for creating an environment for the transformation of government activities by applying ebusiness methods on the public sector.	data mining;e-government;electronic business;knowledge management;privacy	Guido Bertucci	2007		10.1145/1328057.1328061	public relations;knowledge management;environmental resource management;business	HCI	-76.32134254719026	-5.175458177911614	23784

However, its techniques must be adapted to newer resources and environments. Particularly, cartography is a science that has suffered from so many abrupt changes in the last 15 years. We have passed from an enclosed and convergent dynamic characterised by classical cartography, as well as the specialisation in instruments and methods, to a divergent dynamic based on 3D cartography and marked by the flexibility in instruments, new technologies, methodologies and relation with affine disciplines. Nevertheless, 3D cartography continues to rely on a strong hardware and software dependence. In fact, some companies have invested heavily on digital implementations for 3D cartographic approaches, and lead the market in order to obtain massive cartographic data production. Consequently, prices remained high and the access to cartographic equipment continues being limited only to those who can afford it.	cartography	Diego González-Aguilera;Javier Gomez Lahoz	2008	BJET	10.1111/j.1467-8535.2007.00786.x	psychology;computer science;knowledge management;social software engineering;educational software	Graphics	-74.27803549746532	-2.43313410084079	24054

Among other empirical findings, this work demonstrates hashtags being used in diverse ways--e.g. to mark participation, assert individual identity, promote group identity, and support or challenge a frame. Considered from a networked gatekeeping perspective, we illustrate how hashtags can serve as channeling mechanisms, shaping trajectories of information flow.

b3ef9ee4f4eed761ab7b00e878b6119aa4c4b102	associations between game use and cognitive empathy: a cross-generational study		Adolescence is a sensitive period of time for developing social abilities such as cognitive empathy. Thus, social experiences in this time period are more influential in forming the social abilities than during other periods in life. Video games are agent-based media in which game players carry out their own action in a mediated world whose rules are predefined by algorithms. This means that game players do not have to engage their cognitive empathy when playing games. Thus, prolonged use of video games during adolescence can result in the underdevelopment of cognitive empathy. This survey from three age groups (adolescents aged 16-19, adults aged 37-41, elders aged 58-62) demonstrated that only among adolescents was the amount of time spent in game play negatively associated with cognitive empathy. The findings of this study can contribute to understanding the nature of video game play and its negative effects by focusing on the manner of media use rather than the messages in media, and focusing on cognitive empathy, which has rarely been examined.

(contemporary studies in information management, policy, and services). $78.50 (cloth) isbn 156750339x	information system	The Information Systems of International Inter-Governmental Organizations: A Reference Guide is a recent addition to the Contemporary Studies in Information Management, Policy, and Services series edited by Peter Hernon. This unique text defines and gives background information on inter-governmental organizations, “organizations established by three or more national governments to address a common problem and operating from an established headquarters or secretariat,” organizes them into three parts by type and lists for each key sources of information or “information systems” as the author prefers. Williams defines an information system as “any activity within an inter-governmental organization (IGO) that results in information that is used by the organization itself or intended for use the general public or specialists” (monographs, pamphlets, serials, internal data files, libraries, electronic databases, Web pages, etc.). Archival material is also mentioned if available. Information Systems is therefore an excellent reference tool to locate and define the scope of these organizations and to identify their research and publications. Internet addresses are included. In his introduction, the author explains that this guide includes only independent or autonomous IGOs and some were not included for reasons such as inactivity. Part I discusses United Nations and UN-Subsidiary Bodies while Part II covers UNSpecialized Agencies, the IAEA and Related Organizations (including introductory descriptions of these agencies) and Part III covers All Other Inter-Governmental Organizations. Each IGO entry includes brief, basic information (name, address, history and purpose). Williams suggests the Yearbook of International Organizations for more detail. The information system information for each organization includes an overview of its information systems, Internet access, major libraries and documentation centers, bibliographic guides, bibliographies and sales catalogs, periodicals and newsletters, statistical publications and databases. Also included is how to acquire an organization’s publications and documents, whether there is a depository program for the materials, and where publications are indexed. Two appendices are provided. Appendix I lists Internet Addresses for IGOs and is useful for quickly finding a URL without needing to locate the organization in the main text. Appendix II gives the background information on IGOs and also suggestions for acquiring Government Information Quarterly 18 (2001) 63–73	autonomous robot;bibliographic index;database;documentation;information systems;information management;information system;international standard book number;internet access;library (computing);robert;system information (windows);web page	Suzanne L.

While public-use data can be disseminated in a variety of ways, fewer options exist for sharing sensitive microdata that have not been fully de-identified for public use. Some data producers have sufficient economies of scale to develop advanced in-house solutions that serve the needs of external researchers, but most lack the resources to archive, curate, and disseminate the datasets they collect. The Data Enclave provides our partner organizations with a secure platform where they can both host and build a research community around their data. The Data Enclave currently serves more than 300 researchers and hosts confidential data for several federal agencies and foundations. The Data Enclave team values NORC's core mission to support informed decision making through objective data and analysis. The Data Enclave offers the full cycle of data services, ranging from study design and concept to data archiving and access. In addition to its expertise in metadata documentation and data dissemination, the Data Enclave provides a comprehensive set of analytic services.

The mobile market worldwide is dynamic in terms of technology development, and competition is aggressive. The potential size and growth rate of the Chinese, U.S., and European mobile markets warrant examination of the state of their wireless development. Here, we explore that growth by examining the differences among the three regions, especially those in mobile consumer demographics, Short Message Service (SMS) usage, and 3G technology.	mobile phone	Xiaoni Zhang;Victor R.

Based on a collaboration between three digital practitioners (a producer, a researcher and a designer), qualitative and creative data was gathered across five different kinds of TTG events in London and in Tartu which were held in partnership with large institutions, including Art:Work at Tate Exchange within Tate Modern, the Mozilla Festival at Ravensbourne College and the 2017 Association of Internet Researchers conference hosted in Tartu. By analysing data using an open and discursive approach manifested in both text and visual formats, we reflect on the dynamic and generative characteristics of TTG gatherings while also arriving at our own conclusions as situated researchers and practitioners who are ourselves engaged in increasingly messy webs where new worlds of theory and practice are built.	hackathon;situated	Luca M.

87a1df4dafc6b26e6bf72fe0a908b2c5ea2ad723	factor structure of the compulsive internet use scale		An important step in Internet addiction research is to develop standardized instruments for assessing Internet addiction-related symptoms. The Compulsive Internet Use Scale (CIUS) is a promising brief questionnaire. The aim of this study was to examine the factor structure of a German version of the CIUS with confirmatory factor analysis in a general population sample. In addition, the best fitting structure was tested for factorial invariance across sex, age, education level, and weekly Internet use. We used a weighted general population sample (N=8,132) of 14-64 years olds spending at least 1 hour online for private purposes per typical working or weekend day. Findings include that a one-factor model was found to fit well. It was invariant across sex, age, education level, and weekly Internet use. The findings support the validity of the CIUS as a short screening instrument.

Certain international agencies propose that Information and Communication Technology (ICT) allow this development to be reached more efficiently and quickly. While there are success stories galore, there is acknowledgement of not all investments in ICT bringing positive effects towards development. Following this development approach and choice framework, this paper discusses how the use of ICT can promote a more effective development, buy studying the case of Sudotec (an association for technological and industrial development in the southwest of the state of Paraná, in Brazil). It is a non-profit organization that saw in ICT the opportunity to change the local scenario. The results revealed positive effects of the use of ICT in social, economical and cultural spheres, not presenting political effect.

d8013362d8225ccae3d7098ab2e324a6652447cf	sweden cryptographic superpower a book review		Sweden has been solidly linked to cryptography for more than 70 years largely due to the efforts of Arvid Damm, Boris Hagelin and Yves Gyldén. Back in 1966, David Kahn wrote: “Quite possibly the finest feat of cryptanalysis performed by the Swedes, and the most far-reaching, was Arne Beurling’s solution of the German Siemens machine”; thus showing us the tip of the Swedish cryptanalytical iceberg. Now, Bengt Beckman, the former chief of FRA’s (Försvarets Radioanstalt) cryptanalytical department, has given us all the details about this magnificent feat and much more. The book contains a well of information. It starts with a short and clear introduction to ciphers and codes followed by an overview of Swedish cryptanalytical history including detailed accounts of how several of the breaks were performed. The second part of the book consists of three chapters dedicated to Professor Arne Beurling. Arne Beurling was clearly a genius, just like Alan Turing, he worked from first principles, however the similarity ends there. Arne Beurling was clearly a ladies’ man who liked an enjoyable evening in town, but he could also be stubborn and difficult; he is even known to have ended some arguments with his fists. Despite these flaws, Arne Beurling comes through as a very likeable character with a striking personality.	arne sølvberg;cipher;code;cryptanalysis;cryptography;damm algorithm;digital history;kahn process networks;oracle flashback;turing	Frode Weierud	1998	Cryptologia	10.1080/0161-119891886740	theoretical computer science;cryptography;computer science;superpower	Crypto	-63.547137775392386	-21.059742515549047	24418

After reviewing the literature it was found although many practitioners believe that KM practices are embodied in agile methodologies but it is not documented efficiently. Survey was used to take perception of agile organizations. KM practices are grouped into seven factors and respondents are taken from Indian software industry. Organizations are divided into different demographics: size, core area, type. Different statistical tests are used to conclude outputs of the questionnaire. It is found that Indian software industry working with agile practices lacks in providing any formal head for KM positioning. Learning and sharing through discussion forms is the most used practices among all respondents of organizations, whereas least accepted practice is dependent upon documents for transfer of knowledge. Indian organizations also lack in appointing a formal head who can provide guidelines for agile practice.	agile software development;core (optical fiber);knowledge management;software industry	Amitoj Singh;Kawaljeet Singh;Neeraj Sharma	2014	Innovations in Systems and Software Engineering	10.1007/s11334-014-0237-z	systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management	HCI	-85.1514385671187	2.1271913310089325	24485

Based on previous researches, the vast majority of information security incidents are caused by human factor, and not by flawed technology. Knowledge has been highlighted as one important parameter of the human factor in information security. Previous literature has suggested the Knowledge Management (KM) approach as one of the approaches to imple- ment information security management. However, the knowledge dimension of information security management in the healthcare industry has been neglec- ted. The goal of this paper is to investigate the relationship between security culture and KM. Thus, a conceptual model has been proposed to describe the relationship. The findings suggest that security culture may have a positive relationship with knowledge creation, knowledge sharing, and knowledge use through security behaviour. The proposed conceptual model will be further evaluated with selected healthcare organizations in Malaysia.	knowledge management	Noor Hafizah Hassan;Zuraini Ismail;Nurazean Maarop	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-08618-7_38	public relations;critical security studies;knowledge management;management science;business;corporate security;personal knowledge management;knowledge value chain;information security management	DB	-80.92019090963136	-1.4015335159185596	24613

Fear is one of the negative emotions where the situational state is motive-inconsistent and uncertainty is present. A review of literature explores distrust as a fear, emotions, emotional learning and identifies cognitive dimensions consistent with fear. These cognitive dimensions are motive-inconsistent situational state, uncertainty, goal-path obstacle, effort, and agency/control. Textual data is collected from an online auction community website to support this research. The dimensions consistent with fear are identified within the data collected and analyzed using qualitative analysis. Goal-path obstacles are identified within the data as; value incongruence, user isolation, user inefficacy, and financial. The goal-path obstacles identified are consistent with types of fear. The research findings are discussed in terms of the theory and offers suggestions to practitioners to improve the design of online auctions by reducing the effects of fear and emotional learning.	cognitive dimensions of notations;distrust;goal programming;high-level programming language;internet;text corpus	Glenn Robert Bewsell	2012	JTAER		e-commerce;public relations;perspective;emotion;appeal to fear;computer science;marketing;social emotional learning;world wide web	HCI	-90.8386925596432	-14.19699059616678	24650
d13244c468c26a51914ad0be73766b52cef1a3ce	the metamorphosis of malware writers		The reasons for writing malware are changing – and so is the malware itself. Danny Bradbury reports on the development of a seedy commercial market. a 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd. Bill Gates’ time is up. At the end of January 2004, at the Davos forum, he said that within two years, spam would be a thing of the past. In reality, the problem is as rampant as ever. On its own, that would be merely irritating, but for the past three years or so, developments in the relationships between spammers and malware writers have followed a worrying trend. Security experts agree that the two are colluding for profit, meaning that the motives and modus operandi of malware writers have been changing. ‘‘When I started in 1988, people were writing viruses and malware mostly to become famous,’’ recalls Righard J. Zwienenberg, Chief Research Officer at security software vendor Norman Data Systems. ‘‘Nowadays it’s moved from that field into the more organised crime field.’’ Botnets are largely responsible for bringing spammers and malware authors together. Known to most people working in security today, botnets are networks of compromised ‘zombie’ PCs which can be exploited by hackers for nefarious purposes. Networks of compromised servers were used from 2000 onwards for distributed denial of service attacks, but in the early days the motives were either just for the thrill of it, or to attack a political target such as an SCO, which was hit by a DDoS attack after taking a contentious legal position against Linux users. Security experts such as Miko Hypponnen, head of antivirus research at security firm F-Secure have said that 2003 was the year when things changed in a big way. The use of botnets became more organised as spammers realised that instead of relaying email through unprotected corporate SMTP servers which would soon be blacklisted, they could use thousands of PCs to send unsolicited commercial email. The malware writers who compromised the computers with Internet worms E-mail address: danny@itjournalist.com 0167-4048/$ – see front matter a 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd. doi:10.1016/j.cose.2006.01.003 realised that they could be rented out to spammers for a fee. As botnets created from compromised desktop PCs grew, they created a black market in zombie machines manipulated via IRC to send spam. ‘‘We’re seeing more evidence than ever before of that organized element coming into virus writing,’’ says Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant at Sophos. If sending spam from an unwitting users’ PC was not bad enough, other for-profit uses of botnets are even more sinister. ‘‘The Russian mafia is pretty well known nowadays, operating botnets to get details from credit cards,’’ says Zwienenberg. A compromised desktop PC can be programmed to log keystrokes and look for credit card numbers, for example, or monitor access to banking websites to harvest passwords. The Bancos Trojan, released early last year, is a good example of such an attack. For this reason, the nature of malware is changing. Internet worms designed to spread quickly were commonplace a couple of years ago, but 2005 saw fewer of these, says David Emm, senior technology consultant at anti-virus vendor Kaspersky Labs. ‘‘What we saw instead is where people want to send out malicious code, they’re spamming it deliberately,’’ he says. ‘‘They do an initial spam distribution and that’s it. So the thing doesn’t has legs of its own, it relies on the first blast.’’ The reason is twofold, explains Sophos’ Cluley. Firstly, sending out a rapidly proliferating worm to create a huge botnet is too obvious and raises too many alarms, prompting users to take security measures. Yesterday’s hobbyist malware writer was generally an adolescent male wanting to be noticed by his peers. Today’s for-profit malware writers want to stay under the radar, because if their product is noticed it prompts victims to take action and reduces c o m p u t e r s & s e c u r i t y 2 5 ( 2 0 0 6 ) 89 – 90 90 the number of compromised machines. This is why modern malware is less likely to deliver a payload obvious to the victim, such as deleting files from the hard drive. Organized commercial malware authors want to enslave, not destroy, their targets. Secondly, while it may be advantageous to co-opt as many PCs as possible to a botnet used for a DDoS attack, large numbers of zombie machines can be counterintuitive when using them for other purposes. ‘‘If the botnet does steal credit card information, [a very large botnet would provide] too much data for the criminals to handle,’’ points out Cluley. ‘‘They don’t want a million credit card numbers because that is too many to process.’’ Better to steal credit card numbers from 100 zombie machines, process them, and then create another 100 zombie PCs at your leisure. No wonder, then, that Sophos has seen a surge in the number of non-replicating Trojan horse programs being spammed out by email. Sixty-two percent of all malware programs that the company saw in 2005 were Trojan horses. This does not mean that DDoS attacks are a thing of the past, however. They have also evolved into a commercial venture for criminals. Companies such as online gambling sites and banks are receiving blackmail threats from criminal groups who threaten to bring down their websites for periods of time using botnet-originated DDoS techniques. Apart from the loss of face and customer confidence, this can also have a serious impact on revenue if, for example, an online betting site is taken down just before a highprofile sporting event. Another trick that F-Secure’s Hypponnen identified over a year ago was the use of botnet machines to host files. In one case, he found that crooks using some of the rarer toplevel identifiers such as .biz and .info were able to reduce DNS caching times to minutes, meaning that the destination machine behind an URL could be changed very quickly. Several machines on a botnet could then be loaded with content and used as temporary servers, making it difficult to shut down an illicit website. Such illegal websites can be used for activities such as selling counterfeit software. Peter Anaman, a senior Internet investigations manager who traces counterfeit software vendors for the Business Software Association began noticing botnets being used to host illicit websites last July. However, in the version he saw, the content did not reside on the compromised desktop PC. Instead, it resided on a server, which could be replicated in different regions to throw investigators off the trail. ‘‘Virus writers would offer infected computers on these botnets, and once they were infected they acted as web proxies,’’ he says. ‘‘Every time you did a reverse lookup to find out where something was hosted, you’d find a DSL account.’’ The people behind such cybercrimes come from multiple countries. In some cases, Anaman is convinced that organized crime groups associated with other physical crimes are also engaging in online crime. ‘‘Brazil is particularly the staging post for some of this stuff,’’ says Kaspersky’s Emm. ‘‘We have also seen activity coming out of the far east and Russia.’’ Some of the Russian malware encrypts data on the target machine and then asks the user for money in return for a decryption tool to return the user’s data. While such malware hides files and holds them to ransom, another kind does exactly the opposite, recovering sensitive files from PCs and delivering them to the attacker. The National High-Tech Crime Unit in the UK arrested Londonbased Michael Haephrati in 2005 as part of a law-enforcement exercise called Operation Racehorse. Haephrati was accused of supplying a Trojan horse program to hackers which would harvest confidential documents from a PC. Executives in several Israeli companies were placed under investigation for corporate espionage. Wherever they are from, it is likely that cybercriminals are using a different generation of malware writer to the typical maladjusted teen who has traditionally been the author of viruses in the past. Sophos has not seen any evidence of known virus writing groups such as 29A working with criminals – indeed, 29A is now largely dormant. Young people with computer skills who are not ethically mature may realise that they can make money from their activities, says Cluley. ‘‘Whether the serious organized criminals would want a teenager on their books or not is another question. They might make mistakes or brag about it. So I think the demographic is getting older.’’ Detecting and catching cybercrooks can be difficult. ‘‘They use thousands of domain names registered worldwide through different registrars,’’ says Anaman of the criminals using botnets as proxies to illegal websites. ‘‘These are kept in hibernation until used. Those in hibernation, which is a good 75% of them, are harder to find.’’ Anaman will adapt standard network tools in innovative ways to help gather evidence. For example, he may conduct a batch WHOIS lookup to find all of the domain names registered by the same person and try to cluster registration information and identify trends. But even after these efforts it can be difficult to pin down the perpetrators. ‘‘We have had a lot of problems because once you have crimes committed across borders, although there is great co-operation between countries it isn’t as refined as it should be,’’ Anaman says. ‘‘So a lot of cases have to be dropped because there isn’t enough evidence in a particular country to support it.’’ In England, the National High-Tech Crime Unit worked extensively with authorities in other countries to try and tackle the problem, but it is an uphill battle. The Internet’s strength is a weakness for law-enforcement agencies. Electronic Frontier Foundation co-founder John Gilmore said in 1993 that the Internet treats censorship as damage and routes around it. That may be true, but what applies to censorship may also apply to law enforcement.

ea369f3074c7cf7058f3b4378b71049ceb92fba2	introduction to the minitrack on truth and lies: deception and cognition on the internet		Recent events demonstrate a need for greater research on deception, biases, and trust on the Internet. Over the past year, the topic of fake news and its consequences have become omnipresent in the media and on social networking sites, but this is not a new issue. Fake reviews of products and services, fake social media accounts and posts, and fake advertising have long been a feature of the Internet. The effects of deception on businesses and society are tangible in terms of decreased brand image, sales, and loss of trust. This minitrack examines deception on the Internet, and why individuals fall prey to it. Information selection biases, such as confirmation bias, affect the types of information that individuals process. These selection biases inform how individuals structure their attitudes and create their perceptions of reality. This minitrack focuses on information that is demonstrably false but provided on the Internet in order to manipulate an individual’s attitudes towards a business, product, or other societal issues. It also takes the lens of the individual’s response to the deception from bias in processing the information to the actions individuals take after they have received the information. Several high-quality submissions were received for the inaugural minitrack. We hope to offer this minitrack for in HICSS to come as the continued evolution of deception on the Internet calls for increased research on the topic area. For the inaugural minitrack, we have four papers organized into one session. Says Who?: How News Presentation Format Influences Perceived Believability and the Engagement Level of Social Media Users by Antino Kim and Alan Dennis investigates the format of news presentation at its effect on perceived believability and engagement level in social media. The findings provide insights into how the presentation format affects how the users perceive and, subsequently, act on news. Disruption and Deception in Crowdsourcing: Towards a Crowdsourcing Risk Framework by Agnieszka Onuchowska and Gert-Jan de Vreede examines the emergence of disruptive and deceptive issues in crowdsourcing. The authors create a framework for the efforts to deceive in the crowdsourcing arena. Combating Fake News: An Investigation of Information Verification Behaviors on Social Networking Sites by Russell Torres, Natalie Gerhart, and Arash Negahban examines how users of social networking sites determine when to check on validity of news. The authors provide several insightful findings on the key drivers for users’ news verification behavior. A Tale of Two Internet News Platforms-Real vs. Fake: An Elaboration Likelihood Model Perspective by Babajide Osatuyi and Jerald Hughes provides a field analysis of real and fake news that is propagated on the Internet using an Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) perspective. The authors examine the amount of information disseminated by fake news platforms and reputable news platforms, analyzing the business impact of fake news. We are pleased to have had such great submissions to the minitrack and look forward to a great discussion on deception and the Internet at HICSS-51!

Despite the design of various challenge levels in online games, exactly how these challenges increase customer loyalty to online games has seldom been examined. This study investigates how such challenges increase customer loyalty to online games. The study sample comprises 2,861 online gamers. Structural equation modeling is performed. Analytical results indicate that the relationship between challenge and loyalty intensifies when customers perceive that overcoming challenges takes a long time. Results of this study contribute to efforts to determine how challenges and challenge-related perceptions impact customer loyalty to online games.	personnel loyalty;structural equation modeling	Ching-I Teng	2013	Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking	10.1089/cyber.2012.0182	loyalty business model;customer retention	HCI	-89.39845774717556	-10.66440434415408	24766

IOS integration thus has become critical in facilitating tighter integration between trading partners. Firms, however, still face various difficulties that impede the implementation of IOS integration, such as potential adversarial behaviors and conflicts. Thus, exploring how to effectively promote IOS integration is significant for both theory development and practice. This study applies the concept of compromise and develops interfirm process compromise and technology compromise based on the relational view. These two compromise constructs, as relational preconditions, are proposed to affect the achievement of better IOS integration. The results of this study support the hypothesized direct effect of technology compromise on IOS integration based on 44 matched-pair samples gathered from the top 1000 Taiwanese manufacturing firms. We also propose and show the indirect effect of interfirm process compromise on IOS integration, mediated by technology compromise. Our results provide the theoretical and practical implications that contribute a better understanding of the role of compromises in developing IOS integration. The model and findings of this study should be able to serve as a basis for future research in examining IOS integration.	organizational behavior;precondition;system integration;the globe and mail	Eric T.

It is essential to provide the right information at the right level of quality and reliability and at the right time. Geographic information (GI) is today being universally recognised as a key part of the national information infrastructure, especially by government. GI is an enabler in the knowledge economy since the power of geography can be used to underpin the sharing (and trading) of vital georeferenced information collected by all kinds of organisations. From this information reliable conclusions can and will be drawn and decisions made. However, achieving such an environment does not just happen. It has to be led, nurtured and developed in line with user needs. Funding requires sustained investment, and it all has to be implemented and maintained whether the economy enjoys good times or bad, and through periods of political change. These are all big challenges encountered by just about every national economy. The aim of many national governments around the world is to establish a reliable and integrated reference base for GI that can underpin the e-economy. This base needs to support government and the commercial sector who need to reference information, and potentially share it with others (eg land ownership) or link it up to form an application.(eg location based services). To achieve this a consistent method of georefererencing is required and the Digital National Framework is intended to fulfil that need in Great Britain. This paper will describe what has been happening in Great Britain to build on the firm foundations of the past, and develop a modern and sustainable framework for geographic information for the future. In particular it will be shown that the business model adopted by Ordnance Survey in recent years (ie the users pay for the data) has played a key role in securing the ongoing funding of the modern information infrastructure that many nations are now working towards. It will also be seen that this does not mean exorbitant prices and in reality several valuable services are free of charge.	data infrastructure;geographic information system;location-based service;national information infrastructure	Keith J.

Based on a survey sample of Korean college students, this study investigated the differences in game adoption (1) between adopters (including continuers and discontinuers) and nonadopters (including potentials and resistors), (2) between continuers and discontinuers, and (3) between potentials and resistors of online games. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that demographic profiles and innovativeness were strong predictive constructs for predicting online game adoption.

There is a great shift now towards reaching beyond borders, especially designing for the people at the bottom of the pyramid. In this panel, we will concentrate on two areas that the design can play a significant role in advancement of societies: (1) Design for improving socio-economic structure such education, health, food and shelter, (2) Design for creating commercially viable products that can create sustainable businesses.

1b90954cb24528d6883482cc43644146bf9b0c68	individual infusion of information systems: the role of adaptation and individual cognitions		Information system (IS) infusion denotes the degree to which an IS is fully integrated into an organization’s or individual’s work practices, and the degree to which the full potential of the IS is being exploited. Most infusion research has focused on broad antecedents of the construct at an organizational level. The current study examines infusion at an individual level. Specifically, it examines how the adaptation process impacts individual-level IS infusion. Based on theories of adaptation and cognition, a theoretical model of IS adaptation and infusion is developed. The model will be tested using a multi-method field study at a large health care provider firm. This research will contribute to theoretical understanding of the influence of the IS adaptation process on IS infusion and provide insight for managers who are interested in fostering IS infusion in their organizations.	cognition;field research;information system;theory	Kelly J.

This paper presents the results of a content analysis of 203 randomly-selected Weblogs, comparing the empirically observable features of the corpus with popular claims about the nature of Weblogs, and finding them to differ in a number of respects. Notably, blog authors, journalists and scholars alike exaggerate the extent to which blogs are interlinked, interactive, and oriented towards external events, and underestimate the importance of blogs as individualistic, intimate forms of self-expression. Based on the profile generated by the empirical analysis, we consider the likely antecedents of the blog genre, situate it with respect to the dominant forms of digital communication on the Internet today, and advance predictions about its long-term impacts.	blog;bridging (networking);observable;randomness;situated cognition;web page	Susan C.

The adoption of e-voting technology and outcomes in public confidence in elections processes and results are at significant variance between the U.S. and Europe. We argue that the causes of this variance are rooted in divergent inputs of political traditions that only loosely define systems requirements. In the case of the U.S., several factors, most notably balkanization of the elections processes, have led to the current situation where e-voting technology is a poor fit for unclear systems requirements that are only now becoming clearly understood. A comparative analysis of European and U.S. experiences is the basis for a solvable problem statement for the U.S. situation, together with a solution approach that is being attempted at present.	abductive reasoning;coherence (physics);decision problem;functional requirement;iteration;qualitative comparative analysis;software deployment;trust (emotion)	John Sebes;Gregory A.

991eb99575e2aefcf3694e662e08ccba889d96a5	estimating the determinants of public private partnerships in infrastructure: the case of india		Public private partnership (PPP) mode of financing is quickly becoming the favoured way to invest and fund infrastructure in India. This paper focuses exclusively on the PPP mode of infrastructure financing by examining and estimating the significant determinants of attracting any PPP in India. The empirical findings indicate that for India a higher cash deficit with huge government debt tends to attract more number of PPP projects. The study also suggests that political factors play a crucial role for the private sector in terms of making decisions regarding involvement of the PPP mode for financing infrastructure. Ultimately, there is evidence in favour of all the channels except the macroeconomic factors. While examining the investment aspect for PPPs, it was concluded that soft governmental constraints, market conditions and effectiveness of government proved to be decisive.		Varun Chotia;N. V.

The issue of optimal assortm ent planning in the retail sector becomes even more important in periods of economic crisis, as retaile rs must adapt their product portfolios to new evolving patterns of consumer buying behaviour and reduced levels of consumer’s purchasing power. Private labels (PLs) typically experience significant growth in times of recession, due to the ir low prices, and the reduced disposable income of households. In this direction, the present paper introduces Differential Evolution (DE) to assist retailers in adapting their product portfolios in periods of economic recession and facilitate strategic PAP decisions, related to a) optimal variety of PL product categories, b) optimal service level of PL merchandise within a product category, and hence, c) optimal balance between PLs and National Brands (NBs) in a retailer’s product portfolio. The interrelated issue of assortment adaptation across different store formats is also considered. Economic recessions contribute to the prolonged upward evolution in PL share, and hence, our mechanism facilitates decisions that are nowadays more important than ever before. The proposed mechanism is illustrated through an implementation to an empirical dataset derived from a random sample of 1,928 consumers who participated in a large-scale computer assisted telephone survey during the current economic crisis period.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);computer programming;differential evolution;digital photo professional (dpp);diversification (finance);e-commerce;emoticon;information system;mathematical optimization;php;pl/i;password authentication protocol;plasma cleaning;point of sale;purchasing;scheduling (computing);service-oriented architecture;simulated annealing;unified framework	Stelios Tsafarakis;Charalampos Saridakis;Nikolaos F.

26b5b0e63b443c1afbc4eb9e8f8b765e6f1fd6c9	put on a smiley face: textspeak and personality perceptions		With the emergence of Web 2.0, there has been a dramatic surge in user-generated content. Although the Internet provides greater freedom in self-presentation, computer-mediated communication is characterized by a more relaxed attitude to grammar, spelling, and punctuation. The language of the Internet, or textspeak, may be suitable for casual interactions but inappropriate in professional contexts. Participant perceptions of an author's personality were tested in two distinct contexts (formal vs. informal) and the written information was manipulated under three levels of textspeak: none, low, and high. Participants judged the author as less conscientious and less open but more emotionally stable when textspeak was used. However, context had no impact. Personality perceptions of textspeak users differ to those who write in Standard English, and this is likely to extend to informal impression management contexts (e.g., online dating). These findings also have a number of implications, for example in terms of screening applicants via social media.	antisocial personality disorder;computer-mediated communication;emergence;facial pain;interaction;internet;relaxation;sms language;social media;user-generated content;virtual screening;web 2.0;spelling	Chris Fullwood;Sally Quinn;Josephine Chen-Wilson;Darren Chadwick;Katie Reynolds	2015	Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking	10.1089/cyber.2014.0463	psychology;artificial intelligence;multimedia;psychotherapist;communication;social psychology	HCI	-86.31956783035245	-19.540054774096905	25135

It draws on the ideas of critical systems thinking (CST), a research perspective that encourages the analysis of stakeholders’ understandings prior to the selection and implementation of planning methods. The framework emphasizes continuous identification of concerns from stakeholders, and facilitates critical reflection in the exploration of possibilities for improvement. Some of these possibilities might require the support of IS and communication technologies. To define the framework, two systems theories are used: boundary critique and autopoiesis. The first one enables critical reflection on values and assumptions about potential situations or marginalization. The second one fosters continuous dialogue, listening and mutual collaboration between participants. With these theories, the framework enables people to reflect on issues of inclusion, exclusion and marginalization, and to participate in the design of plans for improvement. Ultimately, the definition of this framework suggests the importance of critical reflection about ethics to improve the practice of IS planning.	critical systems thinking;information system	José-Rodrigo Córdoba-Pachón	2009	Inf.

253002c97952aca74cc1c3e32644cfa05de7b951	a framework describing the relationships among social technologies and social capital formation in electronic entrepreneurial networking	electronic commerce;entrepreneurship;social capital;social networks;virtual organizations;communities of practice	E-commerce technologies—including online exchanges—focus heavily on transaction support. They are designed primarily to reduce transaction costs between suppliers, producers, distributors, and customers. Entrepreneurs however are not likely to realize the full business potential of ecommerce unless the transaction technologies are simultaneously supported by technology-enabled social learning networks used to stimulate the formation of social capital in its three primary manifestations. Toward that end this article argues that a number of Internet-based social technologies (e.g., email, chat, blogs, wikis, podcasts, etc.) can be used more effectively when it is understood that each technology offers different characteristics in support of the formation of different dimensions of social capital. This article presents a conceptual framework describing the capacities of various social technologies for supporting the formation of social capital. A primary thrust of the article is that alignment of a social technology infrastructure with the social capital requirements in entrepreneurial communities will facilitate the formation of electronic learning networks, enabling more collaborative and therefore more successful entrepreneurial communities.

On the basis of such data, journals could be subdivided into specialized, average, or general using an appropriate measure of dispersion (or concentration). To this end, Pratt's absolute measure of dispersion q = σr∗ Fr, is suggested, where the Fr, represent the relative frequencies (in descending order) of articles from a given journal in the unidentified subject subdivisions with rank r = 1, 2, …, n. In order to separate specialized and general journals from average ones, it is assumed that each empirical q-value has a ‘random’ deviation d. A w-statistic is introduced to test whether the q-values differ significantly from the average qav on a specified confidence level, where w = (q — qav)/d. In addition, a subject relative measure of dispersion Q is used to determine which subdivisions are favored by which journals. Another w-statistic is proposed to test whether the Q-values differ significantly from Qs (absolute measure of dispersion of the subject distribution). This bibliometric technique is applied to data from the 1984 INSPEC file. The results could help library staff and information scientists in classifying journals according to the two measures of article dispersion over subject subdivisions.	bibliometrics	Radosvet Todorov;Wolfgang Glänzel	1990	Inf.

For example Europe and America have different policies with respect to genetically modified foods and nuclear energy. Our goal is to explore information behaviors that surround the process of transforming scientific evidence into public policy in order to uncover where (and how) cultural values might be embedded. We analyzed more than a thousand citations from three scientific reviews that were conducted by scientists based in the EU and US on di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), a plastic softener that is controversial because of potential impacts for industry and public health. Our analysis suggests that culture may influence public policy by establishing the initial scope of a review, by determining which evidence should be included, and by framing how evidence is presented.	display resolution;embedded system;framing (world wide web);value (ethics)	Catherine Blake;Jinlong Guo	2014		10.1002/meet.2014.14505101164	social science;socioeconomics;sociology;law;policy studies	AI	-74.41602337288784	-14.172796469528912	25402

The core argument developed in this paper is that the rapid development of information and communication technologies in the last twenty years has given rise to a paradigm shift of how collective problems are being solved in the future. The research presented in this paper builds on the Electronic Market Hypothesis developed by Malone at al. (1987) and provides empirical evidence from federated identity development. The paper thus contributes to academic theory development of electronic governance and reduces the current confusion of what electronic governance is or might be.	e-government;federated identity;identity management;programming paradigm	Thomas Zwahr;Pierre Rossel;Matthias Finger	2005			public relations;paradigm shift;information and communications technology;empirical evidence;epistemology;knowledge management;environmental resource management;information technology	DB	-76.39052769865945	-3.7475574577707884	25541

This technical note examines the undesirable situation that created the TRL from the traditional and holistic problem-solving processes. The contribution of this technical note to the problem-solving body of knowledge is that the holistic thinking approach could have produced a more useful conceptual tool than the TRL for determining the future availability of technology; a tool that instead of focusing on the early stages of the technology lifecycle focuses on the whole technology lifecycle from conceptualization to obsolescence.	capability maturity model;conceptualization (information science);dmsms;holism;problem solving;vii	Joseph E.

However their growth is limited to only 20% of the economy even though they comprise 87% of businesses in Nebraska. Research has shown that IT adoption can increase their growth by 3.5% but the challenges to IT adoption by microenterprises are many. Current theoretical models on IT adoption focus on the intent to adopt IT in large organizations where employees’ attitudes and perceptions are measured in terms of their objectives within the structures of accountability. Microenterprises are unique in that the intention to adopt is an individual cognitive decision made by the micro-entrepreneur. It is often the ways in which IT is used and can be used to grow their businesses that effect the adoption decisions made by the micro-entrepreneurs. This paper considers the adoption of IT by micro-enterprises through a focus group session. Following a qualitative analysis of the data using constructs from the Theory of Planned Behavior and Social Cognitive Theory, this paper uncovers patterns that provide insight into the attitudes and perceptions that effect the adoption of IT by micro-entrepreneurs. The contribution of this paper is in the discovery of patterns and categories of micro-entrepreneurial attitudes and perceptions that effect the adoption of IT.

There is a host of possible explanations, but little consensus on which are responsible, or even on whether the paradox still exists - if it ever really did. This paper also considers a further matter whether the waves of management methods accompanying investment in IT have been determined not so much by organisational requirements as by the opportunities offered by IT, by crude, old-fashioned technological determinism, in fact. This might help explain why so many of these methods seem to fail in terms of the organisational requirements by which they are justified.	technological determinism	Stuart Macdonald	2002	IJITM	10.1504/IJITM.2002.001185	economics;computer science;operations management;management science;management;law;information technology	HCI	-75.34448698270646	-2.5502939145839134	25825

Harris. Its mission is to alleviate poverty by facilitating access to Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) for underserved sections of society in Asia, and to ensure they are able to make good use of the technology according to their own development aspirations. Dr. Harris has been working in this field since 1997 and the firm has been providing consulting and knowledge sharing services for six years in the area of ICTs for poverty reduction and rural development in Asia. Services include; policy advice and development, programme design and evaluation services, project implementation assistance and research to governments, international development agencies and civil society bodies. The company also engages directly in project activities in the same field of work, partnering where appropriate with communities, civil society bodies, development and government agencies. Direct involvement in grass-roots activities contributes to the firm’s ability to offer advice that is strongly evidential and this has lead to the formulation of practical and widely-adopted approaches that are anchored in a thorough understanding of the challenges of the use of ICTs for rural poverty reduction. One such initiative, called Asian Encounters promotes the use of ICTs in support of pro-poor community-based tourism. RHA partners with its associates according to the requirements of its assignments. It works with a network of associates in several countries, including Hong Kong, Vietnam, Malaysia, Nepal and India. Past assignments have involved work in: Malaysia, Mongolia, Nepal, Lao PDR, Vietnam, Philippines, China, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand, Taiwan, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Peru.	advice (programming);design review (u.s. government);harris affine region detector;requirement	Roger Harris;Robert M.

b45708aca03956fa8df5845e78d66ff70a90d728	educating judges, prosecutors and lawyers in the use of digital forensic experts		Recent years have seen an exponential growth of evidence in digital forensic investigations. Digital Forensics (DF) experts are predicting, amongst others, a ’digital explosion’ of ransomware in the coming years. The legal community must be prepared to deal with an increase of digital evidence in both volume and complexity. In cooperation with experts in the field, the Netherlands Register of Court Experts (NRGD) has recently developed standards and registration requirements for DF experts in the Netherlands. This article describes how these standards were established and provides insight into the requirements that a DF expert should meet to qualify as an NRGD registered expert. Registration is now open to all DF experts, both Dutch and non-Dutch. Furthermore, this article can be used by DF experts worldwide to educate judges, prosecutors and lawyers that make use of their reports. It illustrates what the legal community can expect from DF court experts, it provides a demarcation of the DF field based on DF literature and it presents examples of relevant questions that can or should be asked to a DF expert. © 2018 The Author(s).

Computing research in academia has commensurately seen dramatic increases, both in computing-specific research and research using computing. This article maps out the academic computing landscape by examining the connections between computing-related keywords used to describe theses and dissertations. Specifically, data from 29,435 dissertations and theses found in the ProQuest Theses and Dissertation database in the years 2009–2014 were analyzed. Results identify interdisciplinary clusters, as well as identify key differences in connections between the four computing disciplines in the database: computer science (CS), computer engineering (CE), information technology (IT), and information science (ISci). For example, authors who primarily identify with CS rarely list secondary keywords, while authors from a high variety of other disciplines list CS as a secondary keyword. CE is tightly focused and growing, but rarely seen as a relevant secondary keyword by other fields. Meanwhile, the highly interdisciplinary nature of IT and ISci is shown, along with different subgroups within those areas. While the total number of unique theses with computing-related keywords has remained steady, they have shifted dramatically between specific computing fields (e.g., away from CS toward CE and IT). Visualizations present information on the growth and change in focus of computing-related theses and dissertations, as well as networks of keywords that co-occur.

These libraries operate in a collegial, cooperative way yet each operates independently of the others. This arrangement allows the individual missions of each of the Libraries to be met while ensuring collaboration and cooperation. The many initiatives within and among the USF Libraries depend upon a reliable and advanced networked infrastructure and on staff, facility and financial decisions focussed on true programmatic cooperation. This paper addresses the interaction between the USF Libraries in defining and realising institutional commitment to its virtual library plan. The USF Virtual Libraries Planning Committee first convened in September 1995. At that meeting, the committee was charged with the task of preparing a proposal for a university-wide virtual library. The committee was comprised of eight librarians, seven representing the USF Libraries and the eighth from Florida Gulf Coast University who provided an outsider view of the process. The three USF campuses serve a variety of clientele, ranging from a large undergraduate and graduate research library, an undergraduate and graduate regional campus	digital library;entity;librarian;library (computing)	Ardis Hanson	2000			library science;engineering;knowledge management;environmental resource management	SE	-74.07154280656083	-5.829731282932011	25904

These priorities are often politically motivated, deceptive, and influence the degree to which different funding priorities are met. Government agencies seek to increase their budget without increasing performance, and often receive additional funding from legislatures seeking oversight of these same agencies for not performing. One method of influencing these priorities is to discover similar funding within competing states and compare relative levels. This information can then be used as political motivation to increase or decrease IT funding to specific areas.	benchmark (computing)	Mark Kerwood;Gary Hackbarth;James Kurtenbach	2004			government;public relations;politics;computer science;legislature	HCI	-74.60626679290723	-12.14025711284717	25914

An attempt is made to determine whether measures to improve the interaction between IT systems and users can also improve the way that know‐how is used in the organization. In this context, the purpose of this paper is two‐fold: to present ideas that can be used to understand current development in specific organizations[1]; and to outline measures for applying such ideas to other organizations in the future.

3551af22dfb497c0bf35f5a6a64cc5d57620a79c	the importance of esecurity in the overall estrategy of an organisation		Information security strategy is necessary in organizations in order to determine their risks and providing suitable policies and procedures for appropriate controls and countermeasures to manage those risks. Still too often the human factor is underestimated and people do not know how to choose safe passwords, how to react when they find out about a security breach, all that due to the fact that they are not properly trained or educated. Information security is not just a technical issue but also a policy and human issue that requires the use of technology to protect the business information. Our goal should be to clearly define roles and responsibilities of information security officer and all employees in an organization to improve overall security and the protection of that information. 1 The Need For A Clear Strategy Our society has undergone a profound change. Information systems and information infrastructure in companies have considerably changed in recent years and became more distributed, and as such, much more complex to manage. Business information is dispersed, as local area networks and departmental systems have replaced the centralised mainframes. Only 15% of employees had access to corporate data in 1985, but by year 2000 the number had risen to over 85% (Yapp, 2000, p. 23). Information is an important asset which has a value to an organization and therefore needs to be well protected (ISO/IEC 17799:2000). The increased dependence of organizations on information and communication technologies and the changed business model due to globalisation and internationalisation has rapidly increased the need for systematic and professional protection of that information. Information security becomes now more complicated and is not restricted only to maintain confidentiality, availability and integrity, but we need to put strong emphasis also on responsibility, integrity and people (Dhillon, p. 1, 2001). Most companies, do not have a written information security policy or e-security strategy, nor they have authorized people that are responsible for information security management.	authorization;centralisation;computer security;confidentiality;content management system;hoc (programming language);human factors and ergonomics;iso/iec 42010;information systems;information security;information system;internationalization and localization;intranet;mainframe computer;password;physical security;poor posture;protection mechanism;security management;undefined behavior;yapp	Aleksander Iinigoj	2004			environmental resource management;information infrastructure;information system;information security;information security management;business;know-how;business information;information and communications technology;business model	Security	-72.5667826371192	2.5271327870477993	25950

The data were analyzed using structural equations modeling with AMOS.Findings – The empirical findings showed that, first, as far as the online travel communities members are concerned, both interactivity and trust do affect each other. Second, interactivity is the key factor for the members to have flow experience in online travel communities. Third, the experience of flow can enhance the transaction intentions of members while they are in the online travel communities.Practical implications – Web site administrators should improve the interactivity with the members, so that they can have flow experience, and further strengthen their transaction intentions.Origin...	interactivity	Jyh-Jeng Wu;Yong-Sheng Chang	2005	Industrial Management and Data Systems	10.1108/02635570510616120	e-commerce;public relations;structural equation modeling;design methods;computer science;marketing;advertising;trustworthy computing	HCI	-88.45969184771644	-12.433264710472631	26043
aec7188282fe76937299d8806994c3e2e89f1a09	toward common components for open workflow systems		The role of scalable high-performance workflows and flexibleworkflow management systems that can support multiple simulations will continue to increase in importance. For example, with the end of Dennard scaling, there is a need to substitute a single long running simulation with multiple repeats of shorter simulations, or concurrent replicas. Further, many scientific problems involve ensembles of simulations in order to solve a higher-level problem or produce statistically meaningful results. However most supercomputing software development and performance enhancements have focused on optimizing singlesimulation performance. On the other hand, there is a strong inconsistency in the definition and practice of workflows and workflow management systems. This inconsistency often centers around the difference between several different types of workflows, including modeling and simulation, grid, uncertainty quantification, and purely conceptual workflows. This work explores this phenomenon by examining the different types of workflows and workflow management systems, reviewing the perspective of a large supercomputing facility, examining the common features and problems of workflow management systems, and finally presenting a proposed solution based on the concept of common building blocks. The implications of the continuing proliferation of workflow management systems and the lack of interoperability between these systems are discussed from a practical perspective. In doing so, we have begun an investigation of the design and implementation of open workflow systems for supercomputers based upon common components.

However, how differential these signals are in terms of their capacity to improve sales performance has not yet been investigated. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach – Drawing on signaling theory and grounded in the context of China’s largest e-marketplace, Taobao, this study investigated the different effects of five commonly used signals on the sales performance of e-marketplace sellers. Findings – The authors find that warranty has the highest effect on sales performance, followed by overall rating, mean detailed seller rating, percent of positives, and web site quality. Originality/value – First, this study builds on signaling theory and contributes to the e-marketplace literature by providing new insights into how specific signals differentially affect sales performance in the e-marketplace (with evidence from a large-scale empirical analysis). Second, the study extends the applicability of signaling theory to the e-marketplace domain by incorporating distinctive features of the e-marketplace into the original signaling theory. Finally, the findings lend practical support to e-marketplace sellers’ investment decisions on signals and provide guidelines for deployment of such signals.	e-commerce;purchasing;software deployment;taobao marketplace	Huifang Li;Yulin Fang;Youwei Wang;Kai H.

To oppose copyright is to oppose capitalism. Thus, Marxism is a natural starting point when challenging copyright. Marxu0027s concept of a u0027general intellectu0027, suggesting that at some point a collective learning process will surpass physical labour as a productive force, offers a promising backdrop to understand the accomplishments of the free software community. Furthermore, the chief concerns of hacker philosophy, creativity and technological empowerment, closely correspond to key Marxist concepts of alienation, the division of labour, deskilling, and commodification. At the end of my inquiry, I will suggest that the development of free software provides an early model of the contradictions inherent to information capitalism, and that free software development has a wider relevance to all future production of information.

This reflects the globally accepted goals of teaching history courses. Such teaching goals can be greatly supported by computer-based applications, which can offer access to vast amounts of historical texts and data to be used next to the main scholar textbook and be analyzed by pupils. Still, existing applications seem to be quite inadequate for this purpose, as they require that the pupil be already informed on a matter, before the initiation of a quest for data. In this paper, we describe an intelligent information system that is designed to facilitate browsing of educational material and historical sources, thus allowing pupils to efficiently retrieve information on topics that are not yet known to them and expand in this way their historical knowledge. This can help in fulfilling the teaching goals of the new educational system.	airport security;information system	Manolis Wallace;Mary Stefanou;Kostas Karpouzis;Stefanos D.

d2d2e929eb66b1e1dc35c792ba8f00d26a40668c	on the gender of books: author gender mixing in book communities		Using a book co-buying network from amazon.com of over 1 million books, we find empirically that readers who have purchased male first authors before are substantially less likely than expected to buy books by female first authors, when aggregated across the entire book market. Conversely, past buyers of female authors are slightly more likely than expected to buy other female authors. This same-gender assortativity is found to be local: certain writing genres are “coloured” preferentially by one gender. This can be attributed both to writer availability (i.e., a gender’s preferential attachment to writing for one genre), and to the buyers’ preferential attachment to the output of writers of one gender. We obtain these insights by classifying the gender of the first author for most of the books, then running statistical tests which compare the gender makeup of books co-bought with either male or female books. Structural book communities, as generated from readers’ co-buying choices, are computed, visualised in terms of gender makeup, and their writing genres are summarised to match the genre with a gender makeup.	book	Doina Bucur	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-72150-7_64	gender studies;preferential attachment;gender history;assortativity;history	ML	-80.71002879534703	-21.29667869734601	26273

Therefore identifying factors that influence users' intention to adopt and continuously use a particular SNS is a critical issue. To explore the factors, this study aims to apply the theories of reasoned action, uses and gratifications, and innovation diffusion to explain why people continue to join SNSs. Design/methodology/approach – The study participants were members of Facebook in Taiwan. An online questionnaire was used to conduct empirical research, and the data of 348 respondents were analysed using the partial least squares regression approach. Findings – It was found that the reasons why people continuously use SNSs vary with different innovation diffusion stages.

Although the use of computer-mediated communication and social network sites such as Facebook for event promotion is becoming popular, online participation in an event does not always translate to offline attendance. In this paper, we report on an interview study of 31 participants that examines how people handle online event invitations and what influences their online and offline participation. The results show that people's event participation is shaped by their social perceptions of the event's nature (e.g., public or private), their relationships to others (e.g., the strength of their connections to other invitees), and the medium used to communicate event information (e.g., targeted invitation via email or spam communication via Facebook event page). By exploring how people decide whether to participate online or offline, the results illuminate the sophisticated nature of the mechanisms that affect participation and have design implications that can bridge virtual and real attendance.	computer-mediated communication;email;online and offline;social network;spamming	Ai-Ju Huang;Hao-Chuan Wang;Tina Chien-Wen Yuan	2014		10.1145/2531602.2531606	psychology;internet privacy;communication;world wide web;computer-mediated communication;online participation	HCI	-83.44017382174071	-18.171205840143003	26523

Thereby, we first briefly distinguish five different definitions of cooperative advertising which can be found in operations research literature. After that, we concentrate on vertical cooperative advertising, which is the most common object of investigation and is understood as a financial agreement where a manufacturer offers to pay a certain share of his retailer’s advertising expenditures. In total, we identified 58 scientific papers considering mathematical modeling of vertical cooperative advertising. These articles are then analyzed with regard to their general model setting (e.g., the underlying supply chain structure and design of the cooperative advertising program). After that, we explain the different demand and cost functions that are employed, whereupon we distinguish between static and dynamic models. The last dimension of our review is dedicated to the game-theoretic concepts which are mostly used to reflect different forms of distribution of power within the channel.	algorithm;arrow (computer science);bilateral filter;cooperative multitasking;existential quantification;game theory;mathematical model;metaheuristic;nist hash function competition;operations research;row echelon form;scientific literature;social capital;throughput;tracing (software);word-sense disambiguation	Gerhard Aust;Udo Buscher	2014	European Journal of Operational Research	10.1016/j.ejor.2013.08.010	public relations;game theory;economics;native advertising;marketing;advertising	ECom	-76.40303937425826	0.5282300522452984	26540

The study also suggests new analytical categories of research. Drawing on the analysis, inputs for a research agenda are suggested. These include the need to move beyond a technological perspective, encouraging the ongoing shift of research focus from government to citizens and other stakeholders, and the need to make eParticipation research methods more participatory in nature.

It is a data-dependent activity requiring information systems support. Thus, many  It -based products are available to treasurers. An exploratory study has revealed that corporate treasurers are concerned with five core activities in which they exploit a rich set of information sources. They appear to rely on personal and informal information processes as much as use more formal systems and  It  products. Paradoxically, most computer systems have focussed on external data collection where treasurers generally have developed their own effective intelligence networks. Conversely, internal data collection, which appears to be problematic in most corporations, so far has benefitted little from  It . Treasurers' usage of  It  has been mainly confined to small, local or personal systems. These have been developed or acquired with scant involvement of in-house  Mis  departments.

The trade in information goods – resulting from the outsourcing of the production – is a typical transaction which can be analysed using transaction cost theory. Taking into account the particular characteristics of information goods and the process of delivering them through digital networks, three out of five sources of transaction costs can be identified which are most relevant for the outsourcing decision. In designing the transaction process, these sources (bounded rationality, opportunism and uncertainty) can be influenced by the transaction partners in order to reduce market-based transaction costs. Employing an intermediary can further reduce transaction costs resulting from bounded rationality and uncertainty but can (overall) also give rise to opportunism. We find that opportunism is the most relevant source of transaction costs if an intermediary is employed on the market for information goods.	digital electronics;display resolution;european conference on information systems;online community;outsourcing;rationality;relevance;sensitivity and specificity;utility;web content;web syndication	Markus Anding;Thomas Hess	2002			industrial organization;extreme transaction processing;transaction cost;economics;marketing;transaction data;search cost;online transaction processing;microeconomics;financial transaction;commerce	Security	-70.20669883709736	-1.0561064494707193	26641

Nevertheless, as they say in sunny France, 'Attention! Un train peut cacher un autre!' As the years went by, and as I began to find out something at last about Chinese science and society, I came to realise that there is a second question at least equally important, namely, why, between the –st century and the th century, was Chinese civilisation much more efficient than occidental in gaining natural knowledge and in applying it to practical human needs? The answer to all such questions lies, I now believe, primarily in the social, intellectual and economic structures of the different civilisations. The comparison between China and Europe is particularly instructive, almost a bench-test experiment one might say, because the complicating factor of climatic conditions does not enter in. Broadly speaking, the range of climate in the Chinese culture-area is not unlike that in Europe. It is therefore not possible for anyone to say of China (as has been maintained in the Indian case) that the environment of an exceptionally hot climate inhibited the rise of modern natural science. 3 Although the natural, geographical and climatic settings of the different civilisations undoubtedly played a part in the development of their specific characteristics, I am in any case not inclined to regard this suggestion as valid even for Indian culture. The point is that it cannot even be asserted of China. Nonetheless here again we see the enormous importance of geography in relation to the civilisations and the way they developed. 4 Europe, as I have often said, is like an archipelago. revised for publication here. 2 If I were asked to define modern science, I would say that it was the combination of mathematised hypotheses about natural phenomena with relentless experimentation. On reflection, I am not sure that experimentation was not the greatest Chinese stimulus to European alchemy and so indirectly to the European Renaissance, for the Greeks did not experiment, but the Chinese did; otherwise they would never have made their fundamental discoveries such as porcelain and the magnetic compass. 3 Cf. the …	experiment;little big adventure;renaissance	Karl Tombre;Atul K.

Because of the beauty and majesty of auroral activity, people will seek information about when and where these unpredictable events occur. This activity, commonly referred to as nowcasting, can be combined with scientific data collected from observatories and satellites and serve as an early warning system with potentially far greater accuracy and timeliness than the current state of the art. We believe that long-term engagement with a citizen science tool will help bridge the many social worlds surrounding the aurora borealis and lead to the development of an early warning system that may correlate the visibility of the northern lights to violent space weather. We hope this will lead to other real time crowdsourced early warning systems in the future.	aurora;centralized computing;citizen science;crowdsourcing;mobile app;rare events;social reality	Andrea H.

The same electronic technology that lets readers transport a small library of books in an e-book reader, and access many more titles over the Internet, also may give new life to old, out-of-print titles, as well as to newer titles of modest appeal. Books that could not claim an audience sufficient to justify continued print runs and retail store space may well attract enough readership to warrant electronic delivery. E-books' digital search functions also facilitate study and analysis of any work, old or new. Alongside e-books' potential attractions for authors and readers, however, there persist troubling rights ownership questions for authors of preexist-ing works, and for the entrepreneurs with whom those authors might wish to contract. A recent controversy , Random House v. Rosetta Books, pits the original publisher of print titles Rosetta Books, an e-book publisher. Rosetta acquired from the authors' the rights to publish electronic versions of their works. Random House, their original publisher, claimed the authors did not have those rights to give: an e-book, said Random House, is still a book, and the authors granted to Random House the exclusive right to publish their works """" in book form. """" Random House also asserted that even if e-books were not considered to fall within the phrase """" in book form, """" they compete with print books, and authors signed a clause promising not to use any rights they retained in a way that competes with Random House's exercise of these rights as conveyed by the authors. Random House v. Rosetta Books, recently the subject of a preliminary ruling by a federal district judge in Manhattan, tests the scope of authors' grants of publishing rights in contracts negotiated before the e-book era. The case is an example of what copyright lawyers call the """" old license/new media """" problem: when a new mode of exploitation that might or might not come within the scope of the contractual language develops after the parties enter into the contract, who gets the benefit of the new medium—the author or the grantee?

The central argument of this chapter is that the possibility of strengthening systems of representative democracy through e-participation ini-tiatives depends on the strategies used to recruit participants into those initiatives. First a review of the theoretical discussion around strategies for the recruitment of participants and their normative implications for democratic legitimacy is pre-sented. This section is concluded with a framework of the possible strengths and weaknesses of different recruitment strategies in e-participation projects. Thereaf-ter, a broad empirical overview of e-participation projects is carried out, surveying the diffusion of different recruitment strategies in local e-consultations. This is fol-lowed by a case study of the European Citizens‟ Consultations (ECC). In the chap-ter‟s concluding discussion, lessons are drawn from the ECC case and a set of questions are formulated that should be considered in the design of e-participation projects related to the normative implications of different recruitment strategies.

This article uses evidence from the book-based social website Goodreads to provide a large scale analysis of 50 major English book genres based on author genders. The results show gender differences in authorship in almost all categories and gender differences the level of interest in, and ratings of, books in a minority of categories. Perhaps surprisingly in this context, there is not a clear gender-based relationship between the success of an author and their prevalence within a genre. The unexpected almost universal authorship gender differences should give new impetus to investigations of the importance of gender in fiction and the success of minority genders in some genres should encourage publishers and librarians to take their work seriously, except perhaps for most male-authored chick-lit.	book;coupling (computer programming);feedback;information source;librarian;text-based (computing);while	Mike Thelwall	2017	JASIST	10.1002/asi.23768	memoir	NLP	-84.28718748474795	-19.584811380582202	27034

A literature review on ERP and KM was conducted as the basis for a case study of the SAP implementation in one company within Aker Kvaerner, a global contractor of engineering services. The study indicates that the use of KM can make ERP implementations more effective by improving the knowledge sourcing ability among the implementation partners. Cost reductions and strategic business advantages are only some of the potential benefits of this. Several implications for practice were also identified, including the development of efficient communication routines in ERP implementations through improved knowledge transfer and reuse between the implementation partners.	erp;knowledge management;sap implementation	John Leknes;Bjørn Erik Munkvold	2006			enterprise system;computer science;knowledge management;process management	HCI	-80.8421688432513	3.6024819001660484	27059

fa2f5e0448a4286cf643a2cbe79c0e17b251aefe	annotum: launching a peer-reviewed journal online for free		Introduction In the second decade of the twenty-first century, creating a high-quality publication with rich content, beautiful design, and readership numbering in the millions has become easier than at any other time in history. Micro, mid-sized, and longform content can be produced and distributed free using tools such as Twitter, Tumblr, and WordPress, among many others. At the same time, costs and competitive pressures are rising in the scholarly publishing world, from open access mandates that require free distribution of content to increasing competition among journals and growing staff and review costs. And yet in the face of these two trends, the process of authoring and publishing scholarly journals remains an expensive, time-consuming process that can require significant up-front investment and technical expertise. Some electronic scholarly publishing systems exist, but they provide at best only rudimentary authoring tools, and tend to be very expensive and difficult to operate and maintain. It is as if the entire revolution in online, web-based content authoring and publishing tools has passed by the scientific publishing community. Annotum, an open source, open access, open process authoring and publishing system based on WordPress, was created to provide a simple and free tool to allow anyone to create peer-reviewed scholarly journals online.	open-source software;scientific literature;web content;wordpress	Carl Leubsdorf	2012	Learned Publishing	10.1087/20120204	computer science;peer review;knowledge management;public relations	HCI	-67.38773629720791	-21.418356614583228	27199

Cyberbullying manifests itself through the sending of embarrassing pictures, mean-spirited text messages, emails and/or postings on social media. Technology has exacerbated the problem by allowing bullying to be accomplished easily and anonymously. The problem of cyberbulling has been brought at the forefront of many colleges and high schools because it is spreading. Indeed, studies show that 39% of social network users have been victims of cyberbulling, compared with 22% of online teens who do not use social networks. Additionally, 88% of teens using social media say they have witness an instance of cyberbulling. Victims of cyberbullying experience negative emotional, physical and social consequences, sometimes leading to the victim's suicide.  This module aims at increasing students' awareness of cyberbulling while introducing game theory. Game theory is used to model the bully and the victim and exposes the student to various 2-player models (zero-sum, predator-prey, Nash equilibrium) and strategies that produce the best outcome. This module will be 6 to 9 hours long and will present a definition of cyberbullying, statistics about its prevalence, and research done to prevent and deter cyberbullying. Next, concepts of game theory relevant to modeling a cyberbully and their victim, as 2x2 games, actions, payoffs will be introduced. As regards to learning objectives, it is anticipated that students, who complete this module, will be able to use simulation software to model various game strategies to represent a cyberbullying situation.

Add a command and control structure — and here you are: A """"cyber army"""" of hijacked machines waiting for the commands of the so-called """"bot herder"""" ready to serve the master's will. Botnets may be used for distributing spam, for installing additional malware, for information harvesting, for distributed denial of service attacks and for other actions initiated and controlled by the bot herder. Today, thousands of botnets are well understood. Their actions are observed and in some cases controlled/limited. In addition, experts active in this field argue that there is a very large number of botnets escaping tracking efforts by mechanisms such as frequent reconfiguration and frequent migration of command-and-control structures. In his keynote, Peter Martini will comment on the challenge of detecting botnets, on aggregation and clustering of similar species of malicious software and on countermeasures used today. He will comment on the relevance of botnet size and the problem of measuring the current size of well-known botnets. Finally, he will comment on legal issues and missing pieces in the fight against botnets: Botnets have come to stay.

The global milieu of the New York World’s Fair 1939–40 frames the historical events that stimulated each of the student’s topics. To determine what each public library’s collection held about the world, the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) section of geography and travel (classification number 910) was used. Cross-referencing each library’s accession records for books added prior to 1945 against books recommended for all public libraries in the geography and travel (910) sections of standard professional guides like the ALA catalogs , the H. W. Wilson Company’s  Standard Catalog for Public Libraries , and other ALA publications like the  Guide to Reference Books  shows what students using these five libraries would have found. The recommended titles from the professional guides and those accessioned in the libraries indicate a distinct bias toward books concerning North America and Western Europe.	library (computing);public library	Bradley Wade Bishop	2012	Library Trends	10.1353/lib.2012.0018	library science;library of congress classification;computer science;engineering;media studies;dewey decimal classification;sociology;management;law;world wide web	Theory	-72.50411867177175	-20.344034621467717	27289
1d3d7fe2ef137f148906c87f40bea47ca1d37ede	legal problems of computer networks: a methodological survey	computer network	Abstract   To answer the question which legal problems are connected with computer networks, one needs to know first their future social consequences. But that requires an interdisciplinary “systems” approach, including prognostic methods and ‘irrational’ decisions. But which are the characteristics of computer networks? They combine very different social purposes with very different information technologies (a classification scheme of the latter is given). This leads to at least three levels of social problems coming up with computer networks: (1) ‘normal’ automation problems (disemployment, dequalification, etc.), (2) additional information automation problems (“privacy”, balance of information powers), (3) special computer network problems (e.g. transborder data flows — ‘information sovereignty’ of nations). Legal problems occur on all three levels, as is shown in detail. But none of them is really “new” — with the only possible exception of the urgent need of international regulations. The result is astonishing: No legal problem of computer networks seems to be unsolvable by common (interdisciplinary) legal work. But one deciding premise is undecided: which of the innumerable possible combinations of information technologies for c.n.s. will be reality? It is up to information politicians to publicly discuss and to decide. Where are they?	computer networks (journal)	Wilhelm Steinmüller	1979	Computer Networks	10.1016/0376-5075(79)90040-0	computer science;knowledge management;data mining;management science;computer security;computer network	Theory	-72.67311832142617	-9.144537795146512	27308

Using PayPal to accept payments has several advantages for online merchants. It is a recognized brand when it comes to Business to Consumer (B2C) transactions, creating a business account with PayPal is easier and faster, and finally, PayPal lends its name to the transaction, so customers may feel more comfortable entering into a transaction with a previously unknown merchant. Besides the mentioned advantages, PayPal’s transaction dispute system requires a tracking number from a shipped package to respond to a customer dispute. If the product is purely electronic (a download or access to a site, for example), one’s response to disputes will be quite limited. The solution for the problem mentioned above is PayPal API. The PayPal API resolves Pay Pal drawback through maintaining card and bank account payment schedules without the liability of warehousing payment data also processing one-time and recurring payments. For the evaluation of Pay Pal API, the authors develop an Event Registration Management System (ERMS). ERMS serves as a platform for users to make registrations for events such as conferences, seminars, and workshops. (B2C) transactions, creating a business account with PayPal is easier (and faster) than opening the merchant account required to accept credit card payments directly, and finally, because PayPal lends its name to the transaction, customers may feel more comfortable entering into a transaction with a previously unknown merchant.

The solution for the problem mentioned above is PayPal API. The PayPal API resolves Pay Pal drawback through maintaining card and bank account payment schedules without the liability of warehousing payment data also processing one-time and recurring payments. In this research, we first focused on Pay Pal API and explored the features of this technology. Consequently, we implemented an Event Registration Management System (ERMS) as case study to evaluate the performance of Pay Pal API in real system. 2. RELATED ELECTRONIC PAYMENT SYSTEMS There are different online payment systems on Internet. As stated in Chum (2004) some of the major online payment systems are as follows: MyCheckFree.com: popular electronic payment system that allows you to receive your bills directly to your email and pay any billers who are affiliates, including major department stores, clothing chains and even commercial banks. Paytrust: the most comprehensive online bill paying service that allows you to pay any bill electronically, even to billers that don’t allow electronic payment; PayTrust receives your bills, scans them, sends you email notification and allows you to access bills online for a year, plus keeps electronic payment records for eight years; but costs at least $5 per month plus 50 cents every time you receive or pay a bill, and is not compatible with Quicken. CCNow: shopping cart electronic payment system that accepts all major credit cards. ProPay: electronic payment system that processes credit cards through the Internet via touch-tone phones; used to make purchases at mobile businesses, trade shows/fairs and taxis. iKobo: electronic payment system that allows you to send and receive money in more than 170 countries. Moneybookers: electronic payment system that allows you to send and receive online payments in real time via email from your credit card or bank account. Authorize.net: electronic payment system, recently acquired by CyberSource Corp. that serves as the electronic payment gateway for businesses from sports entertainment and gourmet foods to government and religion. Chum (2004) studied the characteristics of the online payment systems using a set of criteria. Table 1 shows what the eight studied systems have in common and in difference according to the set of criteria. Used notations are as follow: 1 – The system has the attribute 2 – The system hasn’t the attribute 3 – we couldn’t identify information’s	application programming interface;database transaction;download;internet;management system;payment gateway;software engineer	Saeed Shadlou;Ng Jie Kai;Abdolreza Hajmoosaei	2011	IJWP	10.4018/jwp.2011040104	internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	ECom	-69.85572686969923	-13.997616521437424	27346

This study presents an extended technology acceptance and satisfaction model presented by Wixom and Todd (2005) that integrates technology acceptance and technology satisfaction into unified model to investigate what determines user mobile commerce acceptance and usage. The contributions of this paper are to extend and adapt the user satisfaction and technology acceptance model in an empirical study of 503 mobile commerce users, shedding light on the significance and relative importance of specific acceptance and satisfaction factors. This study validates the user satisfaction and technology acceptance model in business to customer mobile commerce context. The implication of this study to both researchers and practitioners is discussed.

According to the MC statistics, The ABI research predicts that in 2015, $119 billion worth of goods and services will be purchased via a mobile phone (ABI Research, 2011). Mobile Commerce Daily has also predicted that the mobile payments market for digital and physical goods, money transfers and near field communications transactions which have already reached $170 billion in 2010 is expected to quadruple by 2014, reaching $630 billion in value, although still only accounting for around 5 percent of total EC retail sales (Daily Mobile Commerce, 2011). MC known with its mobility and broad reach is a technological frontier and is an attractive area for research because of its relative novelty, rapid growth, and potential applications (Ngai & Gunasekaran, 2007). Although some authors and research firms believe that the demand for MC services will skyrocket and substantially extend current operations in EC in the future, unfortunately, many attempts in MC have so far failed to meet expectations, which have significantly slowed down the linkage between MC and Internet-based EC (Liang & Wei, 2004). Moreover, although there is a general notion in which mobile technologies can be applied in business, very little has been done in understanding how to improve business processes, what the implications of mobile technologies are, or what critical factors affect the success or failure of mobile technology applications (Liang et al., 2007). Therefore, it is extremely important to understand customer MC perceptions and acceptance since insufficient user acceptance has long been an obstacle to the successful adoption of new Information Systems (IS) and Information Technologies (IT). The technology acceptance research is a rich and mature field in IS research, yet its application in the MC context is in its early stages of development. It is very important to understand why promising technologies such as MC fail and what factors contribute to their acceptance and relevant success. However, to date, there is a lack of research on how users will accept to use MC in their daily business activities (Wu & Wang, 2005). Therefore, and given the specific characteristics of MC such as consumer privacy weaknesses and issues (Wei et al., 2006), we believe that research are needed to be robust enough to capture most, if not all, of the MC acceptance particularities. Accordingly, this study attempts to address these knowledge gaps by answering the following research questions: RQ1: Whether and how well user mobile commerce acceptance and usage can be predicted through incorporation of satisfaction constructs into technology acceptance model; RQ2: What are the determinants of satisfaction with mobile commerce at different levels? RQ3: How the value of quality MC can be transformed to higher MC usage through the mediating roles of behavioral beliefs and attitude?	acceptance testing;application binary interface;business process;consumer privacy;e-services;information system;linkage (software);mobile commerce;mobile payment;mobile phone;near field communication;quadruple-precision floating-point format;unified model;yang	Morteza Ghobakhloo;Sai Hong Tang;Norzima Zulkifli	2013	IJESMA	10.4018/jesma.2013010102	computer user satisfaction;knowledge management;marketing;commerce	HCI	-88.30769935248118	-9.208882334224018	27359

The study also examines the influence of subject domain and resource type in naming conventions. The study results evince divergence across metadata guidelines especially designed for resource and domain specific repositories. The naming conventions indicate that DC metadata semantics may be too broad to describe the characteristics of domain and resource specific repositories, unlike cross-domain and heterogeneous resource types. The employment of a high number of refinement qualifiers may engender a higher degree of semantic specificity for describing heterogeneous resource types. The study provides insights into metadata semantics in relation to resource type, subject domain, and refinement qualifiers. The study also brings forth insights for metadata planning, quality control, and interoperability.	best practice;qualitative comparative analysis	Jung-ran Park;Andrew Brenza;Caimei Lu	2015	IJMSO	10.1504/IJMSO.2015.074751	quality control;geospatial metadata;computer science;database;metadata;world wide web;data element;meta data services;information retrieval;metadata repository	HCI	-78.10939629652131	-11.543551761393795	27383

The study described involved the collection of quantitative and qualitative data through a national survey and a longitudinal multi-method case study within a communitybased healthcare organisation. The theoretical significance of this work is that it uses a thoroughly constructed research model, with potentially the largest sample size ever tested (2000+), to extend technology acceptance research into the health sector. Results provide support for the proposed model. This work reveals the complexity of the constructs and relationships that influence technology acceptance and highlights a need for reconceptualising current models. Results also demonstrate the importance of qualitative methodologies in information systems research. The significance and implications of the findings are discussed.	cross-validation (statistics);information systems research;information system;systems theory;the australian	Louise K.

d108fd51e3aa8d7b4ca8370dd292ce8a31a49b69	structure in scientific networks: towards predictions of research dynamism		Certain areas of scientific research flourish while others lose advocates and attention. We are interested in whether structural patterns within citation networks correspond to the growth or decline of the research areas to which those networks belong. We focus on three topic areas within optical physics as a set of cases; those areas have developed along different trajectories: one continues to expand rapidly; another is on the wane after an earlier peak; the final area has re-emerged after a short waning period. These three areas have substantial overlaps in the types of equipment they use and general methodology; at the same time, their citation networks are largely independent of each other. For each of our three areas, we map the citation networks of the top-100 most-cited papers, published pre-1999. In order to quantify the structures of the selected articles’ citation networks, we use a modified version of weak tie theory in tandem with entropy measures. Although the fortunes of a given research area are most obviously the result of accumulated innovations and impasses, our preliminary study provides evidence that these citation networks’ emergent structures reflect those developments and may shape evolving conversations in the scholarly literature.	citation graph;emergence;structural pattern	Benjamin W.

We conducted a laboratory experiment in which global virtual teams used IBM's Lotus Sametime to perform group tasks. We found that cultural heterogeneity of the virtual teams adversely affected members' perception of the group atmosphere, which in turn impacted the intra-group conflict in the teams. We also found that task conflict overshadowed relationship conflict in these teams. We studied conflicts that were manifested in the group discussions. The groups that performed a complex task manifested fewer conflict episodes than those working on a relatively simpler task. The findings of the study are interesting and provide motivation for future research.	lotus 1-2-3;virtual reality	Souren Paul;Sumati Ray	2010	2010 43rd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2010.266	simulation;computer science;organization;knowledge management;atmosphere;virtual reality;management;cultural diversity	Visualization	-86.94348846187482	-0.5970911987893674	27456

It is argued that traditional perspectives ignore participants’ everyday understanding of media use and media characteristics by relying on an individualistic and cognitive framework. The SIDE model, while improving on the definition of what may count as ‘social’ in CMC, still disregards the way in which identity is constructed and managed in everyday talk and text. To fill this gap, we offer a discursive psychological approach to online interaction. Presented here are the materials from an online discussion forum on depression. It is shown that participants’ identities do not so much mirror their inner worlds but are discourse practices in their own right. More specifically, we demonstrate how participants attend to ‘contradictory’ normative requirements when requesting support, thus performing the kind of identity work typically obscured in cognitive models.	cognitive model;computer-mediated communication;requirement	Joyce Lamerichs;Hedwig F.

The purpose of this study was to examine how this choice influenced viewers’ expectations of the content they were about to witness. Two hundred seventy-one students participated in a between-participant quasi-experimental study. After watching a YouTube video, one group of participants chose to watch a MP3 advertisement instead of an advertisement for a digital camera. The other group of participants was not given a choice and watched the same advertisement. Participants’ expectations were measured using six 7-point Likert items. The results of the study found that participants who chose to watch the MP3 option had significantly higher expectations of the upcoming advertisement than the participants who did not get a choice. These results parallel previous findings for female but not male online viewers. As a result, female viewers may go through a different series of cognitive processes when encountering advertisement choice compared to their male counterparts. Regardless of any cognitive differences, increases in advertisement expectations could potentially influence other important online marketing outcomes such as advertisement avoidance behaviors.

Structural equation modeling revealed that affinity (satisfaction with the major) was the most important factor in determining intention to leave the CS major. Unexpectedly, technical skills were the least important (compared to soft skills). Gender differences were also examined. Results indicate significantly different effects on affinity and intent to stay across gender. For example, when examining female CS students, both technical and soft skills were significantly related to affinity which in turn was significantly related to intent to stay; with soft skills providing the stronger relationship. For males, affinity for the CS major was only significantly related to emotional intelligence. Technical skills were not significantly related to affinity. The implications of these findings are discussed.	affinity analysis;processor affinity;structural equation modeling	Tracy L. Lewis;Wanda J. Smith;France Belanger;K.

While crowdsourcing as a phenomenon is studied in a variety of fields, research mostly focuses on isolated aspects and little is known about the integrated design of crowdsourcing efforts. We introduce a socio-technical systems perspective on crowdsourcing, which provides a deeper understanding of the components and relationships in crowdsourcing systems. By considering the function of crowdsourcing systems within their organizational context, we develop a typology of four distinct system archetypes. We analyze the characteristics of each type and derive a number of design requirements for the respective system components. The paper lays a foundation for IS-based crowdsourcing research, channels related academic work, and helps guiding the study and design of crowdsourcing information systems.	biological anthropology;crowdsourcing;information systems;information system;requirement;sociotechnical system;system analysis;system archetype;work systems	David Geiger;Michael Rosemann;Erwin Fielt;Martin Schader	2012			crowdsourcing software development;engineering;knowledge management;data science;data mining	Web+IR	-78.23389472006231	-3.232849641124074	27566

When content restrictions were removed from a question answering community and social technologies were introduced, the proportion of factual content on the site steadily diminished in favor of more social content: questions specifically about site users and appropriate behavior, suggesting an awareness of themselves as a community. Positive effects of self-aware behavior included increased site participation, social support and open normative debates. Negative effects included increased conflict, rogue behaviors and factionalism.	answerbag;critical point (network science);online community;question answering;rogue;self-awareness;sentience;social media;social support;spontaneous order	Rich Gazan	2009	2009 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2009.1025	public relations;question answering;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;marketing;database;participant observation;critical point;management;world wide web;online participation	HCI	-85.56676469420422	-18.04914470062599	27583

We conduct a case study in a large governmental organization in the United States. We capture multiple perspectives among the different groups in the organization and examine how this affects the design and implementation of security policies. We find a high interdependence between the information security group and other groups in the organization resulting in task and process conflicts. These conflicts had both positive and negative outcomes. A combination of dominating and compromising conflict management styles are shown to produce positive results in resolving the conflicts. Our study highlights the importance for managers to balance security and usability and to ensure that the stringency of security policies do not override the business objectives of the organization.	information security;interdependence;usability	Sherly Abraham;InduShobha N.

Most results confirm the trends in other research with R & D engineers: the use and management of information is rather improvised with low levels of sophistication. High tech information techniques (databases, online...) are only marginally important in this high-tech environment. Only younger engineers do some structured efforts. The general attitude is to rely mostly on oral, personal and occasional information sources. By combining positive attitudes and behaviour aspects towards information in the job, a measure of ‘information-orientation’ was constructed, which can be seen as an extension of the classical concept of ‘gate-keepers’ in a company. A few questions to reconstruct a ‘critical incident’ with respect to information problems reveal that information situations can be very time- and money-consuming but again solutions depend on occasional and unstructured information work. However the restricted written approach did not prove to be a good one for this kind of analysis. More in-depth interview-techniques will be necessary for analysis within the ‘critical incident theory’-frame.	database;information source;information theory	E. de Smet	1992	Scientometrics	10.1007/BF02016850	attitude;questionnaire;information;computer science;artificial intelligence;evaluation;personal information management;group information management;sociology;social psychology;operations research;theory;statistics	SE	-73.10915666836749	-22.356717755575467	27607

650c26ba104b21e5e5541943a46e417bdc22dc42	study of the influence of brand image on consumers' online shopping intention - - in the case of cosmetics		With the rapid development of science and technology, people’s acceptance of online shopping is increasing. As an important part of online shopping, small and medium-sized cosmetics enterprises have the characteristics of small investment scale and flexible adjustment of brand strategy, but previous research lack sustained and effective methods and tools to analysis brand impact. The paper takes INOHERB as an example, to explore the connotation and feature of brand and brand image from the perspective of the cosmetics online shopping, as well as the relevant theories of online shopping intention. Through literature review, the paper applies the bell brand image measurement model, dividing brand image into corporate image and product or service image, and user image. It also adds the analysis on the consumption characteristics, so as to test result reasonableness of the brand image analysis’s influence on online shopping intention. Data were collected from college female students by print questionnaires and online surveys. The result indicated that corporate image has a strong influence on consumer online shopping intention. Besides, product and service image also have a significant influence on consumer online shopping intention, consumers are more willing to buy cosmetics online above average prices with positive word of mouth and good quality.	image analysis;online shopping	Xinyan Liu;Sheng Zhang;Zhen Qin	2016				AI	-87.82123391414511	-11.208316014732686	27713
aa602b430684397da24e5bcf53582b6f2514237d	why do i publish research articles in english instead of my own language? differences in spanish researchers’ motivations across scientific domains	researchers motivation;non anglophone researchers;scientific domains;articulo;academic writing;publication strategies;research article	Previous studies have reported the increased use of English as the “lingua franca” for academic purposes among non-Anglophone researchers. But despite data that confirm this trend, little is known about the reasons why researchers decide to publish their results in English rather than in their first language. The aim of this study is to determine the influence of researchers’ scientific domain on their motivation to publish in English. The results are based on a large-scale survey of Spanish postdoctoral researchers at four different universities and one research centre, and reflect responses from 1717 researchers about their difficulties, motivations, attitudes and publication strategies. Researchers’ publication experiences as corresponding authors of articles in English and in their first language are strongly related to their scientific domain. But surprisingly, Spanish researchers across all domains expressed a similar degree of motivation when they write research articles in English. They perceive a strong association between this language and the desire for their research to be recognized and rewarded. Our study also shows that the target scientific audience is a key factor in understanding the choice of publication language. The implications of our findings go beyond the field of linguistics and are relevant to studies of scientific productivity and visibility, the quality and impact of research, and research assessment policies.

dfacea471b37cb177b8bf596325145132c12b669	google scholar and web of science: examining gender differences in citation coverage across five scientific disciplines		Abstract Many studies demonstrate differences in the coverage of citing publications in Google Scholar (GS) and Web of Science (WoS). Here, we examine to what extent citation data from the two databases reflect the scholarly impact of women and men differently. Our conjecture is that WoS carries an indirect gender bias in its selection criteria for citation sources that GS avoids due to criteria that are more inclusive. Using a sample of 1250 U.S. researchers in Sociology, Political Science, Economics, Cardiology and Chemistry, we examine gender differences in the average citation coverage of the two databases. We also calculate database-specific h -indices for all authors in the sample. In repeated simulations of hiring scenarios, we use these indices to examine whether womenu0027s appointment rates increase if hiring decisions rely on data from GS in lieu of WoS. We find no systematic gender differences in the citation coverage of the two databases. Further, our results indicate marginal to non-existing effects of database selection on womenu0027s success-rates in the simulations. In line with the existing literature, we find the citation coverage in WoS to be largest in Cardiology and Chemistry and smallest in Political Science and Sociology. The concordance between author-based h -indices measured by GS and WoS is largest for Chemistry followed by Cardiology, Political Science, Sociology and Economics.	google scholar;web of science	Jens Peter Andersen;Mathias Wullum Nielsen	2018	J.

Repeat investigations and comprehensive certifications by the U.S. General Accounting Office all report the same theme: more than sufficient knowledge existed to mitigate these events, but the knowledge was in a highly distributed and fragmented form across multiple departments, According to the knowledge-based theory of the firm, knowledge is the most strategically significant resource of an organization (Alavi and Leidner 2001; Argote and Ingram 2000). Capturing and sharing knowledge of expert and innovative employees provides a strategic advantage influencing performance outcomes (Nonaka 1994; Singh 2005). However, in order for distributed, heterogeneous knowledge bases to be intentionally leveraged as a strategic asset, an organization not only needs to identify what its employees know (and do not know) so it can appropriately target the transfer of knowledge, but also needs to discern when such knowledge will be valuable both now and in the future. To perform these feats with any certainty, an organization has to predict future events and knowledge needs.	failure;knowledge base;knowledge ecosystem;norm (social)	David Bray	2007		10.1007/978-0-387-72804-9_31		AI	-80.57009547323692	-2.8126687514994595	27766

The model tested was derived from the SeOeR consumer response model (Mehrabian & Russell, 1974) that depicts the effects of environmental/informational stimuli on consumer response. Specific research objectives were to investigate whether brand-related UGC acts as a stimulus to activate consumer behavior in relation to brand and examine the processes by which brandrelated UGC influences consumer behavior. Using the SeOeR model, brand-related UGC was treated as stimulus, pleasure and arousal as emotional responses, and perceived information quality as cognitive response. Information pass-along, impulse buying, future-purchase intention, and brand engagement were treated as behavioral responses. Participants (n 1⁄4 533) resided in the U.S. and had a Facebook account. Mock Facebook fan pages including brand-related UGC were developed as visual stimuli and presented via an online self-administered questionnaire. SEM was used to analyze the data. Brandrelated UGC activated consumers' emotional and cognitive responses. Emotional and cognitive responses significantly influenced behavioral responses. Positive brand-related UGC exerts a significant influence on brand as it provokes consumers’ eWOM behavior, brand engagement, and potential brand	information quality;mock object;social media marketing;user-generated content	Angella J.

We nd that teams with an equal gender mix perform better than male-dominated and female-dominated teams in terms of sales, pro ts and earnings per share. We explore various mechanisms and nd that mutual monitoring is more intense in mixed teams than in homogeneous teams. This partially explains the better results of mixed teams.

While this phenomenon has been the subject of numerous papers, there is still a lack of managerial tools that properly address the challenge of responding to this threat. This paper provides an in-depth review of recent developments in the field and, furthermore outlines a tool that supports managers in identifying forthcoming disruptive technologies and providing them with tailored strategic options. The application of this approach is illustrated by means of two case studies: the mass-market voice services and computing organised as a public utility.	strategic management	Roman Kopetzky;Markus Günther;Natalia Kryvinska;Andreas Mladenow;Christine Strauss;Christian Stummer	2013	IJGUC	10.1504/IJGUC.2013.054490	knowledge management;management science;computer security;strategic management	HPC	-74.34820511613695	2.698944005973314	27841

The U.S. and China voted against acceptance of the Sun application because they feared the consensus character of standards development would be reduced to achieve speed. Despite the objections about consensus, the need for speed has meant that the short-cut to JTC1 has attracted increasing attention and usage. Another approach to speed is manifested in the activities surrounding the standardization of Web information technology.

Many researchers throughout the world have been struggling with the issue of assessing SDIs. The task is difficult due to complex, dynamic and constantly evolving nature of SDI. As SDI can be treated as a Complex Adaptive System, the assessment should include strategies for evaluating those kinds of systems. One strategy is to use multiple assessment approaches and methods. The general evaluation research and experience provide additional motives for adopting such a strategy. We present the multiview framework for assessing SDI initiatives around the world, and argue that the strength of this assessment design lies in its flexibility, its multidisciplinary view on SDI and a reduced bias in the assessment results. The multi-view framework contains methods that not only evaluate SDI performance, but also deepen our knowledge about SDI functioning, and may assist in its development. The article presents the assessment framework and describes its theoretical grounding in complexity theory and evaluation research. The application of the framework is beyond the scope of this paper.	complex adaptive system;computational complexity theory;satellite digital imaging system;vagueness	Lukasz Grus;Joep Crompvoets;Arnold Bregt	2007	IJSDIR		engineering;knowledge management;data mining;management science	HCI	-76.71231388941754	-0.7802712832504365	27981

The Paris Commune, as this government became known as in the English world, attracted attention for its alternative political-economic organization. One notable commentator was Karl Marx who, while living in England at the time, commentated on the Commune as a test of the bourgeoning field of critical theory. This paper traces Marx’s work on the Commune, specifically in The Civil War in France, to examine how his work on this historical event underpins crucial concepts for critical pedagogy in contemporary adult education. While the trajectory between Marx’s writings on the Commune and critical adult education is underrepresented and often unacknowledged, I argue that there is an important connection: The Civil War in France revises Marx’s theory of dialectics in such a way that it allows us to understand informal learning as a process for possible critique.

The hypothesis was that homogeneous responses point to a philosophical approach whereas responses correlated with cultural background point to a moralistic approach.

The current research represents the first randomized controlled studies to directly compare both the social and emotional impact of social support provided in-person versus through text messaging. In two lab-based experiments, emerging adults completed a stressful task and were randomly assigned to receive emotional support either in-person, via text messaging, or no support at all. Support was provided by a close friend in experiment 1 (n = 64), and by a similar-aged confederate in experiment 2 (n = 188). In both experiments, in-person support was associated with significantly higher positive affect compared to text messaging. In-person support also led to greater satisfaction with support, but only in experiment 2. Overall, this research suggests that there may be emotional costs to a reliance on digital forms of social communication during times of stress.	instant messaging;interaction	Susan Holtzman;Drew DeClerck;Kara Turcotte;Diana Lisi;Michael Woodworth	2017	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2017.01.043	psychology;interpersonal relationship;communication;social psychology;world wide web;computer-mediated communication	HCI	-86.83487985377913	-19.534701829481236	28113

Thus it is necessary to investigate computational solutions that respect this diversity. The use of search engines is one of the main mechanisms to provide the access to information generated in the Social Network Services (SNS). These mechanisms are currently built through lexical-syntactical processing resulting in barriers for many users to access correct and valuable information in the Web. Novel search mechanisms could effectively help people to recover and use information through Inclusive Social Networks Services (ISN), promoting the universal access to information. This paper shows results of search activities in an ISN that point out how to improve search engines considering aspects related to social and digital inclusion. Inspired in these results, we outline an approach based on Organisational Semiotics to build Web ontology, which is used by an inclusive search engine drawn up in this paper. Actually, this proposal combines different strategies to provide better search results for all.	computation;digital data;experiment;freedom of information laws by country;heuristic (computer science);intel developer zone;international relations and security network;microsoft research;ontology (information science);population;programming tool;requirement;semiotics;social network;sonar;web search engine;world wide web	Júlio Cesar dos Reis;Rodrigo Bonacin;Maria Cecília Calani Baranauskas	2010			computer science;management science;social network	AI	-71.10252539761447	-18.15690605974349	28116

In this work we report on an effort to increase exposure to, and interaction with, a repository of health based information by coupling the repository with a social networking application. We hypothesize that we can sustain user interaction with a repository and increase nutrition knowledge through content browsing by reporting on the browsing actions of other users in a Social Networking System's activity feeds. We report on the findings of a live user study, which showed that coupling health content with a social networking system successfully increased content browsing and that highly engaged users are seen to have an altered attitude toward control over their health.	information access;usability testing	Jill Freyne;Shlomo Berkovsky;Stephen Kimani;Nilufar Baghaei;Emily Brindal	2010	2010 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS)	10.1109/CBMS.2010.6042666	multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web;social network	Metrics	-86.58462363477322	-17.75137777861839	28121

The major argument is that in today’s high-choice media environment, individuals and groups with the highest level of political interest are more likely to develop richer political information repertoires that involve exploiting both digital and traditional ways of searching for political information. Individuals and groups with richer political information repertories can be expected to have higher levels of political knowledge, efficacy, and participation. This article argues further that a clear connection exists between peoples’ informational and participatory repertoires and tests these propositions using a large, heterogeneous sample of the Israeli public during the 2013 election campaign. The analysis supports the claims of this study, with a few intriguing exceptions.

In the management, reconstruction of the discussion is important for planners and participants to share their understanding and to make better alternatives. In this study, we evaluated the effects of reconstructing the discussion by focusing on the change of participants' wordings during the discussion. This study proposed two types of methodologies: “Overlapping rate” and “Classification of noun words”. The former identified the characteristics of the participants. The latter showed the change of participants' wordings after the reconstruction.

This study was designed to expand previous research and conduct a comprehensive investigation on how social competence is associated with college students’ online dating behaviors, perceptions, and attitudes. Two hypotheses were tested: The social compensation hypothesis (SCH)—socially incompetent individuals would engage in more online dating, and the richget-richer hypothesis (RGRH)—socially competent individuals would use online dating more than their incompetent counterparts. The results showed that incompetent individuals, despite their ability to see benefits in online dating, did not show a favorable attitude towards online dating. They indicated a more frequent use of and a stronger preference for face-to-face dating compared to online dating, which contradicted the SCH. There were weak associations between competence traits and online dating behavior. Socially competent individuals perceived less benefit and showed less interest in online dating, which disconfirmed the RGRH. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	.sch;internet	Meredith E. M.

The JCR seems to have become more or less an authority for evaluating scientific and technical journals, essentially through its impact factor. However it is difficult to find one's way about in the impressive mass of quantitative data that JCR provides each year. We proposed the box plot method to aggregate the values of each indicator so as to obtain, at a glance, portrayals of the JCR population from 1974 to 1993. These images reflected the distribution of the journals into 4 groups designated low, central, high and extreme. The limits of the groups became a reference system with which, for example, it was rapidly possible to situate visually a given journal within the overall JCR population. Moreover, the box plot method, which gives a zoom effect, made it possible to visualize a large sub-population of the JCR usually overshadowed by the journals at the top of the rankings. These top level journals implicitly play the role of reference in evaluation processes. This often incites categorical judgements when the journals to be evaluated are not part of the top level. Our «rereading» of the JCR, which presented the JCR product differently, made it possible to qualify these judgements and bring a new light on journals.	aggregate data;content repository api for java;journal citation reports;thinking outside the box	Marie-Helene Magri;Aline Solari	1996	Scientometrics	10.1007/BF02018235	definition;epistemology;bibliometrics;scientometrics;computer science;evaluation;data mining;evolution;world wide web;multiple	Web+IR	-75.38192885090868	-21.81700821396842	28208

One specific case of study is represented by the collective attention to the action of political parties. Not surprisingly, researchers and stakeholders tried to correlate parties' presence on social media with their performances in elections. Despite the many efforts, results are still inconclusive since this kind of data is often very noisy and significant signals could be covered by (largely unknown) statistical fluctuations. In this paper we consider the number of tweets (tweet volume) of a party as a proxy of collective attention to the party, identify the dynamics of the volume, and show that this quantity has some information on the election outcome. We find that the distribution of the tweet volume for each party follows a log-normal distribution with a positive autocorrelation of the volume over short terms, which indicates the volume has large fluctuations of the log-normal distribution yet with a short-term tendency. Furthermore, by measuring the ratio of two consecutive daily tweet volumes, we find that the evolution of the daily volume of a party can be described by means of a geometric Brownian motion (i.e., the logarithm of the volume moves randomly with a trend). Finally, we determine the optimal period of averaging tweet volume for reducing fluctuations and extracting short-term tendencies. We conclude that the tweet volume is a good indicator of parties' success in the elections when considered over an optimal time window. Our study identifies the statistical nature of collective attention to political issues and sheds light on how to model the dynamics of collective attention in social media.	attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;autocorrelation;behavior;brownian motion;logarithm;performance;proxy server;randomness;social media;statistical model	Young-Ho Eom;Michelangelo Puliga;Jasmina Smailovic;Igor Mozetic;Guido Caldarelli	2015		10.1371/journal.pone.0131184	politics;interpersonal relationship;the internet;attention;social media;brownian motion	ML	-80.9445664366555	-20.086479259908337	28232

3406dc66bcc67f1a379627f5cb8d5e5f0604f25e	explaining online customer repurchase intentions from a relationship-marketing perspective: an integration of the 4rs marketing strategy and customer trust		Due to the low cost of searching for alternatives online, it is difficult to increase customer repurchase intention in the business-to-customer context. Relationship marketing (RM) is seen as an important way to foster customer trust, and in turn encourage repurchase intentions, which is consistent with the RM tactics-relational mediator-outcome paradigm in the offline context. Several studies have noted that the 4Rs marketing strategy both reflects and implements the concept of RM. This study thus examines whether RM-related constructs based on the 4Rs marketing strategy (i.e., assurance, customer satisfaction, perceived usefulness, corporate image, and perceived value) positively affect online customer repurchase intention; it also adopts trust as a relational mediator to investigate whether trust mediates the effect of the 4Rs marketing strategy on repurchase intention. The results of an online survey indicated that satisfaction, perceived usefulness, corporate image, perceived value, and trust were antecedents of repurchase intention. Additionally, this study statistically confirms that trust is a critical mediator of the indirect effects of RM-related constructs on repurchase intention. The theoretical and practical implications of this work are also discussed.

However, there is little research examining the impact of another information resource on VS adoption intention when recommendation information conflict occurs. This study draws on principle-agent perspective to investigate whether online customer reviews have potential to arouse users’ concern about information asymmetry and the fear of VS opportunism.

A critical success factor for community crowdsourcing is to attract online volunteer crowdsourcing users and engage their interest besides extrinsic motivators like monetary rewards. Our study examines determinants of participant engagement in online crowdsourcing communities, specifically motivation to contribute, personal interest in topic, and goal clarity. The results provide strong support for (a) the positive relationship between an individual’s motivation to contribute towards a task and their engagement towards that task; (b) the positive relationship of a person’s interest in the topic and their motivation to contribute; and (c) the partial mediating role of motivation to contribute. No significant effect was found for the hypothesis that clearer goals resulted in higher engagement since they led to a higher motivation to contribute when there was an inherent personal interest towards the topic.	crowdsourcing;emoticon	Triparna de Vreede;Gert-Jan de Vreede;Roni Reiter-Palmon	2017			public relations;motivation;computer science;knowledge management;internet privacy;crowdsourcing	HCI	-87.17356867515943	-15.708598393598947	28544

A method has been developed using quantitative analysis of content-words related to publications in order to: (1) study coherence of research topics within sets of publications citing clusters, i.e., (part of) the “current work” of a specialty; (2) to study differences in research topics between sets of publications citing different clusters; and (3) to evaluate recall of “current work” publications concerning the specialties identified by co-citation analysis. Empirical support is found for the claim that co-citation analysis identifies indeed subject-matter specialties. However, different clusters may identify the same specialty, and results are far from complete concerning the identified “current work.” These results are in accordance with the opinion of some experts in the fields. Low recall of co-citation analysis concerning the “current work” of specialties is shown to be related to the way in which researchers build their work on earlier publications: the “missed” publications equally build on very recent earlier work, but are less “consensual” and/or less “attentive” in their referencing practice. Evaluation of national research performance using co-citation analysis appears to be biased by this “incompleteness.”	citation analysis;co-citation	Robert R. Braam;Henk F. Moed;Anthony F.

The reports tend to be incomplete. They frequently lack fundamental information since they do not fulfill criteria’s of a scope and details. One consequence is that reports with inadequate information and do not fulfill requirements of analysts are transferred into the analysis process. To improve, the author designed a new structured incident reporting form, based upon witness psychology, interview, and questionnaire research with focus on analysts’ requests. This is the third experiment where they compared their new structured form to the form at present used in the Swedish Armed Forces (NATO standard). The two previous experiments showed significant enhanced results regarding quality of collected information, and that the new form could capture knowledge, regardless of the character or context of the incidents. The present experiment evaluates the form in a military context, and the significant result from an earlier experiment was replicated.

Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited. Why did it happen? and How can we prevent it from happening in the future? One way to acquire information about incidents is through pre-printed forms. In many organisations, incident-forms in paper or digital form are provided to all personnel to be used after incidents so as to facilitate obtaining the data necessary for the learning process. Unfortunately, a serious weakness in several organizations seems to be that many experiences are poorly reported or not reported at all (Dekker, 2007; Pettersson & Nyce, 2011; U.S. Army, 2009). Jennex (2008) stresses that some contributors do not have time to complete or submit their reports. Further Jennex (2008) argues a shorter template with common ontology would be preferable. However, that is not uncomplicated to realize, since it might include a diversity of organisations with different cultures, politics and terminology (depending on which the template are constructed for). US Army claims that despite high speed techniques and excellent storage possibilities, units often fail to preserve records of incidents during their mission (U.S. Army, 2009). To succeed in establishing the entire loop in the lessons learned process, organizations need to collect accurate knowledge regularly. “The importance of writing a good report cannot be overstated, because as good as the analysis results may be, they are worthless if you cannot successfully communicate them to others. Reporting is more than just writing things down, it is about conveying your message” (NATO, 2007, p. 98). Jacobson argues (2011) that reporting after an incident is vital in a learning organsiaton. He argues that learning will depend on how well an incident is reported, “...the ultimate learning will depend on how it is reported” (Jacobson, 2011, p. 21). Further he stresses that scope and quality of a report is most essential (giving it a weighting of 70%), for further analysis. In this case scope is yje aspects represented such as; description of the event, type of equipment/ item involved, damages, date and time, location, direct cause and contributing cause, name of reporter, etc., while quality stands for the level of detail of the aspects reported under scope (Jacobsson, 2011). At the Centre for Army Lessons Learned (CALL) one of the most important mission statements is collection of knowledge/unit operational data and the collection process in the US Army is pronounced the commander’s responsibility (Chua, Lam, & Majid, 2006; U.S. Army, 2009). That incident reports are poorly written was also confirmed regarding Swedish officers after their return from international missions (Pettersson, 2010). In view of the fact that reports obtained in the SwAF, frequently lack scope and details, they are by NATO standards considered raw. NATO makes a distinction between raw and mature reports. A raw observation is an observation that requires further analysis; meanwhile a so called mature observation already contains sufficient data and does not need further analysis (NATO, 2007). Today, the Swedish Armed Forces (SwAF) use a form/template recommended by NATO (2007, 2009, 2011). However, regarding the weak reports in the SwAF, we consider that the form is insufficient. This form provides the respondent with few headings and does not in fact facilitate or lead the respondent to write a ‘mature’ report. A serious consequence of this is that analysts receive inadequate foundation, which makes further analysis difficult or sometimes even impossible (NATO, 2007). Could the incomplete forms be due to the method with which the reporting forms were designed? Our hypothesis is that a structured incident reporting form will lead the writer to describe a more complete picture of the incident and write a mature report. If this can be fulfilled, reports will presumably be more useful in the analysis phase. We will present an experiment in which we compare our new structured, more detailed incident reporting form with the form at present used by deployed Swedish officers. 7 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the """"Add to Cart"""" button on the product's webpage: www.igi-global.com/article/new-incident-report-formleads/73017?camid=4v1 This title is available in InfoSci-Journals, InfoSci-Journal Disciplines Business, Administration, and Management, InfoSci-Civic Engagement, Sustainable Planning, and Crisis Response eJournal Collection, InfoSci-Management Science and Organizational Research eJournal Collection, InfoSciSurveillance, Security, and Defense eJournal Collection, InfoSci-Journal Disciplines Communications and Social Science.

This study investigates motives for its use, and its relationship to contextual age and narcissism. A survey of 239 college students revealed that the main reasons for Instagram use are “Surveillance/Knowledge about others,” “Documentation,” “Coolness,” and “Creativity.” The next significant finding was a positive relationship between those who scored high in interpersonal interaction and using Instagram for coolness, creative purposes, and surveillance. Another interesting finding shows that there is a positive relationship between high levels of social activity (traveling, going to sporting events, visiting friends, etc.) and being motivated to use Instagram as a means of documentation. In reference to narcissism, there was a positive relationship between using Instagram to be cool and for surveillance. Theoretical contributions of this study relate to our understanding of uses and gratifications theory. This study uncovers new motives for social media use not identified in previous literature. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A new reflexive discourse is emerging in the IS research community concerning how we, as academic scholars in the information systems field, set and pursue our research agendas. How should we choose our research topics, how should we conduct our research, and how should we communicate our research results? This panel will present and debate the merits of three distinct perspectives concerning the setting of our research agendas in information systems. There will be three short rounds of presentations by the three panelists: Richard Baskerville, Grandon Gill and Neil Ramiller. Following these presentations, Michael Myers (panel chair) will briefly summarize the discussion so far and give his own views with respect to the merits of the three arguments. After suggesting some key points for debate, he will then facilitate what promises to be an interesting and lively discussion with the audience.	ecology;information system;lively kernel	Michael D.

ca2b81e47df3155a0f7796d3191790516fd5756f	review of the politics of privacy by rule, et al		"""The development of the technical capability to implement very large scale data banks and EFT networks has occurred over the past two decades in concert with evolving social acceptance of many services based upon such technologies. In this climate of expanding technology and organizational influence in everyday life, conflicts have begun to escalate between institutional demands for information and social concern about the prudence of providing data in ever-expanding detail to powerful organizations. Rule and company's new book is at once a survey of thought on the dimensions of 'the privacy issue,' a perceptive critique of seven major documents underpinning contemporary privacy-related policies, and a provocative but disappointingly underdeveloped alternative approach to preserving and enhancing privacy and freedom. Much of the first half of _The Politics of Privacy is devoted to critical analyses of important works on privacy issues, including Westin's Privacy and Freedom , Miller's Assault on Privacy , the Report of the Privacy Protection Study Commission , and Westin and Baker's Databanks in a Free Society. Rule et al. find two themes running through current thinking about the problems of protecting individual privacy while satisfying 1 3 institutional information needs. First is the idea that particular technological changes (like databanks or EFT networks) somehow shift a preexisting """"balance"""" of social power toward the organizations controlling the technology and away from the individual subjects about whom information is recorded. Most analysts suggest that this balance shift can be mitigated by placing structural or regulatory constraints on what information may legitimately be collected and how it may be used. Thus, the Fair Credit Reporting Act specifies the purposes for which credit bureaus can issue reports, and the Privacy Act of 1974 places legal restriction on the disclosure of data from personal-data files. Only 'legitimate' uses of data are permitted, despite the technical and organizational capability for other uses. Second, most analysts usually assume that all parties in privacy debates share an interest in the efficient operation of com puterized recordkeeping systems. Moreover, the lack of efficient operation is the principal barrier to agreement among participants. It is hard to argue, after all, that innacurate personal data is any more useful to the organization which gathers and employs it than it is potentially damaging to the individual it describes. The more difficult privacy issues arise when inquiries are unpleasant, intrusive, and necessary to attain a goal, or when they serve useful …"""	credit bureau;electronic funds transfer;information needs;personally identifiable information;privacy act (canada);theme (computing)	Les Gasser	1980	SIGCAS Computers and Society	10.1145/957798.957800	public relations;public administration	Security	-72.35709536032638	-9.534824180534228	28628

Leveraging the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), the study proposes a framework to analyze the challenges consumers face in green consumption decisions. Challenges are identified in three dimensions: attitude formation, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control. This framework can be generalized to various consumption scenarios, and help researchers as well as application designers identify context specific challenges. The study then explains how IT applications/features may address the challenges. Social networking features enable individuals to go beyond their real world networks and connect with online friends who share the environmental concerns. Accordingly, the pool of relevant others changes, and individuals are more likely to be encouraged to consume environmentally friendly. Platforms of user generated contexts enable individuals to share their experiences and exert influence on others, and thus enhance individual’s motivation for green consumption. The conceptual arguments are illustrated with a case study on Seafood Watch, which demonstrates how IT helps with ocean friendly fish consumption.	experience	Yixin Zhang	2012			environmental economics;computer science;environmental resource management;socioeconomics	HCI	-86.25821233648064	-14.94062804093708	28691

Public servants have to face with the challenge of getting a job role specific knowledge, which is embedded into the processes or available in other unstructured sources, like in public policies. Even though much of government regulations may now available in digital form, due to their complexity and diversity, identifying the ones relevant to a particular context is a non-trivial task. Our paper will discuss a text mining solution to extract, organize and preserve knowledge embedded in organizational processes to enrich the organizational knowledge base in a systematic and controlled way, support employees to easily acquire their job role specific knowledge. The solution has been tested for the case of an agricultural service at public authority. The context of the case is sampling in controlling food safety and quality.	text mining	Saira Andleeb Gillani;Andrea Ko	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-10178-1_8	text mining;data science;data mining;information retrieval	NLP	-80.42413602789786	-4.131071267868222	28693

He suggests that in countries where the divide is falling, incomes will tend to be relatively high, and vice versa in the case of a rising divide. This relationship is examined on the basis of simple regression analysis; the analysis indicates the hypothesis is true with a high level of significance. Interpretation of the findings is carried out mainly in relation to countries from Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean. In short, recent changes in the digital divide are associated with global inequality rather than equality, although there are some important anomalies that need to be explained.	social inequality	Jeffrey James	2011	Inf.

The impacts of this revolution affect individuals, institutions, and governments-altering what they do, how they do it, and how they relate to one another. If individuals are to thrive economically and socially in a world that will be shaped, to a large degree, by these technological developments, they mast adapt through education and training. Already there is evidence of demands for new types of education and training, and of new institutions emerging to fill these demands.

This likely represents the initial attempt to perform analysis of such data by means of a machine learning technique. The variables employed include the gift amount to the university foundation as well as traditional demographic variables such as year of graduation, gender, ethnicity, marital status, etc. The foundation serves as one of the institution’s non-profit, fund-raising organizations. It pursues substantial gifts that are designated for the educational or leadership programs of the giver’s choice. Although they process gifts of all sizes, the foundation’s focus is on major gifts and endowments. Association Analysis of the given dataset is a two-step process. In the first step, FCA is applied to identify concepts and their relationships and in the second step, the association rules are defined for each concept. The hypothesis examined in this paper is that the generosity of alumni toward his/her alma mater can be predicted using association rules obtained by applying the Formal Concept Analysis approach.

On a global scale, sustainability is seen as depending on three systems: the global system, the human system and the social system. In the social system, the need to address issues of social sustainability, including literacy, education, malnutrition, child mortality, and gender empowerment, as well as its connections with human and global sustainability, has given rise to the eight Millennium Development Goals, which break down into twenty one quantifiable targets that are measured by sixty indicators. Therefore, it is clear that the problems and issues associated with the achievement of these goals are very complex to be addressed by a single discipline and that community informatics (CI) may have an important role to play in interdisciplinary efforts to address these goals. Against this backdrop, one of the first challenges is to put the notion of a social inclusion system (a system to promote social sustainability) in more precise terms. In this direction, the purpose of this paper is to discuss and present an initial ontology to describe social inclusion systems. While ontological development in sustainability science has emphasized a problem-solution approach, we believe that the issues of social inclusion will be more naturally addressed by a situation-transformation approach, which is the focus of our ontology.

The relative importance given to a particular factor may vary across gender. Thus, it generates a scope of inquiry for understanding the consumer behavior while making an online purchase. Hence, this article tries to understand the relative importance of the factors affecting consumers buying behaviors while shopping online. This article utilizes Fuzzy AHP and TOPSIS for finding relative weights of criteria and ranking of the alternatives available respectively. The results were analyzed for finding the relative importance of factors across gender. The article finds that security of transactions is the topmost priority for both males and females, but they put a different level of importance on rest of the factors. The results provide valuable insights which can help the online stores in prioritizing the important factors for future improvements.

We assert that firm size will influence the choice of payment method in global e-commerce. When a Letter of Credit (L/C) is used among global supply chain partners in the e-business setting, payment flows will move faster than the physical flow of products. This asymmetric speed is not preferable for importers, particularly small importers. In this case, the diffusion of e-business adoption will likely be upstream rather than down. We predict that the usance Letter of Credit and usance L/C payable at sight will become more popular as payment modes in global e-business, particularly for Smallto Medium-size Enterprises (SME).

4048b2f67fc2c3b6d3740a6d22e29048ae5ace48	using brand knowledge to understand consumers' intention to adopt an online retailer	brand knowledge;online shopping;perceived risk	It is important to draw attention about online retailing from a technological standpoint to a marketing perspective. The authors develop a conceptual model based on brand theory, risk theory and information theory to understand causal relationships among brand knowledge, perceived risk, online search action and intention to adopt an online retailer. The proposed model was tested in an online survey and structural equation modelling, a more powerful analytical tool, was applied to analyse the data. Results show that brand knowledge has a direct and positive effect on intention to adopt an online retailer and this effect can be mediated by perceived risk, to a large extent. In addition, perceived risk also positively relates to online search action. This model is sustainable for additional analysis after control variables, i.e., demographic profile variables, internet use frequency and risk preference are taken into consideration.	causality;control variable (programming);information theory;online search;online shopping;structural equation modeling	Rong Chen;Feng He	2003	IJSTM	10.1504/IJSTM.2003.003626	public relations;marketing;risk perception;advertising;brand awareness	AI	-88.94372423852627	-11.452437690387042	28976

Traditional scholarly publication through established journals characterized by peer review is being challenged by less formal net-based communication that links scholars essentially instantaneously. The contention is that universities need to preserve the benefits of the old system, in which the review process provides cohesion to a given field, while taking advantage of the speed and ease of access promised by the new media. This paper explores the Nigerian situation as it pertains to universities. The paper is basically descriptive and relies mostly on empirical evidences. It was revealed that because of the opportunities created by this new innovation, there is a burning and widespread desire to latch on this opportunity to increase the visibility of their intellectual output and productivity in the universities. The universities also face challenges in this respect which includes poor technology infrastructure, inadequate funding and lack of awareness amongst others. It is believed that if progress made so far is sustained with improvements on challenges the development, management and deployment of IRs will record tremendous success in universities in Nigeria.

Sometimes they apply it as a method and sometimes they apply it as a methodology. This different application stems from the debate between Glaser and Strauss; the originators of this theory. Some IS research implies the simultaneous use of case study and grounded theory. However, no conceptual/theoretical research for IS researchers yet specifies how grounded theory can be used as a method to be embraced within an interpretive case study strategy, to define a research methodology. This paper is therefore written to help IS researchers who are considering the use of grounded theory as a data analysis method in a manner compatible with the case study strategy, by first justifying the use of Strauss’s approach in this integration and secondly showing how this integration might be	icis;information systems	Mohanad Halaweh;Christine Fidler;Steve McRobb	2008			social science;grounded theory	NLP	-77.07380427367097	-1.4354065826629105	29060

Often organized as a virtual collaboration, these projects are a type of open movement, with collective goals addressed through open participation in research tasks. We conducted a survey of citizen science projects to elicit multiple aspects of project design and operation. We then clustered projects based on the tasks performed by participants and on the project's stated goals. The clustering results group projects that show similarities along other dimensions, suggesting useful divisions of the projects.	biological anthropology;citizen science;cluster analysis;social support	Andrea Wiggins;Kevin Crowston	2012	2012 45th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2012.295	scientific method;citizen science;human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;management;world wide web;collaboration	SE	-87.3096846162432	0.09254915856675613	29093

Drawing on expectation–confirmation theory and the IS continuance literature, we investigate whether, when and how software updates affect users' continuance intentions (CI). Based on a controlled laboratory experiment, we find a positive effect of feature updates on users' CI. According to this effect, software vendors can increase their users' CI by delivering features through updates after a software has been released and is already used by customers. We also find that users prefer frequent feature updates over less frequent update packages that bundle several features in one update. However, the positive effect from updates occurs only with functional feature updates and not with technical non-feature updates, disclosing update frequency and update type as crucialmoderators to this effect. Furthermore,we unveil that this beneficial effect of feature updates operates through positive disconfirmation of expectations, resulting in increased perceived usefulness and satisfaction. Implications for research and practice as well as directions for future research are discussed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Many advantages have been suggested for such experiences, including legitimization and more informed and transparent decisions. There are many conceivable variants of such processes. However, in most cases both its design and implementation are carried out in an informal way. In this paper we propose a methodology to design a participatory budget process based on a multicriteria decision making model. 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	participatory monitoring	J.

The purpose of this paper is to explore both social and gaming factors of social games and investigate their roles on enhancing perceived enjoyment. The authors also examine the relationships between perceived enjoyment, subject norm, perceived critical mass, intention to play, and actual behavior. Design/methodology/approach – This paper develops a research model including nine hypotheses. Using a survey questionnaire, empirical data were collected from 169 actual social game players. Structured equation modeling was used to test the proposed research models. Findings – Social identification, social interaction, and diversion significantly influence perceived enjoyment. Perceived enjoyment significantly influences the intention to play, which in turn significantly influences the actual behavior. Moreover, subject norm and perceived critical mass play different roles in determining the intention to play and the actual behavior. Practical implications – The results of this study provide social game practitioners with a set of rich insights into guidelines on designing specific social and gaming characteristics to improve users’ perceived enjoyment and actual playing behavior. Originality/value – Through analyzing characteristics of social games, The authors emphasize the difference between social games and other online games or computer games and recognize the enhancing role of social and gaming factors on perceived enjoyment. Findings of this study contribute to the literature on social games.	critical mass (sociodynamics);pc game;social network game	Aihui Chen;Yaobin Lu;Bin Wang	2016	IT & People	10.1108/ITP-07-2014-0156	web service;simulation;computer science;multimedia;sociology;web 2.0;social psychology;law;world wide web	HCI	-88.63209989350888	-13.611290207581225	29339

We appreciate his interest in and his undertaking a careful analysis of our work. We hope, in turn, that our responses will sharpen our discourse—to pinpoint more clearly where we agree and where we disagree. In the sections below, we first indicate briefly where we agree for the most part with Wyssusek’s arguments. We then address in more depth those areas where we are at odds with his views. Our goal is to debunk his arguments about how our work is flawed. Next, we address two matters that we see as incidental to Wyssusek’s and our respective positions. Nonetheless, these matters seem important to him in terms of his criticisms of our work. Finally, we provide some brief conclusions.	information system	Yair Wand;Ron Weber	2006	Scandinavian J. Inf.

It is a technique that requires the execution of a series of steps, many of them repetitive, which makes this technique time-consumi ng and error-prone. To address these issues, this paper presents an algorithm fo r aut matic selection of references based on both backward snowballing (from the lis t of references) and forward snowballing (finding citations to the papers). Our algorithm is especially useful for supporting the selection phase of a sy stematic mapping study, therefore it represents an effort towards a tool for fa cilit ting systematic mapping research. In order to assess its efficacy and efficien cy, we evaluated the algorithm in a set of experiments using data collected fr om a semester-long graduate course about Computer-Supported Cooperative Work ( CSCW).	algorithm;cognitive dimensions of notations;collaborative software;computer-supported cooperative work;cylinder-head-sector;experiment;iteration;precision and recall;seeds (cellular automaton);semiconductor industry;software engineering;systematic review	Fábio de Lima Bezerra;Carlos Favacho;Rafael Souza;Cleidson R.

Drawing on the self-determination theory and on the assumption that low levels of basic need satisfaction may relate to FoMO and social media engagement, the aim of the present research was to examine for the first time possible links between FoMO, social media engagement, and three motivational constructs: Intrinsic, extrinsic and amotivation for learning. Data were gathered from 296 undergraduate students by using the following scales: Social Media Engagement (SME), Fear of Missing Out (FoMOs) and Academic Motivation. The SME is a new scale, specifically designed for this study to measure the extent to which students used social media in the classroom. This scale includes three categories: Social engagement, news information engagement and commercial information engagement. Path analysis results indicated that the positive links between social media engagement and two motivational factors: Extrinsic and amotivation for learning are more likely to be mediated by FoMO. Interpretation of these results, their congruence within the context of the theoretical frameworks and practical implications are discussed. 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It examines articles published in Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly (JMCQ) between 2012 and 2014. The results indicate that the total online usage (full article and abstract page views and article downloads) can be a very strong predictor for citations and can even wipe out the effects of hot topics. Mobile and social media are the media of study most cited in the articles studied. There is no identifiable gender citation gap as authors of both genders equally enjoy their share in the top 10 most cited list. The only gender-related finding is that female authors dominate gender-related topics. We conclude that journal publishers wishing to obtain a quick proxy measure of citation potential for journal articles should consult their total online usage. Furthermore, due to the prevalent bias on topics regarding citation frequency, administrators and librarians are highly advised to take topics into consideration when determining scholars’ citation performance.	journal citation reports;kerrison predictor;librarian;page view;social media	Louisa Ha;Weiwei Jiang;Chang Bi;Ruonan Zhang;Tao Zhang;Xiaoli Wen	2016	Learned Publishing	10.1002/leap.1036	public relations;multimedia;world wide web	Web+IR	-81.04082158099175	-21.205736609594	29536

At the industry level, FOSS has gained increasing significance to commercial activity (Hyatt & Mickos, 2008). Projects such as Linux, Apache, and Mozilla have proven to be serious competitors for industry leaders (Asay 2013; Phipps 2012). Furthermore, the FOSS production model is steadily gaining ground in the production of information-based and cultural goods (Hahn et al., 2008) while the FOSS model of innovation is diffusing into a variety of other fields and industries such as technical design, pharmaceuticals, or biotechnology (von Krogh and Spaeth, 2007). It has also diffused into a wide array of domains, spawning commons-based peer production initiatives such as Wikipedia or OpenStreetMap.	linux;open-source software;openstreetmap;software development;wikipedia	Kevin Carillo;Jean-Gregoire Bernard	2015			internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	SE	-64.47283216367076	-8.703829939063644	29546

Why and how senior management came to make these decisions is the focus of this article. It explains the motivations behind Information Technology (IT) outsourcing when popular alliance theories, such as transaction cost theories, game theory and joint-venture alliance theory suggested firms would not outsource an entity if core competency would be lost. Seven case studies were used to investigate the IT outsourcing phenomenon in the observed ‘alliance-like’ relationships emerging in the banking industry in the early 1990s. Inductive theory generating research was undertaken in this work following Yin's (1984, 1989) guidelines of multiple case replications to ensure rigorous and systematic data collection procedures. Before the case studies were conducted, 40 preliminary interviews were undertaken with managers of companies that were and were not involved in IT outsourcing contracts to explore the theorized factors of interest drawn from the literature, to develop the propositions, and to refine a structured interview guide. These preparatory steps led into the initial case study, and the literal replications of the proposed factors to confirm the patterns found. A theoretical replication based on conflict resolution was then undertaken to expose greater variation in conflict with the outsourcing relationships to contrast the initial patterns found. The results suggest that financial motivations underlie many IT outsourcing decisions, and unresponsive IS departments are accelerating the pace of the outsourcing process. Within this research, IT outsourcing was found to have profound effects on the expenses for the banks. However, contrary to conventional wisdom, IT outsourcing is taking place within firms and industries which utilize IS activities that are considered core competencies. Several strategic motivations were presented that may explain this management decision. Firms were undertaking IT outsourcing to change the organizational boundaries, to restructure, to mitigate technological risk and uncertainty, to access emerging technology, to manage the IS department better, and to link business and IT strategy.	outsourcing	Kerry L.

7b12b39bc7c7dccc850980b8d1403747df493db5	an investigation into resistance practices at an sme consultancy	change management;employee participation;media;digital technology and the creative economy;owner managers;small to medium sized enterprises;social shaping of technology;design methodology	Purpose Prior research emphasizes that organizational founders have a good deal of influence in organizational development and, where ICTs are involved, a generic strategy is usually deployed by managers in order to deal with any resistance that might occur. Cognisant of this, we investigated the role played by a Managing Director of an SME consultancy in an ICT project associated with organizational development. Design/methodology/approach This study is based on an ethnography of a ICT related change management initiative which, theoretically, takes into account though from the social shaping of technology – speifically the idea that technologies in their broadest sense are subject to ongoing work beyond the design stage. Findings We argue that Markus’ Interaction Theory of resistance still has relevance today and we extend it by emphasizing the problem of homogenizing users and downplaying their ability to appropriate resistance strategies in situ. Research limitations/implications Our study is based upon one group of individual’s experiences. Further case studies of resistance success are required which further highlight how such this is achieved and why. Practical implications Those engaged with organisational development projects need to be better educated as to the reasons for resistance, particularly positive ones, and the methods by which this might take place. Originality/value This study conceptualises strategies for ‘overcoming’ resistance as managerial technologies. Conceptualising them in this way, shows the deployement of such technologies to be a complicated and active process where the audience for such things are involved in how they are received and appropriated to suite differing agendas.	change management (engineering);noise shaping;relevance;social constructivism	Marie Griffiths;Ben Light	2009	J.

The (information) security infrastructure comprises entities, processes, and technology. All are participants in handling information, which is the item that needs to be protected. Privacy and security information technology is a critical and unmet need in the management of personal information. This paper proposes concepts and technologies for management of personal information. Two different types of information can be distinguished: personal information and non-personal information. Personal information can be either personalidentifiable information (PII), or non-identifiable information (NII). Security, policy, and technical requirements can be based on this distinction. At the conceptual level, PII is defined and formalized by propositions over infons (discrete pieces of information) that specify transformations in PII and NII. PII is categorized into simple infons that reflect the proprietor’s aspects, relationships with objects, and relationships with other proprietors. The proprietor is the identified person about whom the information is communicated. The paper proposes a database organization that focuses on the PII spheres of proprietors. At the design level, the paper describes databases of personal identifiable information built exclusively for this type of information, with their own conceptual scheme, system management, and physical structure.

For this purpose, we analyze Spanish scientific output published in Spanish journals (covered by the ICYT database), as well as in international journals (covered by theScience Citation Index), during the period 1980–1995. Congress and conference publications, books and monographs, are also considered. The following changes in publication habits have been noticed: migration of works towards SCI journals and increased use of books and monographs as channel of publication of research works. A decreasing participation of Spanish researchers in scientific meetings has also been noticed, especially since 1989.	book;channel (communications);citation index;journal citation reports	Jesús Rey;María-José Martín;Luis Plaza;Juan-José Ibáñez;Isabel Méndez	1998	Scientometrics	10.1007/BF02457971	sociology;management;operations research;spanish;behavior	HPC	-74.97365992792137	-22.341514923626274	29733

Free2Ride aimed at developing a piece of ICT safety equipment consisting of a sender (on the horse) and a receiver (application in a smartphone) to be used by equestrian club members during their everyday riding activities. We will answer the research question of what the characteristics of a boundary dialogue in user-centric innovation activities are. The aim of the paper is to propose a model describing the characteristics of boundary dialogue in user-centric innovation that involve different communities of practices such as ICT developers, users and researchers. We applied a combination of research approaches consisting of action research and engaged scholarship approach. The theoretical framework for analyzing our findings is communities of practices with a specific interest in boundary spanning and learning dialogues. Our contribution is a model describing the characteristics of boundary dialogues in user-centric innovation. An important element of that model is the mental wandering, inwards and outwards, by core members in a community. We discuss the temporal as well as the symbolic nature of the mental wandering during the boundary dialogue in user-centric innovation activities.

On the basis of two experiments, we test whether individuals who witness cyberbullying are less willing to intervene when the number of others who have already observed the incident is increased. In addition, we inquire how differently severe cyberbullying incidents affect bystanders’ intention to intervene. Our results show that a very severe cyberbullying incident boosts individuals’ intention to intervene, mediated by the assessment of the situation as emergency and, in turn, by an increased feeling of responsibility. However, if there is a larger number of bystanders in a cyberbullying incident, rather than just a few, participants feel less responsible to help, and thus, they are less willing to intervene.	cyberbullying;experiment	Magdalena Obermaier;Nayla Fawzi;Thomas Koch	2016	New Media & Society	10.1177/1461444814563519	psychology;public relations;advertising;social psychology;bystander effect	HCI	-87.79708515122755	-18.38694315264163	29878

Today, however, information technology is increasingly changing the process by which strategic pricing decisions in firms are made and implemented in business operations. This creates the impetus for developing a more substantial managerial understanding of firm pricing processes in the presence of information technology. In the 1990s, technology-driven pricing was largely the domain of the airlines, hotels and rental car companies - with the practice of revenue yield management. However, now it is possible for bricks-and-clicks firms, and even traditional retailers, to implement systems that permit significant adjustments to be made to prices in situations where menu costs previously made rapid price changes difficult to achieve in an economical way. The paper draws upon theoretical perspectives that are largely new to the field of information systems, but that offer rich opportunities for theory-building and empirical research in settings that are of high interdisciplinary interest.	bricks and clicks;information system	Robert J.

First, the authors outline two knowledge management strategies as well as the notion of project manager. The authors concentrate on the project managerâ€™s knowledge creation and communication using the so-called theatre metaphor for conscious experience. According to this metaphor, the human brain and consciousness work together like a theatre. With the help of the metaphor, the authors describe and attempt to understand important aspects of the project managerâ€™s mental action in the above tasks.		Kaj U.

The last half of the twentieth century has witnessed a considerable acceleration of the integration of technological elements, Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) into the means of economic production in particular, and social life in general. This article aims to address the methods and practices by which we can effectively open the currently closed cognitive framing of those involved in making ethical governance decisions. This can be done by introducing a second-order reflexivity to allow for accountability and participation in a governance strategy that enables real effectiveness of ethical norm expression in technological projects. This paper draws on the Louvain school of theory of Lenoble and Maesschalk (cf. especially 2006) [10]. The paper’s two authors are both involved in the EGAIS and ETICA EU FP7 projects where they are further developing and testing out the approach outlined in order to establish an effective ethical governance approach for future European cofinanced technology projects.	feedback;framing (world wide web);framing (social sciences);futures studies;louvain modularity;proposed directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions;semantics (computer science)	Philippe Goujon;Catherine Flick	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-15479-9_9	knowledge management;political science;socioeconomics;management	SE	-77.8060419755773	-8.263306825381903	29941
23d78cb65f704a77d852dfb412e9603408ccc118	escalation of commitment: a longitudinal case study of daily meetings		Abstract. Escalating commitment is a common and costly phenomenon in software projects in which decision-makers continue to invest resources to a failing course of action. We conducted a longitudinal case study exploring the effect of daily meetings on escalating commitment. This was done in an agile project building software for the oil and gas industry. By analyzing data collected over a period of four years, and drawing on concepts from self-justification theory we found that daily meetings contributed to maintain a situation of escalating commitment. This especially occurs if the meeting becomes a place for reporting and defending decisions with team members feeling that they have to justify their choices towards the project management or fellow team members. Early signs of escalation such as rationalizing continuation of a chosen course of action must therefore be taken seriously. Keywords: Escalating commitment, daily meetings, stand-up, Scrum, self-justification theory, agile software development.	privilege escalation	Viktoria Gulliksen Stray;Nils Brede Moe;Tore Dybå	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-30350-0_11	public relations;engineering;operations management;escalation of commitment;management	HCI	-82.86529890479869	-0.336669466577613	30003

The aim of the review is not to solely discuss Facebook in relation to teaching or learning purposes, or about its educational value per se, but also to present a detailed account of the participants' Facebook usage profile or the extent to which users are engaged in Facebook activities. The emphasis of this review will be upon empirical findings rather than opinion- or theoretical explanations. Following the review guidelines set by Creswell (Research Design Qualitative and Quantitative Approaches, 1994), I summarize the hitherto accumulated state of knowledge concerning Facebook and highlight questions or issues that research has left unresolved. This review is organized into three sections that cover the major topics of current research: (a) students' Facebook usage profile or extent of Facebook use (e.g., time students spend on Facebook each day, students' motives for using Facebook, as well as various factors that may affect these usage profiles), (b) the effects of Facebook use (e.g., effects of Facebook self-disclosure on teacher credibility, effects of Facebook use on student social presence and discussion, and effects of Facebook on students' academic performance), and (c) students' attitudes toward Facebook. The conclusions overall suggest that Facebook thus far has very little educational use, that students use Facebook mainly to keep in touch with known individuals, and that students tend to disclose more personal information about themselves on Facebook; hence attracting potential privacy risks upon themselves.

10f7b5d75438eaf55ea581c3759e914ce0d004a1	toward identification and adoption of best practices in algorithmic recommender systems research	research guidelines;evaluation;recommender systems	One of the goals of data-intensive research, in any field of study, is to grow knowledge over time as additional studies contribute to collective knowledge and understanding. Two steps are critical to making such research cumulative -- the individual research results need to be documented thoroughly and conducted on data made available to others (to allow replication and meta-analysis), and the individual research needs to be carried out correctly, following standards and best practices for coding, missing data, algorithm choices, algorithm implementations, metrics, and statistics. This work aims to address a growing concern that the Recommender Systems research community (which is uniquely equipped to address many important challenges in electronic commerce, social networks, social media, and big data settings) is facing a crisis where a significant number of research papers lack the rigor and evaluation to be properly judged and, therefore, have little to contribute to collective knowledge. We advocate that this issue can be addressed through development and dissemination (to authors, reviewers, and editors) of best-practice research methodologies, resulting in specific guidelines and checklists, as well as through tool development to support effective research. We also plan to assess the impact on the field with an eye toward supporting such efforts in other data-intensive specialties.	algorithm;best practice;big data;data-intensive computing;e-commerce;missing data;recommender system;social media;social network;systems theory	Joseph A.

614429d1ff2235d149f57463fcf041683b39dbfe	the ethics of outsourcing online survey research	online survey	The increasing level of Internet penetration over the last decade has made web surveying a viable option for data collection in academic research. Software tools and services have been developed to facilitate the development and deployment of web surveys. Many academics and research students are outsourcing the design and/ or hosting of their web surveys to external service providers, yet ethical issues associated with this use have received limited attention in academic literature. In this article, the authors focus on specific ethical concerns associated with the outsourcing of web surveys with particular reference to external commercial web survey service providers. These include threats to confidentiality and anonymity, the potential for loss of control over decisions about research data, and the reduced credibility of research. Suggested guidelines for academic institutions and researchers in relation to outsourcing aspects of web-based survey research are provided. collection efforts ‘online’ (Lee, Fielding, & Blank, 2008; Reips, 2007; Skitka & Sargis, 2006). These efforts have variously involved online interviewing (Hewson, 2007; O’Connor, Madge, Shaw, & Wellens, 2008), observation and other non-reactive methods (Janetzko, 2008; Robinson, 2001), experimentation (Birnbaum, 2007; Reips, 2007) and web surveying (Best & Krueger, 2008; Reips, 2008). Of these online data collection methods, web surveying is currently dominant (Reips, 2008), is continuing to grow in popularity (Lee et al., 2008)1, is the online method most frequently reviewed by Human Research Ethics Committees (HRECs; Buchanan & Hvizdak, 2009) and thus is the primary focus of this paper.

Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited. The growing use of web surveying merits attention to the possible impacts of the technology on research participants. Such ethical considerations are situated within the emerging scholarship on technoethics. Technoethics provides a focus on the ethical considerations associated with technological change (Luppicini, 2009). Within the broad field of technoethics, Internet ethics and cyber ethics have been identified as key areas (Luppicini, 2009) with major questions including “What are the ethical responsibilities of Internet researchers to research participants?” (p. 10) and “What are the ethical responsibilities of Internet researchers to protect the identity and confidentiality of data derived from the Internet?” (p. 10). We begin this article by providing an overview of web surveying, including the tools and services that have emerged to facilitate the development and deployment of web surveys. We provide evidence to suggest that commercial web survey hosts are widely used by academic researchers, yet the ethical issues associated with this use have received only limited attention in the academic literature. The main body of this article provides a focus on specific ethical concerns associated with outsourcing aspects of the web surveying process, with particular reference to external commercial web survey hosts. These include threats to confidentiality and anonymity associated with breaches of data protection and the potential loss of control over decisions about the data. Further, the possible impact of externally hosting academic surveys on response rates and responding is examined in terms of online privacy concern and the perceived credibility of research. This article concludes with some suggested guidelines for institutions and researchers in relation to the outsourcing of aspects of academic research utilising web surveys.

c4675d6bd999fd9b8e053ad567c324604df26ea4	intellectual property reform for the internet generation. an accident waiting to happen		In July 2009, whilst delivering the 2009 Ludwig Erhard Lecture (The Lisbon Council's flagship event), EU Commissioner for Telecoms and Media Viviane Reding (2009) posed the following question: 'Does our present legal system for Intellectual Property Rights really live up to the expectations of the internet generation?' For a generation for whom 'Electronic life' is a reality, is our present European regime of intellectual property fit for such an age ? The UK Gowers Review (2005) on Intellectual Property when asked whether UK intellectual property law was fit for purpose in an era of globalisation, digitisation and increasing economic specialization had answered with a qualified 'yes'. The precision found in Gowers has, however, been lacking in the subsequent stages of reform. Whilst the Digital Britain Report carried through the precision Gowers several sets of consultations and reports in the UK and EU have muddled the debate and have hindered the process of coherent reform. This paper will argue that the reform agenda has lost focus on what are the appropriate aims and objectives for intellectual property in the digital age. In apparently ignoring the lessons of recent history and contemporary economic evidence these proposals have become preoccupied with the vested rights of one group of stakeholders (rights holders), and have ignored the rights of consumers and other follow on users. As such they will lead to an increasing alienation between rights holders (and their performers and creators) and their users/consumers and so stand in contradiction to other strategies including the growing of the digital economy. Such failings have had a significant effect on innovation and culture within music, leading to the stifling of new musical genres and of the means to acquire and distribute music. Lessig (2004) refers to this process as the locking down and appropriation of culture. The record industry as a result fails to provide variety, diversity and choice at a time when interest and usage in music is increasing.

We compare it to the double round-robin tournament which is the most prevalent league format among European leagues. In a simulation study we show that the new league format has better ability to determine the strongest competitor as the winner of a league as well as it yields higher correlation with theoretical latent teams’ strength parameters in the model.	round-robin scheduling;simulation	Jan Lasek;Marek Gagolewski	2015			league;football;advertising;political science	Web+IR	-79.99477790331119	-21.159321004537887	30259

However, practical solutions remain elusive and tend to exhibit underlying conflicts between different paradigms and their associated methodologies. This paper argues the need to wield analytical tools that themselves embody the principles of systemic, ecological thinking. We present here a theoretical framework based on complexity science – focused on organisational and second order cybernetics – that highlights our understanding of the concept of sustainability. The paper goes on to reflect upon how current practice would benefit from such an approach. 2007 Elsevier B.V.

As such its electoral processes still needs to be nurtured and protected. Since 1994 there has been four national elections. All of these have been declared ”free and fair” by the Independent Electoral Commission. However, there has been some problems and growing pains. This paper firstly discusses the current electoral system in South Africa. It then examines E-voting systems and discusses the feasibility of such a voting system for use in the South African context.		Eloïse Swanepoel;K. Thomson;J.

2bf682b7113ca4e388624085aded721a5a97702d	a comparative study of campaign blogs and web sites: the case of taiwan's 2008 general election	elections;potential difference;communication model;content analysis;internet;taiwan;public sphere;political communication;political culture;communication pattern;design methodology	Purpose – The blogging phenomenon has become a primary mode of mainstream communication for the Web 2.0 era. While previous studies found that campaign web sites did not realise two-way communication ideals, the current study aims to investigate potential differences in communication patterns between campaign blogs and web sites during Taiwan’s 2008 general election, with the aim of exploring whether the blogging phenomenon can improve the process of online political communication. Design/methodology/approach – The study used a content analysis approach, the web style analysis method, which was designed specifically for analysing web content, and applied it to an online campaign context in a different political culture, using Taiwan’s general election as a case study. Findings – Results indicated that the themes of both campaign blogs and web sites focused on “attacking opponents” rather than focusing on political policies or information on particular issues. However, campaign blogs and web sites significantly differed in all other dimensions, including structural features, functions, interactivity and appeal strategies. Overall, in terms of the online democratic ideal, campaign blogs appeared to allow more democratic, broader, deeper and easier two-way communication models between candidates and voters or among voters. Research limitations/implications – The current study focused on candidates’ blogs and web sites and did not explore the other vast parts of the online political sphere, particularly independent or citizen-based blogs, which play significant roles in the decentralised and participant-networked public spheres. Originality/value – The study illuminates the role of hyperlinks on campaign blogs. By providing a greater abundance of external links than campaign web sites, campaign blogs allowed more voters, especially younger ones, to share political information in a manner that is quite different from the traditional one-way communication model. The paper also argues that interactivity measures should be incorporated into the web style analysis method.	blog;hyperlink;interactivity;mediawiki;one-way function;online advertising;web 2.0;web content;world wide web	Tai-Li Wang	2010	Online Information Review	10.1108/14684521011036963	election;political communication;voltage;the internet;models of communication;design methods;content analysis;multimedia;political culture;law;world wide web	Web+IR	-82.67010168451793	-15.637250555156703	30354

The ESLA team is investigating collaborative social learning within the Australian Defence Organisation (ADO). Social learning is tightly coupled to knowledge management. Three studies in three different settings have been conducted to date. The studies have provided multi-layered findings about social learning, and validated the use of ethnography for this purpose. Preliminary findings arc discussed in this paper in terms of identified enablers and motivators for effective social learning and knowledge management. Although the paper deals with the defence environment, the findings can be generalised to other organisational settings, as the study deals with understanding the issues inherent in building sustainable and adaptive learning organisations.

Media Richness and Social Cognitive theories propose that rich media offer more information with interactive and audible visual content, which could have a significant impact on people's thinking and behavior. The objective was to determine whether USMO presented by rich media has an influence on at-risk sexual behavior for HIV/AIDS. Two hundred young people participated in the study, and it was found that USMO from rich media is connected to at risk sexual behavior for HIV/AIDS (p<.01). Young people who use rich media for masturbation (F[2,189]=10.169, p<.001), arousal (F[2,189]=4.686, p<.05), stimulation (F[2,189]=8.382, p<.001), and seeking adventures (F[2,189]=6.406, p<.01) were more likely to show at risk sexual behavior for HIV/AIDS. The study also found that young people may experience pleasure from USMO in rich media and feel motivated to model what they observe.	arousal;hiv infections;interactive media;masturbation;physiological sexual disorders;theory	Raquel A.

404d0481c6d07d022dd70193768fdbc72d8e713c	internet village motoman project in rural cambodia: bridging the digital divide		PurposernrnrnrnrnCommunity wireless networking has become a growing trend in both metropolitan and rural areas around the world. However, few studies have sought to understand what motivates people to use community wireless networks and the unintended effects that those technologies have on communities, particularly for rural users. The purpose of this paper is to explore the benefits and usage of an asynchronous wireless internet system in a rural village of Cambodia to examine the issues and challenges in the acceptance of a new technology in a less-developed country.rnrnrnrnrnDesign/methodology/approachrnrnrnrnrnBy employing qualitative methods of in-depth case analysis, the authors revealed various usage motivations and unintended effects of the system.rnrnrnrnrnFindingsrnrnrnrnrnThe authors identified five reasons that motivated users to use the system: avowed identity, a means to an end, maintaining personal ties, power and influence, and psychological commitment and ownership. The unintended effects of the system included increased number of interactions among actors and other uses of the system, including internet commerce, telemedicine, and e-government.rnrnrnrnrnResearch limitations/implicationsrnrnrnrnrnThis study explores the wireless internet project known as the “Internet Village Motoman Project” that was initiated by a non-governmental organization with funding from private donors, supplemented with matching funds from the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank.rnrnrnrnrnOriginality/valuernrnrnrnrnThis study contributes to the academic understanding of rural regions of Cambodia and its evidence supports the current theoretical assumptions that user behaviors are not determined only by users’ decisions alone (as proposed by traditional cognitive IS research), but also by users and their social interactions as stated in the four-dimensional social actor framework proposed by Lamb and Kling (2003). The latter provides better explanation of the motivation for internet use in the region. The theoretical contribution of this study is the useful adoption of the actor-network approach in a non-organizational setting. The findings also contribute to the literature on how practical internet engineering can bridge the digital divide. Fulfilling the needs identified in the research and understanding unintended effects of the system will contribute to the successful implementation of new internet projects in other rural areas.	bridging (networking)	Margaret Meiling Luo;Sophea Chea	2018	IT & People	10.1108/ITP-07-2016-0157	wireless network;knowledge management;rural area;engineering;digital divide;actor–network theory;the internet;telemedicine;developing country;qualitative research	HCI	-80.55341726308758	-8.368662510041222	30626

Using stakeholder theory for conceptualizing urban life, we install nature as both an omnipresent stakeholder and an issue to be continuously addressed and related to. From this perspective we explore how the citizen enacts his relations to the natural environment in an urban setting and how digital media facilitate different forms of relations. Conceptually framed within stakeholder management theory and models on why corporations engage in corporate social responsibility we use The Aarhus CO2030 exhibition (specifically a digital installation entitled CO2mmitment/CO2nfessions) as an exemplary case to provide insights into understanding drivers for citizens' climate conscious behavior. Based on our study we argue that citizens face similar challenges and conflicting behaviors as corporations in response to the climate change.	digital media	Anne Ellerup Nielsen;Sophie Esmann Andersen	2010	2010 43rd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2010.106	public relations;media;risk management;organization;environmental resource management;marketing;digital media;natural environment;climate change;management;law;stakeholder theory;corporate social responsibility	HCI	-74.58372255691147	-7.005130375486192	30636

Several factions of the profession are beginning to respond aggressively, leading to notable successes in such areas as financial services, electronic markets, network infrastructure, packaged OR-software tools, supply-chain management, and travel-related services. Because OR is well matched to the needs of the digital economy in certain ways and because certain enabling conditions are coming to pass, prospects are good for OR to team with related analytic technologies and join information technology as a vital engine of further development for the digital economy. OR professionals should prepare for a future in which most businesses will be e-businesses. W e may be living through the business equivalent of the Cambrian explosion when, after 3.5 billion years of sluggish evolution, a vast array of life forms suddenly appeared in only 10 million years. New business models and ways of organizing and operating businesses are appearing in comparably rapid profusion, driven by stunning advances in the information technologies. As managers pursue organizational change on a massive scale, they have fo-cused to the point of preoccupation on the opportunities presented by modern information technology. The need for more decision technology has been growing all the while, but only recently have competitive pressures begun to build for more applications. Fortunately, new data sources, operational business software, intermediaries, and data-exchange standards are emerging that are very conducive to decision technology. Thus the digital economy is entering a phase in which decision technology seems poised to rise and join information technology as a vital engine of further development. What kinds of opportunities does the dawning e-business era offer OR, and how has OR fared in taking them up? We have inquired widely in academia and in industry over an extended period. We find that, after a slow start perhaps obscured somewhat by secret projects (we encountered more than a dozen), OR practitioners are now beginning to capture some of their abundant opportunities. Here are some examples, and we shall recount many more in their proper places. —Hewlett-Packard Company uses real option modeling for dynamic pricing and for managing supply/demand risk as a participant in High-Tech Exchange, a procurement-oriented electronic market for companies in computing and related industries [Billington 2000]. —MarketSwitch uses constrained optimization to make ad-and promotion-placement decisions for Internet advertising networks and e-commerce sites.

Specifically, we present a comparative case study on the introduction of two web-based platforms that facilitate coordination among healthcare providers and social insurance funds: e-prescription and e-reimbursement. Both platforms have been recently launched and their deployment has been accelerated in order to address the financial crisis. We analyse the complex interplay between policy, technology and everyday practices and we conceptualize the attempted healthcare reforms linked to the new platforms’ introduction as sociotechnical transitions. Applying the “Multi-Level Perspective” we map the overall dynamics. This mapping is complemented by employing the concept of “Institutional Work” that allows focus to the micro-level of transitions, the level of niche projects. We reflect on the usefulness of combining the “Multi-Level Perspective” and “Institutional Work” conceptualizations and we argue that this combination can offer a way to unpack experiences and gain insight that can be valuable for policy makers, technology providers and the academia.

The online presence of ideological groups has enabled the dissemination of group beliefs and ideas through a variety of new media outlets. Websites have offered a way for these groups to share aspects of their ideology and to create a sense of shared identity. While ideological groups have been of interest for decades, little empirical research has examined their online presence. The aims of this study were to compare nonviolent and violent ideological group websites with each other and with nonideological websites with respect to social categorization, moral disengagement, and website credibility, and to examine the relationships of psychological processes to website credibility. A content analysis approach was used to rate 105 websites (violent = 32, nonviolent = 36; nonideological = 37) for aspects of social categorization, outgrouping, moral disengagement, content features of credibility, and structural features of credibility.

516de22f51ee25eb93080b1d34bf3838e31cfd36	the study of interactive design in service systems for community self-help charitable facilities		With the birth of ergonomics, interactive design has covered many fields including psychology, physiology, sociology and economics. From a broader perspective, new concepts of interactive design study how to help consumers to use products or services in a more efficient, convenient and pleasant way. In the process of this study of the interactive design in service systems for community self-help charitable facilities, we used a number of different tools including depth interview, questionnaire survey, video logging and so forth to carry out researches on the social experience brought about by the industrial design of interactive products, the emotion cultivation, reconstruction effects of interactive interface, and the methods of arranging and integrating interactive information. We also explored how interactive design helped to raise the additional value and service quality in a systematic service. This article also analyzes deeply on the service design of community self-help charitable facilities, finds out current predicaments and how to get out of them from the perspective of design: making full use of interactive design and its unique properties, innovating in the process of service design, carrying out practical research and finally resulting in the rapid development of charities in communities. The outcome of this article aims to serve as a reference for governmental and social organizations to promote civilian charities in a way benefiting most people. Furthermore, with the in-depth research of interactive design, this article is also expected to propose directions for the studies on service design in the future.	interactive design;interactivity	Xiaorui Zhou;Zhejun Liu;Yangxi Tian	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-07308-8_39	public relations;human–computer interaction;marketing;business	HCI	-87.09826988043864	-8.184747095031033	30784

The leaders of Small Units (in context, defined as fire-team to Company equivalent groupings in the US Army and USMC) are required to make decisions, often in hazardous circumstances, in minimal time and with significant constraints on situational awareness. The nature of military operations is characterized as complex, dynamic and confused. These characteristics force the leaders to be intuitive and adaptable in their decision-making ability. Intuition requires experience, visualization and pattern recognition as requisite cognitive skills. Contemporary theorists label the leadership and decision-making required in the Contemporary Operating Environment (CoE) as 'adaptive'. The author contends that Serious Games, in particular Bohemia Interactive's VBS2, are powerful training enablers for Small Unit leaders operating in the CoE. The paper explores the reasons why Serious Games enable decision-making training and offers advice to non-technical leaders and trainers as to the conditions which Serious Games need to create to enable the use of Serious Games as an enabler for decision making training.	complexity;experience;full-spectrum light;operating environment;pattern recognition;scientific visualization;self-awareness		2010		10.1145/1878537.1878577		HCI	-74.3078206619312	-11.294592944060168	30791

Citizens are able to capture data and to reason about it. They are producers and consumers of their own data. Meanwhile, local administration is struggling with less resources and more pressure to become more efficient. In this paper we try to bridge the gap between these two different worlds, apart from each other, proposing a workflow. We discuss the advantages and the technical challenges we might face if crowded source data can be used by the administration. To make this possible, we take advantage of the existing European regulation, the INSPIRE directive, and designed a workflow to implement the rules regarding data specifications to the OpenStreetMap (OSM) data to combine it seamless with official existing datasets.	citizen science;data protection directive;directive (programming);infrastructure for spatial information in the european community;openstreetmap;seamless3d;source data	António José Silva;Jorge Gustavo Rocha	2014		10.1145/2691195.2691308	engineering;data science;data mining;world wide web	AI	-62.912266788595225	-3.359358876300646	30803

This started as a useful tool for researchers and was developed mainly due to the inspiration and efforts of Eugene Garfield, who in 1962 founded the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI). Many of us have undoubtedly used the Science Citation Index which, especially in the days before the web became the universal reservoir of knowledge, was the most efficient, if not the only, way of finding out what had been done in a given field of research. Even today, the ISI index remains a valuable tool. Unfortunately, it has become a tool not only for researchers, but also for administrators. While researchers use it to find out what others have been doing, administrators use it as a way of quantifying scientific quality. In most academic institutions, continued employment or promotion through the academic ranks requires an assessment of merit. This is not least the case in places where tenure is an essential step on the way. Academic merit is often assessed by means of peer reviews, but such assessments are both lengthy and costly. It would obviously be more convenient if a simple measure of quality was available. In many places this measure is the number of publications in recognised scientific journals. Ay, there’s the rub. The logic seems to run as follows: Recognised journals are those that are included in the Science Citation Index (perhaps because the ISI index makes the administrators’ life easier?). Young researchers are therefore recommended to publish only in those journals. This, however, creates a self-reinforcing tendency that works against journals not included in the ISI index, in the style of Joseph Heller’s Catch-22. If researchers are discouraged—or even outright forbidden—to publish in other journals, these journals have little chance of ever becoming recognised, at least in the above meaning of the term. The reason for making these comments is that the CTW finds itself in an uneasy position. On the one hand the journal has now been published for 5 years, and enjoys—we believe—a considerable respect in the field. On the other hand the journal is not in the ISI index, and the editors know of several cases where authors have not been allowed by their administration to submit papers. The CTW has obviously, through the publisher, applied to the ISI to be added to their list. Despite fulfilling the criteria listed on the ISI website, we have been told that it may take a year before a decision is made. In order to possibly speed up the process, the editors have been asked by the ISI to justify and explain why CTW is better than the journal that currently is ranked in the lowest position (in the relevant category of science). Needless to say, we have refused to do that, and consider even to be asked such a thing a disreputable request. The fact nevertheless remains that the ISI, which now is a business unit in the Thomson Corporation, has established a self-appointed monopoly, which many university administrators unfortunately willingly seem to tolerate. The editors will, of course, continue to work for the CTW to be included in the ISI index. This we do because the conditions force us to, and because it may be valuable for prospective authors, but not because we in any way recognise the legitimacy of the de facto monopoly. Hopefully the monopoly will not last for ever. The rapid development of information technology, widespread electronic publishing, and powerful search engines will probably soon make the ISI index an anachronism. This does not mean that the vision of Eugene Garfield is wrong or outdated, but only that it can now be realised in a more effective and more egalitarian way. And now for something entirely different. During the ninth conference on cognitive science approaches to E.

In recent years many meta-analysts have conducted moderator analyses in an attempt to develop and test theories. These studies suffer from several methodological problems and, as a result, may have contributed to rather than resolved inconsistent research findings. For example, a previous meta-analysis reports that task interdependence moderates the effect of top management support to render it a non-critical component in systems implementation projects when task interdependence is low. We show that this conclusion is the result of uncorrected measurement error and an erroneous application of a fixed effects regression analysis. We discuss other pitfalls in the detection and confirmation of moderators including the use of the Q statistic and significance tests. Our recommended approach is to break the sample into subgroups and compare their credibility and confidence intervals. This approach is illustrated in a re-analysis of the top management support literature. Our results indicate that top management support is important in both high and low task interdependence groups and in fact may be equally important in both groups. Guidelines are developed to help IS researchers properly conduct moderator analyses in future meta-analytic studies.		Mark I. Hwang;Frank L.

Although the advantages of internet are undeniable, however, from the pathological perspective its excessive usage is creating disturbances not only in family and relationships but also in health, academics and memory recall in users. Nowadays, the adults between the ages of 18-29 are considered as the most preoccupied population with internet. To explore the relationship among internet addiction with time management, and its impact on students' academic performance, this article presents the results of the study that was conducted with the students of Sukkur IBA. The article aims to analyze the relationship among internet addiction and time management. It also analyses the impact of time management on students' academic performance when considering internet addiction as a covariant. At the end, the article analyze the gender differences among level of internet addiction, time management and academic performance. Chi square independency test, t test and one way ANOVA tests were performed to analyses the data. The results seems to prove that internet addiction and time management are depend and variance in one can cause variance in other. The results also reveal that students' ability of time management has a significant impact on their academic performance. Lastly, the results provide evidences that students' gender has no impact on overall study."""	aaron iba;chi;coefficient;infiniband;interference (communication);internet access;internet addiction disorder	Shafaq Siddiqi;Zulfiqar Ali Memon	2016	2016 International Conference on Frontiers of Information Technology (FIT)	10.1109/FIT.2016.020	psychology;simulation;multimedia;social psychology	HCI	-86.75836078674833	-22.12617443973253	30822

A cultural emergence model of field-level logics was proposed in the latest development of the institutional logics perspective (Thornton et al. 2012). This study aims to validate a section of the model: the relationship between resource environment and emergence and evolution of field-level logics, and do so in the context of Apple’s independent Mac OS X developers – Mac indies. Through a qualitative interpretive study, and a combination of narrative and content analysis, we identify the resource environment of Mac indies: platform governance and developers’ own economy, and examine a critical platform governance change from Apple – its role shift from being primarily a technological platform to one that includes a market exchange, and show that a software ecosystem logic prevailed for Mac developers prior to the change, and a platform ecosystem logic emerged after that.	emergence;mac os x public beta;multi-level governance;software ecosystem;system 7	Yixin Qiu;Il-Horn Hann;Anand Gopal	2013			knowledge management;computer science;invisible hand;institutional logic;corporate governance	SE	-78.38872712811062	-11.70402252262091	30891

One major goal of these systems is to reassure university community members that administrators are aware of emergencies and are in control. These generic alerts, however, can cause panic because it increases concern for the safety of family and friends. Furthermore, people receive alerts that are irrelevant based on their current location. This poster describes an emergency alert system that provides personalized information to users. R U OK?, a SMS-based service, distributes emergency alert information along with status updates of those in one's close social network.

To explain the stability of existing relationships as well as the emergence of new ones, we paid attention to meeting opportunities in specific social contexts, such as the work place, family, sports clubs, voluntary associations, and the neighborhood.Notably, we found that a lack of meeting opportunities is an important reason why many personal relationships are discontinued, and that a path-dependent use of social contexts makes new relationships more likely to emerge in a specific context if existing network members are already met in that context. Finally, it is proposed that care should be taken when interpreting changes in personal networks if one relies on information about networks that are delineated using only one name generating question. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.	emergence	Gerald Mollenhorst;Beate Völker;Henk Flap	2014	Social Networks	10.1016/j.socnet.2013.12.003	psychology;social science;social organization;sociology;social psychology	DB	-88.29615901494523	-18.512758650322137	31063

Drawing from this ISO document and the management and information systems literatures, this paper discusses findings from interviews with 66 archaeologists and quantitative social scientists. We found similarities and differences across the disciplines and among the social scientists. Both disciplinary communities associated trust with a repository’s transparency. However, archaeologists mentioned guarantees of preservation and sustainability more frequently than the social scientists, who talked about institutional reputation. Repository processes were also linked to trust, with archaeologists more frequently citing metadata issues and social scientists discussing data selection and cleaning processes. Among the social scientists, novices mentioned the influence of colleagues on their trust in repositories almost twice as much as the experts. We discuss the implications our findings have for identifying trustworthy repositories and how they extend the models presented in the management and information systems literatures.

The methodology of soft systems is considered a potentially appropriate approach for investigating these perspeelives. The research findings illustrate various faelors that prove relevant in the incorporation and consideration of participant perspeelives in an interorganizational environment. Specifically, soft systems tools provide a consistent method of representing participant perspectives by enabling the designer to follow the same path for separate entities while respecting the individual nature of such perspectives. In addition, the use of these tools provides the designer with a method of building an incremental model, which incorporates participant perspectives, upon which to base the interorganizational system.	entity;soft systems methodology;ios	Patrick Finnegan;Colin O'Brien	1998	Int.

Given the large number of HIT papers published in IS journals, as well as the many special issues dedicated to HIT, and the role of IS special interest groups (e.g., AIS SIG Health) and specialized HIT conferences, it is time to take stock of the contributions of the IS community with regard to HIT. This paper provides a meta-review of HIT research - a review of nine prior IS HIT review papers from journals and conferences. Based on insights from our analysis, we create a new framework to classify IS HIT research (the PRECIOUS model). We argue that our framework leverages and extends the well-known PICO framework used in medical research to render it useful for IS scholars who seek to locate or classify the contributions of IS scholars to HIT research. In creating our PRECIOUS model, we also seek to remedy several problems that have previously been noted regarding the limitations of the conventional PICO model.	pico;whole earth 'lectronic link	Michael J.

Facing such challenges, some countries are supported by international assistance and donors. This research contributes to explain how such assistance on the development of national information and communication technology (ICT) strategies and programs is related to e-government development. This comparative study of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, (Former Yugoslav Republic of) Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia takes a Rational Neoinstitutionalist perspective to look at longitudinal changes in these developing countries. Quantitative data such as the amount of foreign aid for national ICT strategies and the e-government index are combined with qualitative information from reports and documents. The research suggests that the effect of international assistance on e-government is generally positive in less developed countries. The analysis of benchmarking and benchlearning as e-government policy-making tools is another aim of this study, providing a critical discussion of their role and that of the donor–benchmarker duality.	e-government	Endrit Kromidha	2012	Government Information Quarterly	10.1016/j.giq.2012.04.006	e-government;economics;computer science;operations management;economy;public administration;management;world wide web;economic growth;benchmarking	AI	-77.34768079533849	-5.426036826243028	31306

The networked structure of interactions on YouTube and the tremendous variation in the success of videos posted online lends itself to an inquiry of the role of social influence. Using a unique data set of video information and user information collected from YouTube, we find that social interactions are influential not only in determining which videos become successful but also on the magnitude of that impact. We also find evidence for a number of mechanisms by which social influence is transmitted, such as (i) a preference for conformity and homophily and (ii) the role of social networks in guiding opinion formation and directing product search and discovery. Econometrically, the problem in identifying social influence is that individuals’ choices depend in great part upon the choices of other individuals, referred to as the reflection problem. Another problem in identification is to distinguish between social contagion and user heterogeneity in the diffusion process. Our results are in sharp contrast to earlier models of diffusion, such as the Bass model, that do not distinguish between different social processes that are responsible for the process of diffusion. Our results are robust to potential self-selection according to user tastes, temporal heterogeneity and the reflection problem. Implications for researchers and managers are discussed.	aggregate data;aggregate function;autocorrelation;blog;conformity;digital recording;interaction;monetization;podcast;social computing;social media;social network;social search;structural holes;time-invariant system;user (computing);user-generated content	Anjana Susarla;Jeong-ha Oh;Yong Tan	2012	Information Systems Research	10.1287/isre.1100.0339	computer science;marketing;diffusion;multimedia;advertising;user-generated content;social psychology;world wide web;computer security;social network	Web+IR	-86.59155067188607	-14.12607539107923	31314

In this paper, we develop a dynamic adoption model that combines new product diffusion theory with online services privacy, and seek to offer marketing strategies to maximize vendors’ profit for online services. We divide the diffusion process into two steps: awareness and adoption, and assume awareness process is mainly influenced by word of mouth effect. The adoption process occurs when benefits adjusted personal information demand level (PIDL) from vendors is lower or close to privacy disclosure tolerance level (PDTL) of consumers. We get numerical solutions for this optimal control problem with two differential equations. Our findings suggest WOM effect, network externalities and the initial state of awareness proportion are effective marketing tools for vendors, and parameters or variables like marginal value for consumer information (MVI), population size and the initial state of adoption amount are less effective. Our study should be considered preliminary with limitations and extensions for future research.	e-services;internet privacy;marginal model;mobile app;numerical analysis;online service provider;optimal control;personalization;personally identifiable information	Wenli Li;Zhaoxin Geng	2015			economics;marketing;network effect;advertising;internet privacy	Web+IR	-89.76187913109183	-11.998829745924654	31331

Citation and publication counts are some typical examples. We propose a student-centric measure to assess researchers on their mentoring abilities. Our approach quantifies benefits bestowed by researchers upon their students by characterizing the publication dynamics of research advisor-student interactions in author collaboration networks. We show that our measures could help aspiring students identify research advisors with proven mentoring skills. Our measures also help in stratification of researchers with similar ranks based on typical indices like publication and citation counts while being independent of their direct influences.		V.

d4be13e26f498a948c367829246d1e4b9b37c137	the mediating path to a stronger citizenship: online and offline networks, weak ties, and civic engagement	interpersonal communication;empirical study;civic engagement;social network;community networks;social networks;computer mediated communication;strong ties;survey data;weak ties	Empirical studies of citizen communication networks and participation go as far back as the 1940s, with a bolder focus in political—not civic—activities. A consistent finding reveals that individuals with larger networks are more engaged than those with smaller networks. This article expands this line of work with a number of novel tests. First, it compares the predictive power of online versus offline network size on civic engagement. It then explores the role of strong-tie versus weak-tie discussion frequency and participatory behaviors. Finally, it examines the extent to which the contribution of network size, both online and offline, on civic engagement is mediated by discussion with weak ties. Using original survey data from a large national sample of U.S. adults, results indicate that (1) the relationships between online and offline network size and civic engagement are positive and fairly similar in strength, (2) weak-tie discussion is the strongest predictor of civic behaviors, (3) weak-tie discussion largely mediates the association between participation and network size online and offline, and (4) online networks entail greater exposure to weak ties than offline networks.

How can this evolutionary rhythm be described and made visible? Do different fields have different rhythms, and how can they be measured? In order to answer these questions a relative indicator, called R-sequence, was designed. This indicator is time dependent, derived from publication and citation data, but independent of the absolute number of publications, as well as the absolute number of citations, and can therefore be used in a comparison of different scientific fields, nations, institutes, or journals. Two calculation methods of the R-sequence—the triangle method and the parallelogram method—are introduced. As a case study JASIS(T)'s R-sequence has been obtained.

b4c087f0902a60282ed22b163c74a6fc55467c11	open access publishing policy and efficient editorial procedure	open access;n a	With the development of Internet, human societies have evolved rapidly with the emerging information society. The way of scientific communication has been changing dramatically. After a few years, the Online Journal publishing has been completely accepted by all scientific communities. The traditional business model of subscription based journal publishing is being challenged by the alternative Open Access publishing model [1-3]. However, financially sustainable Open Access publishing is still a goal difficult to reach. Dr. Shu-Kun Lin has been identified among the pioneers of Open Access in Natural Sciences, and has been managing online open access journals for about 10 years [4]. Dr. Derek McPhee and Dr. Francis Muguet have tried to help Dr. Shu-Kun Lin in order to make Open Access publishing a sustainable alternative which can be tentatively assessed, inter alia, by the quantity (number of published papers) and quality (impact factor of our journals). Entropy is an online Open Access journal and it is the Publisher's full intention to have it continue as such. As a general rule, traditional Open Access journals are working under the assumption that all authors are paying publication fees. However, as a remarkable exception, the journal Entropy had been operating without requesting publication charges. However, as the MDPI foundation needs a minimal financial balance to maintain its operations, it is not possible to continue without the kind help of authors who pay publication fees. Therefore, while we will continue to accept papers from authors that are not able to pay, their Open Access publication will be delayed [5]. Should the MDPI foundation receive major grants, the MDPI foundation will be glad to immediately resume totally free Open Access	early access;francis;internet;scientific communication	Shu-Kun Lin;Derek J.

A two-wave panel study with a 6-month time interval was conducted among a sample of 1412 adolescents aged 10e13. Cross-lagged panel analysis was used to investigate relationships over time between being a bystander of cyberbullying, empathic responsiveness towards distressed others, and the attitude towards cyberbullying, while taking into account involvement in cyberbullying as a victim or a perpetrator. The results indicate a negative relationship between standing by at Time 1 and empathic responsiveness at Time 2. In other words, exposure to cyberbullying as a bystander at Time 1 predicted subsequent lower levels of empathic responsiveness at Time 2. The attitude towards cyberbullying at Time 2 was not influenced by seeing more cyberbullying acts at Time 1. Further implications of the results for prevention and intervention, and for future research are discussed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The contents do no necessarily reflect the official views or policies of the State of California. This report does not constitute a standard, specification, or regulation. Executive Summary The Bay Area ATIS (Advanced Traveler Information System) testbed evaluation methodology is aimed at collecting, processing and enabling widespread dissemination of information on transportation conditions and travel options. A fundamental premise of the testbed methodology is that a public surveillance and database system, designed to open-architecture standards, will be the most effective in providing historical, real-time, and predictive information. When complete, the testbed infrastructure will include a comprehensive surveillance system, public databases designed to open-architecture standards, models for real-time prediction of future travel conditions, systems for communicating with travelers during pre-trip and enroute stages and importantly an ongoing evaluation methodology. The database will contain up-to-the-minute information on travel options, including automobile, bus and rail. This paper presents a conceptual framework describing various elements of the testbed evaluation and presents two field operational tests currently underway. Specifically, discussions on the TravInfo project and the Freeway Service Patrol evaluation project are presented. The framework developed in this paper is intended to influence the selection of other projects for which the testbed will provide a platform. have received valuable input from several individuals at the University of California.

3f69e5daedca7bd332bb338c0babf51f03303eff	the impact of introductory incentives on new users: evidence from an online health community		This paper studies the impact of short-term introductory incentives on new users in online communities. Many online communities now employ introductory incentives to attract new users and motivate user contributions, but the benefit of such incentives is still unclear. We draw on a policy change in a large online health community to compare new physicians who are affected by the policy versus those who are not. We find that even though introductory incentives increase contribution quantity during the policy window, such incentives can significantly decrease contribution quantity after the policy. The policy also harms the community by lowering contribution quality. On the bright side, introductory incentives can increase user retention and thus induce more contribution for the community over the lifecycle of users. Moreover, the effects of such incentives are contingent on users’ offline seniority, which creates opportunities for the platform to target different user groups with different incentives. These results are consistent with various robustness checks using different control groups. This research contributes to the literature on identifying the impact of introductory incentives and intertemporal change of monetary incentives in online communities. The findings also provide novel insights for incentive-driven online communities.

However, little is known about the underlying incentives that why content providers derive utilities from such activities. In this study, we build a dynamic structural model to recover the utility function for content providers. Our model distinguishes short-term payoffs based on ad revenue sharing from long-term payoffs driven by content providers' reputation. The model was estimated using a panel data of 914 top 1000 video providers on You Tube from Jun 7th, 2010, to Aug 7th, 2011 since top providers are more likely to be encouraged by these incentives. Our results show that video providers value incremental subscribers as much as incremental video views. We also find that top providers' reputation is influenced more by accumulative subscribers than by accumulative video views.	jun wang (scientist);panel data;revenue sharing;social media;the globe and mail;utility	Qian Candy Tang;Bin Gu;Andrew B.

There are several processes in order to make food available to consumers: for example, production, transportation, and consumption. Since the global demand of food is always on the rise, there is a need to improve the efficiency in all the processes in food industries. For example, the food production industries are often not equipped with the right decision-making tools to allow farmers to properly deal with important factors such as environmental changes. On the other hand, tools are not difficult to create but can be very challenging to be successfully adopted by the professionals, especially when the tools require them to change their normal work practices. In this SIG, we will discuss how HCI can improve food product industries with suitable information for each food process. \	decision support system;high availability;human–computer interaction;population	Winyu Chinthammit;Henry Been-Lirn Duh;Jun Rekimoto	2014		10.1145/2559206.2559213	agriculture;human–computer interaction;computer science;interaction design	HCI	-67.35218266021818	-1.9055481870443944	31726
50eee86ddfad1df50987b4d2ec8734394d61c199	the voice from the base(ment): stridency, referential structure, and partisan conformity in the political blogosphere		The Internet has become a critical medium for American politics: in 2008, almost half of American adults looked for political information online, and 30 percent of Internet uses contributed to online political discussions. Using the candidacy of Sarah Palin as a case study of a provocative political event, this paper examines the tone, partisan leanings, and referential structure of six elite blogs. First by randomly sampling overall trends of Palin coverage and then by performing a quantitative content analysis of a sub-sample of posts, this paper finds that the valence and stridency of blog posts vary by partisan identification, and that stridency dramatically affects the referential structure of posts. Although the referential structure of blog posts varies significantly by blog, it does not vary along partisan lines. Nonetheless, the relationship between stridency and partisan conformity exposed by this paper illustrates a trend amongst conservative blogs to repeat the allegations of “liberal media bias” often voiced by traditional conservative media outlets, contributing to an “echo chamber” effect in the blogosphere.	blogosphere;conformity	Elizabeth Anne Roodhouse	2009	First Monday		public relations;sociology;advertising;social psychology;law;world wide web	NLP	-82.43221716766969	-16.528543267084448	31761
e55ef1781ac348fcfbbaece7df20d9ab27647aef	an analysis of digital transformation in the history and future of modern ports		Digital transformation is of utmost importance in the business world with major impacts on any of its sectors. Here we consider ports and logistics within maritime shipping to exemplify those developments. That is, as actors in world-wide supply chains, seaports are particularly affected by technological change. Due to the high requirements in the logistics sector, e.g., regarding costs, efficiency, security, and sustainability, digital innovation is essential to stay competitive. Past developments show how digital innovation can shape the modernization of ports. In order to understand future challenges in this area, it is inevitable to review the outcomes of past developments and their impact on port operations. In this paper, we provide an extensive analysis of digital transformations in seaports. We identify three generations and analyze the stages of respective digital transformations using a well-known model from literature. Based on the observations, we identify important aspects and challenges.	exemplification;logistics;requirement	Leonard Heilig;Silvia Schwarze;Stefan Voß	2017			logistics;digital transformation;port;computer science;marketing;operations management;operations research	Security	-76.78280164889682	1.6980274703860214	31828

EMPATIA was targeted to deliver socio-economic and political benefits, such as enhancing citizen-government engagement, increasing public value through PB process, promoting ‘inclusiveness’ among the marginalized groups of citizens, and impeding political discontent that underpins distrust and scepticism towards the government. The attainment of these benefits will be driven by the EMPATIA’s performance. Hence, a performance measurement tools is needed to enable assessment of EMPATIA, empirically. With an aim to propose an integrated performance evaluation metrics, this study presents a set of assessment criteria for multi-channel digitally enabled PB service platforms – especially EMPATIA. Findings from a qualitative, multi-strategies research approach suggest that the metrics should include five key technical and non-technical performance indicators, to be used as the basis for the development of future evaluation instruments. Of major signposts, the metrics would inform key performance aspects to be considered during the PB platform development, and evaluated to indicate the PB platform performance.

The international Basel II Capital Accord therefore has imposed a strict timing on the banks’ compliance with sound risk management practice. In this paper, we present results from a field study at a large bank on the use of Group Support Systems (GSS) as a novel approach for senior managers to identify operational risks in the bank’s Incident Management Process. Our research leads to two important findings. First, we find that the use of GSS enables unique risks to reach a short-list of crucial risks to be managed by the bank. Second, the use of GSS allows an isolated minority of senior managers to implicitly influence the decision of the group on the risk management decision process.	emergence;field research;incident management;risk management;software testing	Anne-Françoise Rutkowski;Bartel Van de Walle;Gerd Van Den Eede	2006	Proceedings of the 39th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS'06)	10.1109/HICSS.2006.459	actuarial science;stability;risk management;computer science;knowledge management;environmental resource management;information management;management;information technology;collaborative software;operational risk;emergency management	Visualization	-83.03032774580969	-0.13440832870963612	32081

Enthusiasm for the potential of consumer participation in health and health care has found advocates among health systems and insurers keen to reduce costs and patient organizations agitating for improved recognition and care. Alongside these trends, we find an increased focus on consumer health in the disciplines of information science and informatics. Health information science studies examine information behavior, information policy, terminology and information retrieval systems. Health informaticians focus on the design and evaluation of consumer-facing technologies such as personal health records and health behavior tracking systems. Scholars in both fields pursue research concerning social media, including online patient communities. However, despite the growing momentum of scholarly activity in both fields, as well as their topical overlap, the fields remain largely separate, with differing research traditions and scholarly communities. In this panel, we find synergy and common ground between the two fields through an exploration of the conference themes of information, interaction and innovation. In a lightning talk format, eight panelists representing diverse research areas will share their perspectives upon key insights that each field can bring to the other. Building on the arguments presented, panelists and the audience will reflect on the state of consumer health research, and brainstorm regarding future scholarly directions that will leverage the strengths of both fields.	brainstorm;failure;informatics;information behavior;information retrieval;information science;social media;synergy;tracking system	Tiffany C.

Thus, a multilevel model of online collaboration technology adoption is proposed and tested, using hierarchical linear modeling techniques applied to a sample of 96 individuals who were nested in 34 virtual teams. Our findings suggest that a team member’s perceptions regarding the usefulness of an online collaboration tool positively affect his or her behavioral intentions to use this tool in a similar context in the future. Furthermore, after controlling for individual level perceived usefulness, group potency, as a team-level concept, incrementally and positively affected team members’ intentions to use the online collaboration technology with a similar team in the future.

The customization of an Enterprise System can be viewed as a specialization of an IT related business asset. Its customization should be driven by these strategic business goals. However, the implementation realities frequently tell a different story. Customizations are often not linked to strategic business goals and at times even run counter to these goals. Experiences have shown that these gaps can be costly and have severe business implications. Thus, it is important to understand how these discrepancies can occur, and subsequently, how to develop approaches to avoid unnecessary customizations. This qualitative study explores key influences on customizations in five major Enterprise System implementations. The analysis of the qualitative data collected in this study reveals key influence factors with their direct, as well as their indirect impacts on customization. The article further discusses how some of these influences can be leveraged by IT managers to guide customizations in a desirable direction.		Marc N.

Interviews were used as data collection method where: crisis managers discussed how the interface supports the design principles, crisis managers demonstrated common tasks in the system, and information from past crisis management activities was used as an indication of how the system is used in actual crisis management. The evaluation indicates that the design principles: 1) can be used to identify interface flaws, 2) can be a foundation for discussing temporality in design, and 3) can be used to explore temporality in general, including temporality found in: work tasks, the crisis context, and the interaction between crisis manager and information system. In addition, the evaluation suggests two new design principles as a complement to the original six principles. DOI: 10.4018/jiscrm.2012010103 30 International Journal of Information Systems for Crisis Response and Management, 4(1), 29-46, January-March 2012 Copyright © 2012, IGI Global.

A problem is how to consider these diverse aspects of time when creating an interface for a crisis management information system. Six specific design principles for how to consider time related aspects in the design of interfaces supporting crisis management have been suggested by Gryszkiewicz and Chen (in press), and this study aims at assessing and improving the design principles. Two sets of design principles which can be used in the development of crisis management systems are: the design principles for Situation Awareness (Endsley et al., 2003) and the general design principles for emergency response systems (Turoff, Chumer, Van de Walle, & Yao, 2004). Gryszkiewicz and Chen (in press) suggest six new empirically based design principles focusing on how temporality can be addressed in the design of information technology for crisis management, intended to complement the principles defined by Turoff et al. and Endsley et al. Temporality is here used to denote any time-related information connected to events and activities during a crisis. The reason for the new design principles is that two first sets only address temporality briefly. Endsley et al’s design principles focus on Situation Awareness (SA). The principles discuss how information systems should be designed in order to support the operator in understanding a situation, and through this aiding decision making. Turoff et al’s design principles are founded on experience and best-practice. They are, unlike Endsley et al’s, specifically directed at crisis management or emergency response systems. Temporality is mentioned in passing, for example, when discussing the importance of up-to-date information. This work has evaluated the design principles formulated and suggested by Gryszkiewicz and Chen (in press) to see if they can be used as a basis for interface improvement suggestions and to further refine the principles. The principles have been evaluated against two different crisis management information systems commonly used in Sweden. This was done through interviews with end-users of the systems; consisting of crisis managers in municipalities and rescue service personnel at different levels. The interviews also entailed the opportunity to study information from real crises stored in such systems. The reflections about the design principles presented in this paper are therefore based on the actual use of crisis management information systems. The contribution of this paper is a discussion of how the design principles for temporality can be refined, a discussion of how the design principles can be used in an interview setting, and the definition and suggestion of two new principles complementing the original six principles.	amiga reflections;emergency response systems;entity–relationship model;information systems journal;interviews;management information system;software design;word lists by frequency;yao graph	Anna Gryszkiewicz	2012	IJISCRAM	10.4018/jiscrm.2012010103	temporality;computer science;knowledge management;computer-supported cooperative work;management science;management;information system	HCI	-79.19779736360921	-2.826547693632277	32194

Design/methodology/approach – AI technologies and various technologies for facilitating the use of the currently existing libraries and the third-party resources are combined in the new mobile and social networking environments to provide an innovative real-time virtual reference service. Special aesthetic design and library marketing measures are adopted to expand the gains of the service. Questionnaire survey, in-depth interview, and statistical analysis are conducted to evaluate the effects of the service. Findings – A smart talking robot called Xiaotu (female) is developed. This robot is regarded as a promising new online reference service modus operandi. Four factors contribute to the success of the robot, namely, AI, self-learning, vivid logo and language, and modular architecture. Practical implications – Xiaotu presents a participatory library service, in which users participate in the resources collection and become content co-creators. Her presence at anytime and anywhere on any kind of terminal maximizes her potential for the delivery of virtual reference services. Xiaotu has the potential to be a general reference robot or a costumed institute robot. Originality/value – AI is adopted in libraries to form an innovative online reference service. The participatory library service is practiced through a high-featured interactive communication. The aesthetic design of Xiaotu and the related promotions are new in libraries as well.	anytime algorithm;artificial intelligence;librarian;library (computing);logo;natural language processing;real-time computing;real-time transcription;robot;social media;user-centered design;yao graph	Fei Yao;Chengyu Zhang;Wu Chen	2015	Library Hi Tech	10.1108/LHT-02-2015-0010	applications of artificial intelligence;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;knowledge management;service design;database;multimedia;management;world wide web;social network;promotion	AI	-83.33081940811093	-13.8164616546182	32197
8025a0ebfa4efffd946e93b2efd8532d29d20aef	summary of the bpi challenge 2013		For the third time, the Business Process Intelligence workshop hosted the Business Process Intelligence Challenge. The goal of this challenge is twofold. On the one hand, the challenge allows researchers and practitioners in the field to show their analytical capabilities to a broader audience. On the other hand, the challenge (and it’s data) allows for researchers to prove that their techniques work on real-life data sets. Every year, the challenge organizer’s look for a real-life event log which contains event-data of one or more operational business processes of an organization. This data is provided to the participants as-is, without any pre-processing or filtering (other than anonymization). The logs are made publically available and are given a DOI for future reference. In contrast to authors of scientific papers, challenge participants are not asked to write scientific descriptions of algorithms, techniques or tools, nor are they asked to provide scientifically well set-up case studies. Instead, the participants are asked to analyze the provided log data using whatever techniques available, focusing on one or more of the process owner’s questions or proving other unique insights into the process captured in the event log. A jury consisting of academic and industry members with a strong background in business process analysis assesses the submitted reports on completeness of the analysis, presentation of the results and on originality. Finally, the jury decides on a winner who receives a prize offered by one of the challenge’s sponsors:	algorithm;business process interoperability;content-control software;data anonymization;electronic organizer;preprocessor;real life;scientific literature	Boudewijn F. van Dongen;Brandon Weber;Diogo R.

Through data collection and analysis of three ICT enterprises in Guangzhou, 21 risk factors of ICT commercialization are identified with grounded theory and the three-level ICT commercialization risk factor model is established in the views of technical management, project management and dynamic capability. On the basis of the identified risk factors, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used to evaluate the risk factors, and 10 key risk factors (TOP10) are selected. Finally, the structural relationship of TOP10 risk factors is analyzed with Interpretive Structural Modeling, and consequently an interpretive structural model of the key risk factors is constructed, and root risk factors are found. The research is aim to improve the success rate of ICT commercialization.

120e7ad2660cdc8442394e33b347b195d786df5e	a commentary on developing work and quality improvement strategies iv		It is clear from the literature that there are significant relationships between the disciplines of quality and ergonomics/human factors engineering (Drury, 1997; Eklund, 1995). In many respects the application of one should provide benefits in the domain of the other. For example, improvements in the ergonomics aspects of hand tools can contribute to the quality of manufactured items through improved performance with respect to specifications and increased reliability in use. Similarly, quality efforts can be focussed on the process or the worker as an internal customer, often leading to improvements in the working environment. The current special issue has extended the scope of the above relationship between quality and human factors issues, beyond the design to product process and into the areas of community involvement (business or work related communities), human resource management and ‘spirituality’. The concept of community used by Carayon and Haims (in this issue) is an extension of the popular understanding of this term. They consider the community to be any entity or group of entities outside the organisation, presumably with a common interest or purpose. In order to illustrate the relationship between the quality of output of an organisation or group of organisations (one community) and the ‘community’, they point out that quality in the public school system community can be enhanced by the contributions of universities. For them, quality in the community means, ‘the health, safety and performance of the community’. In this author’s view this is all very reasonable and plausible. After all, the majority of our work efforts make a positive contribution to some community somewhere, unless our particular organisation is intent on defying the accepted minimum standards of health and safety and environmental legislation, or has some criminal intent. Nevertheless, within industry, the focus has tended to be on suitability of use with respect to functional performance, with AI & Soc (2003) 17: 192–195 DOI 10.1007/s00146-003-0258-x	entity;human factors and ergonomics;list of code lyoko episodes;software quality assurance	Enda Fallon	2003	AI & SOCIETY	10.1007/s00146-003-0258-x	management science;operations research	AI	-73.78174413222251	-15.632675613634644	32270

In our study, members of an academic community that does not have an online extension answered an open-ended questionnaire. The answers revealed some of their expectations about group applications. With these expectations in mind, we carried out a semiotic inspection of three popular applications. Within the specific range of topics covered in the study, our findings show three important factors that seem to determine the distance between what they expect and what they get: (a) technological resources are limited, but this can be substantially improved with broad band technologies; (b) some design decisions are questionable, and should be revised; and (c) online groups must all be structured and governed by some strict rules, regardless of how informal and loose they might be offline. Factor (c), in particular, seems to be tied to deeper scientific issues involved in the inherent social-technical gap of computer technologies for groups.	dreams;emoticon;nonlinear gameplay;online and offline;online community;semiotics	Elton José da Silva;Clarisse Sieckenius de Souza;Raquel Oliveira Prates;Ana Maria Nicolaci-da-Costa	2003			online participation	HCI	-74.70687062563812	-15.445472327280486	32287

The paper focuses on the follow-up and examination of the framework of technological relationships between human and non-human agents. The study allowed us to advance in the comprehension of the new technological repertoires (mobile telephone, chat, Internet) not as isolated instruments which are added to the social life of the subjects, but as technological mediations for the construction of social links, that is, as  linking machines.  The people do not relate with discrete and individualized technologies but with authentic technological settings in which both convergent and divergent relationships are generated.    We denominate this conjunction of technologies as  the ecology of technologies.  It proposes eight technological techno-mediation linking systems which are useful for analyzing the variations of the techno-linking settings of the urban young people, that is, the variation of ways in which young people operate different technologies to build and strengthen their social links..

64c21ac869a22c6e7d45396522cc46adc85be365	organizational attention		"""INTRODUCTION Attention is a term commonly used in education, psychiatry, and psychology. Attention can be defined as an internal cognitive process by which one actively selects environmental information (i.e., sensation) or actively processes information from internal sources (i.e., stored memories and thoughts; Sternberg, 1996). In more general terms, attention can be defined as an ability to focus and maintain interest in a given task or idea, including managing distractions. Attention is selective by its nature. According to Pashler (1998, p. 37), """" The process of selecting from among the many potentially available stimuli is the clearest manifestation of selective attention. """" Why do firms respond to certain events or stimuli in their environment while neglecting others? It seems that organizations, just like individuals , have limited attention capacity. Hence, they must select from among the many potentially available stimuli and respond to these selected stimuli only. Organizational attention is defined as the socially structured pattern of attention by decision makers within the organization (Ocasio, 1997). Organizational attention, like human attention , is a limited resource: """" Attentional limits filter or screen incoming information such that a great deal of data pertinent to strategic decision may never get processed """" (2003) show that the extent to which CEOs (chief executive officers) are selective in their attention to sectors of the environment is a significant predictor of performance. Knowledge management (KM) models and process theories, almost without exception, incorporate a stage or phase in which a given knowledge item is brought to bear on a current decision or action. This stage, referred to alternatively as, is of crucial importance in any knowledge-management cycle. The flow of knowledge in and out of an awareness stage is not merely a function of the universe of available organizational memory or the technological tools available to filter and identify such knowledge. It is influenced to a large degree by organizational attention. The second area in which organizational attention is key is knowledge acquisition and creation as discussed by Ocasio (1997), and Yaniv and Elizur (2003). Successful knowledge management requires attention. Davenport and Volpel (2001) argues that attention is the currency of the information age. Knowledge consumers must pay attention to knowledge and become actively involved in the knowledge-transfer processes. This is particularly important when the knowledge to be received is tacit (Nonaka, 1994). Knowledge can be part of the organization's repository, however, if it does not …"""	cognition;kerrison predictor;knowledge acquisition;knowledge management;relevance;software repository;theory;universal wavefunction	Eyal Yaniv;David G.

a238c167779cf145c3c40698c510d1142e6ba74f	the economics of digital media markets		This first issue of Information Economics and Policy for 2012 brings together a series of contributions related to the economics of digital media markets. The special issue covers eight papers, each highlighting areas where digital technology is altering markets in ways not fully captured by existing research. We see three key themes in the papers. The first is the continuing role of intellectual property rights and piracy in markets for creative goods. Piracy, especially file-sharing, has received much research attention in recent years, including in a 2010 special issue of IEP (Special Issue: Digital Piracy, 22(4) (2010)). Most work on this topic to date has centered on demand, especially the substitution of pirated work for original content and associated effect on firm revenues. In the current issue, the emphasis is on supply. Here we have two empirical contributions on the effect of digital technology on the market for music. Mortimer et al. (2012) considers how free redistribution of digital products affects the supply of live performance, finding that while file sharing reduces recording sales, it can increase demand for live performance. This is an important finding since these live performances tend to be highly profitable. Handke (2012) offers evidence that file-sharing has not reduced the supply of new titles in the market for recorded music in Germany. The paper also indicates that total listening time has not fallen in the file-sharing era. It may be that the growing importance of products complementary to recordings in the music industry documented by Mortimer et al. (2012) can explain some of this continuance in supply. Taken together, these two papers provide important new evidence that the overall effects of digitization on music markets may not in the long-run be as devastating as sometimes predicted.

The aim of the project is to provide laymen with information about their legal position in a liability case, based on retrieved case law. The process basically comes down to (1) analyzing the input of a layman in terms of a layman ontology, (2) mapping this ontology to a legal ontology, (3) retrieve relevant case law based, and finally (4) present the results in a comprehensible way to the layman. This paper describes the experiments undertaken regarding step 4, and in particular step 3.	artificial intelligence;best practice;experiment	Elisabeth M. Uijttenbroek;Arno R. Lodder;Michel C. A.

However, social media platforms such as Twitter have the potential to offer an additiona l route into raising awareness of general and specific health conditions. T he aim of this study was to investigate the extent to which a public health campaign , World Autism Awareness Day (WAAD), could increase Twitter activity and in fluence the average sentiment on Twitter, and to discover the types of inf ormation that was shared on the platform during a targeted awareness campaign. This study gathered over 2,315,283 tweets in a two-month period. Evidenc e suggests that the autism campaign, WAAD, was successful in raising awareness on Twitter, as an increase in both the volume of tweets and level of positive sen timent were observed during this time. In addition, a framework for assessing the success of health campaigns was developed. Further work is required on this top ic to determine whether health campaigns have any long lasting impact on T witter users.		Wasim Ahmed;Peter A.

8def91b5214ddbdd499ca5cf40ff20bb81a3113d	policy recommendations for open access to research data in europe - stakeholder values and ecosystems		RECODE will leverage existing networks, communities and projects to address challenges within the open access and data dissemination and preservation sector, and produce policy recommendations for open access to research data based on existing good practice. The open access to research data sector includes several different networks, initiatives, projects and communities that are fragmented by discipline, geography, stakeholder category (publishers, academics, repositories, etc.) as well as other boundaries. Many of these organisations are already addressing key barriers to open access to research data, such as stakeholder fragmentation, technical and infrastructural issues, ethical and legal issues, and state and institutional policy fragmentation. However, these organisations are often working in isolation or with limited contact with one another. RECODE will provide a space for European stakeholders interested in open access to research data to work together to provide common solutions for these issues. RECODE will culminate in a series of over-arching policy recommendations for a policy framework to support open access to European research data targeted at different stakeholders and policy-makers (http://www.recodeproject.eu).	constructor (object-oriented programming);ecosystem;limbo;telecommuting	Thordis Sveinsdottir;Bridgette Wessels;Rod Smallwood;Peter Linde;Vasso Kala;Victoria Tsoukala;Jeroen Sondervan	2014	Inf.

However, as studies are beginning to show, when those women are able to engage with Internet technology, a wide range of personal, family and community benefits become possible. The key to these benefits is on-line education, the access to which sets up a positive feedback loop. This review gives an overview of the digital divide, before focusing specifically on the challenges women in developing countries face in accessing the Internet. Current gender disparities in Internet use will be outlined and the barriers that potentially hinder women’s access and participation in the online world will be considered. We will then look at the potential opportunities for women’s participation in a global digital society along with a consideration of current initiatives that have been developed to mitigate gender inequity in developing countries. We will also consider a promising avenue for future research.	internet;online and offline;positive feedback	Amy Antonio;David Tuffley	2014	Future Internet	10.3390/fi6040673	digital divide;management;technology	HCI	-80.10180916144276	-10.080567605463767	32634
576d8686208b83daca62ce32dbbb970713b85e31	an exploration of the relationship between contribution behaviours and the decision making process in agile teams		Agile software development teams are self-managed; setting and complying their own rules, defining their own behaviours and encompassing a devolved decision-making structure. They rely heavily on the input of their team members for decision making. Research has indicated how ASD teams are susceptible to group process losses and coupled with traditional complexities, this produces some significant challenges. In the context of ASD teams, this research proposes that alternative-generation during decision making may only be achieved when group members engage in contribution behaviours. Drawing on existing literature, the paper examines the relationship between contribution behaviours and decision making. Utilising a multiple case study approach, it investigates the occurrence and impact of contribution behaviours during the group decision making process in ASD. Findings shed light on the important role that contribution behaviours play and reveal that many factors can influence their occurrence such as time pressure, skillset, experience and communication.	agile software development;breakout box;decision quality;fanout cable;futures studies;groupthink;information systems;information processing;matching (graph theory)	Sharon Coyle;Kieran Conboy;Thomas Acton	2015			r-cast;knowledge management;operations management	HCI	-80.61858532689006	2.6303716951065663	32649

ceb945a246d56568e8f8b93e0f0d87fb16157227	403 forbidden: a global view of cdn geoblocking		We report the first wide-scale measurement study of server-side geographic restriction, or geoblocking, a phenomenon in which server operators intentionally deny access to users from particular countries or regions. Many sites practice geoblocking due to legal requirements or other business reasons, but excessive blocking can needlessly deny valuable content and services to entire national populations.  To help researchers and policymakers understand this phenomenon, we develop a semi-automated system to detect instances where whole websites were rendered inaccessible due to geoblocking. By focusing on detecting geoblocking capabilities offered by large CDNs and cloud providers, we can reliably distinguish the practice from dynamic anti-abuse mechanisms and network-based censorship. We apply our techniques to test for geoblocking across the Alexa Top 10K sites from thousands of vantage points in 177 countries. We then expand our measurement to a sample of CDN customers in the Alexa Top 1M.  We find that geoblocking occurs across a broad set of countries and sites. We observe geoblocking in nearly all countries we study, with Iran, Syria, Sudan, Cuba, and Russia experiencing the highest rates. These countries experience particularly high rates of geoblocking for finance and banking sites, likely as a result of U.S. economic sanctions. We also verify our measurements with data provided by Cloudflare, and find our observations to be accurate.	blocking (computing);cobham's thesis;content delivery network;http 403;population;requirement;semiconductor industry;sensor;server (computing);server-side	Allison McDonald;Matthew Bernhard;Luke Valenta;Benjamin VanderSloot;Will Scott;Nick Sullivan;J.

This paper investigates user appropriation of emerging computing technologies, by focusing on Bitcoin, a digital monetary system supported by a peer-to-peer network of computing devices. We conducted in-depth interviews with sixteen Bitcoin community participants in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Baltimore. We describe user appropriation in this case of Bitcoin as a sociocultural journey-from encounter, research and learning, to socialization. We contribute the concept of cultural affinities, including conceptual, contextual and social dimensions, as important mediators leading to early-stage user appropriation.	bitcoin;booting;mike lesser;peer-to-peer;socialization	Yong Ming Kow;Sharon Xianghua Ding	2016		10.1145/2957276.2957279	public relations;engineering;advertising;commerce	HCI	-83.87777320887133	-14.955450902077928	32701

A sustainable  service in the proposed one-to-many SaaS-mode will therefore require an effective business model capable to lock-in customers.  For this purpose we propose applying general e-commerce business models. To tailor these for SaaS, we need to develop new  instruments in order to study the customer benefits and value creation. For our explorative empirical study we propose that  ease of use and usefulness from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) should be combined with content, context, and infrastructure  from Rayport and Sviokla’s model in order to study the evolution of the lock-in of the customers of online services. Our empirical  data on 251 online newspaper readers showed that the above-mentioned predictors appeared in new factorial combinations of  navigational characteristics, usefulness, novelty of the content, complementarities, and the context of the service. These  combinations were significant predictors of the customer lock-in, many of them being competitive. For the experienced customers,  personally relevant and useful content and effective infrastructure explained over 40 percent of the variance in the lock-in.  For the non-experienced users the novelty of the services was the most significant predictor of the lock-in. We discuss the  role of the customer value sources (novelty, effectiveness, and complementarities) for practical development of the online  Software as a Service offering.

While routine use is usually enough to obtain the first-order benefits of information systems once they have been deployed in an enterprise, more extensive and deeper use of these systems is needed to unlock their full potential. Encouraging individual employees to use information systems in this way often requires their IS colleagues to engage more fully with them to overcome uncertainties or a lack of training. This could take the form of IS professionals interacting with their non-IS colleagues formally or informally to provide relevant knowledge and guidance, and by taking the initiative to, for example, preempt challenges or develop useful tools. We draw on the concept of organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) to examine how the actions of IS employees can make it more likely for non-IS employees to engage in the deeper use of information systems. This study contributes to extending our understanding of the roles that IS employees play in improving the value that enterprises obtain from their IS investments, especially through their extra-role behaviors.	first-order predicate;information system;interaction;sim lock	Hadi Karimikia;Harminder Singh;Karin Olesen	2016	2016 49th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS)	10.1109/HICSS.2016.585	public relations;organization;knowledge management;marketing;management science;management;computational model;information system	SE	-82.91895899411986	-0.35849360258047647	32826

879424db2ffe1f73462fedd0d95e97a8b9c03451	measuring the efficiency of charitable giving with content analysis and crowdsourcing		In the U.S., individuals give more than 200 billion dollars to over 50 thousand charities each year, yet how people make these choices is not well understood. In this study, we use data from CharityNavigator.org and web browsing data from Bing toolbar to understand charitable giving choices. Our main goal is to use data on charities’ overhead expenses to better understand efficiency in the charity marketplace. A preliminary analysis indicates that the average donor is “wasting” more than 15% of their contribution by opting for poorly run organizations as opposed to higher rated charities in the same Charity Navigator categorical group. However, charities within these groups may not represent good substitutes for each other. We use text analysis to identify substitutes for charities based on their stated missions and validate these substitutes with crowd-sourced labels. Using these similarity scores, we simulate market outcomes using web browsing and revenue data. With more realistic similarity requirements, the estimated loss drops by 75%—much of what looked like inefficient giving can be explained by crowd-validated similarity requirements that are not fulfilled by most charities within the same category. A choice experiment helps us further investigate the extent to which a recommendation system could impact the market. The results indicate that money could be re-directed away from the long-tail of inefficient organizations. If widely adopted, the savings would be in the billions of dollars, highlighting the role the web could have in shaping this important market.	crowdsourcing;long tail;money;noise shaping;overhead (computing);recommender system;requirement;simulation;text mining	Ceren Budak;Justin M.

Using data from a field study conducted with 99 employees in a research organization, we found that one's referent choice varied with the domain of promise evaluated. When evaluating the organization's fulfillment of organization-wide promises, employees' referents were primarily coworkers with whom they had close direct ties, namely, friends and advice givers. On the other hand, when evaluating the fulfillment of job-related promises, employees' referents were mainly fellow workers who could substitute for them and people with whom they had multiple relationships.The effects of social influence also varied with the domain of promise evaluated. For organization-wide promises, employees' fulfillment evaluations were similar to those of their friends. However, for job-related promises, their fulfillment evaluations were dissimilar to those of coworkers who played the dual roles of friends and substitutes.This study advances psychological contracts research by demonstrating that third parties to the psychological contract can influence fulfillment evaluations. In turn, the effect of such influence is contingent on the domain of promises being evaluated and the nature of the networks. We discuss implications for research in psychological contracts, social networks and influence, and referent choice.		Violet T. Ho;Laurie L.

These self-references may result from the cumulative nature of individual research, the need for personal gratification, or the value of self-citation as a rhetorical and tactical tool in the struggle for visibility and scientific authority. In this article we examine the incentives that underlie self-citation by studying how authors’ references to their own works affect the citations they receive from others. We report the results of a macro study of more than half a million citations to articles by Norwegian scientists that appeared in the Science Citation Index. We show that the more one cites oneself the more one is cited by other scholars. Controlling for numerous sources of variation in cumulative citations from others, our models suggest that each additional self-citation increases the number of citations from others by about one after one year, and by about three after five years. Moreover, there is no significant penalty for the most frequent self-citers — the effect of self-citation remains positive even for very high rates of self-citation. These results carry important policy implications for the use of citations to evaluate performance and distribute resources in science and they represent new information on the role and impact of self-citations in scientific communication.	citation index;scientific communication	James H.

Most of the existing literatures have focused on the national level of cultural difference (e.g., individualism or collectivism) to explore individual behavior and group performance. There have been few studies identifying the role of individual level of cultural variability (e.g., self-construal) in multicultural group work. This study investigates the relationship between (a) self-construal and individual participation, and (b) self-construal and individual decision change in video-mediated multicultural group decision making. In a laboratory experiment, forty-five participants coming from fourteen countries formed ten multicultural groups. Each group solved a preference decision-making task using a group videoconferencing system. The results indicated a negative relationship between interdependent self-construal and individual participation in video-mediated group decision making. The relationship between self-construal and decision change was not found. Recommendations on increasing the participation of highly interdependent members are proposed.

Our focus is on the emotions expressed by editors in talk pages, measured by using the Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW).  We find evidence that to a large extent women tend to participate in discussions with a more positive tone, and that administrators are more positive than non-administrators. Surprisingly, female non-administrators tend to behave like administrators in many aspects.  We observe that replies are on average more positive than the comments they reply to, preventing many discussions from spiralling down into conflict. We also find evidence of emotional homophily: editors having similar emotional styles are more likely to interact with each other.  Our findings offer novel insights into the emotional dimension of interactions in peer-production communities, and contribute to debates on issues such as the flattening of editor growth and the gender gap.	interaction;mediawiki;wikipedia	David Laniado;Andreas Kaltenbrunner;Carlos Castillo;Mayo Fuster Morell	2012		10.1145/2462932.2462944	psychology;communication;social psychology	NLP	-84.28567337623022	-18.701013003595477	33022

One of the more confusing is that GSS groups have a higher leve of non-consensus than manual groups. Lack of consensu in GSS groups is considered to be a negative aspect o GSS. This paper argues that non-consensus is no necessarily harmful, and proposes an alternative interpretation of non-consensus using a measure other than actual consensus; an influence level of information. Experimental results show GDSS provide more influential information than manual groups and that measuring influential information can be a better predictor of satisfaction than actual consensus. We discuss these implications, as well as additional directions for further consensus research.	emoticon;generic security services application program interface;kerrison predictor	Wm.

Some performance assessment related indicators of data quality have improved since the system was launched in 2008. After a thematic analysis of the factors that may affect data quality, four domains were identified. They are data management, data collector, information system, and data collection environment. The findings are useful to guide data quality improvement effort.

This study adds to that stream by conceptualizing a model of the post-adoption process based upon the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) (Venkatesh et al., 2003) and refined based upon work in effort expectancy and social influence (Loraas and Diaz, 2009; Schepers and Wetzels, 2007). The general model is then stylized to the auditing context and an experiment is conducted to test the efficacy of the proposed model. Inline with expectations, effort expectancy influences how an intern auditor thinks about learning a new feature of a technology. Specifically, when the technology is deemed difficult to learn, attitude, anticipatory affect, time budget pressure and social influence are important. However, when technology is easy to learn only self-efficacy and negative anticipated affect are enacted.		Michelle Chandler Diaz;Tina M. Loraas	2010	Int. J. Accounting Inf.

These relationships could become closer and more frequent with the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs). In fact, portals could be seen not only as channels for providing government information and services, but also as powerful tools to exchange information and knowledge between different social actors and government entities and to enable participation in collective decision-making efforts about important public affairs. For instance, social media and other Web 2.0 tools could provide new electronic channels for these interactions through their inclusion in local government portals. This paper argues that although important modifications to the organizational and institutional frameworks would be necessary, the potential for local electronic governance through networks of government and non-government actors via internet portals is clearly present. However, a very important first step would be the inclusion of more interaction, participation, and collaboration mechanisms in government portals. Similar to previous efforts with data from the U.S., this paper describes the results of a recent assessment of local government portals in Mexico. The conclusion is that progress toward citizen engagement is slow in local governments and there are very few efforts to increase interaction, participation, and collaboration channels on their portals. Most of them are still following the vision of information and services providers and a local electronic governance model is still in its very initial stages. It seems that e-government in municipalities is still more rhetoric and less reality, at least in some countries.

abf0090d16ba47b4402a6693b0c9fa1febd5a3ff	digital government evolution: from transformation to contextualization		The Digital Government landscape is continuously changing to reflect how governments are trying to find innovative digital solutions to social, economic, political and other pressures, and how they transform themselves in the process. Understanding and predicting such changes is important for policymakers, government executives, researchers and all those who prepare, make, implement or evaluate Digital Government decisions. This article argues that the concept of Digital Government evolves towards more complexity and greater contextualization and specialization, similar to evolution-like processes that lead to changes in cultures and societies. To this end, the article presents a four-stage Digital Government Evolution Model comprising Digitization (Technology in Government), Transformation (Electronic Government), Engagement (Electronic Governance) and Contextualization (Policy-Driven Electronic Governance) stages; provides some evidence in support of this model drawing upon the study of the Digital Government literature published in Government Information Quarterly between 1992 and 2014; and presents a Digital Government Stage Analysis Framework to explain the evolution. As the article consolidates a representative body of the Digital Government literature, it could be also used for defining and integrating future research in the area.	capability maturity model;color gradient;digital electronics;e-government;multi-level governance;partial template specialization;reflections of signals on conducting lines;scientific literature;sensitivity and specificity	Tomasz Janowski	2015	Government Information Quarterly	10.1016/j.giq.2015.07.001	public relations;economics;knowledge management;public administration;management;law;world wide web	HCI	-73.5701562157569	-0.5229521226101721	33211

These factors include concerns for technology obsolescence, limited available capital, and lack of existing information technology (IT) infrastructure and experienced personnel. Application service providers (ASPs) have begun to emerge as an alternative approach to the more traditional acquisition of picture archiving and communication (PAC) systems. This approach offers the prospective PACS customer the opportunity to outsource hardware, software, and IT services to a vendor on a fee-per-use basis. The ideal candidates for such an approach would be small to medium-sized hospitals with limited existing IT infrastructure. Using the ASP model, prospective PACS customers can purchase services unique to their needs and upgrade or expand these as needed. As ASP vendors increase their customer base, there is the potential for customers to achieve unique economies of scale not available through traditional financing means. This report discusses the economic and operational issues associated with ASPs, as well as potential limitations and future implications of this phenomenon.	archive;aspirate substance;funding;information sciences;outsourcing;picture archiving and communication system;prospective search;radiology;united states indian health service	Bruce I.

Positive risk of creativity appears when there is an excess of creativity. This paper aims at exploring the concept of positive risk of creativity in software projects. It presents a taxonomy of positive risks as well as case studies of positive risks in diploma software projects. It also attempts to answer the question whether positive risks should be treated as expected results of applying creativity process, or they cause additional threats, or they can be treated as sources of opportunities. It appears that actually all options are possible depending on circumstances and each option requires a different approach to their management.	diploma;offset binary;taxonomy (general);threat (computer)	Anna E.

The sharability of a set of private knowledge is defined as the degree to which one feels willing to reveal that knowledge to people who are not members of one’s own organizational unit. This paper proposes a Value Frequency Model of Knowledge Sharing (VFMKS) to explain knowledge sharability attitudes and knowledge sharing behaviors. It reports qualitative findings from an exploratory field study of the degree to which constructs and relationships proposed by the model were consistent with the attitudes, opinions, and reported actions of professional Chief Knowledge Officers (CKO) from 16 organizations in France. CKO’s were consistent with most aspects of the model, suggesting quantitative investigation of the model may be useful. Critical incidents and utterances of the CKO’s did not address two constructs in the model during this study. Further investigation may show whether these effects manifest in other contexts, or whether they are extraneous to the model.		Imed Boughzala;Robert O.

This framework is integral in ensuring that personal data protection is impeded part of business processes of any systems that are involved in collecting, disseminating, and accessing an individual’s data. The cooperation and partnership between nations in passing privacy laws is essential and requires some building blocks. In this paper, the author argues that the building blocks should be integrated into the business processes and take into consideration three main domains: governments’ legislation, entity’s policies and procedures, and data protection controls. The proposed conceptual framework helps organizations develop data protection in their business processes, assess the privacy issues in their organization, protect the interests of their customers, increase their value proposition to customers, and make it easier to identify the impact of privacy on their business.	business process;information privacy;personally identifiable information;privacy law	Munir Majdalawieh	2010	IJISP	10.4018/jisp.2010070101	privacy software;privacy policy;information privacy;privacy by design;artifact-centric business process model;internet privacy;business process;computer security	DB	-75.17322706365887	-3.437069566112934	33476

Also, IT is quickly surpassing air transportation in terms of its carbon footprint. For these reasons, increased environmental awareness has increased interest in Green Information Technology (GIT) among IT practitioners. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to investigate behavior for the adoption of GIT applying the conceptual model, referred to as the ‘Theory of Reasoned Action’ (TRA). For this purpose, a survey was conducted among IT professionals from major public and private sector establishments. Findings indicated that behavioral intention influences actual behavior positively. IT professionals with positive intentions towards GIT issues are actually practicing GIT in their work. Results also indicated that external factors such as person related beliefs, sector of respondents’ establishment, and level of awareness have significant impact on attitude towards adoption of GIT. 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Using modern IT tools for communications with customers of banking services, banks create competitive advantages as well as opportunities for providing banking services in a way which would be convenient for consumers. After a short introduction the authors define the assumptions for the study. The methodological approach, based on theoretical and empirical study in the field of e-banking, allows them to build the evaluation model for the construction of high quality e-banking website each year. Subsequently, authors carried out multilateral analyses and presented the conclusions of the study. The identified categories are classified into three groups: economic, technological and anti-crisis. The originality of the work comes down to knowledge of the determinants of customer’s quality perception of websites and a starting point for effective quality management of their e-services banking system.	online banking	Witold Chmielarz;Marek Zborowski	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-30528-8_9	accounting;advertising	Logic	-86.9595684892892	-7.542330736968191	33634

The model, based on a game theoretical framework, is concerned with decision support applications. Presented in this paper is a case study analysis of a geographical region in which a provider of pathology services is concerned at the prospect of being exposed to competition from a new entrant. The incumbent provider may undertake strategic investments to create a stock of knowledge and goodwill with the intention of dissuading others from entering the market. The effect of a new entrant is modelled as perturbation of a pre-existing stable Nash-Cournot equilibrium in an oligopolistic market, and is influenced by market forces subject to Government regulation. The original contribution of this study is to identify the nature of these potential strategic investments and their interaction with cash flows. Recent historical data and managerial analysis are used to characterise market growth. An estimate of the incumbent provider's market share which is at risk can be found by examining the local geographical distribution of providers and purchasers of pathology services. On the basis of this analysis we propose a method for obtaining the strategic investment profile which minimises the total investment required to deter entry.		C. B. Lee;W. D. Murphy;Leslie R.

In practice, this essential cooperation is sometimes not attained or is reduced due to poor information sharing, non fluent communication flows, and lack of coordination. We report an empirical study of IT mediated cooperation among Spanish response agencies and we describe the challenges of adoption, information sharing, com munication flows, and coordination among agencies that do not share a unity of command. We analyze three strategies aimed at supporting acceptance and surmounting political, organizational and personal distrust or skepticism: participatory design, advanced collab orative tools inducing cognitive absorption, and end user communities of practice.	autonomous robot;denial-of-service attack;distrust;expect;management information system	Ignacio Aedo;Paloma Díaz;John M.

While it has long been known that customers differ in their state of shopping, it is cumbersome to learn about such latent differences offline. The availability of clickstream data however helps us in identifying meaningful segments of sessions on the basis of customers’ online behaviors. We examine whether product and price information had different impacts on customers belonging to three states of shopping, and also assess the effect on outcomes within a session and across sessions. Our results question the practice of offering price promotions to all customers of a store, and highlight the value of product information in increasing loyalty for some customers. Depending on the retailer’s goal– short term conversion versus longer-term customer relationship–a different information provision strategy is likely to be optimal.	behavior model;clickstream;customer relationship management;futures studies;information systems;joseph d. novak;norm (social);online and offline;online search;online shopping;purchasing;timing closure;user experience;user-generated content;word lists by frequency	Vandana Ramachandran;Siva Viswanathan;Hank Lucas	2010			clickstream;computer science;marketing;advertising;world wide web;commerce	Metrics	-86.23037835316515	-12.719271317337203	33726

The purpose of this paper is to increase the understanding of how practices and tools co-evolve, with a specific focus on the role of context, and based on this to offer relevant design implications. The empirical motivation comes from attempts to utilize information and communication technologies (ICT) in resource-constrained settings.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Design/methodology/approach#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Empirical work was conducted in primary healthcare facilities in Tanzania that offer Prevention of Mother-To-Child Transmission services. Four health facilities with different organizational and socio-economic characteristics were studied using ethnographic methods (participant observation, interviews and document analysis). The authors have employed activity theory as the theoretical framework, since it explicitly places human activity within a cultural, social and temporal (developmental) context. Specifically, the concept of mediation breakdown was used for data analysis at activity, action and operation levels.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Findings#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#By focussing analytically on situations of mediation breakdown in the situation of use, at both an activity, action and operation level, the authors have achieved an understanding of how information tools are being adapted to both their contextual conditions and the information needs of the community of users.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Research limitations/implications#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#The study illustrates the decisive role that context may play in shaping the actual usage of information technology.

Design/methodology/approach – The research is based on a reader survey, a citation analysis and an editor survey. The reader survey identifies both differences in journal rankings between practitioners and academics and the contribution of practitioners to LIS journals. The editor survey provides the proportions of practitioners and academics for the journals. The citation analysis shows the disparities in information exchange between the journals mainly preferred by practitioners and those more favoured by academics. Furthermore, it is possible to explore if practitioner journals differ from academic journals in the citation indicators and in other data collected in the editor survey. Findings – It is found that: practitioners play an active role both as readers and as authors of articles in LIS journals; there is only a low level of information exchange between practitioner and academic journals; the placement of advertisements, the size of the editorial board, requirements concerning an extensive bibliography, the number and the half-life of the references show a clear distinction between practitioner and academic journals. Interestingly, the impact factor did not turn out to be a good indicator to differentiate a practitioner from an academic journal. Research limitations/implications – This research is only exploratory because it is based on separate studies previously conducted. Further research is also needed to explore the relationship between practitioners and academics more deeply. Originality/value – The value of this paper lies in bringing together the findings from complementary studies (reader survey, editor survey and citation analysis) and identifying hypotheses for future research, especially with regards to the roles of and interactions between LIS practitioners and academics in scholarly communication.	citation analysis;information exchange;interaction;library and information science;requirement;scholarly communication	Christian Schlögl;Wolfgang G.

Drawing on the writings of Michel Foucualt and Pierre Bourdieu, as well as several Anglo-American cultural studies of disciplinarity, the essay argues that digital media studies has not yet constituted a truly novel scholarly discourse. Because of that, our reasons for disciplinizing—to the extent that it is possible to choose to become a discipline—would be largely strategic. Given that the field is already successfully reproducing itself, the symbolic benefits of becoming a discipline are relatively limited, and such a move would also have significant intellectual costs.	digital media;michel hénon	Jonathan Sterne	2005	Inf.

This accessibility is frequently abused (e.g., vandalism and spam). However, certain inappropriate behaviors are more threatening than others. In this work, we study contributions which are not simply """"undone"""" -- but deleted from revision histories and public view. Such treatment is generally reserved for edits which: (1) present a legal liability to the host (e.g., copyright issues, defamation), or (2) present privacy threats to individuals (i.e., contact information).  Herein, we analyze one year of Wikipedia's public deletion log and use brute-force strategies to learn about privately handled redactions. This permits insight about the prevalence of deletion, the reasons that induce it, and the extent of end-user exposure to dangerous content. While Wikipedia's approach is generally quite reactive, we find that copyright issues prove most problematic of those behaviors studied."""	accessibility;spamming;undo;wikipedia	Andrew G.

0038937ca9ae7c0b0a9d3e0249bb1ab638e9e630	on it control weaknesses in auditors’ reports on internal control		By analysing auditors’ SOX 404 reports from 2004 to 2009 we find after 2006 that reporting of information technology control weaknesses (ITWs) decreased significantly, primarily by Big 4 firms. This change appears to reflect Big 4 reporting practices in response to a change in auditing standards rather than the nature of Big 4 clients’ internal control systems, suggesting that SOX 404 auditors’ reports have become less informative. We find associations between ITW reporting and both non-ITW and financial misstatement reporting are moderated by auditor type and time period (2004-2006 vs. 20072009). Based on frequency of reporting, the relative ordering of individual ITWs, while differing over time, is similar over auditor type, company size and industry. We identify a small number of non-ITWs in SOX 404 reporting that may hold practical implications for an auditor’s consideration of IT control testing and an educator’s teaching of IT and non-IT controls.

An electronic village is considered as a virtual organization formed by representatives of different sectors who work together during a period of time to realize a common goal. We assume tight coupling between the virtual organization and a physical space to differentiate the electronic village of local interest from the notion of the global electronic village. In this context, the paper focuses on two primary issues, namely the stimulation and organization of collaborative work by virtual teams and the design of electronic artefacts which facilitate collaborative feedback and feedthrough in an exemplar case in the context of eΚοΝΕΣTourism – a pilot electronic village on regional tourism.	baseline (configuration management);virtual organization (grid computing)	Demosthenes Akoumianakis;Nikolas Vidakis;George Vellis;Giannis Milolidakis;Dimitrios Kotsalis	2007				DB	-81.60791874007332	-5.1570348087858475	33879

Other purposes include: to explore the status of adoption of subscription-based e-resources among the university libraries in Bangladesh; to assess the level of information and communications technology skills of library and information science (LIS) professionals working in the university libraries; and to illustrate the government initiatives on digitization/DL development. Design/methodology/approach – The current study used the mixed methods, i.e. qualitative and quantitative. A questionnaire was prepared to assess the existing status of DL systems in university libraries of Bangladesh and to meet other purposes of the study. The population of the study included the heads of the public and private university librarians in Bangladesh. Several phone contacts were made for this study. A good number of e-mail addresses of the librarians of public and private universities in Bangladesh were collected over the phone. The study was conducted from June 2012 to September 2012. Of the 50 identified respondents, the author received 30 completed questionnaires. The heads of 18 public universities and 11 private universities and one international university responded to this study. Two responses were received by post. Therefore, the response rate for the current study is 60 per cent. Findings – As part of the government’s pledge to build “Digital Bangladesh”, several initiatives have been taken that are related to digitization, information development and developing repositories and e-services for citizens. However, not much initiative has been taken to develop nationwide DLs in Bangladesh. In terms of e-resource usage scenario, public university libraries are better in offering e-resources to its students and faculty members than private university libraries in Bangladesh. Finally, it turned out that the majority of the university libraries in Bangladesh are not ready to be digital. Lack of funds, lack of infrastructural support and lack of skilled LIS professionals are the main reasons hindering the development of DLs in the university libraries of Bangladesh. Originality/value – This study will help DL researchers around the world in getting information on the status of DLs in Bangladesh. The Government of Bangladesh, policymakers, university authorities and LIS professionals in Bangladesh will highly benefited from this research. No study to find DL readiness of the universities has so far been conducted.	digital library;e-services;email;librarian;library (computing);library and information science;software repository	Nafiz Zaman Shuva	2014	OCLC Systems & Services	10.1108/OCLC-04-2013-0010		HCI	-82.05789182006109	-11.220223459286998	33958

However, virtual collaboration seems to work well for some cases, but not for others. This phenomenon motivates research questions: What factors determine the suitability of collaboration virtualization, and how do those factors affect the design of effective collaboration systems? Our literature study yielded little theoretical work in this regard. As such, we believe that research on collaboration virtualization theory (CVT) is critically needed. To this end, we present our preliminary findings on the purpose and composition of collaboration virtualization theory based on the literature. Essentially, our CVT contains three categories of constructs: task, team, and technology characteristics. Our main objective in this short paper is to initiate a new theoretical perspective for research in the field of collaboration technology and management.		Shaokun Fan;Choon-Ling Sia;J.

395863f060491b3ec5c8b39afc23a573ac00810a	mega and consumer trends - towards car-independent mobile applications	automotive;mobility	The car industry is confronted with fundamental changes in society, technology and economy and forced to rethink its concept of mobility. Through constant strategic foresight, trend management and a holistic mobility vision, car manufacturers must develop innovative strategies that reflect current and future trends, in order to meet customer needs, technological standards and economic imperatives. Therefore, car manufacturers are shifting their value chain more and more towards the aftermarket and information technology (IT). Used as a tool for image branding and innovation monitoring, a closer look reveals that car manufacturers are constantly increasing their investment activities in technology start-ups. This indicates that the car industry is in the middle of a transformation process, transforming from a car producer to a mobility provider. Based on an analysis of future driving factors in the car industry and in-depth interviews, we identified six crucial megatrends: peak oil and global warming, connectedness, safety regulations, sharing economy, urban mobility and aging society. Furthermore, four shaping consumer trends were revealed: ownerless, simplicity, eco-lifestyle and personalization. In summary, the most successful providers in the mobile market might be those who understand thoroughly the consumers’ needs and behaviour, in order to offer the mobility services they desire.	credential;emergence;holism;mind;noise shaping;personalization;sharing economy	Greta Seeger;Markus Bick	2013				HCI	-78.32571549693954	-9.693171016104907	33977

Offshoring has been viewed as a global phenomenon on the economic frontier. While new technologies need to be framed, stopgap arrangements in the form of transient solutions to upgrade the current systems are also desired. Newer regulations and multi-jurisdictional compliance have profound impacts on the growth of outsourcing projects. The development of new technological solutions must challenge the myth that legislation and statutory practices are the only possible mechanisms to counter the unscrupulous activities in the context of outsourcing. A change in the outlook toward such methodologies is essential to shed away the technological inertia and latency. This chapter opens up discussion issues in the perspective of hardware and software requirements for efficient offshoring. The aim is to achieve higher precision, protection, and throughput by applying core-computing techniques to the existing practices of outsourcing.

However, the international scientific research cooperation about health management study between countries needs to be further encouraged. 17 researchers can be seen as the academic leaders in this field. 37 research institutions play a vital role in the information dissemination and resources control in health management. The component analysis found that 22 research groups can be regarded as the backbone in this field. The 8 institution groups consisting of 33 institutions form the core of this field. USA, UK and Australia lie in the center by cohesive subgroup analysis; Based on keywords analysis, 44 keywords with high frequency such as care, disease, system and model were involved in the health management field.   CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that although it is growing steadily, collaboration behavior about health management study needs to be enhanced, especially between different institutions or countries/regions, which would promote the progress and internationalization of health management. Besides, researchers should pay attention to the cooperation of representative scholars and institutions, as well as the hot areas of research, because their experience would help us promote the research development of our nation."""	community;internet backbone;keyword;rem sleep behavior disorder;scientometrics;social network analysis;subgroup a nepoviruses;vertebral column;web of science	Chichen Zhang;Qi Yu;Qinghua Fan;Zhiguang Duan	2013		10.1186/1472-6947-13-52	health administration informatics;health policy;health informatics;public health informatics;medicine;knowledge management;hrhis;nursing;management science	HCI	-76.35012034316846	-23.79468005652144	34005

This study suggests that video game addiction can be statistically predicted on measures of hostility, and a group with high video game addiction has more hostility than others. Both gender and video game addiction are negatively associated with academic achievement. Family function, sensation seeking, gender, and boredom have statistically positive relationships with levels of social skills.

This fact, coupled with the sheer number of journals related to expert systems technology, raises several questions. How do students and researchers decide which journals to read, and where to submit their work for publication to get maximum exposure? How do librarians decide which journals should get their limited subscription dollars? When promotion time rolls around, how do administrators objectively judge the relative impact of their researchers? Objective answers to such questions will not only meet the specific needs of individuals, they will also help foster the development of the field itself by documenting and contributing to its formative research tradition. Here, we re-evaluate the journals from an earlier study (C.H. Cheng et al., 1994) by assessing their breadth, consistency, trend, and intensity of recognition: is the journal prominently cited in a broad range of expert systems journals (breadth)? Is it prominently cited over a series of consecutive years (consistency)? Is it at least as widely cited in the most recent years as it was in earlier years (trend)? Is it cited more than average (intensity)?.<<ETX>>	expert system;librarian;software documentation;systems theory	Chun Hung Cheng;Clyde W.

America's tenth Presidential Library is in its early period of formation. In Fall 2000 a former auto dealership's building, with 30,000 thousand square feet of space and plans for adding another 20,000 square feet, in Little Rock, Arkansas began as the home for the team of archivists organizing Clinton's presidential records. Projected to be the largest of the Presidential Libraries, the records and memorabilia will fill 67,000 cubic feet while the William J. Clinton Presidential Foundation raises funds to build a permanent home for the library. Quietly, with little fanfare, begins yet one more Presidential Library in a system that has been lauded, lambasted, and lamented since its start more than sixty years ago with the founding of the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Library in New York. While the stones of this new pyramid are dragged into place, the federal government continues in its struggles to resolve the ownership of the records of one of its deceased pharaohs. On June 12, 2000 the U.S. Justice Department approved the payment of $18 million to the estate of former President Richard M. Nixon in """"compensation"""" for records seized when he resigned in 1974. The bulk of the funds, nearly half, would be going to the Nixon Presidential Library in Yorba Linda, California. Peter Kornbluh, senior analyst at the National Security Archives, remarked, """"It is unfortunate that taxpayers have to pay for what is already rightfully theirs.""""' It is also unfortunate that yet another presidential library has gained funding that will keep it in the business of commemorating the legacy of this particular president, both competent and disgraced, in a manner that sees no end and that is contributing to a system spinning out of control.

27dc34061d0fcc2035a463c4d51303d8c1d2f366	course description: social issues and impacts of computing	social issues	"""Computer technologies are rapidly beginning to penetrate our everyday lives. As they become pervasive , they can alter the texture of our society with an intensity similar to that of the radio, automobile, jet plane, electricity, telephone, and television. In their early years, new technologies offer tremendous promises to increase the quality of life for their consumers. Computing was first introduced in scientific laboratories to execute complex calculations and in large organizations to help keep track of large files of records. Generally, """"organizations"""" (and their members) were the early consumers of computing and the public was effected in a secondary fashion. However , as a larger number of record systems (e .g ., billing, school registration, Social Security) became automated, the public became more directly implicated in computing-its benefits and its problems. Computing is continuing to spread as banks build electronic funds transfer systems, as businesses continue to automate a variety of activities including text preparation, and perhaps with widespread electronic mail. In addition, as microprocessors become cheap, they may become widespread so that many homes will have small computers . While at times the """"benefits"""" of computing appear intangible, there are often at least some clear gains and little apparent harm. It is easy to think that all of this computer use is simply and unequivocally a good thing ; and the more, the better. However, when high technologies are adopted on a large scale, they often lead to social problems as small problems magnify in size. For example, , cars were an optional novelty and recreational vehicle in the horse and buggy Los Angeles of 1900. Automobiles spread, in part, because they offered rapid travel to distant places. One could easily live in Pasadena and dine in Newport Beach. Today they dominate the social architecture through freeways which link sprawling suburban tracts, regional shopping centers, and widely scattered workplaces. As congestion has increased, smog and sprawl have become the most visible byproducts of cars in Southern California. The example of automobiles in Southern California may be widely applicable to other technologies including computing. Most complaints about modern """"industrial technology"""" focus on large scale, relatively inflexible technologies with centrally managed in frastructures. Thus, the automobile, television, jet planes, and nuclear power raise troublesome problems. On the other hand, individually con-trollable technologies such as the telephone, cameras, typewriters, and photocopiers have been applauded or silently accepted.

However, the research record includes tongue-in-cheek papers written in the conventional form and style of a research paper. Although these papers were intended to be taken ironically, bibliographic database searches show that many have been subsequently cited as valid research, some in prestigious journals. We attempt to understand why so many readers cited such ironic science seriously. We draw from the literature on error propagation in research publication for ways categorize citations. We adopt the concept of irony from the fields of literary and rhetorical criticism to detect, characterize, and analyze the interpretations in the more than 60 published research papers that cite an instance of ironic science. We find a variety of interpretations: some citing authors interpret the research as valid and accept it, some contradict or reject it, and some acknowledge its ironic nature. We conclude that publishing ironic science in a research journal can lead to the same troubles posed by retracted research, and we recommend relevant changes to publication guidelines.

db4b39bdb42534e3468ebe6bdd99f9d7b7add7ac	designing a peer feedback mobile application as a professional development tool		This paper describes a mobile application that functions as a professional development tool by leveraging peer feedback in corporate environments. Specifically, the focus has been on feedback about specific events where a behaviour around transversal competencies was evident. The design of the application and the analytics made the attempt to emphasise the professional development dimension of peer feedback, as opposed to merely a quantitative performance management one, and the appropriate aggregation of any analytics so as to avoid any inappropriate employee “surveillance” effects. Moreover, the paper presents results of three trials with employees and line managers in corporate environments. The trials confirmed the hypothesis that our method and application would function positively in combination with or as an improvement upon traditional performance management methods and tools, such as annual performance reviews or 360(^{circ }) feedback, assuming there is feedback culture and institutional support in the organisation.	mobile app	Evangelos Kapros;Mirjam Neelen;Eddie Walsh	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-58515-4_31	simulation;engineering;knowledge management;multimedia	HCI	-84.11230896920083	-1.868810478367282	34309

The objective of this study is to investigate the individual and network level mechanisms that characterize interactions on these electronic knowledge networks (EKNs). Toward that goal, we develop a simulation model of a thread-based asynchronous EKN and provide results based on 330 runs of the model (simulating a total of 3,643,942 messages generated by 38,860 authors). This study contributes to our understanding of electronic knowledge networks by demonstrating the importance of structural characteristics in influencing participant behaviors. We focus specifically on the role of preferential attachment (the tendency to associate with the most popular participants) and mutuality (the tendency to maintain symmetry in relationships with others) in network formation. By using a simulation method and taking into account the nature of interpersonal ties, the study extends previous mathematical models of network formation to the specific setting of online knowledge exchange between individuals.	agent-based model;agent-based social simulation;attachments;closing (morphology);conversation threading;design of experiments;external validity;focus group;interaction;internet;mathematical model;network formation;network theory;observable;relevance;simulation	Steven L.

Some sciences such as ecology and environmental science are inherently integrative, requiring the combination of many types of information from many sources in order to answer more complex questions than has been previously possible. This new information and the information management tools designed to deal with this volume of data will help us make informed decisions that will impact human health and prosperity. To enable this cross-scale, interdisciplinary integration for the coming generations of scholars, data must be managed to facilitate interoperability, preservation, and sharing.

Beyond what cognitive models offer, our results show that both cognitive and emotional responses play a key role in communication through websites and that the hedonic-utilitarian dual mediation hypothesis is the best fitting model in comparison with the four alternatives tested. Moreover, attitude is treated as a bi-dimensional construct made up of a hedonic and a utilitarian component. Based on this, an additional contribution concerns the correspondence that exists between consumer cognition and the utilitarian dimension of attitude, as well as the emotions expressed by subjects and the hedonic dimension of attitude. The relative importance of each dimension of attitudes can provide marketers in e-commerce settings with insights about whether to introduce more emotional appeals or more cognitive stimuli when communicating through their websites.

In response, certain governments have published strategies pertaining to information security on a national level. These policies aim to ensure that critical infrastructure is protected, and that there is a move towards a greater state of information security readiness. This is also the case for South Africa where a variety of policy initiatives have started to gain momentum. While establishing strategy and policy is essential, ensuring its implementation is often difficult and dependent on the availability of resources. This is even more so in the case of information security since virtually all standardized security improvement processes start off with specifying that a proper inventory is required of all hardware, software, people and processes. While this may be possible to achieve at an organizational level, it is far more challenging on a national level. In this paper, the authors examine the possibility of making use of available data sources to achieve inventory of infrastructure on a national level and to visualize the state of a country's information security in at least a partial manner.	critical infrastructure protection;information security;internet	Ignus P.

In the beginning, the brief description of the signage system evolution is described; next, the carried out experiment is depicted. The preferences of the 32 subjects were obtained using pairwise comparisons of the designed screen formats. Then the priorities were derived by applying the Analytic Hierarchy Process framework. The gathered data were modeled and analyzed by means of the analysis of variance, multiple regression, and conjoint and factor analyses. The results suggest that the application of different methods of preference analysis may provide additional information that could facilitate more in-depth understanding of the given preference structure.

We also propose methods to calculate indicators derived from these citation generations.

While most of the participants in that early conference, despite their often-expressed interest in the concept of nonlinear visualization of texts, were clearly oriented toward the goal of producing a printed book, two generations after that founding conference, we can recognize that the value of their work lies in their having begun to establish humanities computing as a valid occupation of scholars. There was, nevertheless, a need for a common ground on which to record and exchange our ideas of where this new mode of scholarship was leading us; hence the print journal Computers and the Humanities.	association for computers and the humanities;digital humanities;nonlinear system;printing	Joseph Raben	2010			political science;social science;social change	HPC	-63.900801342943325	-19.761507885704447	34493

5505af5f534fbb8f7ae158318347d04ea0785cd2	leveraging on mobile business to enhance firm performance: an organizational level study		Advancements in mobile technologies leverage the potential of m-business to impact organizational performance. This study aims at identifying the determinants of m-business usage and its impact on the firm’s performance. The Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE), Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) and Resource-Based View (RBV) theories ground this research’s conceptual model for assessing the value of m-business in an organizational context. Two different methodologies are combined in this study. The first consists on an exploratory study based on expert interviews to define m-business value and the impacts that its usage may have on the organization. The second develops a nomological net to assess m-business usage and value. The measurement and structural models are then tested using structural equation modelling as implemented in Smart PLS based on the data of 180 Portuguese organizations. Results show that compatibility and complexity are not among the factors that are antecedents of mbusiness usage, while relative advantages, technology competence, technology integration, managerial obstacles, competitive pressure, low partner pressure and mobile environment are significant antecedents of m-business usage. Additionally, supporting the results from the interviews, impacts on the procurement dimension is less significant than impacts on the marketing and sales and internal operations dimensions of m-business value.	procurement;structural equation modeling;theory	Winnie Picoto;France Belanger;António Palma-dos-Reis	2012			mobile business development;leverage (finance);conceptual model;knowledge management;organizational performance;marketing;technology integration;exploratory research;mobile technology;computer science;procurement	HCI	-82.15440167433178	4.080684060113789	34778

Drawing from social construction theories of technology, this research uses the grounded theory approach to analyze press coverage of this emerging technology from 2006 through the first months of 2009. While the specifics of Twitter may be new, this research demonstrates that the public response to this web tool is similar to the public reaction to earlier communication technologies including the telegraph, radio and the internet. Despite vocal skepticism from some, the research shows newspapers, magazines and blogs have promoted and actively encouraged Twitter’s diffusion.	blog;internet;theory	Noah Arceneaux;Amy Schmitz Weiss	2010	New Media & Society	10.1177/1461444809360773	public relations;social science;computer science;marketing;microblogging;advertising;world wide web	HCI	-81.897200260402	-17.025631668748268	35009

The system was designed by a European consortium led by a Spanish polytechnic in cooperation with two universities in Lima and the Peruvian Ministry of Health. The purpose of the system was to improve health conditions by extending science-based medicine into a region with well-established traditional healing practices. The central analytical focus of this article is on the interplay between the public health care system, which used the telemedicine system, and local health care practices. The manner in which scientific medicine was delivered through information technology and public health care services is analyzed in terms of the health personnel's activity, the local population's conceptions of health, and the trajectories followed by patients seeking recovery. The author participated in the design of the second evaluation of the telemedicine system and acted as a participant observer in the regional hospital and peripheral clinics. In addition to interviewing health care staff from the study area, the author also met with traditional healers, and patients in the districts whether or not they were involved in the telemedicine project. New institutional theory provided the analytical framework for the interpretation of the observed behavior of the public health care staff, traditional healers, and potential patients. Empirically, this study describes the informal aspects of the functioning of the telemedicine system, and its partial mismatch with the definitions of health and illness employed by local communities and healers.#R##N##R##N#An argument is made that people's construction of their health, which is embedded in their normal patterns of action, should be identified, and then considered in the design, implementation, and evaluation of future telemedicine projects. This article problematizes an approach to telemedicine-based health development that is weakly accountable to local social contexts and their diversity.

We leverage natural language processing (NLP) techniques analysis emotion of comment and retweet in the text, and combined with the other attributes and behaviour of the Weibo users who interact with the corporate account to research the relationships on social media. The results show that customer image has a direct impact on customer satisfaction and has an indirect impact on customer loyalty. Customer loyalty is impacted by customer satisfaction and behaviour intention. The influence of customer image on behaviour intention and loyalty and the influence of customer satisfaction on behaviour intention are not very significant. As the results suggest, Shanghai Peace Hotel needs to more widely publicise their corporation, such as with celebrity endorsement (Lv et al., 2013).	comment (computer programming);customer relationship management;natural language processing;social media;word lists by frequency	Haixia Lv;Guang Yu;Gang Wu	2018	IJITM	10.1504/IJITM.2018.092879	marketing;leverage (finance);engineering;customer satisfaction;corporation;service quality;loyalty;loyalty business model;social media	AI	-87.71726848354541	-12.526574285106571	35082
4611ea323d313fbcaecfdd94105973e0d9e8cfec	exploring the influence of social ties and perceived privacy on trust in a social media learning community		Social media has exploded in recent years and new types of interactions happen all the time. People share photos, knowledge, and personal feelings, and receive replies, comments, and feedback. Social media could now be used to build learning communities. However, before this can happen, users must trust the platform and it must protect the privacy of the users. This study explored the determinants of social media trust. It was hypothesized that social ties and perceived privacy influenced users trust in social media. A survey was distributed to 278 undergraduate students. The results showed that social ties had a direct, significant, and positive relationship with trust in social media (β=0.18, p<0.01), and perceived privacy had a direct, significant, and positive relationship with trust in social media (β=0.31, p<0.001) and with social ties (β=0.28, p<0.05). The reduced R-square values for trust and social ties were 0.16 and 0.076, respectively. The implications of these findings are discussed.	security through obscurity;social media	Wendy Wing Lam Chan;Will Wai-Kit Ma	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-39750-9_13	social learning;internet privacy;social psychology	HCI	-86.9131795137207	-18.788079834790633	35095

Keeping up with this demand became substantially more difficult when it could no longer be satisfied by a single disk, and since netnews is incidental to SLAC’s research mission, we wanted to find a solution that could easily scale to meet future growth while requiring minimal system administration effort. In the process of evaluating the various solutions that were proposed, we developed benchmarks to measure performance for this specialized application, and were surprised to find that some of our beliefs and intuition were not supported by the facts. The alternatives considered by SLAC are described, as are the benchmarks developed to evaluate the alternatives, and the results of those benchmarks. While netnews is the application we examined, our experience will hopefully provide inspiration for others to more carefully evaluate their applications instead of using stock benchmarks that may not correlate well with the intended use. Our results may also break down some biases and encourage the reader to consider alternatives which might otherwise have been ignored.	benchmark (computing);disk space;email;netapp filer;server (computing);spooling;system administrator;usenet	Karl L.

However, because most corporate sustainability research using content analysis is based on human coding, the research capability and the scope of the research design has limitations. The relatively recent text mining technique addresses some of the limitations of manual content analysis but its usage is often dependent upon the development of a domain specific dictionary. This paper develops an environmental sustainability dictionary in the context of corporate sustainability reports for the IT industry. In support of building said dictionary, we develop a standardized dictionary building process model that can be applied across many domains.	dictionary;process modeling;text mining	Qi Deng;Mike Hine;Shaobo Ji;Sujit Sur	2017			text mining;computer science;data science;data mining;corporate social responsibility	HCI	-76.92427838741824	-0.2778866263345802	35127

Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses a literature-based analysis of the critical realism concepts of a stratified social reality, the importance of contextualisation, and the relation between structure and agency. These features are discussed in relation to various models of information-seeking behaviour, but also to the “interpretative” approach to information as meaning which can only be achieved through discourses in a human community. Findings – The critical realism perspective could lay a fruitful foundation for an interdisciplinary research field like LIS, and its user studies in particular, concerned with many levels of information creation, seeking, use and processing. It is the task of the LIS researcher to explain the mechanisms that influence the information seeking, not only on an empirical level, by observing the user and his/her discourse community, but also by revealing possible underlying causes and relations. Originality/value – An awareness of the fact that social and cultural structures exist independent of one’s knowledge of them has implications on how many central problems in the LIS field are regarded	information seeking;library and information science;social reality;usability testing	Marianne Wikgren	2005	Journal of Documentation	10.1108/00220410510577989	library science;reality;social science;philosophical realism;design methods;epistemology;information theory;information science;critical realism;social theory;sociology	AI	-73.38319580593773	-18.52862678781748	35138

This paper, however, examines information processing behaviors within a Fortune 500 organization that experienced a substantial downsizing, namely, a drastic reduction in both financial and human resources. Addressed in this predownsizing and postdownsizing context were the following research questions: To what extent does the fit between an individual's information processing activities and task work predict not being laid off during an organizational downsizing?, and, Will the information processing behaviors of the individuals constrict in response to the downsizing? Results indicate that individuals in the predownsizing context who exhibited a better fit between their information processing behaviors and their task environment were more likely to have both retained their jobs and constricted their information processing behaviors after the downsizing episode. However, even with these constricted information behaviors, the retained employees appear to be adjusting to their new work context and, in fact, may be exhibiting better overall fit than was exhibited prior to the downsizing episode.	information processing;job stream	Mary R.

Often such information is not located in a single web site, data center, or even a single agency, but distributed across the Federal Government. Linking such information across the breadth of interagency holdings can increase understanding of the complexity of those holdings and their inter-relationships and allow a more cohesive presentation of all of the material.	data center;web page	Curt Tilmes;Ana Pinheiro Privette;Jeffrey Chen;Rahul Ramachandran;Kaylin M.

I begin with Walter Benjamin’s notion that the rise of the private individual can be indexed to the set of practices that transform the dwelling place into an interiorization of the external world through the collection of images and objects while at the same time acting as a place of refuge from the external world. Linking those observations to Raymond Williams’ notion of mobile privatization, I argue that the contradictory impulses of moving through the world while retreating from it are the product of economic and social structures which act to isolate individuals from each other while connecting them to the products of corporate media, and do not arise from any inherent traits within cellular phone technology.	mobile phone;television	Stephen Groening	2010	New Media & Society	10.1177/1461444810362094	psychology;social science;telecommunications;computer science;marketing;sociology;advertising;television;law	HCI	-78.27801206621388	-13.508485684010209	35245

While historically movements had to rely on traditional media to connect with such publics, via social media any user can share content, helping to connect the key players within the movement to new publics. The quality of highly shared content, however, has been under scrutiny. The #BlackLivesMatter movement, one of the most prolific and popular hashtag movements on Twitter, is examined as a case study, in order to determine the role of content importance and emotion on the virality of the movement. Four aspects of importance were examined – Policy or Action, Group, Social Actor and Politics– as well as direction of sentiment. Findings suggest important tweets were more likely to be retweeted, where tweets associated with Policy or Action showing the strongest relationship with retweeting. Tweets with expressed emotion were more likely to be retweeted than neutral tweets. When tweets contained important content related to Policy or Action or a Group as well as sentiment, these tweets were most likely to be retweeted, revealing a method for social movements to increase effectiveness. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

For many, it is hard to imagine life without the convenience and efficiencies of mobile technology. However, mobile technologies also change the traditional spatial and temporal boundaries between work and non-work, resulting in more permeable boundaries in which work is completed during personal time and non-work is conducted on-line during working hours. The demand for an increasingly networked and connected workforce also has the disadvantage of managers experiencing the stress of always being connected to the workplace and being unable to """" escape. """" Added to this demand are the addictive properties associated with the allure of simply being connected. chapter, co-written by the authors of this article, discusses the effects of mobile connectivity. Although it is entirely different from this article, it uses some of the data from phase one of this study but compares two global banks (one based in the U.S. and one based in Paris) to examine the impact of BlackBerry usage on employee stress.

454c63ad4b5ae765bbb5c819d4a869ff3141b630	regulating social network services for lawful interception		Lawful interception has evolved over the past decades from the target based monitoring and interception of telecomm conversations, to the monitoring and interception of packet switched communications. The lawful monitoring and interception of both telecomm and packet switched communications is regulated by law enforcement agencies, with the cooperation, under the Lawful Interception regulation and legislation, of the service providers. Social networks are also a means of communicating; but the nature of communication therein is extremely more complex, as it allows both for linear communication (one to one) and broadcasting of information (one to many/crowd) to selected groups and communities. Social networks are a haven for criminals and insurgents. The open nature of the media provides criminals with ample access to potential victims and provides insurgents with a virtual Hyde Park, where they can openly voice their opinions, gain followers and instigate and organize disruptive activities. The nature of the communication within social networks, the ease of establishing fake identities therein, the fact that the client-server communication can be encrypted, and the huge amount of data that passes through these networks on a daily basis however, are far from law-enforcement friendly. Furthermore, the fact that social networks are operated by commercial, usually foreign based, companies, which do not necessarily adhere to the local Lawful Interception legislation and regulation, increases the challenge of monitoring of communication with social		Esti Peshin	2013		10.1007/978-3-319-14289-0_9	computer science;data mining;computer security;computer network	Web+IR	-80.93495243483225	-14.315834415503527	35349

An operational risk management system (ORMS) is set up, which based on case-based reasoning (CBR) methods. The frame of operational risk management system is presented. Some key techniques associated with the CBR method are discussed, such as the case representation structure and case retrieve methods, which are designed under Basel II. Finally, the functional modules and some sub-functional modules are laid out, which are developed in accordance with the process of operational risk management.	case-based reasoning;management system;problem solving;risk management	Qian Chen;Jinlin Li;Lun Ran	2009	2009 Second International Workshop on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining	10.1109/WKDD.2009.32	case-based reasoning;risk analysis;it risk management;risk management;knowledge management;data mining;management system;management science;risk management information systems;enterprise risk management;risk management framework;risk management plan;operational risk	ML	-70.71127875252229	4.155734567437502	35358

She thoroughly explores their ‘dark side’ and how, although based on purposes of efficiency and control, over-relying on them can lead to difficulties. She shows how they reduce reality and exclude managers’ feelings, intuition and context, beguiling them into making decisions based on incomplete data. She insists that risk remains an elusive, unpredictable and dynamic entity, and that risk management techniques such as risk registers legitimate and privilege one way of seeing to the detriment of others. They are not amenable to translation, and their notation becomes the way of seeing risk, leading to an illusion of control. She uses recent examples to illustrate her point further, such as Toyota’s product failure and recall of faulty cars. Suggesting that risk registers should carry a health warning, she offers novel metaphors (ghosts/shadows, mutation, imp and irony) as a way to warn managers of their dangers. This is fundamentally sensible advice. Her main argument is that information and knowledge can only be seen as ‘perspectival’ and thus that risk registers are metaphors rather than full representations of reality. This is a well-known argumentation, fully articulated by science and technology studies scholars in particular. Here, Drummond uses instead a concept associated with systems theory, ‘metonymy’, to explain how some things become obscured, and registers are only partial representations. She combines systems and informational perspectives to critically examine managers’ experiences in creating, maintaining and using risk registers, and how social and economic connotations are merely translated into descriptors and numerical probabilities. She also combines these informational and systemic aspects (sum of parts, surplus reality, aggregation and standardization) with psychological concepts such as perception, bias, symbolism, rituals, demonstration of competence and information overload as a way of explaining the difficulties managers encounter when producing, interpreting, and acting upon risk registers. Through this analysis, Drummond finally makes the case that only risk that can be known, predicted and managed tends to be taken into consideration in risk management. This is done convincingly and resonates with much IS research on the limitations of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) to support (if not automate) managerial decision-making, from early Management Information Systems (MIS) (Ackoff, 1967) to knowledge management (Walsham, 2001). But there is a difference between managerial technologies at large and risk management in particular. Beyond the usual limitations identified and clearly illustrated by Drummond, risk management is part of a broader societal change, which has been explored by various scholars and deserves to be related to the limitations of scientific representation and the illusion of control exposed in her article. The following briefly outlines some of the main concepts from the literature on risk overlooked in Drummond’s analysis, which can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of risk management and its many paradoxes.	advice (programming);dark avenger;experience;information systems;information overload;knowledge management;management information system;numerical analysis;processor register;risk assessment;risk management;systems theory	Nathalie N.

Because of the important role being played by social networks, many organizations are turning to the use of social network systems to help manage these social networks and the accompanying social capital. When a social networking system is implemented in an organization, it may serve as a signal to organizational actors that social capital, heretofore largely ignored and invisible, will hereafter represent an important resource for the organization. As a result, individuals may consciously manipulate the system to either increase their own social capital or decrease the value of others' social capital. In a case study of two organizations in the process of adopting an SAP-based social networking system, our research examines how groups of actors develop strategies to control the social networking system as well as the symbolic capital that emerges during the adoption of the system.

Design/methodology/approach – The citation data were drawn from references of each article of JOD during 1998 and 2008. Ulrich’s Periodicals Directory, Library of Congress Subject Heading, retrieved from the WorldCat and LISA database were used to identify the main class, subclass and subject of cited journals and books. Findings – The results of this study revealed that journal articles are the most cited document, followed by books and book chapters, electronic resources, and conference proceedings, respectively. The three main classes of cited journals in JOD papers are library science, science, and social sciences. The three subclasses of non-LIS journals that were highly cited in JOD papers are Science, “Mathematics. Computer science”, and “Industries. Land use. Labor”. The three highly cited subjects of library and information science journals encompass searching, information work, and online information retrieval. The most cited main class of books in JOD papers is library and information science, followed by social sciences, science, “Philosophy. Psychology. Religion.” The three highly cited subclasses of books in JOD papers are “Books (General). Writing. Paleography. Book industries and trade. Libraries. Bibliography,” “Philology and linguistics,” and Science, and the most cited subject of books is information storage and retrieval systems. Originality/value – Results for the present research found that information science, as represented by JOD, is a developing discipline with an expanding literature relating to multiple subject areas.	apple lisa;bibliometrics;book;citation analysis;computer data storage;computer science;documentation;information retrieval;library (computing);library and information science;library of congress subject headings;library science;worldcat	Ming-yueh Tsay;Zhu-yee Shu	2011	Journal of Documentation	10.1108/00220411111164682	library science;land use;design methods;information science;computer science;citation analysis;world wide web;information retrieval	NLP	-76.44085918596319	-21.051662728341697	35523

This article summarizes previous studies to develop a theoretical framework useful to describe and classify competitive intelligence practices. It is applied to study CI practices developed by Spanish universities, comparing usual practices with those developed during the process of adaptation of degrees to the European Higher Education Area, with strong challenges. Design/methodology/approach. The research employs a mixed-methods approach (semistructured interviews and questionnaires) developed in two phases. It has focused on the academic offer, which represents 46.35% of the degrees presented in 2009, belonging to 90.16% of Spanish universities. Findings. The results reveal predominance of incipient and reactive practices, oriented to the tactical level. During the adaptation process, these practices evolved due to the perception of the involvement of universities in the adaptation process. In addition, the proposed theoretical 2 framework could be a tool to study competitive intelligence both in other university management areas and other kind of organisations. Practical implications. This framework based on research done in business sector can be applied to any kind or organizations, including NGO and public sectors. Originality. Management tools used in the business sector, such as competitive intelligence (CI), have been adopted by Higher Educations Institutions, but while competitive intelligence has been studied in depth in the business sector, it has scarcely been studied in higher education. This framework can be applied to any kind or organizations.	reactive planning	Montserrat Garcia-Alsina;Josep Cobarsí-Morales;Eva Ortoll	2015	Aslib J. Inf.

We believe that this (hopefully) growing awareness is a very welcome development. However, we will argue that the particular and increasing importance of authorship and the harmful implications of current practices of research authorship for junior researchers have not been emphasised enough. We will use the case of our own research area (bioethics) to illustrate some of the pitfalls of current publishing practices-in particular, the impact on the evaluation of one's work in the area of employment or funding. Even where there are explicit guidelines, they are often disregarded. This disregard, which is often exemplified through the inflation of co-authorship in some research areas, may seem benign to some of us; but it is not. Attribution of co-authorship for reasons other than merit in relation to the publication misrepresents the work towards that publication, and generates unfair competition. We make a case for increasing awareness, for transparency and for more explicit guidelines and regulation of research co-authorship within and across research areas. We examine some of the most sensitive areas of concern and their implications for researchers, particularly junior ones, and we suggest several strategies for future action.

An evaluation is made of their potential to satisfy the ideal of deliberative democracy in which a discussion that contains an exchange of opinions is highly estimated. A further focus is on to what extent they are used by citizens for co-ordinating political activities. In a large majority of the forums, the on-line debate was dominated by political issues, rather than conversation in general. Also, in a large majority of the forums most of the contributions were part of a dialogue. Both these results are in accordance with the ideal of deliberative democracy. However, with a few exceptions the forums were not used by citizens for co-ordinating political activities. As thus, these experiences give a rather nuanced picture of the democratic potential of on-line forums.	experience;online and offline;situated	Agneta Ranerup	2000		10.1109/DEXA.2000.875043	politics;law;satisfiability	NLP	-81.70630282450702	-14.869308956656713	35626

The required data were gathered via two checklists were devised for the purpose of this research and each of which was dedicated to “Shahname” and “Nahjolbalaghe”. Also, to determine the characteristics of a suitable functional requirements for bibliographic records (FRBR) model for Iran, 18 implementation projects round the world were surveyed and analysed. Results of the study show that some FRBR requirements were readily available in Persian bibliographic records (PBRs), but in some cases, there are some deficiencies due to some likely reasons, such as lack of commitment to the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules 2, specifications of the library software structure and neglecting bibliographic and family relations in catalogues.rnrnrnrnrnDesign/methodology/approachrnrnrnrnrnThe main goal of this research was to identify the degree of compatibility of the current situation of the PBRs with FRBR, as well as identifying the possible approaches and strategies for appropriate application of the model to Persian records.

1248d054bf5b8174742eb18f476cc3727f279b5c	big gis analytics framework for agriculture supply chains: a literature review identifying the current trends and future perspectives		Abstract The world population is estimated to reach nine billion by 2050. Many challenges are adding pressure on the current agriculture supply chains that include shrinking land sizes, ever increasing demand for natural resources and environmental issues. The agriculture systems need a major transformation from the traditional practices to precision agriculture or smart farming practices to overcome these challenges. Geographic information system (GIS) is one such technology that pushes the current methods to precision agriculture. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review (SLR) of 120 research papers on various applications of big GIS analytics (BGA) in agriculture. The selected papers are classified into two broad categories; the level of analytics and GIS applications in agriculture. The GIS applications viz., land suitability, site search and selection, resource allocation, impact assessment, land allocation, and knowledge-based systems are considered in this study. The outcome of this study is a proposed BGA framework for agriculture supply chain. This framework identifies big data analytics to play a significant role in improving the quality of GIS application in agriculture and provides the researchers, practitioners, and policymakers with guidelines on the successful management of big GIS data for improved agricultural productivity.	geographic information system	Rohit Sharma;Sachin S.

Although the now rather commonplace risks of security breaches (such as falsification of student records, and access to examination or assignment files) are real and still occur, this type of violation has become a small part of an insidious spectrum of creative computer-based student offenses. Academic institutions have responded to this threat by developing integrity policies that typically use punitive methods to discourage cheating, plagiarism , and other forms of misconduct. For example, in December 1997, the Testing Center staff at New Jersey's Mercer County Community College discovered that eight calculus students had been issued variants of """" a multi-version multiple-choice test, but submitted responses that were appropriate for a completely different set of questions. By falsely coding the test version, they triggered computer scoring of their responses as if they had been given a version of the test which they in fact had never been given. """" 1 The students were suspended, and the Center restructured its system to thwart this sort of deception. This particular incident is noteworthy, because it demonstrates the technological savvy used to circumvent the grading in a course whose tuition was a mere $300, and whose knowledge was essential for further studies. Tangentially , it also provides an illustration of the vulnerability of multi-version mark-sense tallying, a system used in an ever-increasing number of municipalities for voting, a much higher-stakes application. 2 The proliferation of affordable computer systems is both a boon and a headache for educators. The great wealth of information available via Internet and Web is a tremendous asset in course preparation and presentation , but its downside is that teachers need to stay one screen dump ahead of their students in order to issue projects requiring original solutions. Faculty members bemoan the accessibility of term-paper banks, where thousands of boilerplate essays can be downloaded for a small fee. For the more affluent (or desperate) student, there are """" writers """" who will provide a custom work that conforms to the most stringent of professorial requirements. Although assignment fraud has always existed, it is now easier and more tempting. In-class writing projects can establish some level of control, but with net-worked lab rooms, individual contributions become difficult to monitor—as soon as someone solves a problem , it quickly propagates to the …"""	accessibility;computer;information security;internet;requirement;screenshot;web	Rebecca T.

This is also very evident for Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) worldwide. Driving by the need to improve student experience, Learning Analytics (LA) has been a rapidly growing area of interest in UK HEIs. However, there is very limited literature on the use and impact of LA in the Higher Education sector. This research aims to close this gap by developing a better understanding of the use and impact of LA on student experience management. A qualitative methodology is employed by adopting an exploratory case study and semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders across UK HEIs.

This field study in the upstream oil and gas industry focused on challenges in the coordination of highly interdependent tasks if teams work remotely on an ongoing basis. Based on 78 semi-structured interviews and observations over a period of 12 months, we identified coordination requirements for primary team activities, as well as effects of changing media capabilities to overcome difficulties of ongoing distribution. Implications for media requirements in the support of ongoing distributed teams are discussed.	colocation centre;defense in depth (computing);distributed manufacturing;email;field research;interdependence;loose coupling;requirement;semiconductor industry;server (computing);telecommuting	Petra Saskia Bayerl;Kristina Lauche	2010	Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)	10.1007/s10606-010-9107-x	simulation;teamwork;knowledge management;team effectiveness;communication;management;computer-mediated communication;field research	HCI	-87.70980439193528	0.30528225332713016	35804

This shift to low-cost distribution of research literature has opened up new possibilities for increasing the accessibility and potential readership of published literature. Open Access is a term used to refer to publication of scholarly material without access restrictions, which can be realized either by the publisher directly or indirectly by the author. This paper studies the extent to which information systems research is available Open Access. The results are also contrasted to figures from other areas of science. By sampling journals within the field, systematically looking for free copies through a web search engine, the extent of peer-reviewed IS research was studied. The results indicate that none of the IS journals included in a large citation indexing service covering 18000 journals are fully Open Access, but this is something which is compensated for by authors being quite active in uploading copies of their manuscripts to web sites. There was no significant difference in Open Access patterns between the top journals in the discipline and the rest of the sample. The overall share of Open Access within the field is 21 %. 1.1 Introduction Open Access (OA) is a term used to refer to free unrestricted access of scientific publications and data in electronic format retrievable over the Internet. For good overviews of the subject see for example Suber (2010) or Willinsky (2005). The term Open Access was coined in 2002 at a meeting in Budapest (BOAI 2002), but the concept has existed since the earliest days of the Internet (Harnad 1995). As soon as the web emerged many scientists rapidly saw its potential for making the sharing of scientific information, in particular peer reviewed journal articles, more efficient. Free unrestricted access is sometimes used to mean not only access for readers, but also for systems for data mining and indexing (Wilbanks 2006). Creative Commons licenses (Creative Commons 2010), which have strong similarities to the licenses used for Open Source software, are often used to define what readers can do with the articles published in OA journals. OA is related to a number of rather similar phenomena that have emerged along with the widespread adoption of the Internet such as Open Source, Open Content, Peer Production, Social Media etc. (Benkler 2006). An important feature distinguishing the subject domain of OA from other publishing industries such …	accessibility;citation index;data mining;free license;global serializability;indexing and abstracting service;information systems research;internet;open content;open-source software;printing;sampling (signal processing);scientific literature;snapshot (computer storage);social media;software repository;systems theory;upload;web search engine	Bo-Christer Björk;Patrik Welling;Mikael Laakso	2011			publishing;law;world wide web;information retrieval;information system	Web+IR	-70.54729744322854	-21.236889976926644	35834

A barrier and risk ontology was established from a critical literature review process. In order to examine this theoretical model, the study employed a deductive research design based on a cross-sectional questionnaire survey. The survey received 84 responses from 42 Chinese firms. The findings identified that organizational barriers are often the main triggers of other ERP barriers and risks, including the system ones. The study thus concluded and suggested that Chinese companies need to pay substantial attention to the organizational barriers identified, since properly managing this type of obstacle may potentially help them to mitigate and remove other ERP challenges and risks and thus ensuring long-term success in ERP post-adoption.	cross-sectional data;erp;enterprise resource planning;theory;web ontology language	Guo Chao Peng;José Miguel Baptista Nunes	2010	2010 43rd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2010.240	questionnaire;risk analysis;knowledge management;ontology;artificial intelligence;data mining;cross section;management;statistics	SE	-81.17750530043277	3.3273808370383797	35862

069cb406fd3a2704416326c5e90856f4e582e856	looking through the clouds: a tale of two universities	cloud computing;outsourcing	Cloud computing has become a popular buzzword and a trend in the IT industry. With characteristic features of scalable computing resources on-demand, and accessibility on a pay-per-use basis, it has been promoted as the harbinger of good tidings to its subscribers, such as the minimization of inhouse IT infrastructures, substantial cost savings, and diminished administrative hurdles, thereby appearing as an appealing outsourcing proposition for non-IT enterprises, such as universities. This paper presents a comparative case study of two universities, one in Australia (UniOz) and one in Sweden (UniSwed). The two universities illustrate examples of how contemporary organisations interpret cloud computing, of drivers behind moving services into the cloud, and of prevailing concerns. Similarities pertaining to drivers for cloud computing are identified at the two cases (seeking scalable computing resources, and the re-allocation of IT resources to focus on core enterprise operations, with an aim to trim costs). This is identified in spite of differences in the culture of respective IT departments. Differences were also identified in terms of student vs. staff driven sourcing of services (email), and early vs. late adoption. The case study also illustrates interesting patterns in terms of the organisational implications of cloud services over time that calls for longitudinal studies. The implication of this paper is three-fold; two cases are consistent with outsourcing theories, they point to a transformation of the status quo, rather than an erosion of the role and influence of the internal IT department, and also reveals gaps in outsourcing theories and a possible future research direction in strengthening the relevant theoretical framework.

They review the contribution points out that what a person learns about a new qualities of the basic level of categorization illustrating that it category is greatly influenced by what a person knows about is more than just cue validity. They discuss a number of probother, related categories. This resonates with the theorizing of lems of hierarchical structures, among them the problem of William Cooper (1971), largely forgotten today, that to search transitivity. For example, ‘‘car seat’’ is widely viewed as a online is to deduce. Online searching is a process that combines chair, and ‘‘chair’’ is widely viewed as a type of furniture, but the searcher’s background and deductive mechanisms.

Between conferences, I hear this time and time again, usually most loudly from people least qualified to know the truth of such remarks. In some organizations, this takes on the momentum of a self-fulfilling prophecy, usually promoted by those who have something to gain from ending the use of APL.Similarly, people often express surprise when I tell them I develop software in APL. The most common answers I get are """"You can't be serious! Is APL still available?"""" or """"I thought that was only on mainframes!"""" or """"Really? When I was in school, I really liked APL, but no one uses it anymorel, so I now program in ____.""""Moreover, I'm sure the great majority of us have had similar experiences; although each of these experiences may be anecdotal, taken together they highlight questions about the health of the APL community.Instead of looking inward, and engaging in exercises such as trying to determine the number of APL programmers in the world, or becoming defensive about who we are and what we have to offer, I decided to take a look outside our little corner and examine two other populations that have re-invigorated themselves. Specifically, I will recount briefly the stories of the LISP community, and the """"Free Software"""" community, as lead by Linux. We'll see if we can draw some lessons, perhaps a common message from this. Is there something we can call an """"APL community""""? If so, can it be re-envigorated?

One area, however, where little work has been done is the application of autopoietic theory to knowledge management. The paper aims to provide a direct comparison between the theory of autopoiesis with aspects of knowledge management, specifically social constructivism.Design/methodology/approach – The theory of autopoiesis was broken down into easily comparable sections. The theory of social constructivism in relation to knowledge management was then described, followed by a comparison of the two.Findings – Strong correlations were discovered between autopoiesis and knowledge management, specifically that the cyclical nature of organisational learning and its ability to self‐reproduce the components of its system suggest that it is in some respect an autopoietic entity. However, serious flaws between the two approaches were discovered also.Originality/value – This paper is the first in‐depth application of autopoiesis to knowledge managemen...	autopoiesis;knowledge management	Thomas W.

07384f05f770024ecddd76926f64aa669d05e1dc	why amazon uses both the new york times best seller list and customer reviews: an empirical study of multiplier effects on product sales from multiple earned media	multiplier effects of earned media;digital ecosystem;traditional media;integrated marketing communication imc;social media;electronic word of mouth	In today's dynamic media landscape, products are reviewed by consumers in social media and reported by journalists in traditional media. This paper will focus on the relationship among the two types of “earned” media and product sales. Previous studies have focused on either traditional or social earned media, but rarely both. We will aim to bridge that gap using the following points of analysis: the New York Times Best Seller List as traditional media; Amazon user reviews as social media; and book purchases through Amazon as product sales. We find that: (1) both traditional and social earned media influence sales; (2) sales have a reciprocal effect on social earned media; and (3) traditional and social earned media influence each other. Communication through multiple media is known to produce the “synergy effect” in which one media activity enhances the effect of another. Our results suggest a new benefit unique to the use of multiple earned media. We call this the “multiplier effect,” which occurs when one earned media activity increases the level of another by becoming a “sounding board” that amplifies positive messages, as well as a bridge that allows messages to propagate freely in an interactive media system. Therefore, multiple earned media produce combined sales effects greater than those resulting from the sum of their parts. This analysis supports Amazon's decision to use multiple earned media to benefit from an ecosystem where product sales and earned media both influence and are influenced by one another. The paper will address the implications for marketing communication and media industry.	the new york times	Tong Bao;Tung-lung Steven Chang	2014	Decision Support Systems	10.1016/j.dss.2014.07.004	public relations;media relations;social media;economics;computer science;marketing;advertising;management;world wide web	ECom	-85.78332732405015	-12.991897134105972	36508
6029c0bebe310d19cdf541908be7ace88cbc4f8e	the spatial politics of radio: anna friz's critical utopias		Since the late 1990s, the Canadian radio artist and scholar Anna Friz has been making ‘self-reflexive radio’, an artform in which radio is the source, subject, and medium of the work. This article explores Friz’s selfreflexive radio practice as it develops in relation to a language and an aesthetics of place and non-place. It maintains that Friz’s works enact an oppositional spatial strategy within supermodernism or informational capitalism (i.e. the Information Age). In an era in which information is considered to be the most valuable currency, Friz’s noisy, superfluous, and transceptive transmissions disrupt and divert the relentless, unidirectional information flows that dominate the airwaves. In particular, Friz’s works enact a critical and feminist radio utopia that recovers the lost ‘places’—the grounded bodies and the point-to-point networks—that are essential to radio communications, but that are toooften subsumed within contemporary informational exchanges.

Privacy policies provide an opportunity to promote consumer trust for popular uses of the web especially given the proliferation of online privacy breaches. One such use for which consumer trust and privacy is of growing concern is electronic government. This study assesses the contents and reading complexity of privacy policies posted by the US state government websites. The findings show that the lack of standardisation and complexity may pose as impediments to consumer trust in the use of these sites.	e-government;privacy policy	Shirley Ann Becker	2005	EG	10.1504/EG.2005.007782	personally identifiable information;public relations;privacy software;privacy policy;information privacy;privacy by design;computer science;internet privacy;privacy;world wide web;computer security;commerce;information privacy law	Security	-83.01842061683405	-12.111484632444935	36611

The primary aim of this article is to qualify time and Internet use of Italian Generation Y beyond media hype and assumptions. To this aim, we apply a multidimensional extension of Item Response Theory models to the Italian “Multipurpose survey on households: aspects of daily life” to ascertain the relevant dimensions of Generation Y time-use. We show that the use of technology is neither the first nor the foremost time-use activity of Italian Generation Y, who still prefers to use its time to socialise and have fun with friends in a non media-medalled manner.	foremost;internet;item response theory;socialization	Michela Gnaldi;Simone Del Sarto	2017	CoRR		item response theory;mathematics;marketing;econometrics;the internet;research question;quality of life	ECom	-86.15427900665674	-23.18685620795498	36687

This aid flows through a humanitarian system that consists of governments, different United Nations agencies, the Red Cross movement and myriad non-governmental organizations (NGOs). As scarcer resources, financial crisis and economic inter-dependencies continue to constrain humanitarian relief there is an increasing focus from donors and governments to assess the impact of humanitarian supply networks. Using commercial (`for-profit') supply networks as a benchmark; this paper exposes the counter-intuitive competition dynamic of humanitarian supply networks, which results in an open-loop system unable to calibrate supply with actual need and impact. In that light, the phenomenon of Big Data in the humanitarian field is discussed and an agenda for the `datafication' of the supply network set out as a means of closing the loop between supply, need and impact.	benchmark (computing);big data;charge-coupled device;closing (morphology);closing the loop;datafication;feedback;internet access;money;velocity (software development);veracity	Asmat Monaghan;Mark Lycett	2013	2013 IEEE Global Humanitarian Technology Conference (GHTC)	10.1109/GHTC.2013.6713725	humanitarian logistics;engineering;operations management;economy;commerce	Mobile	-75.7128144820371	-9.2396091654896	36753

Design/methodology/approach – Recursive analysis of email interactions is offered as a case to account for the knowledge structure evolution related to the different programs of international non-governmental organization (INGO). Several methods are used: analysis of the network expansion to see whether the process is random or uniform is performed, visualisation of the network configuration changes throughout studied time period; and the statistical examination of network formation. Findings – The results of the presented study indicate that content structure of electronic knowledge networks exhibits hierarchical and centralised tendencies. The social network analysis results suggest that INGO exhibits non-hierarchical and decentralized structure of the individuals contributing to the discussion lists. Research limitations/implications – By providing the means to carry out network evolution analysis of content structure dynamics and social interactions, the presented work provides a means for probabilistically modelling patterns of organisational knowledge evolution. Practical implications – The approach allows the exploration of the dynamics of tacit to explicit knowledge, from individual to the group and from informal groups to the whole organisation. Originality/value – By displaying the large collection of the key phrases that reflected the evolution of the organisational knowledge structure over the time, organisational emails are placed in meaningful context explaining the language of the organisation and context of knowledge structure evolution.

30a5bc62e8ed11ddebfa42c72487f601e6b5d87b	self extension and the desire to preserve digital possessions		Developed from psychology and sociology, the concept of self extension means that an individuals’ concept of his or her own self can extend outside the body (Belk, 1988). While studies in the context of consumer behavior have explored many applications of self extension to material objects, self extension to digital objects has yet to be explored. Further, self extension to possessions can influence behavior and may therefore influence maintaining behavior, or the actions associated with saving or personal information for the long term. This pilot study uses Q method to explore the extension of self to digital possessions and the implications for maintaining digital possessions for the long term. Keywords Self extension, consumer behavior, digital objects, maintaining, personal information management. INTRODUCTION Belk’s concept of self extension has been explored in many areas of consumer behavior research; this research has demonstrated that self extension has the potential to influence behavior. What of maintaining behavior? According to Jones (2008) interpretation, maintaining is a meta-level personal information management (PIM) activity that exists to map information to need. While most PIM research portrays maintaining as useful to retrieve information, maintaining may serve additional purposes beyond retrieval. In addition, individuals may maintain information without clear plans for retrieval. Marshall’s (2008a, 2008b) research on personal digital archiving demonstrates that maintaining is complex and warrants further study. This pilot study begins to explore how self extension may influence conscious decisions to maintain digital possessions on personal computers by obtaining a measurement self extension levels to digital possessions. LITERATURE REVIEW Self extension to possessions is defined as “the contributions of possessions to identity,” (Sivadas & Machleit, 1994, p. 143). Russell J. Belk first linked self extension with possessions in 1988, introducing the concept to consumer behavior. Belk asserted that the self could extend to possessions, which could then influence behavior surrounding possessions, such as buying, selling, caring for and discarding. While self extension to physical possessions has been previously studied, self extension to digital possessions has yet to be explored until recently. Siddiqui and Turley (2006) studied the role of “virtual possessions” as replacements for physical possessions and found that some participants were hesitant to relinquish a physical possession (a letter, photo, song, etc.) for a purely digital one.         According to Odom, Zimmerman and Forlizzi (2011), teenagers can form attachments to their digital possessions, which has implications for human computer interaction research. Odom et. al draws on attachment as it is defined by consumer behaviorists, who consider self extension a necessary characteristic of attachment to possessions. Considering that Furby (1978) found control to be the most salient characteristic of a possession, it is likely that individuals consider some digital items to be their possessions. Previous studies have explored the meaning of personal information to individuals and how it can influence maintaining for our lives and beyond (also referred to as archiving). Kirk and Sellen (2010) explored the values behind home archiving in order to understand how and why sentimental artifacts were maintained and how archiving was used for more than to trigger remembering. The researchers found that physical and digital possessions often served as a trace of, or mechanism for, sacred things and that subjects often removed these digital artifacts from everyday use. Seven values were associated with home archiving: remembering, defining the self, forgetting, This is the space reserved for copyright notices. ASIST 2011, October 9–13, 2011, New Orleans, LA, USA. Copyright notice continues right here. fulfilling duty, framing the family, connecting with the past and honoring those we care about. Belk’s (1988) statement that self extension can influence the care of possessions can be applied to Jones’ (2008) PIM concept of maintaining for our lives and beyond. METHODS According to Brown (1993), Q method is a quantitative method to measure human subjectivity. For this pilot study, Q methodology was used to explore how the self can extend to digital possessions and to investigate the overlap between self extension and the desire to preserve digital possessions. Q method involves the development of a concourse and Qsample; Q sorting according to conditions of instruction; and statistical analysis (Brown 1993; McKeown & Thomas, 1988). To develop a concourse, 6 participants (3 males and 3 females) provided the researcher with desktop tours. These tours provided data to develop a 60-item Q sample of objects, that were placed on index cards, and then sorted by population two, according to three conditions of instruction based on Sivadas and Machleit’s (1994) study designed to test self extension using a Likert scale. The conditions of instruction were designed to explore extension to present self, future self and past self. The forth condition of instruction was designed to explore preservation values. After sorting, the statistical program PQ Method was used to conduct Q factor analysis. RESULTS Overall, 7 (3 male and 4 female) subjects completed each of the four sorts. The mean age of participants was 40.7 years. Subjects sorted the 60 item Q sample on a quasi-normal distribution ranging from -5 to +5, according to each of the four conditions of instruction. Each of the four sorts was analyzed using the computer program PQ Method, a program specifically designed for Q factor analysis. Seven subjects (for each sort) x a sixty item Q sample resulted in a 60 x 7 matrix, that PQ Method correlated using the standard Q method centroid factor analysis for each sort. A varimax rotation solution was used to rotate the matrix and find a model of best fit. Overall, digital photos in multiple contexts (...taken by me, that I share, ...of my travels, ...entire collection) scored a 3, 4 or, 5 for conditions of instruction aimed to explore past, present and future identity. Also included in all three dimensions was my Facebook account, my instant message/chat transcripts and my digital copy of my resume. As these statements have a high value rating for each dimension of self extension, they appear to be the digital possession to which individuals are most likely to extend their self. While self extension to digital photos could be predicted, self extension to a Facebook account, instant message/chat transcripts, and a digital copy of a resume was unexpected. Facebook and message transcripts help the individual connect with others, which was also found in the qualitative interviews conducted to develop the Q sample. It is important to mention, however, that some subjects did not use social media or like it, and that not all factors rated my Facebook as having a high value. In addition, during the qualitative interviews, participants stated that they did not only use social media to connect with others, the social media application represented their interests and were a tool someone could use to learn more about their interests. Regardless, this finding contrasts with that of Kirk and Sellen (2010) who found that individuals constructed self identity from digital possessions that were less likely to be publically displayed. The difference between these findings could be related to the choice of method, but also the fact that Kirk and Sellen did not categorize identity or self as past, present, and future, as was done in this study. A resume can be viewed as a document that withstands the test of time because it contains information about past and present experiences, but also serves as a document we use to help move us into the future, as in the search for a new job. Interestingly, my email folders and my sentimental emails received a high value rating for present self extension only, while my emails related to my hobbies/extracurricular activities received a high value rating for extension to the future self and extension to the past self, and my saved emails only received a high rating for past self. As was observed during the interviews, individuals took pains to organize the information related to their hobbies and personal interests, while the information related to work/or school work would go unorganized. Also of interest, while digital music was mentioned as representing identity during the interviews, it only received a 4 for factor 1 and a 3 for factor 2, for the extension to future self condition. Overall, my creative writing saved on my personal computer, my entire digital photo collection, my heirloom from my grandparent, my digital photos of my family, my collection, my digital photos of my travels were given high Figure 1. Q method: 60-item sort using a -5 to +5 quasi normal distribution. values for either past, present or future identity that represent self extension as well as for desire to preserve. My instant message/chat transcripts was the only statement listed in all orientations of self extension (past, present and future) and in factor 2 of desire to preserve. Thus, it appears that for some items, self extension and desire for preservation overlap. This study demonstrates that the self does extend to some digital possessions more than others. Follow up studies that further investigate preservation practices of the items which received the highest rankings for all temporal orientations of self extension and the highest rankings for desire to preserve may provide information on whether this desire to preserve is actually practiced. FUTURE WORK Several issues arose during the study that will be addressed in future work. Going forward, considering the results of Kirk and Sellen (2010) and the pilot study interviews, I believe that the meaning		Amber L.

However, the impact of contamination has still not been thoroughly studied from a supply chain planning perspective. This paper models a contamination event in a generic food supply chain consisting of suppliers, processing centers, and retailers. Contamination is detected through either company or government agency sampling tests or through reports of a food borne illness. In this research, we analyze the impact of origin and choice of sampling strategies, and product and supply chain attributes on a contamination event. We also simulate a real-world tomato contamination case to gain further insights.		Vijaya Chebolu-Subramanian;Gary M.

Computer supported coordination brings about changes to communicative modalities-often the change is from oral to artifact based coordination. In order to inform the designed changes in modality we need to understand the characteristics of individual modes of coordination, and we need to compare modes before changes are implemented. Within this context the paper has two objectives: (1) to characterize oral and artifact based coordination, and (2) to establish an initial set of dimensions which will support a comparison between the two modes of coordination. The basis for both points is empirical: a field study of oral coordination in maritime operations, and a study of artifact based coordination in software engineering.	computer-supported cooperative work;field research;modality (human–computer interaction);pry repl;software engineering	Peter H.

It employs an interpretive case study approach that involved collection of qualitative data through semi-structured interviews and observations. This paper illustrates the importance of national and corporate cultures in shaping those relationships within the cultural and wider industrial network context. Guanxi, a particular relationship dimension of Chinese culture, is important for the understanding of the various ways in which business relationships are managed in Chinese-based business. The findings also indicate that it is not suitable to apply foreign experiences to China without considering the cultural context.	emergence	Susanna Xu;Joe Nandhakumar	2007			knowledge management;operations management;business	NLP	-78.75842898191817	3.331706368163961	37019

The framework derives from a conceptual model for analyzing knowledge development overviewed by the authors in a previous paper. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses the conceptual framework of 13 dimensions for knowledge policy-making analysis and qualitative focus group discussions by means of what is known as a knowledge SWOT analysis. Such an exercise ordinarily determines what is termed as net strength (strengths offset by weaknesses) and net opportunity (opportunities offset by threats). Findings – The field research suggests that, whereas quantitative indicators are very commonly used for the purpose of benchmarking and progress tracking, they are limited in terms of determining causes, effects and encapsulating good practices. The present framework provides a means for policy-makers and analysts to engage in discussion, debates, story-telling and scenario building in order to understand net strengths and opportunities. Research limitations/implications – The research is limited by the time constraints of the focus group participants and it is not feasible to conduct a K-SWOT of more than the four societies used for the reason that there are insufficient numbers of informed participants. Practical implications – Developing the knowledge economy has to be more than a management of socio-economic indicators. Understanding the net strength and opportunity faced by a society in the context of a global knowledge economy allowed insights into gaps that may be addressed with appropriate knowledge policies. There is much work to be done in formulating implementable policy recommendations. Originality/value – It is hoped that a useful and valid policy analysis tool for knowledge development has thus been described.	field research;focus group;scenario analysis	Ravi S. Sharma;Ekundayo M.

However, many such systems require significant maintenance work, which also implies the need for collective action, that is, individuals following goals set by the group and performing good citizenship behaviors. How can this paradox be resolved? Here we examine one potential answer: the influence of social identification with the larger group on contributors' behavior. We examine Wikipedia, a highly successful peer production system, and find a significant and growing influence of group structure, with a prevalent example being the WikiProject. Comparison of editors who join projects with those who do not and comparisons of the joiners' behavior before and after they join a project suggest their identification with the group plays an important role in directing them towards group goals and good citizenship behaviors. Upon joining, Wikipedians are more likely to work on project-related content, to shift their contributions towards coordination rather than production work, and to perform maintenance work such as reverting vandalism. These results suggest that group influence can play an important role in maintaining the health of online communities, even when such communities are putatively self-directed peer production systems."""	identification (psychology);online community;production system (computer science);wikiproject;wikipedia	Aniket Kittur;Bryan A.

Performances associated with court activities took many forms, ranging from spectacular pageantries during ceremonies to smallscale performances in private residences in the Forbidden City. This talk draws upon the archival materials of both Qing court theater bureau and non-theatrical archives, (the Imperial Household Department, Imperial Buttery, Imperial Workshops, and more), and journals by European visitors who participated in court theatrical activities, to examine the pedagogical role of theatrical performances in state-sponsored ceremonial events during the Qianlong reign.	archive;performance	L Chen;Jeffrey Chan	2001	IEEE Software	10.1109/MS.2001.10019		AI	-63.50221953515731	-14.5607907442483	37125

This study focuses on the psychological and practical consequences of Facebook use following job loss. By pairing longitudinal surveys of Facebook users with logs of their online behavior, we examine how communication with different kinds of ties predicts improvements in stress, social support, bridging social capital, and whether they find new jobs. Losing a job is associated with increases in stress, while talking with strong ties is generally associated with improvements in stress and social support. Weak ties do not provide these benefits. Bridging social capital comes from both strong and weak ties. Surprisingly, individuals who have lost a job feel greater stress after talking with strong ties. Contrary to the """"strength of weak ties"""" hypothesis, communication with strong ties is more predictive of finding employment within three months."""	bridging (networking);job stream;social capital;social network;social support	Moira Burke;Robert E.

Companies are increasingly realizing that their knowledge base is the basis of their competitive advantage, and innovation is imperative for them to make progress. Knowledge management is now a well-established discipline in many large organizations. But what is its status and role in small and medium sized enterprises and what are the policy implications? This paper starts by summarizing the key characteristics of knowledge management. Then it is followed by a review of current understanding of knowledge management in small and medium sized enterprises. Finally it is suggested that knowledge innovation - the process of accessing, absorbing and converting knowledge into commercial products and services - is probably the most fruitful area for focus of policy initiatives.	knowledge management	John Sparrow	2011			business;knowledge management	OS	-74.88672373682009	3.847527219458834	37208

b93f5ccf63dfc1faf67e7699baa7569d59f204c1	self-presentation: signaling personal and social characteristics		When people interact, their behaviors are greatly influenced by the impressions they have of one another’s personalities, abilities, attitudes, intentions, identities, roles, and other characteristics. In fact, many important outcomes in life – outcomes as diverse as friendships, professional success, income, romantic relationships, influence over others, and social support – depend to a significant extent on the impressions that people make on others. Knowing that others respond to them on the basis of their public impressions, people devote considerable thought and energy to conveying impressions that will lead others to treat them in desired ways. In many instances, the impressions people project of themselves are reasonably accurate attempts to let other people know who they are and what they are like (Murphy, 2007). At other times, people may convey impressions of themselves that they know are not entirely accurate, if not blatantly deceptive, when they believe that fostering such images will result in desired outcomes (Hancock & Toma, 2009). Social and behavioral scientists refer to people’s efforts to manage their public images as self-presentation or impression management (Goffman, 1959; Schlenker, 2012). Some researchers use different terms for the process of controlling one’s public image depending on whether the efforts are honest or deceitful and whether they involve impressions of one’s personal characteristics or information about one’s social roles and identity. But we will use the terms interchangeably to refer to any intentional effort to convey a particular impression of oneself to another person without respect to the accuracy or content of the effort.	experiment;interaction;real life;social media;social support	Mark R.

LISREL 8.2 was used to perform confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling, employing the maximum likelihood estimation method.rnrnrnrnrnFindingsrnrnrnrnrnInstagram posts have direct and indirect effects on psychological empowerment. The indirect effect appears through two perceptual mechanisms: sense of self-efficacy and sense of community (SOC). The former provides women with a sense of mastery and control and the latter gives them the perception of belonging to a community that equips individual participants with a collective efficacy. Of the two mechanisms, the SOC plays a more significant role in creating psychological empowerment. Having a sense of virtual community, as opposed to participating in real ones, can act as catalyst in creating empowerment.rnrnrnrnrnOriginality/valuernrnrnrnrnThis study investigates the impact of a recent new technology, namely, Instagram, in regions where women are marginalized for generations. Instagram is important, because images, photo captions, short texts and hashtags are vital elements of communication in the present day. Furthermore, women are twice as likely to think highly of a brand that makes an empowering ad and are more likely to share, comment and like the ads.	instagram	Hernan Riquelme;Rosa E.

Data was collected via self-administered questionnaires and personal interviews focusing on information sources and information needs in the forestry industry. A pilot project was undertaken in order to test the questionnaire and interview schedules and resolve any problems which might arise concerning the use of these instruments. A group of regular ICFR Information Centre users, who were also all from sponsor organizations, agreed to fill in the questionnaires and be interviewed for testing purposes. As a result of the pre-test it was decided to utilize more structured responses, and to reword some of the questions in order to improve their clarity. The main findings were that IT (Information Technology) is an integral part of the forestry industry and that information and knowledge are considered to be important resources which are extensively utilized by those in the industry. ICFR publications and the library are valued and frequently used information sources. Accessibility is an important factor affecting the utilization of information. The ICFR library needs to find innovative ways to improve the accessibility of its collection. Open-ended comments suggested that the ICFR library may have a role to play in adding value to information and helping to overcome information overload. It was recommended that the ICFR should focus on the needs of its sponsoring companies, and adopt a market-driven approach, which includes advertising the products and services which it has to offer.	information audit	Désirée Lamoral	2001	JOLIS	10.1177/096100060103300403	library science;digital library;economics;computer science;operations management;management;audit;operations research;world wide web	HCI	-73.54735933535692	-23.936688379596664	37463

In a factorial design with regulatory orientation and message frame as independent variables, participants (N = 106) conducted an information search on a web program. Participants selected online information that was congruent with their activated motivational orientation. Compatibility effects resulted in promotion orientation/gain frame and prevention orientation/loss frame participants reporting more favorable attitudes than promotion orientation/loss frame and prevention orientation/gain frame participants irrespective of exposure to messages incongruent with the activated motivational orientation. A similar pattern of results occurred with message recall. For behavioral intention, significant differences occurred for only the promotion orientation condition where gain-framed messages elicited greater behavioral intentions than the loss-framed message.	framing (social sciences)	Traci Hong	2014	Communication Research	10.1177/0093650212439710	psychology;multimedia;regulatory focus theory;advertising;social psychology	HCI	-87.27111507458244	-19.657489145887965	37556

This can be taken as further evidence for the dissimilarity of the two corporation genres mentioned before. The dominance value of sustainability reports is on average greater than that of all news categories. Furthermore, we could show that the reports (in each case with respect to the authoring company) all share a specific tendency in their emotion value which is even relatively constant over time. This is especially true when examining the two subcorpora of annual and sustainability reports separately. In this case, the proportion of explained variance with consideration of the corporation which authored a report reaches values of about 70% (for arousal in annual reports, data are available in Büchel (2016)).

The popularity of digital games among adolescents has raised public and scientific concern about players drifting into excessive or pathological gaming patterns. Among the neglected issues in this area of research is the question of whether excessive gaming reflects a transient phenomenon during adolescence or a temporally stable pathological behavior that requires external intervention. In a correlational panel study with two points of measurement, we investigated the temporal stability of excessive gaming in German adolescents (N = 488; aged 12–17 years at Time 1) over a time lag of 1 year. Among the video game players in our sample, 2.8% were classified as excessive gamers at both points of measurement. The correlation of excessive gaming between T1 and T2 was found to be relatively moderate (r = .54).

In the United States some 90 percent of large private sector and 40 percent of public sector enterprises are reported to have at least one initiative in place to assist in the sharing of information. In contrast, the realities of not sharing information are great with estimates of up to $12 billion wasted each year as employees duplicate one another’s work. Information sharing is often facilitated by an IT-based organizational memory system, and this paper examines one such system at a large U.S.-based IT consulting firm. Our study examines what impacts information supply into the system. Using a wide-scale survey deployed to over 1,200 professionals with over a 30 percent response rate, we use structural equation modeling to show that information supply by an individual is a result of weighing up the personal costs and benefits of such supply. While the costs of information supply have been covered in depth in the literature, the benefits side of the equation has received little attention. This paper addresses that gap, and shows that the ability to influence is a critical component of the benefits the information supplier expects to receive to offset the costs of supplying information. We conclude by noting how this research may impact managers, suppliers and users of information sharing systems, and present ideas for future research.	structural equation modeling	David R.

A content analysis of MySpace blogs was conducted to investigate trends in purpose, format, and style and to compare these across sex and age categories. Most blogs were written in a positive tone, and the main motivations for blogging appeared to be writing a diary and as an emotional outlet. Findings also indicate that while there were no significant sex differences, blog purpose and style differed across age groups; for example, bloggers over 50 were more likely to use the blog as an emotional outlet with a negative tone. Bloggers between 18 and 29 predominantly used a semiformal language style, whereas bloggers over 30 were equally as likely to use a semiformal or formal style. Results suggest that MySpace blogs are not dissimilar from other forms of blogging because they provide an important outlet for emotion and self-expression.	blog;categories;motivation;sex characteristics	Chris Fullwood;Natasha Sheehan;Wendy Nicholls	2009	Cyberpsychology & behavior : the impact of the Internet, multimedia and virtual reality on behavior and society	10.1089/cpb.2009.0138	psychology;medicine;computer science;multimedia;internet privacy	HCI	-84.50833316358167	-19.483566061277067	37708

Recently, they have also become powerful players in influencing decisions about inter-organizational systems (IOS). The influences of these multiple levels of governments on IOS are of an enormous scale and impact on businesses and national economies. Understanding them is a prerequisite for informed actions. From a theoretical point of view we contribute with the MLxMC framework, a conceptual framework, which combines a processual, multi-level approach with the motors of change. We use the MLxMC framework to explicitly highlight the influences of multiple levels of governments on IOS developments that take place in the highly regulated environment of international trade. We demonstrate how the framework can be applied to analyze such developments, extending the existing IOS research with models that explicitly acknowledge the role of government. The framework makes use of multi-level analysis by taking the political and institutional aspects into account. As an analytical tool, the framework can support business practitioners as well as policy-makers in their strategic choices of which level to engage at and with whom to collaborate in order to influence the debate.

In this paper, we show that when solving tasks with small duration (under five minutes), also known as microtasks, individuals decision making will be strongly biased by costs of searching (and evaluating) options rather than financial or non-financial incentives. Indeed, we are able to show that we can influence individuals decisions, when solving problems, by rearranging elements visually to modify an individual search sequence, be it by designing the virtual work environment or manipulating which options are first shown in non-controlled environments, such as the Amazon Mechanical Turk labor market. We performed almost 50 experiments in online networks where individuals were invited to work on tasks with varying degrees of difficulty within three settings: mathematical games with objective truth (Sudoku and SAT instances); surveys with subjective evaluation (public policy polling); and labor markets (Amazon Mechanical Turk).	online algorithm;problem solving;social network	Daniel Scain Farenzena;Luís C.

9f1f3054797dbe95464d6d4452b4e5f8efdd4b13	learning about ambiguous technologies: conceptualization and research agenda		Information Technologies (IT) have gradually transformed into complex digital artefacts with blurred and constantly changing functional boundaries. While this shift offers promising venues that unfold in front of our eyes every day, it also challenges the deeply entrenched knowledge structures on which ordinary users rely to learn about unfamiliar technologies. We propose to take a step back in order to theorize the ambiguous nature of modern IT and to speculate on how users learn to use them. This paper revisits a wide array of management (BYOD, Gamification) and IS design trends (generativity, everyday computing, incompleteness) through the lens of the categorization framework. Our review of the literature on ambiguous products suggests that users exposed to ambiguous technologies may experience a categorization difficulty that disrupts the process of learning how to use them. This difficulty stems from a user’s belief that there are multiple or inconsistent interpretations of why and how to use an IT, as well as a perception that a given IT has some attributes in common with one or several seemingly unrelated ITs. We build on this theorization to propose a research agenda and discuss the expected practical implications of this path of research.	bring your own device;categorization;conceptualization (information science);european conference on information systems;gamification;iacono's working set structure;visual artifact	Jean-Charles Pillet;Federico Pigni;Claudio Vitari	2017			epistemology;conceptualization;categorization;knowledge management;psychology	HCI	-76.9077681479849	-11.578822662035845	37749

Information and communication technology (ICT) can facilitate direct democracy. Therefore ICT should be used to realize direct democracy. But before embarking on an ICT-enabled, direct-democracy implementation path, we should determine whether we are justified in accepting the premise that direct democracy improves government.

"""" Regardless of whether governing qualifies as """" formal rule by the people """" or inclusive, effective, and efficient, it is no benefit if the government is tyrannical. Watson and Mundy (p. 27) insist efficient government is a fundamental principle of democracy that neutralizes demagogues and populists. We can all applaud transaction cost reductions , but there is no reason to believe saving money will reduce a demagogue's appeal. Becker (p. 29) supposes there may come a time when too much (participatory) democracy is reached, though this has never happened. How then did the majority in a participatory democracy elect Hitler? Snellen (p. 45) dismisses representative government as """" second best, at best. """" This is followed by the assertion that """" people prefer direct democratic arrangement """" and the accusation that the """" general """" interests are not served by representation because """" partisan """" interests prevail. In direct democracy, the majority rules. Are """" general """" interests defined as """" anything """" a majority decides? What prevents the majority from depriving the minority of its natural rights? Perhaps an increase in partici-patory democracy can be consistent with the rule of law— protecting minority rights and avoiding tyranny—but the absence of provisions to ensure these essential protections should prevent us from embracing the vehicle of our own destruction. Finally, I must question Grön-lund's quote of Castell: """" [T]he medium has become so comprehensive , so diversified, so malleable that it absorbs in the same multimedia the whole of human experience, past, present, and future. """" Without any indication of hyperbole, this is given as a reason political actors must play by the rules of the medium.

ccaf9a3c853e9c937caa284fd3f0461565e55090	perceptions of e-learning in organizations: an empirical study on the effects of gender age, duration of employment, and managerial level	empirical study	The e-learning industry is predicted by Gartner Group to grow to $33.4 billion by 2005 indicating a phenomenal expansion of market size almost 16 times its current state. The research results reported here are based on a major study involving over 370 e-learners within a large telecommunications company in Australia. Analysis indicates that staff do not prefer e-learning over its traditional face-to-face counterpart and that this is primarily driven by the perception that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. This research also explores the effect of demographic characteristics on an individual’s preference for e-learning and finds that each of gender, age, time in the workplace and managerial status has an effect on the way it is perceived. The paper concludes by suggesting that the introduction of e-learning into the corporate environment maybe more difficult than short-term cost savings might suggest. It also suggests that management will need to carefully consider the different groups being offered e-learning and tailor the courses with individual characteristics in mind.		K.

33f4148a38758f0bc84416f1ccb24637006b26f2	a practice and value proposal for doctoral dissertation data curation		The preparation and publication of dissertations can be viewed as a subsystem of scholarly communication, and the treatment of data that support doctoral research can be mapped in a very controlled manner to the data curation lifecycle. Dissertation datasets represent “low-hanging fruit” for universities who are developing institutional data collections. The current workflow for processing electronic theses and dissertations (ETD) at a typical American university is presented, and a new practice is proposed that includes datasets in the process of formulating, awarding, and disseminating dissertations in a way that enables them to be linked and curated together. The value proposition and new roles for the university and its student-authors, faculty, graduate programs and librarians are explored. 1 This paper is based on the paper given by the authors at the 6th International Digital Curation Conference, December 2010; received December 2010, published July 2011.

fa067323441b7be4e577b974ef27892d256a0437	acm-w embraces community college participation		The mission of ACm’s Women in CompuTing (ACM-W) states that it “supports, celebrates, and advocates internationally for the full engagement of women in all aspects of the computing field, providing a wide range of programs and services to ACM members and working in the larger community to advance the contributions of technical women” [3]. In July of 2012, Dr. Valerie Barr, Professor in the Computer Science Department and Director of Interdisciplinary Programs at Union College in Schenectady, New York, took over as chair of ACM-W. As part of her vision as chair, Dr. Barr reorganized committees with varying charges to help fulfill the mission of ACMW such as regional conferences, chapters, awards, communication, scholarships, and last but not least community colleges. Dr. Elizabeth Hawthorne, Senior Professor of Computer Science at Union County College in Cranford, New Jersey, and Chair of the ACM Committee for Computing Education in Community Colleges [1] was selected to serve on the ACM-W Council [2] as the community college representative. The governing structure of ACM-W also includes a strategic advisory board with representatives from the National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT) [11] and the Anita Borg Institute (ABI) [6]. Every year since 1994, ABI has conducted the national Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing Conference, designed to bring the research and career interests of women in computing to the forefront. Based upon ideas from these Grace Hopper Celebrations and with seed money from the National Science Foundation, ACM-W created regional conferences with the goal of eliminating “the isolation of women in computing by covering a map of the United States with Small Regional Celebrations, so that no young woman is ‘left out’ of opportunities for support and encouragement” [4]. These small regional conferences were the brainchild of Professor Gloria Townsend at DePauw University, and currently are being coordinated by Professor Jodi Tims at Baldwin Wallace University. On 29–30 March of 2013, the first ever community college regional conference of Women in Computing was held in Berea, Kentucky, at the unique and very charming Historic Boone Tavern, a hotel and restaurant of Berea College [7] staffed mainly by their students. The successful Kentucky Community College Women in Computing Celebration (KYCC-WiC) [10] was organized by two talented and dedicated women from Bluegrass Community and Technical College: Cindy Tucker and Melanie Williamson, both Associate Professors of Computer & Information Technologies. Most of the eleven faculty members in their department attended KYCC-WiC, demonstrating collegial and diverse support for the conference. Cindy and Melanie worked tirelessly for months to locate a suitable venue, raise corporate sponsorship, and plan an engaging conference program to provide both students and faculty with an insightful and inspirational experience. Besides ACM-W, corporate sponsorship included funding from Microsoft, DMD Data Systems, Raytheon, and Pearson Publishing.

CMV may lead to erroneous conclusions about relationships between variables by inflating or deflating findings. We analyzed recent survey research in IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, Journal of Operations Management, and Production and Operations Management to assess if and how scholars address CMV. We found that two-thirds of the relevant articles published between 2001 and 2009 did not formally address CMV, and many that did address CMV relied on relatively weak remedies. These findings have troubling implications for efforts to build knowledge within information technology, operations and supply chain management research. In an effort to strengthen future research designs, we provide recommendations to help scholars to better address CMV. Given the potentially severe effects of CMV, authors should apply the recommended CMV remedies within their survey-based studies, and reviewers should hold authors accountable when they fail to do so.	common criteria;serialization	Christopher W.

This paper argues a central factor in how a technology favors a societal concern stems from its institutional origin. A case study of the cookies technology, which allows web sites to maintain surveillance on their visitors, shows the differing influences of universities, firms, and consortia. Each of these institutions acted according to their own norms and processes and differentially shaped the cookies technology. The result suggests societal institutions act in a systematic and predictable fashion in shaping how communication technologies affect fundamental societal concerns.	http cookie;noise shaping;privacy	Rajiv C.

In the Dutch Wikipedia, an integrated and coherent data structure is created, while at the same time users succeed in distributing roles by selfselection. Some users focus on an area of expertise, while others edit over the whole encyclopedic range.

cfa13a3c4393e7b37095071cae8677de00aaa266	future access to essential services in a growing smart city: the case of surrey, british columbia		Abstract The concept of accessibility – the ease with which people can reach places or opportunities –lies at the heart of what makes cities livable, workable and sustainable. As urban populations shift over time, predicting the changes to accessibility demand for certain services becomes crucial for responsible and ‘smart’ urban planning and infrastructure investment. In this study, we investigate how projected population change could affect accessibility to essential services in the City of Surrey, one of the fastest growing cities in Canada. Our objectives are two-fold: first, to quantify the additional pressure that Surreyu0027s growing population will have on existing facilities; second, to investigate how changes in the spatial distribution of different age and income groups will impact accessibility equity across the city. We evaluated accessibility levels to healthcare facilities and schools across Surreyu0027s multimodal transport network using origin-destination matrices, and combined this information with high-resolution longitudinal census data. Paying close attention to two vulnerable population groups – children and youth (0–19 years of age) and seniors (65+ years of age) – we analyzed shifts in accessibility demand from 2016 to 2022. The results show that population growth both within and outside the catchments of existing facilities will have varying implications for future accessibility demand in different areas of the city. By 2022, the cityu0027s hospitals and walk-in clinics will be accessible to ~9000 and ~124,000 more people (respectively) within a predefined threshold of 30 min by public transport. Schools will also face increased demand, as ~8000 additional children/youth in 2022 will move to areas with access to at least half of the cityu0027s schools. Conversely, over 27,000 more people – almost half of them seniors – will not be able to access a hospital in under 30 min by 2022. Since low-income and senior residents moving into poorly connected areas tend to be more reliant on public transport, accessibility equity may decline in some rural communities. Our study highlights how open-source data and code can be leveraged to conduct in-depth analysis of accessibility demand across a city, which is key for ensuring inclusive and ‘smart’ urban investment strategies.

While many Americans view surveillance as a necessity in the name of national security, the government is not the only organization conducting surveillance. As technological capacity increases, an increasing number of employers are implementing technologies that allow them to maintain vigilance over the actions of their employees in the workplace. Despite many attempts to implement surveillance technologies, there is little evidence that companies are any safer now than they were ten years ago. This paper demonstrates how System Dynamics modeling can be utilized to help model the insider threat as a system. It provides analysis of the non-linear affect of decision making, assessing the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th order impacts of decisions, and demonstrates the important impact of delays in the system. A mathematical model is presented and simulations are conducted to determine the likely affect of company decisions and individual agent behavior.

The car is a medium of social communication and a special object of veneration in American, indeed North American, culture. It possesses a sacred or magical power to shape everyday life. Drawing on 19th century concepts of fetishism in the anthropological literature, the political economy of Marx, and Freudian psychoanalysis, a basic framework is set out in which to examine automobile culture. The study of the car as fetish provokes discussion of three central issues: autonomous technology, the constitution of human parts and machine parts, and the relationship between technology and gender. The thesis argues that we invest the automobile with power and significance in social and cultural rituals and it appears to take on the character of an independent, autonomous force. A closer examination reveals that human beings are engaged in a struggle to control the more perverse or pathological elements of car culture.	anthropological literature;autonomous robot;simple network management protocol;toys	Jon W.

The increased interest elevated the adoption of established theories for user acceptance, risk avoidance and motivational influencing factors. We propose a combination of elements from existing concepts, extended by newly identified factors, to postulate a novel theoretical model. Our analysis of a survey with 349 respondents reveals new constructs based on users’ perception of risks and features. We found that risks and features are significantly interrelated and both influence perceived usefulness, the technology acceptance model’s most important construct. Usefulness is diminished by perceived risks while it is increased by crowdsourcing features. Additionally, external motivation yields important influence factors. The revealed interrelations are discussed and should be accounted for in future research and implementations.	crowdsourcing	Till Blesik;Markus Bick	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-47650-6_14	crowdsourcing software development;data science;internet privacy;world wide web	ML	-88.31160249493597	-10.170029155987265	38198

This first paper of the study demonstrates the emergence, causes and traces of the AES phenomenon in the journal literature of the natural sciences already in the mature Little Science age, and the continuous existence of the phenomenon ever since. The perception and cognition of the effect is shown on the basis of the relevant findings of the present author's previous, manual fact-finding reference investigations based on autopsy, processing around 27,600 journal communications and reference stocks containing more than 322,000 citations.

Corresponding author: Ivan Png, NUS Business School, National University of Singapore, 15 Kent Ridge Drive, Singapore 119245, Singapore. We thank Hal Varian for pointing us to the federal Do Not Call registry, and Junhong Chu for valuable comments. Despite annual U.S. expenditures on public relations exceeding $19.42 billion, businesses lack practical guidance about the effectiveness of publicity on sales. Here, we assembled a rich and novel dataset of newspaper reports and consumer sign-ups with the U.S. “do not call” (DNC) registry to gauge the impact of news reports on consumer behavior. We found robust evidence that news reports did increase DNC registration. Specifically, a one percent increase in the number of news reports would raise DNC registrations by 0.02 percent. This estimate provides an upper bound on the sales-response function for media publicity. We also found that the politics of newspapers matters. Only reports in neutral newspapers (unaffiliated with either Democratic or Republican party) affected DNC registrations. Reports in Democratic and Republican newspapers had no effect.	compiler;direct numerical control;elasticity (cloud computing);frequency response;image registration;portable network graphics;report;streaming media	Khim-Yong Goh;Kai Lung Hui;Ivan P.

By drawing on two case studies that exhibit project escalation situation, decision-makers in both cases were interviewed and important documents reviewed, the paper has identified five types of decision dilemmas and their associated characteristics: justification, sunk cost, ambiguity, opportunity cost and completion. The decision dilemmas identified in this study and the recommendations for countering these dilemmas aim to help project managers improve the process of decision-making during project development. Furthermore, it is also important for organizations to be aware of the role played by decision dilemmas within the escalation phenomenon as such understanding could help organizations extricate themselves from future escalation predicaments.	privilege escalation;software development	Gary S.

e1229a9cd1908f5be4b72e5549355b1afa3c001f	exploring smartphone social networking services for mobile tourism		Through advanced mobile technologies, multi-functionalities offered by smartphones are emerging for people to use during travel. Under this circumstance, smartphone users can promptly receive information and accordingly adjust travel plans. Such scenario can be extended to social networking services (SNS) for accessing and sharing information on-the-go. However, there is little research in such mobile SNS context. This study aims to investigate the mobile usersu0027 willingness to specifically trust travel advice obtained from smartphone SNS, by conducting a quantitative survey to explore factors influencing usersu0027 trust on travel advice acquired from smartphone SNS (TTAASS). Our findings show that both perceived value of smartphone SNS (PVSS) and enjoyment of SNS activity (ESA) significantly influence TTAASS, mobile usersu0027 smartphone experience significantly affects ESA and PVSS, ESA significantly affects PVSS and facilitating conditions significantly affect ESA.

LBA is a new form of marketing communication that uses location-tracking technology in mobile networks to target consumers with location-specific advertising on their cell phones. It provides more targeted communication and interaction between the marketer and its potential customers. This paper reviews different aspects of LBA advertising and investigates the drivers of consumer acceptance toward it. Achieving this, a research framework is developed to explore the factors influencing consumer intention for using LBA in Iran. Individuals’ responses to questions about intention to accept/ use of LBA advertising were collected and analyzed with various factors modified from UTAUT with main constructs of utility expectancy, trust, effort expectancy, and control. While the model confirms the classical role of utility expectancy and effort expectancy as the key factors in technology acceptance, the results also show that users’ behavioral intentions are influenced by trust and their control on ads flow.	location-based service;mobile phone;online advertising	Kiyana Zolfaghar;Farid Khoshalhan;Mohammad Rabiei	2010	IJEA	10.4018/jea.2010040103	public relations;computer science;marketing;advertising;empirical research	HCI	-88.7126523598539	-9.972716696011448	38330

53fb4caa39374f26bb37b6481166d22b249bec9c	virtual team performances in crowdsourcing contests	virtual teams;social network analysis;crowdsourcing	Recent advances in information technology bring significant changes to the nature of work by allowing companies to tap “wisdom of the crowd” beyond their own workforce. In particular, organizations increasingly seek solutions to their business problems using online crowdsourcing contests that are open to the public. In these contests, self&organized vi rtual teams compete for monetary reward. Motivated by this new phenomenon, this research investigates how the social network structure of a virtual team impacts its performance in the context of online crowdsourcing contests. Specifically, we empirically assess the impact of the alignment of member centrality within the virtual team with their skill levels on team performances. Our analysis suggests that that member centrality&skill alignment has a negative impact on team performances. Our findings have strategic implications to the design of virtual work teams.	crowdsourcing;performance	Indika Dissanayake;Jie Jennifer Zhang;Bin Gu	2014			public relations;social network analysis;social science;simulation;computer science;knowledge management;team composition;management;crowdsourcing	Web+IR	-85.0139154956735	0.7894143476497146	38386

With the fast growth of the Chinese e-commerce industry, it is thus indispensable to design effective online review systems for e-commerce websites in the Chinese context, by taking into account cultural factors. In this paper, we conduct two empirical studies on online reviews. Firstly, we study how culture differences across countries (i.e., China and the USA) impact the way in which consumers provide online reviews. Secondly, we investigate the impact of online reviews on product sales in the Chinese context, and show that directly copying the ideas of successful online review systems in the USA will deteriorate the effectiveness of the systems in China. Finally, we propose several suggestions for the development of effective online review systems in the Chinese context based on the results of our two empirical studies and the findings in previous studies. 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.	dbpedia;e-commerce;econometric model;linear model;memory segmentation;online book;panel data;power distance;prospective search;text mining;theory	Hui Fang;Jie Zhang;Yang Bao;Qinghua Zhu	2013	Electronic Commerce Research and Applications	10.1016/j.elerap.2013.03.001	e-commerce;computer science;marketing;multimedia;advertising;world wide web;online participation	SE	-87.99921366156671	-12.557729364132644	38541

Identification of top issues is important since there is a limited understanding of security in outsourcing relationships. Such an analysis will help decision makers in appropriate strategic planning for secure outsourcing. Our analysis is conducted through a two-phase approach. First, a Delphi study is undertaken to identify the top issues. Second, an intensive study of phase one results is undertaken to better understand the reasons for the different perceptions.	outsourcing	Gurpreet Dhillon;Romilla Chowdhuri;Filipe de Sá-Soares	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-39218-4_30	management science;strategic planning;outsourcing;business;knowledge process outsourcing;delphi method;knowledge management	HCI	-81.4256855382741	2.0966520741701764	38572

Design/methodology/approach – Survey data from 241 managers (in charge of KM practices in their companies) in large Taiwanese firms were collected and used to test the research model using the structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. Findings – The results reveal that the attributes for individual-organizational-technological contexts have different impacts on three stages of KM evolution. In particular, knowledge self-efficacy, top management support, and KM system quality have positive effects on all three KM evolution stages. Research limitations/implications – Future research should include structured interviews and case studies of managers dealing with ongoing or recently completed KM planning projects to help understand the practical usefulness of the research model. Practical implications – Creating an organizational climate characterized by top management support and knowledge-sharing culture is likely to assist both management and employees in socializing and interacting with one another, thus driving KM effectiveness. Managers should strive to enable employees to propose ideas for new opportunities and foster a positive social interaction culture for implementing KM initiatives. Originality/value – Theoretically, this study aims to provide a research model that is capable of understanding the antecedents of the stage-based KM evolution. From a managerial perspective, the findings of this study provide valuable guidelines to policy-makers and practitioners in implementing KM and accelerating KM evolution.	evolution;interaction;knowledge management;openness;participatory culture;socialization;structural equation modeling	Hsiu-Fen Lin	2010	J.

It presents a broad, sweeping overview of the issues at hand for the modern laborer in the increasingly automated economy. From manufacturing to the service sector, from elder care to intelligent tutoring, myriad applications of artificial intelligence are addressed — enough that, if one accepts the author's claims about the impacts of increasing automation, there is no conceivable alternate economic sector in which those job losses can be offset. This multiple-industry focus distinguishes his book from those focused specifically on manufacturing or commercial robotics, and aligns it more closely with contemporary works like Brynjolfsson and McAffee’s Second Machine Age, though the author is ultimately less optimistic about the future. Also key to this work’s approach, the author fuses the technical, including approachable descriptions of technologies like artificial neural networks and genetic programming, with economic and political information and critique. The book uses descriptions of advancing AI technology to set up its punchline: the economy must be restructured to avoid total collapse. To this end, the author provides a number of insightful and productive re-framings of salient economic issues. Offshoring becomes “virtual immigration,” since remote workers profit from the economy and the infrastructure of a nation without directly contributing to its economy. Similarly, the author asks if decades of public investment in information technology (via DARPA, NSF, and other organizations) should give citizens a claim on the ownership of society’s “accumulated technological capital” that is otherwise at risk of being captured by a small, elite minority. The economy, according to the author, can be likewise reinterpreted as a resource in which all citizens have a stake, and therefore can be used to rationalize a guaranteed minimum income. Overall, the book is well-constructed, aimed at a popular audience that knows little about the underlying automation technologies or the social and economic realities of competing with automation. For a technologist, the coverage of the “robots” themselves is not particularly novel or insightful beyond what a consistent reader of Wired, Technology Review, and other technology-focused publications would already be familiar with. And for someone who attends to debates in contemporary economics or public policy, much of the economic and policy information is unlikely to be groundbreaking. But while little of Ford’s book is on the cutting edge of any one sub-field, Rise of the Robots is a competent, approachable, and a well-written synthesis of information across many areas, and provides a valuable, coherent picture of automation’s socio-economic interact ions.	applications of artificial intelligence;artificial neural network;cardiovascular technologist;coherence (physics);genetic programming;ibm notes;rise of the robots;robot;robotics;technological determinism	Erik L.

1d45f60d2333ec74c67fefdbbf3c3cf2e55f866e	influences of e-retailer sponsored virtual community on consumer loyalty: an exploration of underlying mechanisms		An e-retailer sponsored virtual community (ESVC), as the backyard of an e-commerce website, provides consumers with an online platform to play with each other. Different from transactional e-commerce platform, ESVC assembles consumers together to fulfil their social needs. In recent years, with the popular of Web 2.0 information and communication technologies (ICTs), e-retailers also start to integrate social media within ESVC. This greatly increases consumers’ online community participation, as social media facilitate information sharing and interactions among community members with a social flavour. Moreover, social media provide a variety of IT artefacts to visualize the interactions between consumers and e-retailer, which reshapes the relationship between e-retailer and customer as a triad model. However, in this new context, the influences of ESVC characteristics and IT artefacts on eretailer-customer relationship were not well investigated. Some researchers have made effort to open the “black box” between ESVC with social media investment and customer loyalty, but still lack theoretical foundations. This research explores the underlying mechanisms from a new perspective, and proposes a theoretical framework based on reciprocal theory.	black box;e-commerce;interaction;online community;online shopping;social media;virtual community;web 2.0	Qingqing Bi;Lele Kang	2013			information sharing;marketing;knowledge management;loyalty business model;computer science;information and communications technology;social media;transactional leadership;virtual community;loyalty;online community	AI	-86.20838893611692	-10.254786670917007	38759

Despite widespread agreement that """"accountability"""" is important in online life, the term has no standard definition. We make three contributions to the study of accountability: (1) We flesh out with realistic examples our claim that a purely preventive approach to security is inadequate; (2) We present, compare, and contrast some existing formal frameworks for accountability; (3) We explore the question of whether """"deterrence"""" may be a better general term in this context than """"accountability."""""""	authorization;confidentiality;information security;privacy;standard-definition television	Joan Feigenbaum;James A.

Since scientists are potential users of huge computational support, their communities provide relevant cases for domain characterization and software design. This paper investigates the possibilities of using ANT to characterize a real instance of those social networks. The active role of nonhuman actors allows us to trace the relations based on material clues left behind by the actors, and also to bring forth features to be explored by the social software. The results of a structural study offer a graphical representation that allows quantitative and qualitative analysis of the social network, while the temporal evolution case study suggests that cyclic associations are more likely to persist. These outcomes may inform a better design of Web 2.0 systems for those communities.	algorithm;computation;digital artifact;network theory;social media;social network;software design;web 2.0	Alysson Bolognesi Prado;Maria Cecília Calani Baranauskas	2013	Social Network Analysis and Mining	10.1007/s13278-013-0139-3	computer science;artificial intelligence;data mining;management science;social network	AI	-77.8307776414361	-17.09008116730878	38959

It is argued that BI’s impact on analyses and decision-making depends on the development of less complex applications. Research conducted for this paper finds that BI lacks a common definition and standard, that BI tools are too complex for the common user, and that a shortage of analytical literacy relevant to BI among business professionals is a barrier to BI adoption. The paper suggests that until BI analysis tools become more “human-centric, design-oriented” and less from a “technology-centric, engineering-oriented perspective”, BI will continue to fail in its objective to routinely improve business decision-making.

Having multiple versions of the truth further denigrates the propensity for an enterprise to harness the potential of both its human and asset capital (Harris, 2010). Maximizing the full potential of BI begins with first defining BI then designing applications that are equivalent to that definition. By incorporating a uniformed characterization of BI, “discussions...could be made more consistent and constructive [focusing]...on what matters – outcomes” (Herschel, 2010). This would help to concentrate application design efforts towards outcomes rather than building the infrastructure of data that falls short on engaging the “human-computer interaction that possesses intelligence: the human half” (Few, 2006, p. 1). Due to BI not having a standardized definition, various interpretations from academia to IT contributes to a general misunderstanding of not only what BI is but also what it is supposed to be when it is simply about “using data and data analysis to understand and manage your business” (Davenport, 2010). Variations of defining BI has led to designing complex applications that “are some of the most difficult to use relative to a variety of technologies” (Howson, 2010, p. 1). The complexities in these applications have made it even more challenging to find a qualified work force suited to use BI for analysis. As companies have discovered, having powerful, analytical BI applications means nothing without the kinds of people that have the “patience, aptitude, or interest to become proficient in BI software, learn how data is structured, or how to do statistical analyses” (Lucker, 2010). Training is a critical need for end-users to maximize the value of “sophisticated applications...that essentially the users are not taking advantage of [owing to a lack of training]” (Kelly, 2009). One of the biggest issues that hinder endusers from using BI to impact analyses and decision making is because “BI tools are considered hard to difficult to use, with largely unappealing interfaces” (Howson, 2010, p. 1). Research confirms that the design of BI applications is preventing a wider adoption of BI despite the critical role it can play in discovering new opportunities and supporting more of a scientific approach to decisions (Howson, 2010, p. 3).	harris affine region detector;human–computer interaction;kelly criterion;sion's minimax theorem;aptitude	Robert Sawyer	2011	IJBIR	10.4018/jbir.2011070104	operations research	HCI	-77.72327307590041	-0.20968368544087349	38975

The threat model is based on attack trees with several novel enhancements to promote model reuse and flexible metrics, implemented in a software tool, AttackDog. We assess the practicality of reusable threat models for local elections offices and analyze specific vulnerabilities in Marin County, using as our metric “attack team size” (ATS) – the number of individuals who are knowingly involved in election fraud.	attack tree;credit card fraud;programming tool;threat model	Eric Lazarus;David L.

The perceived benefits of communication technology form a ‘push’ force. Two ‘pull’ forces include the desire to solve a cognitive gap caused by the communication context, and the desire to bridge the performance gap in allocating resources to tasks. The empirical findings confirm that ‘technologypush’ and ‘communication-pull’ forces are positively associated with e-mail coordination performance, showing the coexistence of rational and social influences, while the association between task and communication contexts indicates that the development of perceived information-sharing norms is context-dependent. Accordingly, this study concludes that appropriate information-sharing norms enable actors to create an active communication context for using e-mail in cooperative work. 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we, during an inter-disciplinary collaboration between social computing and animal behaviour researchers, investigated whether a simple image-tagging application could improve the understanding of how people ascribe intentions and emotions to the behaviour of their domestic cats. A web-based application, Tag puss, was developed to present casual users with photographs drawn from a database of 1631 images of domestic cats and asked them to ascribe an emotion to the cat portrayed in the image. Over five thousand people actively participated in the study in the space of four weeks, generating over 50,000 tags. Results indicate Tag puss can be used to identify cat behaviours that lay-people find difficult to distinguish. This highlights further expert scientific exploration that focuses on educating cat owners to identify possible problems with their cat's welfare.	database;internet;schrödinger's cat;social computing;social media;web application	Derek Foster;Ben Kirman;Conor Linehan;Shaun W.

5e400dd19394ada8b816125f81b50fbc541da56e	meme creation and sharing processes: individuals shaping the masses		Individuals are able to effect massive online social change through the viral sharing of memes. Sharing is initially influenced by meme creators and secondarily by meme consumers, whose individual sharing decisions accumulate to determine total meme sharing. By investigating meme creation as a separate process from meme sharing, we hope to create an account of online sharing that includes features of both processes. The present work uses psychological methods, web log monitoring [Harley et al. 2006], statistical modeling, and agent modeling [North et al. 2006] to explore meme creation and sharing. Over the course of two studies, human participants were observed creating and sharing memes during a 70-day period, and these behaviors were statistically modeled. The resulting model of sharing was implemented as an agent simulation to investigate whether models of contagion [Dodds and Watts 2005; Christakis and Fowler 2012] could simulate the dynamics of our human sample.	blog;harley's humongous adventure;meme;noise shaping;simulation;statistical model;watts humphrey	Ian Miller;Gerald Cupchik	2014	CoRR		simulation;knowledge management;social psychology;world wide web	HCI	-83.71762511031851	-17.701322207740844	39137

One effect of this move to cloud computing is the breaking down of entry barriers to competition. Small and even startup firms no longer need significant capital (CapEx) to purchase racks of servers and their associated maintenance costs in order to start offering services online. Instead, they can instantly provision a server image online with Amazon Web Services, for example, or lease an off-the-shelf Web server from a company like RackSpace. Even better, if the offering catches fire on the Internet or commercial market, a robust cloud computing service can scale to demand instantaneously instead of risking the demand outstripping server capacity. Even large firms are quickly adopting cloud computing to take advantage of the decreased costs that result when dropping multimillion-dollar operating expense (OpEx) obligations that go handin-hand with managing server farms. Instead, they’re adopting public cloud computing services to achieve economies of scale in a shared infrastructure, thereby enabling them to cut costs while focusing on their core business. In other words, the economic value cloud computing brings is compelling and driving adoption forward at a rapid pace. While the CapEx and OpEx numbers are propelling cloud computing adoption from a business case perspective, the most significant barrier to full adoption across enterprise services is trust. We deliberately use the term “trust” instead of “security” because it isn’t yet clear that security is deficient or sufficient in the cloud computing offerings on the market today. Rather, the uncertainty associated with security and privacy of cloud computing services is contributing to a sense of unease when moving valuable corporate IP, sensitive corporate documents, and customer and personnel information to public cloud-based services. Until the industry can provide evidence of trustworthiness either through meaningful standards or a consistent historical record of protection and robustness of service, security and privacy concerns will continue to provide significant friction against cloud computing adoption.

During 2017, we were able to maintain an average of about five months from the date of submission to the date of the initial decision. The interval from the date of submission to the date of publication varies depending on how many times a manuscript must be revised and re-reviewed; the median time to publication for the articles that appeared in volume 121, issue 4 (October 2017), was between 10 and 11 months. In speaking with colleagues, I have been surprised to learn that some readers of the AJA are not familiar with the AJA e-Update, a monthly email newsletter with links to the journal’s online open access material and a list of the full contents of the latest issue. AJA’s open access content includes book reviews, museum exhibition reviews, and one or two articles from each issue; all of this can be accessed with a click or two via the monthly email. The eUpdate is available to everyone, both subscribers to the AJA and nonsubscribers. However, subscribers to the AJA should be aware that they must opt in to receive the e-Update; out of consideration to overburdened inboxes, the AJA does not send the monthly message to subscribers unless they request it. To receive the e-Update, go to www.ajaonline.org/e-update. A letter from Josephine Shaya, the new Museum Review Editor for the AJA, appears in the following pages. Jo will soon introduce a new section on AJA Online that will provide information about current and upcoming museum exhibitions related to topics within the scope of the AJA (defined by the AIA’s Governing Board as “the art and archaeology of ancient Europe and the Mediterranean world, including the Near East and Egypt, from prehistoric to Late Antique times”). The list will include exhibitions worldwide and give dates, locations, the availability of catalogues, and other pertinent information. Scholars often know about exhibitions planned or current in their own areas of specialization; we hope that many will be interested in shows about other areas of ancient European, Mediterranean, and Near East archaeology. My previous Editorial Assistant, Michael McGlin, returned to full-time work on his dissertation at SUNY Buffalo. I want to thank Mike for much hard work and dedication.

The question is perilous, because the term “market failure” is unfortunately used, and misused, to refer to different things (from market outcomes that are not Pareto efficient, correctly; to, incorrectly, any market outcome one happens not to like); but so is also (notoriously) the term “privacy.” 1 The question, however, is also important: it calls us to consider whether market forces can adequately “protect” information privacy—and, in turn, what should be the essence of such protection, and what level of protection may be considered adequate. Hence, the initial query can be rephrased as: Will market forces be able to maintain a desirable balance between privacy and disclosure, in a world where most of our personal and professional lives unfold trails of electronic data, and where powerful economic interests favor information availability over information protection? In principle, a balance between information access and information protection may be the shared long-term interest of both data subjects and data holders—more so than either extremes (unfettered access to individual data, or complete blockage of any flow of personal	failure;information access;information privacy;information security;pareto efficiency	Alessandro Acquisti	2012	JTHTL		market failure;actuarial science;public relations;business	ECom	-71.8823691149628	-11.357967014869304	39261

Questions referring to data protection, data security and intellectual property rights, which are even made more complex because of the transnational aspect of such research, have to be addressed in order to make data sharing legally compliant. Additionally, medical research brings along ethical requirements such as protecting the autonomy and the well-being of the patients. In all, a wide net of rules has to be considered, and in most cases this may hinder the flexibility needed for clinical researches. This paper aims to give an overview of these issues and an insight of the p-medicine's approach at navigating these requirements, which can serve as a guide to similar projects, especially within the EU.	autonomy;data protection directive;data security;database;decision support system;directive (programming);information privacy;requirement;whole earth 'lectronic link	Iheanyi Nwankwo;Stefanie Hanold;Nikolaus Forgó	2012	2012 IEEE 12th International Conference on Bioinformatics & Bioengineering (BIBE)	10.1109/BIBE.2012.6399764	computer science;knowledge management;information security;data mining;management science;data protection act 1998;intellectual property	DB	-70.33882108352677	-8.452554700456192	39277

This article describes Norfolk Southern Railway’s BI journey, which began in the early 1990s with departmental reporting, evolved into data warehousing and analytic applications, and has resulted in a company that today uses BI to support corporate strategy. We describe how BI at Norfolk Southern evolved over several decades, with the company developing strong BI foundations and an effective enterprise-wide BI capability. We also identify the practices that kept the BI journey “on track.” These practices can be used by other IT and business leaders as they plan and develop BI capabilities in their own organizations.	strategic management	Barbara Wixom;Hugh J.

I argue that our research, and the underlying rewards system that drives it, needs to respond to these concerns. We need to be more relevant to meet the increasing needs of our students, the organizations that hire them, and the larger society. To analyze the issues, I develop three different scenarios of where the IS field could be 10 years from now. The following visions of the future identify the implications of different levels of adaptation to relevance-related environmental pressures. Scenario 1: Minimal Adaptation. The IS field is shrinking, largely due to competition from newly established schools of information technology. The traditional paper-based journals continue to dominate. Their slow publication cycles, in contrast to the rapid rate of change in the IT industries, mean that most technical topics and many current managerial issues are excluded from the research that generates the greatest institutional rewards. However a market analysis indicates that we can still do relevant research in categories such as: 1) issues contrary to commercial interests; 2) unsolved problems; 3) issues economically unattractive to commercial researchers; 4) issues where 1 With apologies to James Martin for the similarity to the title of one [Martin, 1984] of his many books.

This is certainly the case for portals that increase patients’ access to physicians, as with secure electronic messaging. The authors suggest that the younger, more affluent users of the PatientSite portal in our study reflect the demographics of the physicians who care for them. Unfortunately, our study did not address this provocative question directly. However, the demographic profile of PatientSite users reflects the profile of consumers who use the Web for health information in national surveys.

However, despite its potential, NFC-based payment has not reached mass adoption on the customer nor on the merchant side. This paper constructs a preliminary framework for studying digital payment systems and analyzing strategies of current market actors, such as banks, mobile network operators, and merchants. These market actors are identified as incumbents or contenders, and they are currently jockeying for digital payment platform leadership. We analyze three different contactless payment systems implemented or planned by different actors in the European market. When synthesizing our observations, we note that all three multi-sided platforms (MSP) can provide fully functional and technically solid NFC payment systems. All three platforms seek to gain a foothold by subsidizing NFC payment instruments to their existing customer base. In addition, they extend their existing platform with other contactless services, thereby transforming existing cards (SIM or debit) from single-purpose to multi-functional cards. Our research extends existing payment literature from the MSP perspective to accommodate technological developments, where technology (NFC) and platform design impact market actor strategies and complementary products.	acquiring bank;contactless payment;contactless smart card;debit card;mnos;max;mobile phone;near field communication;trojan horse (computing);user experience	Erol Kazan;Jan Damsgaard	2013			computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;commerce;payment	ECom	-82.58824171659128	-8.794798172080831	39501

The more Information Communication Technologies and Assistive Technologies increase the potential to enable people with disabilities to take part in almost any area of life, the more eInclusion and eAccessibility become a common responsibility of the mainstream tourism industry. The European Commission appreciates this fact and therefore supports different activities to raise the awareness of the impact and the business opportunities that Accessible Tourism introduces. The forthcoming process of demographic ageing will lead to a growing number of tourists with needs for more accessibility and higher service quality also in tourism. Introduction and Economic Dimension The success and the competitiveness of tourism destinations depend on customer perception, an effective customer acquisition, satisfying customer support and successful customer retention [1]. The market of travelers with disabilities is lucrative, but frequently neglected by the tourism industry. Tourism and travel experiences are still highly restricted by physical accessibility barriers, such as: transportation constraints, inaccessible accommodation and tourism sites as well as information barriers such as a general lack of information, inadequate or incomplete information or poorly designed web sites. The tourism industry has on the one hand neglected to provide information about accessibility and on the other hand to adopt inclusive design principles. This is because of lack of enforcement of statutory building regulations, lack of knowledge and misperception about disabled and elderly customers’ actual requirements, and social segregation and stereotype challenges of catering for disabled and elderly customers [2, 3]. The accessibility requiring market is significant in terms of size as well as spending power. It has been estimated that over 750 million people worldwide and about 37 to 45 million people in Europe [4] have some type of disability. The OSSATE project has estimated the number of people with accessibility requirements 2 Franz Pühretmair, Dimitrios Buhalis in Europe to almost 130 million, when including the elderly as there is a strong and positive correlation between ageing and disability [4]. It has been estimated that 70% of them have the physical as well as the financial capabilities to travel. The economic dimension has been approved by different international studies [4, 5]. [5] has shown that in Germany 54.3% of people with disabilities travel. But 37% have already renounced a travel because adequate offers were missing and 48% of them would travel more frequently, if there were more accessible offers. To address the accessibility requiring market and to benefit from the multiplier effects generated by friends and relatives traveling with them tourism organizations and destinations should reassure accessibility in both their physical/built and on-line environments.	accessibility;assistive technology;customer support;experience;franz lisp;online and offline;requirement;stereotype (uml)	Franz Pühretmair	2006		10.1007/11788713_44	availability;simulation;internationalization and localization;computer science;accessibility;operating system;user interface;tourism;computer security;added value	HCI	-71.21147239934331	-21.259769139837623	39605

These strategies are: (a) universality of theory, (b) referentiality and reification of ‘images’, (c) internalisation of representations, (d) radical individualism and erasure of the social dimension of theory, (e) insistence upon knowledge, (f) constitution of the information scientist as an expert in image negotiation, and (g) instrumental reason, ruled by efficiency, standardisation, predictability, and determination of effects. The discourse is guided throughout by a yearning for natural‐scientific theory. The effect of the cognitive viewpoint's discursive strategy is to enable knowledge acquisition of information processes only when users' and generators' ‘images’ are constituted as objectively given natural‐scientific entities, and to disable knowledge o...	viewpoint	Bernd Frohmann	1992	Journal of Documentation	10.1108/eb026904	library science;social science;cognition;content analysis;epistemology;information science;sociology	NLP	-73.56714381414557	-20.3689876789335	39609

They visited libraries to cover the rest of the literature. In those days, journals were much more affordable. A survey of the American Chemical Societ y chapter in Philadelphi a found that most members subscribed to more journals than they read. It was the time of the reprint culture (Garfield, 1999). Authors exchanged reprints generously . It was not unusual to mail reprints regularl y to member s of one’s invisible college. The now ubiquitousXerox machinewasnot available, and photostats were expensive and cumbersome. Correspondenc e by snai l mail was the norm, as was the use of printed indexes and abstracting services. The pace of researc h and the publication proces was significantly slower. Once published, however , the time to deliver journals and reprints, including transatlanti c steamshi p delivery was remarkable. Rudi Schmi d described the speed of intercontinental and transcontinenta l mail transi t times from Europe to California from 1852 to 1941 (Schmid, 1984). The transi t and mail postal system is now considered archaic. Nevertheless , most print journals still use snai l mail for domesti c distribution augmente d by air-cargo services for international distribution. After World War II , the introduction of telephone, fax, and then e-mai l created a completely new situation. On-line acces to indexing and abstracting services was introduced in the1970s. Two decades later, full-text journal articles on-line began to appear and now are routinely provided. The integration of the journal literature with A&I services through linking services present s a completely transformed situation. Reader s are now instantl y accessing journal content s pages, abstracts , cited references with abstracts, and full text. It is possibl e to browse the current literature on-line and in real time go backwar d and then forward agai n into related documents . As full-text archives increase their chronological scope, it wil l be possibl e to search and peruse the literature without ever entering the library. Within 5 years, scientist s wil l be able to acces most of the last 10 years of the literature electronically. In adecade, this wil l extend to much of the journal literature of the 20th century, especiall y for the 1000 most-consulte d journals. Full conversion wil l depend upon the cost of scanning back runs of journals, following the JSTOR model . However, Dana Roth (Roth, 1999), rejecting the JSTOR model , has suggeste d wecreat efilesof themost-cited papers. Although the highest impact journals of science are currentl y available, electronicall y complet e archives are still a rarity. The 500 most-cited journals identified by ISI’s Journal Citation Reportst are listed on Highwire’s Web site. But there are still formidablebarriersunlessyour library hasan electronic site license for all these journals. An alternative interim step is to use e-mail to contact authors rapidly for acces to articles not yet directly available on the Web. Some articles may even be found on the author’s personal home page. It would greatly improve the situation if each institution assumed responsibility for creating digital libraries of the articles produced by their faculty, especiall y those who are retired or deceased . It would be equally helpful if university Web sites provided a standardize d means of acces to faculty email addresses. The creation of large digital libraries seems inevitable, especiall y if technology continues to reduce the cost of conversion from paper . Large-scal e conversions to PDF files are possibl e at a cost of about 50 cents to $1.00 per page. Project s like JSTOR are intended to take care of the archiving gap even as individual authors self-archive. Clearly, there is atacit desire to archive everything that has been published. However, a situation that is half-electronic and half-paper wil l inevitably lead to equall y half-baked retrospective coverage of the literature. Authors take the path of least resistance . Obtaining anything not archived on the Web is increasingl y costly. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. ●	archive;artificial intelligence;browsing;care-of address;digital library;email;fax;half-life 2: episode two;home page;information retrieval;john d. wiley;journal citation reports;library (computing);online and offline;php;path of least resistance;portable document format;postal;printing;prospective search;realms of the haunting;site license;world wide web	Eugene Garfield	2001	JASIST	10.1002/1532-2890(2000)52:1%3C18::AID-ASI1059%3E3.0.CO;2-5	push technology;digital library;telecommunications;computer science;artificial intelligence;information technology;world wide web;information system	Web+IR	-68.14974282149225	-20.213611451203025	39755

9e639a2ebcde715e314268c6f65874ac80bcb66f	understanding and mitigating uncertainty in online exchange relationships: a principal-agent perspective		Despite a decade since the inception of B2C e-commerce, the uncertainty of the online environment still makes many consumers reluctant to engage in online exchange relationships. Elena Karahanna was the accepting senior editor for this paper. D. Harrison McKnight and Jonathan D. Wareham served as reviewers. The associate editor and the third reviewer chose to remain anonymous. Even if uncertainty has been widely touted as the primary barrier to online transactions, the literature has viewed uncertainty as a “background” mediator with insufficient conceptualization and measurement. To better understand the nature of uncertainty and mitigate its potentially harmful effects on B2C e-commerce adoption (especially for important purchases), this study draws upon and extends the principalagent perspective to identify and propose a set of four antecedents of perceived uncertainty in online buyer–seller relationships—perceived information asymmetry, fears of seller opportunism, information privacy concerns, and information security concerns—which are drawn from the agency problems of adverse selection (hidden information) and moral hazard (hidden action). To mitigate uncertainty in online exchange relationships, this study builds upon the principal–agent perspective to propose a set of four uncertainty mitigating factors—trust, website informativeness, product diagnosticity, and social presence— that facilitate online exchange relationships by overcoming the agency problems of hidden information and hidden action through the logic of signals and incentives. The proposed structural model is empirically tested with longitudinal data from 521 consumers for two products (prescription drugs and books) that differ on their level of purchase involvement. The results support our model, delineating the process by which buyers engage in online exchange relationships by mitigating uncertainty. Interestingly, the proposed model is validated for two distinct targets, a specific website and a class of websites.

Yet, whilst there has been no shortage of definitions of the term over the years (not all of which are consistent), there is little consensus on the scope of Systems Engineering. This is particularly true in relation to other overlapping disciplines such as System Dynamics, Operations Research, Industrial Engineering, Project Management, Soft Systems Methodology, Specialist Engineering and Control Theory, which share many of the origins and techniques of Systems Engineering. This paper presents a landscape of disciplines and suggests that INCOSE should ‘brand’ Systems Engineering strategically, defining explicitly its position within this landscape including its points of parity (overlaps) and points of difference with other disciplines. Actively branding Systems Engineering will broaden its appeal and attract more interest from stakeholders outside the current Systems Engineering community. INCOSE’s ‘market share’ relative to its biggest systems competitor – Project Management – is falling, so even though INCOSE membership is rising, more needs to be done to promote the profession.	control theory;industrial engineering;lurker;operations research;principle of good enough;soft systems methodology;system dynamics;systems engineering;while	Michael Emes;Alan Smith;Douglas Cowper	2005	Systems Engineering	10.1002/sys.20028		SE	-76.12014237997478	0.6759572562270857	40041

This interest is motivated less by ownership per se, which at its base resides in feelings of possessiveness towards a target, and more by the way ownership appears to be associated with other key phenomena and processes that can make or break the success of CI or ICT4D interventions, and their capacity to last over time. The local sustainability of CI interventions, for instance, requires enduring, committed and effective action, which are best afforded when local people regard an initiative as their own (Pade et al., 2008). As indicated by several studies (e.g. Ballantyne, 2003; Weeks et al., 2002; Pade et al., 2008) ownership connects with, determines or stands at the basis of empowered action and control, committed local participation, and the drive to engage in capacity building; all of which can uplift a community's capacity to take agency of and engage effectively in the care and management of a CI initiative. What remains unclear, however, is why ownership is such a key link and how it can be measured in a systematic manner. In other words, how can a concept regarded as fuzzy and unclear (Khan and Sharma, 2001:13; Johnson and Wasty 1993: 2) be operationalized and used in systematic measurement?	community informatics;word lists by frequency	Carlos Rey-Moreno;Amalia G.

Carlotta's senior designer left after six months, and her group has not approved a single new candidate among the ten they've interviewed. Reason. Carlotta's team is small—with only half a dozen people in the office, it's very important that they all get along well together. The well-liked designer who had left had taken a leave of absence and would eventually be returning. Not wishing to establish a new relationship with someone expected to be a short-term colleague, Carlotta's team would rather work without a designer, and in fact were producing reasonable results without one. Carlotta would like the team to be more flexible, but the team would rather hire design support on contract per project. And that new per-son—he laughs too loudly. Questions Carlotta Could Have Asked: • Our designer will eventually return; are we willing to collaborate and cooperate with a new colleague , or should we hire by the hour per project? • We have a small office; what requirements do each of you have for the new person? • Should we discuss how we work together here before we start interviewing replacements for our designer?

The success of social media depends on users’ willingness to continue investing their time and efforts in the absence of economic rewards, making psychological attachment critical to online communities. While prior studies identify that members do develop psychological commitment to online communities, why and how the commitment arises remain underexplored. This study focuses on the relationship between network overlap, a common feature of online social networks, and affective commitment to an online community. Drawing on the commitment theory and social network boundary theory, we argue that the effect of online/offline network overlap is partially mediated by network boundary blurring. Meanwhile, contrary to industrial wisdom, the direct impact of network overlap on commitment is negative. Our empirical study supports our proposal. It indicates that it is critical to help users integrate online and offline social networks. Without success social network boundary blurring, high level of network overlap may backfire.	attachments;commitment ordering;embedded system;high-level programming language;interaction;knowledge spillover;online and offline;online community;relevance;social media;social network	Nan Zhang;Chong Wang	2016		10.5220/0005911203270332	empirical research;knowledge management;computer science;organizational network analysis;online participation;online and offline;social media;organizational commitment;online community;social network	HCI	-87.38048464417949	-16.542423397715112	40118

However, there are growing concerns that these services may systematically underserve some groups of users. In this paper, we present a framework for internally auditing such services for differences in user satisfaction across demographic groups, using search engines as a case study. We first explain the pitfalls of näıvely comparing the behavioral metrics that are commonly used to evaluate search engines. We then propose three methods for measuring latent differences in user satisfaction from observed differences in evaluation metrics. To develop these methods, we drew on ideas from the causal inference literature and the multilevel modeling literature. Our framework is broadly applicable to other online services, and provides general insight into interpreting their evaluation metrics.	causal filter;causal inference;e-services;evaluation function;multilevel model;social media;web search engine	Rishabh Mehrotra;Ashton Anderson;Fernando Diaz;Amit Sharma;Hanna M.

Four information culture types are proposed. In a Resultoriented culture, the goal of information management is to enable the organization to compete and succeed in its market or sector. In a Rule-following culture, information is managed to control internal operations, and to reinforce rules and policies. In a Relationship-based culture, information is managed to encourage communication, participation, and a sense of identity. In a Risk-taking culture, information is managed to encourage innovation, creativity, and the exploration of new ideas. We expect most organizations to display to varying degrees norms and behaviors from all four types, and that the information culture profile of an organization would be related to its effectiveness. The paper ends by looking at the practical and theoretical value of a systematic examination of information culture and its link to organizational effectiveness.	information culture	Chun Wei Choo	2013	Int J.

Using this method it is possible to explain such a break in terms of causal networks of factors. The thus created explanation is validated using evidential arguments based on expert opinions. Moreover, this explanation is used to predict the future course of the trend after the break. To do so, experts are asked to predict the development of the factors at the beginning of the explanation.	causal filter;time series	Susan W. van den Braak;Anne Sonnenschein;Sunil Choenni;Paul R.

We also examine the moderating effect of the virtual community origin. By analyzing 172 responses, we found that the sense of virtual community is affected by the virtual community characteristics such as (1) leaders’ enthusiasm, (2) perceived similarity, (3) off-line activities, and (4) playfulness. From the moderated regression analysis, we also found that the virtual community origin moderates the relationship between virtual community characteristics and sense of virtual community.	online and offline;virtual community	Joon Koh;Young-Gul Kim	2003	Int.

Nowadays, even more Internet users prefer to shop online than visiting a brick-and-mortal store. Thus, understanding who are the ones consuming and why they choose to use or avoid the Internet as a distribution channel, as well as predicting the e-consumer behavior is a vital aspect in marketing and a necessary requirement for both e-commerce managers and consumer theorists. The scope of this paper is to examine through a longitudinal survey the perceptions of university students' adopters and non-adopters of e-shopping in terms of demographic profile and perceived advantages and problems related to online purchases. Moreover, the reasons for using or avoiding online shopping as well as the types of preferred products and services are investigated. The research provides interesting insights on the e-consumer behavior to both academia and industry.	online shopping	Vaggelis Saprikis	2013	JECO	10.4018/jeco.2013010103	e-commerce;public relations;economics;computer science;marketing;electronic business;advertising;management;world wide web	HCI	-85.14139167850867	-11.11357253722993	40416

The workshop concerned aiding and understanding the human decisionmaker through the knowledge-based sciences and was held in Northern Virginia in 1985. The purpose of the workshop was to explore research issues in human decisionmaking in terms of how they might be addressed by several disciplinary areas concerned with various aspects of knowledge-based systems. The goal was to develop a research agenda that takes advantage of the commonality and differences in these areas so as to create research programs with substantially greater potential than possible if only a single discipline was involved. Such an agenda and potentially high payoff research in knowledge-based support to human information processing and judgment and choice are described.	information processing;knowledge-based systems	Andrew P.

Rather, they are the result of the vision and intuition of a small number of creative individuals, facilitated by the emergence of a new technology. In this paper we consider how the conditions that enable new products' emergence might be better anticipated, making innovations a little less reliant on individual vision and a little more informed by stakeholder need. This is particularly important where a new technology would have the potential for social impact, good or bad. Speculative design seeks to explore this landscape. We describe a case study using a variant called design fiction to explore how plausible new technologies might impact on dementia care.	care-of address;emergence;prototype;requirement;requirements engineering;simulation;speculative execution;traceability	Andy Darby;Emmanuel Tsekleves;Peter Sawyer	2018	2018 IEEE 26th International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE)	10.1109/RE.2018.00-20	management science;computer science;software;emerging technologies;design fiction;small number;stakeholder;intuition;government	SE	-76.84568071480473	-11.474584963629962	40529

Of late, contribution of IK to conservation of resources and solution science has been realised by academia and policy-makers, which is expanding the frontiers of knowledge use for innovation. Interface between science and indigenous knowledge system IKS is increasingly observed in the field of agriculture, simultaneously putting emphasis on knowledge transformation at institutional level. With this central argument, the paper discusses essentialities of IK as socio-cultural base of agricultural innovation. Indigenous knowledge's engagement with innovation reflects the nature of preservation of IK within the discourse of technology transfer. Findings of the study suggest that empowerment of agricultural extension units is essential for preservation of knowledge and to facilitate reproduction of appropriate knowledge.

As one of several authors critiqued by Koch for an ‘‘appropriation and transformation of Snow’s mapping to serve interests Snow himself would not have recognized as legitimate’’ (2004, 2), I offer a close reading of what I said and what Koch says I said.	koch snowflake;tom	Mark Monmonier	2005	Cartographica	10.3138/N2Q6-0582-0254-7157	psychology;artificial intelligence;cartography	NLP	-63.43001625855487	-20.61757063109858	40619
3bb5a4ec16ae64bae4204e5bcb4e617cde51864b	a study on the impact of values on the open source design decision-making process	selected works;bepress	The effect of the personal values such as trust or a desire for privacy of users and developers of open source software (OSS) on the development and use of the software developed by OSS projects is a topic of growing interest in the Information Systems (IS) field. This topic has been investigated in proprietary IS development, but a limiting factor in many of these studies is a lack of theoretical support for the values measured. Drawing on a large body of existing personal value research in social psychology, built on a foundation of over 30 years of research, this study will attempt to map personal values currently defined in IS research to the decision making behavior in OSS project communities. In particular, this research maps values, beliefs and norms defined by Stewart and Gosain (2006) and other descriptions of the ideologies driving OSS teams onto the value constructs measured by the Theory of Universals in Values (TUV). By using a common theoretical basis for values research, connections across seemingly unrelated values research may be found. Propositions for the first part of a two-staged exploratory study are proposed to test whether the TUV better defines the values, beliefs and norms found in the OSS community and provides a richer picture of what may, in part, drive decision-making behavior in the OSS community. The methodology for such a study is presented and possible contributions for researchers and practitioners are presented.	information system;map;open sound system;open design;open-source software	Bryan Hosack;Glen W.

The complexity of the Spanish political-administrative system makes such a study challenging, in view of the considerable degree of autonomy and competences of the regional administrative bodies and local agencies with respect to the central government, the former being more visible in the 17 regions of Spain. Nonetheless, the central government maintains a series of legal instruments that allow a certain common framework of action to be imposed, aside from what is put into effect through diverse programs aimed precisely to develop common tools for the regions and municipalities of Spain. After an introduction that provides some necessary background, this study describes the legislative framework in which Spain's electronic administrative system has developed. The data included in the study refer to investment in information and communication technologies (ICT) and the services offered by the different Administrations on the internet; internet access by citizens, homes, businesses, and employees, as well as the interactivity existing with administrations by means of the internet; the origins and rise of various political initiatives of the Central Government involving electronic administration; and finally, the situation of civil service personnel, as catalysts of the success of Information Society in the Public Administration	autonomy;interactivity;internet access	Antonio Muñoz-Cañavate;Pedro Hipola	2011	Government Information Quarterly	10.1016/j.giq.2010.05.008	public relations;information and communications technology;telecommunications;computer science;sociology;public administration;management;law;world wide web	HCI	-76.52552737323424	-8.684031825388848	40704

In this short report, we applied a quantitative analysis to identify landmark research contributions to GPS. This technique, reference publication year spectroscopy (RPYS), yielded key insights into early works that allowed for both the development and widespread use of GPS. In addition, using this approach to identify individual contributions of scientific excellence offers an opportunity to credit not only the research investigators, but also their corresponding affiliations and funding sources. Indeed, the findings from our analysis suggest that RPYS might serve as a powerful tool to substantiate the contribution of funding agencies, universities and institutes to research fields. We stress, however, that this method should not stand-alone for such purposes, but should be wedded with the knowledge and experience of subject matter experts.	global positioning system;sensor;subject matter expert turing test;subject-matter expert	Jordan A.

Under such a culture environment, the awareness of right of privacy raises late; therefore, it is of necessary raising people the concept of information privacy. To reach this purpose, this study adopts the theory of self-efficacy to examine factors that influence decisions related to information privacy. Further, a longitudinal model is explored whether information ethics education plays a role influencing students’ concept in protecting information privacy. A survey with senior-level undergraduate students is conducted to test the hypothesized model. The findings exhibit an important insight that through information ethics education, students demonstrate a significant change in their confidence of privacy self-efficacy; the increase of this concept noteworthy changes their behavior concerning information privacy protection.

cadebb8fbf1380d12a05d6b41476b43d2b61a9bc	conceptual model of virtual team leader actions for better technology appropriation	selected works;conceptual model;virtual team;bepress	With the availability of round-the-clock labor and inexpensive programming in India and other countries, software development projects increasingly take place in a virtual team setting. Adaptive structuration theory (AST) describes the process by which groups, such as virtual teams, use advanced information technologies. According to AST, people, technology and task structures interact, resulting in virtual team outcomes. Much virtual team research has focused on the people and other input factors. Technology as it relates to interaction processes remains under-examined in relation to virtual team leadership and should be explored. This paper applies AST and relevant current research on virtual teams to develop a framework and propositions regarding virtual team leader actions supporting technology appropriation.	interaction technique;software development	Dominic M.

Non-identification of individuals, products, or places is seen as a sufficient means of information protection. A prime example is the replacement of a name with a supposedly non-identifying initial. This has traditionally been effective in obfuscating the identity of military personnel, protected witnesses, minors, victims or suspects who need to be granted a level of protection through anonymity. We challenge the effectiveness of this form of censorship in light of current uses and ongoing developments in Social Networks showing that name-obfits cation mandated by court or military order can be systematically compromised through the unintentional actions of public social network commenters. We propose a qualitative method for recognition and characterization of UIL followed by a quantitative study that automatically detects UIL comments.	information leakage;information security;self-censorship;sensor;social media;social network;spectral leakage	Inbal Yahav;David G.

The theory draws on earlier work on leapfrogging and Sen's model of functionings and capabilities. The evidence draws partly on simple regression analysis. A key role is assigned to fixed-line telephony in reaching the conclusion that leapfrogging in mobile phones tends overall to be egalitarian in its impact on different developing countries. Mobiles however constitute very much the exception when it comes to technological relationships between rich and poor countries.	mobile phone	Jeffrey James	2012	Telematics and Informatics	10.1016/j.tele.2011.09.001	simulation;operations management;advertising	HCI	-81.8994862658546	-10.315919466491234	40995

Reasons for this trend include the search for partners with necessary technological and innovative knowledge of sourcing IT and the identification of cost-saving potentials. Unfortunately, IT-PPP-cooperations are particularly susceptible to failure due to the clash of different cultures. Divergent understandings, expectations, and pressure from the relevant stakeholders hinder a working partnership. Therefore, in this exploratory, qualitative single-case study from the German TollCollect IT megaproject, the authors draw on findings from boundary spanning literature to explain how establishing preconditions for boundary spanning and actively bridging the gap between the partners, moderated by external stakeholder support, affects the formation of mutual trust and success of an IT-PPP-megaproject.	bridging (networking);file spanning;mathematical optimization;precondition	Roman Beck;Oliver Marschollek;Robert Wayne Gregory	2010	IJITPM	10.4018/jitpm.2010100102	public relations;management;information technology;boundary spanning	HCI	-78.69140147445894	0.8919268418160057	40999

These issues have been found to influence the willingness of researchers to publish data created during the course of their research. We use the results of a survey conducted by the working groups of the DataONE project to present a new understanding of challenges to the development of global data collections and preservation by systematically examining the determinants of the researchersu0027 likelihood to openly publish research data. This study found two key determinants affecting researchersu0027 willingness to publish their data. First is data management in terms of data management skills and organization support. Second is the acknowledgement of the data setu0027s originator in terms of appreciation and legal and policy requirements. This study also found that the impact of the significant determinants is contingent on the amount of data to be published. Finally, this study calls for further investigation to ascertain the relationship of data management and data quality, and systematic investigation on the roles and responsibility of government within these global data preservations.

However, these progressive steps are yet to reach millions of disabled persons in rural Bangladesh. Around 13 million people in Bangladesh are physically handicapped of which 3 million are children. Disability is increasing with population growth and ageing. Disability on this scale represents not only a major health issue but also a prime cause of poverty and underdevelopment. Information and Communication Technology (ICT), opens up great opportunities to improve the quality of life of disabled people failing which will further the digital divide. This paper proposes to discuss the importance of ICT development and accessibility for persons with disabilities in Bangladesh and elaborate on how ICT has been utilized thus far and how we can further these initiatives towards development.	bridging (networking)	Mahjabeen Khaled Hossain	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-14097-6_84	development economics;engineering;socioeconomics;economic growth	HCI	-79.18515219408333	-9.964784427630262	41119
82e681a1930c9ef36118044b204aa0e633702473	using abm to clarify and refine social practice theory		We use an agent-based model to help to refine and clarify social practice theory, wherein the focus is neither on individuals nor on any form of societal totality, but on the repeated performances of practices ordered across space and time. The recursive relationship between social practices and practitioners (individuals performing practices) is strongly emphasised in social practice theory. We intend to have this recursive relationship unfold dynamically in a model where practitioners and social practices are both considered as agents. Model conceptualisation is based on the principle of structuration theory – the focus is neither on micro causing macro nor on macro influencing micro, but on the duality between structure (macro) and agency (micro). In our case, we conceptualise the duality between practitioners and practices based on theoretical insights from social practices literature; where information is unclear or insufficient, we make systematic assumptions and account for these.	agent-based model;performance;recursion	Kavin Preethi Narasimhan;Thomas Roberts;Maria Xenitidou;G.

Probably the oldest of these tendencies is the emphasis on planned urban development which has existed for millennia and which in the last century has demonstrated considerable vitality as a reaction to the excesses of the industrial revolution and the poverty and squalor of nineteenth-century cities. A second strand is the development of economic and sociological theory which goes a considerable distance in explaining some aspects of the organization and form of metropolitan settlement and its growth. These theories have a long history, but have matured principally during the 1920's and 1930's. Finally, as a methodological catalyst, the development of the automobile, of a Federal Bureau of Public Roads dedicated to providing facilities for it, and of the large-scale metropolitan study based on the origin-and-destination survey have together made possible the crystallization and further growth of simulation methods. These methods are thus proximately based on the engineering attitude and computer technology of the large-scale transportation study, but they are in a position to draw on a number of other important streams of intellectual development.	capability maturity model;computer simulation;confluence;piaget's theory of cognitive development;strand (programming language)	Britton Harris	1972		10.1145/1479992.1480048	simulation;engineering;operations management	DB	-74.8869265007026	-9.014064460389008	41186

The formation of the DAISY Consortium in 1996 led to the concept and fundamental ideas of the digital talking book. The result is an international standard for digital talking books, which is now becoming a multimedia standard. DAISY has developed new partnerships, new working methods, and new ways of thinking. The digital vision has improved library services to print-impaired people and changed the participating libraries themselves. Today some DAISY libraries are close to becoming fully digitized, and DAISY technology is heading into mainstream use. Users may soon be entering a global virtual library, and the DAISY experience may in many aspects serve as a model for future library developments. Introduction Imagine entering a library without a single physical lending item on the shelves, without books in print, actually without shelves, just large cooled servers, whirring digital archives linked through digital networks with machines for copying and distribution. No whispering, no shushing. It is not science fiction or the librarian’s nightmare. It is actually a dream come true. The DAISY Consortium1 was formed in 1996 to take advantage of new digital opportunities.

This paper explores the American governments' and citizens' use of social network sites SNS, namely Facebook and YouTube, to conceptualize and debate about national crises, in order to bring about social change, a notion that is synonymous with societal improvement on a national level. Drawing on democratic theories of communication, the public sphere, and emerging scholarship on the Right to Communicate, this study reveals the advantageous nature of SNS for political means: from citizen to citizen, government to citizen, and citizen to government. Furthermore, SNS promote government transparency, and provide citizens with a forum to pose questions to the White House, exchange ideas, and generate goals and strategies necessary for social change. While it remains the government's responsibility to promote such exchanges, the onus remains with citizens to extend their participation to active engagement outside of SNS if social change is to occur. The Obama Administration's unique affinity to SNS usage is explored to extrapolate knowledge of SNS in a political context during times of crises.	social networks;social network	Mahmoud Eid;Jenna Bresolin Slade	2012	IJT	10.4018/jte.2012100101	public relations;economics;socioeconomics;social change;sociology;law	AI	-79.91243395697302	-13.496662279481175	41290

In this paper, I address those assumptions. I trace their origin in the human-computation metaphor, and argue that while this metaphor is instrumental in facilitating novel developments, it also constrains the thinking of designers. I discuss some of the limitations this metaphor might impose, and offer that additional perspectives, such as an organizational design perspective and the distributed cognition perspective can help us think of novel possibilities of organizing work with crowd sourcing. I call for extending the conversation among computer-scientists and organizational researchers, and propose that the metaphor of 'information processing' might serve as a 'boundary-object' around which the dialogue among these communities can thrive.	crowdsourcing;distributed cognition;human-based computation;information processing;organizing (structure);social computing	Yiftach Nagar	2011	2011 IEEE Third Int'l Conference on Privacy, Security, Risk and Trust and 2011 IEEE Third Int'l Conference on Social Computing	10.1109/PASSAT/SocialCom.2011.205	social science;human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;management science;collective intelligence;management;social computing;organizational architecture;outsourcing	Visualization	-82.28588361581666	-4.467020177859244	41320
128fe7d1986affcff47d62111d988449fead9d71	preface to the focus theme section: 'vertical industry information technology standards and standardization,	information technology	Standardized business documents, data definitions, item description and identification and business processes have been seen as key to effective interorganizational commerce since the 1980s, when electronic data interchange (EDI) became the technology of choice for business-to-business coordination. Vertical information systems (VIS) standards are designed to promote communication and coordination among the organizations comprising a particular industry sector. Unfortunately, despite much promotion, EDI standards achieved only limited adoption; an estimated 2% of the world’s businesses, including just 300,000 US companies, have adopted EDI. Low penetration of electronic interconnection standards, particularly around business semantics, is believed to hinder electronic business and supply-chain integration. Recently, the availability of open Internet protocols and technologies, particularly eXtensible Markup Language (XML), has given a boost to both the adoption of EDI and the development of vertical (that is, industry-specific) XML-based data and process standards. Vertical efforts to develop such standards have emerged in electronics (RosettaNet), mortgage (MISMO), chemicals (CIDX), insurance (ACORD), petroleum (PIDX) and several other industries. Many observers expect these developments to lower the cost of electronic connection and spur adoption, particularly among smaller firms. However, some analysts believe that there may be public goods problems associated with the development of industry-wide standards. Larger companies with larger capital bases invest in the creation and maintenance of the standards, while smaller companies benefit from their adoption. This special issue is predicated on the idea that VIS standards have important differences from IT products and services standards and therefore require their own theory and empirical research. As several authors note, for example, VIS standards development is more likely to involve users participating in voluntary consortia than generic standards. How such user participation influences the collective action dynamics within standards consortia, as well as the technical choices that such consortia make, represents an area for new research. The assumption that VIS standardization is different may not be correct, but the only way to test it is to undertake systematic C op yr ig h t 2 0 0 5 El ec tr on ic M ar ke ts	business process;command & conquer:yuri's revenge;electronic business;electronic data interchange;information system;interconnection;markup language;rosettanet;xml	Rolf T.

aebe27a0055275a5eedbc5f2882db43f4854bdc4	understanding the drivers of unethical programming behavior: the inappropriate reuse of internet-accessible code		Programming is riddled with issues of ethical nature. However, while extant literature explains why individuals in IT would act unethically in many situations, we know surprisingly little about what causes them to do so during the creative act of programming. To address this issue, we look at the reuse of Internet-accessible code: software source code legally available for gratis download from the Internet. Specifically, we scrutinize the reasons why individuals would unethically reuse such code by not checking or purposefully violating its accompanying license obligations, thus risking harm for their employer. By integrating teleological and deontological ethical judgments into a theory of planned behavior model — using elements of expected utility, deterrence, and ethical work climate theory — we construct an original theoretical framework to capture individuals’ decision making process leading to the unethical reuse of Internet-accessible code. We test this framework with a unique survey of 869 professional software developers. Our findings advance the theoretical and practical understanding of ethical behavior in information systems. We show that programmers use consequentialist ethical judgments when carrying out creative tasks and that ethical work climates influence programmers indirectly through their peers’ judgment of what is appropriate behavior. For practice, where code reuse promises substantial efficiency and quality gains, our results highlight that firms can prevent unethical code reuse by informing developers of its negative consequences, building a work climate that fosters compliance with laws and professional codes, and making sure that excessive time pressure is avoided.

What does this have to do with ethics? Quite a lot, because digitally stored images can be copied and altered with an ease that has not previously been possible. The moral issues raised by this new technology are not new in themselves, but are given new urgency by both the ease and the undetectability afforded by this digital storage. It would be silly to argue that all uses of digital technology for image storage give cause for concern, but not all applications are beneficial or even benign.	digital electronics	John Weckert;Douglas Adeney	1994		10.1145/199544.199597	public relations;simulation;computer science;computer security	Graphics	-71.94158318740382	-11.633397428185562	41347
17eec4389cb489591fcebde1eb2c6160b43cfbde	the potential of agritourism in revitalizing rural communities: some empirical results		Modern patterns of rural development propose a rational and respectful exploitation of agricultural resources together with the rediscovery of historical and naturalistic heritage as means to reach sustainable development. In this sense, Agritourism represents the contact point between the tourists’ request of wellbeing, genuineness and rediscovery of nature, and the offer of typical agricultural products and touristic services of a network of rural organizations. The aim of this study is to improve our understanding of how agritourism activities can contribute to revitalize rural communities; the study assumes particular importance in a period of economic crisis characterized by the failure of the traditional patterns of rural development. We present key findings of an explorative survey carried out in the Calabria region, Italy, during 2012 on a sample of 52 farms offering agritourism activities. The study deploys an original methodology aimed to highlight the extent of the agritourism phenomena in the selected region and to evaluate how agritourism can support sustainable development of a rural community becoming the hub of an “agritourism rural network”	ethernet hub;network model;the hub (forum);usb hub	Salvatore Ammirato;Alberto M.

The data available in these public markets offer interesting opportunities to study Internet auctions. We explore techniques for identifying common bidding patterns on eBay using data from eBay video game console auctions. The analysis reveals that there are certain bidding behaviors that appear frequently in the data, some of which have been previously identified and others which are new. We propose new attributes of bidding engagements and rules for classifying strategies. In addition, we suggest economic motivations that might lead to the identified behaviors. We then apply a clustering algorithm to look at each bidder’s behavior across several engagements, and find a few natural clusters. Finally, we apply association rule analysis to the data and find cases of likely shill behavior, but find no cross-correlation with any particular bidding behavior.	algorithm;association rule learning;auction algorithm;cluster analysis;cross-correlation;data mining;internet;interpreter (computing);offset binary;simulation;software agent;virtual community	Harshit S.

27fd2a084917c613ee9cda3961345de4c97a28de	the chiasmus of design: paradoxical outcomes in the e-government reform of uk children's services	computer driving licecse;training;ease of use;self efficacy;anxiety	This paper presents a detailed ethnographic study of the design problems of a major national IT system in UK child protection and welfare services. The implementation of the Integrated Children’s System (ICS) has disrupted social work practice and engendered growing professional resistance, prompting a fundamental review of its design. Marshall McLuhan’s concept of chiasmus is a central feature of the analysis presented here of the tribulations of the ICS. Chiasmus refers to the tendency of any system, when pushed too far, to produce unintended contradictory effects, and is an intrinsic feature of the behaviour of complex, socio-technical systems. The dysfunctions of the ICS provide a pertinent, large-scale example. The ICS constitutes an attempt, via technological means, to reorganize child welfare services in the UK. Whilst aimed at improving child safety, the ICS has had the opposite effect of increasing the potential for error. This chiasmus has been exposed through the multi-site ethnography reported here, which shows how rigidly designed processes, enforced by IT systems, force social work professionals into unsafe investigative and recording practices which put children at greater risk. The paper ends by proposing an alternative approach to design, based on proven socio-technical precepts, emphasizing the principles of minimum critical specification, usercenteredness and local autonomy.	e-government;relevance;sociotechnical system;while	David Graham Wastell;Sue White;Karen Broadhurst	2009			simulation;medicine;social psychology;clinical psychology	HCI	-83.30752734373804	-5.2446905235722125	41435

The study consisted of an Internet based survey that asked respondents to identify the top five issues in computer forensics. 60 respondents answered the survey using a free form text field. The results indicated that education/training and certification were the most reported issue (18%) and lack of funding was the least reported (4%). These findings are consistent with a similar law enforcement community study (Stambaugh et al., 2001). The findings emphasize the fragmented nature of the computer forensics discipline. Currently there is a lack of a national framework for curricula and training development, and no gold standard for professional certification. The findings further support the criticism that there is a disproportional focus on the applied aspects of computer forensics, at the expense of the development of fundamental theories. Further implications of the findings are discussed as well as suggestions for future research in the area.	computer forensics;internet;needs analysis;theory;word lists by frequency	Marcus K.

A lot of the ITS applications rely on identifying the location of a user whether it is a cellular subscriber, a passenger car, a fleet vehicle or a public transport vehicle. A lot of the ITS applications also involve the cooperation between different industry players whether these are cellular companies, equipment, car manufacturers, terminal suppliers, system integrators or content providers. This paper identifies all these services which are location dependent under the banner Mobile Location Services. It also looks into the market structure and identifies the opportunities for each player involved.

However, little is known about how people are using information targeted to a specific audience, and what happens as a result of this use. We partnered with 'Naitre & Grandir' (N&G), a magazine, website and newsletter offering trustworthy parenting information on child growth, development and health/wellbeing. This study was designed to uncover the outcomes of online parenting information. We used the theory-driven Information Assessment Method (IAM) to study parental perceptions regarding outcomes of specific N&G web pages. A research question was: Is there a difference between parents with a low level of education and income vs. other parents? Over an 8-month study period, 4007 participants submitted 4862 IAM ratings that suggested N&G information was valuable in terms of situational relevance (93.7%), positive cognitive impact (92.9%), intention to use (85.7%), and expectation for child health/well-being benefit (82.4%). In addition, results suggested participants with a low level of education and income were more likely to (i) seek and use information for the child of someone else, and (ii) expect being more engaged in decision-making for their child, and being less worried regarding a problem concerning their child. Our results do not support an association between the combined level of income and education, and perceived outcomes of information. This is the first study to assess outcomes of emailed parenting information from a parental viewpoint. More research is needed to better understand outcomes of targeted online information, which may ultimately contribute to improve people’s health/well-being.	email;identity management;relevance;web page	Pierre Pluye;Reem El Sherif;Gillian Bartlett;Vera Granikov;Roland M.

Specifically, the research examines the impact these experiences have in terms of women’s Internet website activities, Internet personal activities (such as E-mail) and nonInternet personal and/or social activities. The study is based on 17 in-depth, semistructured online interviews with self-identified feminists who are Web designers of feminist sites. Interviews were conducted through E-mail and explored various online experiences. Previous research suggests a contradictory and often conflictual relationship between women and technology. However, the specific relationship between women and the Internet has received relatively little attention. This article addresses women’s positive and negative experiences. For example, flaming, spamming, harassing posts (in different contexts), and sexual harassment are some negative reactions to women who include feminist thought on their websites. Positive responses received by women often serve to encourage online activities for women and create a network or community of women on the Internet. The intention of this research is to investigate whether Internet is indeed a medium that gives “voice” to women and women’s	cyberspace;experience;exploratory testing;flaming (internet);internet;mail (macos);spamming;web design;yahoo mail	Tracy L.

He has now done a multiple regression analysis jointly testing (1) article age, (2) journal impact factor, (3) number of authors, and (4) OA self-archiving as separate factors for 442,750 articles in 576 (biomedical) journals across 11 years, and has shown that each of the four factors contributes an independent, statistically significant increment to the citation counts. The OA-self-archiving advantage remains a robust, independent factor. Having successfully responded to his challenge, we now challenge Eysenbach to demonstrate -by testing a sufficiently broad and representative sample of journals at all levels of the journal quality, visibility and prestige hierarchy -that his finding of a citation advantage for Gold OA (articles published OA on the high-profile website of the only journal he tested (PNAS) over Green OA articles in the same journal (self-archived on the author's website) was not just an artifact of having tested only one very high-profile journal.	archive;file archiver;subject matter expert turing test;uncontrolled format string	Chawki Hajjem;Stevan Harnad	2007	CoRR		digital library;computer science;data mining;statistical significance;confounding;information retrieval;regression analysis;statistics	Security	-78.47057138132375	-21.381385159696617	41580

A Moroccan library's specialized collection on the Muslim West (Ibn Rushd) offers culturally adapted intellectual access to materials through the Ibn Rushd Thesaurus (IRT) and accompanying classification scheme. This paper compares the specialized Moroccan scheme for describing location in the historical and modern Muslim West and the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) scheme's notations for the same locations. The systems differ primarily in their approaches to grouping land masses and to considering history. DDC, when used in conjunction with the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names Online (TGN) easily provides access to 80% of Moroccan and Western Saharan locations listed in the IRT, to 92% of Iberian locations, and to other Moroccan and Western Saharan locations not mentioned in the IRT. The benefits of providing culturally-adapted access to a specialized collection include a more intuitive approach to access for users in accordance with the contents of the collection. Drawbacks include potentially isolating Muslim scholars from a globalized approach to describing location and reinforcing a specialized worldview.	geographic coordinate system	Heather Lea Moulaison	2010		10.1002/meet.14504701134	social science;sociology;law;world wide web;culture;taxonomy	HCI	-78.94623304015889	-15.985268288008596	41636

In the present paper, we argue that a suboptimal cybersecurity environment is partly due to organizations’ underinvestment and a lack of suitable policies. The motivation for this paper stems from a related policy question: how to design policies for governments and other organizations that can ensure a sufficient level of cybersecurity. We address the question by exploring a policy devised to alleviate information asymmetry and to achieve transparency in cybersecurity information sharing practice. We introduce a cybersecurity evaluation agency along with regulations on information disclosure. To empirically evaluate the effectiveness of such an institution, we conduct a large-scale randomized field experiment on 7,919 U.S. organizations. Specifically, we generate organizations’ security reports based on their outbound spam relative to the industry peers, then share the reports with the subjects in either private or public ways. Using models for heterogeneous treatment effects and machine learning techniques, we find evidence that the security information sharing combined with publicity treatment has significant effects on spam reduction for original large spammers. Moreover, significant peer effects are observed among industry peers after the experiment.	experiment;spamming	Shu He;Gene Moo Lee;Sukjin Han;Andrew B. Whinston	2016	J.

But what happens when a meeting is over? Is that the end of the meeting conversation? This study empirically demonstrates that meetings are not discrete events; rather they are a form of persistent conversation processes, involving combinations of ICTs and face-toface communication. Conversations between meetings contribute to a meeting process-perspective and link to the development of bonding and bridging social capital. The findings suggest that the frequency of face-to-face conversations and text messaging between meetings, positively impact bonding social capital. Peoples’ attitudes toward continuing conversations between meetings positively impacts bridging social capital. The frequency of using many contemporary ICTs—e.g., Facebook, Twitter, and GroupMe—between meetings was not a significant predictor in developing social capital, even in a sample of young adults.	bridging (networking);kerrison predictor;social capital	Keri Stephens;Ignacio Cruz;Eric Waters;Yaguang Zhu	2017			public relations;social capital;socioeconomics;management	HCI	-85.32525500068017	-15.181516694626335	41755

We collected data consisting of a total of 264 responses from individuals with previous experience with purchasing products from online shopping mall sites, and utilized the PLS (partial least squares) method to analyze the collected data. Our findings demonstrated that consumers with greater product involvement tended to shop in shopping malls, where they could obtain more information on products, and that consumers with low product involvement tended to be more willing to consider entertainment. Additionally, consumers with higher levels of trust toward websites tended to be influenced by perceived entertainment and thus stay longer at shopping sites; conversely, consumers with low levels of trust toward websites tended to be more willing to consider perceived informativeness as minimizing environmental uncertainty. On the basis of our results, online shopping malls must stress the intrinsic attributes of products to attract highly-involved consumers and must present a benevolent corporate image for consumers concerned with better service. Our results also demonstrated that, for less-involved consumers who wish to search for products to present, it may be appropriate to mix entertainment components with product information, and also to implement creative web interface designs for more effective browsing. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We present a series of experiments on political discussion data. Our experiments indicate that (i) when people quote contributors with an opposing view, they tend to quote the words that are less strongly associated with the opposing view. (ii) Nevertheless, in quoting their opponents, the displayed bias of their word distributions shifts towards that of their opponents. (iii) The personal bias of the speaker is displayed most clearly through the words that are not quoted, (iv) although characteristics of the quoted message do have a measurable effect on the words that are included in the contribution. And, finally, (v) posts are influenced by the displayed bias of previous posts in a thread.	emoticon;experiment;lexical choice	Dong Nguyen;Elijah Mayfield;Carolyn Penstein Rosé	2010		10.1145/1964858.1964865	psychology;public relations;communication;social psychology	HCI	-86.67055554683164	-16.67874399130916	41779

The results suggest that perceived likelihood of victimization predicts fear of victimization in traditional contexts. Women tend to be more fearful of victimization in traditional and cyber contexts, confirming previous research. No group differences emerged in relation to education. Self-esteem and self-efficacy were not significant predictors of fear or perceived likelihood of victimization. However, perceived likelihood was a significant predictor of fear of victimization in traditional settings. This may suggest that different variables (such as awareness of vulnerability) may play a role in fear of victimization in cyber settings. Further group comparisons revealed that fear of victimization and cyber-victimization depended on whether or not participants reported high or low perceived likelihood of victimization and internet use. Higher internet use was associated with greater fear of victimization, especially in combination with greater perceived likelihood of victimization. This may suggest an exposure effect, in that being online more frequently may also increase awareness of cyber incidents.

The article looks through the experience of the last 7 years of life on RCM—the Milan Community Network—to reflect on the role that the sharing of rules of behavior has on the evolution of social structure in a virtual community. It identifies three phases of development—the design phase, the first growth phase, and the most recent phase—and presents the social structure set up to guarantee governance of the CN. The conclusions show that the third phase is not an actual stable state, as the continuous evolution of the societal and technological context requires continuous redesign of the CN itself in order to meet the renewed demands of a new context.	social structure	Fiorella de Cindio;Oliverio Gentile;Philip Grew;Daniela Redolfi	2003	Inf.

Three specific domains of knowledge are considered in this analysis: “production support” knowledge, “control support” knowledge and “cognition support” knowledge. Findings from a survey of 82 senior IT professionals showed that the adoption of methodologies helps to embed valuable knowledge into the IS development process. The routine utilization of the stock of knowledge hence embedded allows to improve the IS development process and the performance of IS development projects.

Our study is one of the first to focus exclusively on what might motivate nonadopters to accept a widely adopted IT. By considering nonadopters’ inertia within the context of early stages of innovation diffusion and incorporating status quo bias theory into well-established technology acceptance model (TAM) relationships, this study uncovers the finding that people who report that they do not use OSNS would use them if they thought OSNS were easier and more enjoyable to use, and if they were persuaded by others to use them. Our findings suggest these nonadopters do not see the usefulness of OSNS, risks of sharing personal information publically, or the perceived amount of effort in using OSNS as factors that influence potential acceptance and use of the technology. This study contributes to research by offering an integrated theoretical framework that updates TAM with status quo bias theory to study nonadopters and offers IS practice guidelines for OSNS providers to attract nonadopters to accept and use the technology.	social network	Tao Hu;Robin S.

Gamification, as a means of engaging consumers [6, 10, 16], has become more and more popular and implemented in a range of user-oriented applications. However studies have shown that it may not always have the type of impact as initially projected [12, 13]. Gamification yields different, sometimes contradictory, results with regard to the engagement outcomes. Researchers have argued that gamification is not always properly implemented and may not have consistent positive effects [14], as the reward mechanisms and intensified competition could create a controlling gaming environment that could dampen the intrinsic motivation of the participants [13]. Therefore, it is important for businesses and organizations to be able to gauge the impact of gamified interventions and evaluate return on investment.	gamification	Laura C. Amo;Ruochen Liao;H.

The purpose of this qualitative, exploratory study is to clarify ambiguous concepts in intelligence services literature specifically related to measurement of intelligence outcomes and impact. Method. Face to face interviews were held with five subject experts from various intelligence fields and countries regarding their conceptualizations of intelligence measurement. Participants were given the opportunity post-interview to review and edit responses, to ensure accuracy. Analysis. Participant responses were compared and contrasted in defining key terms, descriptions of current practice in outcome measurement, and requirements for future best practice. Results. Participants' definitions of terms and conceptual lenses varied. Participants' descriptions of their own practices in, and reactions to, measuring outcomes and impacts were unique to the participant and paralleled discussions in the literature. Suggestions for best practice were made. Participants agreed that improvements to current measurement practice are both possible and necessary, and called for conceptual developments in intelligence measurement. Conclusions. The authors intend this study to provide a starting point for comparative discussion regarding intelligence measurement, and the need for conceptual developments, in a field that has historically been dominated by prescriptive measurement models and unique accounts of measurement practice.	best practice;requirement	Rhiannon Gainor;France Bouthillier	2014	Inf.

53327f5c3932abf8989b32e8f92b4a61a478719a	'houston, we've had a problem ...'		T he topic of IS employment, offshoring, and how perceptions do not equal reality is important, but should not be surprising. This train wreck has been coming for some time – and outsourcing or offshoring is only the most recent and most visible symptom of a systemic lack of respect for the IT profession as a whole in much of North American and Western Europe. Hirschheim and Newman do a great job of presenting their interpretation of issues that many of us are dealing with every day. As faculty, we try to help students prepare for their future careers, even as we struggle with the angst of lost employment within our own schools and departments. I am impressed that the authors take on this topic and that they tackle the perceptual issues associated with offshoring of information systems jobs. It is a frustrating problem and one we need to do something about. I was somewhat disappointed at first that this was only a conceptual paper, rather than one that presented new data; however, they do an excellent job building their arguments with the available evidence. They have indeed hit on many of the major issues and debates that came to my own mind. As examples, I was happy to see that they address the socalled ‘IT identity crisis,’ commoditization, different social value, and how jobs have changed due to offshoring. While they do a good job arguing that much of the ‘problem’ is perceptual, our opinions differ in how our discipline should deal with it. I’ll focus on just three interrelated cultural arguments they have either ignored or misinterpreted. First, the authors present a rather naı̈ve suggestion that faculty should get out there to make a difference. Second, the authors totally ignore the negative role of university and school administrators and the cultural conflict that exists in most schools. Lastly, they presume that people have a clear idea of what the IT profession is all about in the first place. First, the authors argue that faculty should get out there and convince high-school children and parents that there really are IT jobs available when they graduate that won’t take the kids (and future grandkids) to foreign climes. Their argument presumes two things: first, that faculty are qualified to sell the IT profession and, second, that they have the time, resources, motivation, and incentives to do so. The first point may be an overly optimistic view of IS faculty’s marketing skills and available time. Regardless of the professional background of IS faculty, few of us are trained in marketing or public affairs such that we could mount an effective effort to change public perceptions one faculty-member at a time. We have enough problems convincing our own colleagues in other departments that we add value to the school’s curriculum. Untenured faculty are generally working 60 hr weeks to meet tenure requirements or external assessment requirements, so that they have a chance at another job should their own departments retrench or decline them. Tenured faculty are not particularly motivated to get out there and perform pro bono work on behalf of an institution that is treating them as if low IS enrollments are their fault, and showing little, if any, support for them in the first place. Hirschheim and Newman mention the lack of academic jobs – but those faculty who have jobs are often facing marginalization, reduced resources, and dysfunctional competition for students within their own institutions. My second point builds on this sad reality of the turf wars and lack of respect frequently paid to the IS function in both academic and other sectors. There is plenty of research (my own and others) that shows there are cultural assumptions about information technologies and about IT professionals that impact resources provided, championship of IT-enabled innovation, and desirability of IT careers (e.g. Kaarst-Brown and Robey, 1999; Kaarst-Brown, 2005; Guzman, 2006; Guzman and Stanton, 2009; Jin, 2010). A school’s dominant cultural view that IT is potentially dangerous (‘fearful’), needs to be controlled (‘controlled’), or that anyone can do it (‘demystified’), for example, is unlikely to offer support for IS faculty survival. Beyond the ‘geek’ stereotype that may be country-specific and is changing, is the reality that many academic institutions have done absolutely nothing to help encourage additional enrollments in an IS discipline they don’t believe in or compete with for resources. Universities have been subsidizing the Classics, Arts, Math, and Philosophy academic programs for decades. They view these as essential knowledge for graduates from their programs and ‘perceptually’ important units for a top university. What are top administrators’ views of the IT faculty and programs? – clearly, not as important. Where are the scholarships for the IS students? Where are the extra staff to work on enrollment management for IS programs?

Some of the more popular models used for this purpose are: Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), and Innovations Diffusion Theory, among others. Recently, Venkatesh, Morris, Davis, and Davis [16] tried to unify the different constructs of all these models in one unique model, and with this in mind developed the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). It is the objective of this study to test the usefulness of this model in the context of end user consumption, a task not specifically attempted by Venkatesh, et al. The setting for this test is Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology. As with any new technology, consumers' adoption process of VoIP has been slow [8]. VoIP phones are not free of some disadvantages so suppliers need information about what factors are more important to customers. Suppliers can then develop strategies to increase the speed of the adoption process in order to maximize their profits. It was the intention of this study that as a by-product of testing the UTAUT model, information would be developed that is useful to the companies and end-users of VoIP. The UTAUT Model With the intention to formulate a comprehensive model that considered the variables included in previous theory aimed at explaining adoption behavior, Venkatesh, et al. [16], developed a way to test each of the constructs from eight pre-existing models: Theory of reasoned action [7], technology acceptance model [5], motivational model [4] [6] [17], theory of planned behavior [1], combined TAM and TPB [11] [13], model of PC utilization [14], innovation diffusion theory [12], and cognitive theory [3]. They presented a summary of prior model comparison studies and an empirical synthesis of the different models. Finally, with the variables that showed the biggest impact, they described a new model called Unified Theory or Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). According to the authors, this model accounted for up to 70 percent of the variance (adjusted R 2) in usage intention and it is a definitive model that summarizes what is	cognitive science;ibm tivoli access manager;model selection	Eduardo Esteva-Armida;Alberto Rubio-Sanchez	2012	IJESMA	10.4018/jesma.2012100102	simulation;economics;marketing;advertising;world wide web;consumer behaviour	ECom	-90.89050242575834	-6.665418415662163	42109

To address this limitation, we integrate three intergroup theories (social dominance, gendered prejudice, and social identity) and complement the traditional emphasis on aggressors and targets with an emphasis on observers. In three studies, we test two primary expectations: (1) when racial slurs are exchanged, whites will act in a manner more consistent with social dominance than blacks; and (2) this difference will be greater for white and black men than for white and black women. In a survey (n = 471), we show that whites are less likely to be targets of racial slurs and are more likely to target blacks than blacks are to target them. We also show that the difference between white and black men is greater than the difference between white and black women. In an archival study that spans five years (n = 2,480), we found that white men are more likely to observe racial slurs than are black men, and that the difference between white and black men is greater than the difference between white and black women. In a behavioral study (n = 133), analyses showed that whites who observe racial slurs are more likely to remain silent than blacks who observe slurs. We also find that social dominance orientation (SDO) predicts observer silence and that racial identification enhances the effect of race on SDO for men, but not for women. Further, mediated moderation analyses show that SDO mediates the effect of the interaction between race, gender, and racial identification on observer silence.	archive;theory	Ashleigh Shelby Rosette;Andrew M.

9548033ea314585e940a7fac5cc167ad1e51794f	why people continue to use social networking services: developing a comprehensive model	social networking;social influence;social exchange;flow experience;social capital	Social networking (SNW) services such as Facebook and MySpace are growing exponentially. While many people are spending an increasing amount of their time on the services, others use them minimally or discontinue use after a short period of time. This research is asking the question: What are the salient factors influencing individuals to continue using and extending the range of SNW services after their initial acceptance? This research recognizes that long-term viability and the eventual success of these services depends on continued usage rather than initial acceptance, and usage continuance of SNW services at the individual level is fundamental to the survival of many social technology-empowered businesses and organizations. We look to the Expectation-Confirmation Model of information systems (IS) continuance and a series of social theories as the underlying theoretical foundations. We develop the Usage Continuance Model of SNW Services to investigate continued usage behavior and enduring impacts of SNW services. The model proposes that usage continuance behavior of SNW services is a joint function of individuals’ perceptions of (1) intrinsic flow experience of SNW services, expected instrumentality of SNW services in managing and improving informational and relational values, and social influence as the outgrowth of social capital, and (2) costs in informational risks and participative efforts of time and social exchanges. The joint function is moderated by individuals’ use history of SNW features. The proposed model and hypotheses offer a comprehensive framework for empirically extending the IS continuance research to the ever pervasive SNW context.	causality;cognition;information systems;information system;pervasive informatics;social capital;storage networking world	Tao Hu;William J.

324411b788c8212408e9e34973c9dbb27e94060b	how tight are the ties that bind stakeholder groups?	symbolic predisposition;collective self interest;stakeholder homogeneity;intercollegiate athletics;stakeholder management	The purpose of stakeholder management is to facilitate our understanding of increasingly unpredictable external environments, thereby facilitating our ability to manage within these environments. We argue that a powerful implicit assumption within the stakeholder literature—that priorities within rolebased stakeholder groups are relatively homogeneous—blurs our understanding of organization-stakeholder relationships. Two important and related areas of concern are presented. The first involves the primacy of role in stakeholder definition. This role primacy approach to stakeholder definition is appropriate if, for a particular issue, role-based stakeholder group members have similar priorities. Individual and collective self-interest provides a rationale for this assumption. However, an important problem with this approach arises in situations in which selfinterest is not the primary motivator of individuals’ priorities. In these instances, subgroups within different role-based stakeholder groups might have more similar priorities than either subgroup has with others within their role-based stakeholder group. In these situations the role primacy approach impedes, rather than facilitates, an understanding of our environment. Our second concern is related to insufficient rigor in the application of stakeholder analysis. Most stakeholder studies, both theoretical and empirical, fall short in the determination of relevant interests and the subsequent subdivision of role-based stakeholder groups into rigorously defined specific stakeholder groups. Having suggested that the role primacy approach to stakeholder definition is less than ideal, we examine the extent to which, and the conditions under which, roles are likely to determine priorities, and thus, the likelihood of relatively homogeneous priorities within role-based stakeholder groups. In addition, we present an illustrative empirical analysis of stakeholder group priorities. The illustrative study is conducted within the context of intercollegiate athletics. Related literature and our empirical results indicate that role-based self-interest frequently is not a sufficient “binding tie” of stakeholder groups. Given this background, we present an alternative approach to stakeholder analysis that borrows heavily from the customer segmentation literature of marketing. Our alternative approach can accommodate heterogeneous priorities within role-based stakeholder groups. (Stakeholder Management; Intercollegiate Athletics; Stakeholder Homogeneity; Collective Self-Interest; Symbolic Predisposition) The stakeholder concept is deceptively simple. It is “simple” because it is easy to identify those groups and individuals who can affect, or are affected by, the achievement of an organization’s purpose. It is “deceptive,” because once stakeholders are identified, the task of managing the relationships with them is enormous (Freeman 1984 p. 246; emphasis added). The purpose of stakeholder management is to facilitate our understanding of, and thereby our ability to manage within, increasingly unpredictable external environments. “Given the turbulence that . . . organizations are currently facing and the very nature of the external environment, as consisting of economic and socio-political forces, there is a need for conceptual schemata which analyze these forces in an integrative fashion” (Freeman 1984, p. 40). The desired result of stakeholder management is to more closely align corporate priorities and actions with stakeholder needs. It is hypothesized that creating this alignment produces a good fit between the organization and its environment, thus increasing the probability of the organization’s success. Understanding the priorities of and dealing with identifiable stakeholders—any group that can affect, or is affected by, the achievement of an organization’s objectives (Freeman 1984, p. 46)—offers strategic and cognitive efficiency advantages over conceiving of an organization’s environment as being composed of innumerable individuals and institutions. The cognitive efficiency advantages attributed to stakeholder management derive from its provision of a systematic approach for conceptualizing, comprehending, and RICHARD A. WOLFE AND DANIEL S. PUTLER How Tight Are the Ties that Bind Stakeholder Groups? ORGANIZATION SCIENCE/Vol. 13, No. 1, January–February 2002 65 analyzing external environments. Focusing on relatively few identifiable stakeholders, as opposed to innumerable individuals and institutions, provides a simplified and more easily comprehended representation of the organization’s world. Consequently, the stakeholder approach to management can be considered a knowledge structure that determines how a manager selectively perceives, evaluates, and interprets attributes of the environment. The use of a knowledge structure can facilitate information processing and decision making (Walsh 1995). However, the use of a knowledge structure is not without risk. As argued convincingly by Allison (1971), fundamental choices among the categories and assumptions of knowledge structures channel our thinking and influence our understanding. The often implicit nature of our conceptual models contributes to a lack of cognizance of what they magnify and reveal as well as what they blur or neglect. Allison surmised that it is important for researchers and practitioners to consider the assumptions inherent in the conceptual models they adopt, how these assumptions channel their thinking, and what other perspectives are available. We believe that much of the stakeholder literature is prone to the magnifying, blurring, and/or neglecting described by Allison. Development of stakeholder theory has concentrated on stakeholder analysis—attempts to classify stakeholders into categories that provide an understanding of how stakeholder groups can influence a firm (Rowley 1997). There is agreement in the literature concerning the major steps involved in stakeholder analysis: (1) identification of stakeholder groups (e.g., employees, owners, communities, customers); (2) determination of the stakeholders’ interests; and (3) evaluation of the type and level of stakeholder power (Wood 1994) or salience (Mitchell et al. 1997). We argue that powerful, though implicit, assumptions of the type suggested by Allison influence both the methods used to define stakeholder groups (the first two steps above) and how rigorously these methods have been applied. Our first and primary area of concern involves the methods used to define stakeholder groups in stakeholder analysis. The basis of this concern is the primacy of role in stakeholder definition. As described above, stakeholder analysis begins with identifying relevant role-based stakeholder groups and then determining the relevant interests (in other words the “stakes”) of individuals within each identified stakeholder group. This approach is appropriate if, for a particular issue, members of a rolebased stakeholder group have similar priorities. Not all stakeholder group members would have to have identical interests or perceived stakes; variations in interests are the reason why further refinement (i.e., Step 2) is part of a rigorous stakeholder analysis. Self-interest provides a natural reason to assume that individuals within a rolebased stakeholder group will employ a similar lens when perceiving their stakes, and thus be fairly homogenous with respect to their views on a particular issue. Presumably, so the thinking goes, employees will view their stakes in a particular issue through a lens of their selfinterest concerns with wages and job security; shareholders will view the stakes for the same issue through a lens of their own self-interest concerns with earnings and dividends; and so on. An important problem with what we call the “role primacy” approach to stakeholder analysis arises in situations in which self-interest does not constitute the primary motivator of individuals’ attitudes and priorities. In these instances it may well be that individuals or subgroups, each within different role-based stakeholder groups, have more similar priorities with respect to a particular issue than they have with others within their own role-based stakeholder group. In these situations the role primacy approach adds nothing to understanding our environment, and, in our opinion, actually impedes understanding. The basis for our position is that instead of creating a parsimonious and more cognitively efficient knowledge structure that classifies similar individuals into a single group, individuals with different priorities are classified within their respective (but uninformative) role-based stakeholder groups. Our second concern is related to insufficient rigor in the application of stakeholder analysis. Most stakeholder studies, both theoretical and empirical, fall short in executing the second step of stakeholder analysis: the determination of relevant interests and, when necessary, the subdivision of generic role-based stakeholder groups into rigorously defined specific stakeholder groups. As we present in some detail below, stakeholders are defined solely by role in essentially all of the literature. This is of great importance because stakeholder theory and management are used to postulate and create an alignment between organizational and stakeholder priorities. In order for an organization to align its priorities and actions with those of a stakeholder group, preferences concerning the organization must be relatively homogeneous within that stakeholder group. Otherwise, with what would the organization align its priorities and actions? Inherent in extant stakeholder research, therefore, is the implicit assumption of strong homogeneity of interests concerning an organization within stakeholder groups, and thus within roles. At the heart of both of our concerns is the issue of stakeholder group homogeneity.

Companies have begun to invest in cloud computing with the expectation that it will improve their business performances, operations, and processes. However, many companies are not so much aware of the cloud computing, so they can hesitate to adopt this new technology. The aims of the study are analyzing factors affecting the adoption of cloud computing and applying structural equation modeling technique to analyze the important dimensions of the adoption. Concordantly, previous studies are examined and expert interviews are arranged. Based on both our literature review and expert interviews, a model is proposed to measure the adoption of cloud computing. It is obvious that there are scarce researches about cloud computing adoption in the literature. Thus, the originality of the paper lies on that it proposes a research model for cloud computing adoption and it investigates various dimensions of cloud computing adoption in detail.	cloud computing	Ezgi Akar;Sona Mardiyan	2016	TIIS	10.3837/tiis.2016.01.002	cloud computing security;structural equation modeling;simulation;cloud computing;computer science;knowledge management;operating system;utility computing;world wide web;computer security;statistics	HCI	-74.95069408277818	0.8366309552821735	42156

Utilizing four operationalized search terms in the Web of Science; “happiness”, “subjective well-being”, “life satisfaction” and “positive affect”, a dataset was created for empirical citation analysis. Combined with qualitative interpretations of the publications, our results show how happiness studies has developed over time, in what journals the citing papers have been published, and which authors and researchers are the most productive within this set. We also trace various trends in happiness studies, such as the social indicators movement, the introduction of positive psychology and various medical and clinical applications of happiness studies. We conclude that “happiness studies” has emerged in many different disciplinary contexts and progressively been integrated and standardized. Moreover, beginning at the turn of the millennium, happiness studies has even begun to shape an autonomous field of inquiry, in which happiness becomes a key research problem for itself. Thus, rather than speaking of a distinct “happiness turn”, our study shows that there have been many heterogeneous turns to happiness, departing in a number of different disciplines.	autonomous robot;citation analysis;emergence;web of science;world wide web	Christopher Kullenberg;Gustaf Nelhans	2015	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-015-1536-3	social science;history of ideas;computer science;sociology;multidisciplinary approach;social psychology;citation analysis;world wide web	AI	-77.01361708500096	-19.470221767936888	42224

Borrowing from the literature on uses and gratifications theory, as well as media attendance theory and the concept of a technology cluster, the study investigated why people consume news differently on SNSs.The results show that each type of news activity may derive from different kinds of motivations, media habits and technology clusters. For example, the motivation of """"getting recognition"""" was found to be an important driving force for news posting, while it was not a significant predictor of news reading and news endorsing. On the other hand, the """"entertainment"""" motivation was revealed to be positively associated with news reading and news endorsing, while it was not with news posting.In addition, those who have an internet-based news repertoire were more likely to participate in news activities on SNSs and those who have many mobile devices were found to participate in news reading more frequently. The study was conducted using a national online survey. We investigated the predictors of three news activities on SNSs.News reading, posting, and endorsing derive from different motivations.Having an internet-based news repertoire was a positive predictor of news activities on SNSs.Having a large mobile-technology cluster was only positively associated with news reading."""

Despite this importance, surprisingly little research has measured the effectiveness of various requirements elicitation techniques. The present research first discusses theory relevant to information requirements determination in general and elicitation in particular.We then develop a model of the requirements elicitation process. This model and its underlying theory were then used to construct a new requirements elicitation prompting technique. To provide a context for testing the relative effectiveness of the new technique, two other questioning methodologies were also operationalized as prompting techniques: (1) the interrogatories technique, which involves asking who, what, when, where, how, and why questions; and (2) a semantic questioning scheme, which involves asking questions based on a theoretical model of knowledge structures. To measure the usefulness of the prompting techniques in eliciting requirements, a set of generic requirements categories was adapted from previous research to capture requirements evoked by users. The effectiveness of the three methods in eliciting requirements for a software application was then tested in an experiment with users. Results showed that the new prompting technique elicited a greater quantity of requirements from users than did the other two techniques. Implications of the findings for research and systems analysis practice are discussed.	requirement;requirements elicitation	Glenn J. Browne;Michael B.

Knowledge transferors share different types of knowledge with the recipients with a view to fulfilling the latter’s knowledge needs. The importance of identifying the appropriate knowledge transfer mechanisms and the barriers to knowledge transfer are paramount. However, neither the knowledge management literature nor the NGO-sector literature has adequately addressed the issues of causes of knowledge transfer, taxonomies of knowledge, mechanisms and barriers of knowledge transfer in comprehensive way in the context of the Bangladeshi NGO sector. The highest number of NGOs in the world is deployed in Bangladesh. Little is known about such transfer within the NGO context based in Bangladesh. This paper makes an endeavour to bridge these grey areas of knowledge management and NGO-sector. Having collected the qualitative data from Bangladeshi NGOs and using the content analysis technique, the study identified the causes of knowledge transfer, taxonomies of knowledge, mechanisms of knowledge transfer and the barriers to knowledge transfer in the context of Bangladesh. By understanding the mechanisms and the determinants of knowledge transfer, company and NGO managers and public policy makers can influence knowledge transfer more effectively. Future researchers may extend this study by carrying out similar research in a different context.

The concept of social networks is vital in helping the users to manage their work cycle and adaptation of information technology evolutions. It has an open platform to the where the researchers can apply classical technique from social network to online networking; and also influence it to semantic representation. The Google trend depicts the data of social networking as 93% usage of social networking. A survey study is undertaken that interprets the use of different social networking for the youth of Delhi in India. It also depict the data of the usage of information retrieval with social networking is very low.

In the process of changing, companies need to be adaptive and innovative. Therefore, a company needs to cultivate and maintain its knowledge. Among other ways, it can be achieved by encouraging the process of knowledge sharing within the company. Hence, this study aims to know the perception of the employee regarding knowledge sharing. An assessment of employee perceptions toward knowledge sharing was conducted by using questionnaires for employees in three consulting companies in Indonesia, namely Pusilkom UI, Altrovis and Usmart. This study concludes that the factors that encourage knowledge sharing are the intrinsic factors rather than the extrinsic factors. Organization can drive the success of knowledge sharing by providing supporting facilities.	user interface	Achmad Nizar Hidayanto;Ika Chandra Hapsari;Ika Alfina;Yudho Giri Sucahyo	2013	JCP	10.4304/jcp.8.10.2719-2723	knowledge management;management science;knowledge;knowledge value chain;perception	HCI	-81.18175881447205	-0.015664718553644576	42406

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the following issue: how can social mechanisms be examined from a systemic point of view? Design/methodology/approach – The paper investigates, at an abstract level, what is meant by social mechanisms in social systems in Part 1. Social mechanisms and various explanation models are investigated in Part 2, using the systemic approach. Findings – However well-functioning the models developed, this procedure will not have developed a theory of the phenomenon. For that purpose, explanations at a more basic level than the model is able to disclose, will be necessary. The empirical causal model says something about the strength in the relation between the variables and can be used in practice in order to change certain variables to facilitate the desired change in the system. Originality/value – The paper usefully shows that, if possible, explanations at a more basic level would be desirable; but not necessary for the application of insights in practical contexts. By this, the paper has stated that a theory can be desirable, but not necessary, in order to develop, e.g. innovative organisations. Models and social mechanisms, on the other hand, are necessary to organise knowledge for the purpose of use in practical contexts.	causal filter;causal model;email;function model;social engineering (security);social reality;social system;theory	Jon-Arild Johannessen	2010	Kybernetes	10.1108/03684921011036763	cybernetics;computer science;artificial intelligence;social system;mathematics;management science;systems thinking	AI	-78.51222101818777	-2.6160290647034	42458

fbb7bb94aeeeb3c1cad62f5cb0878a57ca3d569c	« human agency », erp and crm: the roles of final users in the postimplementation phase	selected works;bepress	Many studies on information systems (IS) place greater emphasis on the concept of users than on structures to explain the impact of information technologies (IT) in organizations [Boudreau & Robey 2005, Cousins and Robey, 2005; Chu & Robey, 2008]. Human agency offers a theoretical framework for greater insights into the use of new technologies like Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) or Customer Relationship Management (CRM) in relation to three temporal dimensions: the iterations of the past, future forecasts and the contingencies of the present. We apply this theory to two case studies. The first is an exploratory study that focuses on the implementation of a CRM tool in a large French telecommunications company, and the second is a confirmatory study of an ERP software system, following its introduction in a large state-owned organization in France (RTE). The findings from these two cases illustrate the value of the theory of human agency 1 to explain the way CRM and ERP use evolves. End users continued to work in the old way, deliberately choosing not to use these tools whenever possible, then improvised uses in response to urgent demands, and finally reinvented uses in accordance with their own interpretations of future needs, stages described by Boudreau and Robey as inertia and reinvention (2005).	americas conference on information systems;attitudinal analytics;complementarity theory;context switch;customer relationship management;erp;enterprise resource planning;information system;interaction;iteration;organizational behavior;relevance;software system	Wilfrid Azan	2011			public relations;operations management;business;management	HCI	-82.72182529665328	1.9984780507972502	42664

This paper introduces two new approaches, the scale balance model and the trust spider diagram, to help model and investigate individual trust development over time. A 2 year longitudinal case study is used to investigate individual trust development based on a yearlong student project. 16 student groups participated in the computer mediated collaboration. Survey data were collected at three points throughout the project year and the results are analyzed using the two approaches. Interviews were also conducted at the end of the project. In this research, interesting findings, such as some dynamic features, are revealed by using the methods. Each approach to analyzing individual trust development has its strengths and weaknesses, and using the two together has the benefit of mitigating some weaknesses and combining the strengths. Analyzing trust development over time contributes to enhance computer mediated collaboration in both theoretical research and practical application.		Xusen Cheng;Linda A.

By integrating social cognitive theory (SCT) model and IS success model theory, this research identified and analysed three dimensions of influential factors of knowledge sharing behaviour, namely individual factors, technological factors and contextual factors. Data were collected from virtual community members of information technology in Indonesia and subsequently analysed by using partial least squares (PLS) method. The result showed that the information quality, the norm of reciprocity, the expectation outcomes, the enjoyment in helping others and the interpersonal trust have significant influence in knowledge sharing behaviour. In addition, the result also concluded that knowledge contributing behaviour and knowledge utilisation are particularly important for community promotion activities.	information quality;information systems success model;partial least squares regression;virtual community;zero-knowledge proof	Achmad Nizar Hidayanto;Arieffender Limupa;Kasiyah M.

Eight subsets of DSS research are identified; they are foundations, group DSS, routing DSS, data base management systems, multiple criteria DSS, marketing DSS, multiple criteria decision making, and management science. Earlier studies by Culnan reported that management information systems (MIS) have made significant progress toward a cumulative research tradition. This study extends the study of Culnan and examines a subspecialty of eight areas of MIS research identified by prior research. Contrary to the prior research, this research supports the theory of continuing fragmentation of DSS research and finds very little cumulative research tradition. Further, this study suggests that DSS research should be directed toward the improvement of organizational decision making.	database;decision support system;factor analysis;fragmentation (computing);management information system;management science;multidimensional scaling;routing	Sean B.

This study also explains that the user’s experience with a smartphone can encourage portal users to expect that the mobile portal services are useful and that the experience can link brand equity in certain business environments to trust in the brand in other business environments. Site quality including the design quality of portal sites can affect the user’s trust in the mobile services of the portal sites directly and can affect the user’s intention to use the mobile portal services under certain conditions. Practically, this study suggests that portal sites should focus on designing and developing more usable sites with high-quality UI components—convenient menu navigation, a proper UI design, and usable content rather depend on their current position as the leading companies in the wired Internet environment.	portals;smartphone	Jongtae Lee;Myeong-Cheol Park	2013	Inf.

Through the use of case study methodology, the paper finds a confluence of contextual factors fostering changes in an IT management strategy aimed at increasing efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery and improving customer/citizen satisfaction. These factors include changes in the regulatory policy environment, advances in technology, increasing citizen and customer knowledge and sophistication about IT, and managerial and elected official commitment to an IT strategy. The paper begins by proposing a model of the IT strategic planning process that occurs in municipal environments and then details several IT initiatives of the municipality in relation to the proposed model. The study finds that the complex nature of technology and its financial risk due to quick obsolescence poses political risks for the organization attempting to manage the IT infrastructure, which changes at a far faster pace than the organization's other types of infrastructure. The strategic management of IT must take into account the differing value sets among its organizational and political members and how these differing motivations impact the management of the IT infrastructure.	confluence;customer knowledge;itil;risk management;strategic management	Keith Schildt;Suzanne Beaumaster	2004	37th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2004.

New developments in multidimensional scaling (MDS) enable us not only to visualize these patterns at each moment of time, but also to animate them over time. Using title words, coauthors, and journal names in Garfield’s oeuvre, the method is demonstrated and further developed in this paper (and in the animation at http://www.leydesdorff.net/garfield/animation).

However, prior research has overlooked the boundary conditions under which trust can be transferred. Understanding of the general institutional mechanisms is necessary to ensure the trust environment underlying e-commerce. The present study identifies two key moderators that affect the relationships between trust-in-platform, trust-in-seller, and purchase intention in consumer to consumer (C2C) online shopping contexts: perceived effectiveness of e-commerce institutional mechanisms (PEEIM) and perceived website quality of the seller (PWQS). Using a sample of 294 online buyers from TaoBao (a major Chinese C2C portal), we find that trust-in-platform positively affects trust-in-seller; meanwhile, trust-in-seller positively influences purchase intention. In addition, PEEIM negatively moderates the relationship between trust-in-platform and trust...		Xiayu Chen;Qian Huang;Robert M. Davison	2015	Int. J.

Many of these emigrants are mothers who often have children left behind. Family separation is now recognized as one of the social costs of migration affecting the global south. Relationships within such transnational families depend on long-­‐distance communication and there is an increasing optimism among Filipino government agencies and telecommunications companies about the consequences of mobile phones for transnational families. This article draws on comparative research with UK-­‐based Filipina migrants – mainly domestic workers and nurses – and their left-­‐behind children in the Philippines. Our methodology allowed us to directly compare the experience of mothers and their children. The article concludes that while mothers feel empowered that the phone has allowed them to partially reconstruct their role as parents, their children are significantly more ambivalent about the consequences of transnational communication.	mobile phone	Mirca Madianou;Daniel Miller	2011	New Media & Society	10.1177/1461444810393903	gender studies;sociology;ethnography;social psychology;technology	HCI	-79.06079220838153	-13.165423804160769	43263

The letters “VIM”, as suggested by Professor Max Goldstein of NYU, were originally meant to represent 6000 in Pseudo-Roman numerals. To qualify for membership, an organization must have installed or on order a CDC 6000, 7000, CYBER 70 or CYBER 170 series computer. VIM INC presently consists of 249 member organizations that represent a variety of government agencies, research and educational institutions as well as private industry. The membership is also diverse with respect to national origin, with 52% of the membership in the United States and major concentrations in Western Europe, Canada and Australia. As a result, the main thrust of VIM activity is directed to areas of interest common to the entire membership.  The principal objectives of the organization as stated in the VIM Bylaws are “to foster the development, free exchange and communication of research pertaining to VIM computers in the best scientific tradition and to provide a means of communication with the Manufacturer of VIM Computers”.	cdc 6000 series;cdc cyber;computer;thrust;vim	F.

Our concern is that most transition models are too static. Although they capture a move of focus from static equilibria to transitions between dynamic equilibria, they are still rooted in an “equilibriumist” approach. Improvement is possible with agent-based models that give attention to endogenous system processes called “transformation processes”. These models can render far more dynamic pictures of societal systems in transition, and are no longer remote from descriptions in the emerging transition literature.	agent-based model;social system	Michel Schilperoord;Jan Rotmans;Noam Bergman	2008	Computational & Mathematical Organization Theory	10.1007/s10588-008-9036-0	simulation;knowledge management;management science	AI	-74.87612605713944	0.18837195819538166	43314

Articles that have been cited at least 50 times were assessed regarding publication outputs, distribution of outputs in journals, publications of authors, institutions, countries as well as citation life cycles of articles with the highest total citations since its publication up to 2011 and the highest citations in 2011. Five bibliometric indicators were used to evaluate source countries, institutions, and authors. Results showed that 721 of the most highly referenced articles, published between 1957 and 2008, had been cited at least 50 times. Child Abuse & Neglect and American Journal of Community Psychology published the most classic articles. USA produced 89 % of classic articles and also published the most number of single, internationally collaborative, first author, and corresponding author classic articles. The top 38 productive institutions were all located in the US. The University of Illinois was the most productive institution for the total classic articles while University of California, Los Angeles produced the most inter-institutionally collaborative articles and Arizona State University published the most single institution articles. Furthermore, a new indicator, Y-index was successfully applied to evaluate publication characteristics of authors and institutions. High percentage of authors had the same numbers of first author and corresponding author status of classic articles in social work field.	bibliometrics;social sciences citation index;web of science;world wide web	Yuh-Shan Ho	2013	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-013-1014-8	social science;social work;media studies	Web+IR	-77.21645552277135	-21.24502347429337	43328

MAIPLE has explored the ways in which public library services manage use of the internet connections that they provide for the public. This included the how public library services balance their legal obligations and the needs of their communities in a public space and the ethical dilemmas that arise. Design/methodology/approach – The researchers used a mixed-method approach involving a review of the literature, legal analysis, a questionnaire survey and case studies in five public library authorities. Findings – UK public library services use a range of methods to regulate internet access. The research also confirms previous findings that filtering software is an ubiquitous tool for controlling access to and protecting library users from “inappropriate”, illegal and harmful internet content. There is a general, if sometimes reluctant, acceptance of filtering software as a practical tool by library staff, which seems to contrast with professional codes of ethics and attitudes in other countries. The research indicates that public library internet access will be a valued service for some time to come, but that some aspects of how public library services regulate internet access is currently managed can have socially undesirable consequences, including blocking legitimate sites and preventing users from accessing government services.

Although organizations recognize that ISSDB poses a serious problem, understanding what motivates its occurrence continues to be a key concern. While studies on information technology (IT) misuse abounds, research specifically focusing on the drivers of ISSDB remains scant in the literature. Using self-control theory, augmented with knowledge of relevant factors, this study examined the effects of employees' self-control, knowledge of computers/IT, and information systems (IS) security threats and risks on participation in ISSDB. A research model, including the aforementioned factors, was proposed and tested using the partial least squares technique. Data was collected from a survey of Canadian professionals. The results show that low self-control and lower levels of knowledge of computers/IT are related to employees' involvement in ISSDB. The data did not provide a meaningful relationship between employees' knowledge of IS security threats/risks and desire to participate in ISSDB.	computer;control theory;email;information systems;information security;information system;internet;misuse case;partial least squares regression	Princely Ifinedo	2017		10.1145/3084381.3084384	wireless network;information system;the internet;self-control;information technology;business;public relations;knowledge management;deviance (sociology)	AI	-85.26137790951931	-7.60142257404171	43360

Managing performance of organizations using management control system or performance management systems is essential for managers. As organizations are increasingly having to expand globally, they are forced to operate their original PMSs, but in different cultures. While, the impact of culture on PMS implementation have been revisited in the performance management literature from organizational perspectives, the impact of national culture on PMS was not clearly explored. Therefore the aim of the authors is to explore the impact of national culture on the lifecycle of PMS. Qualitative inductive research approach, and semi structured interviews of indigenous SMEs’ were employed, and the findings suggest that national culture impact PMSs life-cycle and propositions are provided explaining the expected behaviour of different national cultures.

Interviews, or other types of face-to-face communication, are one of theways of doing it but problemsmight arise if we deal with tacit knowledge and if the interviewer and the interviewee come from a very different cultural and educational background. This research proposes a visualization approach to be used in the interaction between domain and modeling experts that will facilitate communication in these kinds of situations. The approach is based on the findings of knowledge visualization and related fields, as well as on a firm understanding of ABMs. Three important aspects of ABMs that need to be visualized in order to facilitate understandingwere identified. In a case study, performed in relation to a projectwhere a spatial ABMwas developed, three node-link diagrams were created according to the developed approach. They visualize the conceptual structure, the simulation process, and the datamodel of the ABM. These diagramswere positively received by the stakeholders of the project and they improved workflow and communication in the project. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Participants were presented with information concerning two tweets and asked which they would prefer to read. Analysis of the results shows that recognition of the author as being within the readers local network is highly influential in the decision to read a tweet. This has analogies with results from cognitive psychology on decision making processes such as the recognition heuristic. The role of more detailed quantitative metadata has also been assessed. Surprisingly, metadata describing the popularity of tweet authors in terms of the number of followers or the number of tweets written has no significant impact on decision making, while metadata describing the tweet content (the number of retweets) has a significant impact, with a large proportion of users preferring to read content that has been retweeted a larger number of times. When friendship information and quantitative values are combined the impact of the friendship information is reduced, but a larger proportion of users still prefer to choose based on this information, while the impact of the retweet value is reduced.	heuristic;tweeter;web application	Matthew J.

dcae2e0c54531078d225091e0b198271bdb6cf47	neuroinformatics: opportunities across disciplinary and national borders		Brain and behavioral research has exploded in the past 2 decades because of the conceptual links that were made across different species, levels of biological organization, and methodological approaches and links that were made internationally. This progress has increased our understanding of how the nervous system orchestrates behavior in illness and in health and has produced many novel approaches to treating such illness and maintaining health. This explosion of information has also brought increased specialization, which allows scientists to keep up with the research that is most relevant to their own. The cost of such specialization, however, is a decrease in the ability of researchers to relate their findings to different species, levels, approaches, and findings from other laboratories. Thus, an overload of information is threatening the very fuel that has driven brain and behavioral research to the forefront of science. Data obtained in brain and behavioral research are very diverse. This diversity derives from the wide range of species studied, from invertebrates to humans, as well as from the spectrum of levels of biological organizations studied, including molecules, cells, systems of cells, behavior, and all levels in between. Additional variety in the data pool is introduced by the many different methodologies used and by the interest of brain and behavioral research in understanding both normal and diseased states throughout the entire life span. Data obtained in brain and behavioral research are also vast, being generated by tens of thousands of researchers working around the world, and being reported in hundreds of journals. Finally, data obtained in brain and behavioral research are complex and highly interconnected, with innumerable interactions among the different aspects studied. For example, findings at the molecular level might have important implications for interpretation of behavioral data. This information-rich domain is perfectly poised to take advantage of the technological advances in digital information and telecommunications technologies and the rapidly expanding scientific opportunities of informatics, to which information science, computer science, applied mathematics, statistics, and engineering contribute. These tools and approaches have the potential of harnessing the flood of data and facilitating links across various subdisciplines of neuroscience and around the world. The promise that such informatics approaches hold for allowing brain and behavioral scientists to make better use of their data was recognized by the National Academy of Science’s Institute of Medicine, which published a report in 1991 (Martin and Pechura, 1991). That report strongly endorsed the implementation of what has since been named the Human Brain Project. The Human Brain Project supports neuroinformatics research, which knits together the rapidly advancing fields of neuroscience and informatics, to study and develop advanced information tools and approaches to help brain and behavioral scientists make better sense and use of their data. This ongoing research initiative is led by the National Institute of Mental Health and supported by a total of 16 federal research funding organizations across five agencies.1	academy;biological organisation;digital data;human brain project;illness (finding);informatics (discipline);information science;interaction;invertebrates;journal;laboratory;microsoft forefront;name;nervous system structure;neuroinformatics;neuroscience discipline;partial template specialization;rem sleep behavior disorder;scientific publication;span distance;transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation;computer science	Michael F.

Broad-based information is needed to integrate across domains to address sustainability problems cast as complex systems problems that vary widely across space and time. Deep-based information is needed to address nuanced and contextual relationships that exist within and across domains. Both broad and deep information together are needed to better address spatial–temporal dynamics in complex sustainable systems.

5887faf17893838262e5afdf0a29e7afe968f48b	an exploration of public reaction to the opm data breach notifications		With the number of data breaches swelling, people are likely to not respond adequately and ignore the breach notifications altogether. Ignorance of breach notifications creates a perfect storm of cyclical outrage and apathy that criminals can use to their advantage. In this research-in-progress paper, we explore public reactions to breach notifications for addressing two research questions: (1) with more and more information related to the breach, do people become apathetic towards that breach? (2) at what point do people simply tune out information related to the breach? The results of the sentiment analysis show that public express anxiety when there is a fear of being affected by the breach, and public express anger when there are lack of measures to safeguard the data. Sadness is the most strongly expressed emotion in response to the severity of the breach. After the public has received sufficient details about the event, they start to tune out information related to the breach event.	data breach	Rohit Valecha;Eric Bachura;Rui Chen;H.

Drawing on the expectancy violations (EV) theory and the cognitive dissonance perspectives, this study opens the door to reconciling contradicting research findings in literature and provides clues to why and when a good reputation yields buffering or boomerang effects in bad times.	boomerang;extended validation certificate;hemlock (editor);single-loss expectancy	Yj Sohn;Ruthann Weaver Lariscy	2015	Communication Research	10.1177/0093650212466891	psychology;advertising;cognitive dissonance;social psychology	HCI	-89.12327591119637	-17.065355562574773	43600

Do these approaches lead to field-normalized impact measures for journals? In addition to the 2-year IF (IF2), we consider the 5-year IF (IF5), the respective numerators of these IFs, and the number of Total Cites, counted both as integers and fractionally. These various indicators are tested against the hypothesis that the classification of journals into 11 broad fields by PatentBoard/NSF (National Science Foundation) provides statistically significant between-field effects. Using fractional counting the between-field variance is reduced by 91.7% in the case of IF5, and by 79.2% in the case of IF2. However, the differences in citation counts are not significantly affected by fractional counting. These results accord with previous studies, but the longer citation window of a fractionally counted IF5 can lead to significant improvement in the normalization across fields.	cd-rom;citation index;emoticon;ibm notes	Loet Leydesdorff;Ping Zhou;Lutz Bornmann	2013	JASIST	10.1002/asi.22765	information science;computer science;data mining;statistics	NLP	-77.8914516809002	-21.550128470006634	43634

With the number of ACL submissions steadily growing over the last several years (for example, ACL 2009 had a 24% increase in submissions over ACL 2008), the need for more reviewers has become more pronounced. However, qualified reviewers are becoming hard to find, and when they are found, they are often hard-pressed for time. As a result, slipshod reviews are becoming commonplace. Allowing this situation to continue as before will result in the deterioration of our ability to recognize excellence in our research. An ‘intervention’ is therefore needed. As I see it, there are two distinct problems to tackle: first, a lack of qualified reviewers, and second, a lack of quality control in reviews. After discussing these, I will suggest some solutions that I believe are worth implementing.	computation;computational linguistics;failure	Inderjeet Mani	2011	Computational Linguistics	10.1162/coli_a_00046	natural language processing;artificial intelligence;management science;excellence;computer science	NLP	-66.87150051796273	-23.363059719423692	43659

Design/methodology/approach – The authors test a set of hypotheses about the influence that the constructs have on overall satisfaction. Also tested are a set of hypotheses about the satisfaction influence on post-purchase behaviour. Findings – The paper argues that product information quality and user interface quality have a significant impact on overall satisfaction, while service information quality, purchasing process, security perception and product attractiveness have only a positive impact. In addition, the findings reveal that customer satisfaction strongly affects post-purchase behaviour. Research limitations/implications – The limited Greek respondent “tank” in combination with low internet and technology infusion in Greece, as well as the limited online market in Greece, are the study’s main limitations. Common method bias through the use of Likert scales is also considered an important limitation. Practical implications – The findings indicate some important determinants of customer satisfaction and present a satisfaction index, the score of which is a valid and objective measurement of e-commerce success. Originality/value – This paper offers e-commerce practitioners an objective standard to measure quantitatively the success of a web store as well as a wide frame of reference for researchers to extend e-commerce research.	customer relationship management;e-commerce;information quality;internet;online shopping;purchasing;user interface	Dimitrios I.

The price for mobile services is the most important determinant in the way low-income households use mobile phones. Based on existing data on mobile communication prices, a global index for measuring the price of mobile communication with 2G handsets has been developed. This index allows the comparison of price levels in different countries. The first step involves defining a mobile communication basket, containing a specific amount of speech and short messaging per month. The definition of this basket is based on the OECD definition of a standard basket of monthly mobile communication consumption (OECD, 2010) and targets the consumption habits of low income users. Two different indices are proposed. A first calculation from the years 2009 to 2012 involving the indices of 149 countries provides a useful overview of the global mobile price landscape.	mobile phone	Walter Dettling;Anna Hitz	2016	Telematics and Informatics	10.1016/j.tele.2015.07.003	economics;telecommunications;marketing;advertising;economy;commerce	Theory	-82.94520221450253	-9.903505806676252	43710

Although the Web has provided a variety of e-health sites, these sites have offered little in the way of enabling the human resources (HR) function. This article examines health care consumers’ views of an existing health maintenance selection process. Data are gathered from employees of a southeastern university that offers a myriad of health maintenance organization (HMO) services. The findings suggest that HR–enabled health care Web portals must include consumer-defined features such as rank-ordered preferences by employees, privacy/security functions, and electronic enrollment during the HMO selection process. Despite these results, participants in the survey did not advocate the elimination of human interaction in this effort, instead supporting the concept of businessto-employee commerce.	business-to-employee;e-commerce;information;portals;real-time data;real-time transcription;world wide web	Fay Cobb Payton	2003	J.

This agenda mandates a ”think small first” principle in order to enable e-invoicing for companies of any size. The electronic invoice should be exchanged between the ERP systems of business partners. Traditional approaches based on electronic data interchange failed to attract SMEs. Due to the high costs, they only use e-invoicing if forced by their larger business partners. In this paper, we present an alternative approach that is based on native ERP integration of most common e-invoice scenarios. This approach was successfully implemented in a research project resulting in a university spin-off.	e-procurement;erp;electronic data interchange;enterprise resource planning;procurement	Christian Huemer;Marco Zapletal;Philipp Liegl	2013		10.1007/978-3-319-07055-1_2	invoice;process management;enterprise resource planning;e-procurement;electronic data interchange;business	HCI	-74.23917594091863	4.1219307530345395	43790

The Plan addresses a situation in which Catalan is stable demolinguistically but in which globalization and international immigration are seen as long-term threats to the language's vitality. In addition, language planners were and remain concerned with preserving social cohesion in a much more linguistically and culturally diverse society.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#We show that this policy builds on and maintains the infrastructure of the prior Normalization policy discussed in Part 1. Nevertheless, it presents a late modern ethos in favor of societal multilingualism that transcends the position in favor of bilingualism aimed for by Normalization. We argue that research on Catalonian society's response to this policy shows some difficulties with implementation and a continuing preoccupation with traditional essentialist ethnolinguistic concerns by some Catalonians. However, we also find that this late modern ethos of multilingualism is assumed by large segments of Catalan society as a representing forward-looking desirable cosmopolitan identity. The article ends with an overview of how recent political developments in relation to Catalonia's political status are linked to language policy and use.

In Partially distributed teams, some members are collocated while others are geographically distant. In-Group / Out-Group Dynamics often occur in such teams, when co-located members treat one another as a preferential ‘Us’ vs. treating distant members as the outsider ‘Them’. This paper presents a pilot study with 30 professionals, of factors contributing to reduction of such ‘Us-vs.-Them’ and to an increase in team effectiveness. The study examines partially distributed team challenges, as reported by participants, and relates them to Us-vs.-Them susceptibility. The pilot study also gives an insight into the negative impact that ‘Us-vs.-Them’ has on effectiveness. Lastly, it investigates policies that exist in partially distributed teams and their impact on both Us-vs.-them and effectiveness. Findings suggest that the concerns of partially distributed team members can lead to Us-vs.-Them occurrences and that there is a correlation between these occurrences and effectiveness (as Us-vs.-Them increases, effectiveness decreases). There is also evidence in the results that policy establishment is beneficial for partially distributed teams.	the outsider	Robin Privman;Starr Roxanne Hiltz	2009			simulation;knowledge management	HCI	-87.01280354490935	-0.9239970254979927	43937

43fee3f101d45cff09edf7d4896a625fa8e2da7f	the persuasive phish: examining the social psychological principles hidden in phishing emails	phishing;email;social engineering;persuasion;security	Phishing is a social engineering tactic used to trick people into revealing personal information [Zielinska, Tembe, Hong, Ge, Murphy-Hill, & Mayhorn 2014]. As phishing emails continue to infiltrate users' mailboxes, what social engineering techniques are the phishers using to successfully persuade victims into releasing sensitive information?  Cialdini's [2007] six principles of persuasion (authority, social proof, liking/similarity, commitment/consistency, scarcity, and reciprocation) have been linked to elements of phishing emails [Akbar 2014; Ferreira, & Lenzini 2015]; however, the findings have been conflicting. Authority and scarcity were found as the most common persuasion principles in 207 emails obtained from a Netherlands database [Akbar 2014], while liking/similarity was the most common principle in 52 personal emails available in Luxemborg and England [Ferreira et al. 2015]. The purpose of this study was to examine the persuasion principles present in emails available in the United States over a period of five years.  Two reviewers assessed eight hundred eighty-seven phishing emails from Arizona State University, Brown University, and Cornell University for Cialdini's six principles of persuasion. Each email was evaluated using a questionnaire adapted from the Ferreira et al. [2015] study. There was an average agreement of 87% per item between the two raters.  Spearman's Rho correlations were used to compare email characteristics over time. During the five year period under consideration (2010--2015), the persuasion principles of commitment/consistency and scarcity have increased over time, while the principles of reciprocation and social proof have decreased over time. Authority and liking/similarity revealed mixed results with certain characteristics increasing and others decreasing.  The commitment/consistency principle could be seen in the increase of emails referring to elements outside the email to look more reliable, such as Google Docs or Adobe Reader (rs(850) = .12, p =.001), while the scarcity principle could be seen in urgent elements that could encourage users to act quickly and may have had success in eliciting a response from users (rs(850) = .09, p =.01). Reciprocation elements, such as a requested reply, decreased over time (rs(850) = -.12, p =.001). Additionally, the social proof principle present in emails by referring to actions performed by other users also decreased (rs(850) = -.10, p =.01).  Two persuasion principles exhibited both an increase and decrease in their presence in emails over time: authority and liking/similarity. These principles could increase phishing rate success if used appropriately, but could also raise suspicions in users and decrease compliance if used incorrectly. Specifically, the source of the email, which corresponds to the authority principle, displayed an increase over time in educational institutes (rs(850) = .21, p <.001), but a decrease in financial institutions (rs(850) = -.18, p <.001). Similarly, the liking/similarity principle revealed an increase over time of logos present in emails (rs(850) = .18, p <.001) and decrease in service details, such as payment information (rs(850) = -.16, p <.001).  The results from this study offer a different perspective regarding phishing. Previous research has focused on the user aspect; however, few studies have examined the phisher perspective and the social psychological techniques they are implementing. Additionally, they have yet to look at the success of the social psychology techniques. Results from this study can be used to help to predict future trends and inform training programs, as well as machine learning programs used to identify phishing messages.	docs (software);email;google forms;information sensitivity;machine learning;norm (social);personally identifiable information;phishing;social engineering (security);social proof;word lists by frequency	Olga A.

A model is proposed and tested using aggregate customer data and store performance outcomes from a group of stores owned by a national retail organization. Results suggest that both service and merchandise quality exert significant influence on store performance, measured by sales growth and customer growth, and their impact is mediated by customer satisfaction. Implications of the results and future research directions are discussed.		Emin Babakus;Carol C. Bienstock;James R.

0d269760d8f9379e034a2e8969aed9c3659f3997	privacy and the digital generation gap: myth and reality		Over the past decade the demise of privacy has been repeatedly pronounced by renowned technology executives such as Mark Zuckerberg declaring privacy as passé and anachronistic“so 20th century” the concern of old people. However, there has been relatively little research into privacy perception and behaviour among different generations that may relate to how people navigate their private lives in online settings. Furthermore, recent research reveals the ways in which privacy concerns of young internet users are enacted, thus challenging overgeneralized claims of a clear-cut generation gap associated with online privacy. As information privacy problems are becoming thornier, unfounded statement voiced by stakeholders with vested interests should be put to one side. Instead, systematic research is needed to understand how privacy is perceived and managed by people of different age groups, and what measures can and should be taken to address current and future concerns of internet users across generations. We address these questions and account for the results using a representative sample from Israel.	information privacy;internet privacy	Ruth Halperin;Yuval Dror	2015			mythology;self-disclosure;generation gap;public relations;internet privacy;political science;digital native	HCI	-80.38144414130761	-14.637882550584619	44005

The sample includes more than 15,000 posts from Fortune 500 companies' Facebook accounts in a five-year time frame. Three communication strategies are examined, including appeal, vividness, and interactivity. Results confirm the main effects of vividness and emotional appeals. However, interactivity does not help generate more eWOM behavior. Proposed interactions between vividness and appeal type, as well as between vividness and interactivity, are significant. Emotional appeals amplify the beneficial effects of vividness, whereas interactivity dampens the potency of vividness.	social media marketing	Jiangmeng Liu;Cong Li;Yi Grace Ji;Michael North;Fan Yang	2017	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2017.03.068	psychology;social media;computer science;multimedia;interactivity;social psychology;world wide web	HCI	-87.13704970338834	-14.152035598655567	44034

This paper describes how a GSS was used to support a process improvement project in a Hong Kong accounting firm. Although the project encountered many difficulties, the application of action research facilitated the adaptation of the GSS to the shifting circumstances and the project was successfully completed. A variety of lessons concerning the use of GSS are presented while increased use of action research in complex organisational contexts is recommended.		Robert Vogel;Doug Davison	2000	Inf. Syst.

Logically, a more information-centred environment should be more conducive to information science and to information scientists taking part in other types of research. In this article it is argued that information scientists can play a valuable role by evaluating new information sources in a meta-disciplinary context, developing tools and methods to analyse the data and, crucially, contributing to the prediction of the kinds of research questions that the data may usefully help address. It is argued that this is both an essential service for social science research and one that information science is uniquely placed to provide. A timely response to this challenge may also generate novel research problems within information science itself.	blog;computer science;e-social science;fuzzy logic;information science;world wide web	Mike Thelwall;Paul Wouters	2005		10.1007/11495222_15	input/output;information needs;the internet;information science;computer science;metadata;world wide web;information system	HPC	-72.64448594205922	-21.22882765956876	44123

Theoretical role models and interpretations as well as several commercial products are for instance based on the role concept and use them as their underlying access control paradigm. A conducted scientific literature collection revealed 866 publications dealing with roles in the context of Information Security. Although there is an ANSI/NIST standard and an ISO standard proposal there are a variety of competing models and application scenarios available and based on their different concepts and interpretations there is lack of consensus and clarity. Additionally, in practice several interpretations of the role concept have developed, dealing with the usage of theoretical findings on roles to improve existing security technologies. Because of the current situation there is need for a comprehensive article surveying the different proposals and streams of research on roles in Information Security. The goal and major contribution of this survey are a categorization of existing research into different classes following a three-level classification methodology. Based on a well-defined methodology a general categorization of the complete underlying set of publications, including general statistical data is provided. The main part of the work is investigating 30 identified research directions, evaluating their importance, and analyzing research tendencies and trends. An electronic bibliography including all surveyed publications together with the classification information is provided additionally. As a final contribution of the paper future trends in the area of role -research based on the data collected and own personal interpretations are predicted.	categorization;information security;programming paradigm;role-based access control;scientific literature	Ludwig Fuchs;Günther Pernul;Ravi S.

For 50 years he has viewed all people, things, and ideas in dynamic relationships. That perspective is a network perspective and at the same time anthropological, combining ethnographic, historical, holistic, and comparative views. It is valuable and beneficial to the community of scholars who use network analysis to try to understand what is going on, what went on before, and what the future prospects are. As an anthropologist, his interest is more in the wholes generated by network linkages—systems of households, bands, lineages, communities, corporations, governments—than in the individual persons linked. Even now, when personal network “communities” are getting so much attention network analysis can clarify the more complex wholes such as multinational corporations and supranational systems. Those important entities and the problems they represent should not be left to economists and politicians. Concepts considered include system evolution and increasing complexity; anthropological views of transactions, relations, modes of transactions, spheres of transactions in multicentric economies, complexity across the full range of embedded networks—material, biological, and sociocultural. Social network analysis can help to define systems at various levels of integration, both within communities and in the widest conceivable supranational level. Techniques such as regular equivalence and block-modeling are useful in sorting the subsystems of complex systems. He concludes with hope that as improved methods of data mining and network analysis are developed, other anthropologists and social scientists will be able to measure the evolution of supranational sociocultural systems that involve both states and multinational corporations.	complex systems;data mining;embedded system;entity;holism;network theory;personal network;social network analysis;sociocultural system;sorting;turing completeness;weighted network	Alvin W.

Many organisations have experienced negative impacts from e-mail and have responded by electronically monitoring and restricting e-mail system use. However, electronic monitoring of e mail can be contentious. Staff can react to these controls by dissent, protest and potentially transformative action. This article presents the results of a single case study investigation of staff reactions to electronic monitoring and control of an e-mail system in a company based in Ireland. The findings highlight the variations in staff reactions through multiple time frames of electronic monitoring and control, and identifies the key concerns of staff which need to be addressed by management and consultants advocating the implementation of e-mail system monitoring and control.	exploratory testing	Aidan Maurice Duane;Patrick Finnegan	2007	IRMJ	10.4018/irmj.2007010101	public relations;engineering;knowledge management;marketing;operations management;management;law;information technology;computer security;exploratory research;scientific control	Robotics	-83.33393279430369	-1.1024430081490968	44195

For instance, the access to learning material, conduction of commercial activities, promotion of agricultural activities, enhancement of governmental transparency, support of healthcare practices, etc. To harness the existing mobile infrastructure, diverse users are looking for effective and efficient ways, for instance, the Bayam Sellam in Cameroon. Bayam Sellam refers to people engaged in trade between rural and urban markets. This work analyses the usage and development of information and communication technology in Sub-Sahara Africa in general, and the mobile technology and its constraints in particular. An efficient use of the mobile technology depends on appropriate mobile services and applications. These should produce and use local digital content, so as to enhance the use of the existing mobile infrastructure and contribute to satisfy the user’s needs. As a case study, we deal with a tailored mobile commerce solution for Bayam Sellam and other related stakeholders such as the governmental department for price regulation. The arising question is how Bayam Sellam can use the mobile devices to improve their business activities and, thereby, use the mobile infrastructure more efficiently. With a questionnaire, we investigate the wishes of 250 Bayam Sellam in Ngaoundéré. The aim was to develop a tailored mobile commerce solution called Bayasella for Bayam Sellam. The solution is a hybrid application based on the approach of local data storage, web technologies and frameworks (HTML5, PhoneGap, etc.). Bayasella stores product details offline, and synchronises them with the online database whenever the user wants. The online activities (up/downloading offers) shall be very short so as to minimise charges. Another key issue is: if the provided architecture can be applied to other domains. We put our attention on a combined mobile weather application that impacts the mobile technology and the Bayam Sellam business activities. For this purpose, we combine endogenous qualitative weather data from ethnic group Tpuri with existing quantifiable data from established weather forecasting systems, such as World Weather Online.	apache cordova;aqua;computer data storage;digital recording;download;html5;mobile commerce;mobile device;online and offline	Paul Dayang	2014			simulation;engineering;operations management;computer security	HCI	-82.81688832727703	-7.88769426640364	44204

Recently, the rate of investigation about hydrogen generation is growing dramatically in many countries. Many studies have been done about hydrogen generation from natural resources such as wind, solar, coal etc. In this work we evaluated global scientific production of solar hydrogen generation papers from 2001 to 2014 in any journal of all the subject categories of the Science Citation Index compiled by Institute for Scientific Information (ISI), Philadelphia, USA. Solar hydrogen generation was used as keywords to search the parts of titles, abstracts, or keywords. The published output analysis showed that hydrogen generation from the sun research steadily increased over the past 14 years and the annual paper production in 2013 was about three times 2010-paper production. The number of papers considered in this research is 141 which have been published from 2001 to this date. There are clear distinctions among author keywords used in publications from the five most high-publishing countries such as USA, China, Australia, Germany and India in solar hydrogen studies. In order to evaluate this work quantitative and qualitative analysis methods were used to the development of global scientific production in a specific research field. The analytical results eventually provide several key findings and consider the overview hydrogen production according to the solar hydrogen generation.	abstract summary;categories;citation index;coal tar;compiler;paper;part dosing unit;scientific publication;hydrogen biosynthetic process	Mohammad Reza Maghami;Shahin navabi asl;Mohammad esmaeil Rezadad;Nader Ale Ebrahim;Chandima Gomes	2015		10.1007/s11192-015-1730-3	water splitting;text mining;social science;bibliometrics;computer science;hydrogen production;data mining	NLP	-75.3193366949565	-21.121569235610313	44230

Participation analysis, content analysis, and a thematic analysis were used to analyze public discussions on the site’s community forums. The findings show that participants are deeply committed to ongoing discussions about black community issues. However, none of these discussions moved beyond a discursive level of civic engagement, suggesting that the potential for mobilization through social networking online has not yet been realized, despite the traditional orientation to community service among blacks in America.	social network	Dara N.

9de092a71dc132c0428a9771fa687c4cd4160ddb	using linguistic cues for analyzing social movements		With the growth of social media usage, social activists try to leverage this platform to raise the awareness related to a social issue and engage the public worldwide. The broad use of social media platforms in recent years, made it easier for the people to stay up-to-date on the news related to regional and worldwide events. While social media, namely Twitter, assists social movements to connect with more people and mobilize the movement, traditional media such as news articles help in spreading the news related to the events in a broader aspect. In this study, we analyze linguistic features and cues, such as individualism vs. pluralism, sentiment and emotion to examine the relationship between the medium and discourse over time. We conduct this work in a specific application context, the “Black Lives Matter” (BLM) movement, and compare discussions related to this event in social media vs. news articles.	context (computing);emergence;pluralism (philosophy);social media	Rezvaneh Rezapour	2018	CoRR		individualism;leverage (finance);social issues;application context;pluralism (political theory);social media;computer science;linguistics;social movement	HCI	-81.76905474418531	-17.143938032019562	44376

However, in the mobile domain, limited empirical evidence exists showing the interplay among these three constructs and the role culture plays. To address this, we carried out a survey on four systematically designed mobile websites among 233 subjects from Canada and Nigeria, which belong to low- and high-context cultures respectively. Using path modeling, we investigated the relationships among the perceptions of these three HCI constructs and the possible differences that exist between the two cultures. Our results show: 1) it is the perception of aesthetics that predominantly drives the judgment of mobile web credibility at the global and subgroup levels, with the effect size being greater for the Canadian group than for the Nigerian group; 2) the direct effect of aesthetics on usability is moderated by culture, with the magnitude being stronger for the Nigerian group than for the Canadian group; and 3) our models explain 29-83% of the variance of credibility.	human–computer interaction;usability	Kiemute Oyibo;Julita Vassileva	2016		10.1145/3033701.3033711	web usability;usability;political science;usability engineering;multimedia;advertising;world wide web	HCI	-88.15280707332194	-15.558168481501069	44380

In such context, information security process (ISP) is one of the issues that can be influenced by BITA. However, the impact has yet not been researched. This paper investigates the BITA impact on ISP. For this in-vestigation, the relationships of elements of the Strategic Alignment Model and the components of Security Values Chain Model are considered. The research process is an in-depth literature survey followed by case study in two organiza-tions located in United States and the Middle East.

The results should support both practitioners and researchers to gain improved insights of the relationships between BITA and IT security components.	information security	Mohamed El Mekawy;Bilal Al Sabbagh;Stewart Kowalski	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-07293-7_3	simulation;engineering;operations management;operations research	Crypto	-79.60869461838598	1.5284808326525126	44456

We propose that peer influence may affect repeat behavior as well, though the process and source of influence are likely to differ between trial and repeat. Our analysis of the acceptance of a risky prescription drug by physicians provides three novel findings. First, there is evidence of contagion not only in trial but also in repeat. Second, who is most influential varies across stages. Physicians with high centrality in the discussion and referral network and with high prescription volume are influential in trial but not repeat. In contrast, immediate colleagues, few of whom are nominated as a discussion or referral partner, are influential in both trial and repeat. Third, who is most influenceable also varies across stages. For trial, it is physicians who do not consider themselves to be opinion leaders, whereas for repeat, it is those located towards the middle of the status distribution as measured by network centrality. The pattern of results is consistent with informational social influence reducing risk in trial and normative social influence increasing conformity in repeat.

Additionally, even if the online civic commons were to be utilized widely, there is little guarantee that it would affect elected officials’ policy decisions any more than aggregative public opinion polls do now. Though participating in online debates may be valuable to citizens for its epistemic benefits, as well as for its affordances for the development of a sense of community, Coleman and Blumler remain vague regarding how online public consultations would actually affect policy, other than to call for ‘genuine commitment by the various levels of government to rules of engagement that reinforce rather than undermine citizens political efficacy’ (p. 191). Despite these potential drawbacks, Coleman and Blumler offer a potentially valuable solution to the ills of contemporary democracy. Engaging and well-argued, The Internet and Democratic Citizenship provides an important contribution to discussions of how we might foster a more deliberative democracy.	international standard book number;internet;new media;vagueness	Lucian F.

The first documented reference to it dates from 1321, when most of the village was still located inside the fortified walls. Once a magnificent building of three naves sustained on fourteen stone columns, today only the ruins of its majestic manuelino style portal and its chapels at the head of the church remain. Around 1524, centuries after the conclusion of the initial architectural works, a new campaign was started on a time when the outskirts of the village of Montemor-o-Novo became more and more its economical epicenter. During the reign of king D. João III of Portugal, this construction campaign implied an almost complete reconstruction under the manuelino renovador style. It is precisely this phase that we are bringing back, via 3D scan and 3D modeling and through a reading of the Archaeology of Architecture of the existing ruins of the Igreja de Santa Maria do Bispo, in Montemor-o-Novo.	3d modeling;3d scanner;column (database);de novo transcriptome assembly;resource bounded measure	Carlos Carpetudo;Goncalo Lopes	2015	2015 Digital Heritage	10.1109/DigitalHeritage.2015.7419614	art;archaeology;theology	Vision	-67.29493560837393	-20.60703526355603	44513

A survey conducted in Malaysia with 469 SNS users aged 13-14 revealed that control-based parental mediation can cause boomerang effects, making young adolescents more inclined to taking risks in SNSs. While discussion-based parental mediation was found to be negatively related to young adolescents' befriending strangers in SNSs, it did not reduce privacy risks. Findings also suggested that peer influence could result in undesirable outcomes. In particular, the more young adolescents talked about Internet-related issues with peers, the more likely they were to disclose personally identifiable information on SNSs.	adolescent (age group);boomerang;personally identifiable information;phobia, social;privacy	Wonsun Shin;Nurzali Ismail	2014	Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking	10.1089/cyber.2014.0095	medicine;environmental health;pathology;suicide prevention;human factors and ergonomics;injury prevention;social psychology;computer security;mechanical engineering	HCI	-86.70928171423178	-20.408308375381843	44544

I argue that the existence and use of bridges in interpersonal networks also depends on individuals' health. Poor health may make it more difficult to withstand the pressures and to execute some of the common tasks associated with bridging (e.g., brokerage). I examine this possibility using egocentric network data on over 2,500 older adults drawn from the recent National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP). Multivariate regression analyses show that both cognitive and functional health are significantly positively associated with bridging, net of sociodemographic and life-course controls. The relationship between functional (kinesthetic) health and bridging appears to be partially mediated by network composition, as older adults who have poorer functional health also tend to have networks that are richer in strong ties. Several potential mediation mechanisms are discussed. Cognitive function remains significantly associated with bridging net of network composition, suggesting that the inherent challenges of maintaining bridging positions may be more difficult to cope with for those who have cognitive impairments than for those who have functional impairments such as limited mobility. An alternative explanation is that cognitively impaired individuals have more difficulty recognizing (and thus strategically using) bridges in their networks. Theoretical implications and possibilities for future research are discussed.	bridging (networking);cognition disorders;ephrin type-b receptor 1, human;general linear model;impaired cognition;personality;regression analysis;regression testing;span distance;structural holes	Benjamin Cornwell	2009	Social networks	10.1016/j.socnet.2008.10.005	psychology;gerontology;social science;sociology;social psychology;social network	HCI	-88.87160261370094	-21.42371849324011	44588

With a population of more than 1 billion people Africa represents a significant portion of the world population and ICT is a vital tool to release the creative potential and knowledge embedded in her people. In spite of great strides in terms of socio-economic development, the African continent continues to lag economically advanced nations in its research on the developmental impact of ICT. Whilst African countries are enthusiastically embracing ICT for socio-economic development, mainstream information systems (IS) research remains focused on the issues related to ICT in developed, mature economies in North America and Europe (Roztocki & Weistroffer, 2008). Increasing our understanding of the possibilities and limitations of ICT and how to promote its adoption and use in Africa to the benefit her people is of vital interest to researchers and practitioners alike. This special issue is about how ICTs are affecting and effecting development in Africa. The situation in Africa is unique in that she has some of the fastest growing countries in the world and at the same time, some of the poorest people living in it. Innovations in ICTs have meant that Africa is leading the world in mobile money and in some countries penetration of mobile phones is above 100%. This special issue on ICT in Africa explores whether ICTs can enable better lives for people in Africa and, if so, how and in what ways. This editorial comprises five sections. In section 1 we provide an overview on the state of ICTs on the African continent. Second, we examine the role of ICT with respect to development.

My analysis suggests that the professionalization of the sciences did make it a little easier for scientists to make significant contributions at a younger age. But, I also argue that it is easy to exaggerate the effects of professionalization. Older and middle age scientists continued to play an important role in making significant discoveries throughout the history of modern science.	nash equilibrium;scientometrics	K.

7cf397e06aaed3f019a44abc6f51fc917b9ce6b7	connecting mobile phones to the internet of things: a discussion of compatibility issues between epc and nfc	information management	Near Field Communication devices and Electronic Product Code tags are two important RFID based solutions which have matured to market-readiness within the last years. Though both standards are based on the same technological foundation, there are some significant differences as to the goals that their developers intend to achieve through their use. Mobile phones are the most popular personal devices world-wide, with roughly three billion units in operation as of 2006. Market researchers are anticipating that by 2012 20% of all sold phones will be NFC enabled. With 300 million NFC phones sold in 2012, mobile phones would become the largest infrastructure of RFID readers world wide. On the other side, EPC tags will steadily become more available on logistical units and consumer products. The fact that more than a billion consumers might be equipped with NFC enabled mobile phones by 2015 raises the question whether the compatibility of EPC item level tags to these devices would not offer significant benefits. Against this background, this contribution investigates the drivers and barriers of a fusion of NFC and EPC technology, and discusses the resulting potential from a business perspective.	electronic product code;internet of things;logistics;mobile phone;near field communication;radio-frequency identification	Thomas Wiechert;Frédéric Thiesse;Florian Michahelles;Patrick Schmitt;Elgar Fleisch	2007			engineering;advertising;internet privacy;computer security	Mobile	-81.37712610765482	-9.575020374332873	44837

The essay investigates how policy and decision issues resulting from Latin American technological development and its correlates can be plausibly addressed and argues for several theses, most notably, that in dealing with the issues, national legislation and international treaties have attained and are likely to attain their purposes only to a limited extent and in a mixed manner; that less legislation-dependent procedures evidence greater effectiveness and political feasibility; and that some globalization processes help fuel the environmental issues, while others help facilitate their resolution.

Research has identified several critical factors that influence trust. These have been incorporated into the design of e-commerce web portals; however a vast majority of potential users are still wary of online business transactions. This points to the need for the development of more sophisticated and comprehensive models that can provide additional insights into the true role played by trust in the adoption of e-commerce portals. Here we do so by focusing on trust as it pertains to B2C e-commerce transactions. Pertinent issues addressed are: (1) Is trust the critical factor that makes all the difference between users accepting or rejecting a B2C portal? (2) Are there factors that could play a more critical role in user acceptance/rejection of such portals? (3) If so, what is the relevance of trust relative to these factors? The research model and agenda introduced here enable researchers to view trust in its proper perspective as part of the bigger picture of technology acceptance.	e-commerce	Clyde W.

Four key questions are considered: (a) What is ELSI and how should it identify and address topics of interest for the CNMS? (b) What advantages accrue to incorporating ELSI into the CNMS? (c) How should the integration of ELSI into the CNMS take place? (d) How should one judge the effectiveness of the activity? We conclude that ELSI research is not a monolithic body of knowledge, but should be adapted to the question at hand. Our approach focuses on junctures in the R&D continuum at which key decisions occur, avoids topics of a purely ethical nature or advocacy, and seeks to gather data in ways that permit testing the validity of generalization. Integrating ELSI into the CNMS allows dealing with topics firmly grounded in science, offers concrete examples of potential downstream applications and provides access to the scientists using the CNMS and their insights and observations. As well, integration provides the opportunity for R&D managers to benefit from ELSI insights and the potential to modify R&D agendas. Successful integration is dependent on the particular ELSI question set that drives the project. In this case questions sought to identify key choices, information of value to scientists, institutional attributes, key attributes of the CNMS culture, and alternatives for communicating results. The opportunity to consult with scientists on ELSI implications is offered, but not promoted. Finally, ELSI effectiveness is judged by observing the use to which research products are put within the CNMS, ORNL, and the community of external scholars.	apache continuum;biological science disciplines;downstream (software development);emoticon;entity name part qualifier - adopted;generalization (psychology);intrinsic drive;occur (action);united states national institutes of health	David J.

Our findings can help understand variations in homogeneity of network neighbourhoods, i.e., in the degree to which these neighbourhoods act as""""echo chambers"""", as well as the high context-dependency of success rates for a certain type of network intervention studies.

However, some limits might be related to the availability of public economic resources that tends to affect the smaller libraries by reducing opening times and services provided.	quadruple-precision floating-point format	Maria Laura Ruiu;Massimo Ragnedda	2017	Public Library Quarterly	10.1080/01616846.2017.1318642	engineering;media studies	Crypto	-82.32857999718175	-20.82196798742759	45000
395b650c381fb3ea49cf27c193f6e8989967fd71	global software project management: a case study		Global software development (GSD) is a growing phenomenon in industry, including the ABB Group of companies, which has a long history of executing globally distributed development projects. Geographic and temporal separation, culturally-based misunderstandings, and language effects are well-described complications for GSD teams. These factors aggravate issues (on both a practical and a leadership level) in communication, trust, and coordination, impeding the effective sharing and management of team knowledge, and creating risks to project success. In the interest of continually improving our business performance, ABB has joined the research community in exploring these issues and ways to increase awareness and tactical support for GSD project managers. In this paper, we present aggregate findings from qualitative interviews with people across different sites in the organization, and describe how identifying, measuring, and actively managing GSD-related risks can help project managers and leaders in planning and executing projects more effectively.	software project management	Petra Björndal;Karen Smiley;Prateeti Mohapatra	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-13784-6_7	project 112;project management;extreme project management;program management;earned value management;project;software project management;opm3;systems engineering;application lifecycle management;project management 2.0;project management triangle;project charter;project planning;project method;project portfolio management;software peer review	SE	-84.67486341344396	1.2059821450017485	45006

It frames the debate in terms of the conforming properties of GIS. The proposal is that conservation GROs must conform to GIS to ensure effective usage; however, in the process of that use, they mould the GIS to their own objectives. Various examples from the North American conservation movement illustrate the properties of GIS conformity and likely outcomes of research. This paper asks the reader to rethink PPGIS and GIS diffusion. It also poses questions for further research that frames adoption as an issue of conformity.	geographic information system	R. E.

In this paper we initially review the literature on business models for digital content providers and note the wide variance in perspective amongst those writing in this field. Building on our work for the European Commission SimWeb project, we then consider the ways in which content providers in the online news industry actually operate and the ways in which they contribute to the content value chain, suggesting a framework of our own which suggests a continuum of business model types for cont ent provision – ranging from “pure” content provision at one end to an extension beyond content itself to the provision of the technology needed to read content at the other end. We then elaborate on this framework, discussing the ways in which companies are making money from content provision in the online news industry, on the basis of a number of cases within the European market. Finally, we discuss the possible directions other content providers might wish to take in this environment.	apache continuum;digital recording;internet;money	Cornelia C. Krueger;Paula M. C.

a4fbab0cc2dcdd050674a0ba4ad992cb3b026553	it security risk management in the context of cloud computing		Although providers’ decision makers constantly emphasize a low IT security risk (ITSR) in the Cloud, numerous serious IT security incidents have occurred over the last few years. Considering the theoretical availability of effective safeguards against most of these risks, it seems that in many cases, the Cloud providers’ decision makers may have underestimated the ITSRs. The psychological research terms comparable phenomena “unrealistic optimism”. While prior research has intensively studied the ITSR perceptions of (potential) Cloud customers, the provider side has been completely neglected. In general, even though correct IT security risk assessments are the foundation for effective IT security risk management in organizations, no research has been dedicated to the effects of organizational decision makers’ subjective ITSR perceptions on the implementation of necessary safeguards. Even more importantly, little or no attention has been paid to the existence and consequences of possible systematic errors in ITSR perceptions. Against this backdrop, the first part of this thesis adds a new perspective to the stream of organizational IT security risk management literature, one that sheds light on the importance of decision makers’ ITSR perceptions. Drawing on psychological risk perception theory, we propose an extended theoretical IT security risk management model that explicates how the subjective ITSR perceptions of decision-makers predict the outcome of providers’ IT security risk management. Additionally, we transfer established methods of measuring unrealistic optimism to the IT context, which enables us to systematically capture and analyze a potential underestimation of the ITSRs at the provider side. Based on a large-scale empirical study of Cloud providers located in North America, we reveal that in many cases, the providers’ decision makers significantly underestimate their services’ ITSR exposure, which inhibits the implementation of necessary safeguarding measures. We also demonstrate that even though the prevalence of ITSR perceptions among customers considering Cloud adoption is widely recognized, providers only pay very limited attention to the concerns expressed by customer companies. In this regard, the specific characteristics of the Cloud and the systematic underestimation of ITSRs by providers’ decision makers are likely to cause serious disagreements with (potential) customers about the ITSRs of the Cloud. Drawing on perceptual congruence literature, the second part of this thesis examines matched survey responses of Cloud providers and their (potential) customers located in Germany, showing a consistent pattern of perceptual differences across all ITSRs relevant to the Cloud. In this context, this thesis proposes an extended theoretical model of Cloud adoption that reveals that this disagreement has strong adverse effects on important downstream beliefs	cloud computing;risk management	André Loske	2015		10.1007/978-3-658-11340-7	computer security model;cloud computing security;security information and event management;security convergence;threat;utility computing;internet privacy;risk analysis;computer security	HPC	-85.49750965023276	-5.3059352078640885	45078

a4fd75fed637dc0b3606a5f02eb4fd7a9727d0c4	towards e-mail prevalence in media repertoires: evidence and explanations for knowledge workers of a public organization		E-mail is and remains widely used by knowledge workers in organizations. The objective of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, it aims at verifying e-mail is the most used medium by knowledge workers within their communication media repertoires. On the other hand, we try to understand which factors influence e-mail use. A public organization was selected to realize an in-depth case study with both quantitative and qualitative data. Quantitative analysis shows that e-mail is the preferred medium of knowledge workers to exchange documents and information. Moreover, individual characteristics poorly explain media use, and in particular e-mail use. Qualitative analysis of interviews with senior executives proposes organizational explanations of e-mail prevalence in this organization. Indeed in a moving, fuzzy and political organization, e-mail is preferred for several reasons that are advanced in this paper.

0ef3157db96b2e05863ec9c706ce09d6c2416fe5	citicafe: conversation-based intelligent platform for citizen engagement		"""Community civic engagement is a new and emerging trend in urban cities driven by the mission of developing responsible citizenship. The recognition of civic potential in every citizen goes a long way in creating sustainable societies. Technology is playing a vital role in helping this mission and over the last couple of years, there have been a plethora of social media avenues to report civic issues. Sites like Twitter, Facebook, and other online portals help citizens to report issues and register complaints. These complaints are analyzed by the public services to help understand and in-turn address these issues. However, once the complaint is registered, often no formal or informal feedback is given back from these sites to the citizens. This de-motivates citizens and may deter them from registering further complaints. In addition, these sites offer no holistic information about a neighborhood to the citizens. It is useful for people to know whether there are similar complaints posted by other people in the same area, the profile of all complaints and a know-how of how and when these complaints will be addressed.  In this paper, we create a conversation-based platform CitiCafe for enhancing citizen engagement front-ended by a virtual agent with a Twitter interface. This platform back-end stores and processes information pertaining to civic complaints in a city. A Twitter based conversation service allows citizens to have a direct correspondence with CitiCafe via """"tweets"""" and direct messages. The platform also helps citizens to (a) report problems and (b) gather information related to civic issues in different neighborhoods. This can also help, in the long run, to develop civic conversations among citizens and also between citizens and public services."""	blog;categorization;cluster analysis;emoticon;feedback;holism;natural language processing;portals;social media	Amol Dumrewal;Anwesh Basu;Shubham Atreja;Prateeti Mohapatra;Pooja Aggarwal;Gargi Dasgupta	2018		10.1145/3152494.3152511	complaint;civic engagement;conversation;public relations;data analysis;natural language user interface;social media;citizenship;business	HCI	-81.75478327005158	-17.38867059991727	45293

We combine insights from adoption and acceptance literature with media choice and task-technology fit theories. These insights are applied to a case in which police officers use mobile communication tools and information technologies. Officers were asked which mobile applications they preferred to use in specific situations (contexts) and for specific tasks. In a structural equation model focusing exclusively on individual TAM-related characteristics, such as perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, as well as on a generic media fit concept, the explanatory value of these concepts turns out to be high. We extend our study, based on Ajzen and Madden (1986) by arguing that, in addition to personal characteristics, contextual characteristics, in combination with task-related characteristics, play an important role in people's preferences for specific technologies. Conjoint analysis focusing on contextual and task-related characteristics yields relevant insights. When context-related and individual characteristics are combined into a single hierarchical linear model, the significance of the concepts used in TAM turns out to be low, while context-related issues stand out. On the basis of our research, we conclude that TAM models are too generic to fully explain people's intention to use mobile technologies. Future research should aim at developing models that take contextual and task-related factors into account when studying mobile applications.	ibm tivoli access manager	Harry Bouwman;Lidwien van de Wijngaert	2009	JIT	10.1057/jit.2008.36	computer science;engineering;knowledge management;electrical engineering;management information systems;management science;sociology;operations research;information technology;information system	HCI	-90.85455733729671	-9.089809613118893	45397

Therefore, this study investigated client attitudes towards online counseling. Data was collected from 48 e-clients who received online counseling at the Center for Online Addiction. Variables such as client perceptions and concerns about using online counseling, clients' reasons for seeking online counseling over in-office treatment, and demographic profiles of e-clients were assessed. Results suggested that Caucasian, middle-aged males, with at least a four-year bachelors degree were most likely to use online counseling and anonymity, convenience, and counselor credentials were the most cited reasons they sought online counseling over in-office treatment. The lack of perceived privacy and security during online chat sessions and the fear of being caught while conducting online sessions were the main concerns reported by e-clients. A better understanding of client motives and perceptions towards online counseling helps to guide treatment in using the Internet as a clinical tool, especially as the Internet becomes increasingly more available in previously remote markets and the field of online counseling continues to grow.	addictive behavior;attitude;clients;credential;fear (mental process);munchausen syndrome;online chat;online counseling;privacy;security through obscurity	Kimberly Young	2005	Cyberpsychology & behavior : the impact of the Internet, multimedia and virtual reality on behavior and society	10.1089/cpb.2005.8.172	applied psychology;medicine;social psychology;clinical psychology	Web+IR	-85.36995590481175	-21.487111958512813	45682

CSE let knowledge workers concert their efforts and support user collaboration. However, search terms and links clicked that are shared among users reveal their interests, habits, social relations and intentions. Thus, CSE might put the privacy of the users at risk. In this paper, we describe our first steps towards discovering the scope of privacy needs in CSE. We identify common components of CSE, and we describe typical use cases and user groups. Based on these information, we explore the range of privacy threats that might arise from query and link sharing. Furthermore, we outline a conceptual framework to explore the privacy needs of CSE users. Finally, we describe two findings from preliminary study results: First, our participants were less concerned about what providers might learn, but wanted to restrict information disclosed to people in their social network. Second, we have identified a new class of reciprocal privacy preferences, which allow or prohibit information disclose depending on the behavior of others.	privacy;social network;www;web search engine	Thorben Burghardt;Erik Buchmann;Klemens Böhm	2008	2008 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology	10.1109/WIIAT.2008.165	social relation;computer science;data mining;internet privacy;world wide web;search engine	Web+IR	-90.33955437891429	-15.373452786761826	45755

Governmental policy makers can apply established tools from the governmental toolbox to this end (e.g., laws, regulations, incentives, and disincentives). Alternatively, they can employ new tools that capitalize on the wealth of knowledge about human behavior and behavior change that has been accumulated in the behavioral sciences (e.g., psychology and economics). Two contrasting approaches to behavior change are nudge policies and boost policies. These policies rest on fundamentally different research programs on bounded rationality, namely, the heuristics and biases program and the simple heuristics program, respectively. This article examines the policy–theory coherence of each approach. To this end, it identifies the necessary assumptions underlying each policy and analyzes to what extent these assumptions are implied by the theoretical commitments of the respective research program. Two key results of this analysis are that the two policy approaches rest on diverging assumptions and that both suffer from disconnects with the respective theoretical program, but to different degrees: Nudging appears to be more adversely affected than boosting does. The article concludes with a discussion of the limits of the chosen evaluative dimension, policy–theory coherence, and reviews some other benchmarks on which policy programs can be assessed.	coherent;cyber-security regulation;heuristic (computer science);nudge (instant messaging);rationality	Till Grüne-Yanoff;Ralph Hertwig	2015	Minds and Machines	10.1007/s11023-015-9367-9	psychology;nudge theory;ecological rationality;epistemology;computer science;artificial intelligence;social heuristics;default;social psychology;algorithm;bounded rationality	ML	-74.42877201698218	-12.320132698948589	45784

Crisis management involves numerous aspects that should be considered in addition to making economic, political and legal/regulatory decisions. These must include social, culture, ethical, psychological, educational, environ- mental, provisional, technological, technical, organizational and managerial aspects. This article presents a model and system for such considerations and discusses certain composite parts of it.

Medium industries are those with a total fixed assets cost between 3 and 8 million Singapore dollars. This paper aims to discuss the problems encountered in robotization in small and medium industries. As a regional robotic center, we also like to share our experience gained in Singapore with industrialists in Hong Kong and other parts of the world.	robot	Yee Meng Yew	1985	Robotics	10.1016/S0167-8493(85)80022-X	engineering	Robotics	-72.18262852749835	-4.458947771996217	45841

With SNSs, people’s social networks are expanded by connecting to others with shared interests or values based on other users’ self-disclosed personal information. Business organizations can mine the personal information embedded in SNSs to identify potential customers to generate revenues. However, the benefits of SNSs cannot be completely achieved if their users do not disclose enough personal information. In this research, we relate users’ self-disclosure intentions and self-disclosure behaviors to certain characteristics of SNSs based on Technology Acceptance Model. Our research model is empirically tested through an online survey of 113 users in the context of Renren, the most popular SNS in China, and we find that users’ perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of a SNS closely associate with their self-disclosure intentions, which further leads to users’ actual self-disclosure behaviors.	embedded system;ibm tivoli access manager;personally identifiable information;social network;usability	Yanli Jia;Yi Zhao;Yuli Lin	2010	2010 Seventh International Conference on Information Technology: New Generations	10.1109/ITNG.2010.23	computer science;knowledge management;reliability;china;statistics;social network	HCI	-90.21726535628093	-11.586059617842125	45972

An equally important barrier to uid electronic commerce is the lack of agreed upon trusted third parties. We propose new non-third party mechanisms to overcome these barriers. Our solutions facilitate nding shared preferences, discovering communities with shared values, removing disincentives posed by liabilities, and negotiating on behalf of a group. We adapt known techniques from the cryptographic literature to enable these new capabilities.	cryptography;e-commerce;recommender system;user interface design	Bernardo A. Huberman;Matthew K.

In addition, this interest has been fuelled by the large success of online social networking sites and the subsequent abundance of social network data produced. A key aspect in this research field is the influence maximization in social networks. In this paper we discuss an overview about the models and the approaches widely used to analyse social networks. In this context, we also discuss data preparation and privacy concerns also considering different kind of approaches based on centrality measures.

7456b9ecad89d477757eaeb5a019bbac3b4e4382	estimation of the demand function of the information and communication construction business	market demand;ict construction business;ict policies;creative economy	The smart convergence environment, in which all industries are converged around ICT infrastructure -- with the eventual inclusion of both industry and culture -- looms. With the emergence of new convergence industries such as smart medicine, smart cities, and smart automobiles, the ICT infrastructure is recognized as the foundation of the overall economy. As such, the importance of the next generation of information and communication construction businesses, which constructs the ICT infrastructure, is highlighted under the smart convergence paradigm environment; various multilateral policies to foster the information and communication construction business -- led by the Ministry of Science, ICT, and Future Planning -- are being implemented. Like other infrastructure industries, however, the estimation of the demand function of the information and communication construction business overall is essential for effectively establishing promotional policies for information and communication construction businesses. However, there has been no study which theoretically estimates the market demand function in the information and communication construction business thus far. The pursuit of a creative economy is a national agenda, as the significance of accelerating the ICT infrastructure is emphasized. Therefore, this paper seeks to estimate quantitatively the demand function in the information and communication construction business using empirical data and a statistical model and then to present policy implications which will aid the development of the information and communication construction business.

This paper finds clear statistical evidence of the negative impact this had on total economic costs, including opportunity costs of capital, as well as working expenditure. Thus, additional support was provided for the then British railway policy already strongly suspicious of railway mergers on competition grounds. At the same time the findings could reopen the discussion on the wisdom of today’s British rail privatisation philosophy. In particular, one could argue that, instead of separating infrastructure and train operations, the creation of vertically-integrated regional duopolies along the pre-1899 networks might lead to genuine competition, require less regulation, reduce costs, and thus increase economic surplus.

f161dbd1536abaa99d81e7e3cbbc52a62c919ebe	focal structures analysis: identifying influential sets of individuals in a social network		Identifying influential individuals is a well-known approach in extracting actionable knowledge in a network. Existing studies suggest measures to identify influential individuals, i.e., they focus on the question “which individuals are best connected to others or have the most influence?”. Such individuals, however, may not represent the context (relationships, interactions, etc.) entirely in a social network. For example, it is nearly an impossible task for a single individual to organize a mass protest of the scale of the Saudi Arabian women’s 2013 Oct26Driving campaign, the 2012 Occupy Wall Street and the 2011 Arab Spring. Similarly, other events such as mobilizing the 2013 Taksim square-Gezi Park protesters, coordinating crisis response for natural disasters (e.g., the 2010 Haiti earthquake), or even organizing flash mobs would require a key set of individuals rather than a single or the most influential individual in a social network. An alternate line of research dealing with community or cluster identification approaches extract subnetworks of individuals. However, these structures may not represent the key sets of individuals that could coordinate the social processes mentioned above. Therefore, we develop the Focal Structures Analysis (FSA) methodology to extract such key sets of individuals, called focal structures, in a social network. This research goes beyond the traditional unit of analysis, which is an individual or a set of influential individuals, and places focal structures between the individuals and communities/clusters as the unit of analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this type of work is the first effort in identifying influential sets of individuals and would open up new directions for researchers to develop new methods in social network analysis.	adobe flash;domain driven data mining;focal (programming language);interaction;organizing (structure);social network analysis	Fatih Sen;Rolf T.

Based on a conceptual analysis of resource integration and value proposing as the foundational practices of value co-creation, this article portrays value propositions as the co-created forms of shared resources and understanding, which constitutes service systems. This view is inherently socially constructed and perceives value propositions as institutionalized, taken-for-granted social structures that influence local instances of resource integration within and between service systems. Because of the idiosyncratic local contexts for resource integration, however, value propositions do not completely govern resource integration. Instead, they are reproduced and transformed through the local interactions they influence. This mutually constituting nature between value propositions and resource integration affects our understanding of stability and change, creating novel avenues for studying innovation on the basis of service science.	interaction;social structure	Jaakko Siltaloppi;Stephen L.

4a002e3f0fd598c828debfccbab2c4610a59d7a7	assessing internet voting as an early voting reform in the united states		Recent research on convenience voting reforms in the United States has found that programs designed to make voting easier have not succeeded in boosting turnout, and have even had the unintended consequence of exacerbating the demographic biases that already exist in the electorate by encouraging votes among those who were most likely to vote anyway but who were inconvenienced by going to the polls on election day. Using public voting records and a unique dataset of Internet voters in the 2004 Michigan Democratic Presidential primary, this paper offers new evidence that Internet voting benefits two groups of people: young voters and people who vote infrequently. Like previous research on voting reforms, I also find evidence that Internet voting does not draw new voters into the electorate. I discuss the implications of these findings for the future of early voting reforms in general and Internet voting in particular.	boosting (machine learning);unintended consequences	Alicia Kolar Prevost	2008			straight-ticket voting;ceramic;metallurgy;economic policy;cement;ranked voting system;voting;porosity;early voting;grog;political science	ECom	-86.1361101955267	-21.254584716792422	46547

The use of camera surveillance has taken an enormous flight in the past decades. Despite this increase, its effectiveness is strongly debated. One reason for the disputed effectiveness may be that an understanding of how to use camera surveillance, including elements contributing to the effectiveness of camera operators, has not kept track with technological developments. This paper focuses on the role of expertise and familiarity with the environment on the effectiveness of camera operators to detect offenders in video footage from Rotterdam City Surveillance in the Netherlands. Results show no effect of expertise, but do show that familiarity with the location contributes to operator effectiveness and that camera operators seem to use different criteria for detecting and selecting suspects depending on the familiarity with the location. These results contribute to our understanding of operator effectiveness and offer guidelines for the training of camera operators. Implications are discussed.	risk aversion;sensor	Remco Wijn;Helma van den Berg;Maaike Lousberg	2011	Personal and Ubiquitous Computing	10.1007/s00779-011-0480-3	computer vision;simulation;detection theory	HCI	-73.3271745056567	-9.581743716353587	46585

In legal terms, this IoT convergence has parallels in concepts such as accession, commixture, confusion and comingling. These legal concepts have broadly speaking, the same application within the context of property law, where property law includes real property such as land, moveable property such as chattels or things (including human tissue), and tangible and intangible property (intellectual property).	accession number (bioinformatics);internet of things;parallels desktop for mac	Helaine Leggat	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops (PerCom Workshops)	10.1109/PERCOMW.2017.7917632	ethics;convergence;computer science;internet privacy;privacy;computer security;internet of things	Robotics	-74.11701572311608	-13.129251762287852	46657

6c418c01025a1e329c63d1f23f0979e9864df1cc	the use of ambiguous messages as a strategy to appeal to multiple decision makers		Messages that are tailored to specific audiences (matched messages) are typically more persuasive compared to messages that are crafted for a general audience (Hirsh, Kang, & Bodenhauser, 2012). However, tailoring messages can have the effect that messages are less persuasive for audiences for which they were not tailored (mismatched messages; Sillince, Jarzabkowski, & Shaw, 2012). Eisenberg (1984) introduced the concept of strategic ambiguity to appeal to multiple audiences simultaneously. We systematically compared effects of matched/mismatched tailored messages with the effects of ambiguous messages on multiple-criteria choice behavior. We found evidence that ambiguous messages can be used under certain conditions to simultaneously appeal to multiple audiences within the context of credit card choices. Using the financial control typology developed by Shefrin and Nicols (2014) to define different audiences, the study (154 participants) provided some support for the use of ambiguity as a tool for tailoring messages to diverse credit-card holders.	biological anthropology	Devika Banerji;Torsten Reimer;Chris Roland	2017			social psychology;psychology;appeal	HCI	-91.29014645749359	-15.208340490156276	46791

It describes the major arguments for and against using ill-gotten information in research, and shows how they may be applied to research that either collects information about the Internet itself or which uses data from questionable or unknown sources on the Internet. Three examples (the Internet Census 2012, the PharmaLeaks study, and research into keylogger dropzones) demonstrate how researchers address the ethical issues raised by the sources of data that they use and how the existing arguments concerning the use of ill-gotten information apply to Internet research. The problems faced by researchers who collect or use data from the Internet are shown to be the same problems faced by researchers in other fields who may obtain or use ill-gotten information.

2778b6640c5a0a27f5b7677444125884a403ba51	identification numbers as pseudonyms in the eu public sector		In recent years the use of pseudonyms as false identities over one's actual birth name has increased rapidly. The main driver behind this growth is the Internet, where virtually every user employs at least one pseudonym. Also public legal entities have resorted to issuing pseudonyms mostly in the guise of identification numbers to their subjects. Contrary to the historical use of pseudonyms as a means for concealing one's identity, such public sector issued pseudonyms are rather used for unique and trustworthy identification. The use of pseudonyms can, however, entail a number of risks, specifically concerning the protection of the privacy of the citizen regarding data exchange and data linking. In this article, the national identity schemes of selected EU Member States will be analysed to assess how pseudonyms are introduced as means for public sector identification and what the practical impact is of the purported privacy concerns.	entity;internet;privacy;pseudonymity;trust (emotion)	Niels Vandezande	2011	European Journal of Law and Technology		public relations;geography;internet privacy;computer security	Security	-72.68296437403977	-10.237272227050564	46850

As many of the studies are limited to collect the opinion of the customer, the other side of the coin is not coming to lime light. So, the present study intended to capture the opinion of the employees regarding two vital aspects -- the ability of the organization to follow the pioneers of the industry with respect to adapting online banking practices and the hurdles that the online banking organizations are facing nationally and internationally. Two research questions are framed accordingly and the opinion of the employee regarding the questions is collected. A total of 90 employees of three reputed banks are selected at random and data is collected from them using the study tool, questionnaire. The collected is analyzed using simple statistical techniques and portrayed for better understanding. For the first question, answer is taken as yes and no and for the second research question, the average of the opinions regarding the social, economic, political and legal environments is considered. Thus, the opinion of the employees about Nigerian technology market is portrayed using pictorial representation. From the figures, it is affirmed that strategies have been being implemented in Nigeria by following the forerunners of the online banking industry. At the same time, it is also opined by majority of employees that the compartmentalized working of the sectors has become a big problem for the development of the online banking. On the whole, it is proved that synchronized services of all the sectors, aimed at customer oriented collaborative strategies can convince the customers to use online banking ventures and hence to upgrade themselves	image;online banking;online service provider;lime	Joseph Funsho Omonaiye;V.

Consumers are increasingly trying to find ways to interact and transact with other consumers via the Web. This study utilizes young adults to assess a consumer’s choice to use consumer-to-consumer (C2C) electronic commerce by examining a consumer’s computer self-efficacy, Web experience, and C2C electronic commerce trust. In addition, mediating effects of C2C electronic commerce satisfaction between the above-mentioned variables and C2C electronic commerce choice is investigated. The findings indicate only Web experience predicts a young adult’s choice for C2C electronic commerce. In addition, satisfaction was found to be a mediator between Web experience and choice.

The paper analyzes patent knowledge to identify research trends. A model based on knowledge extraction from patents and self-organizing maps for knowledge representation is presented. The model was tested on patents from the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The experiments show that the method provides both an overview of the directions of the trends and a drill-down perspective of current trends.	organizing (structure);self-organization;self-organizing map	Aviv Segev;Jussi Kantola	2012	Expert Syst.

The real challenges to development are the social and political aspects of change. Imagining new organizational structures is difficult because knowledge about existing structures is often objectified. Furthermore, the power structures of organizations make such imagination more difficult or even forbidden. This paper describes a study in which a prototype of an information systems (IS) development method, called the Labour Game, was evaluated in field experiments. The paper describes the method and demonstrates how it succeeded in shifting the focus of discussions from technical development to issues which typically increased the competence of employees and modified the power structures of the work processes. The paper advocates the use of ‘soft’ methods, which help users and managers to talk about the social structures of work and consequently about different IS requirements in the early phases of systems development.	power player super joy iii;software development process	Vesa Torvinen;Katarina Jalonen	2000	EJIS	10.1057/palgrave.ejis.3000342	computer science;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;electrical engineering;management information systems;management science;information technology;information system	Logic	-72.92480995877995	-0.007985678977184626	47092
a6cca9cb8f3f5c5945993a71820e96d88e0533f8	the fourth branch of government and the historical legacy of the bush administration's information policies	information policy	In June 2007, Vice President Cheney declared his office to be exempt from the executive branch information reporting requirements because he had decided that the Office of the Vice President is not part of the executive branch. This argument is based on the idea that, as the titular President of the Senate, the Vice President has responsibilities both in the executive and legislative branches, so is part of neither.While this argument is virtually withoutmerit in terms of the Constitution—the Vice Presidency is listed as part of the executive branch in the Constitution and has been a part of the executive branch for the history of the republic—it is indicative of a broad picture of misuses and abuses of the structure, history, and integrity of the republic itself resulting from the George W. Bush administration's obsessions with controlling information. It also reaffirms the tortured lengths to which this administration will go to achieve its aims of information control. Most significantly for scholars, it reinforces the need for research to focus on the broad tapestry of the information policies of the Bush administration to better understand the current and potential future impacts of these policies on society and governance. During the first term of the administration, former White House counsel John Dean (2004) wrote a book entitledWorse thanWatergate to chronicle the various cases of the Bush administration skirting or possibly outright violating the law. While the “worse thanWatergate” phrase is undoubtedly catchy, it is quite incomplete in capturing the true problems of the past eight years. Collectively, the activities of this administration are not just worse than Watergate, they may be worse thanWatergate as well as the worst unconstitutional excesses of other former administrations. As befits living in an information age defined by speed and capacity of technology to access and exchange information, the most radical aspects of Bush administration policies seem to cluster around hiding and controlling information. As “information access and exchange lies at the heart of deliberative democracy” (Jaeger & Burnett, 2005, p. 474), these policies raise enormous questions about the health of the republic, especially if such policies are continued by subsequent administrations. When information is not available for scrutiny, analysis, and dialogue by the public, the press, and other branches of government, and when the government collects more information about citizens while releasing less information about its own activities, the actions of the executive branch can occur unchecked by the delicate democratic balance envisioned by the framers of the Constitution. Overall, the George W. Bush administration may have matched or outdone the worst excesses in U.S. history by the federal government as far as infringing on individual rights. In fact, the most startling information policies of the Bush administration often darkly echo the bleakest episodes of executive misuses of information policy in U.S.	goto;information access;requirement	Paul T.

Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems have recently been developed for this sector but their successful implementation is a challenge. One of the major factors contributing to this challenge is user adoption. This paper presents an overview of user adoption constraints affecting two medium sized South African organisations when adopting an ERP system. Two qualitative in-depth case studies were analysed using the grounded theory method. The 11 direct and 3 indirect user adoption constraints identified were categorized under organisational conditions, facilitating conditions, implementation actions, system expectations and system perceptions. User communication was the dominant constraint and was found to be influenced by organisational culture and reseller value. Many conditions and experiences were found to be distinct from previous research typically performed in large organisations in developed economies. It is hoped that the model presented will be able to assist SMEs within emerging economies in improving the success of their ERP implementations.	categorization;erp;enterprise resource planning;enterprise system;experience	Isabel Jansen van Vuuren;Lisa F.

The ability to persuade individuals is quite clear in e-commerce, where individuals are persuaded to make purchasing decisions. However, it can also be applied to other disciplines, such as education where improving the study behaviour of students would be particularly useful. Forming good study habits can be a challenge for university students who have not done so in the earlier years of their education, or where the pressures of external commitments have eroded previously good habits. We use a combination of the Fogg Behavioural Model and the Hook model to design features for an app as a component of a larger persuasive system to help improve three key areas of study habits: study scheduling, class preparation and group study. The app will be built and tested in a university setting targeting undergraduate students.	b. j. fogg;e-commerce;purchasing;scheduling (computing)	Justin Filippou;Christopher Cheong;France Cheong	2016	CoRR		simulation;multimedia;advertising	HCI	-88.4012500238645	-23.324474588114278	47186

In the current study, the dimensionality of Web-based information systems (WIS) satisfaction was first examined. Two composite latent variable models with factor-order structures were then empirically tested and compared to describe the relationships among observable variables concerned with WIS satisfaction. Using data from a sample of 515 university students, a third-order composite latent variable model was retained based on statistical and theoretical criteria. At the third-order level, WIS satisfaction is determined by two second-order constructs: Web information satisfaction and Web system satisfaction. Web information satisfaction is determined by understandability, reliability, and usefulness, while Web system satisfaction is determined by access, usability, and navigation. Overall, the model provides a good fit to the data and is theoretically valid, reflecting logical consistency.

Many of the key words are the same, but their use in the language is markedly different.

2c6c8ce52b42caa0755ee6f6bf9fc1d07dac0d7a	chminf-l: the chemical information sources discussion list	computer mediated communication;chemistry;computer networks	The Chemical Information Sources Discussion List (CHMINF-L) was established at Indiana University in April 199 1 and became fully operational on May 1, 199 1. In less than three and a half years, it has established a reputation as a high-quality Internet resource for keeping up with new information products of interest to chemists and for getting answers to chemical information questions in general. CHMINF-L serves as a forum for discussion of, as well as an information source for, chemistry reference questions and the sources used to find information that chemists need. News about existing reference sources, the appearance of new primary, secondary, or tertiary printed or computer-readable sources, prices and availability, search hints, bibliographic instruction-all are found as topics distributed on CHMINF-L. People have also used CHMINF-L as a “reference library” to supplement the resources of their local libraries. That is appropriate as long as users are willing to supply answers. Fortunately, the subscriber list to CHMINF-L includes some of the best chemistry librarians and chemical information specialists in the world, and they have unselfishly given of their time and energy to answer many questions. Jane Smith, in a provocative article entitled, “Hypatia Screamed,” concludes that “ . . . the skills of librarians and the tenets of librarianship will be increasingly critical if we are to deliver on the promises of the ‘Information Age’ ” (1994).

Customers acknowledge that online consumer reviews help them to determine eWOM credibility and to make purchasing decisions. This study uses surveys and multiple regression analysis to create an extended Elaboration Likelihood Model that describes the relationship between customer expertise, involvement, and rapport to acceptance and use of electronic word of mouth in making purchasing decisions. The study focuses on the cultural effects of gender on the extended Elaboration Likelihood Model and purchasing decisions in e-commerce virtual communities. Study results show that involvement has the most significant effect on perceived eWOM credibility. Study results show that perceived eWOM credibility has a significant effect on eWOM acceptance and intent to purchase. Study results also show the male customers have different e-commerce shopping behaviors than female customers.	e-commerce;elaboration likelihood model;purchasing;social media marketing;virtual community	Yi-Wen Fan;Yifeng Miao	2012	IJEBM		marketing;advertising;business;commerce	HCI	-89.26003194034354	-11.798989482260648	47290
86b54d66d1e005ebaf25367536d482eee975f7ce	information security awareness : improving current research and practice	information security;behaviour change;awareness;attitudes	Large-scale data losses experienced across both public and private sector organisations have led to expectations that organisations will develop a culture that supports information security aims and objectives. Despite the fact that many organisations now run awareness, education and training programmes for their employees, however, information security incidents due to employee misuse of information still keep occurring. This suggests that these programmes are not working. The research presented in this thesis examines ways to better understand employees’ attitudes towards information security with a view to improving current organisational practice. The research explores whether Chief Information Security Officers are delivering organisational change for information security, before moving on to better understand employee’s attitudes and how these are translated into behaviours. The research takes a mixed-methods approach that is not often used in information security research and combines both qualitative and quantitative analytical methods, grounded in the theory of social psychology. Case studies are carried out with Chief Information Security Officers as well as at the Office of Fair Trading and Prudential plc. The research delivers a survey tool that can be used in organisations to better understand how to frame information security messages so that they achieve their aims. An expert panel of users evaluated the survey. The research concluded that end users fall into two groups – the ‘I Can Handle It Group’ and the ‘It’s Out of My Control Group’ and these substantive findings have been validated by a field experiment. By mirroring the attributions of the dominant group the field experiment demonstrates that it is possible to influence employees’ behaviour.	information security awareness	D. M.

The most challenging obstacle in the construction process is to achieve a successful practice and to identify and apply an ethical framework to manage the behavior of involved specialists and contractors and to ensure the quality of all completed construction activities. The framework should reflect a common moral ground for myriad people involved in this process to survive and compete ethically in today's turbulent construction market. This study establishes a framework for moral judgment of behavior and actions conducted in the construction process. The moral framework provides the basis of judging actions as """"moral"""" or """"immoral"""" based on three levels of moral accountability: personal, professional, and social. The social aspect of the proposed framework is developed primarily from the essential attributes of normative business decision-making models identified in the literature review and subsequently incorporates additional attributes related to professional and personal moral values. The normative decision-making models reviewed are based primarily on social attributes as related to moral theories (e.g., utilitarianism, duty, rights, virtue, etc.). The professional and moral attributes are established by identifying a set of common moral values recognized by professionals in the construction industry and required to prevent common construction breaches. The moral framework presented here is the complementary part of the ethical framework developed in Part I of this article and is based primarily on the personal behavior or the moral aspect of professional responsibility. The framework can be implemented as a form of preventive personal ethics, which would help avoid ethical dilemmas and moral implications in the first place. Furthermore, the moral framework can be considered as a decision-making model to guide actions and improve the moral reasoning process, which would help individuals think through possible implications and the consequences of ethical and moral issues in the construction industry."""

79c6c35075da509653fe23dca06e7a7770598baf	editorial: mediatized stories: mediation perspectives on digital storytelling	digital storytelling	There is an explosion of digital means by which people can shape and share stories about themselves. New media and new conditions of telling ‘my’ or ‘our’ story are open to more individuals and groups in society.This special section of New Media & Society relates to such self-representational uses of the new means. Digital stories made by amateurs may encourage social participation in those contexts where the stories are produced and used.The kind of digital storytelling to be discussed here opens new ways of participation: in ‘story circles’ offline, as well as online peer contact on social networking sites.The following two articles discuss the emergent space of self-representational digital storytelling, with its risks and its opportunities for democracy and individual identity formation in media-saturated societies. Although small-scale and bottom-up, these mediated self-narrative practices are prisms through which to look into the significant social consequences of new media. ‘Digital storytelling’, as suggested by Nick Couldry in this issue p. 374, means ‘the whole range of personal stories now being told in potentially public form using digital media resources’.	bottom-up parsing;digital data;digital media;emergence;new media;online and offline;top-down and bottom-up design	Knut Lundby	2008	New Media & Society	10.1177/1461444808089413	multimedia;sociology;world wide web	HCI	-70.33863067786551	-19.803857849471886	47404

It is proposed that the same sequence is found to underlie many forms of media entertainment, albeit substantially scaled down. Hence, a distinct theory of intellectual entertainment is put forward. The seemingly timeless presence of multiple forms of intellectual entertainment finds its roots in a positive moral approval of the self of itself.		José I. Latorre;María T. Soto-Sanfiel	2011	J.

Affect researchers widely acknowledge the “sadder but wiser” phenomenon, but there is little evidence if this tendency can be applied to the driving environment as well. The objective of the present study is to empirically test whether sadness enhances driving performance as the sadder but wiser notion might predict or sadness impairs driving performance as its negative valence or low arousal dimension might predict. The study consists of a simulated driving experiment with induced anger, sadness, and neutral affect to examine how anger and sadness influence driving-related risk perception, driving performance, and perceived workload. Sixty-one young drivers drove under three different road conditions with either induced anger, sadness, or neutral affect conditions. After affect induction, there was no difference in subjective risk perception across three ...		Myounghoon Jeon	2016	Int. J. Hum. Comput.

Studies of social media and diabetes have focused mostly on patients, or public agencies addressing it, but have not looked broadly at all of the participants or the diversity of content they contribute. We study Twitter conversations about diabetes through the systematic analysis of 2.5 million tweets collected over 8 months and the interactions between their authors. We address three questions. (1) What themes arise in these tweets? (2) Who are the most influential users? (3) Which type of users contribute to which themes? We answer these questions using a mixed-methods approach, integrating techniques from anthropology, network science and information retrieval such as thematic coding, temporal network analysis and community and topic detection. Diabetes-related tweets fall within broad thematic groups: health information, news, social interaction and commercial. At the same time, humorous messages and references to popular culture appear consistently, more than any other type of tweet. We classify authors according to their temporal 'hub' and 'authority' scores. Whereas the hub landscape is diffuse and fluid over time, top authorities are highly persistent across time and comprise bloggers, advocacy groups and NGOs related to diabetes, as well as for-profit entities without specific diabetes expertise. Top authorities fall into seven interest communities as derived from their Twitter follower network. Our findings have implications for public health professionals and policy makers who seek to use social media as an engagement tool and to inform policy design.	anthropology;blog;community;diabetes mellitus;entity;health promotion;information retrieval;interaction;network science;patients;social media;the hub (forum);theme (computing);usb hub;message	Mariano Beguerisse-Díaz;Amy K.

There are wide variations of the traditions across the archipelago, and we revisit an observation to one in Subang, West Java, Indonesia. The paper discusses and employs the evolutionary game theoretic insights to see the process of “gantangan”, of the intertwining social cohesion and economic expectation of the participation within the traditional activities. The current development of the “gantangan” tradition is approached and generalized to propose a view between the economic and social sphere surrounding modern people. The interaction between social and economic sphere might be seen as a kind of Lokta-Volterra’s predator-prey-like interaction, where both are conflicting yet in a great necessity one another for the sustainability of the social life. While some explanations due to the current development of “gantangan” is drawn, some aspects related to traditional views complying the modern life with social and economic expectations is outlined.	group cohesiveness;java;lotka–volterra equations;prey;theory	Hokky Situngkir;Yanu Endar Prasetyo	2012	CoRR		evolutionary game theory;social science;economics;decision theory;artificial intelligence;socioeconomics;evolution;sociology;management	HCI	-77.39433176989397	-9.21982560412059	47693

We pitted two user-defined categorizations of information-seeking situations against each other to predict user reports of source use. The first was how users described situations in material terms -i.e. what kinds of situations they saw themselves as facing in terms of the usual categorizations applied by systems such as everyday life-facing (e.g. housing, health); and, scholarship, research. The second consisted of a series of six situation """"emotions"""" assessments, rating scales that users applied to situations. The core research question focused on understanding when source use was best accounted for by nature of situation and/or by situational """"emotions"""" assessments.

First, adolescents who participate in more leisure activities, who have more digital resources, and who have more friends who are SNS members are more likely to be SNS members. Second, we hypothesize and show that for adopting communication technology that highly fluctuates in popularity and is highly timedependent, individuals are more likely to be early Facebook adopters when the number of their friends who are Facebook members increases. Finally, non-native adolescents are also more likely to be early Facebook adopters.

It is a world-wide broadcasting capability, a mechanism for information and interaction between individuals without regard to geographical distances. However it is no denying a fact that the majority of languages used on the Internet are non-English. Keeping in view these facts it was obvious that non-English speakers would access their local sites and would communicate via email using their own local scripts. Efforts in this regard have already been made in Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK), in Arabic and in other languages. Languages on the Internet should be treated equally, and non-English speakers deserve to utilize their own languages to take full advantage of the Internet in their own way with the freedom of the language identity, written traditions and written scripts. The Arabic language and other languages that use Arabic script, like Pakistani national language Urdu and regional language Sindhi, are among them. This paper explores the current issues in Arabic Top Level Domains (TLDs) and proposes a solution, which not only resolves these issues for the Arabic language but also introduces Urdu and Sindhi TLDs.

The collaboration with LC marked one of the first of NCL's digitization project. The project began in 2005 and ended in 2012, during which a total of 2,025 titles of rare books were digitized and made available on the internet.

Consequently, researchers in information systems and marketing have been focusing on investigating the effectiveness of Web-based decision support systems (WebDSS) in providing accurate and satisfying choices for customers. We consider WebDSS implementation based on compensatory, non-compensatory decision strategies and synthesize the existing literature. The results of synthesis show that compensatory WebDSS perform better than non-compensatory WebDSS in terms of decision quality, satisfaction, effort, and confidence. We then investigate the level of Web site support provided for consumers’ execution of compensatory and non-compensatory strategies. We examined 375 U.S.-based company Web sites and found that though moderate levels of support exists for consumers to implement	decision quality;decision support system;e-commerce;exploratory testing;information system;online shopping;web	Naveen Gudigantala;Jaeki Song;Donald R.

738e5459f68a02c9584139f6f45e50bd3cca833d	impacts of big data on data mining research: an empirical study of chinese journals		With the advent of big data, data mining theories and methods face new challenges. This paper tries to find the impacts of big data on data mining research through 23377 data mining-related papers published in Chinese academic journals during 1996--2016. By utilization of various methods of bibliometrics, this study conducts three different levels of analysis to gradually dig deeper into the contents of literature. For the macro-level, paper amount analysis results show that big data-related research began in 2012 and has brought new growth to data mining area. For the meso-level, journal distribution analysis results indicate that many other disciplines, such as arts and agriculture science, began to apply data mining techniques with the wide spread of big data. For the micro-level, co-word-based research topic clustering results imply that new topics emerged due to the easy access of big data, such as u0027clouding computingu0027 and u0027teaching and learning analysisu0027.	accessibility;behavior;bibliometrics;big data;cloud computing;cluster analysis;coword;data mining;desmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma;diving (activity);journal;mesoscopic physics;paper;scientific publication;contents - htmllinktype;statistical cluster	Yue Huang	2018		10.1145/3265689.3265706	empirical research;data mining;the arts;bibliometrics;big data;cluster analysis;computer science	ML	-76.86732966738462	-18.7155504158534	48100

917e4dad0d3a2f27b32b4171bce7718ceada8ba1	understanding success through the diversity of collaborators and the milestone of career		Scientific collaboration is vital to many fields, and it is common to see scholars seek out experienced researchers or experts in a domain with whom they can share knowledge, experience, and resources. To explore the diversity of research collaborations, this paper performs a temporal analysis on the scientific careers of researchers in the field of computer science. Specifically, we analyze collaborators using two indicators: the research topic diversity, measured by the Author-Conference-Topic model and cosine, and the impact diversity, measured by the normalized standard deviation of h-indices. We find that the collaborators of high-impact researchers tend to study diverse research topics and have diverse h-indices. Moreover, by setting Ph.D. graduation as an important milestone in researchers’ careers, we examine several indicators related to scientific collaboration and their effects on a career. The results show that collaborating with authoritative authors plays an important role prior to a researcher’s Ph.D. graduation, but working with non-authoritative authors carries more weight after Ph.D. graduation.	big data;computer science;knowledge organization;service innovation;topic model	Yi Bu;Ying Ding;Jian Xu;Xingkun Liang;Gege Gao;Yiming Zhao	2018	JASIST	10.1002/asi.23911	computer science;knowledge management	ML	-78.7533619113667	-19.887199073222448	48312
286f9cab3c86633895330cb8ae03a303cde5205e	statistical theory aids inference in scientometrics	research productivity	Laboratory size may affect the number of scientific publications per capita. However, no analysis I have seen of my data or of other data has demonstrated the existence of such an effect convincingly. An analysis5 of patentable research among 500 leading industrial firms concluded that the number of patents filed per year divided by annual sales is independent of the annual sales, i.e., on the average, small, medium and large industrial firms are all equally inventive. If patents are viewed as a measure of research productivity in the commercial sector, and if sales are viewed as a measure of size or research effort (a company's research budget would be a better measure), then this finding that the ratio of patents to total sales is independent of total sales exactly parallels my finding that publications per capita are independent of laboratory size. The parallelism of these findings suggests the possibility that, in general, the productivity per capita of a research effort is independent of the total size of the research effort, whether the setting is academic or commercial. Whether or not this empirical generalization is ultimately confirmed, the methodological message of this note seems to me less arguable.	commercial software;parallel computing;parallels desktop for mac;scientific literature;scientometrics	Joanna E Cohen	1984	Scientometrics	10.1007/BF02020111	econometrics;computer science;data science;statistics	DB	-78.47181466343326	-21.88648717234568	48360
5a53b05544a6c8d45bab69dcc9c8c5bc9495ca3a	on laws of robotics		Discussions of any and all conceivable ‘Behavioral Laws for Agents (Robots)’ would be a topic appropriate for several conferences. Since the panel (on which I am to serve) lasts only an hour and a half, I am assuming in what follows below that the theme for this panel would be Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics. Regarding Asimov’s First Law – A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm – I am not sure whether or not even intelligent human beings are capable of obeying this law when they are willing and wanting to do so. It is often not so easy to know in advance what will or will not harm a human being. Even something as straight forward as an air-bag in an automobile can sometimes inflate itself accidentally, causing injuries to those in the car and sometimes to those outside. I don’t know of many simple safety devices to protect human lives that are really fail-safe in this sense. If we do not always know what will or will not harm human beings, how do we design a device or a robot that will protect us? Are we limiting ourselves here to simple (relatively) straight forward situations, such as an elevator free-falling fifty stories or a mid-air collision of two airplanes? Even the second case would not necessarily be a simple problem involving only two airplanes. The Second Law – A robot obey orders given it by human beings, except where orders would conflict with the First Law – would be comparatively easy to enforce, except the part where the compliance with the First Law is involved. For example, if a police officer were to use a deadly (robotic) weapon to protect a citizen from a gun-toting mugger about to kill a law-abiding citizen, how does the robotic weapon resolve its conflicting requirements that it should not harm a human being but should not, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm? How would it know which life to protect or not to take? The Third Law – A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second law – would similarly be not so difficult to design into robots except where the compliance with the First Law is relevant. Compliance with Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics would consist of two basic elements. (A) Robot’s ability to judge what, if any, robotic laws are about to be infringed upon or invoked, and analyze the situation for proper action – or inaction as the case may be. (B) Robot’s ability to do whatever it takes to comply with the robotic laws. Of the above two, (A) appears to be the more difficult of the two tasks as it could involve complex decision making. Problems would appear to arise whenever or wherever the compliance with the First Law becomes an issue.

Because of the centricity of the technology artifact, much of this research builds upon theories and prescriptions adapted from the information systems discipline. In information systems, the study of artifact design has benefitted from the adoption of the rigor and generalizeability enabled by design science research. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of design science principles guiding the construction of technological artifacts, which we use to examine recent digital government research articles that fall into the design science camp. We assess these articles using Hevner et al.’s (2004) guidelines for conducting and presenting design science research, identify common strengths, and recommend how digital government researchers may benefit from applying a grounded view of design to expand the generalizeability of their work. Finally, we conclude the paper with a discussion of ways to open up the narrow focus of design science to a broader understanding of the impact of external factors, such as the environment and organizational milieu, on the complex setting most digital government innovation inhabits.	e-government;information system;milieu intérieur;theory	Jane Fedorowicz;Martin A.

It argues that the vision of Digital Earth put forward by VicePresident Al Gore 10 years ago needs to be re-evaluated in the light of the many developments in the fields of information technology, data infrastructures, and earth observation that have taken place since. It focuses the vision on the nextgeneration Digital Earth and identifies priority research areas to support this vision. The paper is offered as input for discussion among different stakeholder communities with the aim to shape research and policy over the next 5-10 years.	geographic information science;gore (segment)	Massimo Craglia;Michael F.

In this paper the principle will first be outlined and then some of the common criticisms discussed. One in particular will be examined in some depth; the criticism is that it is inherently paradoxical. The paradox supposedly arises because if the principle is applied to some action that is potentially harmful, it should also be applied to that application of it which is also potentially harmful, because it stops an action that is beneficial. Here it will be argued that the precautionary principle is not paradoxical and that it is important and useful.	moravec's paradox	John Weckert	2010	2010 IEEE International Symposium on Technology and Society	10.1109/ISTAS.2010.5514653	political science;socioeconomics;principle;nanotechnology	Arch	-73.79210291774835	-13.560204801378038	48440

deb673252f105f8249bb9f652c56fa18897a7a22	towards a theory of sociocitizenry: quality anticipation, trust configuration, and approved adaptation of governmental social media		Abstract The past few years have witnessed growing governmental interest in engaging citizens through social media. With this interest comes a genuine need to understand the process and outcomes of government–citizen interactions. Therefore, this article seeks to address this important issue by proposing and validating a SocioCitizenry theory that depicts government–citizen interaction through social media. The present study uses data gathered through two field surveys and analyses the relationships among three main SocioCitizenry constructs: quality anticipation, trust configuration, and approved adaptation. The following factors are examined with respect to the aforementioned three constructs: differential influences of familiarity with social media and government services; perceived importance of interactions with government services; social media quality reputation; and family members’ and friends’ perceptions of social media quality. Overall, results show that anticipated governmental social media quality influences configured trust, which in turn influences the extent of approved adaptation. The implications of these results in research and practice are discussed.	social media;theory	Adel M. Aladwani;Yogesh Kumar Dwivedi	2018	Int J.

In this paper we report on a study we conducted at a semiconductor manufacturing company to better understand how global teams can work more effectively across one of these boundaries — time separation. More specifically, we investigate how time zones affect coordination costs and other coordination outcomes, and which coordination processes and mechanism are more effective in helping overcome the difficulties associated with time separation. The study was conducted through semi-structured interviews of 23 global team members working on technical projects in several locations around the globe.	semiconductor device fabrication;semiconductor industry	J.

3c187c2a40b8bb5b33b7f95bec48258e36e1beeb	exploring hiv-aids interests in the mena region using internet based searches		Due to the scarcity of official data on sexually transmitted diseases in the Middle East and North Africa region (MENA), it becomes important to seek alternative indications on the online information interests and possible spread of such diseases. This paper uses news stories from 10 Arabic media outlets, Wikipedia views, and data from Google Trends as well as social media on the HIV-AIDS epidemic. In order to investigate whether Internet searches are driven or influenced by media coverage, the correlation between media coverage and Internet searches is examined. The results indicate that there are very weak to moderate correlations between the two as media coverage of HIV-AIDS is not a good indicator of public attention. Data sources that are more accessible, like Google and Wikipedia searches and social media, can provide a better understanding of public information interests. Also, data retrieved from Google Trends in relation to the search terms “AIDS treatment” and “AIDS symptoms” provide important indicators on the top cities from which searches often originate. The findings of the study can aid health practitioners in identifying interest in and awareness of HIV-AIDS in the MENA region.	internet	Ahmed Al-Rawi	2017	First Monday		arabic;computer science;public relations;hiv/aids;scarcity;internet privacy;the internet;social media	DB	-81.0463905925467	-16.851283984050923	48567

If there is an imbalance and no expectation of change in the future, a relationship might be terminated. The question is: Which relationships are discontinued? The data are from a longitudinal study of 2057 older adults who identify 18,915 relationships at T . A relationship is regarded as discontinued if it is not identified by the older adult at 1 the second and third observations. Of the T relationships, 4042 have since been discontinued. The results of a 1 multilevel logistic regression analysis show that the more intensive the support exchanges are at T , the more 1 likely it is for relationships to be continued. Relationships where older adults are overbenefited with instrumental support, i.e., receive more than they give, have a higher chance of being continued. However, if older adults are overbenefited with emotional support, this decreases the chance of the relationships continuing. The type of relationship has a significant effect on whether or not it is continued. Close kin relationships are most likely to be continued, and relationships with less close kin, friends, and neighbors have a higher chance of being discontinued. The costs of the relationship are also decisive; the higher the contact frequency and the lower the traveling time to the network member, the higher the chance of the relationship being continued. Furthermore, the larger the network of the older adult, the more likely it is for an unbalanced relationship to be discontinued. q 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Illustrations are based on a survey of 150 young people, and structural equation modelling techniques were used to analyse the data. In this paper: (1) the relevant literature is reviewed; (2) a theoretical framework is built, and hypotheses proposed based on consumer innovativeness theory; (3) the results of an empirical survey designed to test these hypotheses are presented; and (4) it concludes with a general discussion and proposed directions for future research. In this study, the psychometric characteristics and criterion (predictive) validity of the scale are evaluated in order to support claims that domain specific innovativeness scale integrated with psychological and cognitive items could be used to research this domain of consumer behaviour. Evidence for a unidimensional measure of vicarious innovativeness is provided.		Margherita Pagani	2007	Techn. Analysis & Strat.

As a preliminary study in intercultural communication through social media, we analyze one case, the Asian American Chicago Network (AACN) Facebook group, and uncover common topics users discuss and relationships between user tenure and various indicators of leadership and interaction. Our small finalized results from this preliminary project suggest that members of AACN likely use it (1) to build a professional network in the U.S.A., and (2) to reinforce and affirm their Asian culture and identities.

b63055b1f5ab7e7f9a229a53d3572dae267b33b0	the impact of territorial and relational belonging on member retention in social networking sites		With the growth in social networking and the highly competitive nature of the social networking market, it is important to understand the factors that influence social network site (SNS) member retention. In order to better understand continuation intention among SNS members, the authors propose and empirically test a model built upon the IS continuance model, motivation theory, and two belongingness constructs drawn from social psychology. Results of this study indicate that positive confirmation, perceived usefulness, and perceived enjoyment influence user satisfaction, which in turn has a strong impact on continuance intention. In addition, the member’s sense of territorial belonging to the SNS has a positive influence on both continuance intention and perceived enjoyment. The member’s sense of belonging stemming from relationships with others within the community has a positive influence on both perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment, but appears to be insignificant with respect to a direct influence on continuance intention.

The aim to make digital signing and its use with various types of documents more convenient and efficient has had a high priority in the state’s e-Governance initiative. In this article we provide a study of the systematic introduction and use of digital signatures with documents related to decision-making processes and analyze the factors which influence this. We look at local governments as a major use case and provide an overview of the digital signing statistics for local government document exchange. The article highlights the differences related to the size and administrative capacity of the local governments as well as their readiness to transition into the information society.	archive;digital signature;e-governance;e-government;formal verification;interoperability;login;tamper resistance	Ingrid Pappel;Ingmar Pappel;Jaak Tepandi;Dirk Draheim	2017	T.

However, the local and the global are not polarities but interdependent categories representing multilayered space, which may be shaped, to a certain degree, through participatory e-planning. With participatory e-planning we mean the socio-cultural, ethical and political practice which takes place offline and online in the overlapping phases of the planning and decision–making cycle, by using digital and non-digital tools. But how does participatory e-planning that mainly serves the community, also help stakeholders to play with the glocal? The aim of the article is to present a set of examples from the Finnish context and to discuss, how community informatics may provide opportunities for stakeholders to deal with the glocal in the area of environmental improvement. On the basis of our comparative analyses and a case study in Finland, we claim that participatory e-planning enhances playing with the glocal, if certain technical, organizational and institutional capacities and a supportive infrastructure exist.

FastCompany[1] and BusinessWeek[2] magazines show examples weekly. At the same time, as difficult as coming up with a new idea that differentiates a company's product from those of its competitors can be, just coming up with the idea itself sometimes seems easy compared to the challenge of getting an organization to accept and act on it. Enabling User Experience Research and Design teams to deliver design solutions that change market dynamics often requires changes to culture and process. It also requires improving the political positioning of the User Experience organization. This case study highlights a method one UX team used to bring key stakeholders, including UX, Engineering, and Product Management, to the strategy table, and enable such strategic design. This UX team introduced collaborative design workshops to enable them to collaboratively generate great ideas and align their multidisciplinary product team around them. Such workshops enabled integrative thinking[3] to enable teams to arrive at the optimal solution. They also fostered trust, promoted free expression, and quietly created a new strategy table, where UX led the discussion about product strategy, introducing design as a key differentiator. In this example, such workshops provided a venue for engaging a cross-functional team in brainstorming and creative ideation, filtering a large set of ideas, collaborating on design, rapidly gathering user feedback and iterating designs, and getting the consensus the team needed to drive innovative products to market.	a/ux;align (company);content-control software;differentiator;integrative level;user experience;venue (sound system)	James E.

784d21ba4d55cbc4a79feaf56ff5433813dc17e0	analyzing the network structure and gender differences among the members of the networked knowledge organization systems (nkos) community		In this paper, we analyze a major part of the research output of the Networked Knowledge Organization Systems (NKOS) community in the period 2000 to 2016 from a network analytical perspective. We focus on the papers presented at the European and U.S. NKOS workshops and in addition four special issues on NKOS in the last 16 years. For this purpose, we have generated an open dataset, the ”NKOS bibliography” which covers the bibliographic information of the research output. We analyze the co-authorship network of this community which results in 123 papers with a sum of 256 distinct authors. We use standard network analytic measures such as degree, betweenness and closeness centrality to describe the co-authorship network of the NKOS dataset. First, we investigate global properties of the network over time. Second, we analyze the centrality of the authors in the NKOS network. Lastly, we investigate gender differences in collaboration behavior in this community. Our results show that apart from differences in centrality measures of the scholars, they have higher tendency to collaborate with those in the same institution or the same geographic proximity. We also find that homophily is higher among women in this community. Apart from small differences in closeness and clustering among men and women, we do not find any significant dissimilarities with respect to other centralities.
