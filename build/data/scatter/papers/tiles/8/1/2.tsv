1bd0a646bfd8c41fa6b357f0336a648e3a394eb9	exploring behavior representation for learning analytics	interaction analysis;learning sciences;performance;human factors;algorithms;experimentation;modeling	Multimodal analysis has long been an integral part of studying learning. Historically multimodal analyses of learning have been extremely laborious and time intensive. However, researchers have recently been exploring ways to use multimodal computational analysis in the service of studying how people learn in complex learning environments. In an effort to advance this research agenda, we present a comparative analysis of four different data segmentation techniques. In particular, we propose affect- and pose-based data segmentation, as alternatives to human-based segmentation, and fixed-window segmentation. In a study of ten dyads working on an open-ended engineering design task, we find that affect- and pose-based segmentation are more effective, than traditional approaches, for drawing correlations between learning-relevant constructs, and multimodal behaviors. We also find that pose-based segmentation outperforms the two more traditional segmentation strategies for predicting student success on the hands-on task. In this paper we discuss the algorithms used, our results, and the implications that this work may have in non-education-related contexts.	algorithm;engineering design process;floor and ceiling functions;hands-on computing;human-based computation;multimodal interaction;nonlinear gameplay;qualitative comparative analysis	Marcelo Worsley;Stefan Scherer;Louis-Philippe Morency;Paulo Blikstein	2015		10.1145/2818346.2820737	computer vision;simulation;systems modeling;human–computer interaction;performance;computer science;artificial intelligence;human factors and ergonomics;data science;machine learning;learning sciences	HCI	-67.5423792341536	-38.450024180574275	20461

I hypothesize that agent verbal expressiveness may improve the interaction between pedagogical agents and learners, ultimately enhancing learning outcomes. Evidence from a quasi-experimental investigation, indicates that learners who interacted with an expressive agent 1) scored higher on a post-task exam; and 2) rated the agent's ability to interact higher, than learners who interacted with a nonexpressive agent. Qualitative results provided insight into this finding, while indicating the complexity of deploying pedagogical agents in educational settings.		George Veletsianos	2009	J. Comp.

Organised unit testing (regression testing or test-first activities) are very popular in commercial practice, while ad-hoc (interactive) testing is popular in small scale and experimental development environments and teaching situations. These testing styles are usually kept separate. This paper introduces a design and implementation of a system that combines these testing styles to create a tool for new testing activities that both communities – professional and educational – may benefit from.	ad hoc testing;bluej;hoc (programming language);interaction;interoperability;junit;positive feedback;regression testing;test-driven development;unit testing	Michael Kölling;Andrew Patterson	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-24853-8_39	education;regression testing;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;software development;computer programming;development environment;unit testing;programming language;ad hoc testing;algorithm	HCI	-83.12163927364706	-36.101183968300916	20588

Before the practice, teachers first upload resources for students to prepare for practice activity. After preparation, students should pass a quiz before going on to the practice part. In the process of practice, students should submit practice reports according to the timeline of the network system. Teachers follow students' process, make evaluations and give suggestions to students' work. After the practice activity, teachers grade students' final practice reports. They also present typical problems and excellent reports to students online, so students can further understand the goal of practice. All in all, the practical training network offers an open and interactive educational platform, and enhances the communication between students and teachers. Three years of practicing the new network proves the beneficial affects it has on students' engineering practical ability.	timeline;upload	Wenxiang Xia;Jincheng Li;Zhiwen Song;Baoxiu Zhao;Ailing Xu;Xiaxin Li	2017		10.1145/3175536.3175540	specialty;the internet;timeline;environmental engineering;upload;engineering	HCI	-78.87304952296365	-39.87831310831738	20667
a98fbf4f5fd0924b07b9e91db4d794e4ee60b508	a semantic web-based authoring tool to facilitate the planning of collaborative learning scenarios compliant with learning theories	beginning teachers;collaborative learning design;vignettes;public school teachers;computer uses in education;semantics;instructional design;preservice teachers;foreign countries;learning theories;semantic web;cooperative learning;authoring tool;ontology;cscl	When the goal of group activities is to support long-term learning, the task of designing well-thought-out collaborative learning (CL) scenarios is an important key to success. To help students adequately acquire and develop their knowledge and skills, a teacher can plan a scenario that increases the probability for learning to occur. Such a scenario defines pedagogically sound structures that prevent off-task behavior and engage students in more meaningful interactions. The main difficulty in designing effective CL scenarios is transforming the teacher's intentions into elements that constitute the learning scenario. This problem is frequently observed when novice teachers attempt to improve the quality of learning and instruction by blending collaborative activities with individual activities without careful planning. With the goal of helping teachers in planning collaborative scenarios, we have developed an intelligent authoring tool referred to as CHOCOLATO using Semantic Web technologies (e.g. ontologies) in order to represent knowledge about different pedagogies and practices related to collaboration. Through the use of this knowledge, CHOCOLATO can provide intelligent guidance that helps teachers to create theory-based CL scenarios which has proven to be effective in a variety of situations. We evaluated it by conducting two experiments. We were interested in verifying whether the recommendations given by CHOCOLATO help novice teachers to design pedagogically sound CL activities, and if these activities help students to learn collaboratively in real classroom settings. The first experiment had the participation of 58 pre-service teachers that created CL scenarios with and without our authoring tool and the second experiment was carried out in a Brazilian public school together with 218 students. The results suggest that the guidance provided by CHOCOLATO do help novice teachers plan, understand and share CL scenarios more easily. They also suggest that the continuous utilization of well-designed theory-based CL activities create favorable conditions for students (particularly less knowledgeable ones) to improve their overall performance throughout the school year.	semantic web;theory	Seiji Isotani;Riichiro Mizoguchi;Sadao Isotani;Olimpio M.

Components of the systems approach are too frequently missing from information systems programs in business schools. The purpose of this paper is to determine the degree to which the IS 2010: Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Programs contains the systems approach in its learning objectives as well as specific course content. By examining the curriculum guidelines a preliminary judgment can be made concerning evidence of the systems approach having a broad implementation across information systems programs. The paper concludes with a discussion of the importance of the systems approach in the IS curriculum and establishing the systems approach as a theme in the curriculum of IS programs.		George P.

The authors design an educational method, dynamic group guidance using quiz functions for network based lecturing, and present an implementation method. Using the dynamic group guidance function, the system groups students automatically according to the results of quizzes and a teacher can guide each group individually. Supported by the system, therefore, a teacher can guide every student in a lecture efficiently according to his/her own level of understanding. We have realized the system using two technologies: user profiling and software agents.	real-time transcription	Akira Okada;Hiroyuki Tarumi;Yahiko Kambayashi	2000		10.1109/WISE.2000.882879	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;artificial intelligence;human factors and ergonomics;software agent;multimedia;world wide web	ML	-80.86446372834907	-42.177736577602964	20745

We put forth two hypotheses: Trainees find the HoloLens helpful and 2.) HoloLens helps the trainees to achieve a better score in objective skill assessment tests. METHODS: Software module was developed to show instructional video in the HoloLens under voice command. Thirtytwo participants were split into the control group or the HoloLens group. The control group used videos displayed on a computer during training while the HoloLens group practiced with Suture Tutor. Each group was given seven minutes to train with their assigned training method before testing. Testing involved replication of a running locking suturing pattern with a time limit of five minutes and was video recorded. The videos were expert reviewed. Participants in the HoloLens group filled out a usability survey. RESULTS: The trainees found the Hololens to be usable and realistic, and the HoloLens group used the instructional videos more than the control group did (p = 0.0175). There was no difference in the skill assessment test scores between the HoloLens and the control group and their rates of completion in the allotted time was similar. CONCLUSION: Participants found the Suture Tutor to be a user friendly and helpful adjunct. The study was unable to determine if the Suture Tutor helps trainees in achieving a better score in skill assessment testing.	cognitive tutor;common hardware reference platform;lia-ufscar;lock (computer science);microsoft hololens;speech recognition;teaching method;usability	Hillary Lia;Gregory Paulin;Caitlin T.

8b440d997a93cd465fd2cf4025051a2edb418cb0	dissect: integrating computational thinking in the traditional k-12 curricula through collaborative teaching (abstract only)	computational thinking;k12 outreach	The goal of the DISSECT program is to integrate computational thinking lessons into general education K-12 classrooms via graduate student/teacher partnerships. The idea of combining the teaching of CT with other disciplines is not new and it has taken shape in a variety of recent efforts in the formal education of youth. What is promising and innovative is the approach as it is implemented in K12 DISSECT classrooms. Through a collaborative teaching partnership, teachers gain a new perspective regarding computer science, and in cooperation with graduate students well-versed in computer science concepts, develop lessons and course modules that serve two purposes: 1.) Address K-12 content standards in core disciplines (e.g., language arts, life science) and 2.) Introduce CT concepts, such as abstraction, algorithms, data analysis and modeling. This poster describes ways computational thinking (CT) is taught in general K-12 classrooms in New Mexico through cooperative teaching. Along with their potential to stimulate interest in computing, these pilot modules were viewed by K12 teachers as enhancing disciplinary course content that teachers are charged with teaching (e.g., middle school science, language arts), deemed vital for sustainability in K12 schools by participating teachers. Preliminary data indicate graduate student and teacher satisfaction with cooperative teaching of CT. Next steps for research will involve student level data collection and analysis.	algorithm;computational thinking;computer science	Sarah Hug;Josh Sandry;Ryan Vordermann;Enrico Pontelli;Ben Wright	2013		10.1145/2445196.2445452	computer science;teaching method;multimedia;pedagogy	AI	-78.31096850578083	-34.58689978889666	20788
86854d71bf91729d946596a3fb6f2b40a2dd3ad3	affective support in narrative-centered learning environments	affective interfaces;applications in education	The link between affect and student learning has been the subject of increasing attention in recent years. Affective states such as flow and curiosity tend to have positive correlations with learning while negative states such as boredom and frustration have the opposite effect. Consequently, it is a goal of many intelligent tutoring systems to guide students toward emotional states that are conducive to learning through affective interventions. While much work has gone into understanding the relation between student learning and affective experiences, it is not clear how these relationships manifest themselves in narrative-centered learning environments. These environments embed learning within the context of an engaging narrative that can benefit from “affective scaffolding.” However, in order to provide an optimal level of support for students, the following research questions must be answered: 1) What is the nature of affective experiences in interactive learning environments? 2) How is affect impacted by personal traits, beliefs and learning strategies, and what role does affect have in shaping traits, beliefs, and learning strategies? 3) What strategies can be used to successfully create an optimal affective learning experience?	affective computing;experience;interaction;liquid-crystal display;negativity (quantum mechanics);population;traffic shaping	Jennifer Sabourin	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-24571-8_31	psychology;cooperative learning;computer science;experiential learning;multimedia;active learning;communication;social psychology	AI	-71.74738684028418	-41.33543357160808	20803

It consists in centralizing within the platform a series of services shared by many educational softwares.

Furthermore, Vygotskij’s educational model includes a strong bent towards social and collaborative learning. The joint answer to these two trends can be concretely implemented through a tight integration between personalized learning paths and collaborative learning activities. Along this line, the authors designed the combination of the functions of two pre-existing prototypes of web-based systems, to investigate how the above integration can merge adaptive and social e-learning. LECOMPS is a web-based e-learning environment for the automated construction of adaptive learning paths. SOCIALX is a web-based system for shared e-learning activities, which implements a reputation system to provide feedback to its participants. The authors propose a two-way tunneling strategy to integrate the above prototypes. The result is twofold: on the one hand the use of the student model supported by LECOMPS in an adaptive e-learning course is extended to support choosing exercise activities delivered through SOCIALX; on the other hand the reputation and the skills gained during social-collaborative activities are used to update the student model. Under the social perspective induced by the integration, the authors present a mapping between the student model and the definition of Vygotskij’s Autonomous Problem Solving and Proximal Development regions, with the aim to provide the learner with better guidance, especially in the selection of available social learning activities.

All methods share the common basis of some secret knowledge and rely upon the users ability to recall it in order to achieve authentication. An experimental trial is described, along with the results based upon 27 participants. The alternative methods are assessed in terms of practical effectiveness (in this context relating to the participant’s ability to authenticate themselves a significant time after initial use of the methods), as well as the perceived levels of user friendliness and security that they provide. The investigation concludes that while passwords and PIN approaches garner good ratings on the basis of their existing familiarity to the participants, other methods based upon image recall and cognitive questions also achieved sufficiently positive results to suggest them as viable alternatives in certain contexts.	algorithm;authentication;cognition;graphical user interface;identifier;login;password;personal identification number;usability	I.

The subject must be committed to a daily exercising routine, as well as to a frequent contact with the therapist. Rehabilitation plans can be quite expensive and time-consuming. On the other hand, tele-rehabilitation systems can be really helpful and efficient for both subjects and therapists. In this paper, we present ReAdapt, an adaptive module for a tele-rehabilitation system that takes into consideration the progress and performance of the exercising utilizing multisensing data and adjusts the session difficulty resulting to a personalized session. Multimodal data such as speech, facial expressions and body motion are being collected during the exercising and feed the system to decide on the exercise and session difficulty. We formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process and apply a Reinforcement Learning algorithm to train and evaluate the system on simulated data.	algorithm;algorithmic learning theory;markov chain;markov decision process;multimodal interaction;personalization;reinforcement learning;television	Konstantinos Tsiakas;Manfred Huber;Fillia Makedon	2015		10.1145/2769493.2769507	markov decision process;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;multimedia;reinforcement learning	AI	-67.95443557163651	-51.257535069003076	21101

This platform provides an advanced learning analytics module with useful visualizations. Nevertheless, it can be improved. In this paper, we describe ALAS-KA, which provides an extension of the learning analytics support for the Khan Academy platform. We herein present an overview of the architecture of ALAS-KA. In addition, we report the different types of visualizations and information provided by ALAS-KA, which have not been available previously in the Khan Academy platform. ALAS-KA includes new visualizations for the entire class and also for individual students. Individual visualizations can be used to check on the learning styles of students based on all the indicators available. ALAS-KA visualizations help teachers and students to make decisions in the learning process. The paper presents some guidelines and examples to help teachers make these decisions based on data from undergraduate courses, where ALAS-KA was installed. These courses (physics, chemistry, and mathematics) for freshmen were developed at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M) and were taken by more than 300 students.	chi academy;digital native;experiment;feedback;graphics;ka band;online and offline;self-reflection;visual analytics	José A.

As one of 14 centres for the field study of the WHOQOL Disabilities module, a stratified representative sample of Guangzhou general disabled people was approached for interview. It contained 1000 respondents: 807 physical disabled people and 193 intellectual disabled people. IRT GRM analysis was used to evaluate the construct validity of WHOQOL-BREF & Disabilities module. Each domain of WHOQOL-BREF showed appropriate fit to the two-parameter IRT GRM. The Disabilities module as overall one domain had a better fitting than as three domains. Discrimination parameters of item 3, 11, 12, 14, 16 and 25 were statistically equal to one for both the PD 5-point response version and the ID 3-point response version of the scales. The domain test information curves showed that the PD group had a larger range of scale scores of information >5 than the ID group. The construct validity of WHOQOL-BREF and Disabilities module using GRM analysis complements previous validation studies.	field research;id-wsf;item response theory	Zehui He;Jiqian Fang;Yuantao Hao;Jianting Tao	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)	10.1109/BIBM.2014.6999218	data modeling;computer science;organization;reliability;statistics	HCI	-86.12696912321789	-40.80073307935151	21180
728670b57290195dfd94900c51799a28aa994756	towards an adaptive and personalized assessment model based on ontologies, context and collaborative filtering		The assessment phase plays a very important role during the students’ teaching-learning processes since from this phase the knowledge acquired by them are validated and the shortcomings and/or strengths from students are detected. However, to do so, the questions selection made by the teacher or the learning platform does not always respond to the needs, limitations and/or cognitive characteristics of the students. In this context, it become necessary the incorporation of mechanisms that allows to obtain the main student features in a better way in order to use them during the process of question selection. In fact, this brings several benefits such as a better acquired knowledge measurement, an increase in the students’ interests, a better fail detection for new educational resource recommendation, among others. In order to make a better question selection that fulfil the student’s needs, this paper aim at proposing a characterization of the most relevant techniques and models for question selection. Likewise, an ontological model of personalized adaptive assessment is proposed, supported by Artificial Intelligence techniques that incorporate relevant cognitive and contextual information of the student to carry out a better selection and classification of questions during the e-assessment process.

Such is probably the reason for a number of higher education institutions to include in their Software Engineering curricula some form of contact with the FLOSS reality. This paper explores such a perspective through an on-going case study on university students’ collaboration in FLOSS projects. The aim of this research is to 1) identify what should be learnt about software development through regular participation in a FLOSS project/community, and 2) assess the didactic potential of this kind of non-standard learning experiences. To this aim we resorted to a participatory research action approach and qualitative methods, namely case studies combining direct observation and interviews.	autonomous robot;experience;software development;software engineering	Sara Fernandes;Maria Helena Martinho;Antonio Cerone;Luís Soares Barbosa	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-41347-6_15	systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;pedagogy	SE	-81.25900473323308	-33.731209687833704	21323

The model of distributed shared sense-making incorporates mutually constitutive interactions among sense-making systems, among mental models of sense-making systems, and between sense-making systems and their mental models. The model provides an integrated theoretical framework to support empirical examination of interactions among humans, and among humans and their cultural tools--in particular, their technological tools. The study uses the proposed theoretical framework to interpret teacher-student developing interactions in a technology-rich middle-school science classroom over the course of a year of scaffolded introduction to inquiry-based science instruction.	sensemaking;theory	Barbara G.

Such dialogue often contains factual claims, but participants and readers are left wondering what to believe, particularly when contributions to such dialogue come from a broad spectrum of the public. We explore the design space for introducing authoritative information into public dialogue, with the goal of supporting constructive rather than confrontational discourse. We also present a specific design and realization of an archetypal sociotechnical system of this kind, namely an on-demand fact-checking service integrated into a crowdsourced voters guide powered by deliberating citizens. The fact-checking service was co-designed with and staffed by professional librarians. Our evaluation examines the service from the perspectives of both users and librarians.	crowdsourcing;librarian;sociotechnical system	Travis Kriplean;Caitlin Bonnar;Alan Borning;Bo Kinney;Brian T.

The research was based on the mental models theory which proposes that people can be trained to develop a â€œmental modelâ€​ or a qualitative simulation of a system which will aid in generating methods for interacting with the system, debugging errors, and keeping track of one's place in the system. It follows that conceptual training based on a system model will be superior to procedural training based on the mechanics of the system. We performed a laboratory experiment with two training conditions (model and procedural), and with each condition split by sex. Forty-three subjects participated in the experiment, but only 32 were able to reach the minimum competency level required to complete the experiment.

Computers that we are responsible for in labs, classrooms, and faculty and staff offices require constant attention as manufacturer-supplied program patches and updates become available. Missing a critical update or patch in your networked environment can spell disaster or cost countless hours of """"cleaning up"""" after an errant worm wreaks havoc on unpatched machines.  Microsoft has done a good job of publishing operating system patches and critical updates; however, actually updating all of the machines in the academic environment can be a daunting task. While we can adequately use Windows Automatic Update in the homogeneous lab and classroom environment, the procedure can be circumvented by users in their offices. And while user education seems to be effective at first, system updates soon take a back seat to users' regular work and research tasks.  This paper discusses an enterprise update strategy that was adopted by Tulane University's Freeman School of Business. We will discuss the challenges associated with updating hundreds of workstations in labs, classrooms, and faculty and staff offices. We will look at several patch management software products that we reviewed and discuss their relative merits. We will then discuss the selected product and its implementation in the current production environment, including the user education involved and the political issues surrounding """"touching"""" desktops.

However, watching lecture videos alone would be boring and make the self-paced learning difficult and inefficient, since students could not be monitored by the teacher and accompanied by classmates. In this paper, we propose an adaptive video learning system to motivate students and grab their attention by inserting the interactive e-partner into the lecture videos. The e-partner's behaviors would evolve and animate with the student's learning style and the lecturer's teaching behavior, so that students can be encouraged to focus on the lecture content and enjoy the self-paced learning at the same time. The experimental results show that the augmented lecture video produced by our proposed system could improve the students' viewing experience to the original lecture video. Moreover, watching the produced lecture video may be more attractive than seeing the lecture content in class.	data compression;internet	Chia-Hu Chang;Yu-Tzu Lin;Ja-Ling Wu	2010	2010 Third IEEE International Conference on Digital Game and Intelligent Toy Enhanced Learning	10.1109/DIGITEL.2010.54	anime;games;intelligent network;the internet;simulation;visualization;computer science;speech;multimedia;adaptive learning;broadband networks;computer graphics (images)	Robotics	-69.8488787910317	-45.35121638350659	22141
16e692e563483fa737615c36402be3605f3c741e	student perspectives on mathematics in computer science		Mathematical competence is an important attribute for computer scientists, and mathematical courses are a core component of computing curricula. However, aspects of the role of mathematics, such as the importance of mathematical maturity and the relevance of calculus, have been debated for several decades. In addition, this discussion has focused on faculty and professional viewpoints. Student perceptions are noticeably absent. This paper describes an interview study conducted at a North American university that explores the perspectives of students on the role and importance of mathematics as well as the relationship between mathematics and computer science. Like the faculty, students voiced a range of viewpoints, and they selected courses based on their evolving beliefs. We found evidence that these course selections - and hence, the flexibility of the curriculum - helped to reinforce previously held beliefs about mathematics. The interviews also provided insight on the importance of career inclination on attitude toward the program and the curriculum's role in identity formation.	capability maturity model;computer science;interviews;relevance;requirement;theory	Nikki Sigurdson;Andrew Petersen	2017		10.1145/3141880.3141888	philosophy of mathematics education;everyday mathematics;pedagogy;curriculum;comprehensive school mathematics program;mathematical maturity;connected mathematics;reform mathematics;psychology;core-plus mathematics project	AI	-74.60650765635829	-32.30575438670942	22156

Design/methodology/approach – This study selects six digital libraries to represent a variety of digital libraries developed or sponsored by different types of organisations. The Help features of these selected digital libraries are examined by their types (explicit versus implicit), formats (texts, images, screenshots, multimedia materials, and interactive formats), and presentation styles (descriptive, guided, procedural, and exemplary). Findings – This study presents the types of Help features available in the selected digital libraries, and further characterises the formats and presentation styles of these Help features. In the process of analysis, the author also identifies six types of problems: lack of standards; tradeoff between using explicit Help and implicit help; tradeoff between using general Help versus specific Help; lack of interactive Help features; lack of dynamic presentation styles; and lack of Help features for advanced users and users who do not understand English. Research limitations/implications – In order to design Help features that facilitate users to effectively use digital libraries, further research needs to extend studies to what types of help-seeking situations users generally encounter and the corresponding support they need. Originality/value – This study provides insightful information regarding the current status and problems of the Help features in existing digital libraries.	browsing;digital library;email;entity;fits;information processing;librarian;library (computing);procedural programming;screenshot;x image extension	Hong Xie	2007	Online Information Review	10.1108/14684520710841810	standard-definition television;digital library;simulation;universal design;design methods;computer science;multimedia;world wide web;systems design	HCI	-72.64733335774851	-24.41627589344036	22166

0450c3fa0b91ccec39009ce1aa5b1c0d809d2e39	perceptions of player in game design literature	design process;game design	Few studies have examined the role of players in game design. The objective of this paper is to provide some clarity on the issue of player-centred design by analysing the notions on player in current game design literature. This research also discusses the potentials a multifaceted approach on players can offer for the design of games. The article starts by analysing different approaches on player from abstract ideal player to player profiles and players as co-creators. Later, the benefits of involving players in different phases of design process are examined. As a result the paper produces a grouping of different designer-player relationships that reflect the different design ideologies and traditions. This article contributes to the new field of game design research by producing clarity to some of the inarticulate and ambiguous issues related to the role of players in games and their design. At the same time, the analysis is relevant to the larger understanding of players as game cultural actors.	ambiguous grammar;mechatronics;video game design	Olli Sotamaa	2007			non-cooperative game;video game design;game design;simulation;simultaneous game;engineering;game mechanics;game art design;metagaming;repeated game;game developer;management science;multimedia;screening game;algorithmic game theory;game design document;sequential game;complete information	HCI	-62.958167604220705	-34.011193300948726	22216

Learners use a system to perform a learning task in the domain of history. They have to build a concept map containing a chronology using the system. To be able to support, we combined multiple semantic information sources and Wikipedia, for the natural language information, to create a semantic open learning space. The system provides advice by generating questions based on the semantic information and enhancing document based on the Wikipedia corresponding to the semantic information. All the advices are provided on demand and are generated depending on the learner’s concept map for adaptive support (question generation). The generated questions aim to lead the learners to new knowledge by deepening their understanding.	concept map;linked data;natural language;wikipedia	Corentin Jouault;Kazuhisa Seta	2013	I. J.

This article examines persuasive games through current trends in research as potential agents of social action. The implications of persuasive games for learning are analyzed through education and communication theories, suggesting that persuasive techniques are of primary importance and that procedures and ethos connect learners to experiences. The article first provides a historical overview of persuasive games, highlighting key background and influences. It then defines persuasive games through learning and communication theories, and discusses the implications of persuasive games as social action agents in research, policy, and practice.

In both environments, the presence of communication significantly and consistently improves public good contributions. However, the interaction between communication and visibility differs in the two environments. While the two dimensions are substitutes in the abstract computerized environment, they work in a complementary way to increase public goods contributions in the virtual world environment. Chat content analysis further shows that positive reinforcement and monitoring have a positive impact on cooperation, but dissent has a negative impact.	virtual world	Ernan Haruvy;Sherry Xin Li;Kevin McCabe;Peter Twieg	2017	Games and Economic Behavior	10.1016/j.geb.2017.08.002	visibility;dissent;economics;public good;metaverse;public relations;content analysis;reinforcement	HCI	-68.95085250765143	-47.20087594056716	22337

The students are able to use physical systems in a remote way, obtaining explanatory feedback on whether their actions are correct or incorrect. This service is based on system identification (SI) techniques to gain a knowledge of the physical system involved and case-based reasoning (CBR) for exploiting this knowledge. Uniting CBR and SI, an emulation of the real physical system is achieved that permits resolution of the problems of real-time access and simultaneous multiuser access that currently exist in remote-learning laboratories.	case-based reasoning;control engineering;emulator;multi-user;real-time clock;system identification;web service	Perfecto Reguera-Acevedo;Juan J.

In a web-based tutoring system, 208 middle school students either had to identify, explain, and correct errors made by a fictional student (erroneous examples group) or solve isomorphic versions of the problems with feedback (problem-solving group). Although the two groups did not differ significantly on an immediate posttest, students in the erroneous examples group performed significantly better on a delayed posttest administered one week later (d = .62). Students in the erroneous examples group also were more accurate at judging whether their posttest answers were correct (d = .49). Students in the problem-solving group reported higher satisfaction with the materials than those in the erroneous examples group, indicating that liking instructional materials does not equate to learning from them. Overall, practice in identifying, explaining, and correcting errors may help students process decimal problems at a deeper level, and thereby help them overcome misconceptions and build a lasting understanding of decimals. 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Every year the method is modified, based on teachers' experience and students' feedback [1]. Recently, the approach to e-assessment has been thoroughly revised, based on Bloom's taxonomy of students outcomes and Kolb's learning cycle [2,3]. In particular, the authors focused on the proper balance and order of the questions, corresponding to the lower level (knowledge, understanding) and the medium level (application, analysis) of Bloom's taxonomy. A new category of assessment, called “formative towards summative” (FTS) has been designed and introduced in the 2011/2012 autumn semester.	bloom's taxonomy;fleet telematics system;manycore processor;silesian library	Katarzyna Moscinska;Jerzy Rutkowski	2012	Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON)	10.1109/EDUCON.2012.6201136	mathematics education;simulation;engineering;artificial intelligence	DB	-80.21983461005661	-39.427882001730104	22448

In addition, it is studied whether reviews significantly contribute to these measures. The Control condition employs a tutorial with instructional features added to a dynamic task demonstration. The Review condition additionally includes video reviews. Participants were 55 seventh graders who viewed task demonstrations (and reviews) followed by practice. Both tutorials increased motivation (i.e., task relevance and self-efficacy) and performance. In addition, the Review condition had significantly better results for training time, self-efficacy and scores on an immediate post-test. Reviews have rarely been studied in dynamic visualizations. The present study suggests that there may be important advantages to be gained from concluding a demonstration video with a summary of the main points.	relevance	Hans van der Meij;Jan van der Meij	2016	J.

This system provides a mix of instruction and knowledge application scenarios to provide “intstructorless” training. After an initial assessment of student knowledge, each student is presented with customized multimedia instruction. This is followed by scenario-based knowledge application. During scenarios students are required to make decisions about SUAS employment in the context of either offensive or defensive operations. Each operation is divided into a planning, preparation, and execution phase. Each decision is linked to one of nine terminal learning objectives and contributes to the student model. Should evidence accumulate that the student requires remediation (because of poor decision making), instructional remediation is provided on the deficient knowledge. The student then restarts the particular phase of the scenario they were completing before. A unique aspect of this training is that it is designed to provide training across echelons of leaders involved in SUAS employment (company and below).	prototype;unmanned aerial vehicle	Paula J.

Relevant concepts extracted from domain ontology provide ontology-based browsing space that allows users to browse and select relevant terms of interest and increases the degree of relevancy. By using web services to integrate learning materials from heterogeneous public domain data sources, applications do not need to know the internal structure and working of public domain data sources, and reuse existing applications and recourses. We use Gene Ontology, PubMed eUtils and Google Web APIs to demonstrate our idea. The implementation involves techniques in image and video processing, database management, programming, and multimedia learning materials presentation.	browsing;database;gene ontology;need to know;ontology (information science);pubmed;relevance;video processing;web service	Aijuan Dong;Honglin Li	2005	The 2005 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence (WI'05)	10.1109/WI.2005.108	upper ontology;web service;public domain;the internet;association rule learning;bibliographic ontology;computer science;ontology;information integration;data mining;database;virtual reality;video processing;pattern;ontology-based data integration;world wide web;owl-s;information retrieval;process ontology;suggested upper merged ontology;virtual learning environment	DB	-82.89694484794099	-46.37494786077583	22589

Another section focuses on teaching IR aspects, like IR educational goals, assessment and feedback, and e-resources in LIS and in HS. Teaching in an academic environment for academic audiences is somehow different from teaching for professional audiences even though these are located in an academic environment as well.

As a mature program, NSDL has reached a point where it could either change direction or wind down. In this paper we argue there are reasons to continue the program and we outline several possible new program directions. These build on NSDL's learning platform, and they also look towards NSF's emerging interest in supporting work at the intersection of cyberinfrastructure and education. We consider NSDL's potential roles in several grand challenges that confront education, including: tailoring educational resources to students' needs, providing educators with a cyber-teaching environment, developing a cyber-workbench for researchers, and integrating education research and practice.	cyberinfrastructure;grand challenges;ibm notes;national science digital library;workbench	David J.

We explore the facilitation of creative collaborative activities, such as brainstorming, round-table discussions, and project work. This type of activities usually requires a large amount of media content to be displayed and available for modification in a shared space. We argue that 3D virtual worlds can be successfully used for facilitating such activities and can potentially be superior to the commonly used technologies, as they allow the sense of immersion close to reality and tools that might be even more convenient than in reality. The evaluation results demonstrate performance superiority of the method over those commonly used and the pedagogical value of the tool developed.	central processing unit;computer;design rationale;immersion (virtual reality);smoothing;sticky bit;stream processing;virtual world	Mikhail Morozov;Andrey Smorkalov;Mikhail Fominykh	2014	2014 IEEE 14th International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies	10.1109/ICALT.2014.200	collaborative learning;simulation;stream processing;media;human–computer interaction;computer science;virtual reality;multimedia;management;world wide web;collaboration	Visualization	-67.1675226502271	-41.879397003081934	22715

The growing use of ..m-iHm. .-sn..n..na +a,+, in ,k,e &&.a&rx sectoi WllCwz‘l ‘szqJ”ux LbaLU provides fertile domain areas for new and innovative applications of soft computing and expert systems technology. The main function of the expert firzzy classification scoring system is to support teachers in the evaluation of student writing samples by providing them with a uniform Eramework for generating ratings based on the consistent application of scoring rubrics. The system has been tested using actual student response data. A controlled experiment demonstrated that teachers using the expert fuzzy classification scoring system can make assessments in less time and with a level of accuracy comparable to the best teacher graders. The paper introduces frizzy classification techniques that can encapsulate knowledge about imprecise qmiiiies needed for cons~nct~g rn;e-‘ias& scorbg models that provide consistent, uniform scoring results.

It also seeks to focus on the potential challenges that the networked library faces in responding to massive needs of the researchers for digital content in different forms and formats. Design/methodology/approach – The author conducted a personal interview (face-to-face, and email communication) with 75 research faculties and postgraduate students in the colleges of business, engineering, IT, and sciences at the United Arab Emirates University (UAEU). The approach to design the conceptual model for the research-oriented library service was based on the feedback and observations of the interviewees on the pattern of query processing, research consultations (e.g. comprehensive, expert, topical search), e-resources coverage, and relevance of the returns to their queries and information needs. Findings – The proposed conceptual model demonstrates the virtual reference service, processing of research queries, online information search and retrieval, and data delivery to the researchers within a virtual research environment (VRE) in the UAEU. The study argues that the UAEU library should employ new strategies to meet the arising challenges of digital content and ongoing advances in information and communication technology (ICT), as well as considering how to embed itself within a research-intensive university. Research limitations/implications – The personal interview does not claim to be all-inclusive since the research faculties in the humanities and social studies were not reached. The inference of the study is encouraging the directors of the academic and research libraries to consider new models and strategies for providing reliable research-oriented information services for supporting the emerging paradigm of e-research activities. Practical implications – The study derived research-oriented service implications for the subject librarians to engage effectively with the research-devoted community either in the physical or in the virtual sphere, i.e. a two-faceted sphere. Originality/value – An extensive literature review revealed that there is a lack of scholarly works on research-oriented library services that are provided by the academic libraries at the UAE-based universities. The study is the first in the UAE to provide a broad understanding to an academic library in a research-intensive environment for adjusting its web-based information services. It presents also a suitable approach to embed librarians in the activities of the new paradigms of e-learning and e-science.	database;digital recording;e-science;email;faceted classification;information needs;librarian;library (computing);programming paradigm;relevance;web application	Ahmed Taha	2012	The Electronic Library	10.1108/02640471211282145	computer science;database;multimedia;management;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-73.70634676917831	-26.566167603406242	22763

There is much interest in laboratories and as with any “popular” pedagogical device there is the rush to adopt first and analyze later. Adding laboratories to a curriculum does not automatically make it a better program and, in fact, can make it worse if there is not a clear vision se to the goals that will be achieved by the addition. In this paper we will present a goal-oriented approach to the creation and implementation of laboratories in the undergraduate computer science curriculum. We will summarize a number of issues and concerns discussed during numerous workshop activities and will present ideas we have found successful in implementing closed labs at our respective universities. In the next section, a few terms will be defined. In section 3 we will discuss issues regarding the goals for closed labs and some of their implications. In section 4 we will discuss methods of evaluation and lastly, in section 5 guidelines for the development and implementation of these closed labs will be presented.	computer science	Brenda C.

The implementation of safe work in everyday practice is not easy, but possible. The OSH specialist plays a key role here, as changing workers’ attitudes and values is an effective way to improve safety at the workplace. The OSH specialist must have high professional qualifications, including social competence. He most often acts as a safety educator or safety instructor. The article presents results of the research conducted on a group of 215 workers. The workers underwent the obligatory OSH training, after which the increase of their knowledge was analysed. What is more, their subjective preferences as to the form of OSH training were later determined.	open-source hardware	Joanna Sadlowska-Wrzesinska;Izabela Gabryelewicz	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-21383-5_59	knowledge management	ML	-83.84932515412196	-28.522272969779223	22887

96e8260b58dfc98c3b17ac5e4d9c659cf9fcaed7	making the mission visible: altmetrics and nontraditional publishing		Purpose – Whereas traditional book and journal publishing remain the gold standard for many postsecondary institutions, nontraditional publishing is just as prolific at the flagship university in Maine. The university has strong land and sea grant missions that drive a broad research agenda, with an emphasis on community outreach and engagement. However, the impact of researchers’ contributions outside of academe is unlikely to be accurately reflected in promotion, tenure or review processes. Thus, the authors designed a series of altmetrics workshops aimed at seeding conversations around novel ways to track the impact of researchers’ diverse scholarly and creative outputs. Design/methodology/approach – This paper presents a case study of the instructional approach taken at the University of Maine library to facilitate discussions of alternative impact assessments that reach beyond traditional publications. Findings – Evaluations revealed an increased awareness of, and interest in, impact tracking tools that capture both traditional scholarship, like journal articles, and nontraditional scholarly and creative outputs, such as videos, podcasts and newsletters. The authors learned that altmetrics provides an entry point into a broader conversation about scholarly impact, and was best received by those whose scholarly output is not always captured by traditional metrics. Practical implications – Scholars are equipped with novel methods for describing the value of their work and discovering a broader audience for their research. Future initiatives will target the needs identified through initial conversations around altmetrics. Originality/value – Altmetrics workshops provide spaces to explore the potential for new tools that capture a range of previously unconsidered measures of impact, and to discuss the implications of those measures.	altmetrics;entry point;podcast	Jennifer L.

The learners joined the online Independent English Study Group (IESG) and worked both individually and collaboratively. This qualitative case study aims (a) to assess college-level ESL learners’ use of reading strategies for online second language (L2) texts and (b) to examine their use of hypertext and hypermedia resources while they read online L2 text. The seven strategies were (a) using hypermedia, (b) using computer applications and accessories, (c) dialoguing, (d) setting up reading purposes and planning, (e) previewing and determining what to read, (f) connecting prior knowledge and experiences with texts and tasks, and (g) inferring. The first two strategies were unique to online readings; the five remaining strategies apply to both online readings and paper-based text readings. The findings also revealed that “hybrid” online reading emphasized participants’ various reaction patterns and preferences in their hypermedia learning environments. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

785ce0326a1407ce3faf538bc17c78d1da68717e	an experience on applying software testing for teaching introductory programming courses		Previous work has demonstrated that the use of software testing concepts for teaching introductory programming courses may be a good practice for the students. Indeed, these courses provide limited opportunities for the teacher regarding dynamic activities that could help students in the learning process. This paper describes an approach in which test sets are reused in the context of teaching introductory programming courses, as an alternative to increase the quality of the programs generated by students. An experimental study was carried out to investigate the impact of reusing test cases during the programming learning. The objective is to evaluate if the use of test cases might improve the quality of programs implemented by the students. Sixty undergraduate students participated in the experiment, implementing programs in the domain of vectors. A set of reference programs was used to generate test cases, based on functional testing, to be reused by the students to test their programs. Considering a range of 1 − 10, the programs’ quality increased from 5.3 to 7.4 using this approach. The results provide evidences that the reuse of test cases during introductory programming courses may help to increase the quality of the programs generated by students, motivating them to apply software testing during the development of the programs.	experiment;functional testing;software testing;test case;vector graphics	Maria A.

For instance, the teacher repeatedly scolds the student for doing something incorrectly, but no one structured the classroom with procedures so the student would know what to responsibly do. The teacher threatens the class by instituting a disorganized environment, which the students do not trust. Students are motivated when they have a sense of control over their own lives. The classroom is organized and they know what to do. The students feel secure in an organized environment they can trust.

The major compromise of Learn&Web is the creation of an on line community, active, reflexive and ready to collaborate within an innovative way so that it becomes an useful, qualitative and adequate educational environment to the Brazilian reality and on a continuous improvement. Introduction The Internet with all its technologies on information, communication and cooperation provides great opportunities for the Education. The navigation through the Internet can promote the incidental learning which is quite advisable and useful but it is necessary and feasible to provide an organized environment where the learning process is not submitted to the contingencies of the fortuity. However, how to learn within an organized way not only the curriculum and extracurricular contents but also to develop cognitive meta-skills such as decision making, formulation of hypotheses, analysis, synthesis and evaluation? How to learn to interact, to communicate and to cooperate on distance? How to learn to participate as a contemporaneous citizen of a virtual community in the new Information Society? Some of such questions have already answers. During year 1998, it was developed an experimental and testing site, based on DCL Distance Cooperative Learning [1] that inspired the actual Learn@Web Project. Summary Environment Description Learn&Web is an integrated and opened environment for the cooperative learning and a space for the companionship and exchange of experiences where the knowledges can be shared among the peers in the socialhistorical-cultural Brazilian content. This environment is a place for the collective and cooperative work based in Vigotsky's social-historical-cultural theory [1], and has some goals: a) to apply the information, communication and cooperative technologies available in the Internet to the process of teaching and learning within a consistent and innovative way for both pedagogical and technological aspects, b) to develop courses on distance supported by the Internet, applying new methodologies of learning that meet different users, c) to create a Brazilian multicultural community whose interest is driven to the segment of the Internet in the Education, d) to create the culture of the collective and cooperative of the learning construction among the environment participants and e) to evaluate the results obtained during this process of teaching and learning. The environment follows a line of action, which concentrates its development in new paradigms addressed to the improvement of the Brazilian educational system. It also provides updating and improvement of first and second grades teachers of the public and private schools network that offers a renovation of curricular contents and pedagogical procedures such as courses of Education on distance and the use of the Internet resources and setting and diffusion of the tech-educational materials for the dichotic planning that support the docent practices linked to cooperative projects.

With the recent arising of software supporting collaboration between multiple users, it is obvious that usability testing will get more complex because of the multiplication of user interfaces and their physical distribution. The need for new usability testing methodologies and tools for their support under these circumstances is one consequence. This paper widens the methodologies of usability evaluation to computing systems supporting the solving of a collaborative work task. Additionally details of a distributed screen recording tool are described that can be used to support usability evaluation in a collaborative context.	usability	Florian Urmetzer;Vassil N.

The authors identified three problems exhibited by modern authoring tool software. The identified problems are proprietary architectures, instructional design theory neutrality, and monolithic structures. To begin solving these problems, software components were written in the Java programming language as Java Beans. The Java Beans conformed to the Java Bean component architecture specification. Instructional content was then captured and tagged utilizing eXtensible Markup Language (XML), which has recently been adopted by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) as an open Internet standard. Finally, to promote adherence to a particular instructional theory, the prototype components were based upon the knowledge representation scheme and instructional strategy prescriptions of Merrill’s instructional transaction theory. The focus of this paper is on applied technological solutions to overcome the limitations of current authoring environments. Technological solutions have been employed to meet larger goals of improved computer-based instruction. The implications for instruction resulting from this approach are that the original goals of instructional transaction theory can be met. These goals are to enable the development of a) more effective instruction, b) more efficient instruction, c) better instructional learning environments, and d) more adaptive instruction.		Thor A.

I present a framework, rooted in linguistics, that supports a clear distinction between content and expression of learning objects. The framework supports different types of content elements, and different expression elements in which content can be rendered, which include different expression media, multimedia components and spatial/temporal/hyperrelationships. I show what accessibility means in such a framework, and what the consequences of accessibility are in terms of automatic transformations of expression that can occur on student platforms. I argue that accessibility of learning objects, though making them multimodal, is not a satisfactory solution from the viewpoint of learning effectiveness. I claim that content modeling needs to be a crucial step in the development of any learning object, and propose notations based on conceptual maps and UML diagrams.	accessibility;diagram;management system;map;media pro;multimodal interaction;multimodal learning;unified modeling language	Giorgio Brajnik	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-73283-9_56	robot learning;algorithmic learning theory;simulation;computer science;knowledge management;multimedia;active learning	Web+IR	-82.62660972030959	-45.063861911440675	23843

The latter enables the knowledge reutilization in many learning  activities and scenarios constituting, as such, a collective memory of the community. The current work is based on two theoretical  foundations: the expressive capacity of ontologies, which offers a computer system new possibilities for using the knowledge  it contains and the Activity Theory (AT) framework, which permits describing and structuring collaborative learning scenarios.

A distinguishing feature of the creative sector is its make-up of practitioners from a broad spectrum of disciplines. In addition, creative processes often benefit from the collaboration of partners. Established models and challenges of creativity are assessed and contextualized against the contemporaneous creative industries, which feature multi-disciplinary teams, supported by current technology. Crowd-accelerated developments and creative collaboration via social media are having a transformative effect on the creation, distribution, and exhibition of creative works. They are also having an impact on traditional art and design processes. Multi-user interaction enables location-based art works to be transformed into new kinds of interactive and dynamic experiences for global viewers. Current opportunities, issues and challenges that arise are discussed, and a number of questions are identified for further discussion.	crowdfunding;crowdsourcing;high availability;hollywood;interaction;internet;location-based service;multi-user;social media;while	Stuart Cunningham;Dan Berry;Rae A.

20e522c1059d35ef30d0c72e7a09fdc9e06940dc	multi-view visualizations for emergency communities of volunteers	communities of volunteers;emergency management;visualization techniques;sense making;citizen participation	Information and communication technologies might empower emergency communities of volunteers by assisting community participation and improving their capacity to respond to unexpected events. However, designing technology for such purpose places unique visualization challenges that go beyond the current state of research on public participation tools and related technologies. Empowering these communities requires developing representations that enable collaborative reflection, promote mutual visibility of volunteers' efforts and sustain a shared view of the community. Similarly, it is necessary to envision visualizations that facilitate sense making of large, simultaneous and distributed pieces of heterogeneous information with different levels of credibility and priority. Accordingly, this paper identifies and characterizes these challenges to propose a multi-view and multi-abstraction-level visualization approach for emergency communities of volunteers. In particular, it combines time-oriented visualizations, space-filling visualization techniques, interaction mechanisms and coordinated maps to support community participation as well as collaborative and individual sense making. The application of these visualization techniques is discussed through the development of a set of design prototypes. We identify design challenges for assisting communities through visualization.We classify these challenges into community and sense-making issues.We design a set of prototypes to address such challenges.Our approach integrates large-scale data from different information sources.We propose a multi-view and multi-abstraction visualization approach.

The design builds on several intelligent tutoring design concepts, including graph-based knowledge representation, learner modeling, and adaptive learning content and assessment exposition. Specifically, we design a novel phased learner model approach to enable systematic exposure to words during vocabulary instruction. We also built an example application over the tutor platform that uses a learning activity involving videos and an assessment activity involving word to picture/image association. More importantly, the tutor adapts to the significant variation in children’s knowledge at the beginning of kindergarten, and evolves the application at the speed of each individual learner. A pilot study with 180 kindergarten learners allowed the tutor to collect various kinds of activity information suitable for insights and interventions both at an individualand class-level. The effort also demonstrates that we can do A/B testing for a variety of hypotheses at scale with such a framework.	a/b testing;algorithm;concept learning;experience;knowledge representation and reasoning;personalization;randomness;vocabulary	Ravi Kokku;Aditya Vempaty;Tamer Abuelsaad;Prasenjit Dey;Tammy Humphrey;Akimi Gibson;Jennifer Kotler	2018	CoRR		artificial intelligence;knowledge representation and reasoning;machine learning;computer science;graph;adaptive learning;vocabulary;tutor	HCI	-76.00536971623376	-46.861903737134774	24113
6064014439041cabd4088ea3cda7ac617453d522	computer animation as a vehicle for teaching computational thinking		Several platforms and programming languages exist nowadays designed and built to help educators introduce kids and youngsters into computational thinking. Some of them employ visual elements as the primary output of code in order to provide an immediate and engaging feedback for students. Computer animations, digital drawings and videogames are common products in these environments. With the rising popularity of animated films, children and teenagers may find more attractive to enroll in computer animation courses than in computer programming ones. Based in our own experience conducting computer animation workshops, we believe that this interest can be combined with the aforementioned introductory programming environments to introduce students to both computational thinking and computer animation as complementary subjects. In this paper we will present a general strategy to accomplish this based on what we call animation patterns.	computation;computational thinking;computer animation	Leonel Morales Díaz;Laura Sanely Gaytán-Lugo	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-44447-5_6	simulation;computer facial animation;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	Graphics	-68.4054377886401	-42.505644633602294	24136
9cb37137d03f104d97ff4e3f33671c076e60a5d4	investigating the impact of unsolicited next-step and subgoal hints on dropout in a logic proof tutor (abstract only)	data driven hints;intelligent tutor;dropout	We have been incrementally adding data-driven methods into the Deep Thought logic tutor for the purpose of creating a fully data-driven intelligent tutoring system. Our previous research has shown that the addition of data-driven hints, worked examples, and problem assignment can improve student performance and retention in the tutor. In this study, we investigate the influences two unsolicited hint types have on students' ability to complete the tutor. We have used data collected from two test conditions: one with unsolicited next step hints (NSH) presenting the immediate next step of a logic proof to a student's current proof-solving state, and the other with unsolicited subgoal hints (SGH) presenting a step of a logic proof two or three steps of the student's current state. Our results show that students who received unsolicited SGH had more interactions within the tutor and skipped more problems. Furthermore, the SGH group had a significantly higher dropout percentage. These results suggest that hint types can affect student behavior and the ability to learn the material. Therefore, determining what type of hint to give during problem solving is important to the learning process and should be taken into consideration when designing an intelligent tutoring system (ITS). Future work will include using historical student data to determine the best hint type to give a student by analyzing student behavior and identifying the most effective hint type for the behavior being exhibited.	deep thought (chess computer);dropout (neural networks);interaction;problem solving;slow-growing hierarchy;subgoal labeling	Christa Cody;Behrooz Mostafavi	2017		10.1145/3017680.3022426	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;multimedia;pedagogy	AI	-75.3979982462095	-46.87213356350801	24156

To solve the problem, we propose a tabletop projection system with special software which displays synchronized explanation texts which is prepared in advance. With this system, the teacher can project text information just besides operation area on the table. To control the timing of changing those texts, the teacher use foot pedals. Hearing impaired students’ answers for questionnaires after a practical lesson of Manga drawing with proposed system showed that it was useful for such a lesson.

The goal of the paper is not to do an exhaustive survey of NoSQL systems. The aim is to do a broad brush analysis of what these developments mean - the good and the bad aspects! Based on my more than three decades of database systems work in the research and product arenas, I will outline what are many of the pitfalls to avoid since there is currently a mad rush to develop and adopt a plethora of NoSQL systems in a segment of the IT population, including the research community. In rushing to develop these systems to overcome some of the shortcomings of the relational systems, many good principles of the latter, which go beyond the relational model and the SQL language, have been left by the wayside. Now many of the features that were initially discarded as unnecessary in the NoSQL systems are being brought in, but unfortunately in ad hoc ways. Hopefully, the lessons learnt over three decades with relational and other systems would not go to waste and we wouldn't let history repeat itself with respect to simple minded approaches leading to enormous pain later on for developers as well as users of the NoSQL systems!  Caveat: What I express in this paper are my personal opinions and they do not necessarily reflect the opinions of my employer.	database;goto;hoc (programming language);hoopla (digital media service);nosql;relational model;sql	C.

76f374a7fda6d84e5021ac690426ed84aaa04d0c	digital game-based second-language vocabulary learning and conditions of research designs: a meta-analysis study		Abstract Second language (L2) vocabulary learning has been deemed a daunting task for many students. This meta-analysis study aimed to explore the effectiveness of applying digital games for L2 vocabulary learning. A total of 26 published studies (2001–2017) conformed with the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Due to diverse findings of previous meta-analysis research in the field, we propose a framework of four-condition research designs to differentiate the empirical studies in an attempt to disclose possible expositions for the diversity and to connect the specific learning mechanisms with the research evidence. The overall effect sizes of the studies in the four conditions are reported as follows: A large overall effect size for Condition 1 (10 studies) (experimental groups playing digital games versus control groups receiving alternative activities), medium for Condition 2 (experimental groups playing digital games with a feature added or changed versus control groups playing base-version games) (10 studies), medium to large for Condition 3 (experimental groups playing digital games and control/comparison groups receiving identical content via conventional means) (two studies), and non-significant for Condition 4 (all participants playing the same digital games but being grouped by a non-game related variable) (four studies). Next, a structure diagram is developed in which the four conditions of the research design are connected with their respective game-related factors based on their locality. Further, we conducted moderator analyses to examine how the eight potential moderator variables (game design, educational level, L2 proficiency level, linguistic distance, intervention setting, assessment type, game source and intervention length) influenced the effect sizes in Conditions 1 and 2 to illustrate various digital game-based L2 vocabulary learning scenarios. Finally, suggestions and implications are provided for game designers, educational practitioners, and researchers in the field.	vocabulary	Yu-Ling Tsai;Chin-Chung Tsai	2018	Computers & Education	10.1016/j.compedu.2018.06.020	computer science;knowledge management;natural language processing;empirical research;meta-analysis;research design;locality;moderation;linguistic distance;game design;artificial intelligence;vocabulary	HCI	-73.92215244904942	-43.81925448212368	24304
bc6c9cb1a81613384eef01dad4988c61c86666a3	monitoring an oop course through assignments in a distributed pair programming system		Distributed Pair Programming (DPP) is widely known to promote collaboration and knowledge sharing among novice programmers, while it engages them in carrying out programming assignments. Moreover, DPP is a means of experiencing agile software development techniques that are considered important in the software market. In this paper, we share some experiences on using the DPP system of SCEPPSys for carrying out assignments in an undergraduate Object Oriented Programming (OOP) course. Specifically, we focus on the information recorded during problem solving and the statistics reported by the system and how this information can be utilized for monitoring both the course regarding the fulfillment of its goals and the programming habits and progress of students. Some proposals are made towards extending the possibilities of SCEPPSys for generating automatically more sophisticated reports that would support instructors in more successfully monitoring a course and students. The ultimate goal of such an enhanced monitoring is to improve students’ software quality.	agile software development;automatic programming;digital photo professional (dpp);java;online and offline;pair programming;problem solving;programmer;sensor;software development process;software metric;software quality	Stelios Xinogalos;Maria Satratzemi;Despina Tsompanoudi;Alexander Chatzigeorgiou	2016			programming language;pair programming;computer engineering;object-oriented programming;computer science	PL	-82.77981822874594	-35.32434833434341	24378

The structure can be profitably utilized to monitor the evolution of mental states in order to suit the resources and the didactic strategies to the user's needs. The problem of building a user model is favourably affected by our approach: in fact the huge quantities of data present in overlay and bug catalogue models are no longer required. The fuzzy structure allows to monitor the cognitive variables that are necessary to design a user model that can operate in a way independent from the particular topic to be taught.	user modeling	Luigi Di Lascio;Antonio Gisolfi;Vincenzo Loia	1998	Inf.

The objectives were to investigate the use of the model with an early-childhood population and to understand how digital and information literacy evolves in best practices for implementing problem-based learning as informed by I-LEARN. Analysis revealed that teachers adjusted their implementation of I-LEARN’s steps to meet students’ needs and to mesh with their own styles. Students were able to build new knowledge and enjoyed learning a variety of ways to acquire information. The model made the idea of research concrete and helped learners focus on specific tasks and accomplishments. Teachers’ technological/pedagogical knowledge grew, and teachers concluded that students’ projects were successful and that they overcame a lack of computer experience to focus on finding and analyzing sources and reflecting on their learning.	scikit-learn	Mary Jean Tecce DeCarlo;Annette Grant;Vera J.

60f1d06a1fc965b9eefe3f39bb91a3a9a53d983e	flipping a graduate-level software engineering foundations course		Creating a graduate-level software engineering breadth course is challenging. The scope is wide. Students prefer hands-on work over theory. Industry increasingly values soft skills. Changing software technology requires the syllabus to be technology-agnostic, yet abstracting away technology compromises realism. Instructors must balance scope with depth of learning. At Carnegie Mellon University, we designed a flipped-classroom course that tackles these tradeoffs. The course has been offered since Fall 2014 in the Silicon Valley campus. In this paper, we describe the course's key features and summarize our experiences and lessons learned while designing, teaching, and maintaining it. We found that the pure flipped-classroom format was not optimal in ensuring sufficient transfer of knowledge, especially in remote settings. We initially underestimated teaching assistantship resources. We gradually complemented video lectures and hands-on live sessions with additional live components: easily replaceable recitations that focus on current technology and mini lectures that address application of theory and common wisdom. We also provided the students with more opportunities to share their successes and experiments with their peers. We achieved scalability by increasing the number of teaching assistants, paying attention to teaching assistant recruitment, and fostering a culture of mentoring among the teaching team.	experience;experiment;google classroom;hands-on computing;scalability;software engineering	Hakan Erdogmus;Cécile Péraire	2017	2017 IEEE/ACM 39th International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering Education and Training Track (ICSE-SEET)	10.1109/ICSE-SEET.2017.20	simulation;computer science;engineering;knowledge management;software engineering;multimedia;management	SE	-80.16334555981736	-31.783255147242023	24498

Out goes ICT and how to use Microsoft Office; in comes coding and computer science. Assessment has a crucial role to play in this revolution. If teachers use low-quality assessment instruments we will end-up teaching the wrong subject; and viceversa. This paper reviews the state of the field, and makes concrete, achievable proposals for developing shared, high quality assessments for computer science. Central to this proposal is the collaborative platform VIVA (the Vilnius collaboratively coded and Validated computer science questions/tasks for Assess- ment). Two requirements are key to VIVA: 1) support for multiple competency frameworks, so that the contributors can meta-tag resources with respect to the framework they are most familiar with; and 2) support for crowdsourcing the validation of each question/task and its mapping to competencies. The use of a taxonomy of questions/tasks type that has been mapped to computational thinking concepts and to a competency framework is proposed. Some seed questions are already available in the online platform prototype, and various supporters have granted permission to use large questions banks. The design requirements of a full implementation of the VIVA platform for a modern and effective approach to assessment including support for digital badges, are outlined; and some preliminary results from a survey administered to the initial contributors to VIVA are presented.	co-ment;computation;computational thinking;computer science;crowdsourcing;display resolution;meta element;mozilla's open badges project;prototype;requirement;taxonomy (general)	Daniela Giordano;Francesco Maiorana;Andrew Paul Csizmadia;Simon Marsden;Charles Riedesel;Shitanshu Mishra;Lina Vinikiene	2015		10.1145/2858796.2858801	question;simulation;computer science;knowledge management;software engineering;multimedia;lifelong learning;management;metadata;world wide web;crowdsourcing;educational assessment;pedagogy	Logic	-78.16812823390924	-35.18583469502848	24606

Overall, 773 needs were elicited, proving that students had refined views about the elements that can render the next wave of e-learning applications successful. They convincingly demonstrated their web 2.0 mentality but sought for a smooth transition to the new environment, promoting an evolution rather than a revolution. The resulting set of needs demarcates a zone of expectancies where the enhancement of the learning content and the contextualization of knowledge remain top priorities with revamped opportunities, while networking, participation and collaboration complement and improve their characteristics. Our study is an example of exploiting participatory design for exposing students’ thoughts and requirements from a critical design perspective.	informatics;requirement;requirements elicitation;situated;web 2.0	George Palaigeorgiou;George Triantafyllakos;Avgoustos A.

An n-gram analysis is used to model the learning behavior from learning action streams. The regular and irregular learning behavior patterns are obtained from the n-gram analysis model. Then, the n-gram models are clustered into a hierarchy. The hierarchical pattern can be used to improve the domain knowledge of an ITS in predicting student's actions, sequencing problems to be solved, and adjusting hint mechanisms. Our approach is domain independent and able to manage learning behavior uncertainties.	n-gram	Sumalee Sonamthiang;Nick Cercone;Kanlaya Naruedomkul	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Granular Computing (GRC 2007)	10.1109/GrC.2007.114	domain knowledge;machine learning;streams;natural language processing;artificial intelligence;intelligent tutoring system;hierarchy;computer science;conceptual clustering;rough set	Robotics	-77.27570669862934	-49.6055136464248	24655

Access to education is going to become crucial for the success of our information society. Therefore a lot of potential is seen in distance learning and distributed virtual environments. The communicative character of the distributed virtual environments would allow for students and stuff to meet in social shared spaces and engage in on-line real-time seminars and tutorials. Such technologies may mitigate some of the problems of isolation that distance learning brings. This paper presents multiuser distributed virtual environments, which are designed and implemented for educational uses.	multi-user;online and offline;real-time locating system;virtual reality	Christos Bouras;Alexandros Philopoulos;Thrasyvoulos Tsiatsos	2000			educational technology;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;instructional simulation;multimedia;virtual learning environment	Graphics	-70.0866355350053	-37.17454588518277	24663

On-line learning networks create value through the combination of content and people’s knowledge. They can vary widely in the strength and permanence of their connections and the resources necessary to maintain them. Aspects of both a pragmatic and social nature need to be carefully considered in the process of initiation of on-line learning communities. This paper considers learning networks from the perspective of the potential they offer to the strengthening of relationships among institutions, groups, and people sharing a common interest in computer-enhanced learning. Some case studies are analysed and an analytical framework is sketched out to guide observations and to provide a lens through which case studies can be interpreted. The final goal is to delineate a reference for identifying strong and weak elements in virtual networks and to examine under what conditions they are succeeding. In addition, some possible scenarios for on-line networks are delineated along two main lines: the organisation and structure of the network and its level of establishment.	computer-mediated communication;emergence;interaction;list of code lyoko episodes;online and offline;online community;online machine learning;spontaneous order	Rosa Maria Bottino	2007	Education and Information Technologies	10.1007/s10639-007-9030-z	social relation;cooperative learning;error-driven learning;social learning;social science;evolving networks;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;inductive transfer;sociology;active learning;communication;management;world wide web;open learning;synchronous learning	Web+IR	-66.06870292880409	-34.14107322706882	24735

This paper argues that examining tutoring techniques in a community computer training centre is useful to discovering why they will persist with learning. Using a Grounded Theory study design, the theory that emerged that accounted for continuance was the tutoring practices and the relationships that were built between tutor and learner. Examples from the data are presented to support the findings that link certain ways of practicing computer tutoring with repeat lesson attendance. This paper contributes to understanding the types of tutoring practices that can encourage older learners to continue the learning journey in later life. In turn, this assists with overcoming the digital divide older learners not skilled in computer use experience and allows them to participate in an increasing technologically driven society.

Support is needed to acquire a basic or rough idea of community opinions quickly. In this paper, the authors show how to elicit main points from community opinions with a simple word association test on college students about the highlighted social events in China in 2010. Two supporting technologies for qualitative meta-synthesis CorMap and iView are applied to analyze the opinions. Unlike basic descriptive statistical figures, CorMap/ iView help identify the structures of opinions, which show the primary concerns of students or features of events, as a simple way to acquire a rough synthesis of public concerns rapidly. about H1N1 flu and accurately follow real-time disease activity (Savage, 2011) after using Google search query to predict flu outbreaks (Ginsberg, et al. 2009) Local social events spread widely as those new on-line social media become so popular. In China, public opinions expressed via Internet are more of governmental and business concerns for different missions. It becomes a necessity to face the community opinions about the social events and response with proper actions to avoid worse situations for governmental officials at different levels in China.

There are obvious difference between their cognition of risk and those from other groups by both age and profession (Tang, 2009). Their concerns reflect their cognition and responses toward those social events, if captured correctly in time may be helpful to make reasonable and timely interventions for better management and healthy growth of the youth. How to acquire a basic or rough image toward the college students’ opinions is an important issue even quickly collecting those opinions is quite easy. Qualitative research taken in social and psychological studies analyzes the first-hand materials based on hypothesis, and conclusions may be affected by the experiences and judgments of the researchers. Rather than beginning with a hypothesis, grounded theory (GT), proposed by Glaser and Strauss in 1960s, investigates the actualities in the real world and analyses the data with no preconceived hypothesis. “GT data analysis involves searching out the concepts behind the actualities by looking for codes, then concepts and finally categories” (Allan, 2003). Grounded theory aims to generate theory from data, which may show a systemic vision toward the concerned problem and helpful for problem solving. Even with software, the process mainly relies on the analysts and is time consuming, which then has limitation to emergency response. Computerized support is needed not only for storing the results of each phase during the GT working process, but also better to help analysts generate concepts and categories. If we understand the process of grounded theory is a kind of qualitative metasynthesis, we apply computing technologies to implement qualitative meta-synthesis to achieve the systemic vision of the concerned problem. In this paper, we show how to elicit main points from community opinions with a simple word association test about the highlighted social events in or relevant to China among college students in 2010. We select “Expo 2010” and “Foxconn Suicides” and collect relevant associated words from both college students and graduates. With collection of those students’ quick thoughts toward those events, we apply two supporting technologies for qualitative meta-synthesis CorMap and iView to the analysis of their opinions toward two social events. Unlike basic descriptive figures from those opinions, we conduct exploratory analysis by CorMap/iView to identify the structures of opinions, which may show the primary concerns of students or features of events, just a simple way to acquire an image of public concerns rapidly during qualitative research. At first, we introduce the supporting technologies for qualitative meta-synthesis. 2. QUALITATIVE META-SYNTHESIS SUPPORTING TECHNOLOGIES: CORMAP/IVIEW Qualitative meta-synthesis is one type of meta-synthesis, which refers to either a system approach toward complex problem solving proposed by Chinese system scientist Qian Xuesen and his colleagues over 20 years ago (Qian, Yu, & Dai, 1990) or the results of metasynthesis system practice. Another two types of meta-synthesis denote qualitative-quantitative meta-synthesis and meta-synthesis from qualitative understanding to quantitative validation, which actually indicates a working process of MSA to complex problem solving. Gu and Tang (2005) discussed how to achieve three types of meta-synthesis by a synchronous-asynchronous-synchronous process while each type of meta-synthesis can be achieved at the respective phase. Activities held in Synchronous Stage I denote to achieve qualitative meta-synthesis, i.e., perspective development or hypothesis generation for metasynthetic systems modeling. Divergent group thinking is the main way at that stage. Methods oriented to acquire constructs or ideas toward the concerned problems are regarded as qualitative meta-synthesis methods. Then many methods for a systemic vision of the concerned problem can fulfill qualitative meta-synthesis, such as 14 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the """"Add to Cart"""" button on the product's webpage: www.igi-global.com/article/understanding-college-studentsthought-toward/60752?camid=4v1 This title is available in InfoSci-Journals, InfoSci-Journal Disciplines Computer Science, Security, and Information Technology, InfoSci-Artificial Intelligence and Smart Computing eJournal Collection, InfoSci-Management Science and Organizational Research eJournal Collection, InfoSci-Journal Disciplines Business, Administration, and Management, InfoSci-Select.

This paper makes the case that the wiki has several properties that are particularly amenable for constructing applications that support the “collaborative” part of a variety and range of different time/different place student collaborations. In support of the argument, the paper presents the WikiDesignPlatform (WDP). The WDP supplies a suite of awareness, navigation, communication, transcription, and analysis components that provide additional functionality beyond the standard wiki feature set. Two case studies are presented, which have different coordination, communication, and awareness requirements for the “collaborative” part of the students’ collaborative learning activities. The evidence shows that under both conditions, a prefabricated wiki provides a sufficiently rich intersubjective space that adequately supports the students’ collaborative work.	awareness;intersubjectivity;requirement;transcription (software);wiki	Johann Ari Larusson;Richard Alterman	2009	I.

In our research we adopted the Human Centered Approach to design a cognitive rehabilitation platform that is able to provide tools and features tailored to the professional needs and strategies and also able to engage patients in their treatment process. In order to explore the cliniciansu0027 point of view on the neuropsychological intervention strategies, we applied two different techniques often used in human factors research: the Critical Decision Method to study professionalsu0027 strategies with a descriptive perspective, and the Hierarchical Task Analysis to analyze the processes with a normative view. The results of our research showed that the hybrid approach adopted allowed us to have a better focus on the cognitive rehabilitation process and on the professionalsu0027 decision making mechanism. This led to a better understanding of functional requirements for supporting clinicianu0027s strategic decision making, in terms of personalization of treatments, cognitive exercises settings and feedback customization. In conclusion, our research highlights the value of the CDM to focus deeply on which functionalities professionals require from a cognitive telerehabilitation system and allowed us to design more precisely clinician-patients interactions inside the system compared to prescriptive methods currently used. Our study offers contribution to the comprehension of the rehabilitation processes, suggesting the positive impacts of an “extended” clinic treatment by adopting a flexible and adaptable tool.

The study described in this paper takes a step towards filling this gap by introducing an evidence-based approach for deriving adaptive interaction techniques. In a dialogue experiment with 36 dyads of computer experts and laypersons, we observed how experts tailored their written explanations to laypersons’ communicational needs. To support adaptation, the experts in the experimental condition were provided with information about the layperson’s knowledge level. In the control condition, the experts had no available information. During the composition of their answers, the experts in both conditions articulated their planning activities. Compared with the control condition, the experts in the experimental condition made a greater attempt to form a mental model about the layperson’s knowledge. As a result, they varied the type and proportion of the information they provided depending on the layperson’s individual knowledge level. Accordingly, such adaptive explanations helped laypersons reduce comprehension breakdowns and acquire new knowledge. These results provide evidence for theoretical assumptions regarding cognitive processes in text production and conversation. They empirically ground and advance techniques for adaptation of content in adaptive hypermedia systems. They are suggestive of ways in which explanations in recommender and decision support systems could be effectively adapted to the user’s knowledge background and goals.	adaptive hypermedia;cognition;decision support system;interaction technique;knowledge level;list comprehension;mental model;personalization;recommender system	Matthias Nückles;Alexandra Winter;Jörg Wittwer;Markus Herbert;Sandra Hübner	2006	User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction	10.1007/s11257-006-9000-y	cognition;decision support system;human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;machine learning;asynchronous communication;multimedia;world wide web;interaction technique;recommender system	HCI	-72.51169142712897	-45.834556272307665	24906

Recent research indicated that students rely on social media for educational purposes like social networking, chatting, and knowledge sharing. With social media aiding learning experiences, m-learning is anticipated to improve the application of social media. In the paper, we investigated the preference of social media tools and mobile devices for learning, their benefits and effectiveness, and how they can possibly improve learning process in Nigeria. Furthermore, we evaluated learning experiences of students using Edmodo social media-based learning environment in a Nigerian university. We used a mixed method research approach, where the data was triangulated from two questionnaires and students’ interviews. Data gathered after the course shows that students learning response was improved. Students were eager to use mobile devices for accessing social media sites, thus providing experimental evidence of the place of social media in m-learning.	experience;experiment;mobile device;social media	Solomon Sunday Oyelere;Vasileios Paliktzoglou;Jarkko Suhonen	2016	IJSMILE	10.1504/IJSMILE.2016.075055	psychology;cooperative learning;educational technology;knowledge management;multimedia;active learning;open learning;synchronous learning;pedagogy	HCI	-74.4608448909296	-40.13390634683028	24971

It has a well-developed infrastructure for the preparation of quality print and multimedia learning materials. A symposium and working conference linking twelve sites, including Auckland NZ via video conferencing, and supported by print based materials and web based conferencing was held during November 1998 with the assistance of Telstra's Conferlink. This paper provides the background, organisation, and evaluation results. Our conclusions are that appropriate use of a combination of print based materials, videoconferencing and a web based classroom works well for the provision of continuing education to health professionals. In addition this symposium was able to reach clinicians and demonstrate the value of informatics to support evidence based practice.	conferences;education, continuing;informatics (discipline);multimedia;numerous	Evelyn J.

Because the educational process affects people, in this field, quality is more important than in any other economic or industrial process. The way educational processes have been conducted has been evolving by implementing new techniques and methods, concepts from other fields, like psychology, and in the last decades, technology. The rapid evolution of mobile technologies and devices, and also its impact on daily activities of young people, has been seen as a new way to deliver knowledge and to assist the educational process. Because the quality of the educational process depends also on the quality of methods used to deliver knowledge, it is important to evaluate the quality of M-Learning applications.  The paper continues previous presented work by defining a validation model for a proposed multi-criteria quality model used to evaluate M-Learning applications. The paper describes the proposed quality model and a validation process that is used to evaluate the representativeness of results. Because these results measure the quality of the analyzed M-Learning applications, it is important to test the model.

Our context is My Reviewers, a suite of web-based tools designed to facilitate document markup, team projects, peer review, e-portfolio review, and writing-program assessment. Since 2009, WPAs (Writing Program Administrators) at USF (University of South Florida) have been collaborating with instructors at USF as well as with WPAs and instructors at other colleges and universities to develop My Reviewers.  To illustrate our development and usability processes and to highlight the benefits of working with diverse institutions, we provide a case study of a USF and University of Pennsylvania collaboration to develop e-portfolio tools. We conclude by noting ways our usability processes have matured along with the tool, including adoption of more traditional SCRUM methods and Microsoft Team Foundation Server.	atari portfolio;crowdsourcing;markup language;scrum (software development);team foundation server;usability;web application	Cassandra Branham;Joe Moxley;Val Ross	2015		10.1145/2775441.2775482	project management;web usability;user experience design;usability;human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;software engineering;usability engineering;management;world wide web	HCI	-70.89396921424385	-33.26552399543959	25062

In a reported case-study, the student's mental models are inferred from questionnaires and interviews collected during a sequence of teaching sessions. These putative cognitive models are based on a theory of knowledge representation, derived from psychological results and educational studies, which accounts for the evolution of the student's knowledge over a learning period. The learning system WHY, able to handle (causal) domain knowledge, shows how to model the answers and the causal explanations given by the learner.	causal filter;causal system;causality;cognitive model;cognitive science;computation;heuristic;interactivity;interdependence;knowledge representation and reasoning;machine learning;mental model;prospective search;simulation;subject-matter expert;theory	Filippo Neri	2000	Machine Learning	10.1023/A:1007642225146	knowledge representation and reasoning;cognitive model;causal reasoning;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;body of knowledge;machine learning;domain knowledge	AI	-77.28509590804504	-46.94217353900274	25090

However, the scientific output underwent stagnation and even decline in the mid-2000s relegating Morocco to the last rank of the Maghreb countries. Analysis of the effects of several major governmental decisions taken in the 2000s, shows a clear impact on research activity. The major decisions that have had the most important negative impact are: (1) the use of different scientific languages in schools and universities, (2) abolition of the State Doctorate, (3) the promotion system of professors, (4) the complex bureaucracy of project management, (5) the Voluntary Departure initiative, (6) administrative equivalence of Master and PhD, (7) teaching pressure in universities, (8) ageing of professors and supporting administrative personnel, (9) preference given to expertise over research activity, (10) fled of PhD students.	addendum;bureaucracy;computer science;diploma;emoticon;tree accumulation;turing completeness;video synopsis	Fida Medina	2015	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-015-1701-8	development economics;scientific method;epistemology;economic growth	HPC	-79.53307720477295	-26.259483259853234	25113

Such behaviour in students could be classified as a reaction to alien and counter-intuitive knowledge, as described in the works of Meyer and Land on threshold concepts. Since the threshold concept is, itself, a product of educational research, we would expect to have difficulty in explaining this concept to our colleagues. This is one possible explanation for the relatively slow penetration of computer science specific educational theory into modern computer science teaching practice. In this paper we examine the application of the threshold concept theory to the whole of our field of education, using the literature to find examples of how troublesome knowledge does, or does not, spread throughout the academic community. We track the adoption and display of knowledge of key concepts in Computer Science educational research, in order to identify common patterns in adoption and, by providing models to explain the flow of information across our discipline, provide an early indication of the role that threshold concepts (as a barrier to understanding) are playing in the community.	alien;computer science;faceted classification	Nickolas J.

The objective of this research-in-progress is to explore the effects of two such factors, i.e., IT skills Self-efficacy (SE) and IT Skills Importance, on students’ attraction to IT careers. A survey methodology was used to achieve the aforementioned objective. Undergraduate students enrolled in IT courses at two large U.S. public universities were surveyed. This study makes a contribution to the field of IT education in multiple ways. First it develops scales for two beliefs which are crucial in capturing students’ attraction to IT careers. Second, it provides insights into students’ perceptions regarding the importance of various IT skills. Third, it posits a preliminary model which helps in our understanding of how students’ personal perceptions regarding the importance of IT skills affect SE beliefs and career intentions.		Kshiti D.

A review of the literature provides clues to designing a more usable interface and navigation structure that both aides and engages learners. A look at the past and future of interface design allows designers to glean valuable information and ideas for improving the usability, as well as the educational value, of their products. Concentrating on simplicity and consistency, and keeping flashy design and color to a minimum, designers can create attractive products that promote learning.	human–computer interaction;prospective search;usability;web design	Christopher D.

However, their educational power is high if designed properly. It is therefore of increasing importance to establish animations with optimal instructional design properties. Commercial e-learning tools show an enhanced tendency to incorporate 3D-animations although their production is rather costly as compared to the productions of 2D-animations. Until now, producing state of the art 3Danimations requires complex and expensive software tools and specialized trained people. The creation of 2D-animations is relatively easy and can be achieved by the use of less expensive and therefore more widespread software tools. The present study investigates in an empirical setting instructional design properties of 2D and 3D-animations by comparing students learning efficiency while working with a 2D and a 3D-animation about the biomolecule ATP-Synthase. Both animations were produced in order to ensure an equality of the content delivered within the animation. The animations were presented via video projector to 188 students of biology. Due to pre-test results students were identified as having high or low prior domain specific knowledge. A post-test revealed that students with high prior knowledge gained from watching a 2D-animation while students with low prior knowledge performed equal with the 2D and the 3D-animation. Implications for instructional design properties of animations are given.	automated theorem proving;computer animation;flash animation;video projector	Thomas Huk;Mattias Steinke;Christian Floto	2003			simulation;computer facial animation;computer science;knowledge management;instructional simulation;multimedia	HCI	-69.28420216529081	-43.09596644427568	25277

The implementation of such architectures are time-consuming and are generally not interoperable with other domains [3]. The presented research describes the experimentation of a Open Source, LMS enhanced with elements of AI aiming at supporting online teachers’ and tutors’ work by using a KB specific to relational and pedagogical aspects, not connected to a specific subject matter. Such implementation needs to be provided of an authoring tool easily and readily usable by tutors and teachers of different subjects and with medium level IT training. Starting point of our investigation has been a preliminary analysis of machine-mediated, human-human interactions (MM-HHI) and communications by using the Teachers’ thinking approach [4] [5] [6]. We considered messages exchanged between teachers/tutors and online students in three post-graduate, online courses running at the University of Macerata during 2008 – 2010 by the Faculty of Education. The study showed that about 30% of messages concerned structured information that could be straightforwardly retrieved by an artificial agent; almost all remaining messages were instead deeply bound to student’s learning path or required a significant input by the teacher/tutor, while the residual part of messages could – to some extents – be delegated to an intelligent agent having access to students’ tracking data in order to display visual information to users or trigger alarms to tutors. The investigation carried out prompted us for the deployment of an Open Source chat-bot system that would retrieve information already coded into the courses or originated by students through the analysis of their activity logs; the chat-bot agent uses this structured information in order to answer students’ most common questions hence relieving teachers and tutors from doing this repetitive task. The system is being implemented on a OLAT ver. 6.3 LMS loosely coupled to a JADE-based Multi Agent System in charge of processing user tracking data and running the ALICE chat-bot integrated with the platform messaging system.	alice;artificial intelligence;intelligent agent;inter-process communication;interaction;interoperability;jade;kilobyte;loose coupling;multi-agent system;olat;software deployment;subject matter expert turing test;ver (command)	Pier Giuseppe Rossi;Simone Carletti	2011		10.1016/j.procs.2010.12.135	interpersonal relationship;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;machine learning;data mining;multimedia;programming language;world wide web;intelligent agent	AI	-80.86403849802672	-47.23646801258411	25292

Until this time, the profession has subscribed to a limited view of computers and their effects on writing — a view circumscribed by the paradigms of other disciplines or by our own past experiences with teaching machines and paper-and-pencil composing. These visions are not capable of accommodating the larger and more radical changes wrought by the electronic medium we are now using. By subscribing to them, English teachers may, as Coleridge says, have created a “tacit compact” not to pass beyond a certain limit in speculating about computers. This paper suggests four overlapping areas of exploration, four points of departure that might help us spark creative re-formations of our thinking about computers and their relationship to writing: 1.) Computers and teaching writing, 2.) Computers and language theory, 3.) Computers and learning from the past, 4.) Computer research in other fields.	computers and writing;type conversion	Cynthia L.

In particular, we highlight a series of misunderstandings of object-oriented (OO) concepts we observed as a by-product of the code review exercise. In our activity, we asked students to review code, rate it using a rubric, and to justify their explanation. The students were asked to review two solutions to a project from a previous year. Through examples of their explanations, we found that students had a number of basic misunderstandings of object-oriented principles. In this paper, we present our observations of the misunderstandings, and present some general observations of how code reviews can be used as an assessment tool in CS2.	code rate	Scott A.

Such analysis considers didactic materials as the conjunction of contents and instructional design used to guide learning and teaching processes. And we examine why several features such as reusability, semantic interoperability and collaboration support must be ensured from the earlier stages of the material creation process. For those reasons didactic material development is not a trivial task and demands of a development methodology support and a high-quality authoring environment. We describe how the MD2 research project provides an integrated solution for creation of didactic materials that take into account those rationales.

Online activities, such as e-commerce, social interaction, etc., have drawn increasing attentions in regard to the provision of personalized services which require best and comprehensive understanding of users. As an approach, this study outlines a general framework based on human (or consumer) contexts for the discovery and creation of business intelligence. Three major portions are discussed. First, the collection of human contexts, including activity logs in both cyber and physical worlds, is modeled. Second, data analysis was performed via proposed mining algorithms that concern potential fusion at different levels according to situations and ultimate purposes. Third, sustenance of developed model is then concentrated. An open platform was developed to support the evolutionary process of human models, and to allow contributions (e.g., data sharing, accessing, etc.) from third parties.	agent-based model;algorithm;behavior model;computation;data mining;e-commerce;icl direct machine environment;internet;kid (templating language);open platform;personalization;realms	Runhe Huang;Atsushi Sato;Toshihiro Tamura;Jianhua Ma;Neil Y.

Although TUIs seem to intuitively offer potential to increase the learning experience, there have been questions about whether they actually impact learning positively. TUIs offer new ways of interactions and it is essential to understand how the design choices made for these new interactions affect learning. One element that is key in the learning process is how and when feedback is provided. In this article, we focus on the effect of co-located immediate process-level feedback on learning. We report the results of a study in which 56 participants used a TUI to complete tasks related to the training of spatial skills. Half of the students accomplished the tasks with immediate and co-located feedback from the system, while the other half of the students did not receive any feedback. Results show that participants who did not receive feedback manipulated less, reflected more, and in the end learned more than those who received feedback.	feedback;human–computer interaction;tangible user interface;text-based user interface	Sébastien Cuendet;Patrick Jermann;Pierre Dillenbourg	2012			error-driven learning;simulation;engineering;multimedia;communication	HCI	-67.60033336733987	-44.940264929819904	25418

Whilst the individual learning experience is paramount, the need to manage the numbers, resources and assessment provide an administrative overhead and headache to all teaching staff. With this predicament in mind a computer-supported learning system ( CECIL) was developed. It is a webbased teaching and learning resource and administration system. This paper describes the CECIL structure and discusses the potential benefits that a university-wide resource management system may have in terms of the educational flexibility and resource sharing.	blackwell (series);data mining;email;fault reporting;information system;negativity (quantum mechanics);overhead (computing);system administrator;web application;while	Lesley A.

e87db8c37c45e78b7997fc628b31d586dff82984	technology acceptance and actual use with mobile leraning: first stage for studying the influence of learning styles on the behavioral intention		Technology and mobile devices have been successfully integrated in peoples’ everyday activities. Educational institutions around the world are increasing their interest to create mobile learning (ML) environments considering the advantage of connectivity, situated learning, individualized learning, social interactivity, portability, affordability and more widely ubiquity. Even with the fast development of ML environments. There is however a lack of understanding about the factors that influence ML adoption. This paper proposes a framework for ML adoption integrating a modified Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) with constructs from the Expectation-Confirmation Theory (ECT). Since the goal for education is learning, this research will include individual attributes such as learning styles (LS) and experience to understand how they moderate ML adoption and actual use. For this reason, the framework brings together the adoption theory for initial use and the constructs of continuance intention for actual and habitual use as an outcome of learning. The framework is divided in two stages, acceptance and actual use. The purpose of this paper is to test the first stage: ML acceptance through the structural equation modeling statistical technique. The data was collected from students that already are experiencing ML. Findings demonstrate that performance and effort expectation constructs are significant predictors of ML and there is some influence of LS and experience as moderators for ML adoption.

The project is based on design work which was carried out over a longer period of time with a single rural pilot community in Namibia and its transferability of technology and concepts into other rural communities. In an attempt to overcome expensive technology adaptations we explore the possibility of having rural communities' crowdsource their defined and specified technology needs. We describe the concept and our current implementation with a first user evaluation in two rural communities. We also discuss the next phase of the project.	crowdsourcing	Colin Stanley;Heike Winschiers-Theophilus;Michel U.

These reasons include helping undergraduates to make informed choices about graduate school, and helping students to appreciate how research influences the practice of computer science.	computer science	Michael Hind;Phil Pfeiffer	1996	SIGPLAN Notices	10.1145/381841.381843	computer science	SE	-79.54238714228327	-34.51455234771273	25557

During the first half of the semester, the students received instruction in reading and writing technical documents, and had experience with professor-guided self-study. During the second half of the semester, the students presented an idea for a simulator, built it, and used it to conduct simple experiments. After completing the experiments, they were encouraged to brainstorm variations to the algorithms or architectures they simulated, which would improve performance. Student evaluations revealed that for 50% of the students, their interest in graduate school increased as a result of the class.	algorithm;brainstorm;bridging (networking);computer;experiment;simulation	Lori Carter;Scott Rae	2003		10.1145/1275521.1275530	computer science;multimedia	ML	-80.87993669305742	-35.321869200819386	25637

To be engaging and encourage learning, games must include a clear educational gain and must be scripted by the objectives of the course designer. Games’ evaluation is therefore essential. Finding the right game that best suits the needs of any Instructional Designer is often a laborious task. In this paper, we aim applying ontology matching algorithms to both games and IMS-LD compliant Learning processes to decide whether a game could be entirely integrated to the e-Learning process or should be adapted. For that aim, we have chosen ontologies as a relevant formalism for both IMS-LD and game theory.

3ef5062d9632c97872d0b475d1b61fe1c5066ebf	patterns for designing and implementing an environment for software start-up education		Today's students are prospective entrepreneurs and employees in modern, start-up like environments within established companies. In these settings, software development projects face extreme requirements in terms of innovation and attractiveness of the end-product. They also suffer severe consequences of failure such as termination of the development effort and bankruptcy. As the abilities needed in start-ups are not among those traditionally taught in universities, new knowledge and skills are required to prepare students for the volatile environment that new market entrants face. This paper reports experiences gained during seven years of teaching start-up knowledge and skills in a higher-education institution. We offer a collection of patterns that help educational institutions to design, implement and operate physical environments, curricula and teaching materials, and to plan interventions that may be required for project-based start-up education.	experience;prospective search;requirement;software development	Fabian Fagerholm;Arto Hellas;Matti Luukkainen;Kati Kyllonen;Sezin Gizem Yaman;Hanna Mäenpää	2017	2017 43rd Euromicro Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications (SEAA)	10.1109/SEAA.2017.67	curriculum;systems engineering;software development;entrepreneurship;software;bankruptcy;attractiveness;knowledge management;psychological intervention;engineering	SE	-82.35348700648255	-32.2448342464567	25854
8ef4c64cb734a68f4e3c7c2ffaf7d4d403a5aab3	quantity versus quality: a new approach to examine the relationship between technology use and student outcomes	outcomes of education;measurement techniques;academic achievement;evaluation methods;computer literacy;influence of technology;evaluation criteria;technology integration;computer mediated communication;technology uses in education;student development;instructional effectiveness;correlation;educational technology	The author argues that to examine the relationship between technology use and student outcomes, the quality of technology use—how, and what, technology is used—is a more significant factor than the quantity of technology use—how much technology is used. This argument was exemplified by an empirical study that used both angles to examine the association between technology use and student outcomes. When only the quantity of technology use was examined, no significant association was observed. However, when the quality of technology was examined by investigating the specific types of technology uses, a significant association was identified between technology use and all student outcomes. Furthermore, different types of technology use showed different influences on specific student outcomes. General technology uses were positively associated with student technology proficiency, while subject-specific technology uses were negatively associated with student technology proficiency. Social-communication technology uses were significantly positively associated with developmental outcomes such as self-esteem and positive attitude towards school. Entertainment/exploration technology use showed significant positive association with student learning habits. None of these technology uses had significant influence on student academic outcome. Specific suggestions for integrating technology into schools and future research were provided. Introduction In the last two decades, generous investments have been made in educational technology around the world. For example, the US had invested more than $66 billion in school technology in just 10 years (Quality Education Data, 2004). By 2004, China had spent 100 billion Yuan (about $13.2 billion) on educational technology (Zhao, 2005), and British Journal of Educational Technology Vol 41 No 3 2010 455–472 doi:10.1111/j.1467-8535.2009.00961.x © 2009 The Author. Journal compilation © 2009 Becta. Published by Blackwell Publishing, 9600 Garsington Road, Oxford OX4 2DQ, UK and 350 Main Street, Malden, MA 02148, USA. the annual expense on educational technology was projected to reach 35.5 billion Yuan in 2007 (Okokok Report, 2004). Ireland’s second national educational technology plan proposed to invest 107.92 million pounds in educational technology (Ireland Ministry of Education and Science, 2001). The generous investments were supported by the strongly held premise that technology can help students learn more efficiently and effectively, and as a result increase student academic achievement. This belief in the connection between technology and student achievement is a theme commonly emphasised in mission statements of educational technology projects and arguments to support educational technology investment (Zhao & Conway, 2001). For example, the first US national educational technology plan claims, ‘Properly used, technology increases students’ learning opportunities, motivation, and achievement’ (U.S. Department of Education, 1996, p. 10). The second plan assures that technology would ‘enhance learning and improve student achievement for all students’ (U.S. Department of Education, 2000, p. 4). The third plan further states that with new technologies, ‘10 years from now we could be looking at the greatest leap forward in achievement in the history of education. By any measure, the improvements will be dramatic’ (U.S. Department of Education, p. 11). However, this premise on the crucial role of technology in student achievement has not been substantially supported by empirical evidence. In fact, findings from different empirical studies focusing on the effect of technology on learning have been inconsistent and contradictory. On the one hand, some studies have identified significant positive impact of technology use on student outcomes in academic areas such as literacy development (Blasewitz & Taylor, 1999; Tracey & Young, 2006), reading comprehension and vocabulary (Scrase, 1998; Stone, 1996; Woehler, 1994), writing (Nix, 1998), mathematics (Elliott & Hall, 1997; Mac Iver, Balfanz & Plank, 1999) and science (Harmer & Cates, 2007; Lazarowitz & Huppert, 1993; Liu, Hsieh, Cho & Schallert, 2006; Reid-Griffin, 2003). For example, Tienken and Wilson (2007) compared seventhgrade students whose teachers used mathematics websites and presentation software in their classrooms with students whose teachers did not teach with these technology tools. They found that the use of these technology tools had a positive effect on students’ learning of basic mathematic skills. In addition, positive impacts have been identified in student developmental areas, including attitude towards learning and self-esteem (Nguyen, Hsieh & Allen, 2006; Sivin-Kachala & Bialo, 2000), motivation, attendance and discipline (eg, Matthew, 1997). For example, using a mixed-method design, Wighting (2006) reported that using computers in the classroom positively affected students’ sense of learning in a community. Similarly, in the UK, a series of research studies have been conducted to examine the effect of the large-scale Tablet PC programmes, and findings reveal that the use of technology has improved student access to curriculum, communication and motivation (eg, Sheehy et al, 2005; Twining et al, 2006). On the other hand, several other researchers have come to very different conclusions. Some argue that technology use may not have any positive impact on student outcomes. For example, The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) Programme for International Student Assessment 2003 study found that stu456 British Journal of Educational Technology Vol 41 No 3 2010 © 2009 The Author. Journal compilation © 2009 Becta. dents using computers most frequently at school did not necessarily perform better than students using technology less frequently, and the impact of technology use on student math achievement varied by countries (OECD, 2005). In March 2007, the Institute of Education Sciences released an influential report titled Effectiveness of Reading and Mathematics Software Products: Findings from the First Student Cohort. This study, intended to assess the effects of 16 computer software products designed to teach firstand fourthgrade reading and sixth-grade math, using a rigorous random assignment design, found that ‘test scores in treatment classrooms that were randomly assigned to use products did not differ from test scores in control classrooms by statistically significant margins’ (Dynarski et al, 2007, p. xiii). Furthermore, some studies suggest that technology use might even harm children and their learning (eg, Healy, 1998; Stoll, 1999). For example, Waight and Abd-El-Khalick (2007) found that the use of computer technology restricted rather than promoted ‘inquiry’ in a sixth-grade science classroom. Mixed findings have also emerged from large-scale international studies. A study of the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) reported that technology use was negatively related to science achievement among eighth graders in Turkey (Aypay, Erdogan & Sozer, 2007). Another TIMSS study found that while medium use of computer technology was related to higher science scores, extensive use was related to lower science scores (Antonijevic, 2007). Similarly, based on data collected from 175 000 15-year-old students in 31 countries, researchers at the University of Munich announced that performance in math and reading had suffered significantly among students who had more than one computer at home (MacDonald, 2004). Schacter (1999) also identified some negative impacts on student achievement through the review of five large-scale studies that employed diverse research methods to examine the impact of educational technology. Discouraged by these findings, some people have come to the conclusion that putting computers in classrooms has been wasteful and pointless (Oppenheimer, 2003). Existing research on the relationship technology on student learning presents a mixed message (Andrews et al, 2007; O’Dwyer, Russell, Bebell & Tucker-Seeley, 2005; Torgerson & Zhu, 2003). Such mixed and often conflicting findings make it difficult to draw conclusions about the effects of technology, to provide meaningful advice to those who make decisions about technology investment in education and to make practical suggestions for integrating technology into schools. There are at least two problems contributing to the controversy over the relationship between technology use and student outcomes. The first is that technology is often examined at a very general level (Zhao, 2003). Many studies ‘treat technology as an undifferentiated characteristic of schools and classrooms. No distinction is made between different types of technology programs’ (Wenglinsky, 1998, p. 3). We know that technology is a very broad term that includes many kinds of hardware and software. These technologies may have different impacts on student outcomes. Even the same technology can be used differently in various contexts to solve all kinds of problems (Zhao) and thus have ‘different meanings in different settings’ (Peyton & Bruce, Quantity versus quality on technology use 457 © 2009 The Author. Journal compilation © 2009 Becta. 1993, p. 10). Treating technology as if it is a single thing obscures the unique characteristics of different technologies and their uses. The second problem is the focus of the studies. Most studies focus on the impact of the quantity of technology use, in other words, how much or how frequently technology is used, but ignore the quality of technology use, that is, how technology is used. For example, many studies examine the relationship between how much time students spend on using computers or how often they use computers and their achievement (eg, Du, Havard, Yu & Adams, 2004; Mann, Shakeshaft, Becker & Kottkamp, 1999). However, research suggests that the quality of technology use is more critical 	2-satisfiability;blackwell (series);compiler;computer hardware;conway's game of life;donald becker;el torito (cd-rom standard);geforce 9 series;jim hall (programmer);nix package manager;randomness;regular expression;tablet computer;tucker decomposition;vocabulary	Jing Lei	2010	BJET	10.1111/j.1467-8535.2009.00961.x	psychology;computer literacy;educational technology;knowledge management;evaluation;correlation;pedagogy	HCI	-77.27482116495389	-32.25118799310175	25915

Attempts have been made to objectively define what comprises a successful collaboration. Questions like """"When can we say that a collaboration is successful?"""" or """"Is there a way to predict that a collaboration would be successful?"""" have been asked. In this paper, we look at the output of the collaboration, which are the debugging scores of the pairs, and we consider a collaboration to be successful if it leads to good debugging scores. We choose pair programming because it is an example of a collaboration paradigm. In order to find out what are the potential factors that could possibly predict success in the context of a pair program tracing and debugging task, we performed a dual eye tracking experiment on pairs of novice programmers. We tracked and recorded their fixation sequences and analyzed them using Cross-Recurrence Quantification Analysis (CRQA). Two machine learning algorithms were used, such as Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. Our findings reveal that CRQA results alone are inadequate to come up with a model with an acceptable performance. Hence, we added the pairs' proficiency level to the model. Between the two models, the Logistic Regression model turned out to be the better model. However, the performance is still not quite unacceptable to predict success so other features are needed to enhance the model."""	algorithm;cross-recurrence quantification;debugging;eye tracking;logistic regression;machine learning;naive bayes classifier;pair programming;programmer;programming paradigm;recurrence quantification analysis	Maureen Villamor;Ma.

Most workplace e-learning applications fail to meet the needs of learners and ultimately fail to serve the organization’s quest for success. To solve this problem, we need to examine what workplace e-learning requires and how workplace e-learning systems should be developed in line with those requirements. We investigated the problem by identifying the fundamental elements of the workplace learning environment including the learner, organization, learning content and social context, and their relationships. We found that workplace e-learning should align individual and organizational learning needs, connect learning and work performance, and support social interaction among individuals. To achieve this, a performance-oriented approach is proposed in this study. Key performance indicators are utilized to clarify organizational goals, make sense of work context and requests on work performance, and accordingly help employees set up rational learning objectives and enhance their learning process. Using this approach, a prototype system has been developed and a set of experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.	align (company);experiment;prototype;requirement	Minhong Wang;Weijia Ran;Jian Liao;Stephen J.

Computer Science students are usually taught theoretical disciplines with very few laboratory experiences, especially including real systems. In this paper we want to present a course for Bachelor students in Computer Science which is based on laboratory experiences and aims at making the students familiar with physical systems modeling and control, haptics and human-robot interaction. The course has been recently introduced at the University of Verona as a pilot experiment, with positive reactions from the students. We will describe the proposed method and its integration with the current curriculum in our University. The goals of the course are: the application of theoretical concepts from different disciplines to a real system (haptic paddle); the introduction of the human factor in such real system and its analysis; the improvement of the students ability to solve problems when facing real systems; the improvement of transversal knowledge, such as autonomously finding a solution using previous knowledge, performing scientific experiments, team work, collecting and reporting scientific results.	computer science;experience;experiment;haptic technology;human factors and ergonomics;human–robot interaction;medical robot;systems modeling	Carlo Tadiello;Giacomo De Rossi;Marta Capiluppi;Riccardo Muradore;Paolo Fiorini	2016	2016 European Control Conference (ECC)	10.1109/ECC.2016.7810314	simulation;engineering;multimedia;mechanical engineering	AI	-67.12100856584824	-51.28190941318374	26006

The CASS-methods and tools provide contextualized data that allow the analyzing and modeling of within-person changes across time. This paper describes a pilot study with 3G mobiles used by eight engineering students. Students answered questionnaires concerning their ongoing study projects, academic emotions, and collaboration, with a mobile phone five times a day for a period of two weeks (70 queries per person). Variation in their emotions were examined by time-series analysis. Students were also interviewed before and after the CASS-query period. Interview and query data were used to form a picture of the variation of daily routines, challenges, and reflections of one’s own activities related to engagement in academic tasks or leisure. The study reports results regarding students’ experiences of the CASS-methodology, emotional experiences during the two-week follow-up, their objects and activities related to personal study projects they undertook during this period.	amiga reflections;context-sensitive grammar;experience;mobile phone;time series	Hanni Muukkonen;Kai Hakkarainen;Kari Kosonen;Satu Jalonen;Annamari Heikkilä;Kirsti Lonka;Katariina Salmela-Aro;Juha Linnanen;Kari Salo	2007			psychology;simulation;human–computer interaction;time series;multimedia;communication;pedagogy	HCI	-75.56249407811453	-44.48816295261817	26055

These concepts are central to component-based software engineering (CBSE), a challenging subject to address in a university course, given that some degree of software development complexity is necessary for effectively practicing it. This paper describes an experiment carried in an advanced programming course offered at our institution, consisting of having a collaborative course project targeting the practice of CBSE. In this collaborative project, different student teams developed parts of an IDE whose designs were tested by other teams in terms of component interoperability and extensibility. Although students were able to practice the CBSE-related concepts in approximate real settings, the necessary technical supervision from instructors might consist of a pitfall.	approximation algorithm;bus mastering;component-based software engineering;computer science;extensibility;interoperability;software development	André L.

This increases costs incurred by coordination and communication overhead. Simultaneously, typical educational games have smaller budgets than normal entertainment games. In order to address this challenge, we present an overview of game development processes and map these processes into a concept for an authoring tool that unifies the different workflows and facilitates close collaboration in development teams. Using the tool, authors can create the structure of a game and fill it with content without relying on game programmers. For adding adaptivity to the game, the authoring tool features specific user support measures that assist the authors in the relatively novel field of creating non-linear, adaptive educational experiences. Evaluations with users recruited from actual user groups involved in game development shows the applicability of this process.

Therefore a lot of potential is seen in distance learning development. Virtual environment interface to E-learning systems have recently appeared on the Internet. Using virtual reality environment, the applications appear to be promising to E-learning tasks more nature and interactive. Also using this technology, it is possible to get a sense of three dimensional environments and level of user immersion. Extensible 3D (X3D) is the most common tool for building 3D viewing and browsing of E-learning systems. In this paper the benefits of virtual reality environment using X3D in E-learning applications are demonstrated. Those will be shown via implementing two Web enabled virtual environment E-learning systems. The first one is an on-line virtual chemistry lab system. This application gives the student the ability to perform all experiments in a certain crucial. The second application is an on-line English language education system. This application gives the students the ability to learn the language audile and visual via on line interactive system. X3D is used as the main implementation tool which give the systems users the full visualization and interactivity of all learning steps.	3d modeling;another world;desktop computer;environment (systems);experiment;immersion (virtual reality);interactivity;internet;online and offline;reduced cost;replication (computing);virtual reality;x3d	Hatem Abdul-Kader	2008	2008 ITI 6th International Conference on Information & Communications Technology		simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;instructional simulation;multimedia	Visualization	-66.47560532171975	-42.38730140932477	26321

052348e7a301fb381dcb544fae5d7dd3e91725e9	can natural language processing become natural language coaching?		How we teach and learn is undergoing a revolution, due to changes in technology and connectivity. Education may be one of the best application areas for advanced NLP techniques, and NLP researchers have much to contribute to this problem, especially in the areas of learning to write, mastery learning, and peer learning. In this paper I consider what happens when we convert natural language processors into natural language coaches. 1 Why Should You Care, NLP Researcher? There is a revolution in learning underway. Students are taking Massive Open Online Courses as well as online tutorials and paid online courses. Technology and connectivity makes it possible for students to learn from anywhere in the world, at any time, to fit their schedules. And in today’s knowledge-based economy, going to school only in one’s early years is no longer enough; in future most people are going to need continuous, lifelong education. Students are changing too — they expect to interact with information and technology. Fortunately, pedagogical research shows significant benefits of active learning over passive methods. The modern view of teaching means students work actively in class, talk with peers, and are coached more than graded by their instructors. In this new world of education, there is a great need for NLP research to step in and help. I hope in this paper to excite colleagues about the possibilities and suggest a few new ways of looking at them. I do not attempt to cover the field of language and learning comprehensively, nor do I claim there is no work in the field. In fact there is quite a bit, such as a recent special issue on language learning resources (Sharoff et al., 2014), the long running ACL workshops on Building Educational Applications using NLP (Tetreault et al., 2015), and a recent shared task competition on grammatical error detection for second language learners (Ng et al., 2014). But I hope I am casting a few interesting thoughts in this direction for those colleagues who are not focused on this particular topic.	algorithm;central processing unit;error detection and correction;excite;knowledge-based systems;massive open online course;natural language processing;schedule (computer science)	Marti A.

Intergenerational learning (IGL) involves knowledge building, innovation and knowledge transfer between generations within an organization (Ropes 2011). Serious games refer to the use of computer games in raising awareness about educational topics, acquiring new knowledge and skills by enabling learners to engage and participate in situations that would otherwise be impossible to experience (Corti 2006). Although learning with the use of serious games is similar to traditional learning in several cognitive respects, there are noted differences in the learning style and structure of learning using serious games. The success of learning using serious games lies in the actual involvement of a participant playing the game, which in turn, creates increased cognitive links with real-life situations allowing the individual to make relevant associations, to use mnemonic strategies with the facilitation of multi-dimensional educational aids (e.g., visual, auditory). Some of the beneficial aspects of learning with the use of serious games include the elevation of several cognitive skills, which are directly or indirectly implicated in the learning process. Among them are attention and visuo-spatial abilities, memory and motor skills. However, several barriers have been noted that fall into two general categories: a) health issues (e.g., cognitive strain, headaches) and b) psychological issues (e.g., social isolation, emotional disturbances). Since the training conditions are learner-centered and highly determined by the individual, there is increased need for evaluating the learning outcomes using specific success indicators. Examples of games that are designed to facilitate IGL are scarce, while there are no examples of IGL games in most EU countries. The purpose of this paper is to critically evaluate the current literature of theories on learning through serious games in adults and the elderly with reference to the cognitive mechanisms implicated, benefits and barriers in learning using new technologies in different generations. Secondly, this paper reviews the existence of serious games designed to facilitate IGL in Europe, as well as the characteristics of serious games in raising awareness that could be used to facilitate IGL. In doing so, specific focus is placed on the development of success indicators that determine the effectiveness of serious games on raising awareness on IGL.	emoticon;knowledge management;one-to-one (data model);pc game;real life;theory	Antonia Ypsilanti;Ana B.

But, the course can be customized by the introduction of adaptability in these systems. In order to develop adaptative systems of distance learning, it is necessary to consider the problems: instructional planning and the student model. The first problem allows to generate a specific sequence of content for each student and the second one provides the necessary information to cope with adaptativity.Planning techniques in Artificial Intelligence have been successfully used for determining the sequence of instructional actions. The Workflow technology has been used for the management of these systems. Then, this paper presents an adaptative instructional planning and a student model based on theories of cognitive levels and learning styles.	artificial intelligence;genetic algorithm;relevance;theory;workflow engine	Robson da Silva Lopes;Márcia Aparecida Fernandes	2009	2009 Eighth IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Computer and Information Science	10.1109/ICIS.2009.197	simulation;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence	AI	-81.31381160669842	-44.32418357603696	26840

It reports on two surveys conducted in March 2002 and October 2002-February 2003 respectively and thus offers a longitudinal perspective. The questionnaires were administered both on paper and electronically and the results compared but no differences in data collected could be detected. The results showed a growth in usage in the relatively short period between the two surveys and subject area studied proved to be the main determinant of EIS usage, followed by integration into the programme. Mode of attendance is an issue and off-Campus usage is growing, with an increasing emphasis on workplace access. The catalogue was found to be no longer ‘the key to the library’ and gateways and links were little used. A relationship between student progression and retention and EIS usage was identified.

Mostly, the intelligent systems that AIED has delivered so far have used computers and other devices that were essentially designed for businesses or personal use, and not specifically for education. The future holds the promise of creating technologies designed specifically for learning and teaching by combining the power of AIED with advances in the field of robotics and in the increasing use of sensor devices to monitor our surroundings and actions. The paper assumes that “schools” (i.e., a place where children will gather to learn) will still exist in some shape or form in 25 years and that teachers will continue to oversee and promote learning among the students. It proposes that there will be educational cobots assisting teachers in the classrooms of tomorrow and provides examples from current work in robotics. It also envisions smart classrooms that make use of sensors to support learning and illustrates how they might be used in new ways if AIED applications are embedded into them.	artificial intelligence;cobot;computer;educational data mining;electrical engineering;embedded system;feedback;human–robot interaction;internet of things;out of the box (feature);robot;robotics;sensor;smart tv;thinking outside the box	Michael J.

The proje ct started in December 2007 and runs till December 2010. Main purpose is to mot ivate children for studying sciences and technology. In Belgium there is a lack of students studying engineering, physics, chemistry, biology, technology and inform atics. The project aims to enlarge the knowledge of children in primary and secondary education in the field of ICT in general, and new technologies as mobile devices for learning in particular. In the project students will learn and study with WEB 2.0 applications, using mobile devices. After the project children will have a clear inside how mobile devices can contribute to learning and working. The project is supported b y companies and research units of the University of Hasselt. 1 Background of the project Due to the fact that not enough students choose for studying exact sciences and engineering, companies face a shortage of labour forces. The Fle mish government wants to solve the problem by financing special projects from universi tie and their research units to work out special programs or projects that encourage student s to choose for exact sciences and engineering. The project wants to popularize scienc es. Nowadays exact sciences and technology have no special motivation anymore for y unger people. Professions as information scientist are seen as boring, working l one y behind a desktop. In reality these professions have made a real change last years. Inf ormation scientists have also to have organizational and communicational skills. Through visiting companies, universities and research units and having contacts with workers and researchers the project hopes children get motivated for these professions. The project hopes for a positive influence in the study-choice of children and pupils in secondary, higher educati on and university studies.	desktop computer;information scientist;mobile device;web 2.0	Ruben Jans;Valère Awouters	2009	iJIM	10.3991/ijim.v3i2.749	educational technology;simulation;computer science;multimedia	Web+IR	-74.6903041439162	-30.518895059502675	26931

Our purpose here is to generalize from that experience to identify the chief elements needed to get an ethics program started in a new profession. We are focusing on new professions for two reasons. First, all the older professions, both in the US and in most other countries, now have ethics programs of some sort. They do not need our advice to get started. Second, new professions face special problems just because they are new-everything from deciding who belongs to the profession to formalizing ethical standards so that they can be taught. Our purpose in this paper is to generalize from our experience and to identify some of the fundamentals for getting an ethics program started in a new profession. We present our recommendations in the form of response to 6 questions anyone designing an ethics program for a new profession should ask.

This paper introduced three levels of Computational Thinking: Computational Thinking in computer science, Computational Thinking in computing science and Computational Thinking in all subjects and analyzed the thinking characteristic of calculation and the calculation attribute of thinking. Through Computational Thinking, human can solve problems by using computer more efficiently. Therefore, the cultivation of Computational Thinking's ability was particularly important in teaching. But Computational Thinking cannot be taught without carrier and the programing course was the best way for they were closely related with each other. The paper took the Maze Problem as an example to express the differences between human and computer in the aspects of storage structure, thinking mode, solving procedure, etc. and it compared the human brain's multi-dimension and multi-forms characteristics with the computer's ne-dimension and one-form characteristics. The paper thought the goal of teaching was not to learn knowledge itself, but to form problem solving thinking.	bus mastering;computation;computational thinking;computer memory;computer science;consciousness;problem solving;requirement	Ying Li	2016	2016 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)	10.1109/FIE.2016.7757408	cognitively guided instruction;vertical thinking;applied mathematics;computer science;artificial intelligence;critical systems thinking	Theory	-84.33566382020304	-37.15004384603046	26955

In this paper we present a new approach to predict sequential/global dimension of Felder-Silverman's learning style model that only makes use of mouse movement patterns. The results obtained in a case study with 18 students are very promising. We found a strong correlation between maximum vertical speed and sequential/global dimension score. Moreover, it was possible to predict whether students' learning styles are global or sequential with high accuracy (94.4%). This suggests that mouse movement patterns can be a powerful source of information about certain user features.		Danilo Spada;Manuel A. Sánchez-Montañés;Pedro Paredes;Rosa M.

The purpose of this research is to investigate the information needs and searching behaviors of researchers, and their implications for electronic literature search tools. We conducted mixed-method case studies involving interviews, diary logs, and observations of computer scientists followed by a web-based survey to validate our findings. The results show that computer science researchers have the following main purposes for seeking information: keeping up to date, exploring new topics, reviewing literature, collaborating, preparing lectures, and recommending material for students. We found that keeping up to date with research is the most frequent purpose and exploring unfamiliar research areas is the most difficult. Furthermore, we found that literature searching is a collaborative process and, depending on the search purpose, different information sources and navigation strategies are used. On the basis of these findings we discuss six design challenges for literature search tools, which are: providing support for keeping up to date with research, exploring unfamiliar topics, browsing user history, collaborating and sharing, performing a federated search that goes beyond scholarly research, and sorting and navigating the results.	computer scientist;emergence;federated search;information needs;sorting;web application	Kumaripaba Athukorala;Eve E.

Using TRAKLA2 they got acquainted with a completely new system for solving exercises that provided them with automatic feedback and the possibility to resubmit their solutions. Besides comparing the students’ learning results, a survey was made with 100 students on the changes in their attitudes towards web-based learning environments. In addition, a usability evaluation was conducted in a human-computer interaction laboratory. Our results show that TRAKLA2 considerably increased the positive attitudes towards webbased learning. According to students’ self-evaluations, the best learning results are achieved by combining traditional exercises with web-based ones. In addition, the numerical course statistics were clearly better than in 2003 when only pen-and-paper exercises in class were used. The results from the usability test were also very positive: no severe usability problems were revealed; in fact, the results indicate that the system is very easy to learn and user-friendly as a whole.	algorithm;data structure;human–computer interaction;numerical analysis;simulation;usability testing;web application	Mikko-Jussi Laakso;Tapio Salakoski;Linda Grandell;Xuemei Qiu;Ari Korhonen;Lauri Malmi	2005	Informatics in Education		usability goals;pluralistic walkthrough;web usability;component-based usability testing;cognitive walkthrough;simulation;usability;human–computer interaction;computer science;usability engineering;multimedia;heuristic evaluation;usability lab;usability inspection	HCI	-68.10661610302617	-43.22722652808934	26993

The proposed method is composed of three parts: discovering contentrelated item sets by Collaborative Filtering (CF), applying the item sets to Sequential Pattern Mining (SPM) and generating sequential pattern recommendations to learners. Different from other recommendation strategies which use CF or SPM separately, this paper combines the two algorithms together and makes some optimizations to adapt them for E-learning environments. Experiments are conducted for the evaluation of the proposed approach and the results show good performance of it.	algorithm;collaborative filtering;data mining;personalization;sequential pattern mining;super paper mario	Yi Li;Zhendong Niu;Wei Chen;Wenshi Zhang	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-25813-8_33	computer science;data science;collaborative filtering;machine learning;data mining;database;world wide web	ML	-81.36906800294841	-47.32742032180002	27035

These students attended a programming session designed to applied computational principles in different fields. We have analyzed how this acceptance varies with age, and also if their opinion changes if they were exposed to a real robot teacher or not. To this end, participants (N=210) were divided in two groups, one was lectured by a teacher and the other one by a Baxter robot. We used the Negative Attitudes towards Robots Scale and the Robot Anxiety Scale questionnaires to evaluate students' perception. Statistical analysis of the answers to these questionnaires is discussed in the paper, both taking into account the whole groups and another considering three subgroups based on age. Main conclusion of the study is that the use of the robot is relevant in the perception of the students about robots, but also that age is significant in the perception of robots as potential teachers.	baxter (robot);robot	Miguel Ángel Conde González;Camino Fernández;Francisco J.

The introduction of usability evaluation methods (UEMs) to assess and improve usability in such systems has led to a variety of alternative approaches and a general lack of understanding of the capabilities and limitations of each. This confusion has intensified the need for practitioners and others to determine which methods are more effective, and in what ways and for what purposes. However, UEMs cannot be evaluated and compared reliably because of the lack of standard criteria for comparison. This paper presents a practical discussion of factors, comparison criteria, and UEM performance measures that are interesting and useful in studies comparing UEMs. We have attempted to highlight major considerations and concepts, offering some operational definitions and exposing the hazards of some approaches proposed or reported in the literature. In demonstrating the importance of developing appropriate UEM evaluation criteria, we present some different possible measures of effectiveness, select and review studies that use two of the more popular measures, and consider the trade-offs among different criterion definitions. In sum, this work highlights some of the specific challenges that researchers and practitioners face when comparing UEMs and provides a point of departure for further discussion and refinement of the principles and techniques used to approach UEM evaluation and comparison.	interactivity;refinement (computing);software system;usability	H.

It is often considered a subset of Virtual Volunteering where one can volunteer one's time and energy via the Internet. There are many successful examples of Virtual Volunteering such as the Gutenberg project and the Librivox project. However, in both these cases, a volunteer must donate a substantial amount of his or her time in activities such as reading books or proofreading books. This paper examines the concept of synchronous micro-volunteering where potential volunteers can effectively donate as little as 10 minutes of their time and immediately assist other people. The paper then describes the architecture which supports synchronous micro-volunteering.	book;internet;social media	Laurie L. Butgereit;Reinhardt A.

8b6a64ce4a3b8dc1ff658a985f85edd33f0011c7	methods and recommendations for archival records of game development: the case of academic games		The future of computer game history lies in preservation. Most work has focused on the collection and maintenance of completed games, both digital and physical, but for game history to mature we need to look beyond singular objects and venture deeper into games’ development history. There is a problem, however, in that most development practice and technique is hidden, either by corporate opacity or a lack of basic techniques for preserving game development documentation. Three issues stand in the way: first, while game studies needs access to documentation, and game developers want to see their work remembered (and perhaps later “remastered”), little work has been done to promote this common cause; second, archives and cultural repositories need guidance from game studies practitioners and game designers in strategies for interpreting development documentation; and third, game developers need to organize their process and documentation outputs with an understanding of future preservation (both for their own internal use and for external study). In this paper, we draw on previous archival movements in the history of science and technology to argue for a unified approach to the preservation of computer game documentation. Our work, derived from a case study of UCSC’s game Prom Week, presents a first attempt at a communication strategy between game studies researchers, archivists, and developers in dealing with the organization, categorization, and storage of development records. We outline the development process, discuss numerous issues that surprised us in dealing with its documentation, and present recommendations and guidance for similar treatments of other game development work. This is an initial step towards a more structured interaction between academia, developers and archives in the informed retention of game documentation. Further efforts for other classes of games, like those developed outside academia, is necessary to create a holistic, discipline-wide understanding of the benefits of document preservation and use. By engaging in greater collaboration, game studies researchers, developers, and archivists, can begin to solve the problems facing the preservation of games’ creative history.	archive;case preservation;categorization;documentation;holism;pc game;recommender system;subject reduction;video game development	Eric Kaltman;Noah Wardrip-Fruin;Henry Lowood;Christy Caldwell	2015			simulation;multimedia;computer science;video game development	HCI	-63.09588372224943	-33.21936226822028	27280

Previous attempts to use electronic means to transmit and store information in the health care delivery environment, which have largely been focused on single specialities, are discussed. It is argued that none of these systems has been comprehensive enough to have a major impact on primary care and that the geographic dispersion of health care will require new communication systems and new information storage systems. Development of integrated computer and communication systems based on high-speed digital and broadband fiber optics technology should improve the quality of medical care and should enhance the efficiency of the health care delivery process.

In this way, the context surveys emerge as measures associated with the achievement tests to control the contextual factors with influence over the students. Although in the literature the socioeconomic level is imposed as a key contextual variable, there is not a particular standard to construct scales of this type at the international level. This study, from an initial sample of 6765 students and 78 educative centers located in Baja California (México), describes the process carried out for the construction of a scale for the socioeconomic level measurement and it validates the results obtained in relation with the """"Tests ENLACE"""", applied to Elementary Education students at the national level.  Therefore, this proposal pretends to create a specific model for the construction of these contextual scales of socioeconomic level, taking into account its relation with the own Tests ENLACE.

Because of the frustrating results obtained by students of the “Physical Fundamentals of Computer Engineering” course during the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 academic years, it was decided to examine strategies to overcome the low academic performance, but maintaining the common assessment policy. The general idea of our proposal is provide students with freedom to prepare their own strategies. To accomplish that, new assessment events were introduced along the term. Thus, students can take a test at the end of each unit, they can also take a midterm exam, combine freely both strategies, or even take a final exam. After applying the proposed strategies, on the one hand the final grades obtained by the students were better than in previous years, and on the other hand, the teacher observed a greater interest in the subject that leads to improve student engagement.	computer engineering;continuous integration;final exam;unit testing	Lenin-G.

74ee406708b8648e23e60db9a46f150a7edd57ce	identifying cultural design requirements for an australian indigenous website	indigenous website;focus group;culture specific;web design	This paper examines literature concerning the design of culture into websites and in particular indigenous websites. The intention is to identify design requirements as the first phase of building an indigenous website for the Wollotuka Institute located in the Awabakal nation and situated at the University of Newcastle, NSW, Australia. The aim of the project is to produce a website that best reflects the identity, needs and culture of the local Wollotuka community. Wollotuka supports a broad range of indigenous programs incorporating administrative, academic and research activities and provides support and development services for indigenous staff and students. Unfortunately many existing frameworks and indeed Western conceptions about what knowledge is and how it should be captured, organised and presented do not necessarily meet the culture of the intended indigenous users. The work described in this paper focuses on the many issues of concern when attempting to design a website that is specific for a local cultural community such as Wollotuka. We review previous work in cultural design and discuss some generic issues related to the representation and capture of indigenous knowledge. This review provides us with some general considerations and more specific guidelines for culture-specific design. Of particular interest is that narrative and object are conceptualised as a duality in knowledge representations found in Australian Indigenous culture. We also examine issues of design process and use our findings to support the choice of a user-centric design method, where we localise the design, through an iterative, prototyping process . .	domain-specific language;duality (optimization);iterative design;iterative method;requirement;situated;software prototyping	Reece George;Keith Nesbitt;Patricia Gillard;Michael Donovan	2010			web design;computer science;knowledge management;focus group;management science	HCI	-66.23394346868122	-33.26064065340723	27633

The choice of alerting mechanism can be important, because as previous research has shown, different interruption styles have different potential advantages and disadvantages. To explore impacts of interruptions in the end-user debugging domain, this paper describes an empirical comparison of two interruption styles that have been used to alert end-user programmers to debugging information. Our results show that negotiated-style interruptions were superior to immediate-style interruptions in several issues of importance to end-user debugging, and further suggest that a reason for this superiority may be that immediate-style interruptions encourage different debugging strategies.	debugging;end-user development;interrupt;online and offline;plaintext;programmer;relevance;software bug	T.

Because of the large class size and resource implications, we opted for a simple approach: the modified lecture format. We devised active learning sheets for use during lectures. Each sheet consisted of short questions which covered the main points of the lecture. Students had to answer the questions during the lectures as they listened. In this paper we describe how we designed the active learning sheets for this particular course, and the students' (positive) response to them.	active learning (machine learning);imperative programming	Kung-Kiu Lau	2007		10.1145/1227310.1227382	imperative programming;formal methods;computer science;artificial intelligence;active learning;programming language;algorithm	AI	-81.81061294812653	-36.59679730821031	27699

Students need to achieve a certain level of 3D fluency in modeling, animation, and programming to be able to create compelling 3D content. The combination of innovative end-user development tools and standards-based curriculum that promotes IT fluency by shifting the pedagogical focus from programming to design, can address motivational aspects without sacrificing principled educational goals. The AgentCubes 3D game-authoring environment raises the ceiling of end-user development without raising the threshold. Our formal user study shows that with Incremental 3D, the gradual approach to transition from 2D to 3D authoring, middle school students can build sophisticated 3D games including 3D models, animations, and programming. & 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Scientific advancement and technological means would give a better living condition in the changing world. For this, an organised institutional setup is needed. The universities in the new millennium must take the task of channelising the institutions appropriately, to make the people realise the qualitative fruit of new inventions and ideologies. An attempt is made in this paper to highlight the present way of functioning of universities in India and to highlight the task of universities in the new millennium in other dimensions also, in a wider manner so as to serve as a bridge between the technology and society. This would be able to drain all the possible benefits of new inventions to the society through appropriate technological means.		K.

b089fca33e62fff491d446dd7d480f2bc1309a6f	using mobile technologies with young language learners to support and promote oral language production		The paper examines how the use of mobile technologies such as tablets and handheld MP3 players can support and promote oral language production among young language learners. It explores how the use of these mobile technologies in the language classroom supports pedagogical practices anchored in socioconstructivist theories of SLA that emphasize the role of dialogue and social interaction among young language learners. The paper is based on a collaborative action research project involving French Immersion teachers and their students in primary schools in a western province of Canada. Findings show that the affordances of mobile technologies contribute to the creation of innovative learning environments and authentic language learning experiences that support and promote the production of oral language among young language learners. The inquiry demonstrates the adoption of second language pedagogical approaches anchored in socioconstructivist theories of SLA that promote autonomy and a sense of agency among language learners.

The task of designing interactive interfaces for cooperative work and group decision making is even more difficult. Not only is it necessary to deal with the individualu0027s cognitive processes and their model of the computer aided task, but also to build software to support human - human communication with all the underlying socialization and group dynamics that this communication implies. In the development of the Capture Lab, a computer supported meeting environment, guesswork was coupled with a study of human behavior in meetings both electronic and conventional. Added to these approaches was an extrapolation of existing research studies on non-computerized meetings and a series of mini-experiments to test out various ideas about the design. The body of the paper describes the application of this mixture along with the design considerations at issue and the meeting behaviors we have since observed as a result of our design choices.

4d89757cc4be7eb19e0dc410bc3383c90178f45f	doing things with factors		We conducted an experiment to investigate whether a human tutor could employ the CATO model and instructional program to teach legal research and argumentation skills to beginning law stu&nts. The CATO model covem arguments comparing and contrasting casesin terms of factors, abstractionsof facts that tend to strengthen or weaken a party’s position on a legal claim. At the time of the experimen~ the CATO program comprised tools and resources that help apply the CATO model to specific problems, most importantly, a case database and tools for retrieving, displaying, and comparing casesin terms of factors. We compmed human-led itulruction with CATO against more traditional classroom instruction designed to teach the same skills, without the use of the CATO model or tools. The subjects were 17 fmtsemester students from the University of Pittsburgh Law School. We found that human-guided instruction with CATO was as good as classroom instruction, We also found that answers generated by the CATO program were scored higher than the students’ answers, suggestingthat the model can potentially be employed even more effectively to teach students. Examples drawn from protocols of CATO sessionsih.trate that students can use the CATO model to guide and facilitate the construction of arguments and often go beyond the model’s limitations, at least under the guidance of a human tutor.	mathematical model	Vincent Aleven;Kevin D.

a4290bc51531c0c6eb6069209c8c34b2d17a54f1	the use of gamification for teaching algorithms		This paper presents our experience using gamification principles into the free and open-source learning management system Moodle for aiding and abetting our Computer Science students in learning algorithms. In this work, we used the LMS Moodle and we developed a module with gamification features focused on promoting engagement of students in the learning process of basic concepts of algorithms, data structures and pointers. We conducted a deep study about Moodle and how to implement gamification plugins into the environment. We used and configured HotPotatoes, Games, LevelUp and Badges plugins. We defined the lessons about the specific concepts of algorithms and we created them into Moodle environment. Then we implemented several games, like hangman, crosswords, cryptex, snakes and ladders. We used LevelUp with the objective to gamify the students' learning experience by allowing them to earn experience points to level up in their courses. Badges were used in order to motivate students in their achievements and to show their progress in the courses. In our learning environment, it is possible to have different levels of proficiency in the class and rewards are based on different rules the professor can define; the student can earn more points for some activities or fewer points for other activities. A comparative ranking can be displayed so that students can see their progress, and the professor can look at the log to verify the activities students did and the points they have earned. The results showed us that the use of gamification concepts can contribute significantly to the process of teaching-learning programming concepts to students in the early years, as well for teenager’s students without any previous knowledge about programming concepts. This study aims to present the methodology used to carry out our experience and the results obtained with the development and implementation of gamification concepts in a free and open-source learning management system.

The group decided to focus primarily on formative assessment rather than summative assessment and high stakes testing. Formative assessments and feedback provide an important opportunity to support and enhance student learning. Recognizing shifts in education towards blended and online learning with problembased and inquiry-based approaches led to considerations of technologies that could effectively support formative assessment and informative feedback to 21st century learners. The paper concludes with a summary of conclusions and recommendations of the working group to be taken up in subsequent efforts.	information	J.

This paper describes the original web-based e-learning software, which enables teaching and learning of the optical link design. Optical link design is an iterative process involving trade-offs to achieve the desired performance: bit error rate, transmission distance, etc., at minimal cost. Fundamental elements of an optical fiber transmission link are the optical transmitter, the optical fiber with associated splices and connectors, and the optical receiver. The student must select appropriate devices from a set of available optical components to meet a given set of system requirements. Data concerning optical equipment that can be used for specific optical link design are stored in a database, that was created for the purpose of this software.	bit error rate;database;iterative and incremental development;iterative method;optical fiber;prototype;requirement;system requirements;transmitter;web application	Vladanka S.

cfe450a01f239a638dfc119fcc0bd4268b00a339	service science in higher education: productization of offshore programs in transnational education		One of the forms in service innovation for universities in Taiwan is to develop transnational education such as offshore programs where the existent programs were re-innovated by providing new service processes including improved delivery or distribution methods. This study examined how the universities adopted this form of innovation and examined how they productize their offshore programs, corresponding to the four productization practices: specifying, tangibilizing, systemizing and standardizing, in terms of program design, curriculum design, teaching and learning, assessment, and administration. By these productization practices, students and partner universities can have a clearer picture and better understanding of the programs, and the host universities can cut down the administration cost and achieve better efficiency and cost-benefit. This study can be seen as a pioneering study which applies the service science philosophy to redefine higher education and reformulate the process of the service innovation such as offshore program implementation by the productization practices.	service innovation	Pi-Yun Chen;Ming-Hsiung Hsiao	2014	IJSSMET	10.4018/ijssmet.2014100101	engineering management;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;electrical engineering;marketing;software engineering;mechanical engineering	SE	-78.19575182096888	-28.762048682281605	28080

Comparing and contrasting is the process of looking at similarities and differences in order to reveal important characteristics of two objects, systems, organizations, events, processes or concepts. In comparing and contrasting two subjects, we identify relevant factors for comparison, discuss both similarities and differences between the two subjects with respect to each of these factors, investigate if there are any patterns in the similarities and differences, and make a conclusion based on this investigation. A skillful use of compare and contrast yields greater and deeper understanding of what is being taught. The conclusion drawn from compare and contrast can also help in designing a better system or process. Using a set of carefully chosen examples, we demonstrate that critical thinking skills can be naturally introduced in the course content of computer curricula at tertiary level. It is expected that infusion of critical thinking skills into course content and their explicit introduction stimulates students thinking and improves their learning ability.	data structure;process (computing)	M.

The collected data were analysed using both linear and multiple regression analysis. The results showed that perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment are positively and significantly related to the behavioural intention to use social networking sites as a job search tool, whereas perceived ease of use is not positively and significantly related. The study implies that the developers of social networking sites need to provide additional useful functionalities or tools in the social networking sites to help users of social networking sites with their job search. The paper provides an insight for employed jobseekers to find employment by using social networking sites as a job search tool.	sampling (signal processing);usability	Norazah Mohd Suki;Thurasamy Ramayah;Michelle Kow Pei Ming;Norbayah Mohd Suki	2011	IJTHI	10.4018/jthi.2011040105	public relations;social science;job attitude;knowledge management;sociology;social psychology;computer-mediated communication;social network	HCI	-74.94807384796883	-41.22123564187413	28190
61f810b3cbec7bf050f964ff069a05ac2f883303	gender bias in artificial intelligence: the need for diversity and gender theory in machine learning		Artificial intelligence is increasingly influencing the opinions and behavior of people in everyday life. However, the over-representation of men in the design of these technologies could quietly undo decades of advances in gender equality. Over centuries, humans developed critical theory to inform decisions and avoid basing them solely on personal experience. However, machine intelligence learns primarily from observing data that it is presented with. While a machine's ability to process large volumes of data may address this in part, if that data is laden with stereotypical concepts of gender, the resulting application of the technology will perpetuate this bias. While some recent studies sought to remove bias from learned algorithms they largely ignore decades of research on how gender ideology is embedded in language. Awareness of this research and incorporating it into approaches to machine learning from text would help prevent the generation of biased algorithms. Leading thinkers in the emerging field addressing bias in artificial intelligence are also primarily female, suggesting that those who are potentially affected by bias are more likely to see, understand and attempt to resolve it. Gender balance in machine learning is therefore crucial to prevent algorithms from perpetuating gender ideologies that disadvantage women.	algorithm;artificial intelligence;embedded system;fairness measure;gender hci;machine learning;undo	Susan Leavy	2018	2018 IEEE/ACM 1st International Workshop on Gender Equality in Software Engineering (GE)	10.1145/3195570.3195580	gender schema theory;disadvantage;political science;stereotypy (non-human);training set;machine learning;undo;ideology;everyday life;text mining;artificial intelligence	AI	-86.13839759108366	-26.09368196855769	28268

As a case study and proof of concept we look at the DLE of Radboud University, Nijmegen by studying how it was implemented and how it has made the learning process more efficient. We show some figures that give an impression of the effects of the DLE on learning.

Undergraduates entering college today are young adults who have been exposed to the electronic environment, if only through arcade games.

The analysis is based on questionnaire study, carried out in 2007. The theoretical framework of the article has been inspired by Everett Rogers' innovation diffusion theory. It appears that there exists a statistically reliable difference between innovators and the remaining adopter categories among VET teachers. One can see that in the context of the VET teachers' working environment, a multi-dimensional innovation gap appears, embracing gaps in the actual use of e-learning tools, different types of skills and competences, access and support indicators. The model of innovativeness constructed shows that the competences are predictors of innovativeness. The development of competences related to e-learning (ICT competence, e-learning competence, pedagogical competence) and innovativeness are closely related. It will be argued that while one of the challenges for the developers of e-learning is to provide teachers with relevant continuous training as well as making efforts in developing existing support structures, we can assume that for different adopter categories among teachers different strategies and support schemes should be applied, as the values and attitudes of different groups vary.

At the core of the investigations presented in this paper lie fundamental questions associated with the role of affective considerations in computer-mediated educational interactions. Theory of linguistic politeness is used as the basis for determining the contextual factors relevant to human tutors’s actions, with special attention being dedicated to learner affective states. A study was designed to determine what affective states of the learners are relevant to tutoring mathematics and to identify the mechanisms used by tutors to predict such states. Logs of tutor-student dialogues were recorded along with contextual factors taken into consideration by tutors in relation to their specific tutorial dialogue moves. The logs were annotated in order to determine the types and range of student and tutor actions. Machine learning techniques were then applied to those actions to predict the values of three factors: student confidence, interest and effort. Whilst due to limited size and sparsity of data the results are not conclusive, they are very valuable as the basis for empirically derived hypotheses to be tested in further studies. The potential implications of the hypotheses, if they were confirmed by further studies, are discussed in relation to the impact of tutor’s ability to diagnose student affect on the nature of computer-mediated tutorial interactions.	interaction;machine learning;sparse matrix;while	Kaska Porayska-Pomsta;Manolis Mavrikis;Helen Pain	2007	User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction	10.1007/s11257-007-9041-x	computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;computer-mediated communication;affect	HCI	-74.64680204870616	-45.707274021969575	28506

It has become consensus of scholars that coding ability is important to computer science education, and programming exercises can improve teaching quality efficiently. However, this consensus more relies on the expert's experience and intuition. It¿s lack of quantifiable indicators or empirical data to support the consensus. In this paper, event studies are used to analysis the effect of programming exercises to teaching quality. The results show that the improvement of students¿ coding ability can effectively improve teaching quality of computer science courses.	computer science;consensus (computer science);experience	Xiaoguang Liu;Gang Wang;Jing Liu	2008	2008 International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering	10.1109/CSSE.2008.319	event study;data structure;computer science;multimedia	SE	-83.79326131435947	-36.16022917721517	28526

This article provides a detailed case study of the development of the HELP-Stats package for learning psychological statistics. HELP-Stats was developed from an existing 10 week laboratory-based statistics course and is intended to provide a complete replication of the desirable aspects of the laboratory classes while adding the immediate feedback, computational support, and adaptive help available in good CAL programs. Controlled evaluations of the effect and affect of the HELP-Stats stacks indicated that even the somewhat inadequate prototypes were more fun and at least as effective as traditional laboratory teaching. Analysis of the costs and benefits suggests that, given careful software engineering, the development costs are comparable with traditional CAL development costs and that the benefits include significant pedagogical and administrative advantages, together with potential resource savings for larger classes or repeated use.	hypercard	Roderick I.

Such a program offers professional growth and development opportunities to university faculty, new corporate relationships for both the professors and the university, and the opportune moment for exciting explorations into the areas of curriculum development, evaluation methodology, and teaching styles. The design of an effective computer education program can be an important addition to a university's overall educational mandate. Key issues for any successful computer education include curriculum development, instructional design, course development, delivery of instruction, evaluation, and overall project management. This paper provides some guidelines for those who desire to design successful PC computer education. Under the author's direction, over 1,000 days of education have been provided to approximately 7,500 individuals during the past three years. The impact of such a program on the lives of the professors involved and the corporate clients receiving the education, has been enormous.

Eighty-six freshmen enrolled in English courses participated i n this control-group pretest-posttest experiment, and received either traditional or conc ept-mapping instruction for learning English reading skills. A concept-mapping strategy was introduced to the learners in the experimental group to improve their reading ability . The results of independent t tests, in which eye-tracking data on fixation time and fixati on path were used, indicated that the participants who received concept-mapping instructi on exhibited shorter fixation times on the core concept and other content in the text, compare d with the group that received traditional instruction. Moreover, the experimental group demon strated longer and irregular rereading paths than the control group (CG) did. These result s indicated that concept mapping serves as a reference to assist average readers to improve an d to identify primary ideas that clarify the meaning of an article.	concept map;experiment;eye tracking;line printer daemon protocol	Pei-Lin Liu	2014	Computers & Education	10.1016/j.compedu.2014.05.011	computer science;multimedia;communication;pedagogy	NLP	-76.65234408063952	-42.23681460449292	28736

One such system is the intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs). ITSs center on individualized learning and do not consider the situation where learners can learn beyond the teacherlearner relationship. Several learning companion systems (LCS) were implemented to create social learning environments. However these systems are merely extensions of tutor agents and act as “learners”. In this paper, we introduce the use of learner agents both as student modeling systems and as peers.	computer program	Teresita Limoanco;Raymund Sison	2002		10.1109/CIE.2002.1186236	agent architecture;social learning;simulation;intelligent decision support system;computer science;knowledge management;software agent;multimedia;pedagogy	AI	-80.92139605765566	-43.6599958568522	28963

This approach adopts its structure from existing intelligent tutoring systems and introduces a new component called pedagogical scenario model to support pedagogical flexibility in the adaptation process of courseware generation system. The adaptation is carried out using Dynamic Constraint Satisfaction Problem framework, which is a variant of classical Constraint Satisfaction Problem, to deliver courseware tailored to individual learner. Such a framework provides a high level of expressiveness to deal with the particular characteristics of courseware generation problem. Further, it automatically designs a sound courseware satisfying the design constraints imposed by the domain, the pedagogical scenario and learner models.	constraint satisfaction problem;high-level programming language	Hend Ben Hadji;Ho-Jin Choi;Mohamed Jemni	2012	Int.

An engineer attempting to select which job to run on a processor, a curriculum designer deciding which instructors are available for a semester and a shop manager trying to optimize an assembly line are all trying to solve problems with an underlying similarity: they all are attempting to determine the best way to allocate limited resources over time. Whether dealing with servers that break down, teachers going on vacation, or defective widgets on the line, each issue must be dealt with by analyzing times, availabilities, difficulties and other constraining parameters of the generic problem of resource allocation. In this book, authors Yves Robert and Frederic Vivien put together a series of essays on scheduling problems, solutions, and performance guarantees, from many of the top experts in the field.	algorithm;job shop scheduling;robert;scheduling (computing)	Ben Fulton	2012	SIGACT News	10.1145/2421119.2421128	computer science;artificial intelligence	Theory	-65.01600296778375	-26.110655448454505	29055

This research study deals with the question which practical uses the e-book format EPUB3 offers for (higher) education. By means of a didactic content analysis, a range of interactive exercise types were developed as a result of conversations with teachers. For this purpose, a didactic and technical concept has been developed. Different kinds of exercises were prototypically implemented in an e-book. Finally, a brief overview reflects the present state of the current e-book readers. A subsequent discussion illuminates the strengths and weaknesses of the format. In summary, it can be remarked that EPUB3 is suitable for a variety of different exercises and that it is able to serve as a basic format for forthcoming digital textbooks. Furthermore the openness of EPUB3 will assist Open Learning and Teaching in a meaningful way.	cascading style sheets;e-book;e-reader;epub;field research;html5;high-level programming language;interactivity;javascript;openness;prototype;requirement	Martin Ebner;Christian Gailer;Mohammad Khalil;Michael Kopp;Elke Lackner;Michael Raunig	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-11200-8_71	computer science;artificial intelligence;multimedia;interactivity	HCI	-68.0120166626315	-37.64909812678982	29097

It has already been applied in educational fields, although its usefulness and usability have not always being empirically tested and validated. This paper proposes the development of an AR software helping Computer Engineering students understand concepts and processes in embedded systems during laboratory exercises. The design of the software's field of action has been realized taking into account a task taxonomy, based on research in cognitive and educational psychology, and students' needs established using questionnaires and interviews. The AR software has been developed under the premises of reliability, robustness and handiness. Its effectiveness and usability will be initially evaluated within the consortium of the project. Afterwards, using this feedback, the software will be further improved and introduced in real laboratory practices at universities.	augmented reality;computer engineering;embedded system;feedback;prototype;robustness (computer science);software prototyping;taxonomy (general);usability	Jorge R.

Using a case study, we explore EUD in the domain of community computing. Situated in community computing context, we identify design requirements of EUD tools, demonstrate the use of conceptual scaffolds to support EUD, and illustrate the need of new evaluation methods of EUD tools. We discuss the tension between pushing EUD tools to community computing for local autonomy on technology issues and the long time practice of seeking and relying on external technical expertise. We call for research studies that address the tension and explore ways of creating and stimulating “pull” force from the community groups."""	end-user development;requirement	Lu Xiao;Umer Farooq	2013	J.

Not only would such a system offer savings in training costs, but it would also provide productivity gains due to the user’s increase in performance—the ultimate aim of Electronic Performance Support Systems. How realistic is this goal, and how cost-effective is an EPSS in reality? In spite of a number of success stories, this question is difficult to answer with certainty, especially in a pre-project phase when the intent is to determine if an organization should go ahead with an EPSS project. The large number of factors to consider and the lack of data to help predict results make it difficult to quantify the return on investment for an EPSS. The objective this article is to provide some empirical data on this subject by using cost-benefit data based on the analysis of a potential EPSS project for a large electric utility company. We hope the findings will give some generalizable results and that the method can be reused for the purpose of conducting EPSS cost-benefit analyses. How can the benefits and return on investment of an EPSS be determined in advance?	best, worst and average case;fear, uncertainty and doubt;modulation;web content development	Michel C.

8648a68203e9ef3245b19fe61cafa8517b4cdcde	code notes: designing a low-cost tangible coding tool for/with children		Programming has become an essential subject for today's education curriculum and as a result, the importance of creating the right environments to teach is increasing. For such environments, featuring tangible tools enhances creativity and collaboration. However, due to their high prices, current tangible tools are not reachable by most of the students. We developed Code Notes as a low-cost, attainable and tangible tool aimed to motivate children to support programming education. Code Notes is comprised of an Android app and code-cardboards to teach the basic concepts in programming. We continue to develop the platform with insights gained from children. This paper shares the design phases of Code Notes and observations from our two-month programming project. We also presented some future concepts of Code Notes that offer an active and embodied interaction with the teaching material.	android;book;ibm notes;interaction;list of educational programming languages;mobile phone;open-source software;reachability	Alpay Sabuncuoglu;Merve Erkaya;Oguz Turan Buruk;Tilbe Göksun	2018		10.1145/3202185.3210791	multimedia;human–computer interaction;curriculum;coding (social sciences);android (operating system);creativity;computer science;embodied cognition	HCI	-66.19319864991827	-40.857887768340575	29464

3bf5a848f0f04650e7a35d968b9c0266496a6622	the construction of cultural impressions for the idea of cultural products		What determines if a product is perceived as a cultural artefact? What impressions of a product result in consumers’ impressions of cultural creativity? David Hume in his book Treatise of Human Nature claimed the perceptions of the human mind resolved themselves into two distinct kinds, impressions and ideas. He claimed that simple impressions always take precedence over their corresponding ideas. Hume brought up seven fundamental relations between impressions and ideas, (1) Resemblance, (2) Identity, (3) Space and time, (4) Proportions in quantity, (5) Degrees in quality, (6) Contrariety, and (7) Cause and effect. Based on the perspective of Hume’s theory of relation, a questionnaire was developed to obtain information required for style analysis in this study. Through the statistical techniques of Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and Multiple Regression Analysis, this study explored the cultural impressions of 10 prominent Taiwan cultural products selected from the domestic market. The results of the study suggested that Hume’s theory of seven fundamental relations could be applied to interpret the connections between impressions and ideas regarding viewers’ perception of the cultural features of a product. Of the seven relations, (5) Degrees in quality contributed significant positive weight to a product’s cultural feature. The relation (6) Contrariety demonstrated the diversity within all seven relations.

The Experimental Advanced Instructional Design Advisor (XAIDA), a simple ITS shell, was evaluated in a study of 17 Air Force medical-technician trainers. The study examined XAIDA's learnability, usability, and acceptability to the participants using a one-week combined training and evaluation program. All participants were able to produce courseware using XAIDA. Measures of cognitive structure indicated that their conception of XAIDA's features became more similar to that of an expert as the result of training. Performance tests, skill ratings and usability ratings indicated that XAIDA is both usable and learnable. Participant's attitudes were generally positive except at a point when training required a difficult cognitive shift. Attitudes remained focused througout training on personal and low-level concerns, indicating the participants were not likely to be early adapters of the technology. The results have implications for the deployment of ITS shells in operational environments.		Brenda M. Wenzel;Mary T. Dirnberger;Pat Y. Hsieh;Tom J. Chudanov;Henry M.

The first solution, called Virtual Conference, is designed and implemented in the framework of the VirRAD European project. It is a two-dimensional space where participants represented by their photos can use various e-collaboration tools. The second solution, called EVE Training Area, is a three-dimensional space where participants, represented by 3D humanoid avatars, can use a variety of e-collaboration tools. This paper describes the functionality provided by both tools, compares them, and proposes cases for exploiting each solution.	avatar (computing);exploit (computer security);haptic technology;multi-user;television;virtual community;virtual reality;web application	Christos Bouras;Eri Giannaka;Thrasyvoulos Tsiatsos	2005	Fifth IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT'05)	10.1109/ICALT.2005.113	learning community;distance education;three-dimensional space;educational technology;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;artificial intelligence;instructional simulation;virtual reality;multimedia;management;world wide web	Visualization	-69.60186192203167	-38.44475089747355	29752

This problem is often exacerbated by the need for students to develop significant system infrastructure, requiring them to spend time addressing issues which may be orthogonal to the AI course’s core pedagogical goals. This paper argues that such problems can be alleviated by basing coding assignments on paradigm-specific frameworks, collections of reusable code designed to be extended and applied to a variety of specific problems. In addition, frameworks can provide a basis for further student research or application of projects to real-world domains, providing additional motivation. This paper illustrates the application of a framework-based approach to teaching case-based reasoning (CBR), introducing the Indiana University Case-Based Reasoning Framework (IUCBRF), discussing its design, and presenting sample exercises that take advantage of the framework’s characteristics.	algorithm;artificial intelligence;case-based reasoning;code reuse;programming paradigm;usability	Steven Bogaerts;David B.

The level of abstractness-concreteness of an icon and its effect upon performance is of widespread interest. The authors have devised a quantitative measure for abstractness based on the complexity of the icon. They test their metric against subjective judgments of abstractness as identified by two different groups of subjects. After ranking two sets of ‘abstract’ and ‘concrete’ icons, the authors examined how well the icons were matched to the Pascal constructs that they represented. Further experiments were conducted using different groups of subjects to check whether correct matching of the icons with constructs was influenced by context. In summary the authors found that their metric was a good match for subjective measures of abstractness-concreteness. They also found that there is a better identification of concrete icons than abstract icons. Finally, it was shown that context does affect the correct identification of icons.

Has the reformative, humanistic and emancipatory role that many educators have envisaged for ICT in education been realized in the reality of classrooms? Bearing in mind these two critical questions, the present paper attempts to approach the visionary narrative of the so-called information society (in recent times also referred to as knowledge society) and the rhetoric underlying the role of ICT as an agent for change and a substitute for education. Latest international facts and figures are examined with the purpose of assessing the realization of this role and raising critical arguments against the idea of perceiving ICT as the totem of educational change. From this evidence, it is argued that educational media and tools cannot revolutionize, but can only strengthen, further and reinforce established educational goals, curriculum contents, teaching and learning methods. This leads us to conclude that, as the educational use of ICT becomes assimilated, it mirrors and to a certain degree broadens or exacerbates prevailing socio-economic problems and current educational conditions. Thus the main focus of the paper is to attempt to redefine and re-approach the role of ICT from a human and democratic standpoint. It concentrates on ICT success stories, which seem to whisper the critical pedagogy tale. These stories serve as an avenue for reflecting upon the liberating possibilities of ICT, which can flourish when they are embedded in an alternative and progressive educational setting. In such an educational context, ICT represents an interesting, challenging and essential educational theme, one of the necessary keys for unlocking, understanding and participating in a competitive, demanding and insecure world. On the other hand, critical use of ICT tools enhances, promotes and extends democratic curriculum practices, processes and structures by offering students and teachers a multiple set of media and tools for expression, interaction, creation, reflection, analysis, construction, communication and meaning making. Focusing on students’ participation in common life as critical, knowledgeable, conscious and able citizens appears to bring about a new conception of ICT, namely a critical pedagogy and pedagogy of praxis perspective towards ICT. Yet, for such a focus to prevail we need to change our view of what it means to educate and what it means to be educated.	altran praxis;embedded system;interaction;knowledge society;mind;reflection (computer programming)	Helen Drenoyianni	2006	Education and Information Technologies	10.1007/s10639-006-9005-5	psychology;social science;progressive education;critical pedagogy;sociology;management;economic growth;pedagogy	HCI	-72.33911350237545	-31.35768455318167	29994

The combination of this invention yields a structure wherein the tire will operate normally under normal conditions of load and pressure and will operate with the load equally distributed on each sidewall of the tire during run flat operation. In this invention, the tire has an asymmetric sidewall construction resulting from the inclusion of rubber inserts in its sidewalls of different bulk and the rim has axially outward extending rim flange extensions which are angled in relation to the axis of rotation of the rim. The extensions are angled in opposite directions. The proper combination of these features compensates for the camber that the tire is subjected to when it is run flat.	library and information science	Dennis N.

Through convenient and flexible mobile terminals and network, researchers and developers strive to provide users with teaching and learning resources and services that can be accessible anytime anywhere. This paper describes the design and implementation of a mobile learning system that can deliver live broadcast of realtime classroom teaching to online students with mobile devices. The system allows students to customize their ways of receiving, based on when and where they are tuning into the broadcast. To increase interactivity between the instructor and online students in large classes, the system also supports short text-messaging and instant polls. Through these venues, students can ask questions and make suggestions in real time, and the instructor can address them immediately	anytime algorithm;interactivity;mobile computing;mobile device;performance tuning	Hongru Qi;Minjuan Wang;Ren Tong;Ruimin Shen;Jiajun Wang;Yi Gao	2006	Sixth IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT'06)	10.1109/ICALT.2006.307	mobile search;simulation;computer science;operating system;wireless network;mobile device;multimedia;mobile computing	Robotics	-68.66210859483635	-40.56412394211807	30098

The paper reviews various criteria that help in the creation of such an environment for students. Based on the readings, the author has developed a framework encompassing the main elements of a supportive learning environment. A questionnaire was administered to students from six institutes. It was found that instructional, peer, institutional, and technical support play a key role in the creation of a supportive environment for the student. The results of this study can be used by educationists and management committees of universities/institutes to provide an effective learning environment for the students.	technical support	Gayatri Venugopal-Wairagade	2016	2016 International Conference on Learning and Teaching in Computing and Engineering (LaTICE)	10.1109/LaTiCE.2016.26	engineering;knowledge management;multimedia;pedagogy	SE	-75.92229928849888	-36.33583172391568	30135

38bd4997e43670b888bf80b52c10af49954958c8	an intelligent learning support system		Fast-growing technologies are shaping many aspects of societies. Educational systems, in general, are still rather traditional: learner applies for school or university, chooses the subject, takes the courses, and finally graduates. The problem is that labor markets are constantly changing and the needed professional skills might not match with the curriculum of the educational program. It might be that it is not even possible to learn a combination of desired skills within one educational organization. For example, there are only a few universities that can provide high-quality teaching in several different areas. Therefore, learners may have to study specific modules and units somewhere else, for example, in massive open online courses. A person, who is learning some particular content from outside of the university, could have some knowledge gaps which should be recognized. We argue that it is possible to respond to these challenges with adaptive, intelligent, and personalized learning systems that utilize data analytics, machine learning, and Semantic Web technologies. In this paper, we propose a model for an Intelligent Learning Support System that guides learner during the whole lifecycle using semantic annotation methodology. Semantic annotation of learning materials is done not only on the course level but also at the content level to perform semantic reasoning about the possible learning gaps. Based on this reasoning, the system can recommend extensive learning material.	fast-growing hierarchy;internet;knowledge base;knowledge level;machine learning;massive open online course;noise shaping;open-source software;personalization;semantic web;user profile	Mariia Gavriushenko;Oleksiy Khriyenko;Ari Tuhkala	2017		10.5220/0006252102170225	error-driven learning;intelligent decision support system	AI	-76.75752437401009	-36.32923357997286	30164

Online mentoring may help ameliorate this situation. To test this assumption, a one-year personal mentoring program for eleven to eighteen-year-old female collegepreparatory students was evaluated. Mentee and mentor communicate with one another and with other program participants via email, online chat, and forums. To measure program effectiveness, we randomly assigned participants (N 1⁄4 312) to either a treatment group (N 1⁄4 208) or a waiting-list control group (N 1⁄4 104). We collected questionnaire data at three points in time. In comparison to the waitinglist group, the treatment-group participants showed greater levels of desirable short-term and long-term developments. Our findings indicate various advantages for online mentoring for promoting girls’ interests in STEM. 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Analyses of data provided by 32 participants have helped us to establish the applicability of using a learning schedule for retrieving a learner’s location and available time contexts. This understanding was required in order to determine the realistic usability and potential deployment of our mobile context-aware learning schedule (mCALS) framework, which uses a learner’s schedule (i.e. electronic organizer) to retrieve their location and available time contexts. The purpose of this framework is to suggest appropriate learning materials to students based on the values of the proposed contexts (including learning styles, knowledge level, concentration level and frequency of interruption, at the point of usage). The study suggests that the framework should include verification methods to counter against the possibility of students not adhering precisely to their planned learning schedules. Motivation was established as a crucial learning context which should be incorporated into adaptive mobile learning applications.	canonical account;context awareness;diary studies;electronic organizer;emoticon;global positioning system;interrupt;java;knowledge level;mobile device;software deployment;usability	Jane Yau;Mike Joy;Stephan Dickert	2010	Educational Technology & Society		questionnaire;proactive learning;multi-task learning;educational technology;error-driven learning;simulation;interview;time management;human–computer interaction;computer science;operating system;mobile device;multimedia;data analysis;location;scheduling;world wide web;active learning;synchronous learning;pedagogy	HCI	-74.82890399242855	-48.319446689771354	30212

A traditional model including only past performance on the test yielded an R of 0.38 and an enhanced traditional model that added current class average improved predictions (R=0.50). These models served as baseline measures for comparing an ITS model. Logistic regression models that include features such as hint percentage, average number of attempts and percent correct overall improved the R to 0.57. The predictive power of the data is as effective with only a few months of use. This lends support for the increased use of the systems in the classroom and for nightly homework.	baseline (configuration management);logistic regression;r language	Kim M. Kelly;Ivon Arroyo;Neil T.

Conventional language education systems offer exercises for fixed phrases or conversation practice using predetermined dialog patterns. Ideally, the learners should participate in a dialog that dynamically changes in accordance with the utterances of the participants, and they should decide what to say by themselves according to the changing environment. Such a learning environment needs a teacher to participate in the dialog and help the learners continue the conversation even if their utterances are ungrammatical. This research aims to construct a system that plays a teacher role of this kind. This paper is concerned with how to develop a system that accepts and interprets both grammatical and ungrammatical inputs.

They have re‐defined the concept of “bibliographic instruction” in which the connotation “library” is implicit, but has become inadequate in a digital library context. This article relates the results of pilot studies of Internet use in academic libraries in the New York metropolitan area to the education of users in a digital library environment. It attempts to crystallize vital concepts and issues generated by interviewing users and information professionals, which could not be quantified in an earlier publication.

However, developing such knowledge is difficult, especially for newly formed groups participating in a computer-supported collaboration. The solution for this problem described in this paper is to provide to group members access to the knowledge structures and the information resources of their collaboration partners in the form of digital concept maps. In an empirical study, 20 triads having access to such maps and 20 triads collaborating without such maps are compared regarding their group performance in problem-solving tasks. Results showed that the triads being provided with such concept maps acquired more knowledge about the others’ knowledge structures and information, focused while collaborating mainly on problem-relevant information, and therefore, solved the problems faster and more often correctly, compared to triads with no access to their collaborators’ maps.	concept map;problem solving	Tanja Engelmann;Friedrich W.

71fc80559ed1d7c50c2f35009904639c66f0bcf5	a model for quality of schooling	bayes net;school quality;causal models	A key challenge for policymakers in many developing countries is to decide which intervention or collection of interventions works best to improve learning outcomes in their schools. Our aim is to develop a causal model that explains student learning outcomes in terms of observable characteristics as well as conditions and processes difficult to observe directly. We start with a theoretical model based on the results of previous research, direct experience and experts’ knowledge in the field. This model is then refined through application of supervised learning methods to available data sets. Once calibrated with local data in a country, the model estimates the probability that a given intervention would affect learning outcomes.	causal model;observable;supervised learning;theory	Massoud Moussavi;Noel McGinn	2010			computer science;machine learning;bayesian network;data mining;management science;statistics;causal model	ML	-76.94768438360694	-48.680725045957495	30416

This is the motto of the Game Design Workshop subject I run at the University of New South Wales. The class brings together artists and programmers to learn about designing games. To do this, we play games. Then we reflect on why they work. Then we change the rules and play some more. Reflecting on this experience helps us to learn the principles behind designing good games.  In this paper I share some of the games we have played. I have deliberately chosen these games to illustrate key elements of game design, while also being fun to play, and easy to change. My experience shows that they provide an effective way to teach concepts which students can transfer to the analysis and design of more complex games.	feedback;pc game;play store;programmer;video game design	Malcolm Ryan	2007		10.1145/1367956.1367977	video game design;mathematics education;combinatorial game theory;games;simulation;4x;turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games;computer science;emergent gameplay;game mechanics;game art design;metagaming;game developer;multimedia;video game development	HCI	-67.93577404833121	-35.48701628427473	30418

As most courses only emphasize the cognitive aspects of the class and neglect the course’s effect on the students, this gives no help for reaching the affective domain teaching goals. Especially for younger students, in distance education, when younger students are out of the sight of teachers, they could easily be distracted by the environment around them. This research outlines a synchronous discussion procedure with reinforcement mechanism designed for elementary school students to integrate the affective aspects of teaching into distance education within a class period. The mechanism allows teachers to understand students’ attitudes within the class and provides instant feedback to the teacher. Learners can also get information about their attitudes and help to reach the affective domain teaching goals of the courses. This mechanism was implemented and investigated. Comparative assessments were made by administering interviews and questionnaires to elementary school students. The results show that the procedure can supervise learners and help them reach the response stage of the affective domain teaching goals. 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

449461ba3bf28b3d3c24271abddff45236ac2f8c	an exploratory study of game-based m-learning for software project management	journal article;drntu engineering computer science and engineering software	Given that the virtues of m-learning have not yet been fully exploited in teaching Software Project Management (SPM), this paper embarks on a timely endeavour to explore the use of game-based m-learning for SPM by introducing a game called Mobile Application for Project management LEarning (MAPLE). A total of 55 graduate students were invited to participate in the evaluation study carried out for the MAPLE application. The evaluation was based on three design principles derived from the literature, namely, motivation, gaming and learning. Based on the preliminary evaluation, three major observations could be culled. One, game-based m-learning is a useful and an entertaining augmentation to traditional learning. Two, design principles namely motivation, gaming and learning and their appropriate blending is necessary to develop an effective m-learning game. Finally, appealing features in MAPLE are risk alerts, avatar creation and feedback.	alpha compositing;endeavour (supercomputer);exploratory testing;field research;information;maple;noise shaping;programming paradigm;social media;software feature;software project management;super paper mario;tablet computer;text-based (computing);usability;venue (sound system);ipad	Alton Yeow-Kuan Chua;Radhika Shenoy Balkunje	2012	J.

We set a hypothesis that visual simulators will be evaluated by the students as preferred tool for learning in comparison to the online learning tool realized to assess the student knowledge. In this paper, we present the results of a survey to analyze the student satisfaction of introducing these e-learning tools. Our goal was to evaluate the usability and benefits of implemented interactive tools by analyzing anonymous and realistic student feedback. It will give a better understanding about the type of course organization and enable us to make proper decisions about the best learning model suited to the students need and requirements, especially in the case when the course is in the first study year.	best practice;computer architecture;computer science;online machine learning;requirement;simulation;usability;visual learning	Goce Armenski;Magdalena Kostoska;Sasko Ristov;Marjan Gusev	2014	2014 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON)	10.1109/EDUCON.2014.6826159	educational technology;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia;synchronous learning	Visualization	-80.31821084974708	-41.66672381155101	30527

7c45145a7bf1571b6c0024fa2ada100dda0d57e0	teaching undergraduate nursing students renal care in a 3d gaming environment		The original program on renal care was developed between 1995-1997 using 'Toolbook' software, which presented the content in a non interactive graphical way without tracking student progress or recording of results and was available to students via a CDRom. The content described the clinical decision making process that practitioners had to follow when diagnosing and managing renal diseases. These processes followed a learning sequence whereby a series of decisions lead to the next phase of the diagnosis and treatment. The purpose was to simulate the live clinical decision making processes for practitioners. An additional build-in 'Ask the Expert'-button (Help function) guided students in correct clinical decision making. One of the problems encountered in the original program is that the navigation is not intuitive to the user and students could get easily lost while going through the step-by-step introduction as well as the lack of interactivity. The original program still has relevant learning content, but the software, illustrations and tracking of learning outcomes are out-of-date. Therefore a re-design of the original program using a 3D Gaming Environment with updated content is being undertaken. This paper will discuss the methodology underpinning the new development, a demonstration of the program and the results from student feedback which will be undertaken in February - March 2009.

The writers of the CBT materials are expected to be familiar with document creation tools, but might have relatively little experience with CBT authoring tools. The keys to the strategy are modularity and recycling. Training materials created for print are adapted, first for passive online presentation, then for interactive computer-based training. In each adaptation, the materials are modified to suit a different environment or application of the product being described. The subject matter and educational objectives are not modified. The presentation will discuss the rationale for the recommended strategy and outline the steps in the process by which it is executed, illustrating the process with examples.	certified broadcast technologist;core-based trees;design rationale;game demo;modularity (networks);subject matter expert turing test;surround sound	Kay Palkhivala;Cynthia Bowllan;Thomas Barnwell	1999		10.1145/318372.318585	reusability;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;operating system;software engineering;modularity;multimedia;interactivity;world wide web	HCI	-78.64187107141494	-37.5560175093841	30583

The host laboratory was responsible for all preparations needed to allow the participating organizations to conduct subjective speech quality tests on the floating point hardware version of the 16 kbit/s LD-CELP coding algorithm. COMSAT was assisted by INTELSAT who provided funding, British Telecom and CPgD/Telebras (Brazilian Telecom Administration) who supplied personnel 1  and by AT&T, Bellcore, National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST, a part of the US Department of Commerce), Nippon Telegraph & Telephone (NIT), and Philips Communication Industry AG (PKI) which supplied hardware/software. Additionally, the host laboratory worked with 12 laboratories (see Table 1) which provided source speech material in 9 different languages and conducted the subjective and objective tests. These efforts spanned the period between October 1989 and July 1990 for Phase I and from February to mid-April 1991 for Phase 2. The purpose of this paper is to describe the host laboratory functions that COMSAT performed. We also describe the Write Once and Read Many times (WORM) based data interchange system, defined by Bellcore and COMSAT, that was used to exchange data efficiently (a total of about 16,000 Mbytes) between participating laboratories. Finally, we describe the Common Analog Interface, built by NIT, which was used to ensure that all tested codecs received equal treatment.		Frank Corcoran;Hiroshi Irii;John R.

497eed2bdc86d33dfea5231919fcdd5fa2011050	examining ubiquitous security-capital issues in implementing a campus-system-as-a-service(csaas) model in the cloud computing age: case study sub-saharan region	further education;cloud computing	The system was envisioned as a benchmarked model to build Campus-System-as-a-Service (CSaaS) in a cloud computing environment. The CSaaS architecture model demonstrated that building such a system requires strong improvements in security which in turn insists upon a huge budget to accomplish its objectives. The demand and acquisition of an exorbitant budget poses a challenge to the sub-Saharan institutions due to scarcity of resources. Nevertheless, a solution was sought. The concept of a consortium was put forth to combat their deficiencies. Some examples of these African consortia are: the Partnership for Higher Education in Africa, involving eight (8) universities; The Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in Western and Central Africa comprising a hundred (100) institutions, the initiatives for the formation of National Research and Education Network (NRENs), are but a few of such organizations. All such assemblages demonstrated the capacity of sub-Saharan campuses to pool their material, capital and human resources together in a way that would exploit technologies like cloud computing. The CSaaS architecture model demonstrates how the underlying consortium campuses can be connected through the CSaaS system to the cloud. Such a system would be capable of managing Campus Management Systems which would include: student registration, examinations, student results, students learning materials, library information, research, scholarships, admission information, undergraduate and postgraduate programmes, student recreation, website, eLearning, internship, alumina, timetable, campus strategic plan, institution estate, hostels, dining and kitchen, campus clinic/hospital, staffing, administration, etc. With such a huge range of applications, the consortium members would only pay for the services on demand. They would not be responsible for the provision of maintenance and services of hardware and software facilities.	benchmark (computing);cloud computing;computer security;emoticon;fm broadcasting;management system;national research and education network;schedule	Jameson Mbale;Kauna Mufeti;Victor Hamutenya	2012	2012 International Conference for Internet Technology and Secured Transactions		engineering management;simulation;engineering;management	HPC	-77.67133949296928	-29.370780699312206	30685

In addition some data will be presented which outlines contextual factors for the use of ICT in schools as a framework for implementing digital literacy in school curricula. The objective of this paper is to raise some awareness about what ‘digital literacy’ is, and start some discussion on its implications for the epistemological foundation of schooling and different subject domains.	digital rights management	Ola Erstad	2007			curriculum;norwegian;numeracy;pedagogy;national curriculum;digital literacy;information and communications technology;computer science	HCI	-73.78196628885026	-31.079762750508177	30707
1c8f45d03a479dcbf6e3cd5b5a7c2858765c83e6	a metric for healthcare technology management (hctm): e-surveying key executives and administrators of canadian teaching hospitals	healthcare;hospital performance;technology assessment;healthcare technology;technology management;abstraction ladder;health	Among key drivers of healthcare reform in Canadian society are the challenges faced by the rapid rate of technological change and its impact on organizational performance in terms of efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and innovation in business and operational processes. However, despite the noted significance of the impact of technological change on healthcare organizations, the challenge of healthcare technology management (HCTM) has received only scattered and marginal attention in the technology management (TM) literature. The lack of formalization in HCTM construct, attributes, and measures motivated an empirical study to develop a metric for HCTM. This metric was then used to assess HCTM practices in teaching hospitals across Canada. The project began with an analysis of developments to date in the fields of Management of Technology and Management of Medical Technology. An extensive literature content analysis generated a set of definitions and attributes of the conceptual TM construct, which was eventually extended to Chapter 6.15 A Metric for Healthcare Technology Management (HCTM): E-Surveying Key Executives and Administrators of Canadian Teaching Hospitals1 George Eisler BC Academic Health Council, Canada Joseph Tan Wayne State University, USA Samuel Sheps Western Regional Training Centre (WRTC) for Health Services Research & University of British Columbia, Canada Copyright © 2009, IGI Global, distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited. 1851 A Metric for HCTM HCTM. A measuring instrument was developed through a formal design process involving expert panel review, pilot testing, instrument refinement, and field-testing to extract and measure HCTM performance indicators. Administration of this metric with the help of the Association of Canadian Academic Health Organizations via a Web-based survey of senior healthcare administrators provided insights into the HCTM status of Canadian teaching hospitals and its relationship with organizational performance.	columbia (supercomputer);metric;marginal model;os-tan;refinement (computing);web	George Eisler;Joseph Tan;Samuel Sheps	2006	IJHISI	10.4018/jhisi.2006010101	health administration;medicine;knowledge management;technology management;nursing;health;management;technology assessment	HCI	-80.23843760668342	-30.190725549979568	30755

Initially the faculty of information technology developed a proposal for calculating academic workloads. This proposal reflected the rigid teacher centred learning structures of traditional on-campus delivery and made no allowance for the services required by off-campus students. In response, teachers of off-campus students developed a complementary proposal, based on actual time logs, which reflected their student centred approach to learning. Contrary to popular wisdom, off-campus teaching was found to be more time-consuming than on-campus.	online and offline	Wendy Doubé	2000		10.1145/330908.331883	distance education;simulation;computer science;knowledge management;teaching and learning center;teaching method;multimedia;information technology	HCI	-76.76988290734484	-36.996505916035474	30849

Our theoretical framework – mobile context-aware adaptive learning schedule (mCALS) was constructed. This uses a proactive approach – the learner’s schedule (i.e. an electronic organizer) to retrieve the location and time available contexts. Other contexts are also considered – learning styles, knowledge level, concentration level and frequency of interruption. Thereafter, appropriate learning materials are recommended to students based on this information.

Kolb identifies four learning orientations that individuals emphasize: abstract conceptualization, concrete experience, active experimentation and reflective observation. If learning orientations affects the efficiency in which students learn ERP systems in higher education are examined in this study. This is examined through a hypothetical deductive approach where two hypotheses are derived and tested. Quantitative data are collected through a questionnaire survey that was distributed to students at Stockholm University. Kolb’s Learning Style Inventory test is used to determine students learning orientation. The efficiency in which students learn ERP systems is measured by three variables: time spent, progress and problem frequency. In the findings correlations indicate that the learning orientation abstract conceptualization has a relation with the frequency that students encounter problems when working with exercises in ERP systems. Also the learning style active experimentation has a negative correlation with the number of hours students spend in the implementation of the exercises. It is suggested that all four learning orientations should be considered when designing learning environments for ERP systems and if the correlations found are to be used to change the learning environment it should be done with caution.	conceptualization (information science);erp;enterprise resource planning;level of measurement	Carl-Mikael Lönn	2011			computer science;knowledge management;multimedia	HCI	-75.1637667844282	-42.350091136643314	31014

IPS represents a powerful critical and alternative thinking skill we wish to instill in every graduate of the Bachelor of Arts in Information Management & Systems program at the University of South Carolina Upstate. A new three credit hour course teaching IPS, called SIMS 307: Systematic Innovation, has been added as a required course at the sophomore level. Some of the course material was adapted from an existing professional training class historically taught to post-baccalaureate working professionals with an average age of 35. Adapting the course for students with an average age of 20, very little professional experience, and only one year of college education has required much effort. This paper describes IPS and some of the challenges overcome in designing and delivering the course.	capability maturity model;ips panel;information management;lateral thinking;problem solving	Ron Fulbright	2011		10.1145/2047594.2047655	professional development;innovation;simulation;lateral thinking;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;management;law;information technology;pedagogy	PL	-78.6538069734719	-31.79432040919973	31055

The University of Minho (UM) has pioneered in this area in Portugal, adopting Blackboard as its official LMS. Moodle is also used in UM in scattered initiatives, allowing for interesting comparisons. Previous studies comparing Blackboard and Moodle have been confined to limited samples and focused on students’ perceptions only. In this paper, we also try to relate those perceptions to the impact of the LMSs on student level of engagement. We assess the extent and depth of use of the two LMSs, presenting the results of a study of students’ perceptions and experience with both Blackboard and Moodle. Unlike previous studies, more students (46.5%) stated a preference for Blackboard over Moodle, while 34.7% preferred Moodle, and nearly 20% had no preference. Factors that might explain these results are explored in some detail. By and large, a basic utilisation is made of both platforms, as little more than electronic document repositories, in what Francis and Raftery, in 2005, designate as a Mode 1 level of engagement. We could, however, detect some instances of a more sophisticated Mode 2 utilisation, particularly with Moodle, underlining the role of faculty in integrating a sophisticated use of LMSs when designing their courses. The use of learning management systems (LMSs) in learning environments In recent years, we have witnessed the growing introduction of LMSs in all levels of schooling in Portugal. Establishments using LMSs are still a minority (a little above 25% of universities according to a study by DeltaConsultores, 2007), but this should evolve rapidly. The use of information technology (IT) in schools and universities has been strongly supported by the government through initiatives ranging from primary schools to higher education that have encouraged the acquisition of laptop computers for students and teachers under favourable conditions and secured broadband connections in all public establishments. Around 960 000 laptop computers have been purchased by secondary school students and teachers, and about 370 000 by primary schools (GCELPT, 2009). Students entering universities nowadays will already have their own laptop computer with an Internet connection, and a growing number will have used an LMS in school.

Published by Blackwell Publishing, 9600 Garsington Road, Oxford OX4 2DQ, UK and 350 Main Street, Malden, MA 02148, USA. Despite the increase in LMS adoption in schools and universities, concern has been expressed as to whether LMSs are being used as effective learning tools or merely as electronic document repositories (Badge, Cann & Scott, 2005; Hall, 2006). Although there are some data on the overall adoption of LMSs in Portuguese schools and universities, very little is known as to how LMSs are used in practice. For example, we are yet to establish the extent to which this adoption is anywhere close to ‘sustainable embedding’, where e-learning is seen as ‘an accepted and expected part of teaching and learning’ (Nichols, 2008, p. 603). Hall (2006) argues that successful implementations of LMSs depend, not only on providing training and support for instructors, but also on the level of student active engagement and student and instructor satisfaction with the LMS used. The user perspective is therefore crucial to examine the implementation of LMSs and to evaluate their success. Francis and Raftery (2005, p. 2) distinguish among three e-learning modes of engagement, which correspond to growing levels of complexity and depth in LMS usage. Mode 1 is labelled ‘baseline course administration and learner support’, and illustrates situations where an LMS is used only ‘to distribute course information and carry out course administration’ and most learning activities occur in traditional classroom settings. In Mode 2, there is ‘blended learning leading to significant enhancements to learning and teaching processes’. This mode entails combining face-to-face interaction with a more widespread use of features such as: communication tools promoting interaction between tutor and students or among students; collaboration tools that assist students in the development of group work and otherwise allow for the sharing of learning resources; assessment tools, including the submission of graded assignments, the completion of quiz tests and the provision of feedback on work submitted; and finally, the inclusion of learning content that allows each student to independently further their learning at their own pace and specific interest. The third mode corresponds to a fully-fledged ‘online course/module’ where most learning will take place using the LMS, with extensive use of the tools described above and only marginal face-to-face interaction. These aspects affect the interpretation of data on LMS adoption. Nichols (2008) reveals considerable diversity among institutions in their progress towards e-learning sustainability. The fact that a learning platform is available, or that it is used extensively, does not necessarily mean they are used to similar levels of engagement. According to Hall (2006), most universities are at stage 1 of the Francis and Raftery (2005) model. Any comparison between alternative LMSs must also take into account the level of engagement to which they are being used. In this paper, we seek to assess the extent and depth of the use of different LMSs in the University of Minho (Portugal). Our research question is ‘Which are the perceptions and experiences of students in their use of Blackboard and Moodle?’ After reviewing previous studies that compare Blackboard and Moodle and explaining the University of Minho’s setting, we describe our data collection process. We then present our results, subsequently discussing them and drawing conclusions that contribute to the research purpose stated above. Comparing Blackboard and Moodle One of the most popular LMSs in Portugal is Moodle, an open source platform that ‘educators can use to create effective online learning sites’ (Moodle, n.d.). In 2007, it was used by 14% of Portuguese universities and most basic and secondary schools (DeltaConsultores, 2007). Moodle has actually become the standard LMS in public primary and secondary schools, and is encouraged by governmental projects. Blackboard has preferentially targeted universities, being the world leading proprietary LMS. It is used by a few Portuguese higher education institutions. Apart from the University of Minho, it has been adopted by five other universities and some polytechnic institutes. Student Perceptions of Blackboard and Moodle 825 © 2010 The Authors. British Journal of Educational Technology © 2010 Becta. Comparing these two LMSs is particularly interesting, not only because they are some of the more widely used platforms, but also because they present different features and functionalities that might be more or less adequate for different learning settings and objectives. Moreover, they represent quite different financial commitments to the institutions using them. We should not naïvely expect Moodle to be cost-free just because it is free to acquire and use. Administration and maintenance costs must be considered (Bremer & Bryant, 2005). However, Blackboard is certainly much more expensive to maintain as it incurs a yearly cost of licensing. The benefits and risks of adopting an open-source platform vis-a-vis a commercial one have been explored elsewhere (Britain & Liber, 1999). Evaluations of both Moodle (Gower & Barr, 2005; Graf & List, 2005) and Blackboard (Hall, 2006) on their own have also been produced exploring all the relevant technical issues. However, there are not many studies directly comparing users’ experience and evaluation of Moodle and Blackboard. Most such studies have been conducted within the growing number of universities across the world using Blackboard but considering open-source alternatives such as Moodle. On the whole, these studies seem to show a preference of users towards Moodle. Bremer and Bryant (2005) present results of a survey of 14 students, 80% of which state an overall preference for Moodle over Blackboard. In a study involving 84 education students in Hong Kong, Kennedy (2005) reports that 45% of students preferred Moodle over Blackboard, although the majority (49%) had no preference. Bos, Munoz and Van Duzer (2005) also show mixed results on their survey of 35 students. Moodle was favoured by students for its ability to promote interaction with fellow students and with the instructor; whereas, Blackboard was preferred in terms of the organisation of instructional materials. In the study by Machado and Tao (2007), however, course material organisation and communication were rated higher in Moodle than in Blackboard. The overall evaluation of the 53 students surveyed tended towards Moodle, 71% of them finding it easier to use than Blackboard and 75% stating that they would prefer to use Moodle in the future as a replacement for Blackboard. In a recently published report by the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, of a study involving 750 respondents, 44.5% of the students judged Moodle to be better than Blackboard and 27.2% preferred Blackboard; whereas, 26.9% stated no preference between them (University of Canterbury, 2008). On the whole, these studies suggest students tend to prefer Moodle over Blackboard, although to varying degrees. As for more detailed explanations of students’ preferences, these studies present more disparate and less comparable results. Moreover, other than the study by Canterbury University, they have been confined to rather limited student samples and focused primarily on students’ perceptions and opinions of particular aspects of the p	baseline (configuration management);blackwell (series);computer;expect;experience;francis;geforce 9 series;internet;laptop;marginal model;martin bryant (programmer);nichols plot;open-source software;pdf/a;visual instruction set	Ana Carvalho;Nelson Areal;Joaquim Silva	2011	BJET	10.1111/j.1467-8535.2010.01097.x	psychology;qualitative comparative analysis;knowledge management;instructional design;multimedia;sociology;pedagogy	HCI	-76.91494506620526	-33.18342980377227	31095

For example, an intelligent tutoring system may use such a model to estimate whether or not a student has mastered a skill. We analyze the significance of data recency in making such predictions, i.e., asking whether relatively more recent observations of a student’s performance matter more than relatively older observations. We investigate several representations of recency, such as the count of prior practice in the AFM model, and the proportion of recent successes with exponential and box kernels. We find that an exponential decay of a proportion of successes provides the summary of recent practice with the highest predictive accuracy over alternative models. As a secondary contribution, we develop a new logistic regression model, Recent-Performance Factors Analysis, that leverages this representation of recent performance, and has higher predictive accuracy than existing logistic regression models.

With this method, by comparing two or more output pictures produced by programming samples (a question), a student must decide which one of the programs producing them is more difficult to build with programming, or, if the difficulty is similar for all of them. This study reported also the results of a test to evaluate this method's validity performed with groups of students of diverse fields. Validity was verified by comparing the initial programming ability reported by programming professors of these groups with the test results; this confirmed that the PVCC method worked well to find programming abilities related with PUP. In this paper we propose an enhancement to the PVCC Method based on the preparation of New Questions where two or more samples displaying both input data and output pictures are shown. By adding input data to output pictures and focus strictly on the programming processes needed to obtain these pictures from the provided input data, we aim to broaden the range of discernible programming abilities related with PUP. The results of a test performed to verify the suitability of New Questions performed with professors of programming is also reported.	image;positive feedback;potentially unwanted program	Dick Martinez Calderon;Kin Man;Hidenari Kiyomitsu;Kazuhiro Ohtsuki;Yukinobu Miyamoto;Yi Sun;Masami Hirabayashi	2016	2016 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)	10.1109/FIE.2016.7757489	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;multimedia	Robotics	-81.13133722981613	-37.900901137281714	31229

We applied K-means clustering algorithm to determine the groups of users with the same learning styles and capabilities. The aforementioned algorithm groups them by taking as input, to initialize the process, several fundamental user characteristics. Our study exploits the fact that tutoring systems have a large number of users and we use a machine learning reasoning mechanism, which is based on recognized similarities between them. The overall goal of this data mining process is to extract information from the user data set and transform it into an understandable structure for further use. Future plans include deeper study on the relationship between the different Facebook characteristics and clarifying which characteristic has the strongest effect on the clustering procedure.	algorithm;cluster analysis;data mining;k-means clustering;machine learning;natural language processing;statistical classification	Christos Troussas;Maria Virvou;Jaime Caro;Kurt Junshean Espinosa	2013	2013 International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems (CITS)	10.1109/CITS.2013.6705722	text mining;computer science;data science;machine learning;data mining;data stream mining	ML	-77.93267562417779	-50.79501917411001	31235

The support structure has evolved with the technology, and now crosses several technology departments including Administrative Computing (AC), Telecommunications (Telecom), Instructional Technology Services (ITS), and Computing & Network Services (CNS).  CNS, home to the university Helpdesk, worked for a few years with two home-grown ticket tracking services, Helpdesk.drew.edu[1] and Beacon.drew.edu. These systems were not sufficient for escalating calls within and outside of the department. In February 2003, a committee was formed with representatives from all the technology departments at Drew University, and Enterprise Application Specialist Axel Larsson was charged with leading the search for the solution to the university's technology ticket tracking system.  Packages that were considered were Front Range's Heat, Blue Ocean's Track-It!, and Hornbill LTD's Supportworks Helpdesk Professional. Supportworks was selected for its ease of customization, shared mailbox features that would allow students to send e-mail from the department account, full-featured inventory tracking, knowledgebase, web-based self-service, and problem and resolution profiles. It also had the most attractive pricing for the number of licenses we needed.   This paper will describe the planning, selection, design, and implementation of Drew University's helpdesk solution.	bounce address;cns;computer;email;issue tracking system;knowledge base;supportworks;ubiquitous computing;web application	Betsy Black;E.

However, due to many perspectives, models, and activities developed in DL field, students need help in their exploration of DL topics. Learning support systems, particularly e-learning systems, can help students in their leanings. However, a well designed learning support system should 1) collect fragmented but related course materials, and organize them in an intuitive, meaningful, and effective way. 2) manage and present the materials in a dynamic and flexible manner because students have diverse backgrounds and learning preferences. 3) allow multiple ways to access materials from any place and at any time.

In this scenario, this article presents the design process of Three-Dimensional Virtual Environments (3D VEs), based on games, here considered as serious game, to assist in the learning of hospitalized children. The serious game is grounded in the Reference Model for conception of 3D Virtual Learning Environments (3D VLE) to assist hospitalized children [4] and counted on Participatory Design (PD) approaches. From the approaches of Contextual Inquiry (PD technique) with health professional, including the hospital class teacher, it was possible to identify the main needs and expectations related to the conception of a pedagogic, interactive and ludic tool that supports learning on children who stay long periods hospitalized. However, the serious game proposal can be extended to all the childish public interested in learning by means of serious games. In the next stage of PD process, we will apply the Mockups technique with the patient (children) using the prototype developed.		Eunice P. dos Santos Nunes;Alessandro R. Luz;Eduardo M.

However, both the marketplace and career paths are becoming increasingly dynamic, with employees more frequently moving between sectors and positions than was the case for previous generations. The concept of a “job for life” at a single organization is becoming less prevalent across sectors and cultures. In such a context, traditional approaches to career guidance, which often focused upon identifying a suitable occupation for adolescents at an early stage and establishing a route towards it, are being challenged with the need to communicate the value of transferrable skills and non-linear progression paths. This article explores the role digital games might play in allowing learners to develop these skills as part of a wider careers guidance programme. Through a case study of the “MeTycoon” serious game, the potential reach of such games is discussed, with 38,097 visits to the game’s website, and 408,247 views of embedded educational videos. An online survey of players (n=97) gives some insight into their opinions of the game’s impact and appeal, with positive comments regarding the design of the game and its emphasis on creating an enjoyable gaming experience whilst providing educational content.

However, instructors may be unfamiliar with how FOSS communities work and therefore may be reluctant to involve students in such communities. This workshop is a subset of material used in Red Hat's Professors' Open Source Summer Experience (http://communityleadershipteam.org/posse) workshop, now in its third year of successfully providing a ramp to FOSS projects for instructors. These instructors have demonstrated success in involving their students in FOSS communities where students have contributed code, interface design, and more. Intended audience: Computing educators at the college or high school level interested in involving students in open source software projects in any capacity (testing, coding, documentation, design, project management, observational shadowing of a large-scale project, etc). The workshop may also be of interest to pre-high school computing educators and members of the open source community. No experience with open source communities or contribution is necessary.	documentation;immersion (virtual reality);open-source hardware;open-source software;ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability	Mel Chua;Sebastian Dziallas;Heidi J.

0f552983994e74f0ea77669ada42b3579fd36f15	the plagiarism problem: are students entirely to blame?	electronic media;integrated approach;student engagement	Plagiarism is not a new phenomenon, but given the proliferation of easily accessible electronic resources in recent times, it has become so much easier for students to ‘cut and paste’ slabs of text. This can sometimes lead to assignments being submitted that are inadequately referenced or, worse still, assignments being submitted that are largely (or entirely) the work of someone else. This paper critiques the various strategies currently being employed to stamp out plagiarism. These include the use of the various proprietary and freeware packages available for the electronic detection of plagiarism, and honour codes that incorporate punitive systems to discredit plagiarists. The paper concludes by arguing for an integrated approach founded upon a commitment, at an institutional level, to assessment regimes that reward critical analysis rather than content regurgitation. Importantly, ‘authentic assessment’ that engages students is deemed far more likely to achieve the desired results. Electronic media, used effectively, can assist in this endeavour.	basic stamp;centralisation;code;declaration (computer programming);endeavour (supercomputer);hoc (programming language);link rot;stop online piracy act;the australian	Jeremy B.

The term “Net Generation” is used to describe these young people who have been using digital devices such as computers, cell phones and digital music players all their lives. Can we then assume that the Net Generation would welcome the use of technology in learning just because they are digital natives?

His­ tory of Science scholar Elizabeth Petrick shifted scholarly interests from computer science to history allowing for an interesting discus­ sion between computer technology and its impact on civil rights and disability rights. These nibs are, Petrick explains, “tactile feature(s) that help people with visual impair­ ments quickly place their fingers on the correct keys.” Throughout the book — Making Computers Accessible: Disability Rights & Digital Technology, she identifies the ori­ gins of assistive device “gems” like these. In this context, assistive de ­ vices include any component that is employed to make task completion easier. Further, Petrick provides his­ toric perspectives of how computer technology was developed in the United States allowing persons with disabilities (PwD) full participation in their own lives and in the society. This political action occurred as a direct result of disability activism by disability activists and parents of disabled people. Making Computers Accessible provides significantly more detail than just assistive technology trivia. Assistive technology (AT) refers to any piece of equipment, software, or product system that is used to maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of individuals with dis­ abilities. The graphic on the book’s cover depicts someone using toes to type on a computer keyboard. The typing toes elucidate the primary argument of the text — the connec­ tion between disability rights and digital technology. Petrick explores how digital technology has been adopted by unintended users. These users include persons for whom digital technology was not originally created nor anticipated and hence provisions were not built into the technology by developers. Never­ theless, these unintended users, persons with non­normative bod­ ies, appropriated the technology to enable their own participation within wider society. Petrick identifies how the personal computer (PC) and the values embedded therein held potential for an increased level of participation by disabled people pro­ moting their own wellbeing. Focus­ ing on the role of everyday users and PwD in particular, she argues that the existence of accessible PC and computer technology exists through PwDs’ struggle for disability/ civil rights. This struggle began in the face of almost non­existent and/ or ineffective legislative frameworks for protection of PwD and within the cultural philosophy of the medical model, espoused by the inventor Ray Kurzweil, that the non­normative body requires “fixing.” She argues that greater social interaction occurs when using the PC and accessible computer technology. Hence, further on, Petrick out­ lines in specific detail the strategic partnerships established between users, developers, large and small computer companies, and the vari­ ous alliances. Petrick follows the Brand family, based in the U.S. over several years, in particular, their daughter Shoshana living with cere­ bral palsy. While the case (Chapter 2) opens with Shoshana and find­ ing appropriate technology for her, the narrative evolves to the Brands being instrumental in communi­ cating to other parents and family members the need to think of their disabled children growing up to be independent disabled adults, using available and accessible computer technology. Petrick argues that the technology must exist and users be made aware of its existence (through existing social infrastruc­ ture) to render it useful. Addressing these basic concerns, the Brands formed the Disabled Children’s Computer Group (DCCG) with other like­minded families/parents and subsequently other alliances at the local and national levels. This author illustrates Shoshana Brand’s devel­ opment from limited fine motor skills to using different levels of com­ puter technology. She also inserts basic photographs and/or screen­ shots of switches, and showcases the movement from command­line DOS input to graphic user interface, user­friendly features that would be Computer Accessibility Rights	assistive technology;chasys draw ies;computer accessibility;computer keyboard;computer science;dos;digital electronics;embedded system;generic eclipse modeling system;graphical user interface;network switch;personal computer;sion's minimax theorem;touch typing	Sylette Henry-Buckmire	2017	IEEE Technology and Society Magazine	10.1109/MTS.2017.2763439	engineering;public relations	HCI	-66.71153511938012	-25.97031024162209	31571

Two sets of questionnaires were used for understanding students’ approaches of learning and perceptions of online discussions. The online postings from seven weeks of discussions were coded into three major categories: Initiation, Elaborated Response (ER), and Response with Resources (RWR). The results showed, first, some aspects of students’ perceptions influenced the numbers of ERs and RWRs. Secondly, students’ contributions to Initiation messages and RWR significantly related to deep motivation and deep strategies; however, the numbers of these two types of messages were negatively correlated to surface strategies. Finally, cluster analysis revealed three distinct groups who scored significantly different in almost all aspects of approaches to learning and perceptions of online discussions. Students in the cluster who adopted deep approaches and scored highest in the perception scales outperformed students in the other two clusters, both in terms of the number of ER messages and academic performance. Pedagogical implications for teaching with online discussions are discussed in this study. 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this article, a group of researchers are asked to describe the functions that their blogs serve for them as researchers. The results show that their blogging is motivated by the possibility to share knowledge, that the blog aids creativity, and that it provides a feeling of being connected in their work as researchers. The blog serves in particular as a creative catalyst in the work of researchers, where writing forms a large part, which is not as prominent as a motivation in other professional blogs. In addition, the analysis brings out the blogsu0027 combination of functions and the possibility it offers to reach multiple audiences as a motivating factor that makes the blog different from other kinds of communication in scholarly contexts.	blog	Sara Kjellberg	2010	First Monday		public relations;social media;computer science;multimedia;world wide web	NLP	-66.4153407418327	-31.014614531263526	31788

2ab49965a7a3762ca006b16e4050f913cceee399	profiling student behavior in a blended course - closing the gap between blended teaching and blended learning		Blended learning is often associated with student-oriented learning in which students have varying degrees of control over their learning process. However, the current notion of blended learning is often a teacheroriented approach in which the teacher identifies the used learning technologies and thereby offers students a blended teaching course instead of a blended learning course (George-Walker & Keeffe, 2010). A more student-oriented approach is needed within educational design of blended learning courses since previous research shows that students show a large variation in the way they use the different digital learning resources to support their learning. There is little insight into why students show distinct patterns in their use of these learning resources and what the consequences of these (un)conscious differences are in relation to student performance. The current study explores different usage patterns of learning resources by students in a blended course. It tries to establish causes for these differences by using dispositional data and determines the effect of different usage patterns on student performance.	amiga walker;closing (morphology);learner-generated context;reinforcement learning	Nynke Bos;Saskia Brand-Gruwel	2016		10.5220/0005724300650072		HCI	-74.98802322235711	-43.98381328325001	31873

c675ac46c199a372c8bd2570a34b260ad630b84f	preparing our undergraduates to enter a cyber world		Today’s students have grown up with computer-based technology and need to be prepared to enter a career in a digital world. This includes an understanding of the broader implications of technology such as the growing threat of cyber-crime and cyber-terrorism, cyber-ethics, the legal and social implications of technology, and the local and global impacts. At our institution, we have taken a broad look at ways of integrating cyber awareness and education across the curriculum to reach all levels of students, irrespective of their major. We have identified core cyber issues that are taught to all freshmen, developed awareness training that is regularly completed, provided opportunities for interested students to gain more cyber knowledge through a student club and summer program, and developed an in-depth educational program for technical students to graduate with an emphasis in cyber-warfare. This paper will describe our various cyber programs and future plans.	cybercrime;cyberterrorism;cyberwarfare	Dino Schweitzer;David Gibson;David Bibighaus;Jeff Boleng	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-39377-8_13	humanities;psychology;political science	HCI	-75.97907889474753	-29.510186978510813	31986

Both classrooms were identified as Special Education classes by the Ontario Ministry of Education, and each student was identified as having exceptionalities requiring additional support and differentiation within the curriculum to support their success. Participants used MyVoice, a mobile application that is customizable through a website, which allows users to input vocabulary words and link words with pictures. The application can also be used to speak on behalf of users. Based on findings that technology perceived to be ‘fun’ by students has the potential to improve motivation in learning contexts, we aimed to (i) assess the degree to which the use of iOS devices and the MyVoice application affects attention and motivation levels for students with special needs, and (ii) identify factors that had the greatest influence on the integration of the technologies with existing curricula. Results indicated a strong potential for successfully integrating mobile technology within special needs classrooms, with a high-degree of student support for using mobile devices to enhance classroom experiences. The results also highlighted the challenges of incorporating these technologies into curriculum in terms of practicality, teacher comfort, and the limitations of the device. We find that the differentiation enabled by the multi-modal features of the application and device has positive outcomes on student perception of success, and that increased self-confidence in areas of the curriculum fostered a more robust sense of community among special needs students.

Online platforms that serve as automated practice and assessment systems have been offered as potential tools for supporting programming skills development, providing feedback, and motivating students. The present article discusses the use of an online automated practice and assessment system called Kattis for homework assignments and final project in three computer science courses. The goal of the present study was to ascertain students’ continuance intentions to use Kattis. We attempt to address this by using partial least squares on data from a survey of 50 students. The findings of the present study suggest that continuance intentions to use Kattis is driven by students’ level of satisfaction with the system, the degree of students’ confirmation of expectations, and the perceived usefulness of the system.	computational thinking;computer science;partial least squares regression;problem solving	Ram B.

3c2bf9bc59758c8b179d080a806a7f8e7ffaccac	fostering linguistic habits of mind: engaging teachers' knowledge and attitudes toward african american vernacular english	african american	This article outlines one linguistically based approach – contrastive analysis and code-switching – for teachers of students who speak African American Vernacular English (AAVE). I discuss obstacles to bringing these linguistic insights and strategies to teachers in training and in the classroom. Across four scenarios from a teacher education program and from middle school classrooms, I describe (i) a grammatical construction or a linguistic insight covered in classes or professional development sessions with pre-service and in-service teachers and (ii) teachers’ work products (e.g. code-switching charts) implementing their new knowledge. Analyzing the mismatch between (i) and (ii), I unpack teachers’ knowledge and ways of thinking about grammar, AAVE and Standard American English (SAE). This analysis reveals that teachers’ dominant language ideology and prior lack of training in the structure of English stand as limiting factors in the classroom, constraining their ability to implement a linguistically informed approach to stigmatized dialects, and constraining the linguist’s ability to communicate core linguistic principles. Finally, I show how this analysis led to adapting the core graphic organizer, the code-switching chart, and to increasing the specificity of grammatical explanations to help teachers take steps toward building a linguistically informed language arts classroom. Joni (2nd grade teacher): Melinda, do you have a minute? I wanted to ask you about Tamisha – she can’t read and she can’t write. She’s nowhere near second grade level. What happened last year? Melinda (1st grade teacher): Tamisha? Why, you can’t do anything with that child. Haven’t you heard how she talks? Joni: Well, what did you do with her last year? Melinda: Oh, I put her in the corner with a coloring book. Joni: All year? Melinda: Yes. All year. This story is not fiction. Because Tamisha, an elementary student in an urban school in Tidewater Virginia, spoke African American Vernacular English (AAVE) (also known recently as African American English, Ebonics, Black English, Black Communications, or African American Language), her teacher believed her uneducable and treated her as such. While surely an extreme example, Tamisha’s story suggests the dire consequences of dominant language ideology, the ‘ingrained, unquestioned beliefs about the way the world is, the way it should be, and the way it has to be with respect to language’ (Rickford and Wolfram 2009: 14). Dominant language ideology in the US ‘assume[s] that Standard [American] English [(SAE)] is the only legitimate dialect of English and view[s] other dialects such as African American English as incorrect’ (Godley et al. 2007: 104; see Language and Linguistics Compass 4/10 (2010): 954–971, 10.1111/j.1749-818x.2010.00243.x a 2010 The Author Language and Linguistics Compass a 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd also Gal 1998; Schieffelin et al. 1998; Milroy 2001; Alim 2005). In consequence, students suffer. ‘In educational assessment and placement,’ students who speak a non-mainstream dialect suffer ‘misdiagnosis and misclassification’ (Rickford and Wolfram 2009: 26; see also Delpit 1995; Rickford and Rickford 2007, 2010; Adger et al. 2007). Such misassessment is immediately apparent as teachers grade school essays written by AAVE-speaking students. The Landscape of the Classroom: Traditional Responses to Vernacular Grammar in Student Writing Students speak in the cadences, rhythms and patterns of their home dialect or their first language, and as they speak, so they often write. In particular, for students who come to school speaking AAVE, vernacular patterns often transfer into their school writing, as the below-mentioned samples illustrate: In Moon Cycle (see Figure 1), a 3rd grade student has followed the AAVE patterns for subject–verb agreement among regular verbs (Waning mean; Waxing mean; The eath spin; It take 365 day...) and for plurality (24 hour; 365 day). It is indeterminate whether the title shows AAVE plurality (Moon cycle vs. Moon cycles) or the AAVE patterns of unmarked determiner, possessive and plurality (Moon cycle vs. The Moon’s cycles). Figure 2 illustrates vernacular features from a sample of middle school writing. In this 8th grade essay for Virginia’s year-end statewide test, over half a dozen grammar patterns from AAVE transfer into the student’s writing: multiple negation (without no television), copula absence (Since there no television), plurality shown by context (you can do educational thing), possession shown by adjacency (Toni takes Joni ex boyfriend; Joni birthday party; Mrs. Parker permission), subject–verb agreement (Toni ... bring him), expletive it (It’s a sound they make...) and unmarked determiner (Last episode is The Parkers). In response, teachers correct what they perceive as errors in student grammar. Figure 3 illustrates many of the same AAVE features found in the 8th grade essay in Figure 2: subject–verb agreement (The wood make a crackling sound), expletive it and unmarked determiner (it is big bedroom), plus a few additional transfers of vernacular features. From top to bottom, the teacher assesses vernacular features as student error inside SAE, and she corrects accordingly: In response to It is big bedroom (line two), the teacher circles is and writes in ‘has a.’ Similarly, for it is a fireplace (paragraph two, line two), the Fig 1.

Fostering Linguistic Habits of Mind 955 a 2010 The Author Language and Linguistics Compass 4/10 (2010): 954–971, 10.1111/j.1749-818x.2010.00243.x Language and Linguistics Compass a 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd teacher again circles is, and writes in ‘has’: it has a fireplace. In response to vernacular subject–verb agreement the teacher writes: ‘-s on the verb make’ and ‘it has – not it have.’ Finally, finding that the student has omitted a word and misused another in It cool like the evening breezes (paragraph three, line four), the teacher inserts a verb ‘feels’, crosses out like and adds ‘with’ (It feels cool with the evening breezes). In each instance, the teacher perceives a vernacular feature as error inside SAE. At times, her correction retains original student meaning (e.g. The wood make vs. the wood makes; it have a porch vs. it has a porch). However, on several occasions, the teacher misunderstands the AAVE grammatical construction and changes the student’s intended meaning. The first teacher–student misunderstanding comes in line two with the expletive it construction. The AAVE construction it is is equivalent to the SAE there is ⁄ are. Thus, Fig 2. Eighth grade essay written by an African American Vernacular English speaker. 956 Rebecca Wheeler a 2010 The Author Language and Linguistics Compass 4/10 (2010): 954–971, 10.1111/j.1749-818x.2010.00243.x Language and Linguistics Compass a 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd to convey the idea of a big bedroom, AAVE uses It is (a) big bedroom, while SAE uses There is a big bedroom. However, unfamiliar with the SAE ⁄ AAVE equivalency between there is ⁄ are and it is, the teacher misassesses and hence miscorrects the student’s writing. The difference between the two constructions lies not in the verb, but in it vs. there. Not knowing the AAVE construction, the teacher assumes the subject is ‘right’ and the verb is ‘wrong.’ Accordingly, she crosses out the verb, replacing is with ‘has.’ The teacher does the same later, in paragraph two, line two, changing it is a fireplace to it has a fireplace. The true SAE equivalent would be There is a fireplace. Later in the paper (paragraph three), the student uses a different, if superficially similar construction in It have a porch. Again, the teacher corrects, changing have to ‘has.’ The teacher does not realize there are two distinct grammatical issues: expletive it vs. there and 3rd person singular subject–verb agreement (it have vs. it has). Finally, in the last line (It cool like the evening breezes), the student uses an AAVE structure commonly called ‘copula deletion’ (e.g. He a good boy dog; When you in school, you have to be nice; Everyone happy; It going to be a bad hurricane; She here, She here!). For a detailed statement of the syntactic constraints on copula deletion in AAVE, see Adger et al. 2007 and Pullum 1999. Believing the student has forgotten a verb, the teacher inserts ‘feel’, and changes the student’s meaning from a simile (like the evening breezes) to an instrumental (with the evening breezes). Why do these seemingly trivial details matter? What difference does it make as long as the teacher appropriately provides the anticipated, ‘correct’ SAE form? In teaching, we seek to build on students’ existing knowledge to add new knowledge. We design a classroom intervention to respond to the students’ level of performance, to Fig 3. Eighth grade essay corrected by a teacher. Fostering Linguistic Habits of Mind 957 a 2010 The Author Language and Linguistics Compass 4/10 (2010): 954–971, 10.1111/j.1749-818x.2010.00243.x Language and Linguistics Compass a 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd what they know and what they are struggling with. Thus, assessment and intervention are integrally entwined. However, when students come to school speaking a language or language variety with which the teacher is unfamiliar, the progression from assessment to intervention is disrupted. Dominant language ideology blinds the teacher. No longer does the teacher accurately assess the students’ existing knowledge. Where students are following a pattern in their home dialect, the teacher sees error. Based on misassessment, the teacher cannot anchor pedagogy in what students know; the teacher cannot help but engage in an ill-directed intervention. We might even say that a traditional prescriptive approach to vernacular varieties in the classroom leads to grammar blindness.

One of the possible ways how to achieve this is to use innovative educational mechanics, such as gamification. Gamification provides an opportunity to extend regular learning management systems and virtual learning environments with game-like elements, such as points, levels, and meaningful narrative. This paper describes the implementation and usage of gamified assignments in Web Development. Firstly, we analyzed gamification possibilities in higher educational institutions. After each assignment, we gathered feedback from students to study their involvement, motivation, and influence of gamification on how the information was perceived. Based on the results, several suggestions for the improvement are discussed, such as adaptive variable difficulty or making the achievements public in order to increase social motivational drive influence.	gamification;web development	Olena Pastushenko;Tomás Hruska;Jaroslav Zendulka	2018		10.1145/3284179.3284310		HCI	-73.96757099517151	-39.739852511475895	32465

This paper reports a study on informationseeking behaviour of prospective geography teachers at the National University of Lesotho based on their experiences during teaching practice. It is part of a larger doctoral study on information needs and information-seeking patterns of secondary level geography teachers in Lesotho. Method. The study used a questionnaire survey of the prospective geography teachers, which yielded a 74.2% (46/62) response rate. Analysis. Data were analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences to provide descriptive statistics. Results. It was found that the scope of the information needed by prospective geography teachers covers content that has to be delivered in class, teaching methods, educational policies and learners’ assessment. Various styles of information-seeking such as collaborative and serendipitous were used. The teachers experienced a lack of information sources at schools. They preferred traditional information sources such as books, personal knowledge and other teachers in host schools. Modern electronic sources such as the internet were hardly used, probably due to unavailability and teachers’ limited information literacy skills. Conclusion. Realising the value of information in learning and teaching, more needs to be done to improve availability of information resources and teachers’ information literacy skills in least developed countries such as Lesotho.	book;experience;information literacy;information needs;information seeking;information source;internet;list of statistical packages;prospective search;recommender system;teaching method;unavailability	Constance Bitso;Ina Fourie	2014	Inf.

Peculiar objectives of ICT use in this topic are to facilitate collaboration and to increase learning through sharing and distributing knowledge. This study aimed to investigate the effects that a small group has on the individual and collaborative learning. A virtual environment was used to study the dynamics of social behaviors in collaborative and non-collaborative experimental conditions. Our results seem to support the hypothesis that social scripts are started, even when people are in non-interactive situations, and this is shown in virtual environments, too. Such outcomes, and the virtual interactions content analysis may suggest useful advices about collective reasoning and e-learning dynamics, which are very relevant topics in the study of web communities and educational communities.

It would appear that the profession is on the cusp of changing its attitudes and procedures with regard to new publishing opportunities and the consequent possibilities of reaching new audiences, but it is not there yet. It would also appear that museum educators are unable to pressure effectively for the change.	consortium;serial digital video out	Philip Yenawine	1993			politics;political science;multimedia;publishing;public relations;museum education;knowledge management	HCI	-75.23863518883357	-27.245034527754903	32796

We had 13 students aged between 16 and 19 that participated in the study using an Oculus Rift virtual reality headset. These students were subject to an experimental environment that simulates a beach sunset. They had to perform breathing exercises and concentrate their attention on their breathing, the rhythm of the waves and on flowers of different colors that were appearing in the environment.

SQA services are rich in micro-collaborations which are referred to as brief, informal episodes of collaborative information seeking. Micro-collaborations have gathered interest in the educational domain because of new ways of engaging students in collaborative information seeking. Previous studies in the field of computer supported collaborative learning are based on various theoretical and methodological approaches that examined different units of analysis. Yet, amid on-going research efforts, there still persist a lack of an overarching understanding on how micro-collaborations enhance collaborative learning in SQA services. Hence, this study aims to understand the distribution of knowledge, cognitive process and social dimension that learners demonstrate in micro-collaborations in a SQA service. Data was collected from Piazza, a SQA service used for teaching Java programming for bachelor students and analyzed using the integrated framework. Findings suggest that micro-collaborations in SQA services promote all the three dimensions including knowledge, cognitive process and social dimensions. The findings reveal that social dimension in micro-collaborations promote collaborative learning by enhancing community building, developing self-identity, and improving relational dynamics, which in turn support learning in various knowledge levels and improve the cognitive process in learning. This study serves as a foundation for researchers to study social dimension along with knowledge and cognitive process, to understand the dynamics of micro-collaborations involved in collaborative learning. As for practitioners, they can look into creating environments for collaborative learning rich in micro-collaborations in both physical as well as digital space.	cognition;question answering	Mohan John Blooma;Jayan Chirayath Kurian;Alton Yeow-Kuan Chua;Dion Hoe-Lian Goh;Nguyen Huong Lien	2013	Computers & Education	10.1016/j.compedu.2013.07.006	psychology;collaborative learning;social learning;social science;cognition;knowledge management;management science;social constructivism;communication;social psychology;world wide web;pedagogy	NLP	-72.94511045328902	-41.200123197069836	32845

The purpose of this study is to examine preservice teachers’ attitudes towards computers. This study extends the technology acceptance model (TAM) framework, with subjective norm and facilitating conditions acting as external variables. Results shows that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and subjective norm were significant determinants of pre-service computer attitudes. Facilitating conditions did not influence computer attitude directly but through perceived ease of use. These findings demonstrate that social norm and facilitating conditions are potential variables that may be used to extend the TAM for research on computer attitudes.	computer;experience;ibm tivoli access manager;norm (social);usability	Timothy Teo;Chwee Beng Lee;Ching Sing Chai	2008	J.

4a172260e150eee5097aecb8c5ebf388d3238a2b	review of affective computing in education/learning: trends and challenges	computer uses in education;educational research;literature reviews;classification;learning processes;psychological patterns;educational trends;learning motivation;measures individuals;feasibility studies;affective behavior	Affect can significantly influence education/learning. Thus, understanding a learner’s affect throughout the learning process is crucial for understanding motivation. In conventional education/learning research, learner motivation can be known through postevent self-reported questionnaires. With the advance of affective computing technology, researchers are able to objectively identify and measure a learner’s affective status during the entire learning process in a real-time manner, and then they are able to understand the interrelationship between emotion, motivation and learning performance. There are over 100 papers in the ScienceDirect database with the keywords “affective computing in education” or “affective computing in learning,” which reveals that this emerging technology has been applied to education/learning. This study intends to categorize and summarize those measurements so as to realize their applicability, feasibility and trends. Finally, some challenges and suggestions are then raised for helping educational researchers when applying affective computing technology. Introduction Affective computing (AC) is currently one of the most dramatic growth research topics (Tao & Tan, 2005). AC is “computing that relates to, arises from, or deliberately influences emotion or other affective phenomena” (Picard, 1997b). In Picard’s landmark book, “Affective Computing” (Picard, 1997b), three types of AC applications have been identified: (1) systems that detect the emotions of the user, (2) systems that express what a human would perceive as an emotion (eg, an avatar), and (3) systems that actually “feel an emotion.” Since then, there has been much interest among computer scientists and engineers looking for ways to improve human–computer interfaces by coordinating emotion and cognition with task constraints and demands (Calvo & D’Mello, 2010). AC creates the possibility of developing recognition computational systems for human affective states (eg, moods and emotions), and narrows the communication channel between the highly emotional human and the emotionally challenged computer (Calvo & D’Mello, 2010). Therefore, AC research is a multidisciplinary area that aims to explore human affective experience with technology via combining engineering and computer technology with various research domains, such as psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience, sociology, education, psychophysiology, value-centered design and ethics (Picard, 1997b; Tao & Tan, 2005). The need for AC in learning/education Since AC was proposed by Picard in 1994, there has been a burst of research focused on creating technologies to monitor and appropriately respond to affective states (Picard, 1997a). Through British Journal of Educational Technology (2015) doi:10.1111/bjet.12324 © 2015 British Educational Research Association those technologies, computers are able to recognize human emotions in different ways. Why is linking human emotion with computers an important issue? The importance is indicated by the latest scientific research, which states that emotions play an essential role in decision making, perception and learning (Ben Ammar, Neji, Alimi & Gouardères, 2010). In recent studies, psychologists, educators and neurologists have shown how emotion influences cognitive activities (eg, learning) (Tian et al, 2014). The Cognitive-Affective Theory of Learning with Media (CATLM), an extension of Mayer’s Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML), has shown that affective features of a lesson can increase learner engagement (generative processing), which is helpful to a learner’s deeper learning (Leutner, 2014; Moreno, 2006). CTML supports the claim that cognitive processing and affective function influence a learner’s attitude and motivation when using multimedia learning material (Moreno, 2007). In Leutner’s study, cognitive processing and learning results can be influenced by factors such as “situational interest,” “positive emotions” or “confusion.” Meanwhile, motivation/emotion may occur in a specific learning situation influenced by individual differences (Leutner, 2014). For example, playing an educational game has proved beneficial in terms of affective and cognitive learning outcomes (Núñez Castellar, Van Looy, Szmalec & de Marez, 2014) and results in a high level of learner engagement (Clark et al, 2011). The engagement and learning outcomes can be also linked to self-efficacy. Self-efficacy, an individual’s judgment of capabilities prior to performing a specific task, and performance on that task, can be utilized for predicting motivational outcomes Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic • Affective computing (AC) has become important due to the fact that emotion plays an essential role in decision making, perception and learning. • Positive emotion leads to high comprehension performance. • Various computing techniques have been widely applied to the area of AC for educational e-learning systems. • Thanks to the development of physiological sensor technologies, AC techniques can observe learners’ emotional expressions and then provide emotional feedback to improve motivation, usability and interaction. What this paper adds • The trends of AC in education/learning are discussed. • Major distribution of research sample groups and learning domains are discovered. • Five challenges and problems for the implementation of AC in education/learning are proposed. • A research framework and a comprehensive multimodel based on an affective recognition system for conducting AC research are proposed. Implications for practice and/or policy • The trends of AC have become a rapid growth issue in the education field. • A multichannel physiological AC system can provide useful and detailed information toward measuring a learner’s emotion status. • Multiagent-based affective interaction systems can help with understanding emotional interactions from humans and computational reactions from computers; however, researchers should carefully avoid the ethical problem of manipulating a learner’s emotions. 2 British Journal of Educational Technology © 2015 British Educational Research Association (Schunk, 1991) and benefit the student’s engagement and learning outcome (Linnenbrink & Pintrich, 2003; Schunk, 2003; Walker, 2003). Positive emotional design (eg, warm colors and round face-like shapes) induces positive emotion and causes high comprehension performance and high transfer performance when using multimedia materials (Plass, Heidig, Hayward, Homer & Um, 2014) and web-based learning (Huang, Hwang & Chen, 2014). Therefore, some researchers have used artificial intelligence and soft computing techniques such as multiclass classifiers (eg, support vector machines [SVMs], RBF neural network and multilayer perception) to filter critical affective status information and developed affective recognition instruments for their educational systems (Tian et al, 2014; Wu, Tzeng, Kuo & Tzeng, 2014). Hence, the problem of insufficient affective interaction in education can be solved by AC techniques achieving four kinds of affective interactions: human–machine interaction, emotion category, emotion recognition method and emotion regulation (Tian et al, 2014). Owing to the rapid advance in wire/wireless physiological sensor networking technologies, AC has been applied to many disciplines (Wu, Tzeng & Huang, 2014; Wu, Tzeng, Kuo et al, 2014). Using them, various studies concerning AC in education/learning have been conducted (Lin, Wang, Chao & Chen, 2012; Wu, Tzeng & Huang, 2014; Wu, Tzeng, Kuo et al, 2014). Recent emotion recognition studies in education/learning have tried to detect human emotion using physiological signals obtained from a human–computer interaction system. In addition to physiological signals, other signifiers, such as facial expression information, speech and verbalization, have gained attention for enhancing and realizing the interaction between computer and human. For example, the affective tutoring system (ATS) combines emotional expressions and AC techniques and can observe a learner’s emotional expressions during the learning process. With this information, ATS can then respond appropriately to emotional feedback in order to improve motivation, usability and interaction (Lin et al, 2012).	affective computing;agent-based model;amiga walker;artificial intelligence;artificial neural network;avatar (computing);categorization;channel (communications);chao (sonic);cognition;cognitive science;color;computation;computer scientist;emotion recognition;entity–relationship model;high-level programming language;human–computer interaction;li-chen wang;machine perception;musicbrainz picard;norm (social);os-tan;radial basis function;real-time locating system;soft computing;support vector machine;unified model;usability;web application	Chih-Hung Wu;Yueh-Min Huang;Jan-Pan Hwang	2016	BJET	10.1111/bjet.12324	psychology;feasibility study;social science;applied psychology;educational research;biological classification;knowledge management;multimedia;sociology;pedagogy	AI	-69.50597057626229	-46.346407502949916	33198

We wanted to find out whether we could motivate them, using innovative classroom strategies. The study involved a mixed class of Year 4/5 children at a large primary school (390) in a suburban area of Bristol. It focused in particular on a group of six children (four boys and two girls) within the class who were 'dipping' below expected levels. The children were chosen purely on a dip in attainment levels, rather than aptitude or personality. (They were identified through school tracking data, based on their Key Stage 1 results and their Fisher Family Trust (FFT) projected targets). Our initial evidence suggested that inviting children to plan lessons by co-constructing learning intentions and activities in small groups: • made the children's contributions a genuine part of the planning process; • increased the children's motivation to learn, particularly for children who were dipping below expected levels; • made learning more relevant to the children; • ensured every child had the opportunity to become involved in the planning process; and • helped to increase the confidence and contributions of quieter members of the class.	fast fourier transform;aptitude	Paul O'Rorke;Timothy Cain;Andrew Ortony	1989			computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics	HCI	-76.88887487455477	-34.09838247024009	33208

The integration of Web-Based Instruction in higher-education settings will not be successful if these faculty concerns are not addressed. Four main stages of faculty concern (information, personal, management, and impact) were identified based on Hall’s concern-based adoption model. By reviewing the literature on the diffusion of on-line education, the author identified support factors that may decrease faculty concerns about adopting WBI. System dynamics was used to examine associations between faculty concerns and these support factors. Based on these associations, a simulation model was built using STELLA to test the potential impact of support factors on the adoption of WBI by faculty members. The simulation model will aid educators and administrators in evaluating the impacts of support factors on the adoption of WBI.	online and offline;stella;simulation;system dynamics	Hae-Deok Song;Wei-Tsong Wang;Chao-Yueh Liu	2011	Educational Technology & Society			HCI	-77.1109066669878	-35.864294195604394	33214

On the basis of the blended space theory proposed as a methodology for organizing the user space experience between the physical space and digital space regarding a problem called the reproduction of experience, an augmented space experience method for overcoming it was composed. It composes an active learning environment, including the meaning and connective logic by linking the story composition and delivery method of digital storytelling to the space experience framework of the blended space. In particular, the application to digital tourism was represented through Hwasung Castle case. The prototype of the system is implemented using Unreal Engine. Implications deduced from building the prototype for simulation are used in composing an experiment environment targeting users.

Do these types of applications reveal the learnersu0027 cognitive metamorphoses? Do formative and summative evaluations aim to admit knowledge acquisition at the understanding expense? Is the subject matter of the evaluation instruments and approaches a vital part of the learnersu0027 earlier knowledge? Is there any link between the particular knowledge base of the learner and this content? Does the evaluation instruments system bring access to the construction of knowledge? Is this structure adapted to the evaluation of low-level cognitive skills better than to the assessment of high-level cognitive skills? Does the context of assessment establish influencing variables that may affect the learnersu0027 results? Do the used instruments frequently grant determining the learnersu0027 weaknesses and strengths? Do the correction norms comply with all the learneru0027s answers estimated to enhance a special knowledge? Do objectivity necessities influence these characteristics more than the cognitive responses value? Actually, all of these questions reveal the importance and complexity of the evaluation problem in schools and also the learnersu0027 cognitive progress. They are completely connected to the content of the evaluation instruments and their form as well as their purposes and their backgrounds than to the correction criteria and norms. In this paper, we introduce a personalized evaluation environment for mobile learning. Firstly, we introduce an m-evaluation master plan. Then, we describe this personalization and the evaluation environment architecture consisting of Web services as well as based on communication between these services accomplished via Semantic web technologies. The environment presented authorizes evaluating the learnersu0027 knowledge of a particular teaching content by first of all searching, then selecting and finally generating a test perfectly suitable to their level of knowledge. Indeed, a new course will be proposed once the evaluation is achieved. We also handled an experimentation established to conclude the studentu0027s satisfaction degree.	expression (computer science);first-order logic;high- and low-level;knowledge acquisition;knowledge base;objectivity/db;personalization;semantic web;semantic web service;subject matter expert turing test;web service	Wiem Ben Khalifa;Dalila Souilem;Mahmoud Neji	2017	2017 IEEE/ACS 14th International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA)	10.1109/AICCSA.2017.68	architecture;knowledge management;computer science;real-time computing;formative assessment;knowledge base;summative assessment;knowledge-based systems;cognitive skill;knowledge acquisition;cognition	Web+IR	-79.3626074921327	-45.63846055304083	33395

The cutthroat nature of these classes comes from students attempting to get as high a grade as possible, which may or may not correlate with actual learning. Further, there is very little collaboration allowed in most introductory CS classes. Most assignments are completed individually since many educators feel that students learn the most, especially in introductory classes, by working alone. In addition to completing “normal” individual assignments, which have many benefits, we wanted to expose students to collaboration early (via, for example, team projects). In this paper, we describe how we leveraged competition and collaboration in a CS2 class to help students learn aspects of computer science better - in this case, good software design and software testing - and summarize student feedback.	computer science;software design;software engineering;software testing	Swapneel Sheth;Jonathan Bell;Gail E.

Therefore, many learners do the experiential learning through visual and haptic digital teaching materials. In such a system, however, it is difficult to evaluate whether the learner could recognize the sensation and obtain the sensory skill. In the paper, we investigate whether the biological signal such as EEG can be used for the evaluation of the haptic task skill level. © 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

5dce06611ad803333b844b850abdfc06ad316ee9	university lecturer views on pedagogic lurking		This paper reports on an investigation into perceptions of international university lecturers and their concerns about students' social and academic motivation for learning in online learning environments. The study results suggest that pedagogic lurking is a widespread phenomenon, with some perceiving it as problematic and others as a step towards more active participation. Most interestingly, there does seem to be a lack of appetite for learning analytics software that would allow the close monitoring of student learning engagement and progress. Implications of this study for online learning and teaching are discussed.	lurker;online machine learning	Eva Dobozy	2017	2017 IEEE 17th International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT)	10.1109/ICALT.2017.26	multimedia;knowledge management;information processing;software;experiential learning;computer science;learning analytics;pedagogy;phenomenon	Visualization	-74.73704666513088	-37.606313879582814	33753

422d8bf5d1d5fbf7d8c5350fe611d5c2b56e8d24	enhancing students learning skills through integrated course project design model (icpdm)		The perpetually changing technology and global market needs have necessitated imparting lifelong learning skills to students through technical education. For the undergraduate engineering students to become acceptable by industry, their critical thinking and problem solving ability, design and analysis capability, interpersonal and communication skills need to be honed. Through integrated curriculum, the students can pursue learning in a holistic way thus avoiding restrictions imposed by course boundaries and it helps develop positive attitudes for continued successful learning throughout their undergraduate study. An integrated curriculum fosters learning experiences that are designed to be mutually reinforcing and synthesized across traditional subject areas. This calls for certain curriculum reforms and here the authors have proposed integrated course project design model (ICPDM). This paper presents a model ICPDM for integrated course design, which is used for implementation of Integrated Course Project (ICP).	experience;holism;problem solving	M Vijayalakshmi;Mahesh S.

This paper argues that there is an obvious mobile component or addition to these and that this would a tactical improvement to the digital literacy agenda. A world characterised by near universal connection and movement does however pose a more serious and profound opportunity or challenge to this agenda, that of context as text and self as reader and writer. This paper reflects on a significant component of the socio-cultural context of mobile learning.

Dementia is not a specific disease. It's an overall term that describes a wide range of symptoms associated with a decline in memory or other thinking skills severe enough to reduce a person's ability to perform everyday activities. Caregivers mainly face the problems such as (a) psychological pressure in a daily basis, (b) lack of knowledge and/or training about caring the patients and (c) lack of knowledge about the consequences of dementia in patients' behavior. These issues reveal the demand both for the support and the training for caregivers. Following this direction, we developed a web based framework to provide distant support for caregivers who are not able to participate in face to face sessions. This framework integrates services (i.e. teleconferencing, content management, learning management) and tools (such as bio-feedback devices) to support distance learning and psychological support of the caregivers. Based on the current usage of this framework this paper investigates the exploitation and integration of scripted computer-supported collaborative learning activities in order to guide and enhance the caregivers' support.	british informatics olympiad;emoticon;interaction;usability;web application	Ippokratis Apostolidis;Anastasios Karakostas;Tatiana Dimitriou;Thrasyvoulos Tsiatsos;Magda Tsolaki	2014	2014 International Conference on Intelligent Networking and Collaborative Systems	10.1109/INCoS.2014.88	collaborative learning;knowledge management;management;collaboration	Robotics	-70.01833000329951	-44.23657927251763	34066

The goal is to understand the effect of the marketing strategies used by sports industry's brands in order to create more effective audiovisual sports advertising. This research explores the influence of sports audiovisual content in sedentary and athletic individuals, creating a bridge between sports advertising and body image. A bridge that many authors have identified to be missing. This research integrates a qualitative research strategy in a quasi-experimental approach, using mixed methods. Specifically, by applying an exploratory Online Research Survey on a heterogeneous population. And conducting a Focus Group Research with a sample of sedentary individuals from the Aveiro Municipality. The evaluation was accomplished through the screening of a sports video in the second session of the Focus Group Research in which, after a 10-minute workout, the participants' behaviors were assessed with the use of an Observation Grid and a post-workout discussion. These methods were progressively used in order to cross information and contribute in the design of the sequential investigation steps. We've come to the conclusions that there is a high chance that audiovisual sports advertising has a detrimental effect on both sedentary and athletic individuals. The main findings of this research identified that, although the Focus Group participants did not verbally confirm it, the video appeared to have a motivational effect on participants. They revealed a better performance and a more focused attitude during the test session. Sedentary individuals seem to be more critical of the female body than athletic individuals and, as opposed to individuals who consider themselves athletic, individuals who consider themselves sedentary will less likely feel especially motivated to exercise when watching inspirational fitness videos. In addition, gender does not seem to be correlated with sports advertising, sports apparel or gear seems to especially motivate athletic individuals to exercise and individuals' self-perception seems to be correlated to their workout motivations.	focus group;self-censorship	Jennifer Santos;Pedro Amado	2016	2016 1st International Conference on Technology and Innovation in Sports, Health and Wellbeing (TISHW)	10.1109/TISHW.2016.7847778	psychology;simulation;multimedia;advertising	HCI	-75.27036202813196	-42.00714975035323	34166

Community members repeatedly crossed between online and offline, visible and invisible, formal and informal, and reflective and active engagement spaces as they sought to meet diverse needs. As they did this, they had to continually recontextualise knowledge, adapting, varying and personalising it to fit the function, genre and conventions of each engagement space. This promoted the embedding of professional knowledge. The complex online environment in which they operated can be seen as providing a situation of enhanced polycontextuality, within which multiple boundary crossings facilitated strong personalisation. At the community level, knowledge convergence was fostered by the recurrence of dominant, powerful mnemonic themes.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Research limitations/implications#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#– An opportunity exists to investigate the applicability of these findings in other online professional contexts.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Originality/value#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#– The paper extends the concept of boundary crossing to crossings in a polycontextual online environment.

An intelligent learning environment has been implemented for tutoring declarative knowledge based problem solving. The environment is built around two levels of learner modelling: shallow modelling and deep modelling. The first relates an error of the learner with a misconception. The second verifies the learner’s acquisition of various factual knowledge or concepts needed, and helps the learner to solve a concrete problem. A learning environment for Accountancy which serves as a case study, has been implemented in Smalltalk V for OS2.	problem solving	Lianjing Huang;Pierre E.

In short it identifies usability problems with future interaction technologies and map these future interaction technologies to e-Services.

Usually the heterogeneity in the context of the users which request Web contents is not taken into account by the servers that deliver them implying that these contents will not always suit their needs. In the particular case of e-learning platforms this issue is especially critical due to the fact that it puts at stake the knowledge acquired by their users. In the following paper we present a system that aims to provide the dotLRN e-learning platform with the capability to adapt to its users context.

In educational research, a fundamental goal is identifying which skills students have mastered, which skills they have not, and which skills they are in the process of mastering. As the number of examinees, items, and skills increases, the estimation of even simple cognitive diagnosis models becomes difficult. To address this, we introduce a capability matrix showing for each skill the proportion correct on all items tried by each student involving that skill. We apply variations of common clustering methods to this matrix and discuss conditioning on sparse subspaces.

Six years ago Dagienė and Futschek determined the criteria for good contest tasks, which are frequently used by the International Bebras Committee for selecting and improving tasks for national contest organizers. New experience and findings from several surveys allow us to reconsider these criteria from a new viewpoint and to assess which of these criteria are still actual, which need revisions and whether some new criteria are needed if the process of creation of informatics tasks for the contest is to be improved. The paper discusses the issues of motivation, interactivity, multiple-choice answers and content topics. The reviewed criteria and categories might be useful for authors of Bebras tasks as well as for creators of informatics curricula.	community informatics	Jiří Vaníček	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-09958-3_3	computer science;data science;data mining;management science	NLP	-78.94297024889701	-28.490994014942338	34636

The success of school-enterprise cooperation and cooperative strategy is closely related to the training cost of the school or the enterprise. This paper proposes a student-, school- and enterprise-based three-party cooperative game model to rationally quantify relevant parameters such as the training cost of the school and enterprise. Simulation of the three-party cooperative game model is also studied in the paper. Results of simulation will help the school and enterprise develop corresponding strategies. The model can also give a reasonable explanation on realities of school-enterprise coalition.

It is become necessary to build additional tools to help learner in their learning. Nowadays few works consider the idea to integrate intelligent tutors for such environments in ever-changing evolution and social-constructivism approaches show the importance of interactions between actors (learners, tutors) in the learning process.#R##N##R##N#To answer these problems, this paper presents CAMELEON, a generic model of embodied conversational agent (ECA) devoted to e-learning portals. This agent is always in interactions with the learner in order to improve his learning task. The agent is only the visible part of an underground multi-agent system, in which several agents interact according to the user actions, the web site evolution and the pedagogical scenarios. All these interactions allow to filter all the available information in order to adapt the ECA behavior to learners.	dialog system;embodied agent;portals	Mélanie Courtine;Valérie Renault	2007			simulation;embodied agent;computer science;multimedia;adaptation	NLP	-80.10433520967959	-44.96344510807001	34657

Often accompanying such growth is a concern from faculty that the additional students choosing to pursue computing may not have the same aptitude for the subject as was seen in prior student populations. Thus such students may exhibit weaker performance in computing courses. To help address this question, we present a statistical analysis using mixture modeling of students' performance in an introductory programming class at Stanford University over an eight year period, during which enrollments in the course more than doubled. Importantly, in this setting many variables that would normally confound such a study are directly controlled for. We find that the distribution of student performance during this period, as reflected in their programming assignment scores, remains remarkably stable despite the large growth in enrollment. We then explain how the notion of having """"more weak students"""" and the fact that the distribution of student ability is unchanged can readily co-exist and lead to misperceptions about the quality of incoming students during an enrollment boom."""	computer science;mixture model;population;aptitude	Mehran Sahami;Chris Piech	2016		10.1145/2839509.2844621	simulation;computer science;pedagogy	ML	-85.79616447106064	-41.56598231993544	34666

It reports findings from a study of whether and how MOOC log file data can assist in understanding how MOOC participants use (often) messy, chaotic forums to support complex, unpredictable, contingent learning processes. It is argued that descriptions of posting, voting and viewing behaviours do not in and of themselves provide insights about how learning is generated in MOOC forums. Rather, it is hypothesised that there is a skill involved in using forums to learn; that theory-informed descriptions of this skill illustrate how MOOC participants use forums differently as they progress from novice to expert; that the skill progression can be validated through the use of forum log file data; and that log file data can also be used to assess an individual MOOC participant's position in relation to this progression -- that is, to measure an individual's skill in learning through forums and similar educational settings. These hypotheses were examined using data drawn from forums in a large MOOC run at the University of Melbourne in 2013.	color gradient;contingency (philosophy);massive open online course	Sandra Milligan	2015		10.1145/2723576.2723596	simulation;computer science;data science;multimedia	HCI	-74.95923570082138	-44.71021292270104	34668

In this paper, we introduce an interdisciplinary and collaborative research project that engages students in learning both science and technology by developing educational videos for science explanation. In this project, students from the Digital Media course are paired with students from the Introductory Physics I course. They work together to create videos with blended digital media, such as images, animations, audio, and videos, to explain physics concepts and phenomena. The strategies for successfully conducting such an interdisciplinary project are discussed in the paper. The assessment results demonstrate the effectiveness of this project in student learning regarding understanding physics concepts, understanding the importance of digital media, and using digital media technologies. Results also show that this interdisciplinary project enhances students' communication skills and help them to learn skills and knowledge in the other STEM field by working together.	digital media;image	Cuilan Wang;Qing Shao	2016	2016 IEEE 16th International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT)	10.1109/ICALT.2016.52	anime;simulation;media;computer science;digital media;multimedia;management;physics education;pedagogy;collaboration	HCI	-71.49313371387817	-41.37569738291826	34740

Electronic concept maps provide a promising representation for knowledge models that can be developed directly by the experts themselves, but the flexibilit y of concept mapping raises questions of how to support the knowledge modeling process and to standardize its results, in order to facilit ate future examination and reuse. We describe ongoing research on the use of case-based reasoning methods to support the knowledge modeling process through proactive retrieval of relevant prior concept maps, in order to provide suggestions to aid the concept map generation process. The selection of relevant concept maps relies on an algorithm that combines textual and topological analysis. We describe the algorithm and present an example that ill ustrates concept suggestion procedures in the Mars exploration domain.	algorithm;case-based reasoning;concept map;knowledge management;knowledge modeling;knowledge representation and reasoning	Alberto J.

To understand how students use e-learning platforms and what the implications are, we conducted an empirical study of the iCAN e-learning platform, which has been widely used in Fu-Jen Catholic University. We use the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), a multi-criteria evaluation approach, to compare five practices of the teaching platform. We designed a questionnaire to measure learners' perception of the e-learning platform based on the theory of knowledge transforming process in knowledge management. Accordingly, the model considers functioning and objectivity in terms of the following three dimensions of learning effectiveness: individual learning, group sharing and learning performance. Twelve criteria with twelve evaluation items were used to investigate the effectiveness of the five practices. We also evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of the functions based on the types of courses in the iCan platform. We expect that the empirical evaluation results will provide teachers with suggestions and guidelines for using the e-learning platform effectively to facilitate their teaching activities and promote students’ learning efficiency and satisfaction.	execution unit;expect;experience;knowledge management;objectivity/db	I-Chin Wu;Wen-Shan Chen	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-37285-8_9	systems engineering;knowledge management;environmental resource management;personal knowledge management	Web+IR	-75.7925470930886	-40.458217129932095	34809
6267f4834c057aa8c1a790fd5c0b50bb4461cb78	virtual biology exercise for the active learning of mendelian genetics and development of key competences		Over years of growing peas Gregor Mendel set the basis of modern genetics. When he was comparing different peas he used problem based activities and practical work. All these methods can be described as key activities for developing competences. With these activities students tend to gain more knowledge and the teachers do not have to worry that students would be under challenged. While it is hard to expect that teachers will turn classes into gardens to grow peas, the virtual experiments are far more reachable. The cooperation between Sinergise and Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics results in developing interactive virtual environment that will stimulate students to actively learn about science. With the exercise Mendelian Genetics students have to solve problems that they are introduced to and consequently at the same time learn new terms connected with Mendelian genetics. The virtual exercise was created to stimulate the development of various competences, important in natural sciences. In the paper we presented the virtual exercise, which was initially tested on 31 students in second grade of lower secondary school. Results show that students did not come across extraordinary difficulties while working on it. When working on the explanation of the problem, the exercise helped the students with less knowledge.	experiment;virtual reality	Miro Puhek;Andrej Sorgo	2011			applied mathematics;bioinformatics	HCI	-79.53284678107428	-35.94452744009332	34846

Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) aims at producing technological and media support to help elderly people to stay at their homes longer. There are many different projects on how to reach this goal, mostly with technological background. This paper tries to point out pedagogical and psychological positions in order to reflect innovations critically. This paper concentrates on creation, design, performance and effects of these innovations.  The discussion about Ambient Assisted Living started when political entities couldn't ignore the fact of the demographic change any longer. The European Union, for example, started a program called AAL to support projects that produce innovative devices for old people. One regional project is about the medium IPTV that should inform, train und support elderly so that they can manage their daily lives. Information and interaction are the main aspects, which will be considered for IPTV.  Facing this growing field of research there are many questions concerning the necessity and the problems of all projects. Some of them will be discussed here: (1) Which possibilities and barriers arise with technological and media inventions? (2) How does the target group, which consists of elderly people, influence design, performance and effects of technological innovations?  In order to get answers to these questions we will take a look at the situation of elderly people, of technology and media and the interplay between them.	atm adaptation layer;entity;iptv	Verena Fuchsberger	2008		10.1145/1461912.1461917	simulation;engineering;operations management;multimedia	HCI	-73.20395755639004	-30.803787770945828	35046

0b86eec66ace93cef0e70028547527e6953e8c9c	analyzing the learnability of childprogramming model, as a subcharacteristic of the usability		ChildProgramming is a process model which teaches software programming to children, and its goal is to get computational thinking skills. This model was proposed in the year 2012 and has been implemented in some educational institutions to the programming teaching which is getting significant results. In the investigation and consolidation have performed different case studies where the teachers have manifested some difficulties in the moment of interpret and apply the model in their classroom. However, ChildProgramming is not a software product, but a process, this paper propose to evaluate the learning capacity that offers the model to its end users, as one the subcharacteristics of the proposed usability in the norm ISO/IEC 25010. For this evaluation is defined some metrics related to familiarity, common language, consistency and intuition, which in this work are adapted to the evaluation of a software process with purpose of identify improvements in the structure and description of the ChildProgramming model.	learnability;usability	Ana María González;Julio Ariel Hurtado	2017		10.1145/3123818.3123861	human–computer interaction;software development process;learnability;management science;simulation;usability lab;component-based usability testing;computer science;software;usability;usability goals;computational thinking	AI	-65.70976059031905	-47.052679369982314	35218

They play different genres of games in different settings and on varying platforms. In recent years educators beginning to take interest in this phenomena and explore the characteristics of the computer games that allure children of all ages. Many have agreed that interactive computer games enhance concentration, promote critical thinking, increase motivation and encourage socialisation. This paper examines the core attributes of some of the interactive computer games and suggests how these attributes can be adapted in the lessons as edutainment that can captivate and delight the students in day-to-day teaching in the classrooms.	educational entertainment;pc game;programmer;relevance;situated cognition;social constructivism;socialization;swift (programming language);video game design	Myint Swe Khine;Mohamad Shalleh Bin Suja'ee	2008	Trans.

The curriculum was cooperatively developed by a group from industry and academe and has been reviewed by a large group of reviewers. The review led to some revisions. The curriculum is now available for dissemination at www.iscc.unomaha.edu. This project was funded by several NSF/DUE grants and has been partially implemented in at least two institutions. The implementations seem to be very successful and can be models for curricular reform in many institutions. The lessons learned in the development of the curriculum can be of help to others. This curriculum is specifically design to prepare graduates to work on very large, complex systems. There is a great deal of emphasis on students understanding of a systems view and that information is at the center of the system.	complex systems;doris (geodesy);david turner (computer scientist);enterprise information system;enterprise system;eric haines;ibm notes;information science;international solid-state circuits conference;navier–stokes equations;requirement;simulation;sumlock anita calculator;systems concepts;tom duff	Doris K.

One of the goals in educational game design is to create engaging and immersive learning experiences for delivering specified learning goals, outcomes and experiences. However, there is limited number of research done on game usability or quality of game user interface. Failure to design usable game interfaces can interfere with the larger goal of creating a compelling experience for users and can have a negative effect on the overall quality and success of a game. In this paper, we review usability problems identified by previous researchers and propose a history educational game design which includes pedagogical and game design component. Some snapshots of our game module are also presented. Finally we present a usability evaluation method for history educational game design. From our critical literature reviews, we also proposed six constructs which are interface, mechanics, gameplay, playability, feedback and immersion for usability evaluation.	experience;game engine;immersion (virtual reality);reinforcement learning;usability;user interface	Wong Seng Yue;Nor Azan Mat Zin	2009		10.1145/1655925.1656110	usability goals;game design;web usability;game development tool;simulation;level design;usability;human–computer interaction;documentation;computer science;operating system;game mechanics;game art design;usability engineering;game developer;multimedia;game design document;user interface;heuristic evaluation;usability lab;game testing	HCI	-65.4219517522922	-45.306006928754805	35287

This approach is strictly related to the assessment phase. Assessment in the context of education is the process of characterizing what a student knows. The reasons to perform evaluation are quite varied, ranging from a need to informally understand student learning progress in a course to a need to characterize student expertise in a subject. Finding an appropriate assessment tool is a central challenge in designing a tutoring approach. In this paper we propose a method based on the use of ontologies and their representation through a Bayesian networks. The aim of our approach is the generation of adapted questionnaires in order to test the student's knowledge of every domain's subject.

The technology offers a pedagogical strategy to assess the students (online) by describing an evaluating strategy of student's assessment. The proposed system is being developed to provide an interactive web based learning environment. Three different types of assessment techniques have been introduced in this paper; Diagnostic Assessment, Self-Assessment and Summative Assessment which help the students and the teachers to improve teaching and learning capabilities. UML has been used to describe the proposed system specification while the whole system is implemented using .NET Framework. e-Learning and e-Assessment System with its web based features presents an equal opportunity of education for both the students in the classroom and the distant students. This is a student-centric system and the student's progress depends upon his/her own learning efforts. The proposed assessment system presented in this paper is aimed at supporting students in their learning by providing them with instant feedback.	.net framework;unified modeling language	Shamaila Iram;Dhiya Al-Jumeily;Janet Lunn	2011	2011 Developments in E-systems Engineering	10.1109/DeSE.2011.111	educational technology;computer science;knowledge management;data science;teaching method;multimedia;formative assessment;synchronous learning	HCI	-80.40795121291576	-44.738125856477254	35485

Considering learning factors of locality, formality and time, as well as elements of designs for learning and technical development, we have chosen six dimensions of the MSL framework (Wong and Looi 2011) to support our work. Guided by the principles of co-design (Spikol et al. 2009) and design-based research (Design-Based Research Collective, 2003; Ejersbo et al. 2008), we collaborated with 4 teachers and 54 pupils, devoting an extensive amount of time to design, develop and enact the phases of our proposed mDS workflow supported by mobile and web technologies. Beyond the mobile application developed for mDS, we have developed and integrated web solutions that support the overall learning experience, and tools that allow teachers to orchestrate the activities. The mDS web serve as a platform for continued work over time, such as reflecting, remixing, and reusing the digital content generated during the activities. The web platform provides means for teachers to search, watch, group, and assess the pupils’ mDS outcomes, and therefore serves as the interconnecting glue between all the learning activities involved in the mDS workflow. This study reports on the activities conducted in four classrooms in the spring of 2015, working with the five phases of the mDS approach. The outcomes of our efforts reinforced the importance of an active involvement by teachers to adopt and incorporate innovative technology enhanced learning (TEL) activities and solutions into their everyday educational practices, but most importantly on the need for schools to acquire self-governance on how to make use of their learning technologies.	seamless3d	Susanna Nordmark;Marcelo Milrad	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-25684-9_19	simulation;human–computer interaction;engineering;multimedia	HCI	-70.91190682011737	-40.1253335904427	35495

EPS aims to prepare future engineers to think and act globally, by adopting project-based learning and teamwork methodologies, fostering the development of complementary skills and addressing sustainability and multiculturalism. In 2016, two EPS@ISEP teams embraced the challenge of building a robust, inexpensive, modular, comfortable and safe wooden / metallic dome using simple techniques and sustainable materials. This challenge is demanding - requires a multidisciplinary and user-centred design - as well as rewarding - contributes to satisfy the right to adequate, safe and affordable housing as stated in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The goal is to solve the problem in a modular and sustainable way, i.e., by using repetitive linear elements made of locally available materials. This approach aims to dramatically decrease the cost of production and shipping, simplify the construction process and address the needs of the dome users. Although geodesic cross-linked structures have been studied for some time, their design requires the involvement of all stakeholders as well as a team which understands and integrates the contributions from areas such as electronics, mechanics, civil, environmental or materials engineering. The project-based learning approach fosters, on the one hand, autonomy, responsibility and the ability to make sound technical-scientific choices and, on the other hand, develops teamwork, sustainable development and personal and cross-cultural communication skills, while promoting the emergence of innovative, creative and sometimes audacious solutions, typical of the youth.	audacious;autonomy;capstone (cryptography);emergence;user-centered design	Joppe Balbaert;Jaehyun Park;Ramon Marimon;Akos Serfozo;Marine Cazelles;Stancel Constantin Domenic;Arne Speckstadt;Klaudia Skonieczna;Gergely Rajnai;Jairo Pérez Daza;Bogdan Marius Barb;Abel J.

Findings show that the practitioners obtained considerable abilities in identifying usability problems as they managed to uncover 80.5% of these after 30 hours of training, which shows a high level of acceptance. Findings also reveal that the practitioners prioritized fixing 61% of the problems and we found that they successfully removed 64% in a new interface design. We conclude that this approach may pose a viable solution to overcome the barrier of developer mindset."""	high-level programming language;software development;usability testing	Anders Bruun;Jan Stage	2012		10.1145/2414536.2414545	usability goals;pluralistic walkthrough;think aloud protocol;web usability;cognitive walkthrough;simulation;usability;human–computer interaction;agile usability engineering;computer science;knowledge management;usability engineering;heuristic evaluation;usability inspection	HCI	-65.00543987859648	-45.988878917832515	35655

The diversi®cation into distance learning, community education and industrial training which higher education is currently exploring can also be enabled through the adoption of CBL and CBA, especially if they can be delivered over networks which reach into homes, oces and factories as well as educational institutions. Clyde Virtual University (CVU) is a test bed for exploring, developing and evaluating techniques for delivering learning materials, supporting collaborative learning and carrying out assessment over the Internet. CVU was conceived in the Summer of 1995. The Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC) provided funds under its ``Use of the MANs Initiative'' from Autumn 1995 to Summer 1996. This paper reports on CVU's ®rst year of operation. During the year an extensive educational Web site has been designed and implemented. This report details the enhancements that were made to a basic Web server to create an educational site. It discusses the problems and design issues encountered when creating educational Web-based material. It examines the subject areas where courseware titles have been converted for Web delivery. Finally it concludes with CVU's plans for the future now that it has been awarded a further 2 years funding from SHEFC. # 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The way user involvement actually progresses depends on how the users are situated in relation to the design process. Their influence may extend from the results of the design project to planning and managing the course of the design project. Sequential techniques developed for the rational problem solving or reflective process have a limited application in highly dynamic design processes. More precisely, in sequential design processes validation steers reflection into a single direction. For this reason, a methodological approach not based on the sequential (hypothetical-deductive) paradigm but on the dialectical inquiry (inductive paradigm) between designers and users is considered. The versatile and holistic nature of this co-reflective process makes it suitable for dynamic and unstructured design processes based on different streams of reflection.	holism;inductive reasoning;introspection;problem solving;programming paradigm;relevance;situated;software design	Oscar Tomico;Joep W.

While many papers have been written on this topic, this paper definitely benefits from a large project, and is a must read for current or future project managers in the area. The """" School+ Platform """" was funded by the 5th Framework Programme of the European Commission, and brought together four universities, five secondary schools, and one small or medium-sized enterprise (SME). Their goal was to """" combine educational innovation with today's technical realities """" by """" creating a culture of pedagogical and technological change within schools. """" This includes the design, development, and testing of a learning management system called """" School+ Microcosmos. """" During the third project year, the project was extended to another 15 secondary schools. Using this background, the authors draw conclusions about the socioeconomic success factors of ICT integration in education. The first part of the paper analyzes economic factors on different levels, such as hardware and software costs for schools, and the costs for Internet access for the educational institutions as well as for the families at home. The second part summarizes the key factors for success and failure. Along several main aspects, such as educational change, sustainability, and technological literacy, central indicators for evaluation are generalized, which help with obtaining a basic understanding of the sociological factors of ICT introduction in schools. If you are currently organizing a similar undertaking, you might find it helpful to read about their problems. I was involved in ICT integration projects in the past, and the paper reminded me of the tremendous number of small but important pitfalls that can make the implementation of the best ideas become a nightmare. As a result, I recommend this paper to anybody involved in future ICT-driven education projects.

3f1903c07d7960bcadf55e4b77e2cbf0f712120c	emerging web technologies in higher education: a case of incorporating blogs, podcasts and social bookmarks in a web programming course based on students' learning styles and technology preferences	higher education;technology preferences;learning styles;emerging web technologies;electronic publishing;research framework;educational technology;internet;cognitive style;computer mediated communication;action research	The adoption level of emerging web technologies is on the rise in academic settings. However, a major obstacle in the practice of web-based instruction is the limited understanding of learners’ characteristics and perceptions about technology use. Thus there is a need to understand the relationship between students’ learning styles and their preferences for instructional strategies, including the use of emerging web technologies. Since learning styles provide information about individual differences in learning preferences they can suggest how instruction can be best designed to support the learning preferences. In this paper, a research framework has been proposed to incorporate emerging web technologies into higher education based on students’ learning styles and technology preferences and a case study has been carried out to validate the proposed framework. An action research methodology has been adopted to carry out the study, which comprises of conducting a survey about students’ learning styles and technology preferences; incorporating a combination of emerging web technologies based on the survey findings; and analyzing key achievements and shortcomings of the study to redefine research objectives. The study provides support for the proposed framework by highlighting the significant relationships among students’ learning styles and technology preferences and their impact on academic performance.	blog;podcast;web application	Nauman Saeed;Yun Yang;Suku Sinnappan	2009	Educational Technology & Society			HCI	-74.45721178839452	-39.835631337923736	35746

The project ran during session 2006-07 involving the use of a series of tutor mediated self and peer assessed core tasks associated with five distinct learning milestones. These were associated with identifiable blocks of lectures delivered by different staff involved in the programme. The series of Core Tasks placed progressively increasing demands on students so helping them develop more sophisticated learning skills as the year progresses. The PLE is used as the medium for self/peer assessment processes and for tutor feedback and mediation.		Magnus M. B. Ross;Mary P.

ff8f5024a8d5e979b4b7484e4f53695d38dba5a0	remote experimentation supported by learning analytics and recommender systems		This paper proposes a process based on learning analytics and recommender systems targeted at making suggestions to students about their remote laboratories activities and providing insights to all stakeholders taking part in the learning process. To apply the process, a log with requests and responses of remote experiments from the VISIR project were analyzed. A request is the setup of the experiment including the assembled circuits and the configurations of the measuring equipment. In turn, a response is a message provided by the measurement server indicating measures or an error when it is not possible to execute the experiment. Along the two phases of analysis, the log was analyzed and summarized in order to provide insights about students' experiments. In addition, there is a recommendation service responsible for analyzing the requests thus returning, in case of error, precise information about the assembly of circuits or configurations. The evaluation of the process is consistent in what regards its ability to afford recommendations to the students as they carry out the experiments. Moreover, the summarized information intends to offer teachers means to better understand and develop strategies to scaffold students' learning.	experiment;recommender system;server (computing)	Alexandre L.

Augmented reality AR is a new potential area of research for education, covering issues such as tracking and calibration, and realistic rendering of virtual objects. The ability to augment the real world with virtual information has opened the possibility of using AR technology in areas such as education and training. In the domain of computer-aided learning CAL, researchers have long been looking into enhancing the effectiveness of the teaching and learning process by providing cues that could assist learners to better comprehend the materials presented. Although a number of works were done looking into the effectiveness of learning-aided cues, none has addressed this issue for AR-based learning solutions. This paper discusses the effects of using learning-aided cues in an AR environment for a multi-body mechanism. The results indicated positive acceptance by students as a new technology in their learning.	augmented reality	Manjit Singh Sidhu	2015	IJCAT	10.1504/IJCAT.2015.073587	anime;augmented reality;computer-mediated reality;educational technology;simulation;engineering education;human–computer interaction;computer science;artificial intelligence;virtual reality;multimedia	HCI	-69.74577425025353	-42.8267863055302	35931

It consists of the dynamics of learning behavior over a variety of graphs representing the relationships among the people and processes involved in learning. Recent innovations in online education, including open online courses at various scales, in flipped classroom instruction, and in professional and corporate training have presented interesting questions about SLN. Collecting, analyzing, and leveraging data about SLN lead to potential answers to these questions, with help from a convergence of modeling languages and design methods, such as social network theory, science of learning, and education information technology. This survey article overviews some of these topics, including prediction, recommendation, and personalization, in this emergent research area.	emergence;graph (discrete mathematics);modeling language;network theory;personalization;sybyl line notation;social learning network;social network;systems design	Christopher G.

However, security planning is a complex process to learn. The Small Business Security Workbook was developed as part of an NSF CCLI grant to enable students to help small businesses in planning for security. The Workbook leads students and small business management through the security planning process, via a top-down (or bottom-up) approach and step-by-step procedures. Students learn concepts in lecture, which are just-in-time reviewed in the Workbook. The students practice with a case study, and then do actual security planning with a community partner. The Workbook is rated highly by both community partners and students in improving security in cooperating organizations. This paper describes the experience that a student team had with the Workbook and their community partner, as well as summarizing the overall perspective of the class.	bottom-up parsing;ibm notes;top-down and bottom-up design	Todd Burri;Susan J.

The purpose of the current study was to test the differential impact of two forms of metacognitive prompts on knowledge acquisition and application during simulation-based training. Participants in the experimental conditions were prompted to construct sentences by connecting declarative words (Words Group) or conceptual phrases (Phrases Group) related to the training material from two columns. Performance was then compared across conditions during an assessment scenario that did not include prompting. Overall, results provide support for the effectiveness of metacognitive prompting generally, when compared to the Control Group that did not receive prompting. Further, some support was found for providing word-based prompts over more conceptual phrase-based prompts, suggesting that the phrases may have distracted or overloaded learners. Implications for further investigation into the effects of different types of metacognitive support are discussed. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, its main limitations are the need for qualified human resources and the high costs. On the other hand, Augmented Reality (AR) technology has been increasing and it has become more and more popular because of its specificities. However, most studies involving these technologies are focused on the treatment of people with motor disabilities. Thus, this paper presents a proposal of an AR framework with gamification to assist the learning process of children with intellectual disabilities in general. Finally, the study will present some ways on how teachers might work some concepts and cognitive skills on children with intellectual disabilities with the aid of the framework.	augmented reality;cognition;gamification;virtual reality	Rogerio Colpani;Murillo Rodrigo Petrucelli Homem	2015	2015 6th International Conference on Information, Intelligence, Systems and Applications (IISA)	10.1109/IISA.2015.7387964	simulation;human–computer interaction;engineering;multimedia	HCI	-68.65938849583941	-44.08896164305575	36439

We represent student motion patterns from fine-grained logs of hands and gaze data, and then map these observed motion patterns against levels of student performance to make inferences about how embodiment plays a role in the learning process. Results show five distinct motion sequences in students' embodied interactions, and these motion patterns are statistically associated with initial and post-tutorial levels of students' understanding of feedback loops. Analysis of student gaze also shows distinctive patterns as to how low- and high-performing students attended to information presented in the simulation. Using MMLA, we show how students' explanations of feedback loops look differently according to cluster membership, which provides evidence that embodiment interacts with conceptual understanding.	computer simulation;ecosystem;feedback;lotka–volterra equations;multimodal interaction;multimodal learning;prey	Alejandro Andrade	2017		10.1145/3027385.3027429	simulation;computer science;multimedia;communication	HCI	-70.34436498919175	-45.97653786118875	36473
96802a30776250be1b92b493fc6af6e1c2661731	refocusing the lens on engagement in moocs		Massive open online courses (MOOCs) continue to see increasing enrollment and adoption by universities, although they are still not fully understood and could perhaps be significantly improved. For example, little is known about the relationships between the ways in which students choose to use MOOCs (e.g., sampling lecture videos, discussing topics with fellow students) and their overall level of engagement with the course, although these relationships are likely key to effective course implementation. In this paper we propose a multilevel definition of student engagement with MOOCs and explore the connections between engagement and students' behaviors across five unique courses. We modeled engagement using ordinal penalized logistic regression with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and found several predictors of engagement that were consistent across courses. In particular, we found that discussion activities (e.g., viewing forum posts) were positively related to engagement, whereas other types of student behaviors (e.g., attempting quizzes) were consistently related to less engagement with the course. Finally, we discuss implications of unexpected findings that replicated across courses, future work to explore these implications, and relevance of our findings for MOOC course design.	lasso;least squares;logistic regression;massive open online course;ordinal data;relevance;sampling (signal processing)	R.

Yet the numbers in North America haven't budged: women continue to make up 18\% of CS majors. Current efforts and research focus on societal, cultural, and psychological reasons for this underrepresentation. I argue that the political dimension also needs to be considered both in terms of why women are underrepresented and how to change it. I have found that admissions policies have a profound effect on how many women study undergraduate CS. I've also observed that diversity is not being considered in mainstream CS department policymaking, and ``women's issues'' are expected to be solved by women's groups. And in the women's spaces, I've observed a focus on individual career advancement (``Lean In'') rather than a push for political, collective action.	cs games;computer science;women in computing	Elizabeth Ann Patitsas	2016		10.1145/2960310.2960343	psychology;public relations;social science;developmental psychology;computer science;sociology;management;social psychology;anthropology;pedagogy	AI	-84.84805141212964	-24.196157321133114	36496

These devices provide the convenience of supporting access to learning anytime, anywhere. Further, mobile learning provides opportunities to tailor the learning experience to dynamically changing contexts. Major challenges for constructing context-aware models to support this kind of learning include defining the contextual information and adapting to dynamic changes. Ontology-based context models exhibit features such as expressiveness, extensibility, ease of sharing and reuse, and logic reasoning support, and thus show promise in this area. In this paper, we propose COMET (Context Ontology for Mobile Education Technology) in order to provide a semantically rich model for mobile learning. More specifically, we have demonstrated an example application to show how we can retrieve contextual data from different participating entities within the ontology by using their semantic understanding.	anytime algorithm;entity;extensibility;mobile device	Sohaib Ahmed;David Parsons	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-21869-9_54	computer science;knowledge management;ontology;artificial intelligence;data mining;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-81.35604088360583	-45.86849947087322	36498

Four components of communication technologies were presented in this study: (1) Curriculum; (2) Information access; (3) Future employment; and, (4) Technological materials.#R##N#The task was to engage a panel of educational experts (often geographically scattered) in the process of forecasting, sharing their reactions to each other's forecasts, and moving those forecasts to a general consensus. Then such a consensus could provide a blueprint for others in the administration of public school districts.#R##N#Since the Delphi technique eliminates random sampling, panelists (experts) were selected from a solicited list of successful educational specialists throughout the United States.

This work develops a novel multimedia mobile classroom feedback system (MMCFS) that instantly displays students’ responses, such as class-related questions or answers to questions on a quiz, on the instructor’s computer. This system reinforces interaction between instructors and students and improves learning efficiency. Its features are as follows: 1) automatic attendance checking; 2) in-class real-time evaluation; 3) improved willingness of students to raise questions; 4) immediate grade enquiring; 5) cross-platform functionality; 6) a virtual mobile classroom; 7) data integrity; 8) low construction cost; 9) group learning; and 10) learning process recording. This system uses a client-server and three-tiered architecture models as its framework. When a class is in progress, the instructor only requires a notebook computer with a web browser, while students need a mobile phone or equivalent mobile devices with built-in Java Platform, Micro Edition (J2ME) and wireless support. A web server and the rear-end database can be located outside the classroom when network connections are available. Attendance checking, conducting quizzes, instant question inquiring, and grade inquiring are the four primary functions of the system. A questionnaire is applied to evaluate system’s interactivity, mobility, and functionality. The 105 subjects comprised two classes of undergraduate students. The questionnaire addresses interactivity, mobility, and functionality. Its purpose was to compare the proposed system and the interactive response system (IRS). Experimental results show that the proposed system has superior interactivity, mobility, and functionality.

In addition, we aimed to examine variations in driving behavior across age cohorts. Participants were divided by age (in years) into five groups: not yet old enough to drive (under age), 18 to 25; 26 to 35; 36 to 45, and 46 to 55. The DBQ was administered to a sample of 1126 drivers, 50.30% of whom were female. Results are contrary to previous studies: factor analysis showed three pure factors rather than the four factors previously identified. Results also indicate that Qatari drivers share in their approach to driving even though there is great cultural diversity as well as varied language skills and educational levels. Significantly fewer driving aberrations were reported by female participants compared to those who were male. Furthermore, young men (		A. Soliman;Wael K. M.

d2b7f114777fffafbd9c6993ce307ac314a5a805	prediction of academic achievement based on digital campus		Academic achievement of a student in college always has a far-reaching impact on his further development. With the rise of the ubiquitous sensing technology, students’ digital footprints in campus can be collected to gain insights into their daily behaviours and predict their academic achievements. In this paper, we propose a framework named AAPEDM (Academic Achievement Prediction via Educational Data Mining) to predict students’ academic achievements based on the influencing factors we have discovered. Multisource heterogeneous data including Wi-Fi detection records, usage of smartcards, usage of campus network, is aggregated firstly. Then, instead of the self-reported features or traditional academic assessments like test scores, we extract features reflecting students’ behavioural patterns. Specially, we define DOH (Degree of Hardworking) to improve the performance of the classifier. Finally, we analyze the features extracted and apply supervised learning methods to predict their academic achievements. Experiments are conducted on real-world data from 528 college students in one faculty, and the classification accuracy can be up to 88%.

We carried out an experiment using artificial and human learners at the same time. Artificial learners are used to solve the cold-start recommendation problem when no paper has been rated by the learners. Experimental results are encouraging, showing that using artificial learners achieves better performance in terms of learner subjective ratings; and more importantly, human learners are satisfied with the recommendations received.	recommender system	Tiffany Ya Tang;Gordon I.

The project was designed in response to community college faculty reporting need for practical methods to broaden participation in their programs and their feelings of isolation from like-minded faculty. The 12-session prototype has been piloted with eight community college faculty. The finalized PD will be available as free, standalone web-based modules. The course includes instruction on research-based practices for recruiting and retaining women and underrepresented minorities in computing. Evaluation mechanisms are developed to assess the impacts of the PD on faculty attitudes and teaching practices, and the effect of changed practices on introductory computing students' engagement and persistence. Here we report preliminary findings from interviews. The project outputs will include polished online content modules, validated student survey instruments, a classroom observation protocol, and student and faculty interview instruments.	persistence (computer science);prototype;web application;web content	Beth A.

To help students understand the relationship between disciplinary reasoning, genre, and audience, we constructed what we term a “reasoning diagram” - a map that coordinates the knowledge domains of disciplinary content, field-specific rhetorical patterns of argumentation and arrangement, and genre conventions. This reasoning diagram was at the heart of an online instructional module teaching students to write a journal article from laboratory research in Materials Science and Engineering. Assessment data of online and live instruction using the reasoning diagram shows that this method of visually mapping professional communication, combined with instruction on the rhetorical moves of a professional genre, can increase the students' ability to understand how to communicate complex disciplinary knowledge, substantially improve students' ability to make appropriate rhetorical choices, and can help students develop their composing processes and scholarly habits of mind.	diagram;reasoning system	Suzanne Lane;Andreas Karatsolis	2015	2015 IEEE International Professional Communication Conference (IPCC)	10.1109/IPCC.2015.7235797	human–computer interaction;computer science;engineering;knowledge management;linguistics;multimedia;film genre;world wide web	HCI	-81.72875194479943	-41.081461962121715	36974

Patients use the Internet to learn about their conditions and medications, and to discuss symptoms and concerns with other patients on chat forums. Physicians also browse these chat sites to understand concerns, symptoms, and beliefs of patients that might not be revealed to the physician due to fear. This paper presents a series of visualization themes applied to patient-generated data to allow for the exploration of these data. The themes we address are clustering, history, and sentiment. We describe the process used to extract and prepare the data for visualization and conclude with a discussion of the visualizations and their use for a specific health community.	browsing;cluster analysis;internet	Brant W.

This paper will detail the research-based methods and metrics which are being used to ensure that usability recommendations are data-driven and performance-based. By focusing on the types of usability metrics being captured during usability tests, we will attempt to illustrate how usability researchers can quantifiably measure the performance of a system, use these measurements to make meaningful changes, and subsequently illustrate the improvements in user effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction.	heuristic;page view;report;usability testing;web design	Robert W.

dffb0c5fd95e132456549a1a7a890af40a151a0f	i heard you the first time: debate in cacophonous surroundings		One often finds in debate involving agents strongly committed to their positions, that argument is promoted not through a rational measured exchange of views but rather through stridency and clamour as proponents try to shout down or otherwise suppress their opponents’ opinions. While the presence of moderators may go some way to alleviating the effects of such approaches one has the problems of moderators being ignored and the environment being of a nature that makes the appointment of such infeasible. In this article our concern is, in the first instance, to examine the extent to which an environment where argument is pursued through these means can be modelled. Within this model, we briefly review what techniques may be adopted by participants looking to present their own stance with minimal effort and maximal impact.		Paul E.

Another contribution is that the study evaluated the additional usefulness of social centrality measures in predicting course grade after the quantity of forum contributions has been accounted for. Results showed that, overall, 15% of course learners contributed to the forums and these learners had a significantly higher rate of successfully passing the course than non-contributors (64% vs 32% passing). Learners who made posts to both content-related and non-content threads had a higher passing rate than those who only contributed to one type or the other. Among learners who successfully passed the course, there were no differences in course grade when comparing discussion contributors and non-contributors overall; however those who contributed to content-related threads performed slightly better than those who did not (course grade of 87% vs 85%).

It is no surprise that many non-motivated adult learners abandon prematurely their e-learning experiences. This is attributed in a great extent to the poor design and usability of e-learning applications. This paper proposes a usability framework that addresses the user as a learner and extends the current e-learning usability practice by focusing on the affective dimension of learning, a frequently neglected issue in e-learning developments. Motivation to learn, a dominant affective factor related with learning effectiveness, has been similarly neglected. Usability and instructional design constructs as well as Kellerâ€™s ARCS Model are being employed within the framework proposed in this work upon which new usability evaluation methods can be based. This framework integrates web usability and instructional design parameters and proposes motivation to learn as a new type of usability dimension in designing and evaluating e-learning applications.	usability	Panagiotis Zaharias	2009	IJTHI	10.4018/jthi.2009062503	psychology;usability goals;pluralistic walkthrough;web usability;component-based usability testing;cognitive walkthrough;social science;interview;usability;comparative education;knowledge management;qualitative research;learning theory;usability engineering;instructional design;multimedia;sociology;management;social psychology;law;heuristic evaluation;world wide web;anthropology;cultural diversity;pedagogy	HCI	-75.75681947423352	-39.70721425611564	37182

We, however, present a computer-assisted therapy technique, which primarily aims to enhance communication by visually representing the client’s spoken words via the computer’s word processor. Through this technique therapists can facilitate communication with clients and increase the likelihood of clients engaging in a reality-based discussion or engaging in a more focused discussion. Clients can also use handouts from the sessions to reinforce therapy goals. This therapy technique seems well suited for persons with schizophrenia or behaviorally disordered adolescents who may have difficulties with auditory processing or in communicating through the verbal modality, which is often required in a typical verbal mediated therapy session. We believe that clinicians within the context of their clinical practice can readily adopt this method of computer-facilitated therapy. However, the technique needs to be validated through further field-testing and controlled studies. 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

A collaborative design methodology is proposed which includes: interviews, graphical models of the analysis process, verbal protocols, a task-theoretic analytic model, and two successive prototype systems. The issues involved in putting the methodology into practice are reported together with the results at each stage. The project was successful in producing a specification for a system with which potential users were very satisfied. An implementation of the system needs much testing ‘in the field’ before a conclusion can be reached on its general suitability for ethnography.	central processing unit;confidentiality;map;requirement;systems design	John Read Davies	1990	Interacting with Computers	10.1016/0953-5438(90)90013-8	computer science;knowledge management;qualitative research;management science	EDA	-62.9444573382403	-40.48607419270344	37213

In Study I, we created the Japanese student engagement scale. We then conducted surveys using this scale and, based on the resulting data, confirmed that the items in the scale functioned well and that the subscales of this scale had high internal consistencies and validity. In Study II, we conducted a randomized experiment whereby we operated the degree of perceived autonomy, and compared the degrees of student engagement and academic achievement between participants with high and low degrees of perceived autonomy. The results revealed that student engagement in the participants with low degrees of perceived autonomy was higher, which suggests that, unlike American university students, it was not advantageous for Japanese university students to have a perception of autonomy. From these results, it appears that culture may moderate the effect of perceived autonomy on student engagement and academic achievement.	autonomy;randomized algorithm	Naoya Todo;Yuan Sun;Shunya Inoue	2016	2016 5th IIAI International Congress on Advanced Applied Informatics (IIAI-AAI)	10.1109/IIAI-AAI.2016.140	applied psychology;political science;student engagement;social psychology;pedagogy	HCI	-75.94761344141865	-41.69356636643739	37240

Preliminary studies on explicitly teaching roles of variables to novice students have shown that roles are an excellent pedagogical tool for clarifying the structure and meaning of programs. This paper describes the results of an investigation designed to test the understandability and acceptability of the role concept and of the individual roles as seen by computer science educators. The investigation consisted of a short tutorial on roles, a brief training session on assigning roles to variables, a test evaluating the subjects' ability to assign roles, and a set of open questions concerning their opinions of roles. Roles were identified with 85 accuracy, and in typical uses of variables with 93 accuracy.	algorithm;computer science;pedagogical agent	Mordechai Ben-Ari;Jorma Sajaniemi	2004		10.1145/1007996.1008013	simulation;computer science;knowledge management	Logic	-80.82499436605535	-38.27895242247959	37274

However, the present scenario of digital library environments characterized by different types of resources acquired or subscribed from different vendors operating with different rules, and who would maintain some form of control over the collections shows that adherence to guidelines by itself won’t ensure inclusive digital library environments. The paper attempts to explore the matter taking the case of digital services run in selected libraries to identify trends that favor universal design and point challenges that need to be dealt with as part of further endeavors.	digital library	Wondwossen M.

We examine magnitude estimation by adult Americans when placing large numbers on a number line and when qualitatively evaluating descriptions of imaginary geopolitical scenarios. Prior theoretical conceptions predict a log-to-linear shift: People will either place numbers linearly or will place numbers according to a compressive logarithmic or power-shaped function (Barth & Paladino, ; Siegler & Opfer, ). While about half of people did estimate numbers linearly over this range, nearly all the remaining participants placed 1 million approximately halfway between 1 thousand and 1 billion, but placed numbers linearly across each half, as though they believed that the number words """"thousand, million, billion, trillion"""" constitute a uniformly spaced count list. Participants in this group also tended to be optimistic in evaluations of largely ineffective political strategies, relative to linear number-line placers. The results indicate that the surface structure of number words can heavily influence processes for dealing with numbers in this range, and it can amplify the possibility that analogous surface regularities are partially responsible for parallel phenomena in children. In addition, these results have direct implications for lawmakers and scientists hoping to communicate effectively with the public."""	conception;description;estimated;evaluation;external debt;geopolitical ontology;hope (emotion);imaginary time;technical debt	David Landy;Noah Silbert;Aleah Goldin	2013	Cognitive science	10.1111/cogs.12028	psychology;cognition;computer science;artificial intelligence;computation;mathematical model;mathematics;numerical cognition;bayesian statistics;reason;algorithm;cognitive science;statistics	HCI	-65.08904635068359	-26.616958932133745	37351

This paper reports the results of a study in which we investigated the effect of menu-based self-explanation (SE) prompts. Students were asked to self-explain concepts related to incomplete LOCs they have solved. The goals of the study were (1) to investigate whether students are learning with PyKinetic and (2) to determine the effect of SE prompts. The scores of participants have significantly improved from the pre-test to the post-test. There was also a significant difference on the post-test scores of participants from the experimental group compared to the control group. In future work, we aim to add other activities to PyKinetic, and introduce a student model and a pedagogical model for an adaptive version of PyKinetic.	python	Geela Venise Firmalo Fabic;Antonija Mitrovic;Kourosh Neshatian	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-61425-0_49	computer science;python (programming language);multimedia;source lines of code;tutor	SE	-73.10995425268922	-46.19870027690482	37374

The course is being developed in phases of re®nement on the basis of feedback received from teachers and students. We have found persistent dif®culties that students have in understanding fundamental concepts, which has led us to investigate their preconceptions of concurrency. This paper describes the results of this investigation. The work is anchored in constructivism, which stresses the importance of prior knowledge upon which new knowledge is built. The students were asked to solve concurrency problems, both prior to the course and after learning just the basics of the subject. Analysis of solutions reveals that students: (a) ®nd that solving a problem on the order of actions is more natural than the critical section problem, (b) are divided in their preference for centralized and decentralized solutions, (c) employ inappropriate heuristics, (d) invent computational models as they work, (e) attribute parallelism where it does not exist, (f) attribute intelligence to systems. Based on these ®ndings, we were able to modify the course to address these problems of prior knowledge.	centralized computing;cinema 4d;computational model;concurrency (computer science);concurrency control;critical section;emoticon;heuristic (computer science);parallel computing;social constructivism	Yifat Ben-David Kolikant	2001	Computer Science Education	10.1076/csed.11.3.221.3831	psychology;social science;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;mathematics;management;pedagogy	AI	-72.16692615033706	-42.0434521740528	37435

The goals of the project are to 1) introduce more active and student-centered activities to improve student engagement and mastery of core concepts, 2) increase students' confidence in their ability to apply what they learned in the course to solving real-world problems, 3) enable students to gain experience using engineering software as part of the learning process and in applications contexts. While use of process modeling software in materials processing and manufacturing courses is not entirely new, the project has students actively developing a model around a realistic process, rather than passive users running “canned” models and reviewing the output. This paper presents details of the project and discusses preliminary results regarding its impact on student learning and confidence related to application of the course concepts. Recommendations for improving and expanding this in-class project are presented, along with a description of the assessment methods used to measure the impact on students.		Joseph P.

The aim is to determine the scope and potential uses of augmented reality in the education of information professionals. In order to determine the scope and forms of potential use of AR technology in LIS education a two-step analysis was conducted. The first stage was the in-depth analysis of LIS training programs offered by academic centers in Poland, including 8 programs (4 bachelor degree and 4 master degree). In this way, more than 350 learning outcomes were analyzed and grouped according to the frequency of occurrence. During the second stage of the study a list of the most important learning outcomes was compared with a list of skill areas that AR technology helps to develop, in order to formulate conclusions according to the potential use of AR in LIS education. Summarizing the results of the study, it can be concluded that AR technology is a useful teaching tool which enables students to achieve improved learning outcomes in the practical skills needed by librarians, as well as the personal and social competencies relevant to labor market needs.	ar (unix);augmented reality;language technology;librarian;library and information science	Magdalena Wójcik	2015	Education and Information Technologies	10.1007/s10639-015-9399-z	computer simulation;qualitative comparative analysis;augmented reality;social science;simulation;computer science;pedagogy	HCI	-76.92860814670713	-41.40529455644769	37698

The word “optimization” is overplayed because of its mathematical sophistication; whereas, the words “good-enough”, “better”, and “quick-and-dirty” are all but ignored.

The new “learning by arguing” paradigm leads to new learning opportunities. However, due to the difficulties in modeling human cognition, there are few learning systems that can facilitate argumentation dialogues between systems and learners. Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) is an effective tool in modeling human cognition. This paper proposes an FCM based argumentation model. Based on this model we design an argumentative software agent to facilitate argumentative learning. Provided with the domain knowledge and argumentation capability, the agent is able to simulate a peer learner and automatically conduct argumentative dialogues with learners. The argumentative agent can be applied in general school education as well as special domains like diabetes education and eHealth decision support.	cognition;cognitive model;decision support system;deep learning;fuzzy cognitive map;intelligent agent;problem solving;programming paradigm;simulation;software agent	Xuehong Tao;Nicola Yelland;Yanchun Zhang	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems	10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2012.6251204	cognition;fuzzy cognitive map;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;machine learning;deep learning	AI	-80.53600352328927	-47.71289145526928	37790

The current study explores the relationships between contextualized intrinsic motivation, communication skills, collective efficacy, and satisfaction in an immersive, computer game context. Moreover, satisfaction was examined with both self- and team-referents to investigate whether self- and team-concepts are affected differently within an interdependent task. Collective efficacy was also assessed as a cross-level moderator on the relationships between individual-level inputs and outcomes. The results emphasize the importance of distinguishing between individual- and team-level referents. Team member satisfaction and group task satisfaction had different significant predictors, though there was some overlap. Results suggest individual's game motivation positively predicts group task satisfaction, but not individual satisfaction. Individuals' communication skills and collective efficacy both had positive direct effects on both individual and group task satisfaction. In terms of cross-level interactions, however, the only significant interaction was between communication skills and collective efficacy in predicting individual satisfaction.	interdependence	Sylvia Luu;Anupama Narayan	2017	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2017.08.025	social psychology;psychology;collective efficacy;moderation;immersion (virtual reality);knowledge management;team effectiveness;interdependence	HCI	-69.4648694174646	-47.128156850401474	37908

In both situations positive effects of manipulable graphics on problem solving performance were found. However, a detailed analysis of the interaction processes in the collaborative situation showed that, comparing both experimental conditions, static graphics led to a higher proportion of correct content-related statements and explanations of system relations. No differences were observed between both conditions on the participation structure within the learning dyads. The results suggest that for the effective use of graphics in computer-supported collaborative learning, structural support devices that encourage adequate processing and focus learners on the problem solving process seem to be necessary.	graphics;problem solving	Petra Reinhard;Friedrich W.

While technology support for reflection on the individual and collaborative level is promising, it remains challenging to embed these learning activities into the organization. To better understand and support reflection in the wor kplace, it is important to see the mutual dependencies between reflective learning activities and knowledge maturing. In this paper, we seek t o bridge the gap by presenting a conceptual model linking r eflection and knowledge maturing. Based on the model we put forward three propositions: In refle ctive learning, expertise moderates knowledge maturing, discrepancies between knowledge elements trig ger reflection, and the maturity of knowledge used in reflection influences the reflection process. We use findings from empirical studies in two care homes to support the propos itions. We address implications for the design of technology enhanced r eflection support by discussing a prot otype reflection tool for care homes .	capability maturity model;experience;reflection (computer programming);uniprot	Birgit R.

Fortytwo college students, professors, and e-learning experts in Taiwan were recruited to assess the usefulness of the OCW for learning and teaching on this website. Semi-structured, hour-long interviews were conducted. Fourteen factors – including nine strengths and five concerns – that influence the degree of effectiveness of the design and implementation of OCW were identified and discussed with reference to three major design aspects (technological, curricular, and pedagogical). The implications for better design and use of OCW as an open educational resource (OER) were discussed.

The collaboration between the two groups can be enhanced by a technique called collaborative concept maps, based on SMSs (short message service). This means that mobile technology is used not just as a mediator (of learning activity/collaboration) but as a trigger and platform that includes guidance and support for learning methods and the learning process. A formative evaluation indicates that it is possible to construct collaborative concept maps by mobile phones (using SMSs) and combine simultaneous classroom learning activity with mobile learning. In the conducted case study, the students in the forest sent their observations, represented as concept maps, as structured SMSs to the students in the classroom. Our experience shows that even light and easy techniques can make a difference in a learning setting, if they are carefully designed to fit the real users' context.	concept map;matchware mediator;mobile phone;the forest	Pasi Silander;Erkki Sutinen;Jorma Tarhio	2004	The 2nd IEEE International Workshop on Wireless and Mobile Technologies in Education, 2004.

This approach has the following advantage: reducing the training cost, schedule flexibility, ease of diffusion and the accessibility of the training by a larger audience. In this paper, we present an agents based generic architecture of a digital teaching environment. Specifically we are interested in distance learning using virtual laboratories on the web. The objective of these virtual laboratories is to train a group of learners in the domain of experimental sciences. We have opted for the agent oriented approach to design our environment. Our approach puts the learner's needs and difficulties as the main factor in the design process and the computer modeling of our system.	accessibility;computer simulation;experiment;multi-agent system;world wide web	Saad Harous;Djamila Mechta;Mahieddine Djoudi;Amel Douar	2006			database;data mining;computer science;multi-agent system;virtual laboratory	AI	-79.36985456380692	-43.8775468592301	38190

Students are enabled to develop competencies that are derived from professional practice. This allows us to use assessment strategies that are different from the practice in traditional educational settings. In the Virtual Company educational scenario the competence assessment procedure starts from the moment a student has a job interview. Students in a Virtual Company are considered starting professionals and are expected to perform as such in adopting an active role in the competency assessment procedures. In order to implement the Virtual Company educational scenario assessment strategy in the Cooper project centred collaborative working environment we developed an assessment module that is closely linked to the Virtual Company educational scenario. In this article, we report on the modelling of the assessment process and its integration into the Cooper collaboration environment.	collaborative working environment	Howard Spoelstra;Vlad Posea;Jan van Bruggen;Rob Koper	2007			engineering management;simulation;engineering;knowledge management	HCI	-77.62599118882764	-35.23831095444972	38203

In the software engineering practice course we are teaching, a problem that may deteriorate the learning quality is that, the students lack the opportunities of communication and discussion with the instructor both in class and out of class since they do not have many common time slots. Therefore, a web based answer hunting system is carefully designed and built to facilitate the communications between the students and instructor, and among the students. This system is designed based on the Q&A competition metaphor. The students are encouraged to participate in the competition to learn more knowledge, share more knowledge, and earn more participation marks.

These goals and attitudes can substantially affect students’ behavior within the tutor, and how much the student learns. One behavior that has been found to be associated with poorer learning is gaming the system, where a student attempts to complete problems and advance through an educational task by systematically taking advantage of properties and regularities in the system used to complete that task. It has been hypothesized that students game the system because of performance goals. In this paper, however, we find that the frequency of gaming the system does not correlate to a known measure of performance goals; instead, gaming is correlated to disliking computers and the tutor. Performance goals, by contrast, are shown to be associated with working slowly and avoiding errors, and are found to not be correlated to differences in learning outcomes.	computer;performance tuning	Ryan Shaun Joazeiro de Baker;Ido Roll;Albert T.

The examination of the development of the education model is made from the viewpoints of accessibility, increased role of technology and interaction. In earlier studies, the education model has been evaluated for example from the viewpoints of changes in the participation rate and learning results, and the results have been positive.

20c0c897c09028d84da9414b565faac009626be0	infrastructure for replication in learning analytics		There has been increasing concern about the lack of replicability in psychology ​[2] and, while fervent discussion continues within the field and with the broader public as to the severity of the problem and the correct solutions to it [9,18]​, there is little doubt that there will be an impact on methodological practices ​[11]​. In this position paper, we argue that many of the same concerns are applicable to the learning sciences as psychology, and that new methodologies and infrastructure have the potential to help mitigate these concerns, and help us to understand how broadly we can trust that published findings generalize. In particular, we focus on the opportunities afforded by the large-scale participation in massive open online courses, and argue that the data from MOOCs can enable meaningful large-scale replication and comparison if augmented with an appropriate sociotechnical infrastructure, which we describe in brief. Replication in Education Over the last few years, there has been increasing interest in which findings are broadly generalizable. One approach is to design very large-scale studies that incorporate diverse groups of students ​[8]​. By selecting an appropriate group of students, it may be possible to better understand which students a finding will generalize to ​[13]​. However, such studies are both highly expensive and may not be robust to minor variations in design -since the same treatment, implementational approach, and measures are typically used at all sites, their findings are narrow even as they are broad, reducing the degree to which we can conclude that findings generalize. One other risk to generalizability is when experimenter bias (whether intentional or not) influences how results are analyzed and interpreted. While the practice of removing outliers until reaching significance or running 30 tests and reporting one significant result (with no post-hoc control) are increasingly seen as problematic, the “file drawer effect” ​[10] where non-significant results are suppressed (often by journal editors rather than researchers) and the natural human tendency to focus on surprising and serendipitous results can lead to spurious results becoming published and widely cited. While the complete elimination of serendipity is undesirable (after all, without serendipity we would not have penicillin or use salicylic acid cosmetically), bias can be reduced in several ways. One approach for this is to encourage pre-registration of scientific hypotheses before a study is carried out. Infrastructure such as the Open Science Framework ​[19] aims to support this activity. This can be done in either a descriptive manner, where the researcher outlines study, methods, and hypotheses then conducts the study, or in a prescriptive manner, where the research must first submit the registration information to a body of peers before the study can be conducted. This latter form intends to have two effects: an increase in the number of experts involved in the replication in the design phase, and (important for the investigator) reviewed pre-registration often comes with a guarantee of publication regardless of whether the outcome discovers a positive, negative, or null result. Another path which has encouraged replicability is the greater sharing of data. In education, the Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center DataShop ​[6]​ , an online repository of student interaction data with educational software, has led to literally dozens of published papers by secondary researchers. This infrastructure, now being iterated upon with the LearnSphere project ​[14]​, provides a layer of access and control services to educational datasets, allowing researchers to share de-identified data and use common tools in their analyses. A Proposal for Discussion We argue that existing infrastructure is necessary but not sufficient to support replication in the learning sciences. In particular, some analyses, such as discourse analysis, may require access to sensitive information which may be difficult or impossible to fully de-identify. While limited data of this type has been shared broadly, it remains infeasible to share large amounts of this type of data widely. In addition, there remains considerable data which institutions consider proprietary and which therefore cannot be simply downloaded by outside researchers. While exemplary organizations such as Carnegie Learning and ASSISTments ​[5] share data widely through engines such as the PSLC DataShop, they cannot share all data (such as student identifiers), and many other organizations are unable to share data even to the level which these organizations do. One alternate approach is to create a ​cooperative dataset infrastructure​, where data is not available for download, but can be used in new analyses. Large-scale proprietary data, such as MOOC data or educational software data, could be made available on this platform. Unlike data from traditional randomized controlled trials, this data could be drawn from the regular use of online platforms such as Coursera and edX, as well as data from publishers that is not currently available on DataShop. Given the massive quantities of data held currently by institutions such as the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Michigan, along with other institutions such as the Universities of Edinburgh, Harvard, and Stanford, there are great potentials for conducting broad and replicable research, where we determine what findings hold in what courses and for which students. But we must unlock this data in a fashion that allows researchers to analyze it while protecting the goals of the data owners as well. As such, in an infrastructure like this one, the data would be retained solely by the institution (or perhaps by a trusted broker). Rather than downloading data, any researcher conducting an analysis would offer code or analyses (in a syntax such as R, or a production-system language). This code would then be applied to the data and the results would be made available both to the researcher and more broadly. This code would be required to be made available to the wider scientific community (perhaps under a delay or publication embargo, so that researchers were able to publish their findings first), so that any result obtained could be re-checked, verified, criticized, modified as appropriate, and re-used where applicable. Again, this platform would not be in competition with LearnSphere (and in fact is likely to be a natural outgrowth of a platform like LearnSphere), but would supplement it for organizations that cannot share their data in the same fashion as the contributors to the DataShop do. A more controversial approach might be the addition of a ​sociotechnical infrastructure ​(Edwards 2003) which augments the cooperative infrastructure with a social/legal contract binding those who participate. Participation might entitle researchers access to underlying datasets, metadata, methods, code, and results, but requires that they participate equally by providing more datasets, metadata, methods, code, and results. Unlike the cooperative dataset infrastructure, this sociotechnical infrastructure would be a cooperative, where datasets, metadata, methods, and results are actively iterated upon, augmented, and changed. Like many open source software projects, access to this cooperative imparts a duty on the accessor. Such a sociotechnical infrastructure would be most successful if it accommodates the different interests and techniques of different intellectual traditions in the broad and intellectually diverse learning sciences community. For instance, we might expect that learning theorists might be interested in the relationship between discussion forum content and educational frameworks, such as ​[7,16]​, while linguists might be interested in the relationship between discussion forum content and student success ​[4]​. Thus for the same set of data, one research project could provide human annotations through open or closed coding, while another could provide feature extraction based on natural language semantics. Not only can the two investigations then look at specific questions within the same dataset potentially providing insight into cross disciplinary findings, but future investigations by others can use the same constructs (human annotations or features) either for replication or comparison. Existing Examples One well-known candidate for evolving into such an infrastructure is the PSLC DataShop/LearnSphere. However, it may also be useful to advance other platforms which are more specifically focused on large-scale replication of research findings. Some elements of the ​cooperative dataset infrastructure ​may be found in MORF, the MOoc Replication Framework at the University of Pennsylvania, which is designed to replicate research results across MOOCs. In MORF, MOOC data can be ingested into a common research format. This format is similar to MoocDB ​[15]​, but tailored to the specific research goals of the platform. Researchers can then input a finding to check for, realized as an “if-then” production rule. The production rule is then tested against the MOOC data sets currently ingested within the framework. The wide number of published findings from MOOC data (for instance, ​[3,4,12,17] provide considerable grist for such a project. Despite being broadly interested in the same topic, each of these experiments is impossible to compare to others in that they differ in several ways: (a) Feature engineering approaches used, (b) Outcome of prediction, (c) Dataset characteristics, (d) Machine learning techniques used By contrast, in an engine such as MORF, each variant on the findings can be readily tested and compared within the same data sets. In a first “proof of concept” pilot study, 21 previously published findings from the MOOC literature were tested within the context of a single MOOC’s data set ​[1]​.

Though a number of prediction models have been developed, they either estimate a single model for all students based on their past course performance and interactions with learning management systems (LMS), or estimate student-specific models that do not take into account LMS interactions; thus, failing to exploit fine-grain information related to a student's engagement. In this work we present a class of collaborative multi-regression models that are personalized to each student and also take into account features related to student's past performance, engagement and course characteristics. These models use all historical information to estimate a small number of regression models shared by all students along with student-specific combination weights. This allows for information sharing and also generating personalized predictions. Our experimental evaluation on a large set of students, courses, and activities shows that these models are capable of improving the performance prediction accuracy by over 20%. In addition, we show that by analyzing the estimated models and the student-specific combination functions we can gain insights on the effectiveness of the educational material that is made available at the courses of different departments.	failure;interaction;performance prediction;personalization;population	Asmaa Elbadrawy;R.

The goal of this study is to report on our experiences using a mobile self-reporting tool called Qualiwall for the customer journey mapping of an experience-centric service. The results indicate that the Qualiwall tool is especially suitable for mapping the customer experiences because it enables the collection of rich, real-time and in-situ data; however, it also possesses certain disadvantages. To arrive at more general conclusions, future research will focus on piloting the Qualiwall tool in other service-related user research situations as well.

We are now at an exciting moment in that history with unprecedented collaboration between many groups— K–12 and postsecondary educational institutions, government, industry, professional, and non-profit organizations—all working together towards a common vision of expanded access and opportunity in computer science. The CS10K Initiative spearheaded by Jan Cuny at the National Science Foundation launched in 2010 with the goal of having 10,000 well-qualified teachers of computer science in 10,000 new high schools by 2015. Exploring Computer Science (ECS) and Computer Science Principles (CSP) are the two high school courses funded through CS10K that form the cornerstones of the initiative. Offerings of both courses are scaling up nationally, with the 10,000 goal now tantalizingly within reach. The June 2012 issue of ACM Inroads included a special section dedicated to CS10K and Computer Science Principles. In this issue and the next (Part 1 and Part 2) we provide an update on the overall initiative, with this issue focused primarily on Exploring Computer Science and early access to CS education, and the next installment (December 2015) focusing primarily on Computer Science Principles and access to introductory CS in high school and higher education. We now provide below a brief highlight of the Critical Perspectives article and five supporting contributions in this Part 1 of the special section.	computer science;early access	Quincy Brown;Amy Briggs	2015	Inroads	10.1145/2803178	library science;management science;engineering physics	Theory	-79.47757928245943	-31.42091173791932	38902

Mechatronics is a complex, highly technical and multidisciplinary field involving the design and manufacture of integrated products. Mechatronics course at the undergraduate level is rapidly increasing across the world. Most courses require student teams to design a product. The complexity of student projects can make administration of mechatronics courses extremely difficult. Students develop both practical and theoretical understanding of mechatronics while working on group projects. They also develop the interpersonal and communication skills needed to work in a multi-disciplinary field. This study describes a group project-based approach for enabling teams of students to complete mechatronics projects. A set of heuristic guidelines is also proposed. At the National Changhua University of Education in the Department of Industrial Education and Technology, this approach has yielded high student satisfaction and achievement. 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The verdict of their solutions is computed using exhaustive test sets run under time, memory and security restrictions. By contrast to many popular online judges, Jutge.org is designed for students and instructors: On one hand, the problem repository is mainly aimed to beginners, with a clear organization and gradding. On the other hand, the system is designed as a virtual learning environment where instructors can administer their own courses, manage their roster of students and tutors, add problems, attach documents, create lists of problems, assignments, contests and exams. This paper presents Jutge.org and offers some case studies of courses using it.	programming language	Jordi Petit;Omer Giménez;Salvador Roura	2012		10.1145/2157136.2157267	simulation;computer science;knowledge management;software engineering;multimedia;active learning;programming language;pedagogy;virtual learning environment	HCI	-81.01395203261568	-37.647750196417846	38961

The Defense Acquisition University (DAU) is a consortium of Department of Defense education and training institutions and organizations that provides mandatory and assignment-specific courses for military and civilian personnel serving in 11 acquisition career fields. The DAU virtual campus is a unique model for World Wide Web-based instruction because it integrates all aspects of managing a corporate university while providing myriad dynamic layers of access privileges. The Operational Support System (OSS) provides functionality in 16 main areas, i.e., DAU public Web site, registration, enrollment, login, OSS user types, OSS collaboration tools, search, history, logs, reports, canned e-mail, feedback, help, courseware interfaces, test application, and database interfaces. The first section of the paper discusses why DAU is transitioning to the OSS. The second section summarizes the purpose of the OSS, including the following components: student registration, course enrollment, test delivery, course evaluation, student tracking, report generation, problem resolution, and site collaboration. The third section describes DAU's approach to developing courseware, including considerations related to learner interactions, testing and evaluation, and student-faculty interactions. The third section addresses defining the course structure, including test questions, deciding which OSS tools to integrate, and populating OSS tools.

Online courses have an advantage in this regard, since much of the course material is already written down in narrative form. Creating a book, though, is quite a different endeavor from creating an online course. If you're considering converting your online course to a book, at the outset you need to ask yourself certain interrelated questions...	book	Heather Hedden	2010	eLearn Magazine	10.1145/1754326.1754327	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;multimedia	NLP	-71.63942978048995	-29.668201644801467	39049

In our research, we exploit this synergy to develop CTSiM (Computational Thinking in Simulation and Modeling) - a cross-domain, visual programming and agent based, scaffolded environment for learning CT and science concepts simultaneously. CTSiM allows students to conceptualize and build computational models of scientific phenomena, execute the models as simulations, conduct experiments to verify the simulation behaviors against ‘expert behavior’, and use the models to solve real world problems.	computation;computational thinking	Satabdi Basu;Gautam Biswas	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-39112-5_146	psychology;mathematics education;applied mathematics;experiential learning;learning sciences;pedagogy	AI	-71.51132047067053	-41.00125881385498	39087
0d47d18db90b86c87744d508fb71ed725b436e7d	virtual reality in the e-society	virtual reality	This special issue explores the extent to which virtual reality (VR) is affecting the creation of an electronic society. E-Society is a broad term used to describe a research area covering aspects of digital technologies for large user communities. Recent years have seen the emergence of various electronic services in an attempt to facilitate everyday life and improve the way common tasks are being carried out. E-business and e-learning were of the first areas of e-Society to emerge. E-business refers to the use of information and communication technologies to facilitate transactions between businesses and customers or between businesses. Online shops, often called virtual shops offer customers the possibility to buy products through Internet. E-learning on the other hand encompasses technologies that allow teachers and students to interact either synchronously or asynchronously. E-government is another application of ICT for the benefit of e-Society, aiming to digitise services, informational or transactional offered to citizens and businesses and improve the exchange of information between governmental bodies. E-democracy is tightly coupled with e-voting, e-participation and e-inclusion, and aims to ameliorate and enhance democratic procedures, by providing the means necessary to citizens to participate in decision making and monitor governmental processes. Lastly, e-health describes the use of digital technologies in the health care sector. Services provided range from telemedicine and collaborative systems for patient diagnosis to online systems for medical records. As described, the term e-Society covers a wide range of applications from e-government, e-democracy, and e-business to e-learning and e-health. Although the term ‘‘virtual’’ is used in this context, such as for example in ‘‘virtual e-shops’’ or ‘‘virtual learning environments’’, it has to be stressed that it is has little to do with VR technologies. It is rather used to denote the fact that these ‘‘virtual’’ systems do not occupy space in the real-world. User interfaces for these systems usually fall into the typical windowing, 2D paradigm; thus the potential for using VR technologies in an emerging e-Society is enormous. VR technologies for visualising remotely health data, creating online communities, developing online stores or educating groups of people can contribute to the growth of the e-Society by making it more tangible and real for the users. In order for VR to contribute to the creation and advancement of e-Society, a number of issues have to be tackled. A successful VR system has to find a balance between the hardware requirements, user interaction methods, content presentation and the effort required for development and maintenance. Hardware requirements define to a large degree the extent to which an end-user can afford to execute the VR system at her home. VR systems span from online, G. D.

E-mail address: h.thinyane@ru.ac.za In 2001 Marc Prensky coined the phrase ‘digital natives’ to refer to the new generation of students who have grown up surrounded by technology. His companion papers spurred large amounts of research, debating changes that are required to curricula and pedagogical models to cater for the changes in the student population. This article reports on a study conducted in 2009 of more than 290 first year students at two South African universities. In this study, students were asked about their access to and use of technology. The results portrayed a heterogeneous student population, with varying levels of access to and use of most technologies. One of Prensky’s key features of a digital native is their excitement with Web 2.0 based technologies. Participants in this study however, appear not to use such technologies, and to not be interested in using them in their studies. One tool that students had high levels of access to (98.1%), and use of is the mobile phone. Out of all uses of technology surveyed, tasks involving the mobile phone were ranked in the top two positions. Also when asked to rank different uses of technology particularly for their studies, three of the top five uses relied on a mobile phone. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

However, little is known about design guidelines to optimize learning from video modeling examples. Given that the human face is known to capture observers’ attention, the question addressed in this study is whether seeing the model’s face in the video would help or hinder learning. Participants twice studied a video modeling example in which a problem-solving task was demonstrated and in which the model’s face was either visible or not, and after each view they attempted to solve the problem themselves. Their eye movement data were recorded while watching the video examples. Results show better performance after observing the second example in the condition that did see the model’s face. 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, for high technical e-training courses, not only the quality of the learning materials but also the efficiency of developing the courses needs to be taken into consideration. It is a challenging issue for experienced engineers to develop up-to-date e-training courses for inexperienced engineers before further new technologies are proposed. To cope with these problems, a concept relationship-oriented approach is proposed in this paper. A system for developing e-training courses has been implemented based on the novel approach. Experimental results showed that the novel approach can significantly shorten the time needed for developing e-training courses, such that engineers can receive up-to-date technologies in time.	experience	Judy C.

The pedagogical basis of this application is found in the support techniques for heuristic learning in mathematical problem solving developed according to the Schoenfeld model. The adaptivity of this tool is achieved by way of the utilization of an adaptive algorithm which has been developed for it and is described in this article. This algorithm implements mechanisms that make it possible for the user to construct mathematical knowledge adaptively using training methods. This application also provides the teacher with the following complete set of tools for managing the entire process: the inclusion of contents through a collaborative application with support; a shared work space; the adaptivity of the algorithm variables; and the supervision of the students’ progress, etc. through specific modules. This application was originally developed for educational contexts in the area of teaching mathematics, and therefore includes a module for editing and visualizing mathematical formulas for a Web environment.	adaptive algorithm;adaptive hypermedia;heuristic;internet;modular design;problem solving;web application;world wide web	Ana Belén Gil;Raquel Rodríguez;Francisco J.

11cb9317c556fb6b5298d75c57246ed380703fb3	online social networks analysis visualization using socii		Nowadays we face an age of massive Internet usage. With Online Social Networks (OSN) we practically live this parallel reality where everything we do and everyone we met is exposed and shared through these online “worlds”. Today, being able to study and understand how information flows and how relationships are built within these online networks is of paramount importance for various reasons, social, educational, political or economical. That is why social networks analysis has become an important scientific and technological challenge. In this paper, we propose the Socii system for social networks analysis and visualization. Socii aims at helping OSNs users to exploit and understand their own networks through a user friendly interface. The system relies in four main principles, namely simplicity, accessibility, OSNs integration and contextual analysis. Socii’s architecture and implementation technological choices are presented, together with its main functionalities.

e3abf998f25085e6a9b014dac3eb348f7934d927	looking into collaborative learning: design from macro- and micro-script perspectives		Design of collaborative learning (CL) scenarios is a complex task, but necessary if the goal of the collaboration is learning. Creating well-thought-out CL scenarios requires experience and knowledge about different learning/ instructional theories and practices related to collaboration. Inexperienced designers, who may not have all the needed knowledge to formulate pedagogically sound collaborative learning plans, may have difficulties to design CL activities. Thus, although CL has shown to be effective, it is not often used in classroom adequately. To tackle this problem, this paper presents an ontology for CL, that aims at modeling not only the learning activities, but also the rationale for their configuration in pedagogical terms. This ontology allows modeling the expected interactions among students as well as the mechanisms that promote or enhance collaboration structured across several sessions and involve individual and collaborative activities. Finally, the paper discusses an application of the presented ontology to support the design of pedagogically sound CL scenarios.	design rationale;experience;interaction;theory	Eloy D.

The digital noticeboard was created, upon a request by the community Elders, to foster communication across the community. The initial design, informed by discussions and consultations, aimed at supporting the local Aboriginal language and English, both in written and spoken form, at supporting the oral tradition, and at accommodating for different perceptions and representations of time. This paper presents observations about the first encounters with the digital noticeboard by those members of the community that took part in its conceptualization. Such observations reinforce existing knowledge on such cultural phenomena as collectivism and time perception, issues related to literacy, moderation and censorship. We contribute to framing such knowledge within a concrete case study and draw implication for design of tools for bi-cultural content publication.	conceptualization (information science);framing (world wide web)	Alessandro Soro;Margot Brereton;Anita Lee Hong;Paul Roe	2015		10.1145/2838739.2838813	human–computer interaction;collectivism;multimedia;moderation;literacy;management;cultural diversity	HCI	-66.20283177497079	-33.324990588001846	39697

Conceptual rationales and the design of a newly implemented “Information Technology in Education” (ITE) course, which is based on the model of instructional design, are described. An accompanying longitudinal study is presented. Improvements in trainee teachers' ICT-related general cognitive and technical capabilities; changes in beliefs about the use of ICT in their future career; and the ITE course learning experience are analysed. It was found that the implemented model of ICT literacy training fits best for more mature students who aim to acquire advanced technical skills and/or gain understanding of the use of ICT in the teaching profession. Research implications for future improvements of the pre-service teachers' ICT training are discussed.

756b68bde024aabf75908303c7c80d3ab2eb846a	evaluation of multimedia programs in sport science education		When developing multimedia as an educational tool formative and summative evaluations should be applied during this process. Among other aspects, these evaluations can pertain to the extent and way of use, the learning contents and their formal presentation, the learning results, the acceptability and the usability of the multimedia tool. Furthermore effectivity and efficiency of the multimedia program can be examined. Several qualitative and quantitative tools can be applied (Wandmacher, 2000), e.g., expert evaluation according to specific models of cognition, perception and action, discussions and interviews with users, observation of users in real-life or laboratory, heuristic evaluation, using paper or electronic prototypes or scenario techniques. In our institute we are currently developing three multimedia tools for education: − Program “EidS” for introduction to studying sport sciences. This program is used as a supplement for a course “introduction to the study of sport science” that is offered to freshmen of sport science. − Program “BWS-CBT” for introduction to movement science. This program is applied as a supplement for a lecture “basics of movement science in sport”. − Program “BioPrinz” for introduction to the principles of biomechanics. This program is applied as a supplement for a course “introduction to biomechanics of sport”. During the development process we apply the following research methods: − thinking aloud while using the programs: The user applies the program and all his verbal behavior is recorded by a researcher. − qualitative interviews concerning the programs: Based on the subjective impression concerning the most salient advantages and disadvantages of the program we perform an interview in order to get more to know about the program, how it is used and which problems arise. − two questionnaires concerning form, content and usability of the programs: the ISO norm 9241/10 questionnaire deals with seven dialogue principles (suitability for the task, self descriptiveness, controllability, conformity with user expectations, error tolerance, suitability for individualisation and suitability for learning), while the self-developed questionnaire focuses on specific aspects of form, content and use of the particular multimedia program. − logs documenting the experiences with the actual use of the program: for each use of the program users have to document time, duration, used contents and experiences. In the contribution parts of the programs are presented and the methods for evaluations are discussed. Selected results will be presented.	cognition;cognitive model;conformity;error-tolerant design;heuristic evaluation;real life;software documentation;usability	Josef Wiemeyer	2002	Int. J. Comp. Sci.

60e68aab2e59c1fda295a6d8b3c2cfd7f7f1d9c4	ontological search for academic resources		Active methodologies promote students' elaboration of knowledge-based resources susceptible to being used as a learning tool. However, due to their quantity, variety and the technology used, it is difficult to manage them, mainly as regards the consultation and identification of the most appropriate resources to carry out a specific training action. A possible solution would be to develop (1) a repository that offers an overview of all resources generated, regardless of the technology, variety and types; (2) an ontology, which permits their classification; and (3) a semantic search system that allows a user to make a quick and effective retrieval. This research-based paper shows the results obtained using a content manager, which centralizes the resources created by the students in some technologies. Also, two tools have been developed: an ontology, which permits resources of a subject to be classified, and a plugin for WordPress, which allows the ontologies are building through the use of tags and categories, as well as to provide them with a semantic search engine through inferences between ontology-related elements---. Through a result cross-check, students' perception of the repository use has been measured. It has been found that, on the one hand, the system proposed is adequate to manage the resources generated by the students; and, on the other, their availability has been useful for them.	knowledge-based systems;ontology (information science);semantic search;web search engine;wordpress	Ángel Fidalgo-Blanco;María Sánchez-Canales;María Luisa Sein-Echaluce;Francisco J.

Computer-supported collaboration scripts generally suffer from the problem of being restrained to a specific learning platform and learning context. Researchers are therefore aiming for a formalization of collaboration scripts on both a conceptual and a computational level. A recently developed framework allows to describe collaboration scripts using a small number of components (participants, activities, roles, resources and groups) and mechanisms (task distribution, group formation and sequencing). Based on these, a formal, graphical modelling tool has been developed and tested with several example scripts.

They are here selected for an ethnographic study since their continuous content generation can teach us something of what it takes for amateurs, who currently struggle with mastering the video medium, to become proficient producers. We learn from media theory that Pro-Ams are distinguished from professionals in terms of inherent skills and identities, and have therefore focused on these characteristics. We add to this research by showing on-going challenges that the former face in their production, i.e. how their learning practices, such as learning through instructions, are situated and related to particular settings. Learning and development of skills were done as organizations, rather than as individuals. Furthermore, the recurrent nature of both events and broadcasts appears to be an important condition for establishing the terms needed to carry out a production, and to learn the skills of a producer. This understanding may explain in part why accounts in previous research, of single users struggling with the affordances of live video, point to such difficulties in mastering the medium. The findings guide design to better support activities contiguous with the set-up of the production, rather than the broadcast per se.	bus mastering;camera phone;long tail;multi-user;recurrent neural network;situated;video production	Oskar Juhlin;Arvid Engström;Elin Önnevall	2014		10.1145/2556288.2557315	simulation;video;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia;camera phone;ethnography;user-generated content;management;world wide web;negotiation	HCI	-66.77360193227463	-39.26694921420612	39951

One hundred nine subjects participated in the study, which was conducted in a field setting with the Blackboard system, a Web-based class management system. A survey was administered after a 2-week trial period and the actual use of the system was recorded by the Blackboard system over 8 weeks. The results largely support the proposed model, highlighting the important roles of self-efficacy, enjoyment, and learning goal orientation in determining the actual use of the system.

cc943d1fe9fb957e8413d4f5c47d134c3cb69039	what's right about fair-use guidelines for the academic community?		Are fair-use guidelines advisable for the academic community? Experience has demonstrated that fair-use guidelines do assist organizations and individuals who wish to comply with the copyright law. Guidelines help clarify and simplify the application of fair-use principles when educators reproduce and use copies of copyrighted works without permission for nonprofit educational purposes. Although the Copyright Act of 1976 provides four nonexclusive fair-use factors for evaluating proposed fair uses, these factors are often characterized as vague and ambiguous standards that do not provide specific guidance for educators, and are subjective in their interpretation. Scholars, educators, and students who follow the criteria outlined in mutually accepted educational fair-use guidelines, which have been developed through a collaborative negotiation process that includes endorsements from both user and rightsholder organizations, can be assured of a “safe harbor” in which users are acting within the spirit of copyright principles and are not in violation of the law when they abide by the criteria in endorsed guidelines. Such guidelines do not limit the application of fair-use principles because individual fair use does extend beyond endorsed guidelines, although every use beyond the guidelines’ agreed-upon criteria must be individually evaluated according to the vague fair-use factors of the copyright law, which are open to various interpretations.	international safe harbor privacy principles;vagueness	Mary Levering	1999	JASIS	10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(1999)50:14%3C1313::AID-ASI8%3E3.0.CO;2-4		HCI	-76.26118145714574	-26.40563454156288	40045

This study compares the outcomes from a similar course in a similar setting using very different learning platforms designed by the same research group. The tool used in the first course, EDUCO, offers awareness of other learners by real-time social navigation features. The tool used in the second course, EDUCOSM, relies on easy-to-make joint asynchronous annotations on documents. The pedagogical model for the courses was the same: student-centered learning in self-organizing and self-evolving groups using peer support to tackle open-ended large problems. The results suggest that the learning outcomes can vary, especially in a case where the environment is open and transparent in a sense that it enables learners to easily rely on and help each other in peer-to-peer fashion.	nonlinear gameplay;organizing (structure);peer-to-peer;real-time transcription;self-organization	Jaakko Kurhila;Miikka Miettinen;Petri Nokelainen;Henry Tirri	2004	IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies, 2004.

While the internet, as intended, connects us to information, products and services, it often draws us away from the rich connections that are created through interpersonal communication. The goal of this work is to use the machine to connect people. Not only to information, products or services, but also to each other. The author proposes to use the machine, the very machine that pulls us apart, to bring us together, connecting people through stories. People tell stories as a way to be less lonesome, reaching out to people that they can relate to. The system that the author describes in this article is intended to facilitate and amplify connections between people through stories. Buzz is a digital theatre installation that autonomously finds and exposes the most emotional stories from the millions of blog postings on the web, bringing the stories to life with a cast of virtual actors using speech synthesis. This system serves the goal of using the machine to connect people, not only to information or products, but also to each other.	blog;internet;speech synthesis;virtual actor	Sara Owsley Sood	2008	IJART	10.1504/IJART.2008.019887	virtual actor;emotion;digital art;computer science;multimedia;narrative;communication;speech synthesis;iron;world wide web;interpersonal communication	HCI	-63.12169572345905	-26.441670410679915	40158

By teaching the skills of policy reasoning, journalism, and activism, AIED techniques can be used to train an alert and knowledgeable citizenry that can in turn demand policies that promote social inclusion. Unlike the AIED export approach in which we adapt AIED technologies to work in the technological infrastructures of poor countries, AIED for civic engagement could be deployed in rich countries to promote social inclusion in both rich and poor countries. This is because rich country policy often impacts poor country development, and an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can demand more socially inclusive international policies.	artificial intelligence	Fabio N.

For the University of Cape Town’s (UCT) large film and media studies courses, it is impractical simply to use the technology of professionals as this would typically be too expensive to purchase and time-consuming to run. Our approach has been to develop activities that can run with large classes in generic computer laboratories and which simulate environments and tools of the real world. Two illustrative examples, emphasising writing skills in context, involve the production of a TV news story and the development of a proposal for an educational soap opera. Using these, we reflect on our experience of integrating practical skills into the curriculum of a traditional academic institution, where these skills have a lower status and must be sufficiently flexible to accommodate changes in the higher-status academic components. This suggests that such flexibility has to be part of the design of practical interventions and that they should additionally aim to provide a challenge to some of the more theoretical aspects of these courses. While developing one’s own interventions allows for some of this flexibility to be incorporated into the design, it remains difficult for academic departments to adopt these solutions as their own, thus requiring continued involvement of the original developers to adapt to changes.

Assignments for the first basic course cover the first three levels of Bloom’s taxonomy: remembering, understanding and applying, with some elements of creativity. Assignments for the advanced course cover the upper three levels of Bloom’s taxonomy: analysing, evaluating and creating. To stimulate student interest in purposeful learning it is essential to strike a balance between student engagement and the courses’ learning outcomes as determined by the curriculum. To achieve these goals the following course structure possibilities were analysed: creative elements in assignments; continuous and formative assessment with two-phase feedback; premium grading points; and external motivators. Dependence of the final grade on the prior subject matter knowledge of students was also analysed.

In this paper, our approach gamifying the learning process of a subject is presented. Our experience throughout time in using games and gamification in learning have led us to propose, lately, a personalized, automated, and gamified learning system. As a result of this experience and after several years of continuous feedback from our students, we have learned several lessons on how to approach the task of gamification. These lessons are summarized in the following concepts: fun, motivation, autonomy, progressiveness, feedback, error tolerance, experimentation, creativity, and adaptation to the specific case. The final aim is sharing our experience and opening a debate about what key elements the gamification lie in.	autonomy;biological system;cognition;cognitive science;cycle (graph theory);dopamine;error-tolerant design;experiment;gamification;pattern recognition;penetration test;personalization	Faraón Llorens-Largo;Francisco José Gallego-Durán;Carlos Villagrá;Patricia Compañ-Rosique;Rosana Satorre-Cuerda;Rafael Molina-Carmona	2016	IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje	10.1109/RITA.2016.2619138	games;trial and error;simulation;motivation;human–computer interaction;computer science;engineering;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;feedback;autonomy;multimedia;management;world wide web;mechanical engineering	Vision	-67.38370977451717	-38.18631016192162	40273

Some have been said to demonstrate an individual advantage, some a social advantage. While there is a great deal of general literature on this field, however, the specific web-based conductive learning is relatively unexplored. We proposed a Chemistry Online Argumentation Courseware (COAC) for enhancing 10th grade students' learning with website exploring conductive components where senior high school students can easily navigate the embedded website links and create effective scientific arguments. The purpose of this paper is to report on an investigation of learners' online argumentation activity. Answers were sought to the question: how does the website exploring strategy influence students' argumentation performance on our conductive COAC. Qualitative results suggested that both Individual and Social group learners had significant improvements in their argumentation ability with the support of website exploring. This study further suggested that the benefit of website exploring argumentation-strategies instruction to the Individual group learners in the chemistry course, they improved fast enough to attain the same progress as the collaborative learners regarding argumentation-based learning. The findings of this study could serve as some general principles for teachers who would like to improve students' website learning strategy use.	embedded system;web application	Kai-Yi Huang;Yi-Lin Cheng;Hsiao-Ching She;Yu-Ren Lin	2015	2015 IEEE 15th International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies	10.1109/ICALT.2015.101	computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;knowledge engineering;multimedia;management;world wide web;collaboration	HCI	-76.78690808919245	-42.627505629475294	40294

However, synchronous communication does not afford as much time for reflection as asynchronous communication. Therefore, a combination of synchronous and asynchronous communication in e-learning would seem desirable to optimally support learner engagement and quality of student learning. It is still an open question though, how to best design online learning with a blend of synchronous and asynchronous communication opportunities over time. Few studies have investigated the relationship between learners’ actual use of synchronous and asynchronous communication over time. Therefore, this study addresses that relationship in an online course (N = 110), taking into account student motivation, and employing a dynamic intertemporal perspective. In line with our assumptions, we found some support for the expected association between autonomous motivation and engagement in asynchronous and synchronous communication, be it restricted primarily to the first course period. Also, positive relations between engagement in synchronous and asynchronous communication were found, with the strongest influence from using asynchronous to synchronous communication. This study adds to the knowledge base needed to develop guidelines on how synchronous communication can be combined with asynchronous learning.	asynchronous i/o;autonomous robot;knowledge base	Bas Giesbers;Bart Rienties;Dirk T.

Among the primary objectives of their members has been to share digital learning resources and increase the community's collective knowledge by communicating and collaborating online. In this paper, we discuss how the learning object paradigm can be exploited to support web-based learning communities and online communities of practice, as a means to enhance the services already provided by Educational Portals (EP). It is claimed that this can be achieved by motivating the active interaction of community members with the EPs' resources and at the same time allowing the dynamic update of the available resources taking into account the community's collective knowledge on the real use of the resources. To this end, we present the ASK e-Educational Communities Environment (ASK e-EDCOM), a web-based environment for the empowerment of online educational communities.	portals;web application	Demetrios G.

We use the 4MAT model as the theoretical underpinning to explore and develop some illustrative interactive tutorials to support the teaching of OR/MS spreadsheet modeling. Due to a much shallower learning curve on the new generation of screen capture technology, the design and creation of such spreadsheet support modules can now realistically be done by individual faculty in a reasonable amount of time. Three levels of interactivity are used in the modules to match the learning stages of the 4MAT model. We discuss implementation issues with current screen capture software and the benefits and limitations of this approach for supporting the teaching of spreadsheet modeling in OR/MS.	interactivity;mind;spreadsheet	Linda Leon;Kala Chand Seal;Zbigniew H.

Moreover, because website privacy policy presentations vary from website to website, policies are difficult to compare and it is difficult for consumers to determine which websites offer the best privacy protections. The Platform for Privacy Preferences P3P) addresses part of the problem with natural language policies by providing a formal, machine-readable language for expressing privacy policies in a manner that is standardized across websites. To address remaining problems, an automated tool must be developed to read P3P policies and display them to users in a comprehensible way. To this end, we have developed a P3P policy presentation tool based on the Expandable Grid, a visualization technique for displaying policies in an interactive matrix. In prior work, the Expandable Grid has been shown to work well for displaying file permissions policies, so it appears to hold promise for presenting online privacy policies as well. To evaluate our Expandable Grid interface, we conducted two user studies, an online study with 520 participants and a laboratory study with 12 participants. The studies compared participants' comprehension of privacy policies presented with the Grid interface with their comprehension of the same policies presented in natural language. To our surprise, comprehension of policies was, for the most part, no better with the Grid interface than with natural language. We describe why the Grid interface did not perform well in our study and discuss implications for when and how the Expandable Grid concept can be usefully applied.		Robert W.

Capturing and analysis of user requirements and tasks are concepts that have frequently been suggested to address central problems within system development in recent years. In this research the use of a variety of Task Analysis (TA) methods has been used to assess the adequacy of a proposed design for a “World Wide Web (WWW)” system within an Interactive MultiMedia (IMM) context, domain and environment which will help research students conduct their doctoral program as carried out at Salford University, Manchester, UK. The results of the application for TA methods and their input into the design activities have been analyzed and compared both to each other and to a framework (desirable criteria). The findings have shown that TA methods have a number of weaknesses in the contributions that they make and therefore questions of how the methods can be improved to increase their capability were considered.	requirement;task analysis;user requirements document;www;world wide web	Yousef H.

Governments, medical researchers, healthcare providers in the public and private sector, drug companies, health consumer groups, and individuals are increasingly looking to the Internet to both access and distribute health information, communicate with each other, and form supportive or collaborative online communities. Evaluating the accuracy, provenance, authority, and reliability of Web-based health information is a major priority. The Breast Cancer Knowledge Online Portal project (BCKOnline) explored the individual and changing information and decision support needs of women with breast cancer and the issues they face when searching for relevant and reliable health information on the Internet. Its user-sensitive research design integrated multidisciplinary methods including user information-needs analysis, knowledge-domain mapping, metadata modeling, and systems-development research techniques. The main outcomes were a personalized information portal driven by a metadata repository of user-sensitive resource descriptions, the BCKOnline Metadata Schema, richer understandings of the concepts of quality, relevance, and reliability, and a user-sensitive design methodology. This article focuses on the innovative, metadata-based quality reporting feature of the BCKOnline Portal, and concludes that it is timely to consider the inclusion of quality elements in resource discovery metadata schema, especially in the health domain.	autonomy;decision support system;emergence;information quality;internet;metadata modeling;metadata repository;needs analysis;online community;personalization;portals;programming paradigm;relevance;self-information;websphere portal	Sue McKemmish;Rosetta Manaszewicz;Frada Burstein;Julie Fisher	2009	JASIST	10.1002/asi.21096	computer science;knowledge management;breast cancer;data mining;information quality;metadata;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-66.3298307194107	-28.498659407606596	40664

We were particularly interested in determining how well these features managed to maintain children's engagement over the 8-week training period. The children (N ¼ 138) used GraphoGame, a web-based game training letter–sound connections, at home under the supervision of parents. Data regarding the children's gaming and engagement were stored on the GraphoGame online server. A 2 Â 2 factorial design was used to investigate the effects of the level of challenge (high challenge vs. high success) and the presence of the reward system (present vs. absent). Children's engagement was measured by session frequency and duration and through an in-game self-report survey that was presented at the end of the each session. According to the results, the children enjoyed GraphoGame but used it less frequently than expected. The reward system seemed to encourage the children to play longer sessions at the beginning of the training period, but this effect vanished after a few sessions. The level of challenge had no significant effect on children's engagement. The results suggest a need to investigate further the effectiveness of various game features in maintaining learner's engagement until the goals set for learning are achieved. Playing computer games is a popular leisure-time activity among young children. In Finland, 84 percent of first graders play computer games at least sometimes, 31 percent every day (Hirvonen, 2012). Computer games can hold children's attention for hours a day, so it is not surprising that many parents and teachers are interested in their potential as educational and motivational tools. Several studies suggest that children enjoy computer-based learning tasks more than traditional learning tasks Despite the apparent motivational appeal of digital learning, little experimental research concerning the long-term development of engagement during digital game-based learning has been conducted. When computer-based learning activities or games are introduced to young learners, they typically trigger curiosity and interest (Mitchell, 1993; Seymour et al., 1987). However, this type of interest is situational, triggered by environmental stimuli and it may or may not last over time (Hidi & Renninger, 2006). Some earlier studies imply that interest triggered by educational software may be short-, but also relatively long-lasting interest has been observed (Rosas et al., 2003). If the situational interest triggered by a novel learning tool can …	pc game;renninger negative-result experiment;server (computing);virtual world;web application;word lists by frequency	Miia Ronimus;Janne V.

A pre-test/post-test comparisongroup experiment was conducted with 23 participants involved in the study. Participating students were randomly assigned either to the interactive 3D media representation group (n = 13) or the conventional 2D media representation group (n = 10); learning materials in both groups deliver the same information to students, but employ different media representations. All the activities were performed in a self-paced, web-based instructional system. The results of ANCOVA analysis showed statistically insignificant difference between groups in terms of students’ post-test scores on the spatial visualization ability test with the students’ pre-test scores as the covariate. However, a medium effect size was observed in favor of the 3D group in terms of practical significance. As a pilot study with a small sample size aiming to probe the research direction of this problem, the result of mediumsized effect magnitude is likely to implicate that the discrepancy of different representational design on students’ performance of spatial ability assessment is noteworthy. Future study of this nature appears to merit further replications and investigations. 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

While active learning pedagogies are more often employed in lower divisional CS courses, systems classes-such as OS, architecture, and networks-are just beginning to see a shift from standard lecture to active learning. This BOF will provide a forum for sharing ideas of how to integrate active learning techniques into systems courses, using the following questions as starting points: What are active learning techniques, and how are they used? What impact does active learning have on coverage? Must adoption of active learning techniques entail abandoning lectures entirely? If not, how can I use active learning to augment, rather than replace, my lectures? What transitional steps can I take toward active learning methodologies?

In this context, we have integrated a mainstream first-person shooter game, Counter-Strike, into the curriculum of our Autonomous Agents and Multi-agent Systems course. In this paper we describe this integration and a platform to support the creation of Counter-Strike agents. In addition, a questionnaire was posed to our students to assess the success of our approach. Results show that students found the idea of applying a first-person- shooter game motivating and the integration with the curriculum useful for their education.	autonomous agents and multi-agent systems;educational entertainment;multi-agent system;pc game	Celso de Melo;Rui Prada;Guilherme Raimundo;Joana Paulo Pardal;Helena Sofia Pinto;Ana Paiva	2006	2006 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Intelligent Agent Technology	10.1109/IAT.2006.86	simulation;human–computer interaction;engineering;multimedia	Robotics	-82.89639669323438	-36.74524966028142	41261
4676710a097a26fba6824a4c996bbbff2a0b61e8	developing and implementing an accessible, touch-based web app for inclusive learning		With the prevalence of mobile devices and platforms used throughout the world and the increasing number of organizations with mobile versions of their web sites, it is essential that those applications and sites are accessible, usable and flexible. This project involved the inclusive development and iterative evaluation of a platform-independent, web-based learning app. Usability testing with students, faculty, and individuals with disabilities were combined with manual accessibility evaluations to ensure that a wide range of users and devices would be able to benefit from the structure of such an application. The results of this project detail the process of creating a flexible, platform-independent mobile learning app as well as some of the broader benefits that can result from accessibility and usability improvements to a mobile application. The resulting prototype has been implemented in a “live” environment at a non-profit organization that serves individuals with disabilities.	accessibility;iterative method;mobile app;mobile device;prototype;usability testing;web application	Emily Dickson;Justin Null;Warren Skinner;Jordan Swogger;Andrew Thompson;Brian Wentz	2015			human–computer interaction;web accessibility initiative;engineering;web accessibility;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-63.7752136934479	-44.82437820025674	41266

To resolve this problem, the MKD plays an important role by providing a clear structure map of the course, helping user to realize about the appropriate learning path as well as the knowledge relationship. In this article, a method of constructing a usable MKD in Chinese has been raised based on online courses. The online course data are obtained by web crawling from the MOOCs sites, then processed through the data clean and data fusion after which the MKD is extracted and evaluated. This method is applied to all the existing MOOCs courses thus has showed practical significance.

Researchers need to probe into serious questions about the nature, role, and impact of specific attributes of information (e.g., information systems, resources, skills, and processes) in education. Although most educators would agree that all education is information-based to some degree, there is no unifying framework, model, theory, methodology, or even vocabulary for considering the nature and impact of specific information attributes. This paper seeks to describe the concept of information-based education (IBE), provide a theoretical basis for conducting a broad and systematic investigation into the role and use of information in educational situations, and commence the development of a classification scheme for documenting and distinguishing among various information bases. This classification scheme will form the necessary foundation for conducting field studies about information use in education, as well as foster consideration of information attributes when planning and delivering instruction, with implications for the development and implementation of computer-based information systems in educational situations.

c06a722575a20038e49c1d1216967c191fa0f116	an investigation of the impact of a social constructivist teaching approach, based on trigger questions, through measures of mental workload and efficiency		Social constructivism is grounded on the construction of information with a focus on collaborative learning through social interactions. However, it tends to ignore the human mental architecture, pillar of cognitivism. A characteristic of cognitivism is that instructional designs built upon it are generally explicit, contrarily to constructivism. This position paper proposes a novel learning task that is aimed at combining both the approaches through the use of trigger questions in a collaborative activity executed after a traditional delivery of instructions. To evaluate this new task, a metric of efficiency based upon a measure of mental workload and a measure of performance is proposed. The former measure is taken from Ergonomics, and two well know subjective self-reporting mental workload assessment techniques are envisioned. The latter measure is taken from an objective quantitative assessment of the performance of learners employing concept maps.	concept map;human factors and ergonomics;interaction;social constructivism	Giuliano Orru;Federico Gobbo;Declan O'Sullivan;Luca Longo	2018		10.5220/0006790702920302	knowledge management;workload;social constructivism;computer science	HCI	-75.72840155822385	-45.17235301562135	41313

Numerous authors have questioned how to position biomedical informatics along the continuum of formal, empirical and engineering disciplines. A concern with current educational programs in biomedical informatics is that students finish without a clear understanding of the relation between theory and practice, or worse, with the impression that the field does not possess any theoretical basis. In this paper, we propose that biomedical informatics curricula explicitly address skills and competencies at three levels: formal, empirical, and applied. We posit that that knowledge of formalization is necessary to build testable empirical models, and that model-driven approaches are necessary for deploying information systems that can be evaluated in a meaningful way. A curricular framework is proposed that identifies a set of methods, techniques and theories that have broad applicability within the domain of biomedicine, and which can span a wide range of application areas: bioinformatics, imaging informatics, clinical informatics and public health informatics. A stronger linkage between theory and practice will result in students who are empowered to create effective and lasting solutions to biomedical problems.		Stephen B. Johnson	2003	AMIA ...

The universities charge each student a notebook fee which is typically around $1,000 per year. Usually, each university owns or leases the computers and tries to replace them every two years. Northwest Missouri State University has implemented a system to provide notebooks to every student living on-campus by increasing residence hall and tuition technology fees for a total cost of about $300 per year. Students living off-campus also have the option to rent a notebook computer at a similar cost.Northwest's model for providing notebooks to students has several key features. First, the notebooks are purchased by the university and the expected life cycle is three years. Second, the notebooks are purchased with a three-year warranty and students are responsible for providing damage and theft insurance. Third, the university owns the computers and utilizes volume independent licenses for most software. Finally with 2,500 student notebooks to support, Northwest has only 2.5 FTE staff positions for maintenance and repair of these units.With Northwest's computing model, higher expectations can be set for freshman academic assignments, since they are required to live on-campus and faculty can depend on students having access to standardized computing resources. Experience has shown that upper-classmen try to stay compatible with the computing model they have used for one or more years.This paper will discuss the challenges and benefits of implementing a low-cost, university-owned notebook computing model.	computer;experience;laptop	Jon Rickman;Merlin Miller;Tabatha Verbick;Kim Todd	2006		10.1145/1181216.1181287	simulation;engineering;operations management	HPC	-68.77370287031474	-24.800155348580716	41366

Findings from a series of four interviews conducted with a purposeful sample of nine students revealed that the primary reflective experience with programming assignments was emotional. That is, the way students remembered and discussed their experiences with programming assignments was dominated by emotional experiences and reactions. We identified six stages whose dimensions capture the variation in students' emotional experiences with programming assignments. This paper reports the beginnings of analysis geared at developing a theory of students' programming assignment experience, rich in detail and grounded in student experience. When completed such a theory may lead to curricular supports, interventions, or tools, to help steer student experience away from the most harmful of emotional tolls.	experience;theory	Päivi Kinnunen;Beth Simon	2010		10.1145/1839594.1839609	psychology;simulation;developmental psychology;emotion;comparative method;multimedia;social psychology;pedagogy	HCI	-72.86494403136939	-43.34066447563063	41367
0fa8d7483f28bd40885403b3567f2833fbe1e149	facilitating peer learning and knowledge sharing in stem courses via pattern based graph visualization		High quality education in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) majors expects not only the acquisition of comprehensive domain knowledge, but also the mastery of skills to solve open ended and even ill-defined problems. Problem-based Learning (PBL) is usually adopted to achieve such goals. However, PBL requires sustained and indepth faculty involvement, hence making PBL not scalable. Also, existing knowledge discovery techniques do not facilitate the capture and reuse of solutions to recurring problems. To address these challenges, we present MicroBrowser, an interactive Q&A system augmented with 2D discussion visualizations and pattern based expertise sharing interfaces. MicroBrowser allows learners to browse and navigate important discussions in PBL based on topic similarity encoded by node proximity in a knowledge graph. MicroBrowser also provides a set of pattern based expertise sharing interfaces to allow both learners and instructors to highlight, share and reuse major findings in PBL. Through a 32subject study, we found MicroBrowser to be effective at facilitating knowledge discovery. Moreover, students understood and were able to use design patterns to complete open ended	browsing;design pattern;knowledge graph;off topic;scalability	Emilio Zegarra;Shi-Kuo Chang;Jingtao Wang	2015		10.18293/SEKE2015-6		HCI	-70.75110880674026	-41.17002831890306	41399

However, participants join such spaces through the lenses of their established discursive practices. These practices, however, interact with the code – the technological design – of these spaces, which can reproduce, question, or undermine them, and present alternative opportunities and visions for knowledge communication. Participants, therefore, ultimately face questions about the ways in which tensions between established (genred) practices and alternative practices enabled by code are to be negotiated. Drawing on theories of rhetoric and technology, this article offers an integrated theoretical framework that allows developers of online communities to examine the established rhetorical practices of participants and the ways in which the code of the discursive space may question or facilitate these practices. The paper then illustrates how this framework may be applied to facilitating academic knowledge communication in a wiki space and concludes with implications for decision-making in shaping digital discursive spaces for knowledge communication.	noise shaping;online community;theory;virtual community;web application;wiki	Doreen Starke-Meyerring	2008	IJWBC	10.1504/IJWBC.2008.019547	computer science;knowledge management;multimedia;knowledge;communication;law;world wide web;code	HCI	-65.15859130667907	-34.150722194881375	41469

However, there are not enough teachers who are prepared to teach computer science. Interactive electronic books (ebooks) are a promising approach for providing low-cost professional development in computer science. Over the last four years, our research group has been conducting design-based research by iteratively developing and testing versions of a teacher ebook to help secondary teachers with no programming experience learn to teach an introductory programming course. The interactive elements in the ebook were designed based on research results from educational psychology and are intended to make learning more efficient and effective. Our goals for this effort are to increase teachers' knowledge of computer science concepts and to improve teachers' confidence in their ability to teach computer science. In this paper we summarize our previous work and report on a large-scale study of version two of the teacher ebook. We also recommend several design principles for interactive ebooks for computing teachers based on feedback from teachers, log file analyses, and randomized controlled studies.	book;computer science;e-book;randomized algorithm	Barbara Ericson;Kantwon Rogers;Miranda C.

One aspect of object-oriented (OO) approaches to system design that appeals to many adopting organizations is the purported naturalness, i.e. the consistency of OO approaches with these cognitive activities of problem solving. Essentially, OO aims to abstract components of the problem of system development to a high level that parallels problem solving in the world the system represents. In other words, knowing how a problem is solved in the real world informs one about how the OO system solves the problem. Thus, the OO development process and the resulting OO model are believed to be consistent with innate cognitive activities and consistent with the problem/real world, respectively. A cognitive mapping method was used to ask graduate students experienced with OO techniques about their perceptions of what is complex (di$cult to understand) about OO systems. Their responses include a set of concepts, categories of similar concepts and cognitive maps that reveal what they believe is di$cult about using OO techniques. Evaluating these perceptions in terms of the cognitive activities of system design reveals problem decomposition was perceived as the activity that caused the most di$culties related to learning OO techniques. Problem understanding was the goal of the participants, while the solution activity ranked lower in importance but contained many issues essential to systems development and in#uenced problem understanding.

For acquiring new skills or knowledge, contemporary learners frequently rely on the help of educational technologies supplementing human teachers as a learning aid. In the interaction with such systems, speech-based communication between the human user and the technical system has increasingly gained importance. Since spoken computer output can take on a variety of forms depending on the method of speech generation and the employment of prosodic modulations, the effects of such auditory variations on the user's learning achievement require systematic investigation. The experiment reported here examined the specific effects of speech generation method and prosody of spoken system feedback in a computer-supported learning environment, and may serve as validational tool for future investigations of spoken computer feedback effects on learning. Learning performance in a basic cognitive task was compared between users receiving pre-recorded, naturally spoken system feedback with neutral prosody, pre-recorded feedback with motivating (praising or blaming) prosody, or computer-synthesized feedback. The observed results provide empirical evidence that users of technical tutoring systems benefit from pre-recorded, naturally spoken feedback, and do even more so from feedback with motivational prosodic modulations matching their performance success.

a82cdb1ce978bb843ad7778a7c2e12d11db7d727	development of a method to study real-time engineering writing processes		Engineering writing and communication is increasingly required of engineering undergraduate and graduate students; yet this call is rarely met through research-based methods. This research posits that deep investigation of the cognitive processes within engineering writing requires a novel method for data time-dependent analysis. However, no such method exists. This paper details our decision-making processes as we examine the available methods to analyze screen-capture video data of real time writing in an authentic engineering writing context. We detail the process of selecting the most appropriate approach and then provide a proof of concept for this method though analysis of screen capture video data of authentic engineering writing spanning several weeks. Complex issues in engineering education require creative interpretations of what can be used as “data,” and similarly, creative and rigorous solutions for analysis. The results of this paper directly affect researchers doing real-time analysis of video data in all respects, and will also help other engineering education researchers to analyze non-traditional data.	amiga reflections;best practice;file spanning;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;screenshot	Catherine G.

e08ca055aa43cb3b16102b2d4b454be7217eff43	a framework for easier designs: augmented intelligence in serious games for cognitive development		For interdisciplinary researchers, designing and implementing fully intelligent interactive systems, such as intelligent serious games (SGs), is a difficult task. In this article, we present an alternative approach: a fast development and deployment framework for creating intelligent SGs. The framework enables human intervention in games and uses human intelligence to reduce or eliminate the need for complex intelligent engines in games. In addition, the framework is portable, meaning that the derived video games can be used in various settings, such as at home or in therapy sessions. It also provides an environment where parents and caregivers can develop social interactions with children with special needs, which is often difficult in natural environments.

Sims). In recent years, the cross-boundary technology exchange between game and simulation technology, along with other factors, has contributed to the confusion as to what makes a simulation game and what makes a simulator. This article provides a user's and designer's perspective on a definitive comparison of the similarities and differences between games in general, simulation games, and simulators. It also introduces a method that can be easily used to distinguish games and simulation games from simulators by using observable design characteristics. On the other hand, the convergence of functionality and technology in simulation games and simulators has created new applications of simulation. One such application is in serious games. Serious games and simulation games are confusingly similar in many ways. However, they greatly differ in functionality. This article also provides a method to distinguish serious games from simulation games, to clarify the strict categorization between these two applications of simulation.	categorization;observable;personal computer;simulation	Viknashvaran Narayanasamy;Kevin Kok Wai Wong;Lance Chun Che Fung;Shri Rai	2006	Computers in Entertainment	10.1145/1129006.1129021	computer simulation;video game design;combinatorial game theory;simulation;turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games;computer science;theoretical computer science;emergent gameplay;game mechanics;multimedia;simulations and games in economics education	ECom	-64.74893825342352	-41.76123031024305	41862

Several models of the cognitive process are reviewed to distill awareness drivers that, when regarded in the collaboration context, set up a comprehensive view of collaboration awareness. Our major research goal is developing collaboration awareness support taking into consideration the need to provide awareness about the group but also the need to preserve cognitive load. The selected case study involved brainstorming. We developed a brainstorming tool having a collaboration awareness component that automatically balances the parallel production of ideas and the cognitive stimulation of users by reading the others' ideas. This balance is based on a set of heuristics regarding task switching and cognitive load. The experimental results indicate the component increased the production of ideas by 9.6%, while giving users 54.7% more time to type ideas without being interrupted. These results suggest the collaboration awareness component could effectively balance individual and group work. These results contribute to improve awareness support in collaboration technology.

The use of quizzes aims to improve the learning process during its progress. Our use of self-assessment has combined with traditional lectures, as benefit, since it allows self-driven recovery learning paths. Much attention has been paid to construct effective close-ended questions apt to actually evaluate competencies and not only contents. Quizzes are also used as an effective tool to improve learning and overcome incorrect beliefs.

fc031513ad0e3c0c9ae55fa862961b64277a9802	the increased use of tablets in education: why physical learning is sometimes better		Digital devices are becoming ubiquitous fixtures in classrooms nationwide. Despite this, the costs and benefits of digitization are understudied. For example, Mangen et al. (2013) found advantages in reading with physical books compared to digital readers. The current study extends these findings to physical and digital versions of spatial puzzles. Participants completing a series of physical tangram puzzles were both faster and more accurate than those completing digital versions of identical puzzles on tablet computers. Those in the physical condition were also faster and less error-prone on a subsequent arithmetic test. These results suggest that the current trend of increased digitization in education may have far-reaching and unexpected implications that could compromise learning. Follow-up studies aim to identify the cognitive mechanisms that cause these differences. These findings can be used to develop a set of best practices for incorporating digital teaching tools in the classroom.	best practice;book;cognitive dimensions of notations;tablet computer;ubiquitous computing	Sara G.

We ethnographically investigate the distributed nature of knowledge as enacted between heterogeneous groups over the course of three elections in Denmark. We 1) identify fundamental characteristics of elections, 2) provide a comprehensive account of the distributed nature of knowledge in organizing and executing elections, and 3) point to new challenging areas for human-computer interaction (HCI) design supporting distributed collaborative knowledge practices. We found that organizational pattern of elections complicates the embodiment of nomadic knowledge, which is crucial for managing the effective organization of an election. Thus, one of the relevant design challenges is finding out how to support the timely distribution of large amounts of information, while still ensuring it is appropriately divided and delivered to various groups participating in planning and executing elections.	human–computer interaction;norm (social);organizing (structure)	Nina Boulus-Rødje;Pernille Bjørn	2015		10.1145/2702123.2702458	voting;knowledge management;management science;management;world wide web	HCI	-63.41146998809868	-39.04970520623356	42547

Recall experiments in a variety of domains have demonstrated that experts possess larger chunks of knowledge on meaningful tasks, while their performance falls to that of novices on non-meaningful tasks. Three experiments are reported, two recall and one construction, that were designed to provide information on programmers' (COBOL) knowledge structures. In the initial experiment, the chunking ability of computer programmers, as revealed by program recall, was less successful in predicting performance on a debugging task than were programmers' problem-solving processes. A second experiment sought to determine whether the lack of a match between programmers' chunks and the information structures in the program used for recall was responsible for the poor differentiation of programming skill afforded by the recall test. Although expert programmers recalled more than novice programmers, there were no qualitative differences in the types of structures the two groups recalled. A third experiment required expert programmers to construct a routine to accomplish a similar function to that of the program used for recall. The programmers constructed routines with diverse program structures. In general, the results show that both expert and novice programmers possess a wide variety of chunks of the kind incorporated into the recall program. It appears, however, that even professional programmers do not have well-formulated scripts for validation stored in long-term memory.	programmer	Iris Vessey	1987	International Journal of Man-Machine Studies	10.1016/S0020-7373(87)80044-5	knowledge base;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system	SE	-73.45667968954994	-50.030425853333476	42571

Traditional notions of literacy and interpretations of what it means to act as readers or literature teachers can be re-examined within this new configuration of literacy. Starting from a perspective of teachers-as-ethnographers, the authors of this article study how pre-service teachers describe their roles and opportunities to act in social media environments. They present a framework which charts an evolution toward an understanding of reading as social practice. The authors present an exploration of reading practices within the social reading environment Goodreads that was set up with 79 student-teachers. The participants collaboratively composed an autoethnographic document consisting of multiple discussion threads that detail their experiences and reflections on social reading practices.

To this end, this research utilizes the example of the color guard club at Chienkuo Technology University (CTU). First, the authors researched the characteristics needed to be a color guard member. Second, a series of tests for measuring these characteristics was designed. Third, the authors administered the tests to all the club members and recorded the results. Fourth, after the club members had received one year of training, the authors ran regression analysis by using data from the tests of those who successfully passed the training. From this, the authors obtained a regression model. The authors then ran logistic regression analysis and discriminant analysis on the test data of all initial color guard club members, including those who eventually passed the training and those who eventually withdrew, to establish screening norms. Last, using factor analysis, the authors found the latent factors. These factors, along with the screening norms, can serve as a foundation for future selection of color guard members. This process of selecting club members scientifically may be adopted by other clubs in order to match students and clubs most effectively. 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Promoting an understanding of complex systems is a difficult yet important component of scientific literacy (Sabelli, 2006). Through emergent processes and localized interactions, the behaviors of a system’s components affect its overall function (Jacobson & Wilensky, 2006). These interactions are often dynamic and invisible which make them difficult for learners to understand and presents challenges for teachers (Feltovich et al.,2001 Hmelo-Silver et al., 2007). The Structure-Behavior-Function (SBF) conceptual representation allows students to understand the relationships between the structures, behaviors, and functions of systems and to map SBF across multiple levels. In the science classroom, academic researchers have developed tools utilizing the SBF representation as a way to teach about multiple complex systems (Hmelo-Silver et al., 2007; Liu & HmeloSilver, 2009). Structures are defined as the components of a system, behaviors as the mechanisms or processes that occur within a system and functions as system outputs (Goel et al, 1996; 2009). We present a case study of a teacher who appropriated the SBF conceptual representation that was originally introduced by a team of researchers, to create tools to meet her curricular needs. The focus of the study is to understand how the teacher transferred the use of the SBF representation between two different curriculum units. Some of the common critiques against the classical approach of transfer have put the spotlight on questions related to the conditions that facilitate transfer, the context of instruction, and the pertinent cues that learners need to be able to identify that signal the application of appropriate problem solving strategies (Lave, 1988, Bransford et al., 2000; Mestre, 2003). The study looks at transfer under two alternate perspectives and the possible synergy between using multiple perspectives to study transfer. Our study considers transfer from both an actor oriented approach (Lobato, 2002, 2006) and a preparation for future learning perspective (Bransford & Schwartz, 1999) to investigate the teacher as learner applying knowledge in a new area. We look at the influence of previous activities and procedures adopted by a learner to construe similarities in new situations (Lobato, 2006). In particular our interest is in understanding how a teacher constructs the relationships and similarities between two systems; one provided by researchers and one designated by the teacher. Adopting an actor oriented perspective requires considering which connections the learners make, on what basis, and how and why those connections are productive (Lobato, 2002). Evidence for transfer from this perspective is found by scrutinizing a given activity for any indication of influence from previous activities. Additionally, we investigate how a greater understanding of SBF might have contributed to transfer from a preparation for future learning (PFL) perspective. This provides a framework for evaluating the quality of particular kinds of learning experiences (Bransford & Schwartz, 1999). The PFL perspective allows us to uncover strategies that have been adopted to interpret a new situation; “Interpretation of the situation invariably involves some use of a previous experience it cannot be reduced to a simple replication of that experience” (Broudy, 1977, p. 11). Integration of these two perspectives on transfer was crucial to understanding the importance of activities and experiences (from an actor oriented perspective) which prepare the learner to develop new concepts that, in this case, focuses on transfer between complex systems.

A total of 501 valid questionnaires (285 females and 216 males) from Taiwanese high school students and 15 interviewees from the students receiving awards were the subjects in this study. The findings show that females had a stronger participative intrinsic motivation, while males displayed a higher participative interpersonal motivation. Furthermore, female average scores were higher than the male ones on the comprehension tests. Even though the final results of the total scores for females were still higher than those of males, male scores for the interactivity tests were on average higher than those of females. The phenomena and implications behind the participative motivations are specifically discussed and explained.

The usage of a tele-operative controlled industrial bending process in lecture combines theoretical learning contents with practical experiences. Lecturers can make experiments in interaction with the students, who are able to assist in choosing the process values. The chosen and presented bending process is the incremental tube forming process that uses in contrast to many ordinary bending processes targeted the superposition of stresses. By superposing of stresses, in this process for example a tube bending and a tube spinning process, several fundamental process characteristics can be observed and integrated into lectures to visualize the theoretical fundamentals behind. Incremental tube forming combines the tube spinning process, which affects the diameter of the tube all along the tube and creates a compressive stress, and a bending process. The understanding of superposition of stresses and the process phenomena are ambitious, so that experimental experience is very useful. By using a tele-operative control, the experiment is location- and time-independent available for lecturers and students all over the world. They can interact with the process like stopping it, influencing it during the process or laying it up. The possibilities for a usage in learning environments are described and pointed out.	experience;experiment;television	Rickmer Meya;Tobias R.

In parallel, an increasing research interest has been devoted to studying new learning analytics tools able to summarize the content of large sets of learning documents. To bridge the gap between formative assessment tools and document summarization systems, this paper addresses the problem of recommending short summaries of large sets of learning documents based on the outcomes of multiple-choice tests. Specifically, it presents a new methodology for integrating formative assessment through mobile applications and summarization of learning documents in textual form. The content of the multiple-choice tests is exploited to drive the generation of document summaries tailored to specific topics. Furthermore, the outcomes of the tests are used to automatically recommend the generated summaries to learners based on their actual needs. As a case study, we performed an evaluation experience of students' progresses, which was conducted in the context of a university-level course. The achieved results show the applicability of the proposed methodology.	accessibility;algorithm;automatic summarization;correctness (computer science);document;experiment;image resolution;knowledge level;mobile app;mobile device;scalability	Luca Cagliero;Laura Farinetti;Elena Baralis	2017	2017 IEEE 41st Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)	10.1109/COMPSAC.2017.231	formative assessment;automatic summarization;knowledge level;computer science;data mining;multi-document summarization;learning analytics	Web+IR	-77.99328288112393	-42.938120033679134	43030

Our REU model combines fundamental research in computational sensing with a scholarly context that connects computer science with computational liberal arts. Students are intellectually stimulated to make sense of people's behaviors and cognitive processes with multimodal sensing hardware and software. In doing so, they explore the fundamental challenges found at the intersection of computing, the human experience, and scientific interrogation. The placement of the human experience at the core of the research theme enables an environment that stimulates and cultivates an innovative undergraduate research model. We highlight outcomes from the first year and discuss three emerging practices that are central to our REU framework: (1) team-based collaborative training; (2) transdisciplinary integration; and (3) systematic prioritization of inclusiveness. We also describe how these practices are incorporated into our overall undergraduate research framework and touch upon lessons learned from feedback collected.	commodore reu;computer science;focus group;intellect;interpreter (computing);multimodal interaction	Cecilia Ovesdotter Alm;Reynold Bailey	2017	2017 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)	10.1109/FIE.2017.8190553	knowledge management;sociology;software;cognition;social exclusion;prioritization;liberal arts education;undergraduate research	HCI	-68.11786677281964	-36.56070330174143	43042

The method presented enhances traditional heuristic evaluation to include the use context, comprehensive view of the system, and reveals missing functionality by using user scenarios and demonstrations. HED also quantifies the results in a comparable way. We present findings from a real-life validation of the method in a large-scale procurement project of a healthcare and social welfare information system. We analyze and compare the performance of HED to other usability evaluation methods used in procurement. Based on the analysis HED can be used to evaluate the level of usability of an IT system during procurement correctly, comprehensively and efficiently.	heuristic evaluation;information system;procurement;real life;scenario (computing);usability inspection	Mari Tyllinen;Johanna Kaipio;Tinja Lääveri;Marko H.

There are many potential benefits: teachers can reuse collaboratively prepared course materials; students can schedule their studies at their own convenience; and employees can participate in selected subunits for refreshers. Society might benefit from an overall increase in literacy—and perhaps even computer literacy. Online education inherits many of the advantages and disadvantages of textbooks and conventional teaching, but also introduces some of its own. People involved in course preparation quickly discover that creating high-quality teaching materials is labor intensive, and very challenging. To be successful, online instruction requires even more organization and forethought in creating courses than otherwise, since there may be only limited interactions with students, and it is difficult to anticipate all possible options. Thoughtful planning and carefully debugged instructions are essential to make the experience more fulfilling for the students. Furthermore, for many kinds of courses, online materials must be updated regularly to remain timely. There are major concerns regarding who owns the materials (some universities claim proprietary rights to all multimedia courseware), with high likelihood that materials will be purloined or emasculated. Some altru-ism is desirable in exactly the same sense that open-source software has become such an important driving force. Besides, peer review and ongoing collaborations among instructors could lead to continued improvement of public-domain course materials. Administrators might seek cost-saving measures in the common quest for easy answers, less-qualified instructors, mammoth-class sizes, and teaching materials prepared elsewhere. Loss of interactions among students and instructors is a serious potential risk, especially if the instructor does not realize that students aren't grasping what is being taught. This can be partially countered by including some live lectures or videoteleconferenced lectures, and requiring instructors and teaching assistants to be accessible on a regular basis, at least via email. Multicast course communications and judicious use of Web sites may be appropriate for dealing with an entire class. Inter-student contacts can be aided by chat rooms, with instructors hopefully trying to keep the discussions on target. Also, students can be required to work in pairs or teams on projects whose success is more or less self-evident. E-education may be better for older or more disciplined students, and for students who expect more than just being entertained. It is useful for stressing fundamentals as well as helping students …	chat room;debugging;email;interaction;internet;multicast;open-source software;planning	Peter G. Neumann	1998	Commun.

This is motivated by an awareness of how cultural applications, in our case interactive performances, raise ethical issues that may challenge established research ethics processes. We review research ethics, HCI's engagement with ethics and the ethics of theatrical performance. Following an approach grounded in Responsible Research Innovation, we present the findings from a workshop in which artists, curators, commissioners, and researchers explored ethical challenges revealed by four case studies. We identify six ethical challenges for HCI's engagement with cultural applications: transgression, boundaries, consent, withdrawal, data, and integrity. We discuss two broader implications of these: managing tensions between multiple overlapping ethical frames; and the importance of managing ethical challenges during and after an experience as well as beforehand. Finally, we discuss how our findings extend previous discussions of Value Sensitive Design in HCI.	awareness;human–computer interaction;performance;value sensitive design	Steve Benford;Chris Greenhalgh;Bob Anderson;Rachel Jacobs;Michael Golembewski;Marina Jirotka;Bernd Carsten Stahl;Job Timmermans;Gabriella Giannachi;Matt Adams;Ju Row-Farr;Nick Tandavanitj;Kirsty Jennings	2015	ACM Trans.

One such method, Hint Factory, builds an interaction network out of observed player traces. This data structure is used to select the most appropriate next step from any previously observed state, which can then be used to provide guidance to future players. However, this method has previously been employed in systems in which each action a player may take requires roughly similar effort; that is, the“step cost” is constant no matter what action is taken. We hope to apply similar methods to an interaction network built from player traces in our game, BOTS; However, each edge can represent a varied amount of effort on the part of the student. Therefore, a different hint selection policy may be needed. In this paper, we discuss the problems with our current hint policy, assuming all edges are the same cost. Then, we discuss potential alternative hint selection policies we have considered.	data structure;digital footprint;interaction network;tracing (software)	Andrew Hicks;Yihuan Dong;Rui Zhi;Veronica Cateté;Tiffany Barnes	2015			strategy;interaction network;data structure;computer science;distributed computing	AI	-66.38196461311577	-41.27473862257704	43227

After completing a learning session with the tutor, student emotions were judged by the students themselves (self-judgments), untrained peers, and trained judges. Transcripts from the tutorial dialogues were analyzed with four methods that included 1) identifying direct expressions of affect, 2) aligning the semantic content of student responses to affective terms, 3) identifying psychological and linguistic terms that are predictive of affect, and 4) assessing cohesion relationships that might reveal student affect. Models constructed by regressing the proportional occurrence of each emotion on textual features derived from these methods yielded large effects (R2 = 38%) for the psychological, linguistic, and cohesion-based methods, but not the direct expression and semantic alignment methods. We discuss the theoretical, methodological, and applied implications of our findings toward text-based emotion detection during tutoring.	cohesion (computer science);emotion recognition;interaction;text-based (computing)	Sidney K.

Women believe that they are under-represented in the ICT sector and there is a genderbased gap in both ICT professionals and new occupations associated with new communication technologies. The problem of under-representation of women in the ICT sector, highlights the need for design and implementation of actions which will enable the female population in training and participation in entrepreneurship and employment with focus on ICT.

In complex application domains as for instance the eHealth domain, this issue of users’ content understanding is sometimes crucial, and thus should be carefully evaluated. Unfortunately, conventional usability evaluation techniques do not address challenges of content understanding.

64d8c717351263ce3a70d17295dc27e080c67070	a consolidated view of context for intelligent systems		This paper’s main objective is to consolidate the knowledge on context in the realm of intelligent systems, systems that are aware of their context and can adapt their behavior accordingly. We provide an overview and analysis of 36 context models that are heterogeneous and scattered throughout multiple fields of research. In our analysis, we identify five shared context categories: social context, location, time, physical context, and user context. In addition, we compare the context models with the context elements considered in the discourse on intelligent systems and find that the models do not properly represent the identified set of 3,741 unique context elements. As a result, we propose a consolidation of the findings from the 36 context models and the 3,741 unique context elements. The analysis reveals that there is a long tail of context categories that are considered only sporadically in context models. However, particularly these context elements in the long tail may be necessary for improving intelligent systems’ context awareness.	artificial intelligence;context awareness;long tail;semiconductor consolidation	Christine Bauer;Alexander Novotny	2017	JAISE	10.3233/AIS-170445	social environment;long tail;physical context;realm;computer science;intelligent decision support system;context model;knowledge management;context awareness	HCI	-64.78584478786154	-32.567108998628655	43681

Universities attempt to motivate learners (students) to support their peers to enhance the quality of learning outcomes. This study monitors how an ICTSS (ICT-based Support System) facilitates peer interaction in the Bachelor's and Master's thesis process. The aim of the study was to investigate learners' perception of usefulness of an ICTSS for peer interaction and the influencing factors on the quality of the peer interaction. The ICTSS was developed at the Department of Computer and Systems Sciences (DSV), at Stockholm University. The system facilitates peer interaction in three ways: peer reviews, active participation, and final opposition. The study employed a mixed-method approach, which included an online survey followed by in-depth interviews. The target groups were learners at the Bachelor's and Master's level in computer science and information systems. The findings showed that learners perceived the peer interaction useful to enhance the quality of the thesis outcomes. However, there are influencing factors affecting the quality of peer interaction, in different phases of the thesis process. Examples of these factors are the quality of thesis manuscripts, supervisors' control and grading, clear instructions and guidelines, learners' understanding of the peer interaction and why it takes place, previous training, and learners' motivation to perform peer reviews. Following these factors, the study developed a set of strategic suggestions from both pedagogical and technical aspects to enhance the peer interaction in the thesis process. Considering these suggestions makes the use of the ICTSS more effective to enhance the quality of thesis learning outcomes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In the educational area, the recommendation of relevant and interesting content can attract the student’s attention, motivating her/him during the learning-teaching process. It is very important, thus, to know learner preferences to suggest suitable contents to the students. The goal of this work is to present an approach to design the student interaction based on the recommendation of e-learning content, determining a more suitable relationship between learning objects and learning profiles. In our proposal, the learning profile is split into categories to attend different student preferences during the teaching-learning process: perception, presentation-format and participation. Our recommendation uses these categories to filter out the most suitable learning objects organized according to the IEEE LOM standard. We present a prototype architecture named e-LORS, over which we perform demonstrative experiments.	experiment;prototype;recommender system	Luciana A. M.

They describe activities that can be undertaken by learners. However, the literature is actually not explicit about how these terms can be defined; whether they are distinct; and whether they refer to overt manifestations, learning processes, or learning outcomes. Thus, a framework is provided here that offers a way to differentiate active, constructive, and interactive in terms of observable overt activities and underlying learning processes. The framework generates a testable hypothesis for learning: that interactive activities are most likely to be better than constructive activities, which in turn might be better than active activities, which are better than being passive. Studies from the literature are cited to provide evidence in support of this hypothesis. Moreover, postulating underlying learning processes allows us to interpret evidence in the literature more accurately. Specifying distinct overt activities for active, constructive, and interactive also offers suggestions for how learning activities can be coded and how each kind of activity might be elicited.	interactivity;observable;science	Michelene T.

This activity utilizes TwitterTrails, a visual tool to analyze Twitter claims, events, and memes. This tool provides views such as a propagation graph of a story's bursting activity, and the co-ReTweeted network of the more prominent members of the audience. Using a response and reflection form, students are guided through these different facets of a story. The classroom activity was iteratively designed over the course of three semesters. Here, we present the learning outcomes from our final semester's evaluation with 43 students. Our findings demonstrate that the activity provided students with both the conceptual tools and motivation to investigate the reliability of stories in social media. Our contribution also includes access to the tool and materials to conduct this activity. We hope that other educators will further improve and run this activity with their own students.	meme;social media;software propagation	Christina Pollalis;Catherine Grevet;Lauren Westendorf;Samantha Finn;Orit Shaer;Panagiotis Takis Metaxas	2018		10.1145/3170427.3174355	multimedia;fake news;computer science;misinformation;social media;graph	HCI	-73.04938378213171	-41.53980380936372	44064

In this study, we investigate the relationship between cultural capital, techno-capital and networking skills among college students. Based on a survey of a sample of college students, we identify that socialization into various cultural genres in an early age equips individuals with the cultural knowledge, attitude, and disposition to network skillfully. Second, we find that digital competency can contribute to networking skills. In particular, digital cultural production, in other words, actively engaging in creative online expression of one's cultural taste, is positively related to greater networking skills. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

The interaction effect between type of instruction and agent nonverbal behavior (deictic gestures and facial expression) was also investigated. A total of 236 college students learned from an animated pedagogical agent that varied by two factors: deictic gestures and facial expression within one of two instructional environments: one training them to perform tasks within a software program (procedural learning outcome); the other focusing on changing their beliefs regarding intellectual property (attitudinal learning outcome). Results indicated that the main effects of agent facial expression and gesture as well as the interaction were significant for agent perception and learning. With regard to learning, for attitudinal instruction, participants learned more when the agent’s facial expression was present but deictic gesture was absent; however, for procedural instruction, students learned more when the agent’s gestures were present. These results are discussed in light of a preliminary pedagogical agent design principle that suggests that it is most desirable to employ the one nonverbal communicative behavior that is most appropriate to the learning outcome. 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Students' written work and oral presentations are reviewed, using developed rubrics. In general, students gained engineer experiences and skills in analyzing a hydroelectric system. However, uneven learning outcomes are observed. Students who embraced the learning opportunity and learned to articulate problem spaces displayed positive learning outcomes beyond expectations. Instructional interventions are necessary to support students who are not able to break boundaries imposed by accustomed traditional approaches.	applied engineering;cognition;experience;interaction;nonlinear gameplay;problem solving;taxonomy (general)	Jia-Ling Lin;Paul Imbertson;Kundan Srivastav;William Horn	2016	2016 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)	10.1109/FIE.2016.7757546	simulation;engineering;knowledge management;management science	AI	-77.86101199124367	-36.44815649727712	44240

The paper starts with a review of learning and memory in order to extract key concepts needed for the analysis. Memory concepts extracted centered on the concept of analogy or metaphor and of memory optimizing constructs such as scripts and templates. The processes of assimilation and appropriation were learning concepts retrieved. Second, the overlap between action research and PBL was used to derive an action research cycle for PBL. Next, the cycle's viability was demonstrated by mapping an actual PBL activity to the new cycle. Finally, the paper positions PBL and more specifically, the research cycle for PBL, in light of the ongoing changes in the general business school environment. In total, the paper presents a model for using and justifying PBL in business curricula.	data assimilation;interface metaphor;scripting language	Wm. Benjamin Martz;Morgan M.

This process enables a Tangible User Interface (TUI) design that involves potential users and other stakeholders with or without technical background. The studio participants will play the role of a user group they all can relate to: business travelers. Based on the users' expert knowledge that we will collect during the research and exploration phase, they will form ideas and visualize TUI concepts that can enrich a business trip experience. During the session, participants will apply eight hands-on methods. These derive from the PD approach that we introduce in the studio. In a reflection round, we will discuss the co-creation process and resulting concepts, and provide advice for transferring the methods learned to their own projects.	hands-on computing;tangible user interface	Marie Beuthel;Anne Wohlauf	2017		10.1145/3024969.3025052	human–computer interaction;engineering;knowledge management;multimedia	HCI	-62.89479368448683	-38.46173640782258	44358

Although general-purpose searching such as one provided by Google is powerful, searching mechanism for specific purposes could rely on metadata. In distance learning (or e-learning), SCORM provides an efficient metadata definition for learning objects to be searched and shared. To facilitate searching in a federated repository, CORDRA provides a common architecture for discovering and sharing Learning Objects. We followed SCORM and CORDRA specifications to develop a registry system, called the MINE Registry, for storing and sharing 20,738 Learning Objects created in the past five years. As a contribution, we propose the concept of “Reusability Tree” to represent the relationships among relevant Learning Objects and enhance CORDRA. We further collect relevant information, while users are utilizing Learning Objects, such as citations and time period persisted. The feedbacks from the user community are also considered as critical elements for evaluating significance degree of Learning Objects. Through theses factors, we propose a mechanism to weight and rank Learning Objects in the MINE Registry, in addition to other external learning objects repositories.

To do so, it is suitable to use both TeX and Computer Algebra System (CAS). Nevertheless, the graphic output of CAS is not suited to the TeX document of the material. To improve it, since 2006, the authors have been developing KETpic as a plug-in based on CAS. The use of both TeX and KETpic based on CAS enables teachers to produce their original class materials with accurate and impressive figures. They wish not only to produce their original class materials with figures but also to use the class materials with figures produced by the others. To realize that objective, a good KETpic programming style is needed. For example, when educators produce a figure along with their material by KETpic, they wish to perform symbolic thinking, i.e. they create a KETpic program in a mathematical drawing procedure and concentrate their energy on qualitative improvement of the figures while they recognize the global image of the figure. Symbolic thinking is a factor in good elements of KETpic programming style. The authors investigated other good elements of KETpic programming style using a documentation approach, which is the method of checking teachers' records in detail for their improvement. In this paper, the authors present four good elements of the KETpic programming style.	coefficient;computer algebra system;documentation;local variable;plug-in (computing);programming language;scilab;the elements of programming style	Satoshi Yamashita;Hisashi Usui;Kiyoshi Kitahara;Setsuo Takato	2013	2013 13th International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications	10.1109/ICCSA.2013.20	education;computer science;graphics;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;cas registry number;machine learning;database;mathematics;multimedia;visual programming language;programming language;algorithm	Robotics	-84.65701072696062	-38.09281521795624	44502

The system is to provide something interesting or useful for everyone. The access to the system must be transparent, i.e. all applications have web interface. Apart from around 15 thousand students (who use the system at least occasionally), IS MU has to serve several thousands of staff members (access the system on a regular basis) as well as people from the registrar departments and management (50-100 people, massive usage). IS MU operates from March 1999. In December 2000, the number of accesses reached 20 millions. During the last semester (Autumn 2000), university could fully exploit the features of IS MU. The number of accesses was over 180 thousand per day. – Everybody is responsible for keeping their data up-to-date. Everyone has access to all available public information (IS MU obviously respects the Data Protection Act). The system is there for everyone, not merely for a few admin people or managers.	algorithm;applet;authorization;conditional (computer programming);data protection act 1998;data protection act, 2012;emoticon;exploit (computer security);graphics;privacy;smoothing;spreadsheet;user interface;world wide web	Michal Brandejs;Iva Hollanová;Mirka Misáková;Jan Pazdziora	2001			engineering management;engineering;knowledge management;data science	HCI	-68.47566551538813	-25.262345734751275	44545
fa38e6b4cf874e7da383c58d35ace862761e3ae7	from wooden blocks and lego to minecraft: designing and playing with blocks to learn in a 3d virtual world		Minecraft, a virtual 3D world game to fight nighttime monsters and a design environment for building shelters, strikes a balance between “want to” and “have to” participate, that is, students “want to” use it (self-directed learning) and educators can impose constraints by knowledge (curriculumdriven learning). These two goals often seen as contradictory are reconciled by taking advantage of the unlimited number of opportunities block building and role-playing provide, and treating learning as a constrained-based design process. We are in the midst of organizing a pilot study of using Minecraft in a university course in education. We are interested in understanding Minecraft’s capacity to engage students in learning and we conjecture there is a connection between building and playing in Minecraft and developing knowledge and skills. We survey related work and use a theoretical framework to guide our efforts. Our findings are preliminary with open issues for further research.	minecraft;organizing (structure);virtual reality;virtual world	Anders I.

The need to keep track of the knowledge acquired this way is increasing as its sources diversity also increases. This work presents the pilots trials on the use of a tool developed to help keeping track of the learners’ informal learning, within a number of companies spread out in three countries. This tool developed through the European Commission funded project TRAILER, is still under development, which will allow integrating the set of improving suggestions obtained from users during the piloting phase. The overall idea of managing one’s informal learning was well accepted and welcomed, which validated the emerging need for a tool with this purpose.	awareness;trailer (computing)	Arcelina Marques;Maria Clara Viegas;Gustavo Ribeiro Alves;Valentina Zangrando;Nikolas Galanis;José Janssen;Elwira Waszkiewicz;Miguel Ángel Conde González;Francisco J.

Several of these systems offer capabilities for people to create profiles of themselves and algorithms for matching profiles to recommend one person to another. When a group of people is gathered together in a physical space, for the purpose of renewing connections or creating new ones, new challenges emerge with respect to which dimensions of people's online representations to inject into that space - how, where and when to recommend whom to whom. This paper briefly describes some experiences and ongoing challenges encountered in determining how best to bridge the gaps between people by bridging the gaps between people's online representations of themselves and their presence in physical space.	algorithm;bridging (networking);experience;interaction	Joseph F.

The information required almost always cuts across computer applications and files of several functional areas. In the majority of the installations, the EDP manager is forced to flatly turn down the manager's request. He either cannot respond because the needed data is hopelessly locked up in existing poorly documented computer files, or because responding would throw the normal computer processing into upheaval.	computer file;electronic data processing	Richard L.

In order to address data sparseness problem, a robust Ridge Regression algorithm is designed to estimate model parameters.

It explores the affordances of writing and reading on paper and those of writing on a keyboard and reading on a screen. The analysis is based on an exploratory study carried out with a class of Masters Students in Multimedia Communication and Technologies of Information at the University of Udine (Italy) who were asked to write an essay on this topic. The methodology applied in this study is qualitative content analysis of the essays produced by the students. The principal results of this study show that reading and writing competencies are changing with the use of digital technologies but that paper and digital interactions are not mutually exclusive. Students are more productive textually with writing than with reading, however, they still see the virtues of writing on paper which they continue to use extensively. It appears that chirographic writing and paper is more multi-sensorial and meta-communicative than using the keyboard or screen. Further research is recommended to explore this complementarities of writing on paper and on screen/keyboard as well as the perceived changes in preferred sources of reading material.

0d903d876cdda507a9687a32ae0657d82f80ac30	detecting person heterogeneity in a large-scale orthographic test using item response models		Achievement tests for students are constructed with the aim of measuring a specific competency uniformly for all examinees. This requires students to work on the items in a homogenous way. The dichotomous logistic Rasch model is the model of choice for assessing these assumptions during test construction. However, it is also possible that various subgroups of the population either apply different strategies for solving the items or make specific types of mistakes, or that different items measure different latent traits. These assumptions can be evaluated with extensions of the Rasch model or other Item Response models. In this paper, the test construction of a new large-scale German orthographic test for eighth grade students is presented. In the process of test construction and calibration, a pilot version was administered to 3,227 students in Austria. In the first step of analysis, items yielded a poor model fit to the dichotomous logistic Rasch model. Further analyses found homogenous subgroups in the sample which are characterized by different orthographic error patterns.	item response theory;orthographic projection;sensor	Christine Hohensinn;Klaus D.

As a general answer to that fact, all the universities are adapting their engineering curricula to that demand creating new subjects in renewable energy (RE) technology; those new subjects needs new education tools and this motivate the investigation and creation of software simulation environment specific for those technologies with the goal of engineering education. In the present work it is shown a multi-platform software architecture specially designed for distance learning and with the target to be a complementary tool to the curricula contents of the new subjects in RE engineering with the aim to offer a virtual laboratory able to simulate the most updated energy harnessing systems.

We use data collected from students in an introductory Java course to assess the value of this approach. We compare the approach that utilizes the number of attempts to an approach that simply considers whether or not a student produced a correct solution to each exercise. We found that the results for the method that utilizes the number of attempts correlates better with performance on a final exam.	final exam;java	Alireza Ahadi;Raymond Lister;Arto Vihavainen	2016		10.1145/2899415.2899452	programming;simulation;computer science;data science;multimedia;management;pedagogy	AI	-78.92038332604847	-39.87460896460061	45225

The authors worked with the power plant executives throughout the project period, which lasted over two years. Five alternatives were considered, with costs ranging from $1.1 to $2.3 million. The innovative and unique features of the instructional material are the following: (a) During the project period, the authors made several visits to the power plant and recorded important segments of the decision-making process as they occurred. This process requires the students to consider economic, financial, management, information systems, technology, and engineering issues in analyzing the problem. The discussions were video taped and included in the multi-media CD-ROM to bring the problem to life in the classroom. (b) Incorporation of the Expert Choice software in the CD-ROM provides the students with an opportunity to analyze the power plant problem in a realistic way and compare their solutions to the one the company eventually selected. (c) The actual plant manager discusses the problem and provides the assignment to the student using videos, thereby encouraging them to become more deeply engaged in their roles as engineers and managers and improve their teamwork and decision-making skills. (d) The effectiveness of the instructional materials was tested with different groups of students at several universities using summative and formative evaluation methods. This multimedia case study has now been used by about 2,600 business and engineering students. The results show that the students were excited by the assignment, finding the case study to be a realistic, real-world problem replete with open-ended possibilities and multiple solutions.	cd-rom;emoticon;management information system;nonlinear gameplay;video	Chetan S.

6c8eaed4f0fcdc80fed6e18131b4afbd104f28a2	chamilo 2.0: a second generation open source e-learning and collaboration platform	life long learning	Dokeos used to be one of the leading open source learning platforms. It is well known for the wide range of functions it offers and especially for its ease of use. In many ways it is however a typical first generation learning management system (LMS) consisting of a set of loosely integrated tools. The original design of this LMS has a number of serious drawbacks and limitations. Because of this it was decided to opt for a completely new system that would use state of the art development techniques. The presentation will go into various aspects of the new system called Chamilo, dealing with some broad technical aspects, such as the architecture, but mainly concentrating on the benefits for users. The new version is built on a repository of reusable simple and complex content objects, not only documents. The web LCMS is only one of the possible applications that run on that repository. One of the other applications that can make use of the same set of objects is the portfolio. Functions that used to be modules within a course can also simply be used as applications, e.g. forum, assessment, wiki. All functions such as creating, changing, editing and deleting an object are basically the same platform wide. As a result all modules and applications interact in a far more consistent and less bug prone way. This also greatly simplifies the user interface. This interface that is common to all objects in all tools and modules, makes a number of publication features available that were not available in all tools before, such as categorization, selection of target groups or users, visibility and period of publication. This is certainly adding to Chamilo’s ambition to be a user friendly, flexible, fast and consistent platform.

But most guidelines fall short of the goal to put the accumulated knowledge of user-centered design at the fingertips of everyday developers, often becoming a static document read only by human factors specialists. This paper describes a process and technology designed to turn usability guidelines into a proactive development resource that can be applied throughout the development process. The process ensures conformance with established guidelines, but has the flexibility to meet the diverse needs of user interface design requirements, and use project experiences to evolve the guidelines to meet the dynamic needs of organizations. Case-based and organizational learning technology is used to support this process and integrates emerging interface design experiences with established guidelines to create a context-specific body of knowledge about usability practices.	conformance testing;human factors and ergonomics;requirement;usability;user interface design;user-centered design	Scott Henninger;Charisse Lu;Candace Faith	1997		10.1145/263552.263594	user interface design;usability goals;pluralistic walkthrough;web usability;user;design;user experience design;organizational learning;computer user satisfaction;usability;web design;human–computer interaction;agile usability engineering;computer science;systems engineering;knowledge management;body of knowledge;usability engineering;design education;user interface;heuristic evaluation;usability lab;usability inspection	HCI	-63.06232566956202	-45.131048640148094	45463

The record annual growth for MOOCs has made many respected institutions reconsider their educational strategies. Many elite universities have started to join the stream; others are expected to join very soon. In this paper we will focus on select MOOC providers that will help institutions or individual instructors ride the stream before it is too late. All MOOC providers have been carefully selected to meet the author’s criteria of either having crossed a capacity range limit or being tailored to meet the Arabian Gulf region needs. Finally, the paper summarizes the best practices and gives recommendations for any Gulf region institution or individual for better implementation of MOOCs into their learning system.	best practice;gulf of execution;massive open online course;small private online course	A.

TAG is a competence model of command language organization which emphasizes the structural organization of the command language. That is, a group of commands all with the same form but differing values is predicted to be easier to use than one where each command of the group has a unique pattern of values. From the first, Payne and Green (1983, 1984) two level organization of TAG. The four test command languages they used were: “structure and mnemonics”; “structure only”; “mnemonics only”; and a version of the EMACS editor command language. The subject's recall performance for any of the first three languages was better than for the fourth. The original experiment was replicated at the University of Waterloo to gain a better view of user's capabilities for command language usage. At Waterloo a fifth language was added to the testing, “neither structure nor mnemonics” to complete the 2×2 block design. Contrary to the original results,  n  the replication, the structural factor was not a significant factor. In fact, the structure only language, the EMACS variant and the language with neither structure nor mnemonics were not significantly different. Considering only the languages with structure, the use of word abbreviation as mnemonic appears to be more effective than the use of graphical symbols.  As TAG depends on the explanation of the importance of structure, this finding raises questions as to its utility. A categorization exercise given to the Waterloo subjects gave the only result which showed any influence of the structure factor. If TAG does provide a performance model of command languages, it appears to have much less influence on the user's performance than some types of mnemonics.  The EMACS variant has more complex organization than any other of the test languages. The test results do not show that the subjects were able to use the clues provided. Payne and Green (1984, 1986), Carroll (1982) and Dixon (1987) have suggested possible explanations for this poor recall, but the current work leaves the question unresolved.	mnemonics (keyboard)	Mert Cramer	1990	International Journal of Man-Machine Studies	10.1016/S0020-7373(05)80109-9	natural language processing;cognition;human–computer interaction;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;user interface	Arch	-72.05280835229907	-50.97475161791928	45676
3500d0292f98c500c4dbbce50dd466e6e49e8952	visual progression analysis of student records data		University curriculum, both on a campus level and on a per-major level, are affected in a complex way by many decisions of many administrators and faculty over time. As universities across the United States share an urgency to significantly improve student success and success retention, there is a pressing need to better understand how the student population is progressing through the curriculum, and how to provide better supporting infrastructure and refine the curriculum for the purpose of improving student outcomes. This work has developed a visual knowledge discovery system called eCamp that pulls together a variety of population-scale data products, including student grades, major descriptions, and graduation records. These datasets were previously disconnected and only available to and maintained by independent campus offices. The framework models and analyzes the multi-level relationships hidden within these data products, and visualizes the student flow patterns through individual majors as well as through a hierarchy of majors. These results support analytical tasks involving student outcomes, student retention, and curriculum design. It is shown how eCamp has revealed student progression information that was previously unavailable.		Mohammad Raji;John Duggan;Blaise DeCotes;Jian Huang;Bradley T.

In the context of a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), assessing these experiments manually by teaching assistants is not possible owed to the high number of participants and the resulting workload for the teaching team. Systems for machine-based assessment of coding tasks are existing, but not necessarily available publicly, or not prepared to handle the massive amount of users in a MOOC. Definitely, they are not available “ad hoc”, but require a certain amount of effort to be integrated in the MOOC platform or to be made available for the students in another way. Time and money to provide the required effort is not always available. This work presents a lightweight solution for the assessment of practical programming exercises, based on third party online coding tools. The solution was introduced as a part of openHPI's Web-Technologies course. The basic idea is to prepare a task in an available online tool, along with a piece of code that is able to evaluate the participant's solution. In case of success the participant is provided with a password, which in return serves as the answer for a fill-in-the-gap question in a standard quiz as provided by the openHPI MOOC platform, and thus allows for automatic online assessment based on practical coding exercises.	experiment;hands-on computing;hoc (programming language);massive open online course;money;password;positive feedback;openhpi	Thomas Staubitz;Jan Renz;Christian Willems;Johannes Jasper;Christoph Meinel	2014	2014 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON)	10.1109/EDUCON.2014.6826135	simulation;computer science;online assessment;multimedia;world wide web	SE	-82.80982606837303	-39.53549481716316	45757

Software Engineering is a very complex theme requiring various technical and nontechnical skills. At the beginning of a research project we asked which competencies our graduates need in their everyday working life. In this paper the course survey of graduates is described to gain information about necessary expert and interdisciplinary competencies. First of all, the conceptual approach and the research goals are explained. In a second step the research design in detail will be illustrated. Afterwards analyses take place considering this survey in order to get information concerning competencies and to evaluate the course retrospectively considering this expertise. Furthermore it is required to determine whether improvements or deteriorations in chronological sequence through the semesters can be detected. The students' attitude towards this course is not that positive, so also the survey includes this bias. But, as the learning and teaching arrangement shall be designed more attractive for students as well, first their evaluation has to be analysed. The last chapter provides a summary and an outlook how the results of this survey will be used to improve the quality of teaching. All of this combined is intended to contribute towards the development of a Competency Profile and in a wider context to reach the top goal of the project, to obtain recommendations for teaching and learning methods to improve the quality of teaching.	microsoft outlook for mac;software engineering	Carolin Gold;Jörg Abke;Yvonne Sedelmaier	2014	2014 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON)	10.1109/EDUCON.2014.6826075	engineering management;engineering;knowledge management;pedagogy	SE	-78.06371650066976	-34.999625027980485	45838

The main objective of the PDS is to deepen the student teachers' involvement in the school, to expose them to the variety of teacher work tasks, and to provide them with a wide range of experiences. This paper focuses on the development and implementation of a computer science (CS) student teacher practicum program that takes place within the PDS framework. We present the significant advantages that can be gained using PDS principles and demonstrate different activities performed in order to gain them within the training of CS student teachers. The paper reflects the accumulative knowledge acquired over the past five year at the Beit Berl College, Israel. We believe that this paper will contribute to the community of CS teacher preparation educators.	computer science	Noa Ragonis;Anat Oster-Levinz	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-24722-4_10	mathematics education;medical education;engineering;pedagogy	Logic	-78.39259190008136	-34.4701302090786	45908

However, its underlying principles and functionality are not well understood, which has resulted in an inconsistency in practice. This study identifies the underlying constructs of WebQuests as perceived by teachers and variables affecting their perceptions on WebQuests. A survey was conducted on teachers (n = 226) recruited from one large research university in the USA and a professional listserv. The findings reveal three constructs perceived by teachers as critical to WebQuests: constructivist problem solving, social interaction and scaffolded learning. Results also show that variables like purpose of WebQuest use, years of teaching, years of WebQuest use and gender predict, at various degrees, teachers’ perceptions on WebQuests. Discussions are made on how the constructs identified can be used to improve online teaching and learning. Suggestions for future study are included by examining the influences of social, psychological and affective factors on learners’ learning in WebQuests.	problem solving;webquest	Robert Z.

We have developed a new publicly available media-enhanced approach for teaching modeling and simulation, designated as TrafficJam. The approach consists of two core activities, both of which involve students optimizing traffic signals (also known as traffic lights, or stoplights). TrafficJam is likely best distinguished from other classroom simulation exercises in that these activities are introduced, motivated, and demonstrated in a video created by Twin Cities Public Television (TPT). The video uses an inquiry-driven format to feature four high school students who take on the task of improving signal timing in their own neighborhood. A pilot study of TrafficJam in four schools indicates that students find the video engaging, the activities relevant and interesting, and that they gain understanding of modeling and simulation from the experience.	ap computer science principles;simulation	David Musicant;S.

Studies have indicated boredom as one sign of a poor engagement in a classroom. For example, students who are bored may apply less effort and stop paying attention to their lecturer over time. Such students ultimately end up getting poor academic results, involving in many disciplinary actions and at risk of dropping out. However, many researchers study the problem of poor engagement in classrooms using traditional methods such as the questionnaire survey and setting up experiments that consume considerable time, effort and with very limited settings. Consequently, in this paper, we present our work-in-progress that addresses the problem. We propose a conceptual emotion-based student engagement model that is animated by an agent-based social simulator. The preliminary theory of this proposal is based on three main elements in a classroom; the engagement level of students, the emotional state of a lecturer and the emotional states of students.	agent-based model;agent-based social simulation;co-ment;ella (programming language);experiment;linda (coordination language);low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy;multi-agent system;socio-cognitive;thomas j. watson research center	Latha Subramainan;Moamin A.

According to the results there were no statistically significant difference in terms of learning outcomes, total fixation time on relevant texts and images, fixation count on relevant texts and images, and mean fixation duration on relevant images between spatial and non-spatial group according to the research results. However, mean fixation duration on relevant texts was significantly higher for spatial group than non-spatial group. According to mean ranks on all measures of eye tracking data, there may be tendency that participants in spatial group spent more time and attention on relevant text as non-spatial group spent more time and attention on narration and relevant images.	eye tracking	Tugba Altan;Kursat Cagiltay	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-20609-7_1	contiguity;data collection;mann–whitney u test;animation;statistics;eye tracking;descriptive statistics;computer science	HCI	-73.94874702752352	-47.37940541702629	46121

Thirty students completed a multiple-choice pre-test, a 35-minute training session, and a multiple-choice post-test. After completing the post-test, students reviewed their tutorial interaction and judged what emotions they experienced on the basis of the dialogue history and their facial expressions. Our results revealed that many measures of performance were impervious to poor or modest speech recognition accuracy, which is compatible with a soft constraint-based model. Speech recognition errors had a very subtle impact on learning as well as participants' emotions and attitudes.	acoustic cryptanalysis;automated system recovery;constrained optimization;experiment;natural language processing;programming paradigm;sensor;speech recognition;text-based (computing)	Sidney K.

The project involves using ICTs to provide learner support and expand access to a print-based, correspondence style teacher education program (DTEP) that has been delivered by the National Institute for Education, Samste, since 1995. In January 2005 four modules were revised to include ICT support through the use of the Moodle open source learning management system. Later in 2005 the use of ICTs in this program will be evaluated to determine their effectiveness in terms of improving quality and access. This paper discusses the proposed research and some of the local issues that affect the implementation of this project.	open-source software	Mark Bullen;Sangay Jamtsho	2005	Fifth IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT'05)	10.1109/ICALT.2005.254	agriculture;knowledge management;multimedia;law;information technology;public domain software;pedagogy	Robotics	-77.5078823518377	-34.35761495744904	46208

This research begins with a thorough review of literature and other related works. It analyses them and extracts a number of conclusions regarding the reasons for the lack of specific Knowledge and Learning Technologies for mobile learning scenarios at higher education. Then, based on the trend of mobile computation and doing many activities in mobility, and the limitations encountered in the existing current teaching-learning processes, the dissertation proposes to create a new framework for mobile teaching-learning at higher education. Although some researchers offer a framework for theorizing about mobile learning, lecturers do not have yet a guideline about how to integrate mobile learning into their teaching more effectively.	computation;mobile device	Alex Rayón	2013			higher education;computation;mobile device;guideline;knowledge management;computer science	HCI	-71.71872769476491	-38.5911425262772	46248

These systems are being continually developed in medium and large sized companies to solve business, scientific and engineering problems over the Intranet. However, the benefits are limited to a few companies with a sufficiently large workforce and budget. If these systems can be designed to be available over the Internet, the benefits will reach even smaller sized companies. This paper addresses the design of such a system. Such a design should consider control, data, and user interface dimensions while integrating the different components. Also, this design requires the use of a diverse set of concepts such as network programming, security, and coordination.

What impact, if any, does technology-assisted education have on the future of higher education? In this study, we examine data from an ongoing evaluation of the distance education program for graduate level business students in a private university. The study addresses the impact of technology-assisted learning on academic performance among distance learners and their on-campus counterparts. The study further explores the relationship between academic performance and students' technological adeptability. The findings indicate, when adjusted for gender (females out-performed males), there were no significant differences in academic performance between distance learners and their on-campus counterparts. Analysis also shows no significant differences in overall academic performance between technology-adept students and those without technological skills. These findings may remove at least some perceived barriers in the decision to initiate distance education programs.	technological singularity	Cheryl King Duvall;Robert G.

The idea is that the objectives could be applied both to the course as a whole, either it is bachelor, master or doctor level of education, as well as to the separate activities of the learning process. Further testing of the course is based on the achievement of these objectives at the end of the course or completing the activities applying both quantitative and qualitative approach to the testing process.

5684957295185e1058ef30abcf5e3a1c9e376d1e	tasc: combining virtual reality with tangible and embodied interactions to support spatial cognition		A growing body of empirical evidence from the cognitive sciences shows that physical experience can enhance cognition in areas that involve spatial thinking. At the same time, virtual environments provide opportunities to engage learners with novel spatial tasks that cannot be achieved in the real world. Yet combining virtual worlds with tangible interfaces to engage spatial cognition is still not a well-explored area. This paper describes the TASC (Tangibles for Augmenting Spatial Cognition) system, which combines movement tracking and tangible objects in order to create a strong sense of embodiment in a virtual environment for spatial puzzle solving, designed to engage perspective taking ability. We describe the motivation, design process, and development of TASC. We also report the results from our user study, showing the participants' positive experiences, linking to future research opportunities.	cognition;cognitive science;experience;interaction;usability testing;virtual reality;virtual world	Jack Shen-Kuen Chang;Georgina Yeboah;Alison Doucette;Paul Clifton;Michael Nitsche;Tim Welsh;Ali Mazalek	2017		10.1145/3064663.3064675	spatial memory;spatial cognition;human–computer interaction;engineering;metaverse;virtual machine;embodied cognition;empirical evidence;virtual reality;cognition	HCI	-63.39341598484283	-41.2688145940403	46637

Referring to such findings from literature our research aims at exploring dependencies between e-learning usage patterns and achieved learning results on the basis of LMS log-files from courses in different knowledge domains, and by analyzing courses not in isolation but by taking potential dependencies with students' activities in other courses into account. We examine correlations between usage variables and the students' performance in three blended learning courses with different topics based on large cohorts of students (n=883, n=389, n=578). In this context, an extended set of variables, including LMS usage beyond the three courses and usage patterns of students, are examined for interdependencies. Our results indicate that specific indicators, such as the number of active learning days and topic views, have a positive influence on learning results. In general, they show that at-risk students can be differentiated from well-performing students by their usage behavior. Moreover, we try to identify some significant patterns of LMS usage amongst the students. The paper shows how these patterns differ in our observations depending on the course domains.	active learning (machine learning);interdependence;management system	Felix Mödritscher;Monika Andergassen;Gustaf Neumann	2013		10.1145/2494188.2494206	computer science;data science;machine learning;multimedia	HCI	-76.3988713477486	-49.59531272736011	46729

We describe the use of a fuzzy linguistic summarisation LS technique for extracting linguistically interpretable rules from student data describing prominent relationships between activity/engagement characteristics and achieved performance. We propose an intelligent framework for monitoring individual or group performance during activity and problem-based learning tasks. The proposed system is developed as a set of services to cater for data heterogeneity and deployable on a cloud computing platform. We present a case study and experiments in which we apply the fuzzy LS technique for analysing the effectiveness of using a group performance model GPM to deploy activity led learning ALL in a master-level module.

However, students may not offer constructive feedback due to lack of expertise knowledge. Therefore, this study proposed a scaffolded assessment approach accordingly. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, the quasi-experimental design was employed to investigate the effects of scaffolded assessment for self-critiques and peer assessment on studentsu0027 learning effectiveness in the web-based assessment activities. A total of ninety 7th graders participated in the experiment, and divided into three groups with or without the scaffolding critique. The results show the use of the scaffolded assessment in the web-based peer assessment activities did not show a significant difference in the studentsu0027 learning effectiveness. Even though the results show that learning effectiveness of the participants in the two experimental groups is significantly enhanced, there is no significant effect of providing the scaffolded assessment on the participantsu0027 learning effectiveness in the three groups. In addition, the participants showed a positive learning attitude toward the web-based assessment activities and agreed that the activities could enhance the participantsu0027 interactions between the peers and instructor.	peer-to-peer	Chien-I Lee;Ya-Fei Yang;Shin-Yi Mai	2016	IJDET	10.4018/IJDET.2016100104	psychology;mathematics education;intervention;multimedia;peer feedback;law;pedagogy	HCI	-76.0732010093301	-41.968386001304296	46989

Educators, industry leaders, and government officials argue that the United States is falling behind other countries in technology innovation. And, most attribute this situation to ineffective education in the areas of math, science, and technology. The current study provides insight into these issues by linking math confidence, computer confidence, and CSE. Four hypotheses were tested using data gathered from undergraduate business students in a southern university. The results were significant, suggesting that both Math Confidence and Computer Confidence have a significant effect on CSE, both directly and indirectly. This study extends prior research on CSE by examining the link between Math Confidence and CSE and posits that technology educators may be well-served to consider some of the same techniques and methodologies applied in mathematics education to improve CSE in college students.

Such difficulty stems from the complexity of the abstract notions involved and the required mathematical background. Surveys conducted among our students showed that many of them were applying some theoretical concepts mechanically rather than developing a significant learning of them, leading to a lack of motivation and interest. To cope with this problem, we introduced a number of didactic strategies based on a constructivist approach. The main aim of the proposed strategies is to promote a more significant learning of several important FLAT topics.	automata theory;formal language	Carlos Iván Chesñevar;María Paula González;Ana Gabriela Maguitman	2004		10.1145/1007996.1008002	formal language;computer science;theoretical computer science;algorithm	AI	-80.46787653034671	-36.10353136986085	47005

This study aimed to assess whether students' attitudes towards Computer Science and their self-efficacy with programming changed after engaging with robotic activities. Findings show that after completing a 10-week period with the Arduino robotics environment, students' positive attitudes towards Computer Science increased along with feelings of coding self-efficacy. In other words, students report liking Computer Science more and report feeling that they are more able to learn programming. These findings imply that using physical computing activities within the right context could change student attitudes towards and self-efficacy in Computer Science.	arduino;computational thinking;computer science;physical computing;robot	Anastasios Theodoropoulos;Raúl Jiménez-Soto;Angeliki Antoniou;Giorgos Lepouras	2018		10.1145/3265757.3265770	pedagogy;coding (social sciences);mathematics education;arduino;self-efficacy;computer science;feeling;artificial intelligence;physical computing;robotics	AI	-71.53421880067236	-43.32197575968413	47048

Therefore, ITS are rare and often rather test systems in academic research than wide-spread tools in practical use. We show how computer algebra systems (CAS) like Maple (TM) or Mathematica (TM) can be used to reduce the development effort for parts of an ITS in engineering considerably. The built-in intelligence of CAS wrt. symbolic computation is exploited for implementing parts of the expert module and diagnostic capabilities for certain assignment types in engineering. This way, a tutored assignment environment can be easily written. As opposed to other approaches which implement so-called """"intelligent CAS"""" with explanatory components from scratch (cf. [Nisheva]), we use an existing CAS and enhance it didactically by implementing tutorial procedures. Note that we do not claim to provide a """"full-fledged"""" ITS including a student model. Since our learning material is not the only offering but just one part of the overall curriculum (including lectures), this restriction is not problematic. It is the main advantage of our approach, that a tutoring environment for periods of self-study can be implemented with low effort by an instructor in engineering, i.e. by the person who is responsible for making students use it. In order to facilitate this, we set up a sequence of guidelines on how to proceed when writing tutored assignment worksheets for certain classes of engineering problems (cf. [Alpers] for examples on stress analysis) and we implemented generic diagnostic procedures for one of the most frequently occurring underlying mathematical models, i.e. linear systems. These procedures can be used to find faults in linear systems of equations like missing or wrong equations which, for example, occur when students set up equations for equilibrium conditions in mechanics. Moreover, they also give information on certain kinds of errors like wrong symbols, sign errors, wrong terms, or missing terms which (according to [Gertner]) show up frequently. Future work will provide more generic procedures in order to further facilitate the implementation work of an instructor.

PurposernrnrnrnrnThis paper aims to investigate 152 pre-service and in-service school teachers’ perceptions toward Web 2.0 applications and their usage in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). A five-point Likert scale questionnaire was used. The data were analyzed quantitatively using descriptive statistics and independent sample t-tests. The descriptive statistics were used to identify teachers’ perceptions toward Web 2.0 applications and their usage. The t-test was used to investigate the differences in perceptions between groups due to gender, and experience using computers and the Internet. The results showed that teachers have high perception toward Web 2.0 tools and services, but the extent to which they use Web 2.0 applications is somehow moderate. Moreover, no statistically significant differences in perception toward Web 2.0 were detected due to gender or experience using computers and the internet. Recommendations and suggestions for improving Web 2.0 integration into teaching and learning are proposed.rnrnrnrnrnDesign/methodology/approachrnrnrnrnrnThis study adopted the quantitative research approach using a questionnaire for data collection. The questionnaire was designed to investigate teachers’ perceptions of using Web 2.0 applications as a method for teaching and learning purposes.rnrnrnrnrnFindingsrnrnrnrnrnThe results showed high self-perception of teachers toward Web 2.0 and their use for improving students’ performance, which can be attributed to their awareness of Web 2.0 importance and benefit in education. On the other hand, results indicated a low use of most of Web 2.0 tools such as microblogging, audio file sharing, photo sharing and content developing. Again, these findings can be attributed to the lack of professional training on using Web 2.0. In addition, the results did not show significant differences between male and female teachers in using Web 2.0 applications with the exception of two items. Neither did the results show any significant differences between teachers who are beginners in using computers and the internet and teachers who are advanced. This could be because beginner users of computers and the internet have the same motivation as the advances users pertaining to teaching.rnrnrnrnrnOriginality/valuernrnrnrnrnThere must be an extensive training for teachers on how to use Web 2.0 tools to enhance their teaching. Infrastructure for the internet should be available so that teachers can use Web 2.0 without worrying about the technology infrastructure at their schools. More research studies should be conducted regarding the use of Web 2.0 by teachers and students alike. A qualitative and quantitative method of data collection should be used when investigating different aspects of Web 2.0. A comparison between K-12 teachers and higher education faculty members should be conducted pertaining to the use of Web 2.0 for education. A comparison study between pre-service and in-service teachers should be conducted to investigate Web 2.0 tools for educational and personal purposes.	web 2.0	Wenbai Li;BA KatieJ.O’Conor	2018	Interact.

These are usually cases where a teacher analysed what was particularly weak in an existing situation and thought of how technology could be used to address that bottleneck. Often the technology is not particularly innovative, but it is a close match to the needs of that niche. This paper develops this argument by reference to a number of pieces of software which have little in common with each other, but all of which have proved to promote learning powerfully.	cal;niche blogging	Stephen W.

These real world implementations can be in physical classrooms, on-line courses, informal educational settings, as well as other learning environments. The innovations can include new ways of conceptualizing and presenting a domain, computerbased multimedia learning tools, and other innovations. The common thread though is that these innovations are beyond labtesting and are guided by principles and research from the cognitive and learning sciences. The governing board symposium will bring to the conference educational innovation found in different parts of the world (US, Asia, Europe) from distinguished researchers representing a variety of theoretical orientations and focusing on different aspects of the learning process (e.g., cognitive, social, emotional/ motivational).	cognition;cognitive science;online and offline	Naomi Miyake;Roy D.

They allow an instructor to teach a student using a shared virtual model, even if separated by distance. For these systems to be accepted within the surgical community there must be a compelling body of evidence that demonstrates that learning occurs in the training environment, and is transferable to the operating theatre. We have developed a networked multisensory virtual reality system for teaching surgery of the temporal bone and conducted a training transfer trial. To augment the quantitative analysis of the results, we have performed a qualitative analysis of the transcripts of videotapes of the learning phase of the trial, using techniques from Conversation Analysis. In this short paper we present a single case study that convincingly demonstrates that learning occurred within the instruction phase of the trial.	virtual reality	Matthew A.

The survey system was designed to understand the in-service educational demands for the teachers in Taiwan, R.O.C.. Two types of the questionnaires were used based on two different viewpoints: school administrative and teacher personal viewpoints. Each of questionnaire types is categorized into six questionnaires including kindergarten, elementary school, junior high school, senior high school, vocational high school, and special education school questionnaires. We introduce the background of the surveys and explain the computer software packages used in the survey system. We also propose the computer network structure and the data processing procedure of the survey system. We present the implementation results and discuss the problematic issues of the survey system. The surveys were held from February 24th, 2006 to March 19th, 2006. 56,245 samples were submitted via the internet. The case study of the implementation of the loosely coupling survey system could be valuable experience for people who want to process a large scale of network survey.	categorization;internet	Che-Chern Lin;Hung-Jen Yang;Lung-Hsing Kuo	2006	2006 International Conference on Information Technology: Research and Education	10.1109/ITRE.2006.381521	simulation;computer science;data science;multimedia	Robotics	-82.23650220698865	-29.17359119339174	47418

In order to provide personalized service to different users, user model (UM) can play an important role in U-Business. UM reflects some characteristics of users to a certain degree, which is used widely in U-Business, like personalized recommendation, social computing, information retrieval services, and so on. Currently, there are more and more researchers who focus on the building and update of UM based on the activities of people. However, as too many UM appeared, the number of UM in cyber space is increasingly large, which takes a lot of space and cost. Furthermore, after some users disappear in the physic world, their models are still working in the cyber world. This case is not reasonable obviously, but few researches take care about it. Therefore, one of important issues, the death of UM should be taken into account in the whole life-cycle of user model. This paper proposes a specific user modeling method for the Cyber Individuals (Cyber-I) in U-Business. The essential difference between this UM and traditional ones is that it has a life, that is, birth, growth, and demise, like a life-cycle of Cyber-I. Specially, the significance of UM life ending and five states of UM death are described from an organic viewpoint. In addition, there is a framework of the whole life process of UM. Finally, the proposed idea is applied to the field of personalized service.	cyberspace;information retrieval;mathematical optimization;mobile device;ontology components;personalization;personally identifiable information;privacy policy;social computing;spreading activation;tf–idf;user modeling	Bofeng Zhang;Jianxing Zheng;Jianhua Ma;Yinsheng Li;Guobing Zou;Qun Jin	2012	Personal and Ubiquitous Computing	10.1007/s00779-012-0580-8	biological life cycle;simulation;user modeling;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia;world wide web	Web+IR	-63.77978376665374	-29.295861845049693	47421

This standardization will extend and widen the field of applications possible within the collaborative learning paradigm, and will make possible the usage of the fruits of years of research and individual implementations of the concept of collaborative learning, from our own laboratory and from others. 1. Collaborative Learning Support Distributed [4,5] collaborative learning [1,3,6,7,8] support is a research domain that tries to find out ways to support the collaboration of multiple learners on the network (CSCL Computer Supported Collaborative Learning), in problem solving or other cooperative curriculum activities, according to the used LT (Learning Technology). Compared to CSCW (Computer Supported Cooperative Work), CSCL has as a goal not so much the working efficiency, but the learning achievement efficiency, and the promotion of deep understanding of the subject field by the learner, combined with the recognition or meta-recognition of the achievement of this ability by other persons. The regular CSCL groupware implementation provides usually two types of activity space: a private and a collaborative working space, where the learners can exchange information in a synchronous or asynchronous manner. 2. Primitive Activities and Resources Primitive activities in collaborative learning are: Dialogue (with Interaction), Data/Idea sharing, Observing/ suggesting, Turn-taking, Coordinating/ Control, Planning/ Executing, Initiative/ Supervising. The resources required in collaborative learning are: Dialogue Channel, Shared Workplace (shared object space), Technologically mediated remote communication (audio & visual), Personal Workplace. 3. Collaborative Environment Structure For collaborative learning, we can differentiate between learner-to-learner dialogue (communication) and other activities (problem solving, etc.). When a learner faces a problem that s/he cannot solve, s/he can, in collaborative learning, exchange meaningful information via interactions with his/her learning companion(s). This can lead to understanding other persons' perception ways and also help in finding eventual inconsistencies in ones own judgments. Present researches analyze such interactions, their catalyzators and effects. Moreover, as the learning efficiency has been shown to increase in such situations, many systems try to positively encourage them via computer implementations. 4. Essential Structural Elements Learners can belong to one or more groups and can be involved in projects or parts of projects together, therefore sharing a particular space, and work privately for the rest. The shared working place (collaborative workplace) contains the dialogue support objects for dialogue and information exchange support, the collaborative working objects for activity support, and the collaborative memory, for reference and information accumulation. On the other hand, the private working place contains the working depository of the private working objects, and the private memory for consultation and accumulation of private activities related information. Moreover, the information referencing layer contains information oriented towards individual and collaborative learning goals, learning materials, various educational data, libraries, educational applications, all-purpose tools, market applications, etc. There are 6 essential structural elements of the collaborative learning environment standardization: 1. collaborative learning environment expression 2. collaborative workspace expression 3. collaborative learning resource(s) expression 4. collaborative workplace expression 5. learner group model in collaborative learning 6. collaborative memory structure expression Due to the lack of space, these items are not detailed here. 5. Info Retrieval in Collaborative Learning The collaborative learning support system has to able, at the learner's request, to send and receive information on the essential elements of both collaborative and private workspace. E.g., a loading function is necessary, which fetches collaborative/private work objects, requested by the group or by individual learners, from various resource(s) (load_into relation). This relation is defined within the essential structural elements of the collaborative learning environment. Another relation ensures the sending and receiving of problem solving communication data within the collaborative working place, between the dialogue support objects and the collaborative working objects (link_to relation). Another relation ensures the Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Techniques (ICALT’01) 0-7695-1013-2/01 $10.00 © 2001 IEEE inserting/ saving of objects, results and information from the private workplace of the private workspace as collaborative work objects of the collaborative workplace (insert_in relation). The relations between the collaborative work objects and the collaborative memory are """"store_to"""", for storing work objects into the collaborative memory, and """"refer_to"""" when referring objects already stored. We are gradually building the essential functions, which can be extended to serve any collaborative learning environment. 6.

Although the importance of bioinformatics training is widely recognized, little attention has been paid to its effect on the acceptance of bioinformatics by biologists. In this study, the effect of training on biologists' acceptance of bioinformatics tools was tested using the technology acceptance model (TAM) as a theoretical framework. Ninety individuals participated in a field experiment during seven bioinformatics workshops. Pre- and post-intervention tests were used to measure perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and intended use of bioinformatics tools for primer design and microarray analysis—a simple versus a complex tool that is used for a simple and a complex task, respectively. Perceived usefulness and ease of use were both significant predictors of intended use of bioinformatics tools. After hands-on experience, intention to use both tools decreased. The perceived ease of use of the primer design tool increased but that of the microarray analysis tool decreased. It is suggested that hands-on training helps researchers to form realistic perceptions of bioinformatics tools, thereby enabling them to make informed decisions about whether and how to use them. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	bioinformatics	Aviv Shachak;Sara Fine	2008	JASIST	10.1002/asi.20772	simulation;field experiment;usability;human–computer interaction;computer science;artificial intelligence;data mining;world wide web	HCI	-67.09121637236946	-50.4157296068298	47475

cd33424be821778935189b90a168dedf58d0951e	a tool for evaluating, adapting and extending game progression planning for diverse game genres		Game progression design is a demanding, data-intensive design activity that is typically performed by game designers without even basic computational support. To address this, a concept for tool-supported “progression planning” has been proposed and implemented by Butler, Smith, Liu u0026 Popovic for the design of their educational puzzle game Refraction. Refraction is a game that has relatively undemanding progression design needs. Further tool development and practice-based evaluation is needed to establish whether– and if so, how– a generic, tool-supported progression design process can address the diverse range of often complex progression design challenges that game designers find themselves engaging with. In this paper we describe how we used three game design case studies in contrasting game genres to inform the development of a tool that adapts and extends the progression planning approach.

Orientation of the younger generation of students in the regular use of the SN in their daily, academic and professional life casts doubt on the prospects of the development of traditional learning management systems (LMS). The article examines the attitudes of students and teachers to the possibilities in learning LMS and SN, compared the advantages and disadvantages of the various e-learning technologies. The study analyzed the results of the survey respondents from 25 universities of the Russian Federation, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. For the analysis of the responses were used statistical treatment of data and content analysis. The study identified features of the application in the training of LMS and SN, different attitudes of students and teachers to the LMS and SN.	social network	Artem Feshchenko;Galina Mozhaeva;Ivan Kulikov;Nadezhda Zilberman	2015			psychology;mathematics education;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;management;pedagogy;social network	HCI	-73.1588782153304	-34.48736690142026	47771
585b9f51434d6414b4d25f268e4dae5812bb76da	editorial: university-supported learning		Traditionally, universities have been engaged in offering opportunities for the learning of formalised (‘scientific’) knowledge; the learners have come to universities with the intention of learning some fairly well prescribed formal knowledge. But there is another equally important form of knowledge, that which is grounded in practice and professional activity. This form of knowledge is often informal, tacit and is developing continually in all working communities. Universities have no particular insight into such knowledge but they can facilitate the process of the exchange of this knowledge, acting as reflective participants in communities of peers. Moreover, current thinking suggests that knowledge only takes on meaning in context; that what we know is not based on a purely internal map of the world but is intrinsically linked with the outside world, artefacts (including other people), culture and history. These perspectives demand that a fundamentally new look at the function of universities in their support of learning is required and it should be recognised that the context of knowledge is as important as the content. Communications technologies offer various opportunities: • campus network use to allow traditional students better access to resources (including tutors); • widening the accessibility of existing courses to off-campus students (including those in other countries); but perhaps more fundamentally • providing a focus for those seeking continuing learning to set the agenda for ‘learning’ in such a way that learning becomes predominantly a process of knowledge exchange with peers (tutors providing process rather than content contributions). The same technologies also offer the opportunity for inter-institutional collaboration and this is being explored in a number of projects in Europe and in North America. One key issue concerns the role of individuals: “A key to successful inter-institutional relationships is dedicated champions at all collaborating institutions. These champions must define shared goals and objectives. Also, these goals and objectives must consider the diversity of each institution and thus have meaning and importance to local constituents. . . . The shared goals and objectives of the (innovative teaching) project must point towards some viable payoff for each faculty member. . . As with projects within most organizations, without champions and clearly defined goals, little success can be realized.”	accessibility		1997	J. Comp.

Studies of the many facets of distance education have become increasingly common [21][2][22], and within recent years many universities have experimented with various formats in an effort to determine their effectiveness. Some studies have developed frameworks for discussion of appropriate tools and techniques [10], while others have provided us with more detailed guides for implementation and evaluation.[7].Today most distance education techniques tend to be asynchronous. The idea behind course management systems, archived resources, discussion lists and the like is to provide an environment in which the distant student can gain an education on an """"any time, any place"""" basis. Live streaming video and video on demand techniques can play an important role in this process. Of important note, many of the tools are also applicable in traditional settings.There are also an increasing number of tools and techniques designed to support distributed learning activities in real time (synchronous) settings. Certainly the past evolution of telephony-based support services has proved to be a harbinger of the importance of synchronous techniques -- so much so that the use of Web meeting spaces, video over Internet protocol (hereafter referred to as 'IP'), and networked collaboration tools have begun to evolve noticeably. Data collaboration tools may be among the most important of these. As above, many of these techniques are also applicable in traditional settings.Little summative work appears to have been done regarding the role these technologies play in teaching and learning innovation. This paper includes a discussion of the nature of innovation, along with a comparison of synchronous and asynchronous techniques within the context of disruptive technologies; a framework that can be used for synchronous/asynchronous comparative analyses; and the results of the experiences of the authors as they applied these technologies to classroom settings."""	archive;streaming media	Jim Leonard;Elizabeth Riley;E.

e7594f3dca03cd67f3faf3ff5bd29af5a78f3455	the integration of print and digital content for providing learners with constructive feedback using smartphones		Abstract#R##N##R##N#Timely feedback is considered essential for supporting professional growth and personal development. However, it is difficult to employ such feedback in traditional learning environments. Recently, smartphones are considered as educational tools for supporting instructional activities. Therefore, this study attempts to leverage the advantages of physical textbooks and mobile devices. A pedagogical strategy called constructive feedback was proposed to provide learners with real-time and personalized suggestions according to the results of electronic assessment. Two types of connectivity techniques, namely QR Codes and hyperlinking, were applied for integrating printed materials and digital content. An experiment was conducted in a university course entitled Computer Networks, and a total of 80 students were recruited to participate in this experiment. The findings revealed that the strategy of constructive feedback had a significant influence on learning performance. However, no significant differences on learning performance were found between using QR Codes and using hyperlinking. Finally, implications of the findings were discussed for further research directions and practical applications.	digital recording;smartphone	Nian-Shing Chen;Chun-Wang Wei;Yen-Chieh Huang;Kinshuk	2013	BJET	10.1111/j.1467-8535.2012.01371.x	simulation;computer science;multimedia;communication;world wide web;pedagogy	HCI	-73.29462580560156	-40.692076777837336	47801

Although a substantial amount of use occurred, problems in interfacing with the district's pre-existing physical infrastructure, its bureaucratic procedures, and the culture of its schools all influenced use markedly. Infrastructure problems included difficulties retrofitting old buildings, including asbestos in school walls, and lack of needed power outlets, space, and furniture. Bureaucratic problems included incompatibility between rigid bell schedules and the unpredictability of access to Internet sites. Finally, cultural factors including the teachers' role as dispenser of knowledge, the image of a well-run classroom as one in which students sit quietly in their seats, the tendency to emphasize basic skills and to conceptualize learning along disciplinary lines, and concerns about ensuring that the materials students access in school are consistent with community beliefs and standards also shaped and limited Internet use.

These computer engineers not only play a key role in the national development of the computing and software industries, they also have a significant influence on the broader national knowledge industry. Therefore, one of the objectives of information education in Taiwan is to cultivate elite talents specializing in computer programming so as to improve Taiwan’s national competitiveness. Although programming is a major fundamental subject for students in information sciences, learning to master programming languages is far from easy. Accordingly, this study aimed to establish a personalized remedial learning system to assist learners in remedial learning after an online assessment. The proposed system adopted the fuzzy logic theory to construct an appropriate learning path based on the learners’ misconceptions found in a preceding quiz. With concepts of each course constructed in a learning path, the proposed system will select the most suitable remedial materials for a learner in terms of learner preference to facilitate more efficient remedial learning. Finally, the system, proven by several conducted experiments, can offer a comprehensive and stable remedial learning environment for any e-learning programs. The analysis of learners’ achievements confirmed that the method of this study has achieved the effects of remedial learning and adaptive learning.	cognitive science;compiler;computer engineering;computer programming;experiment;fuzzy logic;information science;national supercomputer centre in sweden;personalization;programming language;theory (mathematical logic)	Tung-Cheng Hsieh;Ming-Che Lee;Chien-Yuan Su	2013	Educational Technology & Society		fuzzy logic;programming;cooperative learning;educational technology;error-driven learning;simulation;cognitive style;computer science;experiential learning;remedial education;learning sciences;multimedia;active learning;management;open learning;synchronous learning;pedagogy	AI	-77.2827203904871	-42.03007208748572	48098

CANA primarily involves face-to-face interactions among students supported by wirelessly interconnected mobile devices to solve collaboratively a set of multiple-choice questions. The learning outcomes of a CANA applied in two computer science courses are presented. Better results were obtained in a course where reasoning and deduction capacities were important than there were in a technical one where students were required to learn specific knowledge and apply it. A CANA design is described that will permit its reuse in various instructional scenarios. This design is defined as a collaborative learning activity pattern and is specified using IMS learning design, an established method of learning scenario description. The application of this method revealed the need to incorporate the notion of joint problem space, a shared knowledge space that supports the collaborative work of the activity.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;apply;computer science;data structure;diagram;information management system (ims);interaction;jump point search;knowledge space;mobile device;natural deduction;pattern language;problem domain;requirement;sensitivity and specificity;specification language;unified modeling language	Ricardo Valdivia;Miguel Nussbaum;Sergio F.

This pilot study is part of a country wide study on the aspects of knowledge sharing in libraries. Findings — The results showed that library professionals in the Education City, Qatar were involved in a lot of knowledge sharing activities among colleagues within their library and other libraries. The result also identifies the knowledge sources and with whom they share what. It was also found that cultural differences, language and library policies are important factors that have impacted significantly the flow of knowledge in the expatriate library community. Research limitations/implications — The coverage on the universities in this paper is confined primarily to Education City, where majority of the universities are present. However, future research could include the few other universities/colleges that are out of the ambit of Education City to have a wider population in the study. Practical implications — This paper has practical implications for those who are not fully aware of the working conditions in this region and Qatar in particular. It provides a useful overview of the knowledge sharing trends and requirements and the impediments to sharing vital knowledge that would help professionals in gaining some knowledge about the constraints and be prepared. Originality/Value — There are no previous studies undertaken on knowledge sharing among library professionals in this region. This is the first ever study undertaken to understand the knowledge sharing attributes and trends among librarians in Qatar. So this study would be in the interest of all the library professionals that are contemplating an international career in this region and also understand the cultural and other differences when they arrive.

Enough has been written about the support crisis in academic technology that it is easier for administrators to understand the need for staffing. In this case, the cost of dedicating a full-time staff member to supporting faculty development should be looked at in the context of the whole faculty and the whole curriculum. In that context, an incremental cost of less than 1% provides far more than that amount in benefits. The final chapter in our faculty development effort is not yet written, but the ability to reach a greater proportion of the faculty this year, together with the earlier programs for access and academic facilities appears to be finally working to produce the desired result.	ubiquitous computing	Mark Weiser	1998	Commun.

Subjectivity is especially true for disciplines in which perceptual factors play a key role in the evaluation. In previous decades, computer-based assessment techniques were developed to address the above-mentioned challenges and to automatically grade students' work in a variety of educational fields. In this paper, the application of automatic assessment strategies in the unexplored domain of computer graphics is discussed. In particular, a tool that is designed to evaluate student assignments for a 3D computer animation course taught at Politecnico di Torino University is presented. During laboratory examination sessions, students are requested to individually operate on the open-source Blender suite and to recreate a 3D animation similar to a reference one. Student's output is assessed against a set of similarity indicators, which are specifically designed to capture the technical and perceptual factors that would be blended in a traditional teacher's evaluation. A comparison of the results that are achieved by the computer-based tool with grades assigned by visual inspection confirms the effectiveness of the designed approach and displays a high-quality concurrence between automatic and manual evaluations.	3d computer graphics;aggregate data;blender (software);computer animation;crowdsourcing;feedback;numerical analysis;open-source software;reference model;self-replicating machine;sticky bit;test set;visual inspection	Fabrizio Lamberti;Andrea Sanna;Gianluca Paravati;Gilles Carlevaris	2014	IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies	10.1109/TLT.2014.2340861	anime;simulation;computer facial animation;human–computer interaction;computer science;artificial intelligence;computer animation;multimedia;computer graphics;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	-68.87215457672968	-43.752981320873	48599

The intervention includes automated interactive lessons and self-assessments, homework assignments, and group discussions in private online forums. A randomized, controlled experiment (N=64) was conducted to evaluate (a) the efficacy of Career HOPES and (b) the contribution of professional moderation of the online group discussions to outcomes. Participants in two treatment conditions showed greater gains than control condition participants in career decidedness as measured by the Occupational Alternatives Questionnaire (d=.54), occupationally relevant self-knowledge (d=.58), and emission of career exploration behaviors (d=.50). In one of the treatment conditions, the online group discussions were moderated by a psychologist with career counseling experience; in the other treatment condition, the discussions were unmoderated. Professional moderation resulted in better outcomes on several variables and greater overall satisfaction with the intervention.

Whilst agreement has begun to emerge on the effects media has on cognitive performance, little is understood about the relationship between such media effects and individual differences such as individuals who have dyslexia. This paper presents findings from a study that investigated the effects computer-based media can have on the learning outcomes of individuals who have dyslexia compared to those who do not have dyslexia. The purpose of the study was to obtain data that informed the development and design of e-learning and distance learning materials for universal use. The research process was based on Dual Coding Theory and refined by current theories on dyslexia. Findings from the research are intended to help academics and providers of e-learning materials to improve the design and delivery of their learning contents.	biological anthropology;bottom-up proteomics;coding theory;digital media;discrete cosine transform;mcgurk effect;replication (computing);top-down and bottom-up design;video game graphics;while	Nigel A.

A multi-dimensional questionnaire was designed to evaluate each aspect in terms of perceived capability, experience, and interest. The analyses explore (1) potential differences of students’ perceptions between Internet-based and face-to-face learning environments and (2) potential differences in the three aspects in relation to learners’ attributes and the use of the Internet and enrollment in online courses. This study surveyed students in a higher education institute who had had experiences with Internet-based and face-to-face learning. The results showed that students perceived higher levels of collaboration (capability only), SRL (capability and experience) and IS (capability, interest, and experience) in Internet-based learning than in traditional learning environments. In terms of students’ education level, graduate students perceived higher levels of capabilities and interests in some of the aspects, than undergraduate students. In addition, for Internet-based learning, significant differences in collaboration and SRL were found derived from time spent on the Internet related to learning; and students’ perceptions of collaboration, SRL, and IS were all positively correlated to students’ online course-taking experience. Implications for online learning practices and instructor’s facilitation are discussed. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Quantitative and qualitative methodologies were used with participants of the study. Twenty-six science PSTs, enrolled in an Egyptian university, represented the study's experiential and control groups. Pre and post-tools were administered to participants in the two groups in a quasiexperimental design. Instruments to measure dependent variables of the study were developed by the authors in light of relevant previous studies. The findings suggest that PSTs in the experimental group have higher achievement levels in their post-overall-course-test, 'comprehensive-score', and attitudes towards e-learning environments compared to those of the control group. The specific design of the course may be responsible for these changes. Future implications and suggestions for teacher educational programmes are presented.

The study is intended to help software designers detemine which method to implement when helping users compare alternatives, The AHP method requires more user time and effort than MRO; our goal was to ezplore whether AHP provided suficient benefits over MRO to warrant the additional time it requires. Eighteen subjects were asked to use software tools implementing AHP and MRO. They compared student applicationfiles and identified applicants most qualified for admission to graduate school. The results showed that although AHP required more tame than MRO, AHP resulted in lower variance in the assessments produced by different decision makers. This may be ezplained by the richer information collected by the AHP method, resulting in more accumte reflections of decision makers’ assessments. Thus, for high criticality domains, AHP may	analytical hierarchy;criticality matrix;reflection (computer graphics);tame	Farnaz Akhavi;Caroline C.

d8ae8f5c823e17e4424b34c7df4ca888561f3a50	phymel-ws: physically experiencing the virtual world. insights into mixed reality and flow state on board a wheelchair simulator		Psychology has widely probed the relationship between body, mind and emotions, these findings have been traditionally applied to physical learning but its penetration into the academic environment was still slower than expected. Virtual worlds, augmented reality and gamification applied to learning experiences, have once again highlighted the correlation between the emotional state of the student and his learning outcomes. There have been many studies around the concept of flow proposed by Csíkszentmihályi in 1988, what factors influence their extent and how to promote it. Although the proposed model is widely accepted by the scientific community there are some studies showing discrepancies between theoretical models and experimental results. The scientific community demands more studies on how to measure flow and how to analyse the factors behind these discrepancies. This paper presents a study with 20 students between 21 and 36 years using a wheelchair simulator to reach awareness about the difficulties that people with disabilities face daily. Experience confirms the discrepancies between emotions calculated from the model and expressed directly by students. Two of the main findings of this study are: (1) the influence of gender on emotions and (2) some of the factors that moderate the theoretical measures to fit empirical values are related to the four defining traits of a game proposed by McGonigal (challenging goals, clear rules, real time feedback and voluntary participation).	augmented reality;experience;gamification;mixed reality;simulation;virtual world	M.

However, making it a reality in traditional classroom settings is a big challenge. One possible alternative is to deliver lecture through short, bite-sized chunks of videos over the Internet which the students can access using their own devices at their own time, thus creating a flexible learning environment. This again posts another challenge in terms of its functionalities in bandwidth-scarce situations. This paper conducts a feasibility study of developing such a system, termed integrated learning platform, or iLEAP, by utilising adaptive streaming technology algorithms. iLEAP is intended to host lecture videos as well as discussion forums for students to engage in active discussions among themselves. This paper discusses the methods by which the data size can be reduced so as to enable the platform to work satisfactorily under varying network conditions. Evaluation of some of these techniques is done to show the viability of such a system which can enhance the learning experience of students. The paper concludes with further insights on the possibility of such techniques in other useful areas such as telemedicine.	algorithm;internet	Kok Kiong Tan;Arun-Shankar Narayanan	2015	2015 IEEE 7th International Conference on Cybernetics and Intelligent Systems (CIS) and IEEE Conference on Robotics, Automation and Mechatronics (RAM)	10.1109/ICCIS.2015.7274560	simulation;computer science;multimedia;world wide web	Robotics	-79.06358885576503	-41.19100120744524	49058

The objective was to raise the communication level and accessibility, as well as the dissemination of knowledge and learning. The significance of the research is based in the fact that today, almost every student has a mobile device at all times while not everyone has a computer and Internet connection at all times. In order to investigate this, a case study experiment was devised. It involved investigation into the factors that influence mobile applications.	accessibility;experiment;internet;mobile app;mobile device	Majlinda Fetaji;Bekim Fetaji	2008	ITI 2008 - 30th International Conference on Information Technology Interfaces	10.1109/ITI.2008.4588394	mobile search;human–computer interaction;computer science;operating system;mobile device;multimedia;mobile computing	SE	-69.76715208397825	-39.91920635060034	49106

We propose to use this context data as content for learning applications in workplace settings to enable employees to reflect on experiences from their work. Learning by reflection is essential for today's dynamic work environments, as employees have to adapt their behavior according to their experiences. Building on research on computer-supported reflective learning as well as persuasive technology, and inspired by the Quantified Self community, we present an approach to the design of tools supporting reflective learning at work by turning context information collected through sensors into learning content. The proposed approach has been implemented and evaluated with care staff in a care home and voluntary crisis workers. In both domains, tailored wearable sensors were designed and evaluated. The evaluations show that participants learned by reflecting on their work experiences based on their recorded context. The results highlight the potential of sensors to support learning from context data itself and outline lessons learned for the design of sensor-based capturing methods for reflective learning.	ambient intelligence;experience;persuasive technology;quantified self;sensor;wearable computer	Lars Müller;Monica Divitini;Simone Mora;Verónica Rivera-Pelayo;Wilhelm Stork	2015	IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies	10.1109/TLT.2014.2377732	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia;reflective practice;computational model;world wide web;data visualization;statistics	HCI	-69.14599114313525	-41.07573403606958	49261

Regularly scheduled mandatory training sessions increase student knowledge and reduce second level intervention in service requests due to consultant error or omission. Finally, having managers on each shift gives students a feeling for workplace hierarchy and reduces their reliance on full-time staff, thereby saving staff time and crucial dollars.	computer cluster;money	Quentin Calder	2002		10.1145/588646.588701	simulation;engineering;knowledge management;operations management	HCI	-76.58933394884151	-29.662208488488517	49417

The aim for this paper was to explore how people with lifelong disability experienced the relationship with their virtual self and others, applying the lens of Embodied Social Presence Theory. Based on data collected through participant observation and interviews with novice and experienced users of Second Life, our findings indicate that the relationship between humans and their avatar is strong. Further, the findings indicate that the relationship with a person’s own avatar and others in the virtual world requires time to develop and be meaningful for people with lifelong disability. The ability to create an avatar with no visible disability and to choose what to disclose about a disability, is important affordances offered by the virtual world to people with disability.

First experiments with game-based learning MOOCs had shown good results. In my research, I will focus on the integration of game-based learning to the openHPI MOOC platform. The use of game-based learning materials will be evaluated in three iterations: (1) by existing means the platform already offers, (2) by simple interactive exercises, and (3) by an educational game. The success of all iterations will be evaluated with user surveys and A/B testing. The research goal is to establish a tool for creating interactive exercises as well as the design of an appropriate educational game. Advantages and disadvantages of different game-based methods as well as best practices will be listed in the process.	a/b testing;best practice;experiment;iteration;massive open online course;openhpi	Christiane Hagedorn;Christoph Meinel	2017	2017 IEEE 17th International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT)	10.1109/ICALT.2017.119	game testing;knowledge management;massive open online course;multimedia;best practice;the internet;simulation;game developer;computer science;game design;game design document	Robotics	-77.68307457582732	-42.311491394371274	49483

With a lack of background in this field, the purpose of the study was to analyze the accessibility levels of different social media websites and aggregators. Based on W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, we have selected three automatic evaluation tools in order to realize a first set of preliminary tests. We verified that none of the websites clearly passed in the evaluation process and our sample didn't meet the adopted accessibility guidelines. The errors occurrence within the social media aggregators' tests was less than in the social media websites. Therefore, it seems to be indisputable to propose a tool that allows users to manage their own social media websites accounts in a more accessible way. Thus, this study presents a list of defined requirements to implement an accessible social media aggregator solution.	social media;social network aggregation	Mário Correia;Gonçalo Cruz;Ricardo Rodrigues Nunes;José Martins;Ramiro Gonçalves;Hugo Paredes;Paulo Martins	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-39191-0_70	public relations;social media optimization;engineering;web accessibility;internet privacy;world wide web	NLP	-64.89255116830904	-51.1724099860304	49587

With a range of representational and computational approaches, authors have repeatedly developed techniques that enable computers to generate, reason about, and adapt narratives in an interactive virtual setting. In order to fully realize an experience manager, seven representational and computational problems need to be solved, generally on a case-by-case basis. In other words, the choice to use an Experience Manager is the choice to model the design as, and implement solutions to, seven interdependent design problems. We explicitly articulate those design problems and provide a number of examples of methods that both motivate the design problems as well as illustrate a range of approaches to solving them.	computation;computational problem;computer;interdependence	David L.

This article looks at Willingness to Use Technology (WUT; MacLean & Elwood, 2009), an instrument developed to assess a potential technology user’s propensity to do so when choosing between a technological medium and a non-technological medium for doing a task. Data were collected from university students in Malaysia (n1⁄4 169), Cambodia (n1⁄4 131), and Japan (n1⁄4 1262). Descriptive statistics showed that Cambodian and Malaysian students were disposed toward selecting technological means for most tasks, while the preferences of the Japanese students varied by task. Rasch analysis showed that the items functioned satisfactorily, and results of two types of confirmatory factor analysis converged, indicating WUT consisted of two factors differentiated by the degree of synchronicity of communication in all three contexts. The investigation of partial-measurement invariance indicated that the factor composition was fundamentally invariant across the three Japan samples yet differed some across the three countries. Although its use in cross-cultural research contexts requires further consideration, the WUT instrument represents a robust measure of users’ behavior regarding technology in the specific contexts examined in this study. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

During car simulator-sessions we collected data over different traffic safety variables, such as speed, headway distance and lane change behavior, from 70 subjects. The data was analyzed in order to investigate possible individual learning effects and differences between groupings of subjects. The experiment shows clear positive individual learning effects for all traffic safety variables analyzed. Hence we conclude that game based simulations can be used to enhance learning in driving education.	experiment;simulation	Per Backlund;Henrik Engström;Mikael Johannesson;Mikael Lebram	2007	2007 11th International Conference Information Visualization (IV '07)	10.1109/IV.2007.54	simulation;engineering;transport engineering;multimedia	Robotics	-69.32955950335422	-44.44743094607154	49664
20e3ea561365722f60b20ccac61ed597adfb1abe	emerging framework for planning and implementation of online programs		"""The dramatic growth of online education over the past two decades is requiring colleges to make a shift from fragmented approaches to program planning and implementation towards a framework integrating both into a coherent support system. This article provides an overview of an emerging holistic framework for planning and implementation of online programs calling for shared strategic planning needs assessment strategies, and establishing program consensus. Guided by a program vision, curriculum and instructional strategies are identified along with internal and external supports needed for successful implementation. The framework suggests demand-driven strategic planning, benchmarking approaches to implementation practices, and interactive feedback to ensure effective program planning and implementation. online courses and programs to accommodate flexible schedules to balance education, work, and family (Hernandez-Gantes, 2009). Facing an increased competition for this growing segment of the student market, universities have rushed to embrace online education, which in some cases has yielded mixed results (Allen & Seaman, 2008; Bower, 2001; National Center for Education Statistics, 2000). As online programs become more prominent, the uneven quality of online education has been a lingering issue over the years, prompting some authors to equate online programs as “diploma mills” (Noble, 2002).

Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited. At issue may be the lack of standardized institutional procedures for program and coursework development treating online curriculum development in traditional ways regardless of the obvious differences in delivery requirements (Hernandez, Kirby, & McGee, 2004; Hernandez-Gantes, 2010). The pressure to keep up with the demand for online coursework has prompted universities to emphasize quick implementation strategies for online course and program development. Thus, reports of institutions demanding faculty to convert their face-to-face courses into online format are not uncommon (Bower, 2001; Noble, 2002). In this context, strategic and holistic approaches to planning and implementation to ensure the quality, success, and sustainability of online education have received only scant attention in the literature (Adelman & Taylor, 2003; Hache, 2000; Levy, 2003). The planning process for justifying a shift to online education to ensure program viability appears to be taken for granted in the literature, while implementation approaches have primarily focused on curriculum and instruction with limited attention to other internal and external supports as a comprehensive approach (Bunn, 2001; Levy, 2003; McPherson & Hansen, 2009). In recent years, however, the calls for quality assurances extending to program justification and sustainability have gained ground (Lee & Dziuban, 2002). This article provides an overview of an emerging holistic framework for planning and implementation of online programs. The article begins with a brief description of general online education trends followed by a discussion of issues associated with program development and implementation. Next, planning and implementation factors are introduced drawing from a related review of literature and experience delivering online programs in career and workforce education. The article concludes with an outline of an emerging holistic framework for online program planning and implementation and relevant underlying trends. bACKGROUND Online education has become a viable and popular alternative to traditional classroom instruction in higher education. However, as it evolved over the past two decades, the term has been associated with many terms warranting clarification. Concurrently, the growth of online education has been remarkable and it is important to highlight enrollment trends as evidence of its rising prominence and the need for systemic approaches to planning and implementation. Clarifying Online Education In this article, online education is referred to as the delivery system underlying a wide array of programs and courses involving different combinations of technology such as the Internet, electronic libraries, web-based conferencing, virtual discussions, and e-mail communication (Anderson, 2008). Online education falls under the broader umbrella of distance education involving formal and planned delivery of instruction to students attending at different locations either at the same time (synchronous) or at different times (asynchronous) (Havice & Havice, 2005; Conrad, 2008). Because online education is delivered completely on the Internet it is also considered as a subset of virtual education, which is defined as asynchronous learning involving minimal or no classroom interactions (Anderson, 2008; Conrad, 2008; TallentRunnels et al., 2006). Further, Web-based education is a variation emphasizing the use of online learning strategies, while hybrid or blended education refers to classroom instruction complemented with online components. Typically, web-based management systems such as Blackboard, WebCT, Angel, and others are used to deliver online education (Conrad, 2008; Hernandez-Gantes, 2009).

It has been established that educational software is often enough implemented during the classes on world study in primary school in comparison with natural science lessons provided in basic school. Primary educational software is regularly used in the city site, less frequently – in the regional centre and rarely in the rural area schools. On the opposite of the city site schools, basic educational software is widely employed in the rural area. The comparison of the rates of implementation of educational software during the different classes on natural sciences reveals that educational software is most frequently applied during the classes on biology, the least frequently – during the classes on physics.

For this to work well there must be an intuitive interface coupled to an appropriate set of focused examples. The examples then provide the scaffolding to enable students' discovery. CFX (C For eXample) provides the needed easy-to-use web based interface.A small pilot study showed that students using CFX could find answers to their programming questions in roughly half the time it took using a textbook. Freely distributed as open source software under the GNU General Public License [4], CFX can be used as a database authoring tool to capture a set of examples. Once the content is established, the interface as well as the data can be automatically exported to a standalone dynamic interface, using static, non-database content.The development of this system has been sponsored in part by NSF's CCLI program, with sample content developed in conjunction with McGraw-Hill.	gnu;ibm notes;open-source software	Dale Reed;Sam John;Ryan Aviles;Feihong Hsu	2004		10.1145/971300.971426	simulation;computer science;operating system;software engineering;database;programming language;world wide web	HCI	-83.28077804448428	-37.964239930606915	49741

Specifically, nurses lack sufficient background to engage with information systems, electronic records, and unit-level and aggregated data that could support understanding of the contributions of nursing services to care and the development of best practice guidelines. Given that nursing leadership is needed in this area, the authors conducted a review of graduate nursing curricula preparing nurses to take on leadership, management and executive roles. Findings revealed that only 12 out of 36 graduate nursing programs on the west coast of the US and Canada required any content in informatics, and five more offered elective opportunities. Implications for education and practice are discussed.		Mary Oakes;Noreen Frisch;Pamela Potter;Elizabeth M.

Specially, STEM education is intricately difficult and if the student is not well involved, supported and motivated, the chances of success are very low, which can be verified by the 25% to 30% dropout rate per semester in our institution. Given this scenario, a qualification program denominated “multiple vortexes of know-how” was conceived to address three aspects: (i) reduce student dropout; (ii) enlarge the reachable community; (iii) offer different levels of knowledge. Vortex is in essence an action, working interconnected and coordinated to other vortexes. Four different actions were prepared: classroom disciplines; a talent development program; holding short-term events, and enrolling in intensive training. This present work describes the vortex that enrolled the major number of students: the classroom disciplines. A catalog of optional undergraduate and graduate disciplines was offered to the students. The best students received a prize based on their performance. In summary, we had around 650 students qualified with 84 scholarship prizes granted. The paper will present as a contribution to the program, the catalog of disciplines and recommendations on how to proceed with the activities.	dropout (neural networks);programmer;vortex	Elaine H. T.

Due to this distinction, Western learners of Chinese often experience more difficulties in grasping correct character stroke sequence and/or stroke direction relative to native Chinese speakers. In this paper, we designed a HanZi writing environment with automatic feedback to address the above issue. Before the collection of HanZi characters on a massive scale, we conducted a pilot study to collect handwritten Chinese samples from 160 college students in the U.S. The findings from this study enabled us to further refine the learning environment and design optimal learning and teaching strategies for learners and teachers.

A new online headquarters for information literacy and library instruction under development at the University of Hawaii at Manoa Libraries will move beyond the earlier static web versions of bibliographic instruction and begin to engage the user in an active learning process through animation, feedback, and flexibility. Successful web-based delivery of basic library skills instruction begins with careful planning, an organizational commitment to the technology, and attention to sound pedagogical practice. More specifically, the design should: 1) provide the user with the opportunity to interact with the lessons and receive immediate feedback; 2) allow for easy integration by faculty to course-related assignments; 3) be flexible and accommodate alternate learning styles; 4) move beyond simple mechanics of navigating a database or catalog; 5) bridge familiar experiences to new applications; and 6) provide clear and easy access to a librarian for further assistance.

This study investigates what learners think while posing problems as sentence integration in terms of intermediate products as well as the posed problems as the resultant product. Problem posing as sentence integration defines the arithmetic word problem structure, and posing a problem is a task to satisfy all the constraints and requirements to build a valid structure. A previous study shows that, in problem posing as sentence integration for arithmetic word problems, learners try to satisfy a relatively large number of constraints in the posed problems. In contrast, this study focuses on the violation of constraints in the intermediate products while posing problems. The result shows that learners were inclined to avoid as many violated constraints as possible throughout the problem-posing process. Although learners tend to avoid the violated constraints, naturally, they cannot avoid some mistakes. Further analysis shows that learners actually have difficulty in fulfilling particular constraints while posing the problems. Based on this analysis, it is possible to detect the difficulty of learners' actions from the model perspective. Hence, it is possible to give accurate feedback and appropriately support the learners.	norm (social);requirement;resultant	Ahmad Afif Supianto;Yusuke Hayashi;Tsukasa Hirashima	2017		10.1186/s41039-017-0057-5	management science;knowledge management;educational technology;word problem (mathematics education);computer science;artificial intelligence;learning analytics;sentence;computer-mediated communication	AI	-72.2127670014527	-47.71122571805325	50035

Both previous generations of e-Learning (1.0 and 2.0) closely parody the prevalent technologies available in their kin Web versions (1.0 and 2.0, respectively). In order to acquire a better perspective to assess what technologies will be available in the Web 3.0 and therefore e-Learning 3.0, we take a historical glance at the previous generations of e-Learning and the Web. We then survey some existing predictions for eLearning 3.0 and finally provide our own. Previous surveys tend to identify educational needs for e-Learning, and then discuss what technologies are required to satisfy these needs. Educational needs are an important factor, but the required technologies may not reach fruition. Gauging past trends we take the reverse approach by first identifying technologies that are likely to be brought forth by the Web 3.0, and only then looking at how these technologies could be utilized in the learning domain. In particular, we pinpoint Artificial Intelligence (more specifically Machine Learning and Data Mining) as a major driving force behind the Web 3.0. We therefore examine the influence that AI might exert on the development of e-Learning 3.0.	anytime algorithm;artificial intelligence;data mining;machine learning;microsoft kin;semantic web;the verge;web 2.0;world wide web	Neil Rubens;Dain Kaplan;Toshio Okamoto	2012		10.1007/978-3-662-43454-3_18	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;data mining;world wide web	AI	-64.41981789368215	-28.40477431643089	50064

A transversal competence is one which can be re-used when shifting to another context. Our goal is to contribute to improve Computer Science 1 (CS1) course’s results by the systematic incorporation of activities based on transversal competencies. We designed a set of activities to enhance the development of transversal competencies, specially planning and time management, team work and communication skills. Hypothetically, we propose that including this kind of activities helps to obtain better results in the course. An initial experimentation was done in 2010. The preliminary results show a remarkable positive difference in student’s results. In the selected group the fail rate was only 12% (3 of 25 students). In other groups, the fail rate was 32% (8 of 25 students) and 40% (8 of 20 students). In previous years, this rate was approximately 40%.

The main idea of MAL is to enhance learning outcomes using motivational and social learning experiences. The lecture format is designed for courses, which combine theory in computer science with hands-on programming challenges and collaborative in-course problem solving. The main features of MAL include collaborative learning, constant activities to stimulate interactions between instructor and students, immediate feedback for self-assessment, and motivational feedback such as badges or leaderboard information. The course is structured in the form of mini lectures with constant interactive challenges and interactions such as small arithmetic problems, programming challenges, or research and discussion assignments, which are available using a learning management system as supportive in-course technology to provide the interactive course content and according immediate feedback. First outcomes show positive impact on student motivation and attention during the lessons. Also, more students are willing to complete bonus tasks volunaryly do gain extra points.	competitive programming;computer science;experience;gamification;hands-on computing;interaction;problem solving	Johanna Pirker;Christian Gütl	2014		10.1145/2538862.2544285	collaborative learning;cooperative learning;educational technology;error-driven learning;simulation;computer science;knowledge management;experiential learning;learning sciences;multimedia;active learning;pedagogy	AI	-75.6418562832747	-38.72906276792184	50237

Factors promoting and impeding the growth and diffusion of GIS are identified and suggestions for action on the part of higher education GIS specialists are made. In the United States more science teachers have adopted GIS geography/social studies teachers for several reasons. These include science teacher preservice preparation and the essentially different natures of the respective disciplines. Preservice education and teachers' perceptions of geography emerge as key factors influencing the diffusion of GIS in K-12 classrooms. The need for on cognition and GIS before effective curricula and instruction can be developed is emphasized. Three strategies directed at higher education GIS specialists may help implement this eduational innovation. They are: (1) modelling GIS instruction in content classes; (2) including GIS in preservice preparation classes; and (3) outreach to professors who tach educational technology to educate than regarding GIS.

In the intervention, 67 native and immigrant children in the first and second years of kindergarten played vocabulary games on the computer twice a week for a period of 15 minutes over 15 weeks. A control group of 97 kindergartners followed the regular curriculum. In a pre-test-training-post-test-retention test design, positive effects of the computer training were found on a curriculum-dependent vocabulary test. A trend was found towards positive effects of the computer training on a curriculum-independent test for children in their second year of kindergarten. The results present an alternative and relatively teacher-independent method to enlarge children's vocabularies.	vocabulary	Eliane Segers;Ludo Verhoeven	2003	J. Comp.

3d9e2820a5fc475b47ca26345f948196ddaaa6da	computational thinking: constructing the perceptions of pre-service teachers from various disciplines		In the last two decades, educators have been following the terminology of Computational Thinking first posed by Wing. Different viewpoints and commentaries have been adopted, and accordingly course syllabi and learning materials were developed, particularly for K-12. The field has become a mandatory part of the curriculum in various countries, even for preschool age. The paper presents an academic course for pre-service teachers with the main aim to facilitate and instruct students in the process of building their understanding and interpretation of Computational Thinking, in the context of teaching their own discipline. The course pedagogical approach emphasizes the adoption of Computational Thinking while identifying significant, non-trivial, computational processes in different disciplines. The course model was implemented with three pre-service teacher populations studying for their teaching certificate in: (1) sciences for high school; (2) humanities and social sciences for high school; and (3) various disciplines for elementary school. The course allows future teachers to experience for themselves learning activities that are recommended for implementation with their future students. The course pedagogical approach and rationale are presented, followed by detailed course structure and learning assignments. The teaching, learning, and assessment approach yielded impressive achievements, although not without obstacles and difficulties. The details of the course presentation enable its implementation with different populations of pre-service and in-service teachers, and can also be implemented in schools.	computation;computational thinking	Santiago Chiva San Román	2018		10.1007/978-3-030-02750-6_13	curriculum;certificate;perception;terminology;viewpoints;pedagogy;active learning;computational thinking;syllabus;computer science	Logic	-75.30068073577976	-35.575838381797276	50376

However, it is unlikely that these environments will benefit all students, so it is necessary to identify the student profiles that most benefit from confusion induction. We investigated how individual differences (e.g., prior knowledge, interest, attributional complexity) impacted confusion and learning outcomes in an environment that induced confusion via false system feedback (e.g., negative feedback after a correct response). A k-means cluster analysis revealed four clusters that varied on cognitive ability and cognitive drive. We found that students in the high cognitive ability + high cognitive drive cluster reported more confusion after receiving false feedback compared to the other clusters. These students also performed better on tasks requiring knowledge transfer, but only when they were meaningfully confused.	cluster analysis;cognition;confusion matrix;k-means clustering;negative feedback	Blair A.

Primary care physicians at two locations, who actively pursue continuing education, discuss the role of information technology in their daily professional practice and give their views about online education. This professional group is a good example of how a particular interaction style is significant to the collective cultural mores of a group. The paper concludes that these group preferences need to be taken into account when designing continuing education and some suggestions are made for design.	anytime algorithm;mores;web application	Jan Brace-Govan;Mark Gabbott	2004	Educational Technology & Society		attitude;distance education;programming;educational technology;the internet;data model;computer science;knowledge management;query by example;continuing professional development;rdf;peer-to-peer;binary relation;multimedia;management;metadata;world wide web;database design;hierarchical database model;pedagogy	HCI	-76.69120099794742	-38.65276912239142	50504

The IR Game is based on idea that test collections used in laboratorybased IR experiments could be used in instruction as a rapid query analysis tool. The goal is to provide a realistic environment for demonstrating the performance of queries in different types of search situations. The outline of the IR Game is introduced both at the technical and instructional levels. An evaluation experiment is reported revealing that students found different characteristics of the IR Game both enhancing and inhibiting learning. The perceived usefulness of features like query performancefeedback, visualization of serch results, comparison of queries, document browsing and help facilities are discussed. Several ideas for the elaboration of information retrieval learning environments are put forward. These include design of search tasks, implementation of feedback, social negotiation and articulation of student's working theories.	biconnected component;experiment;information retrieval;theory	Kai Halttunen;Eero Sormunen	2000	Education for Information			Web+IR	-70.67448904921606	-47.678773163315206	50587
76ad1e42b7cf8da1ae8c8f6729be0b912fc9a3b1	interaction matters in m-learning in situ		The use of mobile devices and Location-based Systems (LBS) enables technicians and practitioners to rethink learning, teaching and assessment strategies. The “Effective assessment in digital age” report claimed that technology has to be used to create authentic assessment (JISC, 2010). This authentic means that learners should be able to demonstrate and practice their skills like in real life tasks. Mobile phones integrate features such as cameras, Internet connection, GPS, etc. Several researchers study the effect of using these features to support situated learning activities. With the population of smartphones, approximately 10 years ago, the authors in this field showed special interest in understanding how to support principles of self-motivation and engagement during an exploratory learning experience by supporting students in their interaction with the space and with other players (Sharples et al, 2002; Facer et al., 2004). In particular, some authors studied how to use wireless communication and context awareness to assess/learn in situ the knowledge of students about local information (Huang et al 2009; Hwang & Chang, 2011, Santos et al, 2011). Nova, Girardin, & Dillenbourg (2005) performed an experiment where groups of students had to use Tablet PCs finding a virtual object in a campus by collaborating with team mates. As an experimental condition they studied the effect of using (or not) context-aware mechanisms with different groups. The groups without context-aware mechanisms had better communication with their partners than the groups that had the awareness. Their conclusion was: “location is not enough”, space and location-awareness are important data that can be provided during learning in situ experiences but the information cannot be limited to a simple broadcast of people’s positions. Previous studies have been mainly focused on understanding the learning benefits and behaviour of students when interacting with real locations/objects & peers by using mobile devices. But in this context two questions arise: • Are the current m-learning in situ solutions designed in a way that allows authors and learners to understand how to exploit the interaction possibilities (not only with physical objects/locations but also with their peers) in terms of learning benefits? • Which contextual and technological factors have to be considered when m-learning in situ activities are designed to support and promote the development of higher order skills? Holland et al (2000) claim that the organization of cognitive systems is extended to cover the interactions between people and with the resources and materials of the environment. The authors propose that cognitive processes are distributed amongst (1) other persons, (2) coordinated between internal and external structures and (3) distributed in time. For this reason I claim that in order to enhance cognitive processes, m-learning solutions have to provide guidance and scaffolding mechanisms (e.g. hints, awareness) based on the interaction possibilities. These mechanisms have to facilitate the design and enactment of the m-learning in situ activity, to enhance the process of decision-making and meaning making when interacting with contextual learning resources. The European Network of Excellence in TEL, STELLAR (2011) published a report titled “Education in the wild: contextual and location-based mobile learning in action” this report claims that a reconceptualization of educational theories have to be done in order to develop an approach for the present and future of learning designs (Cook, 2010). Cook proposes the term: Augmented Contexts for Development (ACD) where students have to use mobile phones to interact with each other and interact with the physical environment with the goal of creating their own ACD. In the line of understanding better how to improve the design of contextual m-learning in situ environments, Santos et al, (2013) study in real scenarios the factors that have to be considered when designing, virtually or in situ, mlearning situated activities. The results lead to a set of implications (in design, enactment and monitoring) for the development of mlearning systems. The main aim of this idea is to discuss how as technicians our role should be to design/implement tools that maximize the interaction possibilities of learning physical contexts. This idea claims that the interaction possibilities of mobile devices and their corresponding features (e.g. gps, camera, accelerometer..) can be studied and captuded as learning scaffolding mechanisms and included in authoring tools to guide users (e.g. teachers, learners) to understand how to create contextual learning in situ resources and activities. Our view is that mobile devices have the potential to develop new types of learning resources integrated within real locations (and physical objects) in ways that stimulate and motivate students and support their meaning making. My interest deals on researching a new approach for learning in situ activities, enhancing their design, creation, implementation and execution in order to support users through the different phases of these activities. M-learning tools should have to allow users to understand how to create personalized contextual learning content to potentiate their explorative and creativity skills, being more aligned with the current learning objectives of the educational curriculums.

Tablet devices are advantageous for such application due to their portability and capability to support not only text but also images and sound. A few elementary schools in Japan have already started introducing tablet devices into the classroom. This requires making some changes to the environment, including providing an access point for the tablets to communicate with each other. To aid in the preparation for computer supported learning, we propose using an ad hoc network of tablet devices to deploy a delay tolerant network with the aim of achieving high message reach ability over intermittent connections. The results of preliminary experiments show that our system can provide a high delivery rate, although its delivery speed is somewhat slow. We also created a practical application using the ad hoc network that students can use to exchange content.	delay-tolerant networking;experiment;hoc (programming language);tablet computer;wireless access point	Naoya Sasaki;Yuta Hanai;Noriko Akazawa;Yasuichi Nakayama;Ichiro Yamaguchi	2015	2015 International Conference on Learning and Teaching in Computing and Engineering	10.1109/LaTiCE.2015.34	wireless ad hoc network;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;simulation;mobile ad hoc network;computer science;distributed computing;multimedia	Mobile	-68.50263683622563	-40.48043029745903	50711

The goal of Project Tech is to leverage students interests in games and design to foster their problem-solving in a supportive environment where they learn to create games about a social issue they have experienced personally. The present study compares the in-school special needs version of Project Tech (n=11) to examine problem solving. Students enrolled in Project Tech were guided in the process of designing digital games aimed at teaching younger students (ages 1215) about social issues facing teenagers. A quantitative content analysis was conducted on 35 iterations of a directed design game and 35 iterations of a free design game created by special needs young people and director notes. The purpose of the study was to draw from the game iterations a list of empirically grounded problem solving attributes that are associated with digital game design in a special needs classroom. The findings of the study resulted in the understanding of problem solving with special needs young people in four areas: representative characteristics, planning characteristics, executing characteristics and evaluation characteristics. Game design promotes problem-solving skills in special needs young people.Ill-structured problem solving is supported by free design more than directed design.Free design promotes representation, planning and evaluating characteristics for problem solving.Directed design promotes executing characteristics for problem solving.	problem solving	Dana Ruggiero;Laura Green	2017	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2017.03.024	social psychology;knowledge management;special needs;social issues;management science;game design;game developer;content analysis;special education;game mechanics;computer science;game design document	HCI	-75.23210396337608	-35.729918234202515	50737

The volunteers take care of the site and of its visitors and perform a variety of important activities for preservation and outreach. With the purpose of co-envisioning and co-designing novel technological interventions to support the volunteers in engaging visitors and communicating the heritage site to the public, we have embarked on collaboration with the Cemetery Trust. In this paper we describe a particular study, conducted to glean an understanding of the volunteers' practices, concerns and strategies. We conclude by presenting a number of interaction concepts developed as part of co-design workshops and brainstorming sessions involving the volunteers that address their concerns and needs.	care-of address;field research	Luigina Ciolfi;Daniela Petrelli	2015		10.1145/2768545.2768547	humanities;geography;archaeology;anthropology	HCI	-65.61733465450708	-35.2280867542284	50761

In this study, we carried out an experiment on 30 university students to examine the effects of signals (graphical overview and highlight topic sentences) on hypertext reading by tablet computers. The results showed that signals would improve reading comprehension of participants with low reading skill, while it would reduce reading comprehension of participants with high or medium reading skill. Besides, signals had a significant influence on disorientation, however, no significant influence on cognitive load. It might be suggested that providing signals in hypertext would benefit readers with low reading skill.	graphical user interface;hypertext;tablet computer	Xiaoxia Zheng;Wei Cheng;Zhengcheng Fan;Guang Chen	2015	2015 IEEE 15th International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies	10.1109/ICALT.2015.80	navigation;educational technology;analysis of variance;human–computer interaction;computer science;organization;multimedia;reading;statistics	HCI	-70.0807162415177	-44.36981677020517	50789

It was a very hot topic back in the nineties, and theoretically it hasn't changed much in the last several years. In practice, it has proven to be a crucial component of many industrial and scientific processes, but has not yet become integral part of our daily lives. On the other hand, due to the advances in the information technology in the last decade, we are witnessing a drastic change in the daily human-computer interaction. The internet has become main information source, and with the growth of the mobile industries, more and more people are using their smartphones as their tool for retrieving this information. In this paper we will analyze the possibilities of using these advances to make a planning system that will optimize our daily activities.

0f4bb2b3343ea31daa2ea3014a5668ba75d026cf	generation of effective serious games with static and dynamic content	004 informatik	With video games being a huge market, attracting and engaging millions of players, it is tempting to use these motivational aspects not just for entertainment. After all, play as the basis of games has inherent learning aspects, for example seen at the way how children play and learn. The serious games movement that took o at the beginning of the 21st century wants to achieve exactly that: provide playful learning environments and utilize the motivational aspects of games to transport serious content to players. Getting from such an idea to an actual game, however, is far from trivial. A fundamental problem is how to integrate serious content and game parts. Finding ways how to improve the game creation process to produce applications that are both fun to play and e ective in delivering a serious content is the main focus of this thesis. Therefore, the problem is approached in two ways: by providing best practice tips for the creators of serious games and by presenting results of di erent practical game implementations and studies. Two sets of serious games — seven in total — have been developed within the course of this thesis. The rst set comprises games with static serious content. These games depict the regular development approach. Here, a static game concept is created and implemented by professional game developers. This approach allows for a high degree of freedom in the game creation process. Nevertheless, emphasis has to be put on combining serious content in the right way to produce e ective and fun serious games. Best practice tips are given along with presenting results from user studies that are based on the implemented game prototypes. The second set of games features dynamic learning content. In contrast to static variants, these games support changing the learning content at runtime. This allows for more accessible creation methods: Once created, any domain expert can create own custom games without the need for expertise in game development. On the other hand, special emphasis has to be put on designing the frameworks in a manner that game scenario and learning content are well integrated, despite not having a thematic connection. Di erent approaches are examined by developing games with dynamic content. The games are evaluated in terms of their usefulness. Di erent user studies look at the motivational aspects as well as at the learning outcome. Furthermore, the e ect of not having a connection between game scenario and learning content is examined to compare the e ectiveness of static and dynamic variants.	best practice;dynamic web page;run time (program lifecycle phase);subject-matter expert;usability testing;video game developer;video game development	Philip Mildner	2016			non-cooperative game;video game design;combinatorial game theory;game design;simulation;turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games;computer science;win-win game;artificial intelligence;emergent gameplay;game mechanics;game art design;metagaming;repeated game;game developer;multimedia;screening game;simulations and games in economics education;sequential game;game testing	HCI	-66.80119456348926	-41.64653153258465	50840

Play has an important role in child development with many potential contributions to therapy, education and enjoyment. The project investigates how robotic toys can become social mediators, encouraging children with disabilities to discover a range of play styles, from solitary to social and cooperative play (with peers, carers/teachers, parents etc). This paper presents design issues for such robotic toys related specifically to children with autism as the end user target group. In order to understand the play needs of this user group, and to investigate how robotic toys could be used as a play tool to assist in the children's development, a panel of experts (therapists, teachers, parents) was formed and interviewed. Results of the expert panel interview s highlight key points characterizing the play of children with autism, and key points for consideration in the design of future robotic toys.	dyadic transformation;first-order logic;orthogonal polarization spectral imaging;refinement (computing);requirement;requirements elicitation;robot;toys	Ben Robins;Nuno Otero;Ester Ferrari;Kerstin Dautenhahn	2007	RO-MAN 2007 - The 16th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication	10.1109/ROMAN.2007.4415061	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;robotics;child development	Robotics	-64.32195334611924	-42.492705364208895	50940

The equipment comprising the simulator is controlled by a computer system running the program OLE (Oceanography and LEarning), which was developed originally as a research tool in Chemical Oceanography (under Windows environment). Later, on the initiative of several teachers, the handling of the simulator was simplified to allow its use as a didactic resource for teaching the various processes that take place in littoral systems. Since its initial development, many different natural environmental conditions have been simulated, and the behaviour of many chemical pollutants has been studied. On the basis of this favourable experience, the simulator designed appears to be a versatile tool that can be usefully employed in both academic learning and research work. 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

3ab43b3f609165096560a113daa8d8d03a5c560f	how to aggregate lesson observation data into learning analytics datasets?		The technological environment that supports the learning process tends to be the main data source for Learning Analytics. However, this trend leaves out those parts of the learning process that are not computer-mediated. To overcome this problem, involving additional data gathering techniques such as ambient sensors, audio and video recordings, or even observations could enrich datasets. This paper focuses on how the data extracted from the observations can be integrated with data coming from activity tracking, resulting in a multimodal dataset. The paper identifies the need for theoretical and pedagogical semantics in multimodal learning analytics, and examines the xAPI potential for the multimodal data gathering and aggregation. Finally, we propose an approach for pedagogy-driven observational data identification. As a proof of concept, we have applied the approach in two research works where observations had been used to enrich or triangulate the results obtained for traditional data sources. Through these examples, we illustrate some of the challenges that multimodal dataset may present when including observational data.	aggregate function;ambient occlusion;computer-mediated communication;data aggregation;multimodal interaction;multimodal learning;sensor	Maka Eradze;María Jesús Rodríguez-Triana;Mart Laanpere	2017				ML	-66.6060617303904	-39.08335038029866	50966

Along with this exponential evolution, the learner plays a central role in both traditional and computer-assisted learning. Accordingly, the learner's individual differences have a remarkable potential to improve his/her performance and motivation. This is ensured by providing an adaptive learning support. The present paper presents a survey of learner modeling in adaptive E-learning systems while describing the main methods for extracting of the personalization parameters. The learner's modeling does not only interest researchers and developers, but also pedagogues, course' designer and tutors.	interactivity;interoperability;natural deduction;performance;personalization;time complexity;web page	Fedia Hlioui;Nadia Aloui;Faïez Gargouri	2016	2016 IEEE/ACS 13th International Conference of Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA)	10.1109/AICCSA.2016.7945770	computer science;personalization;adaptive system;adaptive learning;machine learning;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;information and communications technology	Robotics	-80.6891898340281	-44.81626470323231	50971

However, asking questions might also scaffold the learning process and thus influence the exact processes one wants to study. In the study described in this paper two groups of learners performed a computerized self-directed inductive learning task in which they conducted experiments to discover the relations between five independent variables and one dependent variable. In one condition, the learners thought aloud, in the other the learners were asked additional standardized questions pertaining to specific reasoning steps during learning. Measures of learning outcome and learning processes were collected. It appeared that the questions did not influence learning outcome. With respect to learning processes no differences were found, except that learners in the no questioning condition more often repeated experiments.

The commonly accepted guidelines for web accessibility (WCAG 1.0) were published in 1999 and have been extensively used by designers, evaluators and legislators. W3C-WAI published a new version of these guidelines (WCAG 2.0) in December 2008. One of the main goals of WCAG 2.0 was testability, that is, WCAG 2.0 should be either machine testable or reliably human testable. In this paper we present an educational experiment performed during an intensive web accessibility course. The goal of the experiment was to assess the testability of the 25 level-A success criteria of WCAG 2.0 by beginners. To do this, the students had to manually evaluate the accessibility of the same web page. The result was that only eight success criteria could be considered to be reliably human testable when evaluators were beginners. We also compare our experiment with a similar study published recently. Our work is not a conclusive experiment, but it does suggest some parts of WCAG 2.0 to which special attention should be paid when training accessibility evaluators.	software testability;web accessibility initiative;web content accessibility guidelines;web page	Fernando Alonso;José L.

Yet, older adults have been shown to have difficulty learning to use these devices. In the research presented in this article, we sought to better understand how older adults learn to use mobile devices, their preferences and barriers, in order to find new ways to support them in their learning process. We conducted two complementary studies: a survey study with 131 respondents from three age groups (20--49, 50--64, 65+) and an in-depth field study with 6 older adults aged 50+. The results showed, among other things, that the preference for trial-and-error decreases with age, and while over half of older respondents and participants preferred using the instruction manual, many reported difficulties using it. We discuss implications for design and illustrate these implications with an example help system, Help Kiosk, designed to support older adults’ learning to use mobile devices.	addendum;carroll morgan (computer scientist);digital library;field research;mobile computing;mobile device;owner's manual;smartphone	Rock Leung;Charlotte Tang;Shathel Haddad;Joanna McGrenere;Peter Graf;Vilia Ingriany	2012	TACCESS	10.1145/2399193.2399195	simulation;computer science;operating system;mobile device;multimedia	HCI	-63.427851986045034	-43.57202860253118	51448

We based the success of on-line collaborative discussion on two crucial aspects: first, by providing an adequate dialogue structure and move types that promote meaningful contributions and achieve more effective interaction; second, by extracting relevant knowledge in order to provide learners and tutors with efficient awareness, feedback, and monitoring as regards learners’ performance and collaboration. To this end, we employ a sociolinguistic model that builds a structure of the discussion through generic exchange types whereas it identifies a sufficient set of move types that users can use to contribute effectively to an on-line asynchronous discussion activity. Then these move types are used as indicators to analyze learners’ interactions and let them and their tutors be aware of their behaviour and performance as well as of the particular skills exhibited during interaction. The ultimate goal is to achieve a more effective support and assessment of the discussion process and to enhance learning. To validate this model, a real virtual learning environment is employed to support collaborative activities based on asynchronous discussion.	direction finding;fault tolerance;functional requirement;interaction;interoperability;iteration;knowledge management;non-functional requirement;online and offline;prototype;reliability engineering;scalability;single point of failure	Santi Caballé;Fatos Xhafa	2009	IJBIDM	10.1504/IJBIDM.2009.026907	collaborative learning;educational technology;simulation;computer science;knowledge management;knowledge engineering;feedback;multimedia;knowledge extraction;virtual learning environment	HCI	-79.2662046064715	-48.36946701222275	51476

The outcome variables were perceived satisfaction, decision confidenece, immediacy, effectiveness, and system ease of use. The role of communication medium and individual characteristic, specifically gender, on perception differences was explored. The results lend support to the argument that perception of communication outcomes differs by CMC medium, gender, and group gender composition status. Specifically there were medium effects for all the five outcome variables. Gender effect was found for three of the variables, which consist of perceived immediacy, decision confidence, and effectiveness. Interaction of medium and gender, and group composition status effects were also found for these three variables. The results also provide some support to the notion that perception changes over time. The discussion addresses implications for mixed gender group and CMC interaction.		B. A. Olaniran	1995	Inf.

However, most projects still fail to be successful with regard to key performance indicators (KPI). There is a growing understanding that human computer interaction is a key factor for the successful use of mobile devices in practice. However, it is still unclear how interfaces can be designed according to the specific needs of a user applying mobile devices in a business context. In this study we show that user experience has a strong impact on efficient human computer interaction. We present the results of a usability study on a mobile tool for IT-Service technicians.

This study examined the performance data of seven cohorts of students (N = 1168) learning programming under three different pedagogical approaches. These pedagogical approaches varied either in the length of the introductory programming block of courses (two or three semesters) or in the programming tool used in the first semester (C language or the programming support tool Raptor). In addition, gender and initial course selection differences were investigated. Raw pass rates under the three pedagogical approaches were compared; they were also compared, controlling for initial ability levels, using a logistic regression. Results showed that a more extensive duration of the introductory block produced a higher pass rate in students, but changing the programming tool used did not. Raw gender differences were not statistically significant; admission phase differences were initially statistically different, but not once initial ability and pedagogical approach received had been accounted for. Findings are discussed in relation to existing literature.	american and british english spelling differences;inferential theory of learning;kerrison predictor;logistic regression;population;programming tool;software performance testing	Gabriela Silva-Maceda;Pedro David Arjona-Villicana;Francisco Edgar Castillo-Barrera	2016	IEEE Transactions on Education	10.1109/TE.2016.2535207	mathematics education;simulation;computer science;multimedia	HCI	-81.20242334757125	-38.9746047056906	51652

The Open University’s Business School, in collaboration with the BBC mounted the project, called The Business Café. The paper outlines the contents of the nine broadcasts and the site, which changed weekly. Developing the broadcasts and maintaining the site required complex procedures and teamwork. The broadcasts attracted an audience of 300,000 UK viewers and the Web site recorded over 60,000 visits during the series. The stakeholders and others who offered much constructive criticism, identified more project outcomes during an evaluation. Useful lessons emerged, in particular about cross-team working and about learning from asynchronous networks like the Web. Web site: http://www.open.ac.uk/businesscafe Why have a Business Cafe? In early 1999, the Open University’s project, The Business Café, was in full swing. It was probably the first attempt by a large European business school to combine synchronous broadcast television with asynchronous networking over the Internet. This paper describes what happened during this exciting venture. But why have a Business Café? The Open University (commonly known as the OU) has a Business School that teaches 25,000 students at a distance in European and other countries. Many of its high quality courses include online components, as well as print materials, broadcasting (through the BBC) and face-to-face seminars. But the School’s environment is rapidly changing. For example, students’ access to online educational resources is increasing as telecommunication links improve. It is also true that television networks, including the BBC, face stiff competition from other providers of information, entertainment and education. The Business School noticed opportunities for linking the BBC’s broadcasting to interactive Web sites for distance learning. The Business Café was the School’s first project in this field. As in many countries, partnerships are seen as a key to success for educational institutions. Since 1969, the OU has commissioned the BBC to make and broadcast its television and radio. This broadcasting on national channels that are also available on cable in Continental Europe has created a large non-student audience and greatly raised the OU’s profile among the general public. Through the OU-BBC partnership, the OU is now being seen as a distinctive educational broadcaster meeting the needs of a wide audience, well beyond its own students. Instead of all the BBC’s television and radio for the OU being tied closely to courses for OU students, as they used to be, some series, such as The Business Café, are now aimed at wider audiences too. Inside the OU, the Business School has to bid for broadcast slots. It must have a clear idea of what it wants, based on an understanding of its various audiences. The School set aside funds for several projects during 1999 to provide data for strategic decisions about future broadcasts. The Business Café was the first. How it was conceptualised? The Business Café concept The opportunity arose for the Business School to create with the BBC a series of magazine-style business television broadcasts linked to an advanced interactive Web site. This concept was labelled “integrated broadcasting”, the idea being that television viewers would be drawn to the Web site, and the Web site would add value to their viewing of the broadcasts by offering further knowledge and a chance to collaborate with other viewers. The School saw the series as likely to enhance its teaching and research reputation. The makers of The Business Café set out to broadcast the School’s expertise in specific management areas: academics were responsible for the content and the BBC focused on creating engaging and informative television. Both the BBC and the School planned to digitise and index everything made for the series, so that it could be cannibalised for other purposes afterwards. The School wanted to reach hundreds of thousands of British and Continental European public and private sector managers interested in “business” and “management”, plus the School’s 30,000-strong community of students, alumni, tutors (sometimes called mentors), clients and partners. This project was developed in a rapidly changing organisational climate, during huge changes in staffing at the BBC Production Centre on the OU campus at Milton Keynes. In fact, a great deal was innovative about this project. Although the School and the BBC are very successful at producing high quality television and video series—and interactive CD-ROMs—for management courses taught at a distance, the partnership had never produced television broadcasts for a general business audience. In addition, although the School was used to providing online conferencing facilities for social and learning purposes within the 6,000 strong MBA student community, the OU had not tried out a linked, open-to-anyone discussion Web site. Our intention was to develop a high content Web site that was as dynamic and lively as the TV broadcasts and hence changed week on week to reflect the content of the broadcasts. The Web site would offer a second chance to watch extracts from the broadcasts 92 British Journal of Educational Technology Vol 32 No 1 2001 © British Educational Communications and Technology Agency, 2001. (or a first chance for those outside the broadcast range) and then draw in the viewercum-browser to look at additional resources on the site, and to engage in online discussions with others. We felt that text-based briefings, specially produced, on the main topic from each programme, written by OUBS academics in an accessible style but well argued and referenced, would offer browsers a chance to explore issues that were dealt with more superficially in the TV broadcasts. We felt that if a TV programme engaged a viewer’s interest, they might take their first steps in exploring the WWW through following the links around the topic that we presented on the Web site. Most of all, we hoped that viewers-cum-browsers would be willing to exchange information with other visitors to the site, stimulated by the topics on the TV broadcasts. We decided to focus the Web site on the main topic for each week’s TV broadcast in order to maximise and extend the learning potential. Therefore the Web links, the specially written texts and one of the video clips were produced around the main filmed case study and discussion in the Café. In addition, we decided that the book review item on each week’s programme would be video streamed as we felt that viewers might have read the book and would offer their own views on the online conferencing. We also provided a link to Amazon for book ordering, thus demonstrating a Web e-commerce application. Publicity for the series was put in the hands of the School’s PR agency, Grayling. The School knew that the Web site could probably provide data on its visitors—and feedback on the project. The broadcasts The Business Café set was created in an office high in Tower 42, overlooking the City of London. The series of nine broadcasts was broadcast on a national network (BBC2) on Sunday mornings, 7.45 to 8.15 am, during February, March and April, 1999. Each broadcast was presented by Winifred Robinson, normally a business presenter on radio. Each included a main feature plus regular short items. The nine main features, chosen to match the School’s research expertise, were: e-commerce, intellectual capital, social entrepreneurship, innovation, knowledge management, family values in business, risk and the twenty-first century manager. Each week the feature was introduced through brief discussion in the Café between Winifred Robinson, an academic from the School, and another outside expert, then explored further through filmed “case study” style reports. Afterwards, back in the Café, academics and other professionals discussed issues in the feature. The regular short items included a weekly taxi ride during which a business figure in the news was asked to describe his or her most important decision whilst riding through London in a black cab. Another short item was an “office of my own”: viewers were taken on a quick tour of an office, where they saw how different organisations and individuals are using their office space. In each broadcast Winifred Robinson discussed briefly with a reviewer a The Business Café Project 93 © British Educational Communications and Technology Agency, 2001. recent book on management. Finally, she ended the broadcast by asking one of the School’s best-known professors about what happened that week on the London Stock Exchange—and what might happen next! To promote the Web site, the URL was regularly shown on screen. Winifred Robinson also invited viewers to take part by visiting the site, and she summarised interesting messages received during the previous week. The Web site This is what the Web site at http://www.open.ac.uk/businesscafe looked like at the start. The site contained many items: • The week’s main feature. This discussion and the case studies with it were streamed onto the site as video. There was a link to the Microsoft MediaPlayer Web site for downloading the video player if needed. • The week’s book review was streamed as video too. • The conferencing area, where discussions were promoted by e-moderators— people with experience of running online conferences.

At the moment, there are more than 1 million EduCitizens registered in EduCities. 2,000 schools (more than half of schools in Taiwan) have built their EduTowns (smaller version of EduCities) and 18,000 classes are running their EduVillages. But these figures only represent an infrastructure, a bare skeleton, of a future network learning society. Based on the authors' work on EduCities, they argue that a network learning society will not be a 'tribal' learning society or a learning ecology, as portrayed by John Seely Brown in his keynote at ICCE98. Instead, it will be a 'structured' learning society. This structure mimics the current real world society we are used to today. The essence of the power of network is connectivity - connecting people, physical objects, information repositories, almost everything in the world. The question is how we use this network capability to link the old social structure, and from that, cultivate and diffuse learning elements into this structure, and expand the structure to form a larger but connected learning society. These strategies and actions taken are what we call the social design of a network learning society. If network learning is a learning ecology, then it must evolve around an existing structure.	bare-metal restore;ecology;social structure	T M Vanessa Chan	2002	International Conference on Computers in Education, 2002.

The authors apply microanalytical procedures (i.e. analysis of small segments and sections of log files) to the analysis of log files of the OhioLINK electronic journal service. The authors demonstrate an analysis based on extracted sub-network information and argue that these names can be interpreted as departmental (subject) names. They present an analysis between journal subject groupings and departments based on sub-network labels and find a degree of correlation between department name and subject of journal use. Further, the authors break down journal usage by sub-network label information. The analyses show that sub-network names reflect the physical location of the computer. This presents another possibility of analysing what journals are being used by which academic department.	data logger;log analysis	Paul Huntington;David Nicholas;M. R.

It is realised that the main problem of most of today's ITSs is that they still lack the collaboration and co-operation aspects in a real life classroom. The SQL Tutor+, a co-operative ITS with repository support, is able to provide such collaboration and co-operation services to both students and teachers. The SQL Tutor+ architecture consists of three layers, the educational agent layer, the knowledge server layer and the repository layer. The repository supplies a centralised storage and meta-level services pertaining to meta level information, such as management, evolution, operation and maintenance in a particular intelligent system. Such meta-level services include the capability for partial querying, meta-level browsing, and semantic-based searching. By deploying repository technology, our architecture provides the means for multiple educational agents to conduct co-operative and collaborative interactions.

Not only technology is shaping the content delivery and other collaborative frameworks but imposing limits on what could be achieved. One factor is the maximum number of users collaborating with each other with an acceptable QoS given a particular mobile network infrastructure. There has been considerable work on suggestions of distributed architectures that could be scalable with the number of users. Most of them are web based and on fixed workstations whereby mobility is completely absent. In this paper we are discussing the roadmap to a massive multiplayer game framework that would enable a large number of mobile learners to interact through an exciting large scale game	digital distribution;game engine;noise shaping;quality of service;scalability;workstation	Nawaz Mohamudally	2006	2006 Fourth IEEE International Workshop on Wireless, Mobile and Ubiquitous Technology in Education (WMTE'06)	10.1109/WMTE.2006.261338	mobile search;simulation;computer science;distributed computing;multimedia	Mobile	-68.34094760897156	-40.695648903077974	51983

Leaning to read is important for a citizen to participate and development in modern society with internet heavily used. However, it might not be an easy task for aged and cognitive impaired minority groups learn to adapt. The basic demographics of adult literacy will help to construct the amelioration program to promote learning to read. This study aimed to develop the Online Reading Literacy Assessment on Life Information (ORLALI). Methods: According to design of PISA, Retrieving information, interpretation and reflection/evaluation are designed into the ORLALI with 3 domains, 16 items with total score of 18. Pretest will be executed in 100 adults with contents validation and norm establishment. 500 adults will be recruited to validate the psychometric characteristics. 100 stroke patients with mild severity and 100 adults from community learning programs will be matched to explore the difference and the impact of cognitive impairment on literacy. Results: ORLALI will be well designed with good reliability and validity. Adult literacy will be less intact in mild stroke patients with negative correlation to cognitive impairment.

These new communication tools and strategies can radically change some specific work processes in communities, such as the work processes of an autarchy. Some authors emphasize the advantages of using Web 2.0 tools in autarchies; thus, we were interested in exploring the possibilities and constraints of implementing these tools in our region of Portugal, the Minho. Using a case study methodology, we aimed to find out about the possibilities of implementing Web 2.0 tools in autarchies through exploring the interest and motivation of autarchic collaborators in their use (our unit of analysis in autarchies). Information was gathered with the help of a questionnaire, the design of which was based on previous exploratory interviews and applied to four autarchic units in the Minho region. In each unit, three different target-groups were surveyed (Councilors, Information Systems (IS) Technicians, and General Staff), so that we could triangulate the data. Data analysis and results emphasized the interest and motivation of the autarchies in using Web 2.0 tools, as well as the main constraints that would be faced during Web 2.0 implementation. It also allowed us to establish some guidelines for adequate Web 2.0 implementation, including an “ideal” profile of the person responsible for the implementation process.	blog;e-government;emergence;flickr;information system;interaction;mashup (web application hybrid);podcast;rss;web 2.0;wiki;world wide web	Rui Gomes;Ligia de Sousa	2012	Future Internet	10.3390/fi4040882	web standards;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;social semantic web;multimedia;management;web 2.0;world wide web;computer security	HCI	-65.89848723517494	-35.39497644475769	52059

The main problem facing the system is the physical implementation of the video surveillance unit for remote monitoring of a student, as well as development of a decision making mechanism based on such monitoring. The monitoring would need to take place in conditions of widely available broadband Internet access and the use of a webcam. A possible solution is a model of the remote control described in this paper, which could solve this problem and make the system more reliable. The model is based on built-in elements and algorithms for visual recognition and motion tracking of the student, sound tracking, user (teacher) interface for assessing the validity of testing and of the system's kernel responsible for assessing the validity of the tests and reporting. The model is envisaged to be implemented accordingly to the wishes and needs of users, and can be integrated as a part of an integral e-learning environment. Although the model described is in principle technologically feasible, its practical realization requires professional refinement and experimental validation. Only by in-depth testing and experiences gained from the actual application of the system will be possible to identify all deficiencies and requirements that currently cannot be predicted.	algorithm;autonomous robot;autonomous system (internet);closed-circuit television;internet access;refinement (computing);remote control;requirement;web application;webcam;z-buffering	Damir Purkovic;Eugen Ban	2014	2014 37th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)	10.1109/MIPRO.2014.6859692	computer vision;simulation;computer science;video tracking;multimedia	Robotics	-78.9202539289606	-44.87549846280249	52064
82a13c83ceea3e6b85c0daf74e3c501965dab8d2	education for all: remote testing system with gesture recognition and recording		Abstract—Etymologically, in Latin expresses educare, that means to bring out, or be engaged in the infinite process of learning to present to the society as a valuable citizen. However, unfortunately especially in third world countries, education cannot be achieved due to, lack of inorganic and organic resources. However, many third world countries have embraced the concepts such as One Laptop per Child, facilitating the students to learn. The effective adaptation of these concepts has being launched through many government and non-government projects, providing inorganic resources. However, inorganic resources alone cannot provide quality education, as learning needs assessment procedures, feedback generators and trainers who could guide the students to gain knowledge.	gesture recognition;international standard serial number;laptop;prototype;requirement;software as a service;user interface;web 2.0	Rivindu Perera	2012	CoRR		simulation;human–computer interaction;telecommunications;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;multimedia;world wide web;computer security	HCI	-70.23764175447927	-38.73252299741968	52090

In the current work, adults learned four new action sequences, each via a different slideshow type. The computer advanced slides automatically, but each version had a different pausing mechanism: (1) free pause (viewers could click the mouse at any point to pause the show), (2) subgoal pause (show paused after subgoals, viewer clicked to continue), (3) timed pause (show paused every 20 slides, viewer clicked to continue), and (4) no pause (no viewer interaction). Participants completed a written memory test, live performance test, cognitive load measures, and satisfaction measures. Results indicated that memory recall was significantly lower in the no pause version when compared to the versions with pause capability. Also, over half of participants reported that the no pause version was their least favorite format to learn from. Conversely, over half of participants selected the free pause as their favorite slideshow format, and participants reported that they felt most in control of the free pause version. These reports occurred in spite of only one-quarter of all participants actually using the click-to-pause feature in the free pause slideshow. Perhaps the mindset of being in control, rather than the pausing itself, increased likeability of the program. This research has implications for program design and education, pointing to flexible pacing features being helpful in enhancing users' enjoyment of the program and ability to extract novel information. Memory is better after viewing slideshows with some pausing function.Learners reported liking the slideshow without pause capability the least.Learners reported liking the slideshow with a click-to-pause feature the best.The mindset of being in control seemed to be particularly beneficial.Flexible design and blended user/computer control are optimal for screen learning.

While educational research and teacher education are often seen as two separate facets of the work of computing education groups, we suggest combining these two aspects into a coherent whole more intensively. To foster this integration we conceptualize a school lab at the university, in which pre-service computing teachers can experience teaching high school students as well as educational research. In this paper we derive our concept from the debate about challenges to teacher education and educational research, and subsequently discuss it from these two perspectives.

A wide variety of instruments preceded the introduction of this new electronic tool: chisel, quill, pen, printing press, and typewriter. Two kinds of change are associated with these changes of instruments : the writing product is affected by these tools and humans have also to adapt to the new demands created by these inventions (Ong, 1982). The word processor introduces new features and brings new problems , and at the same time eliminates traditional writing behaviour that was molded most recently by handwriting, the printing press, and the Word processing may provoke unexpected outcomes of which not even the user is aware (Ragsdale, 1988). Because the use of word processing is spreading so quickly among individuals and organizations, the effects of this 22 tine Behaviour: e Interacti tool are felt by users and non-users alike (Teles, 1988). Most research on word processing and writing has been conducted with student populations (Hubert, 1985; Teles, 1988). The focus of this study is on the impact of word processing on the interaction between faculty and their secretaries, particularly in the domain of writing behaviour. Faculty and secretaries, as experienced writers, have writing habits different from those of students. 1 .1.

In the study, initially, learning objects were prepared in three different ways in relation to Visual-Auditory-Kinesthetic (VAK) learning style for each subject of the probability unit. These were appropriate for secondary school mathematics curricula. Then, they were transferred into the digital environment. Each student may follow a different course, and the solution supports s/he will get may also differ highlighting the individual learning. The sample of the study consists of 81 10th grade students from two high schools in Trabzon, Turkey. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from students to answer research questions. Quantitative data were given as frequency distribution and percentages. Qualitative data were analyzed using qualitative data analysis methods. Results of the study indicated that opinions regarding UZWEBMAT are rather positive. Aiming at individual learning, UZWEBMAT provides the most appropriate environment for students. In addition, UZWEBMAT can be used as well to reinforce traditional classroom education.

We introduce the Error-Driven-Featuring design pattern for teaching using features and labels in which a teacher prefers to introduce features only if they are needed. We analyze the potential risks and benefits of this teaching pattern through the use of teaching protocols, illustrative examples, and by providing bounds on the effort required for an optimal machine teacher using a linear learning algorithm, the most commonly used type of learners in interactive machine learning systems. Our analysis provides a deeper understanding of potential trade-offs of using different learning algorithms and between the effort required for featuring and labeling.	algorithm;machine learning;software design pattern	Christopher Meek;Patrice Y.

9b9c89524e55963ec10324fb29734e4723cac674	a notation for sets, sequences and series - possible benefits for understanding and use		The use of a well-designed and uniform notational system is imperative to improve communication and understanding. Currently, a fairly consistent notational system is used to notate the elements of sets, but the notations for sequences, series and other quantifications often vary from one author to another. The most widely used notation for sets has limitations and cannot easily be generalised to sequences and series. Furthermore, the well-known sigma notation for series is ambiguous and difficult to grasp. This article proposes a clear notation that can be used for all of the above. We aim to test the hypothesis that this notation could aid an understanding of concepts which build on the use of this notation. As a first step, we conducted a pilot study to inform the design of an experiment to evaluate the effect of the proposed notation on understanding. Secondary-school learners who had never been exposed to the sigma notation participated in the pilot study.

Clarity, cultural equivalence and relevance of the instrument were classified by seven experts. Forty-five students confirmed the ease of understanding in a pre-test. At scale-level index, the “Goal Setting” value was below the adequate level. Three items were considered unacceptable, and one of them was identified as a potentially problematic item. Confirmatory factor analysis showed some problems in the adjustment of the questionnaire model to the data. Self-regulated learning skills of Russian engineering students in MOOCs are moderate, with high levels in terms of “Environment Structuring” and “Goal Setting”, but low in “Help Seeking”.

Before programs development, the style of leisure and tourist destination of the Deaf in Poland were recognized using questionnaire interviews; for comparison, the same questions were asked to a control group of hearing. Besides texts, maps, pictures, pictograms, the programs include PJM animation module, borrowed from Thetos translation program. PJM users repeatedly tested the programs, i.a. on selected tourism routes. The PJM and the tourism industry experts also reviewed them. Feedback from the Deaf environment is currently used to improve programs – to complement vocabulary and animation expression (including facial expressions of avatar-translator).

Designing a participatory educational experience where users are able to actively interface and experience given subject matter in a practical experiential manner can enhance the user's ability to learn and retain presented information. Such natural gesture user interfaces have potential for broad application in disciplines ranging from systems engineering education to process simulation. This paper will discuss progress on the development of testing environments for interactive educational methods in conjunction with artificial intelligent systems that have the ability to adjust the educational user experience based on individual user identification. This will be achieved through depth sensor skeletal tracking, allowing experience adaptation based on the nature and effectiveness of the interactive educational experience.	sensor	Brian Moriarty;Elizabeth Lennon;Frank DiCola;Kyle Buzby;Morisa Manzella;Emily Hromada	2012		10.1016/j.procs.2012.09.054	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;artificial intelligence;multimedia	SE	-68.03279205267569	-43.17663871419853	52665

Therefore, based on the scaffolding concept, this study proposes a design scheme of the Virtual Experiment Learning Activity for IPv6 (IPv6-VELA) to integrate learning materials for conceptual learning with virtual experiment for hands-on learning. Thereby, the trainee can learn the IPv6 upgrade knowledge in the step-by-step manner by means of the scaffolding learning supports, i.e., formative and summative diagnostic reports generated according to the learning portfolio. The experimental result also shows that the IPv6-VELA-based learning activity is beneficial for the trainee and teacher.

One of the major challenges for researchers is to develop methods to predict the behavior of students so that teachers and tutors are able to identify at-risk students as early as possible and provide assistance before they drop out or fail in their courses. Machine Learning models have been used to predict or classify students in these settings. However, while these models have shown promising results in several settings, they usually attain these results using attributes that are not immediately transferable to other courses or platforms. In this paper, we provide a methodology to classify students using only interaction counts from each student. We evaluate this methodology on a data set from two majors based on the Moodle platform. We run experiments consisting of training and evaluating three machine learning models (Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes and Adaboost decision trees) under different scenarios. We provide evidences that patterns from interaction counts can provide useful information for classifying at-risk students. This classification allows the customization of the activities presented to at-risk students (automatically or through tutors) as an attempt to avoid students drop out.	adaboost;decision tree;dropout (neural networks);experiment;machine learning;naive bayes classifier;support vector machine	Douglas Detoni;Cristian Cechinel;Ricardo Matsumura de Araújo;Daniela Francisco Brauner	2016	RITA		simulation;data science;machine learning	ML	-76.2325150751724	-49.808195570267664	52750

A major reason for that unfavorable state may be found in the fact that teachers lack sophisticated knowledge to support effective technology integration. This knowledge is indeed sophisticated as it, among other issues, calls for complex interplay involving three types of knowledge: content knowledge to teach, pedagogical knowledge to apply, and technology knowledge to empower the previous two. Because of this interplay, successful technology integration clearly requires teachers to develop a new body of knowledge, known under the name technological pedagogical content knowledge or just TPCK (Angeli & Valanides, 2009).

Such problems involve the building of physical and mathematical models of real-world scenarios, identifying correct parameters of the model, devising numerical solution methods, and optimizing the solution. In typical engineering courses, solution methods are demonstrated in problem-solving tutorials while programming is relegated to homework or lab, wherein students may not get ample feedback on their choices of optimization or solution evaluation. In this paper, we propose a strategy, Guided Problem Solving and Group Programming (GPGP) to overcome this gap. Students work in peer groups within class, to build and implement their mathematical models and solutions, then write programs to do optimization and evaluation. We implemented this strategy in a 4th year electrical engineering course in which GPGP was done four times over the semester. We assessed students' performance on dimensions of problem solving such as representing the problem, developing solution, making justification for proposed solution and monitoring and evaluating problem space and solutions across the semester and found a statistically significant improvement. Further students perceived that they had learned engineering problem solving via GPGP and reported enjoying the strategy in class.	electrical engineering;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;numerical partial differential equations;problem domain;problem solving	Abhinav Anand;Aditi Kothiyal;Bipin Rajendran;Sahana Murthy	2014	2014 IEEE Sixth International Conference on Technology for Education	10.1109/T4E.2014.10	mathematics education;simulation;applied mathematics;computer science	AI	-81.60661258331031	-37.226907800620474	52813
b8ed38e198274a6f80f425216142830b4bdb1dd3	computers in the cs1 classroom		There are two basic approaches to flipping an introduction to programming class (CS1). One involves requiring all students to bring computers to class and to work alone or in groups to solve programming problems. The other approach is to ban computers from the classroom and to require students to solve programming problems on paper. In both approaches the students’ attempts are shared with the class and discussed. In this work, we describe an experiment in which we compared these two approaches for a large programming class. We found that the use of computers had no statistically significant effect on the students’ learning outcomes, enjoyment of the material, self-assessment of their understanding, use of teaching assistant resources, or self-estimate of how many hours they invested outside of the classroom. We did find that a statistically significant number of students preferred problem solving with friends using computers rather than on paper. We also found that the instructor had much more detailed information about individual student’s interaction in class when computers were used, since all student interaction with the coding tools could be logged and analysed. We conclude that, although many faculty are wary of requiring computer use in large classes, there is evidence that students prefer it, it does not negatively affect learning outcomes, and with appropriate tools and pedagogy, it gives the instructor a much deeper and more nuanced view of student performance in the class.	computer;problem solving	William T.

24bb91651a56692a6cf5e4d4781d972c2cc9672f	identifying bullies with a computer game	social networks;ai and social sciences	Current computer involvement in adolescent social networks (youth between the ages of 11 and 17) provides new opportunities to study group dynamics, interactions amongst peers, and individual preferences. Nevertheless, most of the research in this area focuses on efficiently retrieving information that is explicit in large social networks (e.g., properties of the graph structure), but not on how to use the dynamics of the virtual social network to discover latent characteristics of the realworld social network. In this paper, we present the analysis of a game designed to take advantage of the familiarity of adolescents with online social networks, and describe how the data generated by the game can be used to identify bullies in 5th grade classrooms. We present a probabilistic model of the game and using the in-game interactions of the players (i.e., content of chat messages) infer their social role within their classroom (either a bully or non-bully). The evaluation of our model is done by using previously collected data from psychological surveys on the same 5th grade population and by comparing the performance of the new model with off-the-shelf classifiers.	experiment;interaction;naive bayes classifier;pc game;sensor;social network;statistical model;virtual world;with high probability	Juan Fernando Mancilla-Caceres;Wen Pu;Eyal Amir;Dorothy Espelage	2012			simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;social computing;social network	Web+IR	-68.22486411585035	-47.610454406544775	52859

The bilingual teaching of professional courses is different from the ordinary teaching of professional courses and the teaching of foreign language. Based on the bilingual teaching practice for several years, several classroom instruction patterns and teaching methods were proposed. Furthermore, how to apply these teaching patterns for classroom instruction was analyzed and researched comprehensively with a view to making students master professional knowledge and improve English skill.	teaching method;web resource	Xiaozhong Ren;Jianhai Han;Dongfang Hu	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-23339-5_22	mathematics education;computer science;multimedia;pedagogy	ML	-77.21932236848843	-41.61476222000336	52884

Goal: The goal of this research is to study the effects of using a collection of examples for creating a software design. Method: We ran a controlled experiment for evaluating the use of a broad collection of examples for creating software designs by software engineering students. In this study, we focus on software designs as represented through UML class diagrams. The treatment is the use of the collection of examples. These examples are offered via a searchable repository. The outcome variable we study is the quality of the design (as assessed by a group of experts). After this, all students were offered the opportunity to improve their design using the collection of examples. We ran a post-assignment questionnaire to collect qualitative data about the experience of the participants. Results: Considering six quality attributes measured by experts, our results show that: 1) the models of the students who used examples are 18% better than those of who did not use examples. 2) the models of the students who did not use examples for constructing became 19% better after updating their models using examples. We complement our statistical analysis with insights from the post assignment questionnaire. Also, we observed that students are more confident about their design when they use examples. Conclusion: Students deliver better software designs when they use a collection of example software designs.	class diagram;list of system quality attributes;software design;software engineering	Bilal Karasneh;Rodi Jolak;Michel R.

The topic chosen for learning was the Three States of Water. A quasi-experiment was conducted. In this experiment, students were divided into three groups: control group (without scaffolds), experimental group A (scaffolds providing by on-line conversation) and experimental group B (scaffolds providing by face-to-face conversation). The experimental results showed significant improvement for students after they had studied using the web-based, adaptive learning system. Specifically, scaffolds in the form of face-to-face conversations greatly enhanced the learning of high-achievement students. However, there were no significant differences between the low-achievement students with or without the provision of scaffolds. It was also discovered that the web-based, adaptive learning system could help students develop their learning responsibility.	experiment;online and offline;web application	Mei-Yu Chang;Wernhuar Tarng;Fu-Yu Shin	2009	IJWLTT	10.4018/jwbltt.2009091801	collaborative learning;cooperative learning;computer science;knowledge management;experiential learning;scaffold;communication;adaptive learning;pedagogy	AI	-76.66241788898927	-42.739620087357764	52933

This study describes the effects of three different interfaces on these informal channels. Interface design has a widely studied effect on user behavior, and new users often encounter barriers during accessing social media tools. Using a mixed methods approach, we collected and grouped 413 posts across three distinct interfaces of ResearchGate’s communication platform. Our results show that scholars were more polite in the initial group discussion interface but that user interface design did not change the core communication patterns of sharing information and opinions among scholars. The site also transitioned from one-to-many discussions to one-to-one posts, but new users were generally welcomed to the scholarly communications.	one-to-many (data model);one-to-one (data model);scholarly communication;social media;user interface design;world wide web	Spencer Goodwin;Wei Jeng;Daqing He	2014		10.1002/meet.2014.14505101129	human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia;user interface;world wide web	HCI	-65.77608162880196	-35.86359258750503	52936

Heavy emphasis is placed on team‐ and project‐management principles, team presentations, the application of standard structured development methodologies, and the generation of formal deliverables after each project phase. Project ideas are canvassed from faculty, graduate students, local industry and community, and from the students themselves. We believe that the knowledge and experience acquired by students from working in a team on a substantial project gives them an insight and perspective that is unattainable through the standard lecture paradigm. The course has received enthusiastic endorsement from industry, accrediting boards, and participating students (albeit at the end of the course!).		Thomas F. Hain;Stephen M.

Building empathy is a large theoretical underpinning of our program, and we emphasize participatory and collaborative design processes continually throughout our work. This means that our lab is really the real world. When students focused on solutions to aid the homeless in Austin, they spent time with people experiencing homelessness, caseworkers, legal counsel, businesses that are impacted by those living on the streets, neighbors, tourists, and on and on. A big part of the culture of homelessness in Austin is a weekly gathering called Church Under the Bridge, under Interstate 35, and so our students spent a great deal of time immersed in that event. Homeless individuals rely on public transport, and thus our students took public transport. By bringing the lab to the world, we hope to remove the clinical and reductionist approach to research in order to both understand and empathize with the messiness of systems, policies, and cultures. day IN the lab	reductionism	Jon Kolko	2013	Interactions	10.1145/2451856.2451877	multimedia;human–computer interaction;engineering	HCI	-66.71672378113495	-27.511328403148198	52959

However, our inquiries in online forums do not always generate knowledge desideratum satisfactorily. A few recent studies noticed that communication practices become a means to characterize online forums and influences on effectiveness of collaborative learning. Our preliminary case study in an enduring online forum showed that how dialogue unfolds, i.e., asking questions and suggesting hypothetical solutions, shapes different dynamisms of collaborative learning; some dialogues are highly generative, drawing broad attention, surfacing multiple voices, and producing new knowledge through active reflection, refinement, and exploration; but some fail to be generative and display narrow, inadequate inquiry. Given the importance of dialogue and structures of interaction for learning, we propose to study how different dialogue practices in online forums are related to different levels of generative inquiry.	americas conference on information systems;collective intelligence;computer-supported cooperative work;interaction;knowledge acquisition;refinement (computing);social structure;wicked	Yusun Jung;Richard J.

Due to these differences, it is hard for participants to mutually understand intentions, and they must make a lot of effort to reach a mutual agreement on the design. Thus, the efficiency of the design processes is decreased. We propose a framework to support participants in mutual understanding by grasping and showing the differences among their intentions in a collaboration. A system based on the proposed framework has the following characteristics: it facilitates mutual understanding among participants by presuming their intentions and by communicating them in an understandable form, it visualizes the differences in concepts among the participants, and it progresses the collaboration in an interactive way.

This study aims to report an empirical study on how four types of digital natives, all born in the 1980s, access information and create content. Data was collected through one-on-one semi-structured interviews with 28 writers, illustrators, social innovators, and makers in total, seven in each category. The data were then processed as follows: First, we employed qualitative analysis and interpretation through close readings and meaning-making. Second, we quantitatively deconstructed the text by atomizing the discourse with Chinese Knowledge and Information Processing (CKIP) and filtering out units that are irrelevant to the analysis. Finally, we generated comparisons among the four contemporary groups and their new literacy practices.	digital native;information processing;new literacies;relevance;semiconductor industry	Su-Yen Chen;Jason S.

This paper reviews literature, questions mobile and desktop versions of MOOCs, and provides a frame for their comparison.	desktop computer;massive open online course	Antonia Bralic;Maja Cukusic;Mario Jadric	2015	2015 38th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)	10.1109/MIPRO.2015.7160417	simulation;computer science;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-69.61448969730462	-39.76386675221429	53760

Data for this study were provided by 25 law students who were enrolled in a course in legal history at the University of Helsinki in February 2001. Both the students and the teacher were interviewed. The interviews showed that the students' experiences of the essay-writing process were very positive. The teacher's experiences were in line with the students'. The results showed that the students seemed to divide into two groups concerning their experiences towards sharing written drafts with peers: those who were very enthusiastic and enjoyed the possibility to share drafts and those who, on the other hand, felt that the idea of sharing unfinished essays was too threatening for them and required too much openness. The results further showed that the active use of a computer-supported learning environment was related to good essay grades.	collaborative network	Sari Lindblom-Ylänne;Heikki Pihlajamäki	2003	BJET	10.1111/1467-8535.d01-3	psychology;mathematics education;social science;computer science;assignment;feedback;sociology;higher education;management;law;pedagogy;technology	HPC	-76.5333241218387	-32.65171295304928	53782

It plays the key-enabling role in knowledge management for individual, schools, and enterprises. The most salient features of SCORM come from its goal, namely, reusability, accessibility, interoperability, and durability. One of the underlying mechanisms realizing the goal is metadata. However, dealing with complex metadata efficiently in a LMS is a tedious task for system developers. By cohering to interoperability SCORM-compliant course contents can run on different SCORM run-time environments, nevertheless, distributed LMSs could not communicate to each other; this hiders the content management and sharing. In this paper, we propose a hybrid scheme composed of an XML binding model and a LDAP-based directory service to overcome these two shortcomings. A preliminary experiment demonstrates its efficiency and effectiveness toward distributed management of SCORM-compliant course contents.	accessibility;directory service;durability (database systems);emergence;interoperability;knowledge management;lightweight directory access protocol;xml	Sheng-Tun Li;Chu-Hung Lin;Yuan-Chun Chang;Jin-Tan Yang	2004	19th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA'05) Volume 1 (AINA papers)	10.1109/EEE.2004.1287360	computer science;knowledge management;database;world wide web	HPC	-82.59414664607522	-44.35749011683034	53860

Designers, however, lack ways to ensure challenges are suitably tailored to the abilities of each game player, often resulting in player boredom or frustration. Challenge tailoring refers to the general problem of matching designer-intended challenges to player abilities. We present an approach to predict temporal player performance and select appropriate content to solve the challenge tailoring problem. Our temporal collaborative filtering approach-tensor factorization-captures similarities among players and the challenges they face to predict player performance on unseen, future challenges. Tensor factorization accounts for varying player abilities over time and is a generic approach capable of modeling many kinds of players. We use constraint solving to optimize content selection to match player skills to a designer-specified level of performance and present a model-performance curves-for designers to specify desired, temporally changing player behavior. We evaluate our approach in a role-playing game through two empirical studies of humans and one study using simulated agents. Our studies show tensor factorization scales in multiple game-relevant data dimensions, can be used for modestly effective game adaptation, and can predict divergent player learning trends.	collaborative filtering;constraint satisfaction problem;matching (graph theory);polystation	Alexander Zook;Mark O.

In addition, a number of environmental factors, including temperature and ambient light levels, can also contribute to alertness and neurobehavioral performance. In these studies, data were collected on the sleep patterns of university students and the ambient conditions in classrooms, dormitories and other academic environments to which these students were habitually exposed. Thirty-eight engineering undergraduates were monitored using wrist actigraphy to measure sleep, waking and light exposure. Data were collected in 14-day increments and repeated three times during a college term. Preliminary analyses have been performed to characterize the habitual sleep and circadian conditions experienced by these subjects. Results suggest that college students are following sleep/wake schedules detrimental to the acquisition and retention of learned material. In effect, students may be subjected to schedules and lighting that physiologically impaired their ability to perform to high academic standards.	schedule (computer science)	Maurice Baynard;Donald McEachron	2011	2011 Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)	10.1109/FIE.2011.6142953	simulation;circadian rhythm	HCI	-75.27443702265887	-43.13224568544308	53945

As we enter 2007, there is increasing evidence that there is a healthy interest in maturity models and process improvement. Last year many new organisations have started looking at the maturity of their projects. Many of these organisations do not develop software, but are instead looking for deeper insights into their capability and productivity. They are interested in exploring the value of process improvement as an approach to improving performance. Software process improvement is an intensive and absorbing occupation. Practitioners grapple with cultural and organisational barriers and with active resistance from individuals while trying to change norms, habits, practices and procedures at the organisational level. The task is certainly demanding and all consuming. With maturity comes improvement. However, in the search for improvement and optimisation, it is all too easy to become insular and defensive by continuously looking inwards and to ignore lessons and perspectives that may not be immediately obvious. Indeed, is there a value in lessons that were not made here? Is it possible to learn from practitioners in other disciplines? Can we improve our own practice by watching other professionals ply their trade? Formula One racing offers many thrills to viewers and fans. But apparently it can also offer instructive lessons in process improvement.	capability maturity model;grapple;mathematical optimization;ply (game theory)	Darren Dalcher	2007	Software Process: Improvement and Practice	10.1002/spip.328	engineering	HPC	-63.84833726482006	-24.26745122931213	53982

ef9faf817803639749dc481cb60b0da37361b84c	identifying student communication strategies involving spatial information		Spatial ability and effective communication are considered important skills in the engineering and technology fields. However, little research has been done to assess how engineering or technology students communicate spatial information. Effective spatial information can help engineers and technologists describe their design, as well as how parts of a design are assembled into a final shape. In this study, researchers aimed at identifying strategies used between two peers, referred to as a dyad, as they communicate information to transform a 3D virtual model into a physical scale model. The focus of analysis is on the metacognitive strategies dyads used to identify difficulties in communication. A quasi-experimental design was used to observe the processes used by 6 dyads of graduate students from engineering technology and technology fields. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were used to identify common communication patterns and determine when participants decided on a change of communication strategy. Results show that only two out of six dyads reproduced the model correctly. Successful teams developed an assembly strategy prior to building and used task monitoring to check for misplaced pieces. Less successful teams relied more on repeated instructions to manage miscommunication.	3d modeling;design of experiments;geographic information system	Luciana Debs;Sean Brophy;Cecilia Espinoza	2017	2017 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)	10.1109/FIE.2017.8190582	visualization;knowledge management;sociology;spatial ability;metacognition;solid modeling;spatial analysis	HCI	-72.20685189682541	-41.95056570527789	54036

Yet, not enough attention has been paid to what role learners' profiles play in the use of social e-learning environments, which does not match the importance of profiles in SNS. This paper presents how profiles are implemented in the second version of Topolor, a social personalised adaptive e-learning environment (SPAEE), and learners' perceived acceptance of the design and the implementation. To complement the findings, a case study is conducted to analyze the profile-related features in Topolor, which illustrates a generally high level of learner acceptance of these features. The analysis is finally concluded to suggest future research directions, in order to further analyze and improve these features.	high-level programming language	Lei Shi;Alexandra I.

This paper explores some of these assumptions through the findings of a longitudinal study involving a cohort of over 800 university students. The study adopted a student perspective to examine the factors affecting their use of computers over a three year period. Unsurprisingly, the results indicated that situational factors (e.g. access, training and time) influence the extent to which students use computers, but a disparity was found in the importance attributed to these factors by the academic staff, who focused on the needs of their department, and by the students, who focused on their individual needs. Results suggest that increased attention to a student perspective may lead to improved strategic planning in students’ use of computers.	binocular disparity;computer	J. McMahon;John A. Gardner;C.

It describes SamEx mobile learning application design by focusing on the possibilities for self-directed learning and the role of virtual badges gathered by the students during their one year SamEx usage. All the activities were structured by the teachers and scaffolded by the SamEx system tools such as contextually triggered questions and prompts. The paper describes experiences from the one-year SamEx usage period, gives an elaborate example of students learning experience during the period, and concludes by examining the effects of such an approach when it comes to summative exam results. The paper concludes that platforms such as SamEx have the potential of nurturing self-directed and collaborative learning and that badges can only motivate students to learn meaningfully when the teachers provide the suitable learning contexts.

However, freedom of choice complicates course management and may deter instructors from allowing such freedom. Our approach is to utilize existing functionality of course management systems such as Moodle to automatically facilitate and coordinate free student choices and provide much needed relief for instructors at the same time. Using Moodle we have developed novel digital study packs that blend freedom of choice with guidance and control. Our survey shows that assisted freedom of choice is ranked highest in 51% of student responses -- in contrast to unlimited choice at 28% or no choice at all at 21%. Experience reported in this paper may be beneficial for instructors who would like to expand their courses with new motivational learning techniques.

The survey is grounded in our Game Elements-Attributes Model (GEAM). 321 valid responses were analysed using established hierarchical clustering methods and a novel mapping technique that computes the degree of relevance of individual game attributes to game types and visualises them with hues of grey. The game genre map so obtained can improve the existing game classification.	cluster analysis;degree (graph theory);hierarchical clustering;relevance;video game developer;web application	Stephanie Heintz;Effie Lai-Chong Law	2015		10.1145/2793107.2793123	game design;simulation;level design;computer science;game mechanics;game art design;game developer;multimedia;simulations and games in economics education;game design document;communication	AI	-64.96566444843889	-42.41806427887502	54422

In this paper, the strategy to change academic courses, the basic blocks of curriculum, of undergraduate programs at CETYS University, with a generic information literacy rubric for professors, is described. The rubric generated by a faculty and library committee offers guidelines on how to implement information fluency pedagogical approaches and add quality information resources to their syllabi.	information literacy	Jesús Lau;José Luis Bonilla;Alberto Gárate	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-14136-7_60	library science;simulation;engineering;pedagogy	Robotics	-79.29778110047782	-33.67768961902859	54458

PLATE-PBL is a Moodle plug-in based entirely on the meta-model of the PBL scripting language. The plug-in dynamically transforms lesson plans developed by a special visual script editor, it then interprets and instantiates equivalent lesson plans in the Moodle's runtime. Lesson plans can also be designed from within the Moodle plug-in using the same meta-model of the PBL scripting language. This is due in part to the use of Model Driven Architecture (MDA) paradigm in the development process.	applescript editor;metamodeling;model-driven architecture;plug-in (computing);programming paradigm;scripting language	Zeyad Ali;Disi Wang;Mohammed Samaka;Yongwu Miao	2016	2016 IEEE 16th International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT)	10.1109/ICALT.2016.101	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia;computational model	Robotics	-81.24544513974587	-44.08619473511873	54499

With a variety of tools and resources always available, mobile learning provides increased options for the personalization of learning. With access to so much content anytime and anywhere, there are plenty of opportunities for individual learning. However, each individual has his/her single way of learning. Students learn through several methods — by hearing, seeing, memorizing, visualising, reflecting and acting. Accordingly, some instructors demonstrate or discuss topics, focus on rules, give examples, or emphasize memory. For those reasons, adaptive mobile learning can personalize courses to meet individual needs. In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of a prototype tool called the Adaptive Mobile Learning System, which seeks to support students with a learning object, which is based on their needs. A total of 128 participants (90 female and 38 male) were selected for participation.	adobe flash lite;agent-based model;anytime algorithm;html5;mobile device;nokia 5800 xpressmusic;personalization;prototype;symbian;xml	Mohammed Abdel Razek;Hisham Jameel A.

Many institutions are at the crossroad whether or not to adopt web-based education (WBE). In many cases their survival may depend on how successfully they can adopt WBE. In this regard, they can learn from the early adopters of WBE and, from their experiences, both good and bad without reinventing the wheel. This paper has two specific purposes: the first, describe WBE diffusion at a upper level university in the U.S., and, the second, is to discuss its diffusion experiences so that other universities can benefit from it. This paper relates diffusion of innovation theory and the 4 â€œPâ€™sâ€ of marketing to discuss Web education diffusion. We feel this is a first attempt in this direction. This paper should be useful worldwide for universities planning to start WBE and are looking for some guidance on â€œhowâ€ , â€œwhereâ€ and â€œwhatâ€ to follow to initiate the process.		Anil K.

Eighteen fish species were presented either as videos or selected freeze-frames to students. Thereafter, students exercised identifying these species in their natural habitats during snorkeling. Students’ knowledge of biodiversity was measured from test videos before (posttest 1) and after (posttest 2) snorkeling as the number of recognized species. Results showed significant knowledge gains between posttest 1 and 2. For the presentation format (static vs. dynamic) there was no significant main effect. However, a significant interaction showed that the students` knowledge improved from posttest 1 to 2 to a larger extent in the dynamic group. The study was conducted within a university curriculum for which a mobile learning scenario using portable DVD-players was applied for the first time. Overall results indicate a high potential for using mobile devices in informal settings during field trips.	habitat;mobile device;situated;video	Vanessa D. I.

d50de85ddcc57cfc25e4a339a8e373a37ee2b360	information systems and technology education: perspectives from usa community colleges		According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, at least 57 percent of job openings in the United States (US) in 2006-2016 will require some post secondary education, jobs for community college graduates are expected to grow at twice the national average and the highest paying jobs will be in the Information Technology (IT) sector. Yet studies of preparation of IT professionals typically explore four-year institutions rather than community colleges. Given the percentage of the USA population that attends community college, exploring information systems and technology education in community colleges and students’ readiness for the IT workforce are important subjects to investigate. In this paper, community college students’ perceptions are examined to identify how students perceive the importance of specific IT skills, how confident students are about their ability to learn and engage with the specific IT skills, and how the gender of respondents affect gender stereotyping of these IT skills.	information system;jumpstart our business startups act;stereotype (uml)	Sadan Kulturel-Konak;Eileen M.

In spite of the growth, the high dropout rate in online learning has been of concern to many higher education institutions and organizations. The purpose of this study was to determine whether persistent learners and dropouts are different in individual characteristics (i.e., age, gender, and educational level), external factors (i.e., family and organizational supports), and internal factors (i.e., satisfaction and relevance as sub-dimensions of motivation). Quantitative data were collected from 147 learners who had dropped out of or finished one of the online courses offered from a large Midwestern university. Dropouts and persistent learners showed statistical differences in perceptions of family and organizational support, and satisfaction and relevance. It was also shown that the theoretical framework, which includes family support, organizational support, satisfaction, and relevance in addition to individual characteristics, is able to predict learners' decision to drop out or persist. Organizational 9upport and relevance were shown to be particularly predictive. The results imply that lower dropout rates can be achieved if online program developers or instrdctors find ways to enhance the relevance of the course. It also implies thai adult learners need to be supported by their organizations in order for them to finish online courses that they register for.	dropout (neural networks);level of measurement;online machine learning;relevance	Ji-Hye Park;Hee Jun Choi	2009	Educational Technology & Society		psychology;distance education;computer science;multimedia;social psychology;world wide web;pedagogy	ML	-76.07390622883402	-40.49381464736482	54599

Such approaches put forward the need for skills to constract the desired configuration, take into account the dependencies between its parameters, visualize positions of possible results, even """"see"""" the desired function, for which you need to determine extreme. The authors use GeoGebra in solving extreme problems using method based on constructing an empirical graph of the relations between the values and defining of extremum. Another method is based on the visualisation of spreadsheets of the values of the empirical function and their analysis. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was tested during 2015-2017 and was experimentally confirmed in the work on the research topic """"The use of information technology in education"""" through the organization of math group works for pupils in the Sumy region. We tracked the overall level of academic achievement and its dynamics.

We used the learning management system ILIAS in combination with the content management system Stud.IP. All students (N=225) were subjected to an introductory test (to assess knowledge prior to our teaching), a mid-term test and a final test to assess gain of knowledge. About 40% of students used the new eLearning tools. While there was no association between the use of quizzes and examination results, the usage of the learning module was accompanied by increased scores in exams (p<;0.05). Moreover, in a formalized evaluation system, students positively commented on our eLearning efforts. In summary, eLearning can increase performance in written tests and increase student satisfaction.	content management system	Joachim Neumann;Katja Rulf;Ulrich Gergs	2013	Proceedings of the 26th IEEE International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems	10.1109/CBMS.2013.6627833	education;simulation;computer science;multimedia;heart	SE	-78.2489867563049	-40.95040303848723	54823

With stiff competition among institutions using virtual worlds for education, a legitimate research question is: What factors influence students’ intention to adopt 3-D virtual world environment for their education needs? Drawing on existing technology acceptance models and studies in other IS contexts, we developed a model to predict students’ acceptance of a 3-D virtual world education environment and plan to empirically test the model using survey data collected from college students. From the academic research perspective, studies on the use of the new technology for education will provide insights on how virtual world environment contributes to virtual education that is now part of the mainstream of education. From the practitioner perspective, the study provides useful insights to educational institutions and assists institutions in evaluating whether investing in virtual world education is a sound strategy.	virtual world	Xiaofeng Chen;Keng Siau;Fiona Fui-Hoon Nah	2008			simulation;knowledge management;multimedia	HCI	-72.31371448417511	-39.91992432057879	54909

In this paper we develop an idea first mooted by Wilkinson, Ball, and Cooper (2010), which is that the dichotomy between theorybased and simulation-based reasoning in the context of mental state understanding is synonymous with the distinction between intuitive and reflective thinking in dual-process accounts of human reasoning (e.g., Evans, 2010). To support this proposal we draw upon a range of concepts and findings deriving from both mainstream reasoning research and from studies of social cognition. We also consider the implications of our proposal for the formulation of an integrative approach to understanding reasoning in all of its many manifestations, whether undertaken for the attainment of socially-oriented goals or for the purposes of learning and discovery.	mental state;simulation;social cognition	Meredith Wilkinson;Linden J.

Beside personal motivation and discipline, there are objective factors which limit the amount of available labor- atory time for students. To deal with the afore mentioned problem for electrical engineering and computer science courses teaching basic concepts of computer architecture at the undergraduate level, we have devised a pocket-size prototyp- ing system which can be controlled from any kind of computer device, here in- cluding contemporary mobile phones and tablets. The issue which we tackle in this paper is the efficient use of touchscreen devices to input assembly language code controlling the operation of the main processing unit on the prototyping system. The results of the pilot study performed, which addresses accuracy and time needed to accomplish the task, are rather encouraging, and shows that our special variant of virtual keyboard did not deteriorate students' performance when inputting assembly code.	assembly language;touchscreen	Mihael Kukec;Sandi Ljubic;Vlado Glavinic	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-39062-3_32	simulation;human–computer interaction;engineering;multimedia	HCI	-66.7728198403202	-45.73819070313668	54954

In addition, one such expert system will be proposed demonstrating how this data may be used to automate a common classroom management task that may improve students’ classroom experiences.	adobe streamline;educational data mining;experience;expert system;mined;social graph	Robert Olson;Zachary Daily;John Malayny;Robert Szkutak	2013			computer science;classroom management;machine learning;artificial intelligence;management science;social graph;systems engineering;expert system;educational data mining	HCI	-79.42797646900675	-39.39824337913503	54998
da93032483daeb76777699e95db85c9988ca1351	exploring factors affecting learner's perception of learning information and communication technology: a hlm analysis of a national farmers' training program in taiwan		The present study, pertaining to a national information literacy training program for both farmers and rural communities in Taiwan, explores factors that affect learners’ perception of learning information and communication technology (ICT). It further analyzes effects of individual characteristics and varied training designs on learners’ perception of learning ICT. Data used for analyses derive from the Farmers’ ICT Training Project of 2005, conducted by the Council of Agriculture in Taiwan (COAT), including evaluations of 4,405 trainees. Findings of hierarchical linear model (HLM) analysis supported both predictors of personal and organizational levels. Results of this study also revealed that learners’ characteristics and varied training designs do have effects on learner’s perception of training effectiveness. Specific impacts of learners’ personal characteristics on their perception of learning effectiveness in different types of ICT training are also analyzed and discussed. In conclusion, implications founded on learner’s perspective and suggestions for future research are illustrated in this paper.	information literacy;linear model;multilevel model	Hsiu-Ping Yueh;Tzy-Ling Chen;Li-An Chiu;Wei-Chien Lin	2013	Educational Technology & Society			HCI	-76.38199715573319	-40.38741091871454	55086

Among these popular systems are the online community building and information sharing sites that have become an intrinsic part of a new cyber-culture that continues to emerge. The involvement of students in collaborative technologies can be responsible in some cases for why certain students are inspired to pursue careers in computing disciplines. Yet very few CS 1 and CS 2 textbooks contain content related to collaborative software systems, presumably because of the extreme complexity involved in developing software that communicates with other software over a network. While social computing activities are very popular, the fact that it is not very prevalent in CS 1 and CS 2 course material can discourage students who have particular interest in that area of computing. In this paper, I present a system that I have developed that offers a simple way to incorporate class work and projects that involve collaborative networking and social computing paradigms at the level of introductory Computer Science courses.	client–server model;collaborative software;computer science;cyberculture;interaction;online community;pair programming;server (computing);social computing;software development process;software system;web content	Alan Shaw	2011	2011 Eighth International Conference on Information Technology: New Generations	10.1109/ITNG.2011.9	programming;human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;software engineering;multimedia;management;web 2.0;social computing;server;collaboration	HPC	-83.54803881248654	-34.623973102477464	55114

The CLDP takes a holistic viewpoint towards cyber education. Its methodology provides a model for all educators on how to integrate out-of-class enrichment opportunities with an in-class curriculum. CLDP is a voluntary program that has about 800 hours of required out-of-class activities. These required activities include being assigned a formal mentor, participation in a security or hacking club, attending a security conference, participating in security training, and participating in an internship. This program is in its inaugural year with ROTC and in its second year at the United States Military Academy.  The focus of this lightning talk will be to highlight the central aspects of the program and to describe how such programs would improve the holistic development of any students, security or otherwise. CLDP is not just a working military program -- it is an exportable concept that presents an applicable model for the development of cyber security students destined to support corporate America as well as government agencies at federal, state, and local levels.	academy;computer security;gene ontology term enrichment;holism	James C.

We examined how learners used an interactive 3D computer visualization to comprehend spatial relations in a virtual anatomy-like structure. Our goal was to examine the relationships between a number of variables, including individual differences among learners (such as spatial abilities), and features of the computer visualization (such as the nature of the interface). We present two experiments in which we investigated spatial comprehension and patterns of interactions among individuals.	experiment;interaction;interactivity;list comprehension	Madeleine Keehner;Peter Khooshabeh	2005			interactivity;visualization;computer science;natural language processing;comprehension;artificial intelligence;cognition;spatial relation	HCI	-71.41151625592555	-46.29170246671779	55177
60308b003893d07a9b3114bf21d3ffcc268aa718	effectiveness of a learner-directed model for e-learning		It is a hard task to strike a balance between extents of control a learner exercises and the amount of guidance, active or passive, afforded by the learning environment to guide, support, and motivate the learner. Adaptive systems strive to find the right balance in a spectrum that spans between self-control and system-guidance. They also concern a smoother shifting of the balance point during learning episodes in light of competing requirements from learning goals, learner capacity, instructional affordances, and educational theories, among others. This research investigates one of the extremes of this spectrum, where learners actively assume control and take responsibility for their own learning, while catering to individual preferences with little or no guidance from the e-learning environment. In this study, one unit material from an online Introduction to Java Programming course has been redesigned based on the proposed Learner-Directed Model for the experimental design study. The model is developed based on the exploration of two educational theories — ExperientialLearning Theory (ELT) and Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) Theory. The study involved a total of 35 participants (N = 35) divided randomly into one Experimental Group and one Control Group. They were assigned to either a Learner-Directed Model (Experimental Group) or a linear model (Control Group). Pre/post tests, survey, follow-up interview as well as log file analysis were instruments used for assessing students’ domain knowledge, meta-knowledge, and their attitudes for their overall learning experience. The results of the study have revealed that there is a statistically significant higher level of overall learning experience and better learning attitudes compared to Control Group students who studied with e-learning components that are linear in nature and are without explicit associations with educational theories.	adaptive system;computer programming;design of experiments;experiment;java;linear model;problem solving;randomness;requirement;social affordance;theory	Stella Lee;Trevor Barker;Vive Kumar	2016	Educational Technology & Society		active learning;educational technology;computer science;pedagogy;synchronous learning;adult education;multimedia;cooperative learning;open learning;experiential learning;learning sciences	HCI	-75.26407934269422	-41.90241429152936	55321

This is one of the reasons why usability of specialized software tools (GIS) belongs today to the top priorities of managers and users of information technologies. This requirement concerns geographic information systems in general but it principally concerns Web-based GIS sites because spatial data and tools for their utilization are nowadays in great demand by end-users too. Web-based GIS sites can provide an easy-to-use solution to the end users but they must be properly designed. Case study evaluating usability of three different Czech Web-based GIS applications by means of questionnaire-based usability user evaluation was done. Results are discussed and some recommendations how user interface of Web-based GIS should be designed, are concluded.

6247a1421b6608c25fc29bf935f0b66732deecca	students' engagement in technology rich classrooms and its relationship to professors' conceptions of effective teaching		The benefit of computer related tools in supporting student learning is influenced by the engaging nature of the learning environment and the design of the learning activities. Professors have considerable role in the design of learning environments and activities and the way they design the environment is found to depend on their conceptions of teaching. However, professors’ conceptions of (effective) teaching have not been studied in relation to technology use and student engagement. This dissertation study examined a) professors’ conceptions of effective teaching and their perceived technology use in technology rich classrooms, and b) the nature and extent of student engagement in these classrooms and its relationship to professors’ conceptions of effective teaching. Semi-structured interviews were used to obtain data from 13 professors who were teaching in active learning classrooms in a large research university in Eastern Canada in winter 2011. Interview questions focused on capturing professors’ conceptions of effective teaching in relation to the course they were teaching in the classroom, their expected learning outcomes for students, their instructional strategies, and the role they saw for computers and the type of software they used and/or expected their students to use in relation to the course. Following interviews with the professors, a survey was administered to their students in the end of the term. The instrument, Student Engagement in Technology Rich Classrooms (SETRC) was developed to determine aspects and extent of student engagement in the context. Two hundred thirty two students consented to participate in the research and completed the paper copy of the survey.	computer;design rationale;natural deduction;non-convexity (economics);principal component analysis;varimax rotation	Engida Gebre;Alenoush Saroyan;Robert Bracewell	2014	BJET	10.1111/bjet.12001	psychology;mathematics education;student engagement;social psychology;pedagogy	HCI	-75.63037884387064	-33.68783885188067	55420

We claim that the core of the problem is how technology is being used. Technologies such as simulations are currently not used to their full potential. For instance, physiology simulations often follow textbooks by sequentially exposing individual systems such as the circulatory and respiratory systems one at a time, leaving out essential comprehension of system interactions. Moreover, the standard computer lab hides students behind large monitors and ignores the social aspect of learning. We have created a new kind of infrastructure, called Collective Simulations to provide engaging inquiry-based science learning modules that uniquely combine social learning pedagogies with distributed simulation technology. This infrastructure creates immersive learning experiences based on wirelessly connected computers and enables radically different classroom learning experiences that engage students and teachers simultaneously. Collective Simulations allow students to learn about the intricacies of interdependent complex systems by engaging in discourse with other students and teachers. As part of our Mr. Vetro Collective Simulation, students learn about physiology through technology-enhanced role-play. Each group controls physiological variables of a single organ on their computer. A central simulation gathers all the data and projects the composite view of a human. In an example activity, the heart and lung teams collaborate to adjust parameters and reach homeostasis. Results from formal evaluation studies demonstrate a positive impact on scientific inquiry, student learning, and students’ interest in personal health issues. This article describes Mr. Vetro and its underlying architecture and presents the evaluation results.	simulation	Andri Ioannidou;Alexander Repenning;David C.

The project was begun with the assumption that an attempt to design such a system would probably fail, and that a more promising approach would be to attempt to evolve one through use. Accordingly, a system incorporating some of the capabilities that it was thought would be useful for speech training was developed, and installed at the Clarke School for the Deaf where it is now being used on an experimental basis in a remedial speech-training program. The expectation was that the capabilities of the system would be modified and extended as attempts to use it provided insights concerning what features it should have. To ensure that such insights do in fact guide the system's evolution, developers and users are engaged in a continuing dialogue concerning the desirability and feasibility of specific modifications and extensions, both in the training procedures that are used in conjunction with the system and in the characteristics of the system itself.	edmund m. clarke	R.

One instant interaction mode provided the students (N = 36) with anonymous feedback in chronological time sequence, while the other showed their feedback by “like” ranking (N = 26). The behavioural patterns of undergraduates using these two different modes were compared. The results showed that the like-ranked feedback deepened the interaction between asking and answering questions, reduced the number of irrelevant messages, and increased attention to questionable messages. The students using the like-ranking mode also received more encouragement during the flipped classroom discussion activities.	interaction	Ting-Chia Hsu	2018	Interactive Learning Environments	10.1080/10494820.2017.1283332	blended learning;multimedia;educational technology;computer science;flipped classroom;mobile device;instant;communication channel	HCI	-72.68554842454894	-44.045302681505284	55608

Our method takes borrowed techniques from Software Engineering such as the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and Model-driven Architecture (MDA). The main goal of this approach is the creation of generic courses that may be refined later depending on different educational contexts. Therefore, teachers will have automatic support from tools in order to schedule lectures, activities or resources. This experience is being carried out in the context of a Communications Software course for different undergraduate degree programs at the University of Málaga.	model-driven architecture;model-driven integration;software engineering;unified modeling language	Jesús Martínez	2010			computer science;software engineering	SE	-81.4617970515682	-31.64560671728333	55655

This idea has been further cemented by the standardized admissions process used by Chilean universities, where female mathematics scores have historically been lower than that of their male peers. In order to break these stereotypes and attract more women into STEM careers, the Faculty of Mathematical and Physical Sciences at the University of Chile has created the Gender Equality Admissions Program (PEG, for its name in Spanish, Programa de Ingreso Prioritario de Equidad de Génera) in 2013. Under this program, 40 extra women are selected into the most competitive engineering and science program in the country. In the five years that the PEG has been in place, the number of women accepted into the engineering and science program has grown from 19% to more than 32%.

ef83ef99ec8a34f990577db0b52a8c8e4cc6d1ab	cheating prevention in virtual worlds: software, economic, and law aspects	virtual worlds	This paper deals with networked applications in the emerging field of online virtual worlds. Example applications include, e.g., Massively Multiplayer Online Computer Games (MMOG), networked e-learning, training and simulations, etc. Highly interactive virtual worlds bring a new security challenge: the multiple participants of such applications do not always show cooperative and intended behavior, but rather may act in an illegal way (cheating) which is harmful for other participants, thus intentionally or accidentally procuring illicit advantages for themselves. The paper studies the new challenge of cheating in virtual-world applications in three areas: a) system and application programming, b) economics, and c) law. The main contributions of our work are as follows: 1) We present a systematic classification of cheating threats in virtual worlds, and describe software solutions that help prevent them in future Internet-based applications; 2) We enhance the classical economic analysis of crime and punishment for applying it to virtual worlds; 3) We describe our development approach for networked virtual worlds and its implementation as the Real-Time Framework (RTF) which has been designed at the University of Muenster; 4) Finally, we explore the law aspects of cheating in virtual applications in the context of the legal system in Germany. The consideration of informatics aspects together with the corresponding problems of economics and law allows us to tackle virtual-world security in a holistic, systematic manner.

Fifty 13-year-old students completed two randomly selected assessment tasks, receiving automated regulation feedback between them. Student performance was (self-)graded by students and by experts. Expert, as well as student (self)grades showed a significant increase between Task 1 and Task 2. However, further analysis of the expert grades showed significant improvement in performance for girls only. Furthermore, the formative assessment system traced the number of searches and the number of websites consulted per student to complete the two assignments. On average, the results showed that students consulted significantly more websites for Task 2, compared to Task 1. The average number of searches did not differ significantly between Tasks 1 and 2. On the other hand, significant differences were found for those students who, during the evaluation of their performance on Task 1, explicitly stated that they would increase their searches.

By situating technologies of literacy as sociomaterial the purpose of this paper is to analyse and discuss these experiences and understandings in order to challenge dominant views of search in information literacy research. Design/methodology/approach – Six focus group interviews with in total 39 teachers working at four different elementary and secondary schools were conducted in the autumn of 2014. Analysis was done using a sociomaterial perspective, which provides tools for understanding how pupils and teachers interact with and are demanded to translate their interest to technologies of literacy, in this case search engines, such as Google. Findings – The teachers expressed difficulties of conceptualizing search as something they could teach. When they did, search was most often identified as a practical skill. A critical perspective on search, recognizing the role of Google as a dominant part of the information infrastructure and a coconstructor of what there is to know was largely lacking. As a consequence of this neglected responsibility of teaching search, critical assessment of online information was conflated with Google’s relevance ranking. Originality/value – The study develops a critical understanding of the role of searching and search engines as technologies of literacy in relation to critical assessment in schools. This is of value for information literacy training.	experience;focus group;information literacy;outsourcing;relevance;web search engine	Olof Sundin;Hanna Carlsson	2016	Journal of Documentation	10.1108/JD-12-2015-0148	library science;information infrastructure;social science;computer science;knowledge management;information literacy;multimedia;trustworthy computing;world wide web	HCI	-74.41855304675933	-27.72437759644282	55955

Thus, virtual learning environments should pay attention to these parameters. In this paper, a new e-learning model is designed and implemented according to these parameters. The Virtual learning environment that is presented here uses two agents: Virtual Tutor Agent (VTA), and Virtual Classmate Agent (VCA). During the learning process and depending on events happening in the environment, learner’s emotions are changed. In this situation, learning style should be revised according to the personality traits as well as the learner’s current emotions. VTA selects suitable learning style for the learners based on their personality traits. To improve the learning process, the system uses VCA in some of the learning steps. VCA is an intelligent agent and has its own personality. It is designed so that it can present an attractive and real learning environment in interaction with the learner. To recognize the learner’s personality, this system uses MBTI test and to obtain emotion values uses OCC model. Finally, the results of system tested in real environments show that considering the human features in interaction with the learner increases learning quality and satisfies the learner.

d0d8a0c7608823c65bcb9c2f06a94905a567ab62	six tips for students interested in big data analytics	big data analytics	F orrester, a global research and advisory firm, estimates firms effectively utilize less than five percent of available data, mainly due to the lack of training and skills necessary for the type of information gathering and analysis needed to transform big data. If you are considering a career in information technology, business analytics, and/or computer science, you may want to consider the data scientist role. As I’m often asked where students can begin, I’ve pulled together six tips for those interested in a career in the growing and exciting field of big data. 1. look for programs offering hands-on training. Large organizations like IBM are working with academic organizations around the world specifically in the area of expanding and strengthening data and analytics curricula to meet the growing demand of highly skilled business professionals of the future. As an example, Yale’s School of Management partnered with IBM to examine existing case studies and apply big data analytics software to solve problems. 2. Gain domain expertise, or industry knowledge, across several fields before applying data analysis to gain the best insights. As Manish Parashar, director of Rutgers Discovery Informatics Institute says, “Students not only need to learn tools to handle big data—they must learn how to integrate big data into their reasoning.” Domain expertise will be important across multiple industries as the applications of big data analytics expand. 3. develop an understanding of business practices. In a recent conversation on big data skills, educator and author Terri Griffith believes you can’t manage people, technology, or organizational processes in silos. Instead, an effective data professional in the business world knows how to use all of their resources as well as mix and match solutions of people, technology, and other assets across the organization. 4. Gain background in computer science and software development, but do not ignore basic analytical skills such as statistics. During an online panel discussion, Anders Rhod Gregersen of Vestas Wind Systems stated the “power-users” of analytics are statisticians. By combining math with computer science, data professionals can develop unique algorithms that analyze data in organization-specific ways. This unique overlap is known as “machine learning” and is one of the most in-demand skills. 5. learn to think like a scientist. Scientists see the world very differently. They do research, ask questions, and set up experiments to get answers. They question everything and don’t just look at data, they dissect it. 6. never stop learning. Ask people to explain what they do to expand your skills and explore supplemental learning opportunities.	algorithm;big data;business analytics;computer science;data science;experiment;hands-on computing;informatics;machine learning;software development	Anjul Bhambhri	2012	ACM Crossroads	10.1145/2331042.2331047	data science;data mining;world wide web	ML	-78.40125738911377	-27.753617211887313	56134

4f83aa86bd97ef91cc24ff47c07d7b0fea9453b9	tracked speech-to-text display: enhancing accessibility and readability of real-time speech-to-text	deaf and hard of hearing users;accessible technology	Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) students are under-served and under-represented in education in part because they miss spoken classroom information, even with aural-to-visual accommodations, such as a real-time speech to text Display (SD). Most SD systems utilize a trained typist to transcribe the speech into text (speech-to-text) onto a display. Still, these students encounter significant but subtle barriers in following speech-to-text displays, especially when detailed visuals are used or when the speaker is fast or uses uncommon words. Hearing students can simultaneously watch the visuals and listen to the spoken explanation, while DHH students constantly look away from the SD to search and observe details in the classroom visuals. As a result, they spend less time watching the visuals and gain less information than their hearing peers. They can also fall behind in reading the speech-text.  We discuss the implementation and evaluation of a real-time Tracked Speech-To-Text Display (TSD), that addresses these subtle barriers presented by SD systems. The TSD system minimizes the student's viewing distance between the Speech-to-Text Display and the speaker. This is done through tracking the presenter and displaying the speech-text at a fixed distance above the presenter. Our evaluation showed that students significantly preferred TSD over SD and reported that it was easier to follow the lecture. They liked being able to see both the teacher and speech-to-text, and being able to set the number of displayed lines.	accessibility;real-time clock;real-time transcription;speech recognition;tsd;text display	Raja S.

Thus, search engines/tools for the Holy Quran are very essential for researchers in order to locate particular verses of the Quran and their related concepts, meaning, location etc. This study intends to gather information on available Quran search engines/tools in order to setup guidelines for the minimum requirements needed in designing Quran search engines. To achieve the goal of this study, the pros and cons of available engines are discussed. Owing to the difficulties encountered in collecting information on these Quran search tools and the unavailability of technical background for Quran-related search engines, in some cases the results may not be comparable. Finally, from the surveyed Quran search engines the challenges are identified in order to aid in the design of efficient Quran related search tools.	requirement;web search engine	Yasser M.

The purpose of this paper is to inform educators and instructional designers on factors affecting teachers’ adoption of modern educational computer games. A case study was conducted to identify the factors affecting the adoption of Dimenxian, which was a new educational computer game designed to teach Algebra to middle school students. The diffusion of innovations theory was used as the conceptual framework of this study. The results indicated that compatibility, relative advantage, complexity and trialability played important roles in the game adoption. These findings were compared with the existing literature on (1) the adoption of educational software, and (2) the barriers in the use of educational computer games in K-12 settings to help guide future research and practice. The comparison showed that (1) adoption attributes for the games and other educational software had a similar pattern from high to low significance: relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability and observability; and (2) the game adoption factors were more inclusive than the barriers of using the computer games. Introduction New educational products, even with obvious advantages, are being adopted very slowly by educational institutions (Rogers, 1962, 2003). Educational computer (video) games are considered effective teaching tools because they (1) use action instead of explanation, (2) create personal motivation and satisfaction, (3) accommodate multiple learning styles and skills, (4) reinforce mastery skills and (5) provide interactive and decision-making contexts (Kebritchi & Hirumi, 2008). Educational computer games are considered powerful tools that have the potential for improving the quality of the American educational system, yet the games are not being readily adopted by schools British Journal of Educational Technology Vol 41 No 2 2010 256–270 doi:10.1111/j.1467-8535.2008.00921.x © 2009 The Author.

This problem necessitates investigation of the factors that influence the adoption of games. A review of literature indicated that there is a dearth of empirical study in identifying adoption factors of educational computer games in K-12 settings. The literature review found a number of studies that have identified challenges in the use of educational computer games in school settings (eg, Egenfeldt-Nielsen, 2005; Gros, 2003; Klawe & Phillips, 1995; Lopez-Moreto & Lopez, 2007; Shaffer, 2006; Squire, Giovanetto, Devane & Durga, 2005). However, no study was found with particular focus on game adoption in school settings. In addition, the relationship between game adoption and game use factors has not been investigated. Therefore, this study was conducted to (1) identify factors affecting teachers’ adoption of educational computer games, (2) determine whether the factors affecting the adoption of modern educational computer games differ from those identified in the existing literature on the adoption of educational software in K-12 settings and (3) identify whether the adoption factors are related to the barriers of using the games in K-12 settings. In short, the following questions guided this study: • What are the factors affecting teachers’ adoption of educational computer games? • Is there any relationship between the adoption factors of the educational computer games and other educational software? • Is there any relationship between the game adoption factors and the challenges of using the games in school settings? To answer these questions, this paper is divided into four main sections. Section I provides the answer to the first research question by explaining the method and results of a qualitative case study conducted to identify game adoption factors from teachers’ perspectives. In this study, Rogers’ (1962, 2003) theory of diffusion of innovation was used to examine the adoption of Dimenxian (Tabula Digita Inc., Long Island City, NY), a modern mathematics computer game. Sections II and III provide answers to the second and third research questions by providing the results of two literature reviews conducted based on Cooper’s (1988) framework. Finally, Section IV presents the conclusion of the study by integrating the results of the previous three sections. The results of this study help Dimenxian and possibly similar game designers modify their games based on teachers’ needs and preferences. In addition, the results characterise the pattern of the practice of adopting Dimenxian and similar games by K-12 teachers. A comprehensive description of the game, situation and research participants is provided to make it possible to use the results of this study in other similar situations. Section I: Identifying Dimenxian adoption factors A case study with qualitative method was conducted to facilitate dialogue between mathematics teachers, who were looking for engaging interactive tools to enhance the teaching of complicated subjects, and Dimenxian designers, who need to understand The factors affecting adoption of educational games: a Case Study 257 © 2009 The Author. Journal compilation © 2009 Becta. teachers’ needs and perspectives. The goal of the case study was to understand a larger phenomenon of the factors affecting the adoption of modern educational computer games by examination of the adoption factors of Dimenxian. Conceptual framework Rogers’ (1962, 2003) theory of diffusion of innovation was used as the conceptual framework of this study to examine the game adoption factors. Instructional technologists have begun to use Rogers’ (1962, 2003) theory on the Diffusion of Innovations to better understand and facilitate the adoption of new educational products (Surry, 1997). Rogers’ theory has been widely used in a variety of settings, ranging from diffusion of rural technology among farmers to the adoption of innovations in educational settings (Berger, 2005; Martins, Steil & Todesco, 2004). This theory is useful for instructional technologists to explain, predict and account for the factors that impede or facilitate the diffusion of their products (Surry, 1997). An innovation refers to ‘an idea, practice, or object that is perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption’ (Rogers, 2003, p. 12). An innovation is not necessarily new in its design, but it is new to its users (Berger, 2005). Dimenxian had not been previously used by the research participants in this study and therefore it was considered an innovation. Rogers (2003) considered the following five key attributes of innovations that affect adoption of an innovation: 1. Relative advantage refers to the perceptions of adopters on the advantages or disadvantages of an innovation. 2. Compatibility refers to the degree to which an innovation is perceived as compatible with the adopters’ work and values. 3. Complexity refers to the degree to which an innovation is perceived as difficult to understand and use. 4. Trialability refers to the degree to which an innovation may be experimented by adopters on a limited basis before full actual use. 5. Observability refers to the degree to which the results of an innovation are visible to potential adopters. The diffusion of Dimenxian was investigated from teachers’ perspectives along these five attributes.	blackwell (series);compiler;complexity;geforce 9 series;pc game;rūsiņš mārtiņš freivalds	Mansureh Kebritchi	2010	BJET	10.1111/j.1467-8535.2008.00921.x	psychology;educational technology;simulation;computer science;instructional design;multimedia;resistance;pedagogy	HCI	-75.27845192733501	-35.738180103257186	56309

This computer-assisted board game, Last Island, which incorporates a system dynamics model into a board game's core mechanics, attempts to impart knowledge and understanding on sustainability and how an isolated society may transition to various futures to a non-expert community of players. To this end, this collaborative-competitive game utilizes the Miniworld model which simulates three variables important for the sustainability of a society: human population, economic production and the state of the environment.

After finding that many problems are deeply rooted in transportation infrastructure, we discovered several that could be addressed through design of an interface to carpooling. We found that people are often hesitant to carpool with unknown drivers. Our system offers numerous features to create and nurture sustainable carpools, bringing together design principles with organizational principles and workplace knowledge. Preliminary testing of our system encourages us that its combination of features could increase the success rate of workplace carpools.	network congestion;workplace os	Joshua Morse;Joshua Palay;Yarun Luon;Satyendra Nainwal	2007		10.1145/1240866.1240952	community;simulation;human–computer interaction;management;world wide web;social consciousness	HCI	-66.79917079673488	-30.70632838915569	56403

However, the general quality and utility of MOOCs has been criticized. Most MOOCs have been structured with minimal consideration of relevant aspects of human cognitive architecture and instructional design principles. This paper suggests cognitive load theory, with its roots embedded in our knowledge of human cognitive architecture and evolutionary educational psychology, is ideally placed to provide instructional design principles for all forms of computer-based learning, including MOOCs. The paper outlines the theory and indicates instructional design principles that could be used to structure online learning and to provide an appropriate base for instructional design when using computer-based learning.	cognitive architecture;embedded system;experiment;internet;john d. wiley;massive open online course;randomized algorithm	O.

Research in human computer interaction (HCI) has demonstrated that primary cognitive abilities represent a powerful predictor of information-seeking success in electronic information systems. Specifically, spatial visualization ability (SVA) seems to be particularly related to hierarchical menus systems navigation within databases, online learning environments, information archival systems, and virtually all internet web sites. Research indicates that individuals with low SVA take longer to complete tasks and experience more errors on first attempts to find information in hierarchical databases compared to those with high SVA. Understanding the influences of SVA as well as its interaction with other aspects of individual differences, such as domain expertise, is critical to the design of systems intended to accommodate individual differences in users. Thirty-five college students (23 males and 12 females) were selected from the general student body of two universities and assigned to groups based upon their self-reported membership in one of two specific disciplines: business ðn 1⁄4 26Þ or biology ðn 1⁄4 9Þ. Participants were then assigned to groups based upon scores on tests of SVA using a median-split. Each participant conducted five searches: one neutral search, two searches for business related information, and two searches for biology related information using the FirstSearch archival search tool. A 2 2 factorial Analysis of Variance with one between-groups variable (high vs. low SVA) and one within-group variable (high vs. low domain expertise) indicated a significant main effect of SVA as well as a significant main effect of Domain Expertise on the time required to Corresponding author.

There was no interaction between SVA and Domain Expertise on either time to first article or total number of articles found. Results of the study extend existing knowledge regarding the effects of SVA and domain expertise on information seeking by demonstrating a strong effect of SVA and domain expertise on information seeking skills. The results of this study also provide evidence in support of interface designs that are friendlier to information seekers who have low SVA. Related findings and suggestions for further research are discussed. 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

An exploratory study of interaction experience with a news Web site was conducted. An online questionnaire was used to collect information on demographics, Internet-use and news-site use behaviour of users of a particular news site, and to recruit participants for a think-aloud study. The protocol analysis of screen-capture and audio recordings of participants, who used a news site while thinking aloud, yielded five categories of experience: impression, content, layout, information architecture and diversion. These categories are regarded as spontaneous, self-reported aspects of users’ experience with a news site. A set of interaction-experience questionnaires revealed significant differences between regular users and non-users of a news site. Correlation and regression analyses demonstrated support for Hassenzahl’s model of interaction experience. The study presents a first attempt to empirically investigate the aspects of interaction experience in relation to online news sites. 2012 British Informatics Society Limited Published by Elsevier B.V.

The system utilizes data mining, clustering analysis, and statistical tools for clustering students according to their online learning behaviors, learning achievements, and thinking styles. It also provides graphical time stamps for teachers to observe the online activities of students at each learning phase. By using this system, teachers can apply different remedial strategies according to the different online learning behaviors of students. The students in this study received adaptive warning messages and remedial treatments according to their individual learning situations. The results revealed that the proposed strategy can encourage students whose online learning performances are initially evaluated as good or medium and improve their online learning performances. In the case of students with poor online learning performances, this system improves not only their performances but also their learning achievements. This is achieved by continuously dispatching adaptive warning messages to the students in question. The relationship between thinking styles and online learning achievements is also considered in this study. It is indicated that a strategy of sending adaptive warning messages also works well on students with different thinking styles. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

7d7fc324369336f28cf88c6814f0e50123ba51e9	game technology for training and education	training and education	Serious games are being more and more deployed in such diverse areas as public awareness, military training, and higher education. One of the driving forces behind this stems from the rapidly growing availability of game technologies, providing not only better, faster, and more realistic graphics, physics, and animations, but above all making “the language” of game development accessible to increasingly more people. The articles in this special issue are a rich sampling of how game technology can be creatively put to service within games for training and education purposes. The first two articles are focused on simulation applications. In “SIDH—a game-based architecture for a training simulator,” Backlund et al. extend the notion of gamebased simulation proposing an architecture for a professional firefighter training simulator that incorporates novel visualization and interaction modes. The serious game, developed in cooperation with the government agency responsible for the training of fire and rescue personnel, is a good example of how game technology helps making the delicate combination of engaging level design and carefully tuned learning objectives. In “Experiential learning in vehicle dynamics education via motion simulation and interactive gaming,” Hulme et al. present an original methodology developed within their vehicle dynamics curriculum, incorporating a combination of driving simulation, motion simulation, and educational practices into a game-based simulation framework. The paper also includes a comprehensive evaluation of their approach in two practical, educational scenarios. The next two articles describe specific applications of game technology to serious games aimed at computer science education. In “An application of game development framework in higher education,” Wang et al. present their experiences with an XNA-based game project for teaching software architecture. The paper also includes a brief survey and evaluation of game frameworks currently available for these purposes. On the other hand, in “Towards a serious game to help students learn computer programming,” Muratet et al. describe the design and development of a strategy game aimed at strengthening novice programming skills, including an interesting discussion on the mapping of learning objectives into the game play. Finally, in “Venation skeleton-based modeling plant leaf wilting,” Lu et al. present an original method for simulating and visualizing leaf wilting, useful in the domain of biology. Interestingly, their technique can be applied both in a didactic setting and within any graphics framework requiring realistic visualization of natural phenomena. We believe that serious games will continue to foster the development of new game technologies, and, conversely, combining and deploying existing game technology in novel ways will likely extend and amplify the impact and innovation achieved by these games in our society.

In order to discover if the accessibility of the job search and interview process plays a role in the unemployment of this population, we interviewed people who are blind and visually impaired about their recent experiences regarding the job search and interview process. We discovered that there are many accessibility issues that can impact success in obtaining a job, including the inaccessibility of job applications, pre- and post-interview tests, and accommodations during the interview. We also found that often the employee onboarding, the process which helps new hires acclimate to a new environment, can be inaccessible to people with visual impairments. Based on these interviews, we developed new guidelines for employers.	accessibility;experience;gene regulatory network;nonlinear gameplay	William Grussenmeyer;Jesel Garcia;Eelke Folmer;Fang Jiang	2017		10.1145/3058555.3058570	unemployment;job applications;applied psychology;onboarding;population;social psychology;psychology	HCI	-84.43973651627029	-24.750483974524645	56646

4747f4e167fd7b30090fffa650be3a49b564364c	t-educo: a t-learning tutoring tool that cares	interactive digital television;intelligent tutoring systems;affective computing	639 Interactive Digital Television is emerging as a potential medium to create opportunities for learning at home. In most existing t-learning (TV-based interactive learning) applications, the interaction with the user is limited to a simple sequential navigation within the application. And, since the educational contents are broadcast, there is no feedback from the student’s progress. More engaged and intelligent t-learning interactive applications are needed to achieve more efficient forms of learning. This paper presents T-EDUCO, the first t-learning affective aware tutoring tool. T-EDUCO goes further than simply broadcasting an interactive educational application by allowing the figure of a tutor to be present and to govern the students’ learning process. The tutor can access academic and emotional information about the students through a continuous “emotional path” that includes timestamps and information about the progress made in each exercise. In this way, personal messages or extra educational contents for improving learning can be sent to the students. The emotional information is extracted by a novel Artificial Intelligence method that evaluates with a 2dimensional affective approach the students’ facial expressions captured through a camera while performing the t-learning application tests. All this is made possible by a combination of broadcast and broadband technologies.	algorithm;artificial intelligence;facial recognition system;feedback;human factors and ergonomics;ip camera;interaction;kalman filter;management system;nl (complexity);norm (social);numerical aperture;pedagogical agent;personalization;server (computing);set-top box;telecommuting;trusted timestamping;video server	Isabelle Hupont;David Abadía-Gallego;Sandra Baldassarri;Eva Cerezo;Rafael Del Hoyo	2011	International Journal on Artificial Intelligence Tools	10.1142/S0218213011000383	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;affective computing;multimedia	HCI	-67.81408794733035	-40.09746420205076	56902

Recently, the discipline of IT Service Management (ITSM) has become globally recognized as critical to organizations. Academia appears to be lagging industry in providing education in this field. This paper describes the motivation, implementation, outcomes and challenges experienced by two universities, one in Australia and the other in Germany, in designing and offering an ITSM course. Both universities included the curriculum for industry certification for Foundation level examinations and facilitated student access to these examinations. Using a narrative inquiry method, the authors share their experiences and compare these two courses. The feedback from students clearly indicates that the students value the opportunity to achieve industry certification in ITSM. A list of lessons learnt is formulated to assist other universities undertaking similar endeavours. The outcomes of the analysis highlight the need for professional development and industry certification of Lecturers, the importance of networking with local industry practitioners, and the importance of maintaining course materials to keep current with frameworks used in the ICT industry.	experience	Aileen Cater-Steel;Rüdiger Zarnekow;Jochen Wulf	2011			narrative inquiry;information technology infrastructure library;computer science;knowledge management;marketing;information management;management	HCI	-76.87260350243145	-31.938756369827026	56905

In most applications the results tend to be qualitative, describing such aspects that require some improvement for the benefit of usability. However, these qualitative results do not allow us to determine how usable it is or how it becomes an interactive system. Hence the need for quantitative results may also be very necessary in order to determine the effort that would be needed to get a sufficiently usable system. This article describes, following the idea of the UsabAIPO Project, a new experiment to obtain quantitative results after a heuristic evaluation. This new experimentation has required some variation on the original idea, working with a set of different heuristic categories, while considering the use of the score depending on severity and frequency parameters.	heuristic evaluation	Marta González;Llúcia Masip;Toni Granollers;Marta Oliva	2009	Advances in Engineering Software	10.1016/j.advengsoft.2009.01.027	usability goals;reliability engineering;cognitive walkthrough;simulation;usability;computer science;systems engineering;effort heuristic;heuristic evaluation;software metric	SE	-64.39082973290483	-47.89508469268971	56935

Consequently, there is now a wide gulf between the unlimited use of technology and higher education, particularly with respect to digital communications and the rapid increase in the use of social media in instructional applications. Technology offers college students an array of options to socialize, network, stay informed and connected, but technology proficiency may not be the same for instructors. As social media use by students becomes more established, educators in higher education are pursuing methods to parlay expertise in instruction to advertise and market higher education institutions.

8bbb256fafaeb4d8f258e686980606a72b660dbb	a pedagogical framework for enhancing skills of references and citations	qa76 electronic computers computer science computer software	References and citations form a basis for scientific research and creation/discovery of knowledge. However literature reviews had indicated that many errors are present in scholarly papers published in journals and conferences as well as in books and articles. Furthermore, course works of students studying in higher education institutions contain mistakes in references lists and in-text citations. Problems that stem from these inaccuracies are multifarious and range from the act of plagiarism, not acknowledging the source, problems in information access and retrieval as well as causing inaccuracies in ranking articles and journals, thus hindering the growth of knowledge. Based on the importance of this global issue this research was initiated. The first objective of our research was to determine root causes for the presence of mistakes and inadequacies in references and citations within the academic arena. We chose the academic arena because they are the training grounds for education and scientific research. Furthermore, through this research we sought a unique practical solution for this issue.#R##N##R##N#In order to conduct a thorough and comprehensive investigation into the above mentioned problems, and to achieve the aim of proposing a suitable solution, we divided our research work into three main phases. First phase was the investigative phase. During this phase a thorough literature review was conducted. As a result of this review, research questions were formed. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were adopted to investigate the causes of erroneous references and citations. Triangulation research methodology was used to get reliable and comprehensive information. Data received through these methods were analyzed and core issues such as inadequate feedback and training in referencing task were highlighted.#R##N##R##N#In the second phase, termed as solution phase, a pedagogical framework was proposed to resolve issues that were reported during the investigative phase. A conceptual framework was built on the principles of Learning theories and spaced repetition theory. To evaluate this framework experiments were conducted. This was done in the third and final phase of the research which was termed as evaluation phase. Two types of experiments were conducted, first type was in a traditional classroom environment and the second type of experiment was with students who chose to work independently (without tutors). Data were collected and analyzed from these experiments using both quantitative methods and qualitative methods and were analyzed.#R##N##R##N#This research provides insight into causes of errors within referencing tasks of students in higher education. It Indicates that reform in the pedagogy for teaching this skill is needed. Furthermore a unique pedagogy is presented. Results from experiments have indicated that through the proposed operational model improvements of referencing skills have been seen.		Saba K.

0170b2fca7e20e726c47062f29df36f111cd9f3a	computational vision applied to the monitoring of mobile robots in educational robotic scenarios		A frequent concern among students and teachers working with educational robotics is about the results gathered through practical activities. Currently, educational institutions and robotics competitions lack of mechanisms that can evaluate the robot's behavior during the accomplishment of the proposed challenges. In this work, we propose the development of a technological solution using Computational Vision, whose purpose is to monitor and evaluate the performance of mobile robots during the execution of Robotics Pedagogic tasks. The developed system, named MonitoRE — Monitoring System for Educational Robotics, was tested on three categories of pedagogic robotics environments, obtaining promising results. Our tool uses an Absolute Location Method with descriptors based on color and shape to analyze the task environments, mapping the path taken by the robot, evaluating the achievements in the proposed tasks. The experiments carried out indicate that the adopted method is effective, performing satisfactory results in robotic monitoring. In addition, it was found that teachers and students felt more motivated, demonstrating interest in using monitored task environments, because it ease the understanding of the difficulties faced by the moving robot in completing the activities, assisting students in the teaching-learning process.	color;computer user satisfaction;computer vision;digital camera;educational robotics;experiment;image processing;location (geography);mobile robot;real-time computing;system of measurement	Marcel Leite Rios;José Francisco de Magalhães Netto;Thais Oliveira Almeida	2017	2017 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)	10.1109/FIE.2017.8190722	simulation;educational robotics;knowledge management;sociology;mobile robot;robot;mobile telephony;artificial intelligence;robotics	Robotics	-66.39205426510742	-46.59878899772405	57329

Preschooland kindergarten-aged children (n = 183) were randomly assigned to one of the three CAI groups and spent 40 min a week, for 13 weeks, using the software program in a computer lab. An additional control group of students attending typical preschool or kindergarten received no CAI. ANCOVA results examining post-test reading ability sum score, covarying pre-test score, indicated that the mastery-based sequencer group significantly outperformed the learner-control and control groups, but was not statistically different from the linear sequence group. Analysis by task, rather than overall reading score, revealed significantly better performance for the linear sequence group over controls and picture menu group on the Initial Sound Fluency task, while the mastery-based sequencer group outperformed all three other groups on Non Word Fluency. In sum, these results suggest that the use of a sequencer is a very important element in presenting computerized reading content for young children. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

71c18124bae5a8d7239d7a64c99d9ef110fa01cd	availability and use of educational media in secondary schools in ondo state	equipment;1985;multi media instruction;secondary school;enseignement multi media;technologie de l education;media;television d enseignement;equipement;teaching aid;ecole secondaire;educational technology;nigeria;moyen d enseignement;educational television;educational broadcasting;radiodiffusion scolaire	The author reports on a pilot study aimed at identifying what items of educational media were available in selected schools in Ondo State, Nigeria, and the extent of their use. A twenty-eight item questionnaire was used to assess availability. use, attitude of principals and support for instructional media. Seventy-seven schools from different parts of Ondo State participated in the study. The results showed that these secondary schools were generally very poorly equipped with educational media and that the level of use was very low. The reasons for this are fourfold: economic, political, the lack of training and the lack of co-ordination among the agencies responsible. Recommendations include the rationalisation of small schools, a programme of workshops and seminars and the involvement of classroom teachers in the planning and production of educational broadcasts. ‘Educational technology can significantly affect [American] education in several ways, such as broadening the potential for delivery of educational programmes to learners at all ages and grade levels and compensating for the sometimes adverse effects of geography and economic status on the quality ofeducation available to the student. Yet even today, little is known or agreed upon concerning the role and impact of various instructional technologies in our nation’s schools.’ (Riccobono 198 5). Riccobono’s introductory paragraph to the Final Report on availability, use and support on instructional media was written about the American school system in 1982-3. However, his observation is valid in the Nigerian context, and perhaps for any country in the world today. That the media can make. and have indeed made, significant positive contributions to improvement both in the quantity and quality of learning is no longer a subject for debate. As Schramm (1 9 77) has noted: ‘Motivated students learn from any medium if it is competently used and adapted to their needs. Within its physical limits, any medium can perform any educational task. Whether a student learns more from one medium Educational media in secondary schools in Ondo State 33 than another is at least as likely to depend on how the medium is used as on what medium is used.’ In more recent times, scholars have continued to insist not only on the role of the media in the teaching/learning process, but also on a redefinition of the relationship between media and instruction. It has been argued that since media to be used in instruction are determined by the requirements of the instructional objectives the content to be delivered, and the method to be used, such media cannot be regarded as supplementary to, or as being used in support of. instruction, but as the instructional input itself (Kemp 1980). This notion has rendered obsolete the concept of ‘audiovisual aids’, an expression which suggests that media are only aids ie things after the real instruction has been planned. On the contrary, media are an integral part of the instructional design process. 34 British Journal oj Educational Technology Vol24 No 1 1993 The role of the media in education acquires ever-increasing significance not only because of the ever-changing social, economic and cultural conditions in modern societies, but also because of rapid developments in science and technology. Not only have new technologies with great potential uses been developed, but also new uses are daily being found for old ones. In the 1960s and 19 70s, the excitement was all about radio and television and their potential for improving the quality and extending the reach of education. Now, in addition to these and other time-honoured technologies such as the overhead projector, slide projector, 16 mm film projector and filmstrip projector, there are newer and potentially more promising technologies. These include videotapes, compact discs, videodiscs, computers, teletext, viewdata, satellite communication and suchlike. The application of these technologies to the educational enterprise has become a major priority for people all over the world who are concerned about raising the quality of learning and making education available to all who desire it. Meanwhile, as the demand for education is rising phenomenally at all levels, the resources needed to provide it are growing correspondingly scarcer. According to the Federal Ministry of Education (1 986). Nigeria has witnessed a phenomenal growth at all levels and forms of education both in terms of enrolment and physical facilities. Ondo State is in the south west of Nigeria (Figure 1). During 1975/6 to 1983. its enrolment at the primary level rose from 3 7.833 to 84.290 (Ibid. 62). At the post-primary level there was a rise in enrolment from 17,028 in 1976/77 to 84,285 in 1983. In most of the State the number ofsecondary schools doubled and in some cases tripled. Table 1 shows the trend in the growth of the number of secondary schools in seven Local Government Areas between 1978179 and 1982183. The picture was generally similar elsewhere in the State. Unfortunately, the growth in the number of secondary schools and the consequent increase in enrolment were not matched by a corresponding growth in the number of qualified teachers or in the provision of necessary facilities. The result has been a shortage of teachers and Table I : Trend in growth of the number of secondary schools in seven Local Government Areas between 1978179 and 1982183		Chris Okwudishu	1993	BJET	10.1111/j.1467-8535.1993.tb00639.x	psychology;mathematics education;educational technology;media;computer science;multimedia;world wide web;pedagogy	HCI	-76.0211953511588	-31.924667436217856	57402

However, the difficulties encountered with the simultaneous introduction of new services and new technologies often impede the accomplishment of set goals. A more prudent and feasible first step might well be to use the new technologies while following existing paradigms. Such a step will then facilitate the transition to new services that capitalize on the new technologies. Abiding by this principle, researchers at Stanford are developing a prototype on-line distance learning system based on recent advances in digital video compression, video servers, and multimedia networking to deliver live and stored video lectures and seminars to students at their desktops. For the sake of concreteness, we are designing this system with the Stanford University Instructional Television Network in mind, as a first step beyond existing video-based instructional services. The prototype system and extensions, however, are general enough to apply to other environments and application domains. >	digital video	Fouad A.

The field of education has been just as vulnerable as statewide budget cuts have forced some U.S. educational institutions to make significant changes to their offerings. Some MIS programs have been especially encumbered by the double shock of a decline in student interest resulting, in part, from the dot.com bubble burst and now, a period of economic recession. Although recent articles have indicated a rise in technology related jobs and have labeled technology jobs as """"recession-proof"""", university student enrollments in the U.S. have not kept pace with the changing headlines.  In MIS classes, professors advocate the strategic implementation of technology to the field of business to enhance competitive strength. One of the tools that is often extolled as a means of evaluating the competitive landscape is that of Porter's Competitive Forces Model. However, although the field of education is a competitive field, minimal research has been conducted using Porter's framework as a means of strengthening an educational program's position nationally, let alone, internally. In this paper, the authors propose utilizing Porter's model as an evaluative tool in the higher educational landscape. The paper begins by examining the current economic condition in the field of Management Information Systems (MIS) followed by an examination of current research in higher education utilizing Porter's Competitive Forces Model. Porter's Model is slightly adapted to fit the educational environment and the framework is then applied to the competitive environment of a MIS program at a regional four year university in the United States. A plan for enhancing the program is proposed based upon the findings of the evaluation."""	dot-com bubble;handbook;information systems;job stream;management information system;microsoft outlook for mac	Dana Schwieger;Ken Surendran	2010		10.1145/1796900.1796957	simulation;engineering;operations management;management	AI	-81.4246622679552	-25.707720026638814	57449

The research reported in this paper is investigating such claims for multimedia in an educational context and for a specific user group: grade-six primary school students. The role of text complexity and text type (descriptive or procedural) in influencing the impact of animation was explored. Design criteria such as the level of semantic integration between text and animation, and the importance of including captions with animations, was also investigated. The initial stages of the research used a commercial CD-ROM multimedia product—Compton's Multimedia Encyclopedia—while the later stages have employed multimedia sequences generated for the purposes of the experiments. The findings to date suggest that the impact of multimedia is subtle. Multimedia produced the greatest relative improvement in recall and inference levels in the case of the simple procedural article, but this was also the article which exhibited the greatest integration of text and animation. Experimentation is continuing to establish whether similarly good results can be obtained with a descriptive article when animation integration is improved. Students who have seen only the text are the most successful at recalling what they have read. The addition of animation to a text produces more impact on inference than on recall, and the multimedia group of students scored more highly than the others on inferencing. At a still higher level of comprehension—the ability to identify the main themes in an article or to enact a procedure described in an article—multimedia demonstrated a clear advantage over text alone.	cd-rom;experiment;semantic integration	Andrew Large;Jamshid Beheshti;Alain Breuleux;Andre Renaud	1994		10.1145/192593.192685	computer vision;semantic integration;simulation;computer science;machine learning;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-71.61491575091276	-45.02732251853784	57515

843e4127adb6206c67adeb1f76c3bfb4c7bf2525	idiomatic composition practices for new musical instruments: context, background and current applications		One of the reasons of why some musical instruments more successfully continue their evolution and actively take part in the history of music is partially attributed to the existing compositions made specifically for them, pieces that remain and are still played over a long period of time. This is something we know, performing these compositions keeps the characteristics of the instruments alive and able to survive. This paper presents our contribution to this discussion with a context and historical background for idiomatic compositions. Looking beyond the classical era, we discuss how the concept of idiomatic music has influenced research and composition practices in the NIME community; drawing more attention in the way current idiomatic composition practices considered specific NIME affordances for sonic, social and spatial interaction. We present particular projects that establish idiomatic writing as a part of a new repertoire for new musical instruments. The idiomatic writing approach to composing music for NIME can shift the unique characteristics of new instruments to a more established musical identity, providing a shared understanding and a common literature to the community.	new interfaces for musical expression;programming idiom	Juan.

cd877a32270fe941bba0cfdbd3d04858f4e3d050	development of youth digital citizenship scale and implication for educational setting		Digital citizens need comprehensive knowledge and technological accessibility to the internet and digital world and teachers have a responsibility to lead them to become digital citizens. However, existing Digital Citizenship Scales contain too broad ranges and do not precisely focus on the target students, so teachers do not have clear criteria for facilitating young people to have digital citizenship, which leads to problems in the direction and goals of digital citizenship education. This study aims to clearly identify the Digital Citizenship Scale for adolescents perceived by teachers who are responsible for their students' digital citizenship education and to present the needs and direction of school-based education to satisfy the identified Digital Citizenship Scales. A five-factor Digital Citizenship Scale called S.A.F.E model, meaning leading character of Self-identity in digital environment, Activity in online(Reasonable Activity and Social/cultural engagement), Fluency for the Digital tools, and Ethics for digital environment, was derived through Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and further cross-validated through Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) with 200 pre-service teachers and in-service teachers. The S.A.F.E model, derived by teachers, shows high reliability and construct validity to be used as a digital citizenship scale for students through concept analysis, EFA, and CFA verification. Based on the theoretically rigorously derived SAFE model, the educational requirements and direction to become active and critical citizens in the online community were discussed.	accessibility;confirmatory factor analysis;digital environment;etiquette in technology;exploratory factor analysis;exploratory testing;formal concept analysis;online community;requirement	Minjeong Kim;Dongyeon Choi	2018	Educational Technology & Society		computer science;media literacy;pedagogy;social media;citizenship	HCI	-75.13982033007379	-35.471868797095894	57807

However, little work has been done to understand how the act of collaboration, through pair programming or group work, impacts a student's knowledge of the benefits and difficulties of collaborative work experience in collaborative work is essential preparation for professional software development. A study was conducted at North Carolina State University to assess changes in advanced undergraduate students' perceptions of pair programming and collaboration. Student personality types, learning styles, and other characteristics were gathered during two semesters of an undergraduate software engineering course. The study found that, after experiencing pair programming, most students indicated a stronger preference to work with another student, believed that pairing made them more organized, and believed that pairing saved time on homework assignments. Students who disliked their collaborative experiences were predominantly reflective learners, introverts, and strong coders. Those students also cited that a non-participatory partner and difficulties scheduling meeting times outside of the classroom were primary reasons for disliking pair programming.

5ba768e6487def15d9203dcdbbac2a973ffb31a2	an interactive 3d social graphs for social learning		In the past time, Social Learning has been the most natural way for people to learn. However, traditional e-learning system only plays a role of teaching assistant, and seldom has functionalities to enhance interaction that can support social learning, like problem discussing and idea brainstorming. Therefore, we try to use the power of social networks to build a social learning environment. In this paper, we use Facebook as the social networks platform and integrate with an e-learning system. Using the social functionalities provided by Facebook, we can enhance discussion and interaction between users. Moreover, we use the social information and learning information to design a recommendation system, providing friend or course recommendation to user, and build a social tool called Interactive 3D Social Graph, providing the features of information 3D visualization and navigation with kinematic gestures. These idea and features can fully support social learning, and enhance more discussion and interaction on learning between users in learning environment.	interactivity;social network	Noorkholis Luthfil Hakim;Shun-Kai Wang;Timothy K.

Students from the four degree programs are assigned to interdisciplinary teams of three to seven members. Each team is assigned a client from a business or non-profit organization in the community. Student teams must work together to plan and produce an integrated set of promotional and/or informational materials for the client, including deliverables for print, web, and video. Students also develop and deliver a series of formal and informal presentations, conduct usability testing for web products, and complete various team management and communication tasks. Because of Cincinnati State's unusual academic calendar, all of the coursework must be accomplished in nine weeks. The capstone course has been offered five times in the past three years. Students are challenged to exercise their highest levels of proficiency, and to integrate technical skills and """"soft skills"""" in an environment that goes far beyond other classroom simulations or case studies. Students may also be """"fired"""" from the course if they do not perform at expected levels of competence. The team-based approach to instruction places significant demands on department faculty to plan and communicate effectively. The instructional team continuously reviews the grading criteria and evaluates the course activities to ensure that the course succeeds in measuring and motivating the best skills of students who are on the verge of completing their degree programs."""	capstone (cryptography);client (computing);computer graphics;information design;simulation;the verge;usability testing;video production;web design	Pamela S.

Seven of these are derived from a psychological conception of what experiencing and experiences are. Three supplementary dimensions spring from the observation that experiences apparently have become especially valuable phenomena in Western societies. The 10 dimensions are tried out in a field study at the Center for Art and Media (ZKM) in Germany with the purpose to study their applicability in the evaluation of interactive sound archives. 29 walk-alongs were carried out with 58 museums visitors. Our analysis showed that it was possible to identify the 10 experience dimensions in the study material. Some dimensions were expressed more frequently than others. The distribution of expressed dimensions and the content of the user comments provided a clear picture of how the two sound archives differed in respect to the experiential qualities.	archive;comment (computer programming);field research;holism;user experience	Marianne Lykke;Christian Jantzen	2016		10.1145/2854946.2854965	user experience design;simulation;computer science;evaluation;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-72.84662877627947	-26.559527087690498	57973

This book grew out of a one semester course which has now been taught for three years at the University of Toronto by the two authors. The first year in which we gave the course, it was offered to first-year students. It was popular, having about ten sections of some 30 students each. Although it was a success, we recognized that the students needed some more maturity, not about computer topics, but about social issues. So, during the next two years, we offered the course to third year students and extension students. For each of these sessions there were about 30 to 40 students participating. In every case, there were many students specializing in computer science, but an appreciable number, perhaps up to one quarter, were students from the humanities, social sciences, engineering, and other disciplines. As a prerequisite for the course, we have insisted on an introductory course in computer science, because we wanted the students to be able to write some programs. We are not convinced that the latter requirement is strictly necessary for the course. From the start, we were determined that this course would not be a soft option for those in computer science. Therefore, we coupled the lectures, with many exercises and supplementary requirements. Usually the first project was that the students design a survey on attitudes toward computing, then conduct the survey, punch the results, and prepare tabulations of the results. We also required that they formulate hypotheses about the significance of the results. For example, whether first-year students differed from third-year students, or male students from female students in their attitudes. Besides the survey, students had to write some programs usually involving traffic simulations in connection with sections of the course on model-ing. In addition, there was one exercise to be carried out on one of the computer assisted instruction courses. This involved preparing a critique of CAI and a comparison of CAI with other teaching modalities within their experience. During the past year, the students have participated in Delphi exercises. Finally , we asked the students, working in small groups, to prepare a research report on a topic of special interest to them, perhaps one in which they had some experience. The net effect of these requirements was to have a course that was considered demanding by many students, and even too demanding by a few. This was particularly true for …	capability maturity model;computer science;embarcadero delphi;experience;requirement;simulation	Calvin C.

Participants in this case study involved student teachers at a private graduate institution on the East Coast in the U.S. and students at a public graduate institution in Luxembourg. In this action research approach, data triangulation involved gathering information through a combination of different instruments such as computer-mediated communication data, needs analyses, journal entries, and post-course questionnaires. Findings showed that in addition to writing collaboratively, groups used the wiki as a discussion tool. This subsequently led to an exploration of the interactions through computer-mediated discourse analysis and a discussion of methodological implications.

A university-wide fellowship scheme gave dedicated time for course creation, support in teaching online and using WebCT software. A feedback questionnaire showed high student satisfaction with predominantly online delivery. The majority of the 46 students performed well in both group and individual assignments. WebCT monitoring facilities showed that some accessed the course notes or used communication tools considerably more than others, with some correlation between higher participation and the achievement of higher grades. Revised plans include allowing more time for studying online, more face-to-face sessions and more explicit requirements for virtual attendance and use of the communication tools. Overall, online learning is considered appropriate for teaching this subject, given the extent of use of the Web by community information providers and the growth of community networks.

Design/methodology/approach – The approach takes various forms, including needs assessment, literature review, impact analysis, environmental scanning and strategic planning. Findings – Cloud computing has a great impact on systems librarianship. There is not enough evidence to prove that such environmental changes will likely obviate the need for systems librarians in the near future. Systems librarians must upgrade their knowledge and skills to meet the new demands of the change. Originality/value – At the time of this literature review, few publications were dedicated to the discussion of cloud computing and systems librarianship. This article is intended to fill the gap of the literature in this area.	cloud computing;librarian	Weiling Liu;Huibin Cai	2013	OCLC Systems & Services	10.1108/10650751311294528	cloud computing;computer science;knowledge management;multimedia;library classification	HPC	-77.46420776411227	-27.06384017530176	58175

Their use is particularly interesting in small teams to serve as a support for group communication, for co-ordination, as well as for creating collaborative document products. In spite of the very real appeal of the wiki for these purposes, there is a serious challenge due to their complexity. Team members can have difficulty identifying the structure and salient elements of the wiki. This paper describes the design of WikiNavMap, an alternative visual representation for wikis, which provides an overview of the wiki structure. Based on analysis of student wikis, we identified factors that help team members identify which wiki pages are currently relevant to them. We hypothesised that a structural overview coupled with the visual representations of these factors could assist users with wiki navigation decisions. We report a preliminary evaluation with a large group wiki, created over a full university semester by a group of ten users. The results are promising for a small wiki but point to challenges in coping with the complexity of a larger one.	web page;wiki	Adam John Ullman;Judy Kay	2007		10.1145/1240866.1241067	personal wiki;visualization;human–computer interaction;communication in small groups;computer science;knowledge management;web page;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-70.55601758937956	-41.3349649355679	58340

From the days when someone stood around a dormitory door waiting for someone else to open it, pretending to have forgotten his or her key, to today where virtually every college student has at least one online entity. Instant Messaging programs and Social Networking websites such as MySpace, Facebook, Ruckus, Friendster, LinkedIn, SecondLife, and even YouTube, encourage students to create online versions of themselves in an effort to share information and meet new people. While in theory this process may sound harmless, students are not only unwittingly allowing themselves to be targets of identity thieves, but they are also posing major security threats to university and college networks.  In a recent class demonstration, it was shown how a simple homemade application can be launched unknowingly through Internet Explorer (IE) using Web2.0 to disable IE, even with security settings at a high level. If a simple homemade application can disable IE without the knowledge of the user, imagine what is being distributed through MySpace bulletins and comments. I intend to conduct interviews with security experts and surveys of college students, to show students they unknowingly open themselves, and their campus networks, to malicious attacks. With the proper security solutions in place at the network layer, along with much needed user education, the dangers posed by social engineering can be minimized.	high-level programming language;instant messaging;internet explorer;network security;second life;social engineering (security);web 2.0;net	Robert Gibson	2007		10.1145/1294046.1294077	engineering;advertising;internet privacy;world wide web	Security	-67.76630408401623	-30.794098833824112	58348

Although several studies highlighted the benefits of gamification in many applications, its potential in the \emph{enterprise} environment still needs to be fully understood.  This work contributes to the studies in enterprise gamification with an experiment performed at a large multinational company. The experiment involved 206 employees for a period of 2 months. We describe a modular and extensible framework for enterprise gamification, designed to seamlessly integrate with existing enterprise-class Web systems. We studied how a gamified tool can help to foster employees' engagement with such systems, by making day-to-day tasks more stimulating.  We show how different game mechanics can help to achieve two business needs, namely social interaction and learning. To this end, we exploited the gamification framework to develop a Q&A Web application combined with learning, news sharing, and social connections capabilities. Results provide strong evidence of how a gamified experience can foster learning and social behaviour in employees, and provide new insights about the effectiveness of several game mechanics in an enterprise context.	business requirements;game mechanics;gamification;web application	Laurentiu Catalin Stanculescu;Alessandro Bozzon;Robert-Jan Sips;Geert-Jan Houben	2016		10.1145/2818048.2820061	social science;simulation;human–computer interaction;social behavior;knowledge management;multimedia;management;social psychology;world wide web	Web+IR	-65.22555778625636	-38.748249959823816	58372

However, while there has been research into links between eyetracking metrics and usability problems, this has so far fallen short of establishing a general correlation scheme between the two. Consequently, practitioners are left to make subjective judgements when interpreting eye-tracking data. We address the lack of general guidance by proposing an initial correlation scheme based on data from an exploratory study which aimed to find a wide range of possible correlations between usability problems and eye-tracking patterns. User testing of two websites was conducted and a set of diverse usability problems was extracted from the data; these were then analysed and some were correlated with users’ eye-tracking patterns. In addition to this initial correlation scheme, a further finding from this study is that usability problems are connected to not just a single eye-tracking pattern, but to a specific sequence of patterns. This sequence of patterns seems to arise from different coping strategies that users develop when a problem is experienced.	eye tracking;scheme;user research;web usability	Claudia Ehmke;Stephanie Wilson	2007		10.1145/1531294.1531311	usability goals;pluralistic walkthrough;think aloud protocol;web usability;component-based usability testing;cognitive walkthrough;usability;human–computer interaction;computer science;rite method;usability engineering;multimedia;tree testing;heuristic evaluation;world wide web;usability lab;usability inspection	HCI	-63.37185111825302	-46.9779378815289	58387
